B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is a movie that only comes around once in a while and I was looking forward to it for so long. Sure it did not meet all of my expectations but it has proved to be a far better film than most I have seen in the past... I don't know... 5 years or more. I can understand if you do not like this film because it asks you to treat film as more of a creative artform and most of the viewing public has been dumbed down by what hollywood calls film at this point in time.<br /> Now most people want to claim that Drive just pulls from other indie movies like Taxi Driver. The lone brooding male lead falls for the girl and everything goes out of control. But I am more of an optimist and would like to think that Drive brought something new and exciting to film. There is great cinematography in this movie plus very thoughtful performances from the cast. Gosling steals the show and he doesn't even have to say that much to convince me he is a sociopathic mechanic with a heart of gold and a hammer of justice.<br /> That jacket I was not as convinced of when I saw the trailer, but when I saw it for the first time in the movie I realized there could be no other. It is perfect for the film and creates an other-worldly character that I am sure others will model themselves after just like James Dean and Steve Mcqueen. I understand; when Refn talks about how he created this film as a fairy tale, that it works in that way. We kind of know the setting but it is never explained. We don't know what era it is exactly because it some how looks like the 80's but they have cell phones. Also the main character seems to have superhuman abilities but is flawed by his personality. I am not going to give away anything more specific because this movie needs to be viewed as a whole without prejudice or prior knowledge.<br /> The soundtrack was amazing and fit perfectly into the whole vibe and setup of this movie from the pink lettering I found myself humming these songs all week after the movie, butnot my usual taste.<br /> Drive is now one of my favortie movies. I was dissappointed that it was snubbed by the awards because of hoolywood's infatuation with itself and old black and white film(the artist). If you can understand how you don't need a full script with a bunch of bad dialogue to tell a story then you will like Drive. Judge it for yourself, but in no way should this movie go unrecognized.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Although it is slated for a much younger audience, I found it an entertaining quick read. This is a story of courage, loyalty, perseverance, and devotion in a war torn setting. And although Michael tells this story through the eyes of a horse who was pushed into war, I felt empathy for all, man and beast, who had to endure the rigorous perils of war. His story painted a picture that was forlorn, yet a thread of hope intertwined throughout and provided a lovely ending to the story. All in all, I felt that Michael provided a glimpse into the horrors of World War I and truly captured the noble essence of the story's hero, Joey the War Horse.
0739368044|5.0|The author and the reader makes the book alive and fun to read!!!  I have enjoyed this and the other titles of this author!!
B005QUQP76|1.0|I was happy to receive my Corsair M60. I have high expectations on Corsair products as I've known them to be a company with great product quality. I really thought it was the best mouse I have ever used until after one day of using it just stopped working. The mouse cursor just suddenly stopped moving. (Can you imagine your shooting your friends on an FPS game then suddenly your mouse stops working, How annoying could that be?).  At first the issue was intermittent. What I did was unplug the cord and reconnect it then the mouse starts working again. I was pissed a bit because of that issue so I went out and when I came back the mouse stopped working completely. No matter how many times I unplug and reconnect it to the USB port and on different USB ports found at the back and even in the USB ports at the front panel it won't work. I've tried almost every USB port in my computer it wouldn't work. In just one day. Just one day after it arrived the mouse stopped working. I've contacted Corsair and told them about my issue and I'm waiting for their reply. I doubt this will be fixed by installing a driver or some software as the laser light at the base of the mouse won't turn on. I'll probably get an RMA but we'll see when Corsair tech support will reply. I will update this review and change the rating if necessary but as of the moment I give this thing a one star. I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />================================<br /><br />I did get an RMA. After trying all USB ports, adjusting the mouse configuration, and re-flashing the firmware the mouse is now recognized as KBD Boot loader. It tracks but it's really slow. I can't flash the firmware again as it returns an error. The mouse software(beta 2.x) doesn't recognize the hardware. I'm returning this thing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use... nice way to get my Bible reading done... nice way to stay on track.  Always a new plan to follow... something for everyone!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Got my KINDLE FIRE last month and was not sure what to buy for a cover. Sat next to someone in the doctors office who had this cover in PINK  (PINK so she could find it in her handbag).  Hope I see her again to say thank you for the great recomendation.  Light weight and sturdy and pretty.  So glad I bought this one.
B000FA57RG|5.0|Though they did not show the full segment of Vogue at the opening of the tour, this was still a great DVD. The CD is great and includes my favorites Vogue, Nobody Knows Me, and American Life. I learned alot about Madonna (Madge) on this tour and how religious of a person she is. She may not be as mean to everybody as she is in Truth or Dare she still shows signs that she's Madonna. Showing that she's Madonna includes the foul language that we're use to from her, plus some new aspects thast we didn't  see in Truth or Dare. I do wish that they would put the Re Invention Tour out on DVD so that we could see the full show finally, this is a good DVD.  I love Madonna and this is one of her best tours, I hope that she does some of the old songs that she did on this tour on her new tour following the release of MDNA,and include some new songs for this tour that she hasn't brought back yet like American Life and Nobody Knows Me. I hope Madonna continues to put out great tours and music that we expect from her.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is enjoyable for the whole family. it has a lot.of different ones to.chose from. I love this game
B005HSG3VK|5.0|would highly recommend, light, not bulky, excellent protection.  So delighted bought a second as a gift for another fire owner.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I absolutely love what HBO has done with this series so far, I cannot wait for season 2. Every episode leaves me wanting more. So excited to finally have season 1 on Blu-ray to re-watch before the next season begins.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|If you don't have this app you should get it. Keeps all my passwords organized and can easily backup us m backup.
B002ZG97LK|3.0|Definitely made for today's generation.  Different sountrack from the original, Ren's Mom is gone, Ren's from some other city (not Chicago), his friend Willard is very hard to understand.  Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father seemed stiff in this, it just wasn't moving fluidly along. Ariel's boyfriend looked about 30 yrs. old. When playing \\"chicken\\" they used a school bus?  LOL.  Beaumont is now Bomont?<br />  Rap garbage music infiltrated this movie, not the place for it, along with line dancing to rap music? Odd.  Some movies just should be left alone as originals. Where'd most of the original music go?  They replaced it, ugh!  Go with the 1984 version.  The soundtrack rocked and so did the acting, dancing and the movie!  I'm sure those that are 30 yrs. and younger will like this movie.  I'm early 40's and have better taste than this. I thought I'd give it a shot.  Hey they remade True Grit and it wasn't a flop so I've heard.  Footloose- It's ok to pass a couple of hours, but not a keeper.
B004SIP8SY|4.0|There's no doubt that Kill Bill, Vol. 1 was the better film.  It had more gore, more shock and awe events, and more martial arts-sword fighting action.  Quentin Tarantino's signature movie-making style is all here, but this time, he toned it down a bit and decided to focus more on plot.  That's certainly not a bad thing, as he wraps up the entire backstory here nicely.  I just wish there was more \\"mmph\\" in this film, at least on par with Vol. 1.  For that, it gets 4 stars rather than 5.<br /><br />Blu-ray quality is the same as Vol. 1: crystal-clear picture and great sound.<br /><br />FOUR STARS
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bought the Omnibus edition (very inexpensive) of Wool, based off of Amazon's recommendations for me.  It was right up my alley.  The reader knows just a tiny bit more than the main characters as the story progresses, which makes for riveting reading.  Sometimes with inexpensive Kindle books, you end up with some sloppy writing.  Not the case here.  Thoroughly readable and enjoyable.  Only complaint: I wish there was a Wool 6!
B004SIP8OI|5.0|\\"Revenge is a dish best served cold...\\"<br /><br />Ain't that the truth?!  Without a doubt, we have another Tarantino winner on our hands!  \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is up there with Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds.  It's apparent that Quentin wanted to incorporate a western and martial arts theme into this movie, and he pulls it off nicely.  His signature \\"shock and awe\\" style of action is all here, and the sword-fighting in this film is some of the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that I think he shouldn't have cast Uma Thurman to play the role of The Bride, but hey, whatever floats his boat (which has now long floated by for this film).  As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the picture is 5-star quality, and the sound is crystal-clear.  Hearing The Bride's sword swathe through the air with that metallic din resonated off my tympanic membrane with sheer bliss.<br /><br />Nice work, Quentin baby!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to study Gods word an very easy to navigate! !!!!  I would recommend to even the youngest study group.  Keep up the great work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is just so cool its a great time waster and its fun I would strongly regimens you get this app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to pick this up lest it be another twilight, but I can honestly say I really enjoyed it.  It's not just for kids or teens.  In fact, it has some pretty graphic scenes, which makes me move the needle to late teens/early twenties, but everyone can enjoy it without feeling like the book talks below them.  The author does a great job of making you guess what's happening next.  She had me fooled multiple times and my predictions were all wrong.  Great book!  Must read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Omg I love all the games my point exactly its not just one game!! its a cool way to kill time and and not be bored love love love this app.
B007H51DQG|4.0|I enjoy the show, but it's dragging now.<br />I do like that the show takes poetic license and strays from the comic series.<br />I guess they are trying to show the depth of the main characters.<br />But what about the other characters?<br />I guess we will see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this games is so fun and there is a lot to do to pass time. although some of the games are stupid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the.best game ever made WHY ARE THERE NOT MORE LIKE THIS!!!!!! I can not waite for the.next one<br />:D HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0307957934|4.0|The timeliness of this subject and the author's writing style make this book a must read in one sitting. -- About twenty pages in I found myself unable to put it down.  My only complaint is that the book takes place over the course of 24 hours -- 24 fantastically intriguing hours, but this subject with this author's talent truly deserved more time to enable the characters to fully develop. --I would have liked more depth to the sole female character, in particular.  Another 50 -100 pages to really sink your teeth in would make it stellar.  This is my first Harris novel and I am hooked.  To my mind he is equal parts journalist, historian, professor, and masterful storyteller.  Well worth the read!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I never bought any of the star wars movies for me before (but i did purchase the trilogy dvd packs as a gift for a friend though ...long ago)but this time and since was blu-ray and all the enhance picture and sound quality that comes with it i finally decided to get it for good.<br />the movies are great, the sound perfect, the bonus discs are awesome but the package makes me feel not THAT happy at all, overall is not bad, but is not good either, and considering the money you are paying for this i think we should be getting something better than this, for instance the original movie covers for each movie, specially if you are a collector and the small insert booklet does not really gives you anything special either like at least a few words review of each movie, or pictures or something.<br />in the review for the movies i would be giving 5 stars because I like them all or because you can have them in one single box but the packaging is what i feel drops down this collection, this is just my feeling this is not gonna make 20thC.FOX change their minds and give something in return ...ever and they just want to push for their previous releases and of course for the forthcoming 3D versions on BD which I guess as this one, the packaging is not gonna be 'definitive' item.
B0052U59F4|2.0|Okay so I'll admit that I purchased this book out of curiosity. I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. It wasn't bad but it wasn't stellar either. After all of the praise it's receiving, I simply expected more. I can somewhat see the Twilight tie in even though this is a completely different type of story. I love books with strong female leads and Ana just didn't do it for me. She was juvenile, too easily influenced and seemed too interested in Christian's physical appearance and attractiveness to care about anything else. This is not the stuff that realistic stories are built on. Christian's mood swings made me want to smack him, for Ana. He was bossy, aloof and basically cold. Why Ana found this attractive, I have no clue. And the losing her virginity scene, it was the worst! It made me cringe. I love a good BDSM but this didn't cut it. If you are going to commit yourself to writing BDSM you have to use the lingo. \\"Down there\\" is no substitute for the myriad of words that can be implemented to describe body parts. The repeating of phrases and words, constant descriptions of Christian's handsome features and Ana's use of holy + (you fill in the word of your choice) drove me insane! And what was all that email business...a way for the author to drag out the story? Some parts were like a train wreck, you know you shouldn't look but you just can't help it. If this is what the masses are swarming to as \\"Erotica\\" I think erotica writers are in big trouble. I purchased this book for 6.99 and I now see that it is 9.99. There is no way I'd spend ten dollars for this! I probably won't be continuing the series. If I want a good BDSM or erotica there are many other writers who aren't afraid to put it out there for the reader. I'm stunned and disappointed that this book has received the attention that it has.
1849164169|5.0|This is a stunner. Kerr takes us back to 1941 where Bernie is installed as Heydrich's personal body guard and house detective.<br /><br />Heydrich is now the 'ruler' of Bohemia and Moravia and is busy planning a more efficient way of 'eliminating' the Jewish population.<br /><br />Just after Bernie is installed as pet detective one of Heydrich's adjutants is murdered in his room. This gives the reader a locked room mystery as the core of the story. There are also side shows involving Czech terrorists and Bernie's latest love interest.<br /><br />Of the six stories I have read in this series this is by far the best. The main positive is the author has had the courage to go back in time and not continue with the post war stories, a couple of which in my opinion were a bit thin.<br /><br />Along with a good mystery we have more of the sickening history of Nazism, with many of the characters being real people.<br /><br />And to cap it off the book has one of the best first pages I have ever read.<br />A very good story indeed.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This movie combines theoretical physics, suspense, romance, and a little religion. it is far fetched but also realistic. One of my favorites!
B004LROUW2|5.0|Murakami may not appeal to everyone.  However, he has a great knack for sucking you in if you are willing to suspend some of the obvious doubts of his reality.  From the first chapter I was hooked and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It has elements of Sci-Fi (which I typically don't care for) and mystery mixed with a story of love and fate.  It is methodical pacing that picks up subtly over the course of the book until you can't bear to put it down.  Totally enjoyable for me.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|love this app. the scrollable widget make me use this app full time. you can tell the Dev has serious time to make this useful &amp; also please different people.
B0060Q962Q|3.0|I tried this because it was free. I guess I'm spoiled because I expect a lot more from the apps I download. The description is accurate... this is just a Connect Four game... nothing fancy.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Sometimes duet albums seem to happen too late in a career. Not so with Mr Bennett. He`s still an amazing vocalist and lots of the partners he chose to duet with make this a worthy album to own IMO.<br /><br />Well done Tony !!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game and wish I could find more like it! I haven't seen it done a dozen times. The graphics are great, there are several different game play modes, and it is one of those &quot;can't put it down&quot; games. I play it on Kindle Fire.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|Finally - a symphonic metal album that is worthy of the genre. It felt like the genre was just turning into female-fronted pop bands. This album is going to be a classic, and will hopefully rejuvenate the other bands out there. The song-writing is terrific. The entire album is balanced with power and beauty to creating an amazing sonic journey. Get it now - your ears will thank you!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I didn't really want to try this because I thought it was just for kids... boy was I wrong! This is a fun and challenging game for all! I only wish I had bought the ad-free version.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|wonderful lyrics, strong voice, & melody to die for!! was not disappointed! Adele has a bright future ahead of her. Amazon has delivered again!  Love them!!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire to keep track of many different lists (to do, groceries, etc). I also use it to jot down brief notes.  Give it a try!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Great information in this \\"homegrown\\" movie. Everyone who is interested in what fracking could possibly do to our environment and water should purchase this and pass it around!!!!
B004SBX112|4.0|This is a great sequel to Angry Birds. I think the ad-free version is worth $.99! Lots of new challenges.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game sucks the to to to to to to tit to monkey balls he h's he he he he
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game consistently gets good reviews,  but I was skeptical.  It is definitely worth the small price! Makes you think but is accessible to all
B001ED7C58|5.0|The music in this soundtrack is an eclectic mix of hard hitting rock, to rockabilly, to haunting instrumentals.  The diversity is what makes it so much fun to listen to.  It is by far the best soundtrack I have heard in a long time.  Not only is it stellar musically, it captures the mood and flow of the movie itself. The only song I don't love is, Never Think, sung by Rob Pattinson.  His voice irritates me, but his guitar playing is wonderful.  Great soundtrack to workout to as well!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I get hooked on this game. It works really well on my kindle fire. I highly recommend it.<br />Be careful you might lose track of time.
0316098329|4.0|I found that once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  It's written from the perspective of a young child so at first it takes a little getting used to because he describes the world as a child would. Once you get beyond that, its quite enjoyable.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The higher levels get pretty challenging. I can't wait to get more levels added. some of the levels go too quick.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Nice app which works well on the Kindle Fire.  It gets more familiar as it is used.  It's easy to set up with a Google mail account.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this album sooooo much! Adele's voice is insanely good!!! My faves are \\"Set Fire To the Rain\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\". You can't go wrong with this album.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|best g reader app I've used.  A major thing for me Since I use my Fire for reading extensively. It's actually the major reason I bought the Fire. I can keep up with my tech news without having to be at the computer.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game, whenever I need to kill some time,  I play Spider Solitaire. Awesome game, good job MobilityWare!
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I HAVE DOWNLOADED ALOT OF GAMES THEN DELETED THEM .THIS ONE STAYS.!!! I LOVE THE GRAPHiCS. A KEEPER. VERY FUN,AND FREE!
B0055S348W|2.0|I purchased the premium version for $12 (a lot for an app) and I can print pretty much anything except Pdt files (which are most of my files). When you try to print a Pdt from a kindle fire you get a tendering error. I contacted the manufacturer and got no help other than the suggestion to reinstal, which I did to no avail. A bad app for the fire.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have been a Phantom lover since high school. I will be 40 this year. It's been a long love affair. I have read the Phantom of Manhatten and was concerned when I first learned about this production. I wasn't a huge fan of the book. This production is based off of that. Changes have been made, that make this much better. I ordered the music when it first came out and loved what I heard. This past week I was finally able to see this exact version. It came to American movie theaters. It was simply stunning. I just loved every inch of it. I loved how parts of the old music were woven into the new production. The ending will never be the happy ever after ending we Phantom fans dream of, but I still enjoyed this one very much. Everyone in the production were amazing. I can't wait for the dvd to be released so I can own it forever. Just an incredible job. If you are a Phantom fan and you haven't seen it, buy it. You won't regret it.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Even though the wait was long, it was well worth it. I really love all of the tracks on this album, and while the sound my be different than in some of the previous albums, at its core, it's still Evanescence, and I loved every minute of it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its really good. Because it saves your game. Not when you get a new kindle. There's different levls .Theres other angry birds games you. cheriy
B0063GORYU|5.0|Purchased for the Kindle Fire. (Note: this review is for the free version.) Everything seems to be here; there are choices for one to four suit play; several backgrounds and card backs for variety, though not very many; and options for score and stat tracking. The touch/drag system occasionally causes errors, but I think this is more due to the size of my fingers than anything else. The ads for the free version aren't terribly intrusive, I've only seen them upon a new deal; and there is always a skip button. Overall, since this is the MOST used app on my Fire at the moment, I have to give it a 10/10. Well done MobilityWare!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I own this game on the DSi and glad I found for my kindle fire. Great app. Quite a few ads though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm in the middle of a very demanding class that requires a lot of study time.  Hence, I had to set my greatest love aside - reading fiction - until I finished this class.  Oh well, the best laid plans... A friend of mine demanded I get to reading \\"Wool\\" assuring me it was such a quick read, I could probably \\"finish it in the bathroom.\\"  Despite my feeble protests, I bought \\"Wool Omnibus Edition\\" and got to reading it (not in the bathroom).  Then I couldn't stop (okay, I did read a little bit in the bathroom).  After quickly finishing Book 1, I *had* to proceed to Book 2.  Well, Book 2 left me hanging off a cliff, so I *had* to read Book 3.  Book 3 left me clinging by my fingernails to the spiral staircase railing, so I *had* to read Book 4.  Book 4 - well, I'm sure you get the picture.<br /><br />Not only has Howey written a riveting story, a dystopic future set in a silo, he writes his characters so well that you *know* they exist and need you to keep reading to find out what happens to them.  Thank you, Mr. Howey, for sharing your talents with the world.  If I happen to see you at a book signing, I'll be the photograstalker lurking in the background.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]

B0068RHGJM|3.0|I love the band nightwish. There were some songs on this new album I liked, \\"Ghost River\\". But some songs were to close to a punk feel for me like \\"StoryTime\\". Anette sometimes sounds as if she is yelling also, and not quite singing. My advice, listen to all the demos here on Amazon, then download the songs you like and make a cd of your own.
0385512058|2.0|There is some useful advice in here, but it is buried under a whole lot of self-aggrandizing. Also, Ferrazzi comes off as pushy and overly schmoozy, someone who only collects acquaintances in the hopes that he can use them some time in the future. Sort of a waste of time/money, at least for me.

B0015AARJI|4.0|Okay so I need to warn everybody. Apparently their seems to be 2 different packaged ps3 controllers. The one with the red packaging or blue black. Otherwise, the plastic wrapped one. And the other that seems to be official. One is 35.99 and the other is 54.99. From what I can tell the cheaper of the two does seems to have a sort of delay, while the more expensive one seems more responsive and slightly better quality.<br /><br />The more expensive controller worked right away but the cheaper one had some programming issue. Now from the packaging they both say Sony on them but the cheaper one I'm not sure it's the official product. So I'm going to pick this up and see which one this is. I will post up later and possibly even a video.
0765356147|5.0|I read fantasy exclusively and added Brandon Sanderson to my list of absolute favorites. Mistborn Trilogy is about a thief-heroine in a world plagued by mists and falling ash. I find the Allomancy magic system (acquiring transient physical/mental abilities using various metals) unique and brilliant, the plot skillfully directed, characters sufficiently developed and believable, and Mr. Sanderson's gradual approach to reveal the environment and magics quite effective.<br /><br />Book 1 (The Final Empire) is the best among the trilogy. Vin comes of age and learns of her rare abilities as a mistborn in a time of rebellion. Allomantic pulling/pushing against metals is exciting but may seem odd (only at first) since it superficially resembles comic book superhero powers. Book 2 (The Well of Ascension) tells of war among kings after the empire's collapse. The plot's dark mysteries are spine-chilling and the action is more dramatic particularly the Duralumin metal-enhanced sequences. And humankind fights to survive in book 3 (The Hero of Ages) against a force which exists singularly to destroy the world.<br /><br />Story length feels right and not forced unlike other multi-volume series, and books 1 & 2 both finish really strong with immersive and climactic endings. However, dialogues and narratives get repetitive and overly explanatory, the pace and certain events in book 3 appear somewhat slow and superfluous, and to me the finale is familiar and leaves mixed feelings.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will read Jordan's Wheel of Time series but I know Mr. Sanderson was specifically chosen to finish it which speaks volumes about his skill as a writer. Altogether, I thoroughly enjoyed Mistborn, skipping its stand-alone sequel, The Alloy of Law.

0765350386|5.0|I read fantasy exclusively and added Brandon Sanderson to my list of absolute favorites. Mistborn Trilogy is about a thief-heroine in a world plagued by mists and falling ash. I find the Allomancy magic system (acquiring transient physical/mental abilities using various metals) unique and brilliant, the plot skillfully directed, characters sufficiently developed and believable, and Mr. Sanderson's gradual approach to reveal the environment and magics quite effective.<br /><br />Book 1 (The Final Empire) is the best among the trilogy. Vin comes of age and learns of her rare abilities as a mistborn in a time of rebellion. Allomantic pulling/pushing against metals is exciting but may seem odd (only at first) since it superficially resembles comic book superhero powers. Book 2 (The Well of Ascension) tells of war among kings after the empire's collapse. The plot's dark mysteries are spine-chilling and the action is more dramatic particularly the Duralumin metal-enhanced sequences. And humankind fights to survive in book 3 (The Hero of Ages) against a force which exists singularly to destroy the world.<br /><br />Story length feels right and not forced unlike other multi-volume series, and books 1 & 2 both finish really strong with immersive and climactic endings. However, dialogues and narratives get repetitive and overly explanatory, the pace and certain events in book 3 appear somewhat slow and superfluous, and to me the finale is familiar and leaves mixed feelings.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will read Jordan's Wheel of Time series but I know Mr. Sanderson was specifically chosen to finish it which speaks volumes about his skill as a writer. Altogether, I thoroughly enjoyed Mistborn, skipping its stand-alone sequel, The Alloy of Law.

0985081821|5.0|The Forever Girl is one of the best debut novels I've read, and I don't say that lightly (Disclaimer: I received a free digital copy of this book from the author, but my opinions of the book are still my own). The story evolves around Sophia, a young woman who has been ostracized by her town because of her personal views. As she begins putting the pieces together to understand her \\"family curse\\" which causes her to hear a persistent buzzing, she is led to discover the secrets of the universe - complete with \\"vampires\\" that aren't really vampires, \\"shapeshifters\\" and other supernatural creatures. Hamilton creates a complex and highly original world, and best of all - it makes sense!<br /><br />Sophia was a great character, well rounded, and very human. On one hand, I wasn't sure why she wouldn't tell anyone about the noise in her head, but having been harshly judged for her beliefs and lifestyle (even by her own mother) I can also understand the trust issues. Given my background, growing up in the bible-belt, I related to Sophia's character, and enjoyed her reactions to the \\"Christian\\" passages and arguments provided throughout the book. Although I've never been Wiccan, I could relate to her worldview, and I absolutely loved her reactions to the stereotypes attributed to Wicca. And then there's Charles, what more could we want from Charles? He provided counterpoint and balance to Sophia, all while maintaining his irresistible sexiness.<br /><br />As anyone who regularly reads my reviews, I rarely leave a book without a few complaints (for verification of this you can ask the professor who assigned his own book for me to review in grad school). A word of caution, a slight *spoiler* follows, so proceed to the end of this paragraph with caution. My biggest problem with the story was Sophia's constant obsession that she would grow old, and Charles may not. She's a young woman, so it seems like she'd have plenty of time to deal with this issue before she's hobbling aroundwith a walker. I can understand her mulling over it in the back of her mind, but not obsessing over it. However, a nice twist to this mess was her desire for Charles to become mortal rather than become immortal herself. It's nice to see an author who doesn't completely romanticize the idea of immortality. (So there was my complaint and a compliment all wrapped up with a nice imaginary bow.)<br /><br />My verdict -  I can't wait to find out what happens next in the series! So, don't get left behind, get out there and buy this book! I'll definitely be rereading this one.

B006HGXGWU|3.0|TAKE SHELTER is a perplexing film.  Is it basically a portrait of a man's descent into madness?  Or is it a parable of a prophet warning people of impending doom?  And is the climax merely a dream---or the prophet's fulfillment?<br />I can appreciate complexity in plotting but can be frustrated when the writers don't commit to a fully told story.  That's what keeps me from having a totally satisfactory experience.<br />I certainly can't fault the actors.  Michael Shannon gives a devastatingly real performance as the tormented husband/father who fears he may be losing his mind.  The ubiquitous Jessica Chastain adds another star in her growing career as the wife who takes her vows seriously.  She and Shannon are truly believable as the couple and the heart of the movie.<br />TAKE SHELTER requires patience--it moves slowly and the director uses pauses and silence often to emphasize the gravity of Shannon's dilemma.  Shannon's eruption at the Lions Club dinner is handled brilliantly.  His performance is Oscar-worthy although he got snubbed.  He and Chastain will be holding one of those statuettes in the future, I'm sure.<br />TAKE SHELTER is an impressive film but may not be for everyone.
0061537934|3.0|Being an animal lover and also getting a recommendation from my dad, I had high expectations for this book. Maybe that was the problem to begin with. I started it with much anticipation and as I was reading my large grin implanted on my face started to falter. I really wasn't enjoying it but I had to keep on. Which I'm glad I did because I ended up liking it for most part. The book is done by the family dog's point of view. Which most of the time was cute. A lot of the book was done around racing as well. I guess this is a big place where this book fell short for me. Especially in the beginning. I'm not a race fan and don't care for it at all but that's what was talked about throughout most of the book. Sometimes it was okay when they gave little snip-its of racing quotes or thoughts but sometimes it seemed to go on and on which quite bored me. There were some funny parts (like the evil zebra, eating peppers for the twins, etc) but for most part the book was just okay for me.
0756405890|5.0|I read a few one star reviews of this book, which I consider the best fantasy book that I have read in years, to gain some perspective on what people did not like about it.  I cannot say that I remotely agree with their conclusions.  I found this book fascinating, truly fascinating.<br /><br />This book is about a person of great talent, drive, and ambition given great obstacles and not succumbing to them.  It is a book about how being amazing and talented does not prevent you from experiencing failure, loss, and pain.  It is a book about youth, and being a stupid young adult making stupid yet believable choices.  It is about things not going according to plan and misjudging.<br /><br />To some extent, it is a book rising above circumstance, but the dark foreshadowing keeps you reading.  As you watch the young Kvothe overcome his opposition, you know in the back of your mind that he will be broken, and this amazing talent will eventually be silenced and tucked away in a backwoods, ready to die.<br /><br />This book is nearly literary in its style, and is not dumbed down.  The writing is beautiful, and is the first book in a very long time that I did not take to skimming in parts.  It is one of the few books I have read in which I have found the Kindle frequently highlighted passages to be somewhat profound or clever.<br /><br />In short, this is a rare and beautiful fantasy.

0307593312|1.0|I don't know what the literary reviewers have been smoking. I know high school students who can write better than this.<br /><br />What's wrong with IQ84? Let me count the ways:<br /><br />1. Plot development. I cannot emphasize how exhausting it is to read a book where you are constantly grasping at meaningful plot development only to fall short over and over again. Finally I realized... it wasn't me!<br /><br />It isn't just enough to come up with interesting ideas and throw them at the reader. They have to form some kind of coherent plot. What the hell do the Little People do, anyway? Why was Sakigake wrapped up with them in the first place? What is the point of a maza and a dohta and why isn't this properly explained anywhere? Why do the Little People care about mazas and dohtas? Why is there so much buildup around how crazy the Sakigake cult is and then... nothing? Do the Little People get Fuka Eri in the end? And can someone please explain to me why we're supposed to care about any of this?<br /><br />2. Pacing. The big development - Tengo having sex with a seventeen-year-old and getting Aomame pregnant by proxy - happens halfway through the book leaving the author sort of grasping at ways to extend the second half any way he can. Like other reviewers, I too was skipping entire paragraphs - nay, pages - by the end because all of it seemed so extraneous. The book should be cut down at least a third.<br /><br />3. Language. I could stand the nonsensical plot if it was paired with striking, thought-provoking prose. But it isn't. Don't even get me started on the sex scenes.<br /><br />4. How hyped this book was. If there is anything worse than a bad book, it is a bad book being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Like I said, the professional reviewers must have been on crack or something.<br /><br />This book sucks. Period. Don't waste your time or your money.

1442419814|5.0|This book was suspensful and interesting. I loved the idea of an ugly to pretty operation and the real truth behind it.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Classical audiophiles over a certain age will fondly remember Mercury Living Classics LPs.  I am not part of that generation, but I vividly recall putting Byron Janis' LP on the turntable (\\"recorded on 35MM magnetic film\\", the label trumpeted) back in the 1980s.  I put my headphones on, and was blown away, thinking \\"What, this was recorded in the 1960s? How did they get it to sound this great?\\"<br /><br />\\"Simplicity is wisdom\\" is a succinct way to describe Mercury's approach to recording.  Build top notch recording equipment, select the right microphone, find the best placement - and get out of the way while the artists do their thing.  To an extent, this was also the approach used by RCA during their Living Stereo heyday.  Mercury went RCA one better by hauling a customized truck with their recording equipment wherever they went - even to Moscow.  But by the time Mercury had stopped making records, RCA had lost its way in the confusion of multi-miking, and it wasn't until the early digital era that Telarc resurrected Mercury's guiding principles.  This is, on balance, the best sounding pre-digital boxed set you're going to hear, and some of these recordings still sound better than their digital descendants.<br /><br />By hiring second tier (not second rate) orchestras and soloists who were not household names - but were willing to work harder than their higher priced counterparts - Mercury was able to obtain excellent results on a budget.  Mercury quickly built a stable of artists including conductors Howard Hanson (also a composer) and Antal Dorati, pianists Byron Janis and Gina Bachauer, violinist Henryk Szeryng, and cellist Janos Starker.  Janis and Szeryng had already recorded for RCA, but were attracted to Mercury by the opportunity to pick which repertoire to record, rather than having it assigned to them by A & R.<br /><br />Much of that repertoire leans toward the middle-brow.  There is not one Beethoven or Brahms symphony here, and this is not the set for those who rely on Bruckner and Mahler for their daily sustenance.  There are established masterwork staples, such as Bach's Suites for Solo Cello, Beethoven's 4th and 5th Piano Concertos, and the Brahms Violin Concerto.  Still, there's a lot of worthy off the beaten track music to be heard here, and good number of works that became popular thanks to these pioneering recordings.  Although Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker was a well-known ballet, this was the first recording of the complete score.  Often, the program concepts showed an imagination seldom seen on the big labels: Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit with Bachauer at the piano and Sir John Gielgud reciting the accompanying poems; Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture complete with cannons - de riguer today but which was seldom done at the time; music from the American Civil war, and good old Balalaika favorites.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about these performances except to note that most show an inspiration seldom heard on the big labels.  Although recorded under studio conditions, many sound like live performances caught on the fly.  In many ways, these are the kinds of performances we might have heard if advanced recording technology existed in the 78RPM era.<br /><br />The first two discs are in monaural sound - the best of its kind I've ever heard.  Some may quibble at the inclusion of mono recordings, but it's fitting since the Living Presence name was coined by a music critic who reviewed these early recordings.<br /><br />A short bonus disc featuring an interview with producer Wilma Cozart Fine and excerpts from various recordings is included.  The set, which features the original LP front covers, comes with a generous and informative booklet.  Given the amount of interest in this set, I am hopeful there will be a second set - and I will definitely buy it.those who rely on Bruckner and Mahler for their daily sustenance.

B005SJIP2S|4.0|I could not  give this less than 4 stars. It is nice to FINALLY have some live DRAMA ! I don't have a problem with Benoit's vocals at all. Especially in light of Trevor Horn's disasterous vocals on the classic YES material during the DRAMA tour. Not to say I would not prefer Jon Anderson be in the band... But Benoit is a fine. Oliver more than adequately fills in on keys (way better than Tony Kay on the YES WEST tours of the 80's, perhaps not quite as good as Igor Korichev(sp?) of the OPER YOUR EYES days and much better than the keyboardist on the MASTERWORKS tours). My biggest complaint is the pace of the songs... They are annoyingly slow! Not sure why ... Everyone still has their chops (especially Steve Howe! )... I listen to alot of live YES and I would rate this somewhere high in the middle ... Again, only because of the slow pace.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was more than I expected. It starts slow and the point of view at the beginning is not one that I particularly care for usually but for this it works. It sets the stage so to speak, and it is so riveting. I started the book yesterday and finished it early this morning. I could not put it down, the way Erin Morgenstern sets it up you feel as though you will miss one of the acts of the circus yourself if you put it down and so you are compelled to keep reading on and on. I wish there were a second book (there is not to my knowledge) even if there were though it would be almost impossible to carry on the story. After reading 'The Hunger Games' trilogy I felt as though I would not find a book as riveting for a while. So I perused the Kindle store looking amongst the most highly touted books until I came upon this one. I am beyond pleased. I would recommend this to a friend most certainly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just finished reading the book before the movie and now I am a total fan of the series.  About to start the next one ASAP.
B007AMMHSY|5.0|This movie is just brilliant.  Almodovar just captures emotion so beautifully.  It's just phenomenal how he can take such a taboo subject matter and make it so elegant & refined.
0307957934|4.0|i was surprised to read a lot of the 'meh' reviews for this book.  i thought it was a great story, well told, and fast-paced and very interesting and actually seems like it could be what the future might bring!  i remember seeing 2001: a space odyssey when it first came out and just being so totally freaked out with the big reveal that HAL could think on its own...well i really have to hand it to clarke, the author of 2001 - what an imagination he had to think about this happening before the advent of the internet!  but i digress  - anyhow, the fear index is a wonderful read and needs to be a movie!  the geneva setting is also interesting...
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Last night I watched another of my bargain-rack DVDs and this was \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Boy, I really scored on this one! It was a fine, fine movie and for under four dollars! I'm amazed that this didn't get a Best Picture Academy Award, it's that good. Okay, it was nominated for seven awards. Does  that tell you something?<br /><br />Well, what can I say? Five stars! Alas, this one already has over a thousand Amazon reviews and a lot of them are very well done! I'd just like to add a few of my impressions and suggest you read some of the very fine top reviews. The direction, the photography and sound and the flow of the story were all first rate. No question. The acting was excellent across the board and throughout the movie. I felt that I was in a very real and very menacing situation and these were real people. It wasn't an action movie or anything like that, but what action there was gripped your attention. No boredom here!<br /><br />The story involved Andy (Tim Robbins), who was wrongly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover and was given a double-life prison sentence. He ended up in the Shawshhank State Prison of Maine. There he met long-teerm resident \\"Red\\" (Morgan Freeman) and they very gradually developed a deep friendship over the next several decades. The movie documents their friendship and the brutality, meaninglessness and boredom of prison life. Some of the prisoners come off rather badly, as might be expected. The guards and prison administration fare much worse. The whole place is just a very slowly unfolding nightmare. Finally, after enduring decades of this depraved life, Andy manages a very clever escape. \\"Red\\" rejoins him on the outside deep in Mexico after he is paroled. It's the only bright spot in the movie and may put a few tears in your eyes.<br /><br />The plot was extremely well done and carried out with only one exception. The last ten minutes, after Andy had escaped prison, was glossed over to an extreme degree. It made no difference to the story, and I wouldn't suggest changing it. That little ending part of the movie just doesn't fit well with the preceding flow. In any case, Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary PetersonIt made no difference to the story, and I wouldn't suggest changing it.

0374532281|1.0|I really, really, really wanted to like this book. I'm a huge Eagles fan, love me some Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro, and my little cousins were extras in this movie so I was super excited to read this book. Also 4/5 Amazon stars? Readers can't be wrong, right?<br /><br />I sampled the first few chapters on my kindle and wasn't too intrigued but I figured it would get better so i bought it.<br /><br />Torture. That's the only word I can use to describe reading this book. I was annoyed with the characters, dialogue and plot line throughout the entire book. I finished it in two days only because I felt that since i paid for the book I had to finish it out of principle. I often found myself skipping pages because they were filled with useless dialogue.<br /><br />I was waiting for a mid-book climax or even semi-plot reveal and there was nothing, not until the last chapter did you find out all the questions that you had throughout the book (if you even had questions and didn't already guess the ending, which is also very probable).<br /><br />This is the ONE book that I hope the movie plot totally steers away from. They're going to need to beef this movie up A LOT. I don't see it being a huge hit, maybe an indie limited theater release.<br /><br />Disappointing :(
B007AMMHSY|4.0|I was not expecting the twists and turns to go the way they did in this often disturbing and always intriguing story of a surgeon and a woman who is not who you think she is.  He keeps her in his house as a captive, his housekeeper knows about it, and there is a history that is slowly revealed, letting you know what happened over the past six years and how they got to this place in their lives.<br /> This is not recommended for all viewers due to the sexual content, nudity, and bizarre subject matter.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Thank you soo much Rebecca for gifting me this book I extremely loved it.<br /><br />Sophia, Charles, Adrian, Mr Patrenko, Paloma, Mrs Franklin, Lauren, Ivory, Red (and he was just a little bird) wow it's amazing how I can remember names of characters on books yet I cannot memorize any from people I've seen for a while. Weird! Anyways when I started reading this book I was already imagining what was going to happen and how the book was going to end well now that I finished reading the book I can now say I was so off.<br /><br />I extremely enjoy this book and I will totally recommend it to people that love to read fantasy, romance, paranormal and anything that falls in the vampire category. Totally love that and if you like that I recommend this book to you!<br /><br />I don't want to give spoilers so ill try my hardest on not giving any spoilers out.<br /><br />Sophia is just a normal girl that lives in a small town called Belle Meadow where she is not excepted because she is a Wicca, the people in the town think she worships  the devil.  All because of  Mrs. Franklin's  accusations a crazy old church lady.<br /><br />Her life starts changing short after she goes to Club Flesh with her friend Ivory that's where she meets Charles and soon after a terrifying event she meets Adrian the reason why she had excepted to go to Club Flesh in the first place. She wanted hoped Adrian would have some info on how to get rid of the voices instead she gets introduced to a whole new world of crours (vampires), elementals, witches and much more.<br /><br /> I was never expecting the book to be about witches, I thought it was only about vampires, really got a surprise there. Was far better than I imagined it would be I really fell in love with the characters as related so much to Sophia. It was breathtaking every time Charles and Sophia where together. I can't say anything else with ought putting any spoilers I just loved how Rebecca Hamilton put all this book together I liked how everything from Ivory's life and everything from start to finish was connected even way before Sophia was born. Really really loved the book and I will be waiting for the next The Forever Girl  Sophia's Journey (Forever Girl Series #1)
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I'd like to start out by saying the blu-ray set was absolute perfection, both in the video quality and HBO's treatment of the story. But for those of you expecting to eventually get a fulfilling ending, you might be disappointed. I say that because of books 4 and 5 of the Ice and Fire series. Almost nothing important happens to move the story along in those two books and the plot stops cold. And take into account it took Mr. Martin 11 years to right about nothing happening and you understand why i'm worried about the future of this show and how it's dependent on the book series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|although written for a younger audience, the three books in this trilogy make up an excellent story. well thought out, exciting and captivating. You identify well with the characters as we see a bit of ourselves in each of them. The story is never dull and each chapter leaves you hungry for more. Read all three books in 4 days.... wish they didn't  end.

B000A7DVY0|5.0|I had originally purchased Big Lebowski coasters from like Blockbuster or something. But than my dog got a hold of them 1 by one and I was left with nothing! I mean those coasters really tied the room together man. So I went out and purchased this for the coasters, than traded the DVD for 3 white russians and a Creedence tape.
B004HMYNFK|5.0|If you're looking for a delightful book to read to take your mind off your problems, you've come to the right place. This is a fun read.<br /><br />The protagonist is a pragmatic, sharp-witted African woman who has carved out a place for herself in modern African life. Presented as a series of vignettes, her cases are commonplace enough to be believable, and the commonsense way she goes about solving them is typically female, as is the touch of empathy--not maudlin--that we see as she manipulates the outcomes.<br /><br />Meet Mma Ramotswe and enjoy a slice of Africa.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I got this adapter for a simple bread box media server I am running in my basement (CentOS 6.1) which lacks a serial port as well as with use on my laptop (Windows7). This is also where I have my networking equipment setup and needed to be able to console the Cisco 871 and Cisco 2900/3900 XL switches I have. This worked out of box with no issues, I honestly do not remember if I had to RPM the drivers on the Cent machine or had to use the installation disc which came with the adapter. Either way I was up and running within a few short minutes at most.<br /><br />Great product, I work in a collocation and we use this on some of our work machines which lack a serial port if something needs a quick configuring.
B000095K7A|5.0|great album and addition to my collection. The sound is high quality and the record arrived flawless and i enjoyed the covers on the b side. I hadnt heard them before. was sent promptly... Anyways great buy
0812992792|5.0|This is an outstanding novel -- one of the best and most original I've come across in a long time. North Korea is a fascinating place for a variety of reasons. But Johnson hits on a theme that anyone can easily identify with: What do you do when your entire reality depends on surviving in one big, paraniod insane asylum? If the Dear Leader is crazy, then it's only a matter of time before insanity and paranoia inflitrate every level of society. Think of it this way: Recall the silliest, stupidest, most ridiculous policy your employer ever came up with. A policy you had no choice but to smile and accept in order to keep getting your paycheck. Now magnify that out over a country as a whole -- and you're just beginning to see how crazy things will get in a hurry.<br />  This is fiction. But Johnson has done his research well: Many of the events and policies he brings to light are based in fact. Again, this is a fabulous book that brings to mind great works like \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Catch 22.\\" And I suspect that when North Korea finally comes unglued and falls apart, we'll be amazed to learn that as horrific as this book can be at times, it pales in comparison to the stories we'll learn from the poor people trapped in Stalinism's last bastion.
B000059MEL|5.0|one of the best albums of all time, arrived flawless and sounds great! makes a great must have addition to my record collection.
B00005JPSM|3.0|A slick mousse and an embarrassing take-off(plagarism?)of Mostly Martha, the delightful original. Buy a copy of MM and wait until No Reservations is on cable.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This was an excellent program--up to their established standard.  Three (3) members seen in previous videos were not present--Maev, Hayley, and the harpist.  Their attire, their singing, their musical selection, and their accompanying ensemble were all outstanding and enjoyable to watch.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Purchased for my iPhone 4s, this product is clear, stiff, and a bit hard to get on the phone. The plus to that is that it fits SNUG. No shifting inside the cover, buttons are open to touch - not covered and hard to push. I've never used TPU so I didn't know what to expect as far as texture but it's not rubbery like the silicone covers; it slides on just about any surface. There is an Amazon logo on the back that's pretty easy to see but it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Oh! And the screen protector is kind of adhesive (not the kind that would leave a residue) so it really sticks. It's not meant to come on and off. It's nice though because it really becomes a part of the phone and you don't even notice it.<br /><br />I bought 2 cases and gave the other to the dog for a chew toy. All in all I love this one; just wish it was sticky like the silicone ones.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It seems like in many 'family' movies today there is at least one scene that makes you feel like you've just been assaulted by either foul language or inappropriate behaviour. Not this movie, it's clean, it's entertaining and the material is informing, inspiring and true. Learn this story and make sure your kids know it too.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a fantastic way to carry around the Bible, or even multiple versions of the Bible.  I like the calendar feature in the reading plans too.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|The concept of this film sounded interesting and entertaining, however, the foul language was such that I couldn't even watch the film. It was a waste of my time and money.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game was quite stupid, but it kept everyone entertained so i couldn't get my device back for a while but honestly it wasn't that great
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was stunning and very well thought out. It was set at a fast, steady pace. You will never forget Katniss Everdeen.
0879309210|5.0|If you are a novice with the technical aspects of the guitar, this book does an excellent job of significantly increasing your knowledge of guitar maintenance and repair.  It shows how to improve the finger board action and provides factory specifications.  One feature I really like about the book is the author provides detailed guitar information and specifications on guitar's from a number of big-name guitarist.  I used this book to greatly improve my guitar's tone and action.  All aspects of maintenance and repair are covered including electronics.  I highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game for passing time. Mentally challenging without causing great frustration. doesn't require sound, so safe to play anywhere without irrit&aacute;ting other people.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun minigames and lots of variety in the games I think they should give u more points for each game and they sometimes are very frusterating but most of the time they are fun to play and will last a long while
1612130283|5.0|I only bought it to see if the author actually knew anything about BDSM and would represent it accurately.  For the most part, kudos!  Really, a great job, either well-researched or known from experience.  I had a few minor complaints but overall, accurate and honest portrayal.  The only thing I don't love is that Christian has had a messed up past, insinuating everyone in the lifestyle has the same, which is just extremely inaccurate and borderline offensive.  But the beauty and honesty in the relationship between Christian and Ana is wonderful.  The book had me crying for Christian at the end.  Great read.
B002V091IO|5.0|this was a very moving book, particularly the ending...what a twist. Well worth a read and I really enjoyed it. it is definitely one I'd recommend
B004ZH66XO|1.0|this app refused to download and eventually when it did the game was nothing like described, I hate this app
B006E4QCXU|5.0|wow this app rocks! I got it and played it for an hour!<br />LOVE it. worth the pricey 1.99 cents. you should buy!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This book is easily the most self-contradicting piece I've ever read. The collaborative writing style was at best a terrible idea as the authors made no attempt to keep their message similar. Terrible fiction novel. Good for history's sake I suppose but nothing else.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  With the reading plans I have read the Bible more consistently than ever before.  It is so easy to use and I love all the different versions that it comes with.
1594744769|5.0|This book was so original and unexpected. Great for the price.  Pics were great additions to the story.  Can't wait for the story to continue....book 2?
B0050DZN4K|5.0|It has various catagory I can choose or customize as well. UI & layout of content are very welll done. I love to read all articles what I made.
B002BWP49C|2.0|I'm pretty bummed about this version, the special additions to this package do not include any extended scenes, outtakes, or deleted scenes.<br /><br />I don't think the promoters of the Twilight Saga truly understand the fans will buy the movie, on a simple disc with nothing else on it without marking it as Special Edition which insinuates there's something special, or different than the ordinary version?<br /><br />About the movie itself I give the MOVIE 5 *'s I think it's awesome. For those who hate it remember this is HALF the book. So we only got half the story it's a huge cliffhanger all that's missing is the ....to be continued at the end. Don't hate until you see the 2nd half.<br /><br />I'm for sure glad I preordered this at a discount, because had I paid full price I'd have been pretty peeved.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I recently pre-ordered and received Game of Thrones Season 1 on Blu-ray. I won't comment on the series because it is fantastic and many other reviews show those features. I will comment on the presentation and box set.<br /><br />The price was great at 35 dollars for Blu-ray for 10 hours of HD content. Compare that to a movie and you won't get the same deal. It comes in a very nice box that has a nice fold out for all the discs. The quality of the HD is great and a show like Game of Thrones benefits from the HD presentation. The sets are fantastic and it helps a viewer get immersed in the setting and characters.<br /><br />The menus are easy to navigate and each disc contains 2 episodes which is the right amount to watch in one setting. I usually don't marathon the series so two hours is a good block for me to view at a time. It has the usual wait time at the beginning of the discs can be tiresome.<br /><br />The actual box set is great. It looks solid and contains and map and character legacy. This makes it easy for new people to understand the characters and their place as it can be complex. My friend watched the first episode looked at the map and character ancestry and started to understand the world better.<br /><br />I hope everyone enjoys the series as much as I have. Read Song of Ice and Fire if you can't wait
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is &agrave; &ccedil;h&agrave;&ntilde;ge from from pl&aacute;ying solitaire.  can be a challenge. at times,but mostly pretend. easy.  I like. to play. when killing time
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My son is four.  He loves this toy.  He likes it more than my $100 hand-made aircraft models!  Siddeley is made of high-density plastic.<br /><br />Of course, it's durable and fun.  This toy can be handled with force, just don't throw it around and expect it to glide.  Though he doesn't actually fly (he rolls along the ground) he's not just to look at.  He has working missiles and he can be loaded with cargo from top-opening and rear-opening doors.  His face is awfully cute too!  And that wing with those smart winglets!  That's top quality aeronautical design in such a toy!<br /><br />Two things to make note of:  First, the tail assembly is a relatively weak snap-on type, and comes off easily.  Be ready to snap the tail back on for your little one at any given moment.  Also, the missiles are small, and easy to lose.  Either take them away directly, or make your child aware that they are easily lost.<br /><br />Here's something I would recommend to all boys and girls interested not just in the movie, but in flight generally.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i was attatched it the whole timw it just kept getting better and better i loved it great book u should red it
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love this! It's so much fun to play with, and it doubles as a pen. The sonic sounds are cool and I love the UV ink. I'm a kid at heart, but I don't think there's a Whovian out there that wouldn't enjoy having this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book it ws to so amazing i was attatched to it and i read it in 2 days
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This was a good follow up to the second book; it took me a little longer amount of time to inhale this book, it was a dry start but definitely got better as the chapters slipped by. New people made it interesting during slower times as well. Onto my 4th book.
0553278398|1.0|I am a huge Asimov fan.  The Foundation series is an amazing work, and I highly highly recommend it.  It is thought provoking and forward thinking, way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />While the series itself is well crafted and refined, this book is not.  This seemed like a publisher's attempt to squeeze more money out of the good name the series had built up.  As I read, I wondered if the book even hit the desk of an editor to trim the fat.  Unnecessary filler caused the plot to move at a glacial pace. The dialog between characters is worse than believable, no human speaks the way the characters in this book do.<br /><br />Please do not be offended by this review!  I encourage, nay demand that you read The Foundation Series! Just don't let this be your starting point!  Read the rest of the books and use this book as a supplement if you feel it necessary.  I don't think you will, the series is nourishing enough without this afterthought of a book.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was a good follow up to the first book; it took me a much shorter amount of time to inhale this book. I really loved how the characters I rooted for and hated in the first book developed even more, twists and turns of the plot had me thinking about this book when I was unable to read it...I immediately bough the third book once I finished.
B002NWOOXW|4.0|These movies are so enjoyable to watch. While this is not as good as the first one, it is still very cute and fun. I rather don't like the last bit of the movie in Thailand and jail, but the rest is sweet. Hopefully in fantasy land Bridget is finally enjoying life w/ her smashing Mr. Darcy!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  It was a current topic and well written.  I enjoyed the humor a lot.  If you are a fan of Nelson DeMille, you'll like this one.  I chose this book based on John Grisham's reputation and the subject matter.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I first attempted this book when it was first released and couldn't get into it.  Recently I listened to a book club podcast on the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and thought that 60 million people can't be so different to me, so read my free first chapter on my kindle and sure enough this time I was hooked from the very first page right until the last.  Now I have read the second book The Girl who played with Fire and am reading the third in the series, The Girl who kicked the Hornets Nest.  The author gives you a great feeling for the characters. Lizbeth Salander a very private, dark but intelligent ward of the state who does not conform in an way,  Mark Blomkvist a reporte and her employer and sometimes mentor who has integrity.  I thoroughly enjoyed the quick action that kept you guessing right to the end.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Please, let's just be honest for once. Independently of how many copies people have bought or will buy and how many grammies she won without deserving a single one of them, here are the simple truths about Adele:<br />- Most of the time she doesn't sing at all, she shouts. Anyway her voice is ordinary, if not poor.<br />- Her songs are mediocre, outdated, repetitive, indistinguishable and boring. 19 e 21 are exactly the same thing.<br />- Most people like her and buy her albums only because of her image. Adele's image helps her sell albums so much that she owes her image most of her success, even more than a typical popstar does.<br />- This is not classy music at all. So people who believe that they are musically cultured or expert only because they listen to Adele should just wake up from this huge illusion.<br />- It doesn't matter how many people worship her, she just remains one of the most overrated singers ever, and so does her music.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am a history buff and was interested in this book, 1, because it was Stephen King (always a good read) and 2, because I have always wondered, 'What if'. I was immediatly drawn into the story, wanting to know what was going to happen next and what was the ramification of choices made. This was such a fun read for me, that I read this long book in just 2 days. Well researched, and well written. Nuf said.
1934030198|5.0|I purchased this item for my son for his Birthday. He just loves the book; it contains information and advice that he has been searching for since he has become a participant in triathlons, etc.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Having heard all the hype surrounding the books and impending movie, I gave in and read this first book. It's well written, well paced, the charictors are sympathetic and easy to root for. It's also a little disturbing, pinning kids against each other to the death. Though not extremley graphic, I wouldn't read it to my grade schooler as it does have violence and a little gorey imagary. I can tell it was written for the teen and pre-teen, as there is (to me) alot of unnecessary kissing. Having said that, I did enjoy the book and will read the other two books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great Classic free game and usually a fun way to pass the time,  Could literally play it for hours .
0670022950|5.0|Pinter combines rigorous scholarship with quips from Woody Allen and the Marx Brothers and song lyrics from Bruce Springsteen and Edwin Starr to illustrate evolving human behaviors related to war, prejudice, religion, violence and sex. A challenging, lively and highly insightful read.  The book has made me optimistic about the human race.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This app does just what it says. Personally, I got bored with it very quickly. I'm glad I got it as faotd, because I would not pay for it. But if your'e excited after reading the description, go for it!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I bought this on the recommendation of family and friends, prodded on by the interesting trailers and overwhelming positive reviews. I have not read the books, so this review stands entirely on the quality of the blu-ray A/V, cinematography and the story as presented, without reference to canon or other benchmarks of \\"original storyline accuracy\\".<br />First off, the visual mastering appears to be exceptional. I would not rate myself as an expert audio/videophile but I do have a good A/V setup ( 1080p 50\\" panasonic and a decent but older 5-1 dts capable receiver ). I've read often enough that correct mastering is essential and not all blu-ray products are equal; you've probably seen some blu-rays that look only marginally better than DVD and, indeed, I've seen some upscaled 480p sources that actually look better than native 720/1080p sources.. it's all in the engineering effort, I guess. This blu-ray is frankly eye-popping ( the literal analog of which I fully expect to see at some point while watching this series.. to put it bluntly, it's not for the faint-hearted!). The source is native 16:9 which means the 1080p fills the entire screen without bars; whether this is the result of deliberate editing, or if it matches the original source, it looks fantastic. My better half, who doesn't usually care or comment on technical issues, commented on the clarity and quality of the image. The sound is just fine, but as noted, I don't have a very recent receiver so it just sounds like regular dts to me.<br />As for the story itself, when we got the package from Amazon, we popped in the first disk.. then the second; we watched 4 episodes in one sitting.. simply couldn't stop ourselves. We cut our cable some time ago so perhaps we are starved for really good shows but I haven't seen anything since Battlestar Galactica that crafts its characters with such finesse as this show. Sean Bean is simply brilliant and it's very easy to see how Peter Dinklage won an emmy for his performance. The gory scenes are just brutal, but not necessarily gratuitous.. they fit with the theme that that depicts a dark time in a dark and rough world... it's just special effects so it doesn't bother me, but if you are not fond of gore then be warned. There are many threads running through the story; multiple sub-plots and they all wind together very well without the jarring incongruity you often see from sloppy writing. Some shows run barely average sub-plots just to try to keep continuity but they are often patchy and lazy. No so here, the whole thing pulls together perfectly.<br />Anyways, I'm beginning to see my own subplots unravel so I'll wrap up with a basic recommendation: This is for you if you liked Lord of the Rings, enjoyed the edginess of Battlestar galactica, are fairly immune to special effect gore and are not offended by fairly raunchy adult theming. If you also like excellent character development, great plots, near-perfect presentation and have been waiting for a good, if not great, show to rise up above the awful landscape of mundane programming, then go for it. Great show, simply Great. Now I need to get back to watching it.. when is season 2 coming out?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game it definately offers a lot of different games and they are a lot of fun. the point system makes it possible to unlock even more games
B0042K4ZZK|5.0|I absolutely love this show. My wife and I only just discovered it and have watched the entire first season in a week. We are about to start on season 2 with a lot of anticipation. The storyline is extremely well written, suspenseful, exciting, sexy. It's just a great series. I hope it is around for many many years to come.
1421527618|5.0|This is a quick read, but don't confuse that with not being worth your time.<br /><br />This book is fast paced, well thought out, and a great sci-fi/action story.<br /><br />I know this has been said before but it is Groundhog's Day mashed with Solider.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story, and am interested to see how Tom Cruise will bring it to the big screen.

0545265355|3.0|- I was hooked on these books immediately as I started reading the first one. I thoroughly enjoyed that one and took one day off to think it through before starting the next book. The next book is brilliant as well, it's full of surprises and keeps you hanging on to every word - might I add, all of these books are incredibly exciting, in a way where you literally cannot put them down until you've finished reading them - but the third book was a big disappointment. I really like the overall theme of the third book, it's very exciting and all but then the absolute worst thing happened; the author rushed the ending. The last part of the book, maybe even the last half of it, felt so rushed I could barely be bothered to read it. This was a major deal breaker for me, and brings the overall rating of these books down, in my opinion. It felt like the last book wasn't in any way \\"symmetrical\\" to the two first books; the odd one out and not in a good way.<br />- Another thing that I found a bit annoying was the old \\"one girl, two boys, who will she choose?!\\" part of the trilogy. I enjoy reading young adult fiction to take my mind off things without having to focus massively on what I'm reading, but this stuff is just getting too old! Come on. I really found that annoying and unnecessary.<br />- Overall, I enjoyed reading the books, they are massively exciting and leads you into a new world that is very fascinating, but you can definitely tell that these are written for teenagers and young adults. And the last book ruined it for me. I will most like read them again, as I do with most books, but my immediate reaction after finishing the last book was disappointment.<br />- I highly recommend this trilogy to any teenager or young adult (or grown up) looking for a fascinating new universe to read about, books filled to the brim with suspense and an easy to read book series. I really love this series, it's an amazing world to enter!<br />- Another tiny downer was the font sizing problems I experienced reading them on my Kindle, and I've read that other's have had the same problems. That definitely needs to be fixed.<br />- ENJOY!
B004UID2LC|4.0|great app, good.way to get free music, the only problem i have sometimes is that fhe downloads dont always show up the firsttime so you mighht have to redownload the videos

B000002H8F|5.0|BOSSANOVA is another great album by the PIXIES...Many great songs, with a more polished sound...It´s still punk rock but with a softer feeling in musics like ANA, VELOURIA and IS SHE WEIRD...But like all the 4 PIXIES albuns, BOSSANOVA is a great rock piece!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app to play solitaire.  My son and I both like to play the game.  I would recommend it to others.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|COUNTERPARTS is the best RUSH album in a long time!!! I think is the best thing RUSH did since Moving Pictures...ANIMATE, ALIEN SHORE, CUT TO THE CHASE, COLD FIRE and the hit STICK IT OUT are great!
0307956350|5.0|This will be an unhelpful review, but in order to rate the book, I have to come up with 20 words!  I also read a lot of spy novels, and this one was terrific.  Lots of twists and turns.  If I could rate a 4.5, I would because a couple spots made a couple of the outcomes too obvious, but all in all, I look forward to more books by this author.  I would enjoy reading a sequel to this book with the same characters.
B000065PUE|5.0|Pixies really hits the world with DOOLITTLE...This is a great grunge raw surf punk rock album!!!One of the best of the late 80´s with classics like TAME, DEBASER, HERE COMES YOUR MAN, WAVE OF MUTILATION, MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN and GOUGE AWAY!!!!The PIXIES style highly inspired Kurt Cobain on NIRVANA and many other bands...A WEIRD MASTERPIECE!
0439023513|5.0|*MINOR SPOILERS*<br /><br />This book is my favorite of the series, hands-down.  Though I agree with some of the criticisms other reviewers have raised about the pacing, this is an incredibly brave novel and one that bring surprising depth to the series and the characters.<br /><br />The direction Collins takes with this book is different than the previous two.  Katniss and Peeta are, in different ways, shells of their former selves, while Gale's amorality threatens to drive a wedge between himself and Katniss.  Over the course of the novel, we are forced to issue with the issue of just war.  When is violence acceptable?  Is it possible to fight evil without becoming tainted?  Is it okay to use another human being to achieve a just end?<br /><br />While it seems that many fans wished for a rosier ending, I believe this ending is the most consistent with the world established by the series.  The deaths are jarring and happen without the literary equivalent of dramatic slow-motion; the violence is brutal and refreshingly un-sexy.  Katniss does eventually choose between Peeta and Gale, while cutting off contact with the one she does not choose, and she lives quietly outside of the public eye.  We are not privy to the exact details of life in the post-uprising Panem.  But this is exactly what we should expect from Katniss.  Her life at the end of the book is not perfect, but she is learning to love someone.  Readers who expect a fairy-tale romance perhaps lack experience in relationships.  Relationships take sacrifice and proceed through moments of doubt; bravo to Collins for letting young people see this instead of just letting her characters ride into the sunset.<br /><br />Likewise, it makes sense that Katniss does not participate in public life.  I believe the ultimate message of the book is this: violence can be justified, but those who use it are irreparably changed.  Katniss, and the other members of the revolution, have had to go to such extreme lengths to bringdown Snow and the Capitol that they are no longer capable of envisioning a just society; the right thing to do is to step aside, as Katniss does.  We see over and over again how contact with the Capitol taints the good intentions of the rebels, to the point where, at the end, the new government is considering re-starting the Hunger Games (but with a new set of victims).  Snow, and men like him, drag everyone down to their level.  The world seems better off for the efforts of the rebels, but still far from perfect.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see an author attempt such an honest portrayal of war.  So many forms of fiction, especially fantasy fiction, are eager to glorify the struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\"  Collins gives us ample reasons to hate the Capitol, but in \\"Mockingjay,\\" also forces us to question whether these simple moral categories even exist.  This is no small feat for any author, but is especially impressive in a work of fiction aimed at young adults.  Collins trusts that her readers are sophisticated enough to understand that this ending is perfect for the tone of the series.  It is too bad that many of her adult fans don't.<br /><br />If readers expect a depiction of violence on this scale to be entertaining and full of breathless romance, then Collins' thoughtful critique of violent entertainment has been completely lost on them.  This book is about flawed people, young and old, struggling to make difficult choices, and its ending gives us hope that these people can still get up in the morning and try to be good to one another.  This is no sugar pill, it's tough medicine; but one that all readers would be wise to take.

All the songs are amazing!!! it´s raw metal with some punk feeling!!!!ONE OF THE BEST FROM MEGADETH!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!WELL DONE, MEGADETH!!!!
B007HJ91HU|4.0|Look, we all know that typically originals are better than their remake counterparts.  I will say that I liked Willard in the original, but I love Willard in the remake.  The powers that be gave his character more lines and he's pretty adorable. Julianne Hough as Ariel was, in some respects better than the original Ariel too. And since I seem to be giving out complements - bravo as well to Uncle Wes (who was much more likeable than the original,) and new character Woody. Overall, if you like the original this was a well done remake that will entertain you for the duration of it's play time.
B0002EXH54|5.0|MEGADETH is one of the best METAL bands of ALL TIME!!!!! PEACE SELLS is one of MEGADETH[s best stuff...it[s their 2nd album, and still got the raw PUNK feeling of their debut KILLING IS MY BUSINESS(A CLASSIC!!!),but the band really mature their THRASH and create a MASTERPIECE!!!!! well, MEGADETH got some masterpieces through the years, but this one is just FANTASTIC METAL!!!!! i think Mustaine create his own thing on MEGADETH....a music where you can say is MEGADETH!!!!!

B001GQSY64|1.0|I consider this to be the MOST DISAPPOINTING INSTALLMENT in the Star Wars series.  Myself being an adult in my late 20s, saw this in the theater with an adult friend in his late 20s, naturally.  And I must say it was extremely awkward that we weren't actually 5 year olds there with our moms or dads.  THIS MOVIE IS AIMED AT SMALL CHILDEREN, with simple minds that have simple thoughts.  I'm sure some will argue with that, so as a straw-man argument I will mention their case about the new tag-a-long padawan assigned to Anakin.  She's targeted at 8 year old girls.  So there you have it.  If you are a 3 year old of either sex or an 8 year old girl buy this movie.  1/5 stars.<br /><br />ICING ON THE CAKE:  there is no grandiose musical, scrolling text scene at the begining of the movie!  totally falls out of line with how the other movies start.<br /><br />If you want to bridge the gap between Episode II and Episdoe III I suggest the Clone Wars cartoons that were aired on Cartoon Network between 2003 and 2006.  They are aimed more at adults as it was part of the adult swim line up for those years.<br /><br />-May the Force be with you...
B000002HAF|5.0|Doolittle may be the Pixies masterpiece with many hits, but Surfer Rosa is very good! All the songs are raw punk surf rock gems!!! BONE MACHINE, WHERE´S MY MIND, RIVER EUPHRATES, BROKEN FACE, BREAK MY BODY, VAMOS...Man, Surfer Rosa is really good!!!!
1936719118|5.0|I sat down to read this book and ended up reading it in one sitting (it't only about 80 pages in my Kindle).<br /><br />It is fun and inspiring. You won't be disappointed.<br />It will give you ideas on your own business.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|PRESTO got some nice songs like Chain Lightning, Show don´t tell and The Pass...The rest of the album shows a mix of previous albuns and what they will done in the early 90´s!
B004K4AVAG|2.0|I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS CD.<br /><br />THERE ARE SEVERAL AMAZING  SONGS ON THE DISC - BORN THIS WAY, YOU AND I, EDGE OF GLORY, HAIR, MARRY THE NIGHT AND JUDAS.  IF THOSE SONGS WERE RELEASED AS AN EP, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FITTING FOLLOWUP TO THE FAME CDS.  HOWEVER, THE DISC IS PACKED WITH FILLER SONGS THAT DRAG EVERYTHING DOWN TO A MEDIOCRE AND REDUNDANT BORE.  I EXPECTED MORE FROM MISS GAGA.<br /><br />I'M BEGINNING TO FEAR GAGA WILL NOT GO THE DISTANCE.  IS CELEBRITY APPRENTICE IN HER FUTURE?
B0002EXH5E|1.0|MEGADETH always will be one of my favorite bands...I think that from KILLING IS MY BUSINESS to YOUTHANASIA they create some of the best THRASH HEAVY METAL of all time...CRYPTIC WRITINGS got some great songs...but Risk......RISK is the most uninspired moment from this great band!!!! Why, Mustaine????? Besides INSOMNIA and maybe PRINCE OF DARKNESS, all the songs sucks!!!! even those 2 are not so good....some songs sound like POP ROCK, and all the album is really POP!???? sadly, this sad Risk is when MEGADETH really went wrong, and turn their fans away...after Risk, i really enjoyed SYSTEM HAS FAILED and ENDGAME...but stay away from this RISK of disliking a METAL ICON like MEGADETH!!!!
B006PKQQJS|4.0|I like this game. However it could be better. Sometimes it freezes, other times you have to click multiple times to make it work. other then a few glitches this is a pretty fun and very intriuging game. worth the money!!?!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!
1844487172|5.0|Even if I never get to make all the projects in this book it is still a great addition to my craft library. A book like this goes well with a cup of tea in the afternoon when I just want to daydream about making the beautiful projects.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A very useful app that has many possibilities in a home network with multiple computers (especially when useage is rationed for children).
0307888908|5.0|As someone who strongly believes in the power of social networks and approaching every day/task as a \\"work in progress,\\" I'm presumably like many others who have bought/read this book and enjoyed its premise, insights and well-organized approach. But well beyond the fact that this book is easy to read and masterful - both in the authors' extremely informed insights and their skilled packaging to make it easy for readers to concretely apply the authors' secrets to success - it is also intriguing to me that this book is one that applies so well to those of us living far outside the world of silicon valley startups. As a pediatrician and dedicated health communicator based in the midwest, I'm pretty sure I'm not the typical person who buys this book. But after reading it, I'm convinced that there are principles distilled in it that absolutely can be applied to everyone - even in my world of pediatrics, parenting, kids, teens, and child care! In the few days after reading this book, I've already had reason to recommend it to 5 people - none of whom are even remotely tied to silicon valley or the fascinating world that author Reid Hoffman is not only living in, but taking the lead in helping to envision, create and shape!  This book includes many useful tips I wholeheartedly believe in - not the least of which are to invest in an \\"interesting people fund\\" (i.e. be willing to invest in meeting new/interesting people), intelligent randomness (things really do happen for a reason, but we can all help facilitate if we make the right efforts), and to try and make time to read books - including those outside our typical genres/areas of typical relevance. That's what this book was for me, and the time I invested in reading it purely out of \\"random\\" interest proved VERY worthwhile.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|it crashed my kindle and i was not aloud to do anything on it after that i had to Find a way to re connect it
B004GYY714|3.0|lots of selections, but just not as easy to use as stitcher. also lacks of features. may be can borrow some from stitcher.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|... this album offers a welcomed respite. I found it uplifting, emotive, and heart wrenching. The predominantly romantic lyrics steered clear of most cliches, and showed off some really impressive poetry. I loved every track almost without exception. I just can't rave enough about the talent these guys possess. I highly recommend this album.
B005K17RU0|3.0|it is ok but not great. it cannot display more than one city at the same time. weather channel is better on this regard. it does give more info.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|I could not wait for the arrival of a 4 CD collection of songs by different artists celebrating the genius of Bob Dylan! The delivery was uneventful, arrived in perfect condition. The music is a big letdown, though. Of all the musical brilliance of Mr.Zimmerman's catalogue, rare and mostly unknown songs are reproduced poorly by famous and not-so-well-known artists. I was terribly dissapointed by the whole project - some rare gems are hidden between drary renditions of Dylanesque tunes. Not worth the price!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to navigate, easy to switch versions ....I. would recommend to anyone no matter how technically challenged they feel they are.
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was first given to my daughter as a college freshman assignment. I picked up the book one day and didn't put it down. The life and death of Henrietta brought me from laughter to tears. Her family wants to know every detail of Henrietta's illness. The cells physician's removed from her during her cervical cancer battle are well known throughout medical science. HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) cells have helped researchers discover the polio vaccine and many more medical miracles. A wonderful read. Over too quickly.
1569242739|5.0|The cupcakes in this book are the BEST I have ever tasted.  I will not be able to eat the grocery store bakery ones anymore.  I am not a vegan but all the cupcakes I have tried have so much flavor and are so good I don't care if they are vegan.  All have been husband approved.
B0060Q962Q|2.0|It was very fun at first. But when you when it feels like th A.I. let you win. also the A.I. will freeze and not do anything. i noticed this would occur almost every third round of one game. Seems like a minor bug to fix. also no easy med or hard mode. maybe do that cause sometimes as i said its too easy cause comp will just give it to your.  but pther times its hard which is fun.. fic the complqints above and ill rate higher.
B0071UG9XO|3.0|Rating: 3.875* of five<br /><br />The Book Report: Sixteen short stories about adolescent life in upper middle class America. The author hailing from there, he's written about Palo Alto, California. It could as easily be Cedar Park, Texas, or Rockville Centre, New York. The stories are very much in the vein of adolescence itself, working the same nerve in me as adolescents do: Getting drunk, getting high, hooking up, wondering if you're the only one, being ostracized, being Too Cool for School, realizing you're filled with rage but not knowing why or what you're raging against.<br /><br />My Review: I hear people say their high school or college years were so great, so amazing, The Best Years of My Life, and I think, \\"What planet are YOU from?\\" I hated adolescence, and I still do. Clearasil and hormones and emotional devastation. Ugh, no thanks, I been there and feel lucky to have escaped at all, though certainly scathed.<br /><br />So why read this collection of explicitly adolescence-themed stories? Because James Franco is an artist whose work I find really compelling. If you haven't watched 127 Hours, do. This man isn't just another pretty face, he's got what the Finns call sisu. (Google it, the explanation would take too much space in a short review.) The Academy Awards show he couldn't pull off, but movies yes, and writing yes.<br /><br />His writing is very good. It's not tricky, or show-offy, or self-conscious. It's direct and it's clear and it's nuanced. He uses words the way cops use fingerprint powder, to show you the shape of his ideas without getting you all greasy with hand-sweat and forehead blood. Make no mistake, it's not easy getting words down to this level of fineness, it takes mental grinding and grinding and grinding until there isn't a lump or a clot or a chunk to be seen. Silky, smooth, sensually exciting as it flows past you to take coherent shape in front of you: Stories, people, goddamned annoying kids formed of smoke and ash and powder, living in flashes of lightning--your attention please, there is something interesting happening over here, and if we're lucky, this thirtysomething writer will give us more. Soon.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is really awesome I love it a lot. it is challenging but fun at same time
B000FVQLQQ|3.0|I remember the 50's and I know Cambridge. People didn't act that way. Rude, crude people were not admitted into polite society. (That's what made it so polite.) No man, not even a crazy one, would marry a whore. Pizza was still unheard of. Why were there girls in an MIT classroom?? How did those people pay the rent when he didn't work? And what the heck is \\"overtime?\\" I had understood that this was based on a true story, so I was disappointed that it was so unrealistic. Then at the end I began to understand that it is (loosely) based on someone's life. Hollywood has done it again: taken an apparently true story and made it \\"relevant.\\" Perhaps we should call it \\"Hollowwood,\\" since they seem to want to hollow out everything they touch. There's a second disk, but I'm not going to bother with it.
B005F6NA56|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first as I haven't bought a CD for years.  The price was really cheap so I thought maybe it would be a knock off or defective.  As far as I can tell it is authentic and it works just fine.<br />It felt good to actually buy a CD again too!
0307595579|5.0|Well- this isn't so much a review, as a FYI to other people seeking to save some money. I Just bought this set for $29.99 on Groupon. Expires March 12, 2012.  Glad I waited to buy this- I'm looking forward to holding this cloth bound book in my hand.<br /><br />Just wanted to update this: Received the books, and wow- its beautiful. Modern design with classic book binding. Foil pint on the black glossy box. Only down side- box is not flush on top, and led to some minor damage during shipment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games keep you entertained for a while, but I wish it had more levels for each game.  It was mostly fun, though.
B005K17RU0|4.0|so far I really like this app. it appears to work well on the HTC EVO shift. I am using to track weather in 3 different areas and it works nicely. thanks
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I love Tina Fey and think she is so funny so I was very excited when I heard she was coming out with a book.  I rarely buy books right when they come out but I did with this one.  I was expecting to be laughing the whole way through and I maybe chuckled a few times.  I was mostly just bored with it.  I wanted to just give up on it a few times but thought it had to get better.  Sadly it didn't and I felt like I wasted my money on it.
1904994768|5.0|Great book!! Contents are very well made. Wide variety of games and records. Full color pages contain wonderful photos. My son is featured also. :)
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus was magical in so many ways, so I almost hate giving it only three stars. If I could break the rating into parts, I'd give it two stars for the first half (or more), four stars where it starts to pick up, and possibly up to five stars when it all comes together at the end.<br />The problem, for me, was that there were so many characters to keep track of along the way, and so many scenes I kept doubting were even possibly relevant. The list of those two things grew at such an alarming rate I nearly gave up.<br />The writing is beautiful, elegant, and amazing - hands down. But the slow pace of the story was simply too aggravating. Still, I would say worth the read.
B0000C8AV3|5.0|What a great album this is, superb songs (Sweetheart Like You, I and I, Neighbourhood Bully and more), some fantastic contributions from Mark Knopfler and excellent mastering on the SACD version. For me, it's my favourite Dylan album after Blood On The Tracks. It has a bluesy feel and Dylan's voice is in good form, enhanced yet further by Knopfler's atmospheric guitar work. Even for those not wholly enamoured with the great man's output, I can unreservedly recommend this album. Apologies for the spelling, I am a Brit.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|The tale is clearly over the top, being implausible and virtually impossible.  That said, the pace is relentless, the direction superb and one can do worse than watch two hours of Saoirse Ronan, whose acting and pure physical beauty mesmerize the viewer (well, the male one anyway).  Cate is a bit miscast but does well. Great cinema it isn't, but it will grab you and not let go.
B006546EPA|5.0|Just received this item yesterday.  I started listening to the contents and on the second cd #18, found a defective disc.  I have 30 days to get this resolved.  Make sure you start listening to the discs asap so if you have problems you can get them resolved.  This is the 7th BC box in this series I have purchased and so there may be other discs I have not found yet.  Otherwise, the Kempe recordings are excellent.  The operas (6) are conducted by von Karajan, Bohme, Sinopoli.  The Kempe and the Operas clearly cover the cost of this box.  There are items I never would have heard had it not been for the box, however, I have concerns about whether there are a lot of defects in this box.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Before the Springsteen purists start screaming at me, let me explain. Bruce has created numerous spectacular studio albums. But any fan who has seen him live knows that there is a dimension of his music that must be seen live before you can say you have really experienced what the whole phenomena is all about. And it is more than just the music. Bruce is one of those rare performers who creates a symbiotic relationship with his audience when he plays. There is real emotion going on there. From the stage all the way to the cheap seats and from the audience to the band. It is an intimate experience even with thousands of people in the house.<br />  Before Bruce disbanded the band in the 80's (for a long almost decade long break-up) the band was at it's zenith. Born In The USA was one of the biggest selling rock albums of all time and the band was doing sold out stadium shows. But the band did not have all the pieces in place all the time. Stevie Van Zandt went off on his own for a while and Nils Lofrgren and Patty Scalfa were not yet permanent members of the band. Flash forward to this album taken from the closing 10 night stand at Madison Square Garden in 2000 (and shown in part on an HBO special). The whole band is together now. Plus the great Nils Lofgren and Patty Scalfa are playing as well. Bruce obviously is older and more mature as are all of the E-Street Band. And this time there is no uncertainty and no doubts  in their relationship. They know who they are and what they have and they are not ever letting go of that. They have come back together and while you might not feel the kind of intensity you sensed in their younger days, this time you feel something even more dramatic and grander. The band is absolutely thunderous and emotional. The setting of Madison Square Garden is perfect. I don't know what it is about that place, but some of the greatest performances in rock and roll happen in that building. Trust me I have been there dozens of times for many different acts including one of the shows during this stand. This album represents the best performances that are available commercially of how this band sounded when all the pieces of the puzzle were put together (with all due respect to the Live 1975-1985 recording which is a wonderful album, this is better).  And with the heartbreaking losses of Danny Federici and of course Clarence Clemons unfortunately that will remain the case.<br />  As for the music: WOW. Check out the haunting version of \\"The River\\". The spiritual \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\". The joy of \\"Out In The Streets\\". The biographical \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\" with the wonderful introductions of the band. And feel the emotion in \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" where the true closeness and commitment of the whole band is heartfelt and expressed. There are many other goodies here and the audio quality of this recording is top notch. I have heard the criticism that this album doesn't contain enough of the bands biggest hits. Maybe so, but hits were not really the true measure of this wonderful artist and this spectacular band. And finally remember this; Bruce Springsteen alone is certainly a bigger star than any or all of the members of the E-Street Band members either solo or as a unit. But \\"Bruce Springsteen and The E-Street Band\\" is so much better than he could ever be on his own. He knows that now. This album celebrates that relationship.
1612130283|1.0|Would love to read this book, but for this price!? Are you kidding me! I guess I will have to pass.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I enjoyed this book. Exercise and diet books are a hobby of mine, but if I am being honest I start more than I finish. This one was great.<br /><br />It was easy to read, chapters were well constructed and easy to find what sections interested you. I loved that he used his own body to actually try the information in his book. He doesnt dumb down the science or just illude to it happening behind the scenes. I want to know why something works or doesnt, I dont want to take the authors word for it- I like that Tim Ferriss give you that. Some of what he says isnt going to work for me obviously as genetics and gender do play a role is what is effective for a person.<br /><br />Interestingly enough- I tried the diet he recommends in the book. I added beans/legumes to at least one meal a day, more if I was able. I cut out breads and \\"white\\" foods. I did lose nearly 10 pounds before I hit the brick wall. My brick wall? I discovered that I am actually gluten intolerant and lactose intolerant. I started reacting to foods that I had never had a problem with. Random food started to give me stomache aches, nausea and headaches. Symptoms that I had misinterpreted for years as other issues started to coincide with eating gluten/lactose filled foods. Since going gluten-free my sleeping issues and dehydration issues have cleared up, I dont sweat constantly, and I dont have to drink 3 or more liters in a day to avoid back or joint pain/cramps/digestive issues. I have gained the ability to 'suck in my gut' again, water retension is down, my hair has started to grow at a faster rate again, and the weightloss has restarted without having to struggle for each pound.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this games its so awesome. its so addictive once you start you will not ne able to stop.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Here's what  you get when you fork out 100 for this boxed set of CDs.<br /><br />You get some of the most amazing performances of classical music, pop showpieces, and what would today be referred to as classical crossover collections, ever available to the public.  What makes these Mercury Living Presence Recordings such an amazing and essential addition to your classical music collection? If you already own a few of these on CD, LP,  or SACD or newly issued flac files available for download on other sites on the internet, you already understand that new isn't necessarily better, digital recordings of mediocre performances and tired performances may sometimes offer sonic perfection without the sheer energy or exuberance of a premier performance or recording.  I have to admit,  longtime collector of classical music, there are works and performances in this box I would have never purchased as separate CDs, but as part of this collection...I am discovering music I have never heard before, and for the life of me, am wondering how some of these works could have escaped me.<br /><br />Now that some other eager reviewers have listed the contents and posted their gripes, one or two of them well founded, let me actually try to review this set and convince you, it is one of the most valuable treasures of classical music you'll ever get your hands on.  At just about 2 dollar per disc, this isn't another Brilliant Classics set of hits and misses, or a survey of a single artist's recordings for one label.  There are many performers here, not only at the dawn of stereo, but recordings in an era of discovery and optimism...sparkling analog recordings produced under the pioneering vision and genius of Wilma Cozart Fine, with Harold Lawrence, her husband C. Robert Fine, and the entire team of Mercury engineers.<br /><br />The Modern Classics - and back in the fifties and early sixties - that meant groundbreaking, new, fresh and exciting.  And Eastern European.  This was a time when the Soviet Union was still behind the Iron Curtain.  Important consideration for two reasons. Mercury seemed to have a fascination with twentieth century Eastern European and Russian composers, and many of the musicians and conductors in US and European orchestras were refugees from Communist block regimes.  The good news for us is about 16 CDs in this set are recordings - some of them premier - of modern classics.  The Anglo-Saxons get three of the 16 modern CDs.  Plenty of Bartok, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, and Stravinsky with a touch of Aram Khachaturian (got to love that Sabre Dance).  Most of these works are performed by the Minneapolis Symphony or the London Symphony conducted by Antal Dorati.  The first two recordings in the set are monaural, performed by the Chicago Symphony and under Rafael Kubelik.<br /><br />I especially liked the Yehudi Menuhin/Dorati/Minneapolis Symphony recording of  Bartok: Violin Concerto No. 2: Intimate, brilliantly emotional without being effusive, warm and chilling at the same time - orchestra never overpowers the soloist.  Closely miked but still enough apparent distance to evoke that concert hall sound.  You can't get enough passive distance from this performance to not be fully engaged in the experience of the piece.  The Andante Tranquillo movement will leave you breathless.<br /><br />Copland's Appalachian Spring on this set is also a gem. I really didn't think there was a version out there that could come close to Bernstein's recording for Columbia Masterworks with the New York Philharmonic.  Dorati had been a naturalized US citizen for about 14 years when this piece was recorded, and I don't know what his association may have been with the composer, but he captures the spirit of the piece - rips the zeitgeist right of the freaking air.  For all the charm and wit of Zinman's recording with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, for performance and engineering...this may be the definitive version of this work.<br /><br />Khachaturian: Gayane - Ballet Suite:  A finer recording of anything classical, you'll never find it.  At least in the concert piece realm.  Don't know how the producers and engineers did it, but this performance and the acoustics are perfectly matched to give you lush strings, percussion that knocks the breath out of you, and you can't sit still throughout the entire suite.  None of the atonal, modern sounding composition here.  Sweet melodies, more closely tied to the 19th century romantics.  One of the most fun pieces in the set.<br /><br />The Standard Works - Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Liszt., Bach.<br /><br />Flash.  Glitz. And Ear Candy.  There are 5 discs that cover the Baroque Period, and this clearly was the Achilles Heel of the series.  Janos Starker does a fine job on the Bach Cello Suites, but after hearing his performances you get why the public went gaga over Jacqueline DuPre and Yo Yo Ma.  The set of Pepe Rodrigo destroying Vivaldi could snap you out of a severe depressive episode.  Don't recommend while eating a hot dog.  However, the recordings of classical and romantic period works are consistently remarkable recordings.  Mercury LP had a way of recording a grand piano that made the high notes, especially ones under heavy attack, simply sparkle.  Again, engineering magic.<br /><br />Gina Bachauer's Brahms Concerto 2 under Stanislaw Skrowaczewski with the London Symphony Orchestra is jaw-dropping magnificent.  Paul Paray's Symphonie Fantastique is another of this set's highlights.  It is difficult for someone like me to sit with these recordings and realize that before Solti and Karajan, before  Uchida and Barenboim - there was at least one generation of conductors, ensembles and soloists, captured in magnificent stereo, and just as much sound quality and magic.<br /><br />To say these recordings sound just as good as digital would be missing the point.  Different medium, different techniques that in many cases far surpass anything digital has ever produced.  And the artists.  Getting more than just of little of their spirit and soul captured accurately on these recordings.  Bachauer played 630 concerts for allied troops, and still had time to feed stray cats around her home in Greece.  You could write a book and a screenplay about Dorati, writer, painter...and the Philharmonia Hungarica.  These recordings prove that Detroit could out bombast the Chicago Symphony at some point in their history.<br /><br />The Classical Crossover Recordings.  With an Eisenhower Era Sensibility.<br /><br />Sousa marches.  Balalaika music, with orchestra.  Civil War songs.  And Pepe Rodriguez.  If you can't take these recordings seriously, you can use them to snap you out of a bad mood coming from or going to work.  Superb performances and recordings packaged for people who enjoyed the Mitch Miller Show, and who probably faithfully tuned in for the Lawrence Welk show every week.<br /><br />Summary:  All in all, these are a combination of showpieces, concertos, and modern classics with a pop marketing slant towards record buyers of the late fifties and early sixties.  What makes them stand out is the freshness, the excitement, and commitment to quality.  The TLC. There weren't 8000 versions of these works on the market when these were released.  You're not just getting a set of discs here.  You're getting a legacy from a generation of engineers and musicians who didn't take their artistic freedom, their audiences, or their passion for these works for granted.  Highly recommend.n: Gayane - Ballet Suite:  A finer recording of anything classical, you'll never find it.  At least in the concert piece realm.

With an Eisenhower Era Sensibility.<br /><br />Sousa marches.  Balalaika music, with orchestra.  Civil War songs.  And Pepe Rodriguez.  If you can't take these recordings seriously, you can use them to snap you out of a bad mood coming from or going to work.  Superb performances and recordings packaged for people who enjoyed the Mitch Miller Show, and who probably faithfully tuned in for the Lawrence Welk show every week.<br /><br />Summary:  All in all, these are a combination of showpieces, concertos, and modern classics with a pop marketing slant towards record buyers of the late fifties and early sixties.  What makes them stand out is the freshness, the excitement, and commitment to quality.  The TLC. There weren't 8000 versions of these works on the market when these were released.  You're not just getting a set of discs here.  You're getting a legacy from a generation of engineers and musicians who didn't take their artistic freedom, their audiences, or their passion for these works for granted.  Highly recommend.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I don't understand all the 5 star reviews! it takes 3 hours real time just to make a grilled cheese. how is this fun? it should be called waiting story.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|I just finished reading this book, and Sam makes a compelling argument against free will.  As with any book arguing a controversial topic, there are parts with which I do not completely agree, but that does not detract from my enjoyment of this book.  Letter to a Christian Nation and The End of Faith are stronger works of his.  If you haven't read them yet, I think they are a good place to start.  After reading those, then you should move on to this one.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an overall decent app.  the games are short and simple and, for the most part, fun.  however, a lot of the games are extremely similar.
1451673442|5.0|The other book \\"The Power\\" was far more brilliant... maybe because i listed to the Audio version... We want an extended audio edited for the Magic. Please Rhonda and i wish you the best... Thank You for your amazing work so far....
0307594009|5.0|After being baptized by certain misguided Mormons for, I believe, the ninth time, I decided to re-read Anne Frank's diary.  I read it last in my late teens.<br /><br />When I read it as a teen, I had no problem believing a teenager could write material that contains such perspicuity.  As an adult, I find it difficult to believe.  And hence, we see the gulf between children's self-understanding, and the adult's perception of that understanding.  In the 25 plus years since I have read the diary, I have assumed the rigid attitude and stultifying thought patterns of an adult.  One of these side products is to believe that a girl at fourteen can't write anything substantial about herself and her world.  What a sad commentary on the maturation of the human mind.<br /><br />On a technical level, I find it fascinating to learn that the diaries were a very conscious effort on Anne Frank's part to create a published book.  The conception that the diary was found, complete from beginning to end, is wrong.  She wrote the diaries almost as an epistolary memoir.  She went back and revised passages.  The work we have in our hands when we read it is a composite of sorts.  An original diary, its revision, and a combination of the two, edited by her father, Otto Frank.  This is all expressed in fascinating detail in Francine Prose's  Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife.  I highly recommend this book as a companion piece to any re-reading of Anne Frank's work.
1451683405|5.0|I thought this was a fascinating work, which brought to my attention something that I previously had not given much thought: the idea of free will. Although the idea that humans do not have free will seems, on its face, to be obviously incorrect, Harris does a very succinct job of explaining exactly what aspects of what we call \\"free will\\" either do not exist or are acted upon by other influences.<br /><br />\\"We might know what we want, but we do not know why we want it.\\"<br /><br />I think I'd have to re-read this, or order the audio book, because I feel like I'm only barely grasping the concept. The idea is so unusual and thought provoking that you want to have full control of your understanding before recommending it to friends and family, otherwise you won't do this work justice.<br /><br />Thanks to Sam Harris for another interesting read.
B002WJI63A|5.0|I collect plush video game characters.  This was one of the first ones I ever got, since Princess Peach is my favorite Mario character.  She's soft, durable and made out of great material.  Not long after I got her, I posted a picture of her on Facebook and one of my friends wanted to know where I got her.  I gave her the link and so you may have a new customer!  This doll is nice and easy to play with, and she looks good too!  Perfect for people like me who love Peach!
B005XOPEOU|1.0|This album is incredibly badly mixed for year 2012. Almost impossible to listen on anything other than the cheapest Walmart boombox. No matter how good the material is (which in fact is not their best), the sound engineering just killed it.

B004LWZW8I|5.0|Great cinematography, great script, stunning special effects and CGI! Money well spent. Great entertainment for all. However, I thought the sex scene was a little extreme and unnecessary, but that's just me. Anyhow...I can't wait for the sequel!  Job well done! My hats off to the producers!
B004XIZN5M|3.0|Paul Wade, like most of Dragon Door Publishing's authors, cuts through the fluff right to the content: brief background of his experiences, quick overview of calisthenics as a strength regimen, very short *get psyched* chapter, followed by the Big Six moves and their progressions.<br /><br />While the exercise descriptions are brilliantly detailed and most of the photos top-notch, in terms of shot angle, demonstration of move, and clarity, the book doesn't present the rounded approach of most training volumes.<br /><br />Through its exclusive focus on calisthenics, Convict Conditioning (CC) does a solid job of presenting six wonderfully difficult master exercises with clarity. It does not, however, provide a truly structured program for progression (essentially: do this move whenever you workout until you can do **this many** then move on), does not select Progression Standard reps based on any expressed logic, and does not provide any specific means for testing or challenging strength.<br /><br />Also, the variants sections could use more pictures for clarity.<br /><br />Probably the biggest shortcoming of the writing in CC, as the exercises themselves are quality and the descriptions are useful, is Wade's blatant disregard for those tough guys who DO use equipment--as a supplement to their training. He blurts a few paragraphs at the very end of the book about adding some dumbbells or kettlebells if you want some challenge. Thing is, as a guy who IS into calisthenics, and has been for a while, as a guy who can perform lots--but not all--of the moves in CC, and as a guy who DOES like to use kettlebell snatches/swings for conditioning, kettlebells or barbells to train the occasional O-lift, or farmer's walk heavy weights for extra oblique work, I felt completely disrespected.<br /><br />I am a personal trainer and have had a lot of success with fat loss clients through strength training, and primarily I stick to bodyweight exercises with them. Sometimes, though, a little equipment, used appropriately, can help them tap into essential kinesthetic awareness. Wade's CC ignores the virtues of appropriate equipment, even while praising old-school strongmen who ALSO trained with external weights (Sandow, as a fine example).<br /><br />Short version: CC has good stuff if you want step-by-step guidance to some high level gymnastic movements and are interested in moving away from the gym scene; it has a lot of room to grow in terms of acknowledging other training modalities and presenting its information with a scientific structure.ttle equipment, used appropriately, can help them tap into essential kinesthetic awareness.

B000000H3Z|5.0|This is the 3rd album I've bought by Sepultura and it definitely is the most \\"metal\\" in it's purest form. It's got blistering solos, inventive guitar lines and riffs, the drums are absolutely brutal/brilliant and Max Cavalera's vocals match the whole vibe perfectly.<br /><br />My first album with Sepultura was \\"Roots\\" and that blew me away and it seems like the further I go into their past, the more intense they were. I was literally thinking \\"wow!\\" some of the time listening to \\"Beneath the Remains\\".<br /><br />In my opinion, it still stands the test of time. You can tell it was recorded in the 80's but it's sheer intensity transcends generations. The bonus tracks that were thrown on for the re-mastering of this are alright.<br /><br />The album traditionally ends on song 9, so Track 10 sounds like an outtake that the band decided to scrap with sound quality that isn't as good as the remastered album. Tracks 11 and 12 are called \\"drum tracks\\" and they pull the drums and bass to the center so you get to hear how truly impressive the band's drummer is but I think it's already clear on the original songs how good Igor is.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a metal-head that loves the hardcore/thrash music that has speedy solos, this will make you jump for joy.<br /><br />Even if that doesn't sum you up, this album is pretty impressive in general (as is this band), so you might want to take a listen to a couple of their songs to see what you think.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|Pavel Tsatsouline does nice work here presenting his ever-evolving RKC-issue hardstyle kettlebell training. The technique cues are solid and the stories of Soviet strongmen are entertaining. Even if you've been playing with kettlebells a while, as I had, you will pick up some knowledge from this volume.<br /><br />The exercises are kept so few, the words so curt, and the program so simple that a reader is tempted to think he isn't getting value from the work. But then, that reader should pick up a kettlebell and start working. Thought crushed.<br /><br />Admittedly, a few notes about incorporating kettlebells into a more comprehensive strength program could stand to be included, but as a guy who almost exclusively trains with bodyweight and kettlebells, you really don't need that. I would, however, like to see some windmills or pistol squats, even if just in pictures, with some form cues: buying Return of the Kettlebell when even Pavel says it has been transcended by EtK seems wasteful.<br /><br />Short version: If you want to get strong with kettlebells, want to improve your cueing and teaching of hardstyle techniques, or just want to expand your collection of great training volumes (RKC Program Minimum will get you going!), EtK is the book for you. If you want an integrated program, hand holding, or any illusion of coddling, cutesy \\"bodybuilding\\" programs, get far, far away. EtK is about strength and power, kettlebell style.<br /><br />If you don't think so, go for a 5 or 10 min snatch test at 24kg. Then get back to reading.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the numerous versions I can choose from.<br />I just wish it was available off line. but well worth time studying. Gods Word.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a game that both I and my 4 year old enjoy. I am usually not into games, but after I started playing I couldnt put it down.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have had this app for about a year and loved it! Never had any problems on my samsung mesmerize. I updated the software on my phone and had to reinstall this app and now it freezes everytime I pick up a sun or plant anything. I'm disappointed also because I lost all my data when I had to reinstall. I had beaten the game and now i'm trying to start over and cant play more than 2 minutes without wanting to throw my phone out the window. Please fix this!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty entertaining. some of the game are pretty challenging. my only gripe about this game is how much the later games cost. other than that, really fun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my favorite app!!  I have it on my Kindle abbe cell phone!!  Having the word at my finger tips at all times - absolutely priceless!!  The plans that are available have been helping me grow in God's wisdom and knowledge.  Some of them I have gone through several times so that the Word becomes rooted within me!!  Highly recommend this to everyone, no matter what your religious teachings are, there is a version of the Bible for you.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is like a simpler warioware, but with slightly better graphics. There are ads, but are not necessarily in the way.
0312430000|3.0|The importance of checklists are not revolutionary.  They are however a most effective method of success in any activity.  This book reinforces this idea.  The story style of the book was not my cup of tea but once I got used to it I relaxed with it and started to enjoy reading about what surgeons get up to.  You have got to love pilots however.
B0042JTAI8|5.0|Yet another great book ! I have read the other two books and this one follows on in the same theme as the others, moving from the present to the past with a mystical aura overlaying the whole story! A very satisfying read ! can't wait for the next one !

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|...it won't look good for long doing it.<br />I've been using this for a few months now, and there are no scratches on the screen, which is the only reason I gave this two stars.<br /><br />The elastic is now very lose and has a hard time keeping the live hinge in place when the fire is propped up .  It now constantly slips out of the \\"propped\\" position, with or without the elastic band, and falls over during normal use.  This is no danger to the Fire, but it sure is a PITA. The portion of the cover that actually comes into contact with the screen is a hair and fur magnet - I have three cats and I'm constantly cleaning the inside of this cover.<br /><br />Worse, the non slip material is coming off all over the cover.  The cover looks like it's been in a war, when it's just been in my bag. I carried the KF without ANY cover in my bag for a month before i got this cover and the material on the back of the fire does not have so much as a scratch on it.  The cover looks so bad, I've been asked not to bring it to customer meetings because it makes it look like I don't take care for it.  There is NO way this is a $30 product.  If this were a $10 product, maybe.  I am VERY disappointed in the quality of the materials.<br /><br />I stress again, however, it HAS protected the Fire. But since I now have to replace it just to be allowed to carry it to a customer meeting, it's now useless.  I don't like leaving bad reviews - somebody worked to design and make this.  I get that.  But the materials chosen for this just aren't up to snuff.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/12/2012:  My bad, I did not read the product description closely enough, this has a warranty that the good folks at Marware contacted me about right after my initial post.  They are sending me another cover, which I will test out.  Apparently, some of these shipped with the wrong coating (?) and I got one such.  I've added a star for the service.  If the new cover holds up, I may just add another. Service is why you pay $30 for >$10 worth of plastic :)  If nothing else, I feel better about the purchase knowing that someone is backing up the product.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/5/2012: I have changed my rating to 5 stars because the replacement cover has held up a treat.  I have treated it exactly the same as the original that got so banged up - and this one remains flawless.  I went on a cruise and a family that sat next to me at lunch had two fires, each with this cover.  One was flawless, the other banged up.  I told them to contact Marware, because they'd done me a real solid with this replacement.  Couldn't be happier now.  Thanks a ton!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you haven't watched this show you are truly missing out on, in my opinion, the best tv show ever made. It has every element that makes a show great; love, lust, greed, epic drama, battles, and so much more. So many great actors are in this show. The story is hard to keep up with in the first few episodes because of the many lands and families involved, but it is well worth the effort to keep watching and start putting everything together. I won't go into the details because I always hate when I am reading a review and they give away the best parts.<br /><br />If you like fantasy, action, beautiful landscapes, epic drama with stellar acting then check out GOT. I have finished the first season on HBO and I am also reading the first book. I am halfway into the book and so far it is following the show exactly. There are a few minor differences like character ages and small details but so far the show is right on point. It may change as I get farther into the book. I plan on reading the entire series as I find the time.<br /><br />I am also so ready for the second season to start on HBO. During the first season they always ended each episode with a big event that leaves you in shock. I was lucky that I watched the show after the series had completed so I did a couple of days of do nothing but vegetate on the couch and watch GOT all day and night. I don't know how I will deal with the pressure of waiting a whole week between episodes during the second season. I am sure it will be torture, but I can't wait![[ASIN:B003Y5HWMW Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]]
1612130283|1.0|I just finished 50 Shades of Gray.  I read it in two days, so at least i didn't invest too much time in it, because if I had invested more time, I would not be happy!<br /><br />This book is seriously written on a 6th grade level (not that I would want a 6th grader writing it, just saying the level of writing).  It was very simplistic.<br /><br />The thing that annoyed me the most though was the repetitiveness of words and language.  I mean how many times  was \\"Oh my\\" used?  \\"Breath Hitched\\", \\"Holy Hell\\".  I mean come one!<br /><br />it was very predictable.  They see each other, they have sex.  That's about it.<br /><br />Pretty pathetic.<br /><br />There was no depth at all in to the psyche of Ana.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of games to unlock, mostly the type that don't make you think too much. Great time waster! There are a lot of ads, but I don't find them obnoxious.
B000001FSU|4.0|That's not saying much though. SOE is still good and enjoyable. They toned their sound down and it's less heavy and a lot lighter than Among the Living but still a decent follow-up. The songs are sslower and more melodic but it's still a metal album and it's definitely thrash. Out of Sight, Out of Mind is one of my favorite Anthrax songs. There's one thing that makes it a step down from ATL, it's the production. The songs are great and it's an album worth owning but it could use a remaster.

B006IDG2T6|3.0|Sam Harris is one of the most clear and sincere writers ever to grace my bookshelf.  These traits allow a clear view, and for this I am appreciative. Unfortunately, I cannot give this work more than three stars for one primary and one secondary reason.....<br /><br />The primary problem I have is that I think Dr Harris is partly under the sway of dualism, and his difficulties mostly arise from this. This is not fully true, for he  says  - \\"you are not controlling the storm, you are not lost in it. You ARE the storm\\". Which is correct. It is well understood that our awareness is only a fraction of what we are, our decisions and choices arise from much more than what we perceive ourselves to be. Sometimes our perceptions are flawed.<br /><br />However our awareness is all we know, which leads to the illusion of a \\"ghost in the machine\\" and make behavior often difficult to understand, especially our own.<br /><br />Most of Dr Harris's work is a refutation of the \\"free will\\" of the part of ourselves that we are aware of, our awareness itself. This is not controversial, as anyone who has seen a fight precipitated by an empty stomach or a full bladder will attest. Of course it viscerally feels otherwise. An insight of science is that everything that seems so is not necessarily so. More, by relegating these subconscious forces to a status remote from what we are, he disregards a fundamental insight of the neurosciences. To paraphrase Buckaroo Banzai \\"we are what we are\\".<br /><br />Dr Harris would have done well to listen more closely to Dr Dennett, and he at least puts forth Dr Dennett's arguments clearly - but just can't seem to get his \\"head around them\\". Arguments from authority alone are weak, but expertise matters. Dr Harris has left his field.<br /><br />It is almost certain that \\"free will\\" broadly and strongly defined cannot exist. But who defines it this way? The natural world usually doesn't bow to human definitions and preconceptions anyway. This should not besurprising. For \\"free will\\" to have meaning at all, some states should be included, others excluded. Behavioral flexibility may be enough for a functional definition. If it exists or not may be a metaphysically untestable hypothesis, and if so becomes meaningless.<br /><br />My secondary quibble is that once he establishes the absence of strongly defined free will for our awareness  - he feels compelled to make a host of political, social and economic points. Many (but not all) of these, most would agree with. However, this does not seem necessary to this thesis.<br /><br />Well written book from someone whose sincerity and honesty commends affection. Wish it was better.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I purchased Stephen King's 11/23/63 for my wife because she had reserved it from our local public library and started reading the book.  She loves the book, but because it has over 800 pages, the weight of the book became an issue.  My wife had carpal turnnel in both of her hands and holding any thing heavy becomes uncomfortable after a period of time.<br /><br />Stephen King has always been a favorite of my wife, and the Kennedy assination took place when she was in high school so the memory of that day was of interest to her.<br /><br />While she has not yet finished readying this book, she loves her Kindle and takes it with her almost everywhere she goes.<br /><br />Her rating of this novel is I LOVE IT!  Stephen King brings out so much more than simply going back in time to change events and tells a wonderful story of how time travel would complicate the future.

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|As a fan of zombie movies, vampire movies, and most of all, post-apocalyptic movies, this movie was really, really good. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters. From the old worn down hunter, to the young apprentice, struggling to survive in a lost world.<br /><br />This movie wasn't just good in those aspects either. The cinematography also made this movie feel epic, and could easily have been a big theatrical release (even though it wasn't). Definitely worth the price of the rental.<br /><br />Simply described, I would say this movie is cross between \\"The Road\\", \\"Vampires\\" (with James Woods), and a good Romero flick (if you have seen these). If you're a fan of any of these, watch this, you won't be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really enjoy playing this solitaire app. It is simple and easy to use and even playing on random deal setting, I end up winning most of the time.
B005LL4U54|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this soundtrack. Since it was a silent movie, the music played a huge part of the story. I remembered each scene as I listened to it. It was a beautiful movie to watch & the music was very uplifting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book ever no compition . The athur is a genuis. Twilight is second too the hunger games.The best book ever.
B005QUQRE2|3.0|This film deserves a watch, if you like scifi that aspires to be serious drama.  A promising student get sidetracked, falling into a life situation from which she appears unable to recover.  It carries a burden of guilt and she does her best to atone for it.  In the background, a kind of mysterious parallel Earth is discovered nearby, a duplicate in every apparent way, right down to the humans that live on it.  This new earth gets the characters to question things in a realistic and interesting way.  The actress is extremely beautiful and quite good.  Unfortunately, beyond the emotional redemption, not a heckuvalot happens, which disappointed me.  It is very low key hard scifi.  Recommended.

159102594X|4.0|Even sixteen years after the publication of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" fantasy literature in general tends to opt for \\"black versus white\\" two-dimensional plotting and characterization.  Abercrombie has written a very worthy entry for the more contemporary view of fantasy where every protagonist  does not need to be some sort of variation on a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.  They are flawed and sometimes even horrible people, but always entertaining and usually believable.  The \\"bad guys\\" still (at least in this first installment) have a tendency to be through-and-through evil, but everything is also written with a wonderful sense of dark humor which helps to leaven this flaw. As other reviewers have pointed out it's difficult to get a sense of the overall arc of the series since this is not really a \\"stand alone\\" novel, but rather seems to simply choose a convenient point to end with little or nothing in the way of plot resolution.<br /><br />Overall, a quick and very entertaining read and I have moved on to the second installment.
1400052181|5.0|The tenacious author and the daughter of the most famous (but unknown) woman in medical research set out on a remarkable journey to discover the true story of the life and death of Henrietta Lacks - whose biopsied cervical cancer cells sparked a medical research revolution, a multi-million dollar industry, and a medical ethics debate that will probably be raging for decades (but hopefully not centuries) to come.<br /><br />Skloot does a great job of explaining the science and remaining mostly \\"invisible\\", while never forgetting that she is telling a story of real people with real feelings.

1612130283|5.0|I saw reviews about this book on a popular morning show. After reading the sample I purchased it and could not stop reading it until it was finished.  I purchased all three books, one of them at (1a.m.) in the series and wish the author would see fit to feed my addiction some more fifty.  I haven't slept more than 4-5 hours in the last three nights.  I am a very fast reader, I ususally am dissapointed by the length of books and feel like they were to short.  I found myself looking at the percentage of book that was left and being so pleased that there was so much of the story left.<br />It was not over the top BDSM, pretty tame compared to some.  Just enough to be titilating.  It left me wanting more actually.  I was reminded of the early days of crazy love, abandoning oneself into another, the feeling that you cannot get enough of this person.  And then how wonderful it is to find that one person that feels the same way about you too!  And when it lasts, sweet!  I would recommend this to any one who is a romantic or who likes a bit of \\"kink in the sheets\\".

B0070Z97LG|4.0|I rented this movie, not seeing any of the trailers, so I did not know what to expect. I was returning another movie from RedBox and it looked like a horror movie, so I grabbed it. It is not a horror movie, more of a thriller/psychological drama. Each time you think you have the movie all figured out, the plot twists and you realize you have gotten it all wrong. The acting was superb. Fantastic cast. Completely bought the fact that he was retiring from work to spend more time at home with his family in their \\"dream house\\". (Until it all goes downhil from there!) Lol. It was done really well. I feel the negative reviews are way off. It is definitely worth a watch. I recommend it.

0307931803|4.0|We are 4th and 5th graders and we enjoy reading Fox and Socks. This book has very good rhyming. People of  all ages should read this book because it is a fun challenge for your tongue. We love how Dr. Suess put his imagination into this book and how he carefully placed his love into each and every word. We think that fox wanted to teach Knox to not to give up on himself and insisting that Knox can do it. It's a very good book but we want to complaint how at first it was easy but the words started getting difficult because if Dr. Suess wants children to read it the children might not know hard words that Dr.suess makes up.  I would recommend this book for parents, teachers and children because you can read this book at any time. But remember, that this is a tricky tongue twister book so you might want to take it slow.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|I have seen this movie about eleven times, and I still would not mind watching it again. This movie was the one to start a lot of stereotypes about Cuban's. Al Pacino, playing the character of Antonio Montana, made this movie as popular as it is today. He has the ability to go all out, and that's exactly what he does in this movie, He goes all out. But I don't love this movie for the explosions, I love this movie for the story. The way everything seems to turn against \\"Antonio Montana\\" is just amazing. So i would say that if you are thinking of buying this video, go for it, because it is wel worth the money. Doesn't matter if you like Action in the movies you watch, or if you like story, This movie has got it all. I would give this movie 5 stars out of 5. I think it is Al Pacino's best movie...EVER.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I played this game on my Galaxy Nexus and thoroughly enjoyed it. Like some of the other reveiwers I wish that it could be longer also, but it really is inexpensive for what you get. The graphics are spectacular and the puzzles get progressively more difficult as you go along. I showed it to my 10 year old son and he got hooked on it and started his own game from the beginning. I had a hard time getting him to put it down and go to bed last night! I will definitely buy the other game, The Lost City, from this publisher.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to play, hard to master.  Peaceful, easy play that keeps you thinking.  Great thrill when you get it perfectly right the first time.  Sounds are soothing and graphics are very nice.  Would certainly recommend for such a small investment.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Purchased this as a cheap alternative to a server. Added two 2 TB SATA 6 hd in RAID0, 16Gb RAM and i5 CPU. Installed Microsoft Server 2008 r2 on it with no problems and I use DynDNS in order to host a web site. This makes a great web server! Using the same two monitors I use with my regular desktop. It is small, quiet and uses little power so leaving it running all the time is no problem. To add security I installed VirualCloneDrive and run all CD/DVDs as an .iso ~ Loving this little machine.<br /><br />This is not a high end gaming PC because of the limitations of the graphics card but for normal people this machine has the ability to because more of a machine than most people need.

B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|I love this CD!  Die Antwoord's first CD is really varied, pretty weird, and they really shine as artists.  If you are choosing between this one and the 2nd CD, I would definitely recommend this one.  Oh and the lyrics are totally dirty, so don't buy it if you are a prude.
B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|A historic inn is closing after many years, closing not only a connection to the past but also a connection to what happened in the basement. There is a legend about a death and about a body, and it leads to stories told by patrons and staff alike. The two people on-shift have taken note of it too, one going as far as to make a website of his encounter and the other just wanting to look around. what begins as fun at closing time starts to slide into contact, and contact leads to more as the inn slides toward being forgotten.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I had high hopes for this film and actually picked it up after seeing some solid reviews.  for some reason, slow building horror movies seem to make a dent with people who lean toward more mainstream films, and that is alright. If that includes your forays into horror and suspense, this might even be something for you. I liked parts of it, and might have liked it more if something would have happened to keep me going. You had a lot of moments that went up in tempo, getting the music playing and the thrills kicking, and you had things that manifested here and there that seemed to say escalation was in order. In fact, it kept on doing that while trying to stay tense but it all felt hollow after a while, like there should have been a few less false alarms and more contact.<br /><br />Basically, I felt like you had an interesting start, some spooky \\"did you hear that\\" moments, a nice payout toward the end with minimal effects and a \\"its there\\" without the audience seeing it approach to haunting, and an decently interesting end you could see coming. The issue I had was the how long a lot of this took and how redundant revisiting a psychic or watching someone try to find what is making that sound can become. Removing the end because it should always have some payout, a few EVP moments done by not one but two people, a few doors closing and many false alarms, and a strange old man do not making a haunting. It did have some eerie moments and it had all the elements, but just felt like it felt incomplete.<br /><br />to me, the Innkeepers felt like a promise being made and never delivered. That's why I'm going 3/5, saying it was ok, but it should have been better.rie moments and it had all the elements, but just felt like it felt incomplete.<br /><br />to me, the Innkeepers felt like a promise being made and never delivered.

0812992792|4.0|This is a very unusual and really, in places, quite a harrowing book. It is set in an environment which few readers would have any experience of. However, the author has, apparently, made quite a study of North Korea so we must assume that this country is to at least some extent, as described. This is a strange and rather Orwellian society, where there is a constant fear that one will be denounced by family members, colleagues, neighbours or friends and land up in a prison camp without any sort of due process or hope of appeal.<br /><br />However, if, like Jon Do, you have been brought up in this environment you will have learned to live and adapt to it. Hence, being able to come up with an alibi to explain to officials what has happened becomes part of one's existence. The story does not have to be credible, but has to be capable of interpretation so as to show the Democratic Republic of Korea, and, in particular the despotic `Dear Leader' in a favourable light. It is, as a result of this sort of fiction that Jon Dun is declared a Hero of the Revolution and is chosen to go on a diplomatic visit to the USA. Such is the gulf between the Koreans and their hosts that they could be from different planets rather than different countries and this is really the only light hearted part of the book.<br /><br />Jon Do's life changes after this visit since, on the one hand he is viewed with some suspicion in that he may have been contaminated by his contact with the Americans. On the other hand, rather surreally, he is allowed to impersonate a prominent General, and, whilst all are quite aware of the substitution it is another fiction which suits everyone, right up to the Dear Leader, to go along with.<br /><br />The narrative jumps backwards and forwards a bit in time, which is a bit disorientating and often takes the reader a little while to adjust to what is now happening, and at what stage in the story we are at. The prison scenes and the torture are quite hard to take in places, and rather depressing. It put me somewhat in mind of Solzhenitsyn's [[ASIN:0451228146 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]].<br /><br />All in all this was a book which I found interesting, at times absorbing and certainly harrowing. It is a story which noone is likely to finish and say they enjoyed, but I am glad I read it.places, and rather depressing.

B006FTC6ZC|4.0|I already enjoy watching the the two main actors in this movie and with them working together I suspected I would really enjoy the movie. That is a big understatement. It is so funny and shows what a simple misunderstanding can lead to when things get taken out of context. In a lot of ways this is really Dale & Tucker vs Stupid. And they kick stupid into next week!

0439023513|2.0|Spoilers forthcoming. I have read several reviews and agree with many of the assessments that Katniss was far too passive in this book and in the end didn't assert control over her own life. However, I believe that is because Collins took the horrors one step too far by killing Prim.<br /><br />Prim was the one person that Katniss wholly loved, the one person for whom she always kept going and found hope and the will to go on under even the most horrific of circumstances. With that gone, with even Prim taken from her, Katniss is left with a gaping hole in her body and soul that will never heal. Because of this death, I believe she is unable to truly move on and find joy in the years after the revolution. If it had been anyone else--her mother, Gale, even Peeta--Katniss could have made peace with it.<br /><br />Why did Collins have to take this step? The goings-on in the Capitol were horrifying enough--watching Finnick die horrifically, watching all of the innocent refugees killed in the streets (especially the little girl in the yellow rain coat), watching the PEN FULL OF TODDLERS AND CHILDREN blown up was ENOUGH to cause PTSD for years to come.<br /><br />Killing Prim was a critical misstep on Collins' part. It made me wonder--why did Katniss even volunteer for Prim in the reaping all the way back in book 1? If we end up here? I know, I know, because Katniss birthed a revolution--a revolution fueled by people who may have been as corrupt as the Capitol itself. And in the grayness that hangs over Katniss in the end, was it worth it?<br /><br />I know that Katniss would never have been able to live with herself if she let Prim go to the Hunger Games. But this book, and ultimately the series, is totally devoid of hope and redemption. Not a good way to leave a strong and powerful female character like Katniss.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|I remember when `Super 8' was about to drop.  Everyone that I knew was in a state of frenzy.  It just looked so wonderful.  The nostalgia of seeing a science fiction film in the same vein as those pioneered by Steven Spielberg was almost too good to be true.  Could `Super 8' really be this generation's `E.T.'?  The world was on edge and nearly every Oscar prognosticator was prematurely claiming it a lock in nearly every tech category, and some were even claiming that it was on its way to Best Picture and possibly even Best Director glory.<br /><br />Then it opened to lukewarm critical response, fizzled out and walked away with ZERO Oscar nominations.<br /><br />I was one of those who rushed to predict this everywhere, and I was wholly thrilled to see the film.  It just looked so lovely.  The biggest issue with a film like `Super 8' is that it is rather silly.  The bugs were not worked out wholly.  The script, while rich with contagious dialog (the sparring between the child actors is the finest part of the film) is too unsure of itself to aid the film any.  When we are focused on the alien, the film falls apart; and that is a sad fact considering that the whole draw here was, in all respects, the alien.<br /><br />So here's the basic premise.  In Ohio, way back in 1979, there was a young boy named Joe.  Joe's mother has died and he's obviously distraught about it.  His father love him, but he's preoccupied with work (he's the Sheriff's Deputy) and he's a little too hard edged.  Joe's best friend Charles is obsessed with making movies and convinces the neighborhood kids to make a zombie film with him.  While making the film, a train crashes and a `thing' escapes and havoc is set loose on the small town as dogs and eventually people start disappearing.  The military is all over it, the citizens are in a panic and Joe and his friends start searching for the answers.<br /><br />Visually, the film works to a certain extent.  The special effects can feel a little overdone in parts (the crash itself lasts far too long and screams \\"look at me\\") and the alien itself is an uninspired disappointment.  That said, the set pieces are beautifully done and the whole feel of the era portrayed is nicely kept in tone.  The atmosphere of the film's first half is flawless.  In fact, leading up to the actual alien business, I was thinking this film was truly brilliant.  Sadly, it takes a nosedive into clich&eacute; ridden sci-fi with little inspiration to keep it afloat.  The child performances are all great; Elle Fanning proving once again that she deserves an Oscar, but the adults are all simple creations that lack depth.  The token villain (the military Col. Nelec) is a walking stereotype, and Noah Emmerich is a terrible actor.  I hated the ending, for it felt lazy and rushed and so not worthy of the tremendous build up.  In fact, I really wish that the whole alien thing had been scrapped from this movie completely.  It just didn't work.<br /><br />Why couldn't J.J. Abrams have attempted to make this generation's `Stand By Me' instead?<br /><br />Alas, I'm giving this a B-.  It was surely entertaining, despite its failure to live up to my high expectations.  The acting was very nice and the tone of the film was beautifully rendered.

B004SBQAN8|2.0|Like my fellow Ammy reviewer MKIA, I was horrifically disappointed with this film.  I really don't know if I can say I was disappointed, since I really didn't expect a whole lot, but this was exceptionally vapid and somewhat ridiculous in many scenes.  It dissolved into a mere teen angst high school story that had no charisma or intrigue whatsoever.  The saving grace here is the way the special effects are used to bolster our attention.  The fight sequences are very nicely done; but this film truly falls apart thanks to the empty performances by the lead actors.  Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron are empty souls here, delivering NO EMOTION whatsoever and created two of the most unlikable heartthrobs in recent history.  I mean, who wants to watch them?  And this is coming from a Glee supporter who generally likes Agron in the confines of the show, but here she was awful.  I echo mu fellow disgruntled reviewers who compare this to the `Twilight' films.  I have personally never seen the `Twilight' films, but their targeted audience is VERY obvious, and it is certainly obvious that `I Am Number Four' was attempting to capitalize on that.  Caruso's direction is plagued with clich&eacute;s (and this is coming from someone who thought that his `Disurbia' was a clever take on `Rear Window', and actually felt it surpassed Hitchcock's classic).  Alas, I'm getting longwinded about something I wanted to devote a marginal amount of my attention to.  Skip this drek.  That is all.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a Logitech speaker system, but none of the docks (cradles?) that came with it worked for my Ipod Touch. I had an iPod Classic, so I was able to use that with it, but it was really frustrating not to be able to use both. I ran across this a couple of weeks ago, and I am rejoicing. Especially since my iPod Classic is now an iBrick. This adapter is perfect.
B001GQSY64|4.0|I bought this movie with the hope that my new son and I could watch it and the rest of the Clone Wars animated series together.<br /><br />I was looking for ways to get him into one of my passions, so I started buying the Clone Wars TV series, and after a few episodes, realized I should watch the movie before going further. I was definitely not disappointed with my purchase.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of adventure and action, but without any gore. It sets the stage nicely for the series coming after, which is full of good lessons for kids.<br /><br />Cons: It is definitely geared toward children, so that may be an issue for some. It also is probably best for an introduction into the series, as opposed to a stand alone movie.
B005LJITS0|2.0|I was trying to decide which movie to see after work btwn this and X-Men. I checked out the time length and that really should have been a clue. How much of an origin story can be told in 90 minutes? As a disclosure, I have never read a GL comic, but I am a fan of the superhero movies. I was fully prepared to like it so much that I would buy an anthology of comics. The patheticness of this movie makes me want to check out the comics to see what the real story is about, but forget about ever adding this movie to my collection.<br /><br />I had a few problems with this movie. As much as I love Reynolds as an actor, I did not see him as this character. I felt like I was watching Ryan. It's as though I was always conscious of him. As for Blake Lively, I've seen Gossip Girl, so I know who she is. But in this movie, she felt like a gimmick. As though the producers said, \\"which young starlet should be in this movie?\\" I felt that Ryan and Blake had no chemistry. Some people, IMO, just don't fit this genre (cough cough Katie Holmes cough cough). Their kiss at the end made me cringe. In the beginning, when she was in pilot mode, I was surprised and thinking \\"oh OK, so she's gonna be different from all the other distressed damsels\\" (again, I've never read the comics). I thought the movie would have other plans, but it ended up being cliche.<br /><br />I mentioned in my title that I dozed off. Well, the last scene I recall was Peter Saarsgard in pain in his bed, and then I woke up and Green Lantern had formed some race track or something. I have NO clue what I missed and only figured it out based on the plot summary.<br /><br />Lots of wasted familiar faces here: Tim Robbins, Angela Bassett (total surprise) and Mark Strong. The battle scene with Parallax was over so quick. And I'm no scientist, but how did Hal get so close to the sun w/o getting singed?<br /><br />This just wasn't up to snuff. I fully expect this movie to be shunned in a way similar to the Eric Bana version ofthe 'Hulk.\\" Although this movie does seem to be given a bit more credit than that one, it will always be overshadowed by the incredible superhero flicks we've in the last decade.
B007BLDFWG|5.0|I loved this movie! Elizabeth Olsen delivers a gripping performance. You can feel her awkward struggle to conform back into normal society. You feel what she is going through. I could definitely relate to her actions after seeing the traumatic events she endured. The ending isn't ideal for most audiences but I understand why they ended where they did. Great movie, great actors, a must see!

B005J4TLN4|4.0|My bias...<br /><br />Loves: A good, under the radar action flick.<br />Likes: British movies<br />Dislikes: Most sci-fi<br />Hates: Hard to understand accents<br /><br />Attack The Block was a film from early 2011 that slipped under my radar. I had heard buzz growing about the internet, but never had the chance to watch it. When it came to the end of the year lists, I saw it pop up on several, which made my interest grow even more, so naturally, I finally took the time to hunt down my copy.<br /><br />Attack The Block centers around a group of thugs in a London neighborhood who are front and center when an alien invasion of sorts hits town. The action is tense and the creature design is really cool in a 'less is more' way. I loved the direction of this movie and the pace never lets up. It has a lot of 'edge of your seat' moments. Yes, it's got it's problems (which I will highlight below), and Nick Frost doesn't have much to do, but I had a ton of fun watching it. You just have to get past...the accents. The thick British accents are very 'working class' and a lot of the slang and dialog had me scratching my head. It didn't effect the story at all - that's pretty straightforward - but I'm sure I missed some tidbits along the way.<br /><br />Attack The Block is one fun time at the movies. If you like movies like District 9 or (to a lesser extent) Super 8, see this immediately.<br /><br />Score: 4/5
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus opens abruptly and carries you to a visual smorgassboard of delights.  The imagery in this book is phenomenal.  The plot and sub plots evolve beautifully, carrying you with them.  If you like mystery, romance and a little of the supernatural this book is for you.  I'm reading it again just for the joy of the visual images.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|Rubinstein, at his best, was superlative. If you have no great interest in Rubinstein, but are looking for a conspectus of most of the obvious (few Beethoven sonatas) and not-so-obvious piano solo, chamber and concerto repertoire, this could even fit the bill. Falla, Saint-Saens, Brahms's chamber works... all in never-less-than-good performances.<br /><br />But if you are a Rubinstein afficionado, or just a plain piano-lover, and are hesitating... don't. Beautifully presented; in wonderful sound; so very cheap: what is arguably the greatest collection of recordings by one pianist yet. Others have noted the technical details: suffice to say that I find it hard to fault the transfers. The new Carnegie Hall items are sonically ropy, but pianistically wonderful. The Moscow recital (originally Melodiya, but available in the earlier Rubinstein Edition) is missing (and it is wonderful); otherwise everything is there. And I agree that having things in their original LP couplings (and lengths) is ideal: you sit and listen to a single concerto, rather than picking your way through 80-minute disks.<br /><br />Also missing is the 1910 Favorit Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody (in case you were wondering), although it is alluded to. The International Piano Archive doesn't have a copy. So the most determined completists will have something for which they can continue to search...
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|The emotions I felt when I got to the last line of this book can only be summed up as follows: amazed, moved, and wanting more of John Clark and Ding Chavez.  Ever since its release, this book has topped my personal charts as the greatest book I have ever read, without a doubt in my mind.  Thank you, Mr. Clancy, for giving the world such a riveting and exciting adventure to embark upon, and such rich characters to guide us through it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|*caution spoilers*<br /><br />I admit, I wrote an angry review about the first book. In my defense it was written late at night and I was probably not entirely coherent. I actually liked most of the book it was just the shock of the Clary and Jace relationship being brought to a screeching and entirely unacceptable halt. It pissed me off so much that I refused to read another book from the series unless I was reassured it isnt really how it seems. Obviously, I was reassured. I am pleased to say I liked this book much better as a whole. It was easier to get into, I think the first book was too much to take in and kinda mind blowing. Also I like how the characters get more depth to them. Though the burning question of the Clary / Jace relationship werent answered they were alluded to. I wasnt really happy with how it ended but thats how it goes with books in a serious. Anyways, i liked it and i advise those who may also have been turned off by several points in the first book to perservere because it gets better.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen both the Swedish version and the American version of this big screen adaptation of a great book and I have to say that the American version stayed true to the book much better and it flowed better too.  The American version dealt with the Wennerström affair better and dealt with the relationship between Blomkvist and Salander better.  As a whole the American version fit all of what made the book great into it while the Swedish version cut out mostly everything that didn't have anything to do with the search for Harriet Vanger which was a little disappointing.  So 5 stars for the American version and 4 stars to the Swedish version as it was a very good movie despite the changes in the story.
0545123275|5.0|Cole St. Clair is my favorite in the Shiver series and he's not in this book. The whole series is great though. The writer is sooo good. I could not find many things wrong in this book, really none at all. At the beginning of Shiver it took me a little bit to see what was going on, but it was still good then. I have read everything by the writer and all her books are good and unique, not always the perfect ending but always an ending that is good.

0545265355|5.0|I read this series when I was pregnant and it got me through sleepless nights. I wouldn't have slept anyway because it was so good! The one complaint I have is the ending. I prefer a happy ending and I know you may argue but I did not think the ending was happy for enough people. I'm thrilled about the movie! Saved this series box set for my daughter when she's old enough to deal with the violence.
B0052U59F4|1.0|I am halfway through the book and even when reading the first page I could tell I wouldn't enjoy it. Mainly because I find the writing to be overly sophomoric and simple. There is no depth to the characters or places described in this novel. Everyone/thing seems one dimensional and lacking any intrigue.<br /><br />The protagonist, 21 year old Ana, is so juvenile that all the sexual encounters have the air of pedophilia, which of course is not erotic. The hero male character, Christian, is a sociopath in need of severe therapy. Additionally, If I have to read about his long fingers one more time I might scream. Does anyone else picture E.T. when they read about his long index finger?<br /><br />I feel as if the author is not at all a writer but simply into the BDSM lifestyle. It is a rudimentary look into her fantasy life and I have no clue how it was even published. Her lack of vocabulary makes the book repetitive and mundane; except for when she decides to use a thesaurus and uses out of place \\"S.A.T.\\" words.<br /><br />I will actually go as far to say that this novel gives the BDSM/Fetish lifestyle an awful, one sided rap. It reminds me of how television shows portray someone with bipolar disorder. This is how society dictates BDSM and it is not at all a true look into this multi-layered lifestyle.<br /><br />Save your money and time, read a better book.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|I bought this movie after reading several of the reviews.  I was not disappointed in the least.  I won't summarize the movie - that's been done.  All I can say, is about half way in the movie I found I could no longer sit down.  I was totally sucked into the movie and was wondering how often a blizzard happens on this mountain in July.  Was it a freak of nature?  Well, anyway, I was riveted and my heart was pumping and I felt totally a part of the climbing team - feeling every cold hand grasp and every narrow slip.  Just wait until you watch the climber lose a glove - down, down it goes and my hands immediately felt frozen.

B000063DFN|5.0|First I must state that I believe Iron Maiden are the greatest metal band ever. The string of incredible albums in the '80s were untouchable, by any other band. How can there be 1 star reviews for this album? Obviously some people don't know metal, but the Metal Skull does. Let's dissect this album. The first 2 songs, ironically the 2 singles, Aces High & 2 Minutes To Midnight are perhaps the greatest start to an album ever. Another good example would be Random Acts Of Senseless Violence & Fueled the first 2 songs on Anthrax - Stomp 442. Next on Powerslave we have one of my favorite instrumentals Losfer Words (Big 'Orra), if this doesn't have you headbanging buy a Culture Club cd. Flash Of The Blade follows with an incredible riff that shows more of their infectious rhythms. Now we have probably my least favorite song on the album The Duellists, and it is still a great song. Now on to the incredible last 3 songs, side 2 for those that remember vinyl albums. I don't know what to say about Back To The Village except for this: what a great way to start the second side. Next up Powerslave. I have been to Egypt and this song definitely ran through my head while I was there in the tombs of the Valley Of The Kings. Bruce's maniacal laughter in the opening still brings chills. Now to the final track Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. This is my personal favorite song that is over 10 minutes and that is including stiff competition ( Rush - 2112, Dream Theater - The Glass Prison, Pink Floyd - Pigs (Three Different Ones). Read the classic poem and appreciate this masterpiece album closer. This album really shows the incredible lyrics Iron Maiden are known for. If you are a metal fan this is an essential album, and if you don't have it, then run to the nearest record store, or computer and buy this 5 star album.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|WE LOVED THIS SEASON OF MACGYVER.  YOU CAN LEARN SO MUCH FROM THESE SHOWS.  MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON WANTS TO BE MACGYVER AND THINKS HE IS.  LOL
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I went into this film having never read the books, though I knew something about the world. I did for example know what a Thark was going in. And having seen it I have to pay this film the highest compliment I can give: I want to read the books. I fear that a sequel will never be made, and while the film doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se it does feel rather like the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring. And that is sad because of all the movies out there getting sequels at the moment I can think of no world I'd rather go back to than this one.<br /><br />The world is the main selling point of this film. Mars (or Barsoom) is an ancient world, dry and dying. It is filled with beautiful red deserts (which I feel could have been a little more red but still...) and strange peoples. The strangest are probably the Tharks: nine-foot tall green aliens with big tusks and anger issues. They are led by Tars Tarkas, an excellent Willem Dafoe who apparently acted out the part on stilts. The Tharks are what the Na'vi should have been. They may have some of the characteristics of the 'noble savage' but they are also violent and not particularly friendly to outsiders. In other words they have the capacity to be noble but they can also be a genuine threat.<br /><br />If I occasionally compare this film to Avatar or other films it is an unfortunate necessity. Many science fiction epics have stolen much from John Carter. This has led to many complaints of 'having seen it before' and 'it's ripping off other, better films.' Many of these critics don't realize that John Carter is the work that has been ripped off, not vice versa, and even for those who do it doesn't matter. They are film critics after all, not literary ones. The most obvious case of the movie 'ripping off' a 'better' movie is in the arena sequence. This looks exactly like the sequence from the end of Attack of the Clones. Even though it is done better and makes more sense here, I can't deny that it looks like a blatant rip off to those not in the know. But on the whole I was surprised how new and fresh it appears. The ships and costumes are amazing. They used an admirable amount of restraint in making them feel used and lived in. The motorbike-type ships offer the best example of this. The wings fold up and pop out only when in use. In every film I've seen for the last fifteen years the action of opening/closing the sails would be a big complicated affair to show off how cool the technology is. Here it simply pops open. It feels like a real piece of technology that one might use rather than a cheap gimmick. As to the costumes, they are uniformly excellent. They feel lived in, and if they are slightly campy they never go overboard.<br /><br />I'd call the story fairly basic, although there is much detail given along the way. There is an evil general called Sab Than who wants to take over Mars and so he wishes to marry princess Deja Thoris of his rival city. Pretty standard stuff, and he seems a thoughtless brute right out of Flash Gordon or some other adventure serial. Where things get interesting is in the people controlling him. For he is not the film's main villain, merely their puppet. The true villains of the piece are the Tharns, a race of immortals who can disguise their appearance at will and who feed off the destruction of worlds. They've given great power to Than since he seems most likely to achieve this end. He's a good choice too since he causes such a big commotion that people don't think to look beyond him for even darker motives. The really nice thing about the Tharns is that they aren't really brute force villains. They don't destroy the planets, they simply arrange for the inhabitants to do so. They are a quite genuine threat, and when they're done with Mars their next stop is Earth. I don't understand why that little fact has been left out of the trailers.<br /><br />It is through the Tharns that John Carter ends up on Mars. They have the ability to transport themselves between worlds and Carter ends up on Mars by accident after killing one. Here we get one of the film's few missteps. The scenes on Earth take up about twenty minutes and are not particularly engaging, despite Bryan Cranston as a Union officer trying to recruit Carter into the army for some undeveloped reason. Oh yeah, it's 1868 and John Carter is a Confederate veteran from Virginia. Kinda important to know that. Fortunately, once he gets to Mars there is rather more life in the film. John finds that he is insanely strong and has the ability to jump really high due to the lower gravity on Mars. Once there he ends up stuck in one bad situation after another as he acclimates himself to the world. Naturally it's not long before he runs into princess Deja who is fleeing her forced wedding.<br /><br />Character-wise Deja is the real standout. Many people have compared her to princess Leia, but while this comparison is not without merit she is very much her own character. She manages to come off as tough and noble without it feeling forced. I often find female action heroes to be lacking a certain credibility that the guys acquire more easily, yet in this case I found the girl more believable a fighter than the guy. Partly it comes down to the inconsistency of his superpoweredness, but there is also the fact that Taylor Kitsch just isn't a very good actor. He certainly doesn't ruin the film, but he doesn't particularly impress either. That's probably a good part of why the Earth scenes felt flat. They could have really used a better leading man in this role. Fortunately the supporting cast more than make up for it. As with most epic films of this sort the lead character is a somewhat blank slate simply to provide a focus of normality in the crazy world. I've mentioned most of the supporting cast already, but especial props must go out to Mark Strong and Willem Dafoe. Mark Strong is the lead Thern, and for a character who never emotes or acts even remotely menacing he manages to be quietly terrifying. But in some ways he has it easy since he is in an comparatively uncumbersome costume. Willem Dafoe was acting on stilts in the middle of the Arizona desert knowing all the while that he would be digitally replaced in post-production, yet his Tars truly feels like a living character. The other actors do their part well and while there is a fair amount of overacting there are no really bad performances here. Even Kitsch manages to be decent if unimpressive.<br /><br />The rest of the production is similarly first-rate. Effects, scripting, editing - all top class. The musical score is very nice, though they do tend to repeat just one theme instead of creating several. The action scenes have been criticized as sub-standard, but I don't see it. For me the key mark of a good action scene is that I actually care what happens in it. On that mark they certainly succeed. If they could have used more inventive plotting, well that's a fairly minor flaw. A more substantial problem which critics can't seem to get over is the nature of the world. People are flying around in airships powered by light, yet they're still fighting with swords. This is one of those things you can just either accept or not. I have no problem with suspending my disbelief, but I get that others can't. To which I simply have this to say: this movie isn't for you. This film is likely to have a fairly narrow audience, although I imagine it would be popular with the majority of kids. Those who can appreciate this kind of thing, and can ignore that it's set on Mars, are likely to find that it is amazingly good fun.<br /><br />I'm rather amazed that this film got made at all. it is not the sort of movie studio execs like to see. Aliens, a campy story (on Mars no less), and a rather eccentric group of characters, all with no big star. It's amazing it ever got funded. People seem uninterested in seeing it, which is very unfortunate as this is a film which deserves to succeed.I want to see more of the marvelous world of Barsoom and the further adventures of John Carter. But Disney seems uncertain of how to market this, as evidenced by the removal of the iconic \\"From Mars\\" from after John Carter's name. This is a film which you will either love or not. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some people love sushi, but I can't stand it. That doesn't mean that sushi is bad and everything I like good. The simplest way to figure out whether you will like this film is to ask yourself whether the idea of swordfights in airships and green aliens on Mars appeals to you. If it does then the odds are that you'll like this movie. If you're not sure, give it a shot. you may be surprised. But if that just sounds silly and ridiculous then avoid this movie.

B000FC0V3E|1.0|I can honestly say that this is the first book I have ever really disliked, and I have been an avid reader of all types of books for decades. I honestly gave it a chance even though I wanted to stop reading it about 1/3 of the way through.  Having never ever not finished a book, I labored on. It was full of boring descriptions and antics and none of the characters had any substance.  When I did get to the end I asked myself, \\"What was the plot?\\"

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Pull the Wool over your eyes! Um, or just let your eyes move over the words like normal...either way, read this one!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go into this knowing as little as possible.  You'll be hooked in the first chapter.<br /><br />Follow the clues Hugh gives you and try to see where the story is going before it's...TOO LATE.  Haha.  With such suspense and tension throughout this series I'm feeling a little under-stressed now that I'm done reading.<br /><br />If you need to know more I'd describe this as a tragic detective story unfolding into a tapestry of conspiracies, revelations, and dystopian SciFi at its best.  It's a battle with Human nature wielding engineering smarts in one corner vs. a Clandestine fascist regime packing cold logic in another.  It's the impossible odds the heroes struggle to overcome that makes the story so cool. It's wild how a story taking place in such a claustrophobic setting can loom so large thanks to the ideas packed into it.<br /><br />You'll love the the main characters especially one from the second half (I think of her as Ms. MacGyver, you'll know who I mean).<br /><br />At the end, with so many possibilities for more stories in the Wool quilt Hugh is weaving, you can't help imagining how the next chapters will play out.  I can't wait for Wool 138!

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride And Prejudice, Jane Austen<br /> (This review was originally published at The Brazen Broads' Book Bash)<br /><br />A Timeless Classic...<br /><br />For anyone who has never read Pride And Prejudice, this Broad would urge you to crack the cover! If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!<br /><br />The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.<br /><br />Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.<br /><br />When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.<br /><br />Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.<br /><br />After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.<br /><br />~Moirans.

Now I gave it as a present to a friend and she also loved it. Also my friends who were forced to watch it with me liked it.<br />Once is the cutest love story without even a kiss. It seems all so real and not acted out (probably because from my knowledge the characters are no actors and they became a real couple after the movie was made). I also really liked the music - I also bought the soundtrack ;) - and the Oscar for that is well deserved!

B0061QD7YS|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is one of my favorite disney movies of all time. Having it now on blu-ray and digital copy is so wonderful for a lover of this movie. The bonus feature is also pretty interesting for what its worth. I recomeend this movie if you love and disney animated movie where it was mostly about animals besides humans. However, I've read reviews of parents going crazy over the tiniest things so keep in mind, this movie might not be perfect for your kids if your over-protective.<br />Unlike most disney movies, no one really dies except an evil rat and possibly a dog but you can always bs your kids and say the dog was adopted or something like that. The moral of the movie is very good and encourages everyone to watch this movie.<br />My final word of advice, if you like this movie and know what has happened recently to disney movies that are hits and get sequals, the sequals normally suck. Lady and the Tramp II is an extremely har movie to love so don't buy that movie if you haven't seen if before. The moral is part Lady and the Tramp, animations makes you cry with like the difference between the fox and the hound movies, dioluge of like the fox and the hound 2, and some touchy feeling like Bambi II...<br />Enjoy this movie like I do!!

0385344228|5.0|What a great book! I just finished reading it last night, which I did on my Kindle. I'm not sure how I even stumbled upon this work, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of other legal mysteries, this is not a story-line designed to answer the question, 'Who dunnit?\\" Yes, there is that element to the book, but that's actually more of a background piece to a larger story. Instead, we take a journey along with the father of a teenage boy, as he finds himself confronted with multiple challenges simultaneously.<br /><br />The author does a great job of weaving past and present through the book, zeroing-in on key topics such as parenting, career, marriage, loyalty, and one's struggle with family 'ghosts.' The book is also timely, in that Facebook plays a prominent role, as does the issue of adolescent impulse control (popular in the media right now, due to several teenage-spawned crimes), and genetic influences over personality and behavior (didn't we see a Newsweek cover story devoted to that topic recently?).<br /><br />The book is broken down into several manageable chapters, which I like, as I read in bed at night and can barely do a chapter or two at a time. I wasn't sure the author was going to pull together all the loose strings at the end (I was at 98% on my Kindle and I still had a lot of unanswered questions), but he did so, without the rushed and sloppy quality we see in many other books (I read 'LTTLE BEE' and totally loved it until I got to the end; that was a perfect example of an author trying to wrap everything up and doing so in a careless way). In its own way, the book came to a comfortable end, which in turn left me feeling thoughtful as opposed to critical of the book or the time I spent reading it.<br /><br />I wouldn't categorize this book as 'suspenseful' or a 'thriller,' but it held my attention throughout. Ok, I got a little weary-eyed when he was covering the testimony of one of the criminal investigators--as this went on longer than it should have--but I skimmed ahead without missing too much. I've read some Grisham novels where I'm rapidly turning pages (or 'rolling' the screen since I now read most books on the Kindle) due to the rush and intensity. This isn't that kind of book. Rather, the author writes very well; he's extremely thoughtful; and he never veers-off on a ramble or discourse about something unrelated to the topic at hand.<br /><br />In sum, it was a great book and I'm glad I found it.hould have--but I skimmed ahead without missing too much.

0061537934|5.0|I recently reviewed this book, gave it one star, said bad things about it, when all of a sudden, I realized I thought I was reviewing Dogs of Babel.  I LOVED The Art of Racing in the Rain!  I read too many dog books, evidently.  So many that I got them mixed up.  To all, my deepest apologies, and in the future, I will have to be much more careful.  This is a great book!  I enjoyed it very much.  So sorry for the mixup.  I deleted my previous review.  Please forgive.

B000FC1AGG|5.0|How many times did I laugh out loud? Too many to count.<br /><br />Emma is a funny character. Imagine spilling every one of your most private secrets to someone, and finding out later that they're your boss!! Awkward. What makes it even funnier is that Emma's secrets themselves are just downright hilarious. How does Sophie Kinsella even think of this stuff?<br /><br />If you're looking for a good romance with humor, this is your book. Sometimes I just want to read something light and this really hit the mark. The writer really knows how to get the pages turning. Yes, there are formulaic elements to the book, but she puts a new spin on a lot of it so that it feels fresh and different. Her characters are people you want to read more about. And you're rooting for them too. I liked the whole premise. It was fun!<br /><br />I would reread this book, and for me that's pretty rare, so that's saying something!!!!

B006ZCWTZG|3.0|Bruce wants to carve lyrics in stones that can be thrown at the fortresses of power. The problem is that he has abandoned the storytelling that got him here. His small was always writ large, and now, on Wrecking Ball, it's all large, even when invoking the weak and exploited among us. His brilliant \\"The Rising\\" in response to the World Trade Center attack, dealt in majestic language that dropped down, at least in brush strokes, into identifiably real lives. The power there was fueled by a cohesive musical vision. Here, that musical vision feels very much that of a producer, one I've never heard of making his first appearance on a Springsteen record. It's bloated and poorly defined. I hate the lousy choirs and cheap artificial drums and layer upon layer of stuff. Penny whistles bleating through what could be a Fairlight Computer. Where is the thunder? The enterprise is more dirigible, impressive but in no way agile. I can imagine, over time, hooking into some of this, but Bruce used to grab you by the jugular right away. He sings out battle cries on \\"Wrecking Ball\\" but shows up to the battlefield in a Toyota Avalon. The late Clarence Clemons makes a stirring appearance in a recycled (from the New York live album) \\"Land of Hopes and Dreams,\\" and I like this studio version just fine. Most of the record, however, feels like the work of a once-important late-middle-aged pro who no longer prowls and breathes the fire of the night. I still like to believe some day this brilliant hero will find his best form again. Bruce is too great to count out. It's just not happening here.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Goodreads Description- A mysterious island.<br /><br />An abandoned orphanage.<br /><br />A strange collection of very curious photographs.<br /><br />It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow--impossible though it seems--they may still be alive.<br /><br />A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.<br /><br />I really really wanted to like this more than I did.  It has such possibility to be an edgier book especially with all of the \\"circus freak\\" like pictures included in the book.  It was only unti after reading it for a few days that I realized it is a YA book, so that explained why it was so much more tame than I expected it.  I loved the plotline and the photographs added a deeper element of character.  Even though I only rated it a 4, I would highly recommend this book to anyone because this book has inspired me to search for a book along this line but with more adult themes.

0062103377|4.0|It was a good read. The author really captured the voice of bobby singer. But there was som downsides to the book as well. To start of he made a reference to the tv show lost, witch i really thougt was stupid. I don't think that Bobby watches ABC's prime time shows. And another part wqas the first story about Ashtown, it was incomplete. But appart from that the book was very good.

0385535139|2.0|Remember the days when a John Grisham book meant fast-paced action coupled with deep ethical questions? Unfortunately, those days are long gone. Grisham's best book of the past decade, ironically, was his nonfiction \\"An Innocent Man.\\" His feeble attempts at fiction are more like public relations for John Edwards and other tort lawyers. Other than a rather humorous scene where a bungling arsonist gets shot by an ambulance-chasing lawyer protecting his office, there is little in the way of action in \\"The Litigators.\\" What little courtroom drama exists is confined to the final third of the book. I had to force myself through the first two-thirds. All-in-all, another lump of coal by a writer who used to give us diamonds.
0316017930|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has become one of the world's most famous writers based on his ability to tell a good simple story that resonates.  He won't offer you deep thoughts or stunning detail, but he does have a homely, sincere, and compelling voice.  That's what makes \\"Outliers,\\" the book that established him as a business mind, so easy and fun to read.<br /><br />But there's a dark side to Gladwell's siren-like voice:  it distracts us from asking deep and disturbing questions about success.  Take J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Gladwell praises as a great American success story.  Gladwell's understanding of Oppenheimer comes from his reading of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"American Prometheus,\\" and Gladwell's reading is very different from mine.  First, there's a major factual error in Gladwell's retelling.  While it's true that Oppenheimer did try to poison his Cambridge supervisor and got caught doing so, it wasn't Oppenheimer who managed to talk his way out of punishment -- it was his gregarious and socially adept father Julius who managed to convince the Cambridge dons to give his son a second chance, thus saving Oppenheimer's scientific career.  Second and more controversial is how Oppenheimer came to head the Manhattan Project.  Leslie Groves, the general who picked Oppenheimer, was impressed by the great man's charisma and scientific skills (both of which were evident to everyone), but Groves was first and foremost impressed by the man's over-reaching ambition, which in Groves' mind made Oppenheimer easy to control.  And Groves was right.  When Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked, he had the opportunity to finally speak out in public against the hydrogen bomb -- but he didn't, hoping to eventually win back his security clearance, and thus his entryway into the corridors of power.  Whatever considerable talents the man had was ultimately overshadowed by his blind ambition.  Is Oppenheimer really such a success story then?<br /><br />Many of Gladwell's argumentsare fine arguments, but by failing to look into the bigger question -- what is success, and what is its costs? -- he misses too much in his book.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon have accomplished a portrait of paranoid schizophrenia which is the most accurate (to those who have known these sufferers) to date with the exception of a far bleaker film: [[ASIN:B000H5U5RG Clean, Shaven (The Criterion Collection)]].<br /><br />The difference here is that Nichols wants to show how deeply linked the hallucinations, dreams and daily disturbances of a schizophrenic are to daily reality, in particular to our global feeling that the next shoe might drop at any time.  If anyone watching imagines that Curtis' behavior is unrealistic or that Shannon's natural ability to be eccentric and frightening are exaggerations of what these people (and their loved ones) go through, think again.  Having worked with the homeless/mentally ill (unfortunately a lot of men and women like Curtis simply fall through the cracks) I have always made it a policy to keep apocalyptic material AWAY from them.  The miracle Nichols pulls off here is to reflect so expertly what happens when these symptoms first start developing through Curtis' mind.<br /><br />A blue collar construction worker and generally an average man (Officer Van Alden from [[ASIN:B003Y5HWJU Boardwalk Empire: The Complete First Season]] is absent here)  Curtis has a wonderful wife (Jessica Chastain who resembles Mia Farrow to an almost disturbing degree) and a sweet little girl who is handicapped (Tova Stewart).  His buddy on the construction site (Shea Wigham)is the first one to really notice that something's just not right with our man.  As the result of exactly one simple rainstorm, Curtis begins to develop brief but very potent hallucinations involving thunder, rain, and his dog.  Since thunder can make certain canines so scared they turn vicious I'm pretty sure Nichols is not setting Curtis up as a prophet proper.  He is trying to communicate the subtle and explosive panic developing in Curtis' mind.<br /><br />The first move that lets you know this guy is hurting is when he makes a financially risky move on a tight budget, taking out a home improvement loan for an old tornado shelter.  He puts his dog in a wire rimmed fence in the backyard though he's done nothing to deserve this punishment.<br /><br />He then begins to stock up food, has his buddy help him steal equipment from work to dig a bigger tunnel in his yard, and gets laid off.  His explosion at the Community Benefit Dinner is the most representative of the character's struggle, screaming about a storm that is coming with the zeal of a Pentecostal preacher from the work of Flannery O' Connor.  The misery that mental illness of this kind inflicts on families is reflected almost perfectly here.  His wife makes ends meet only after realizing her husband is disturbed.<br /><br />The ending is what people are arguing about.  It really could be anything--a shared subjective vision, a hallucination Curtis has when he is asleep and about to leave for the beach on the doctor's orders.  I think Nichols was borrowing from [[ASIN:B00005QAPI The Last Wave (The Criterion Collection)]] and a quote in that film: \\"A dream is the shadow of something real.\\"<br /><br />This deserves the attention it's getting because it puts into mainstream view what severely mentally disturbed people suffer everyday.  Not everyone can afford doctors, medication, and not all these stories have a happy ending.  The best movie I've seen concerning this subject along with [[ASIN:B000T5O48K Bug (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000H5U5RG Clean, Shaven (The Criterion Collection)]].makes a financially risky move on a tight budget, taking out a home improvement loan for an old tornado shelter.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Jacob is a teen, from a wealthy family, who deeply loves his grandfather.  He also loves his grandfathers \\"tall tales\\" and later ventures to find the truth about them.<br /><br />I love the originality of the overall story line; however, I felt the writer lost his originality with predictable plots and typical teen angst.  I had some difficulty getting through the first pages; then, later became very engaged with the story, only to be let down again.  I felt that the writer was all over the place, with no true direction; and, I found it difficult to really relate to any one character. He also has a good knack for overly describing scenes that don't really contribute to the story line. This story abruptly stops, possibly leaving an opening for a second book.  I really loved the vintage photos provided and they added a nice touch to the book.<br /><br />Read on Kindle Fire via OverDrive.

1423140591|5.0|I bought this for my son who is a very big fan of Rick Riordan.  He wrote a book report for school after reading this, and truly did enjoy the novel.  I just asked him if he would recommend this to his fellow classmates, and he said \\"Yeah.\\"  He did complain that the beginning was slow and had a hard time sticking with the book long enough to get to the good stuff, but he knew from reading the author's past novels that once he did, it would be great.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|This case is effective but I find that my son doesn't use it much. It's been used about 3-4 times since Christmas. The product itself is sturdy enough but since we haven't had much use, I don't think I would purchase another. The case is quite smaller than I had pictured.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Though some of the actors voices aren't as strong as the actors in some of the CDs of the productions and the 2 key chandelier scenes weren't as highly produced as the stage version (probably due to the difficultly in having it crash for the film)... regardless, this was a great production of the play. It was shot for both film and done before a live audience. The production, cinematography, filming and choreography were outstanding and made up not being able to actually be in the audience. It really was the next best thing to being there... I can't say enough for the camera work!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B001J32H6M|5.0|Once again, John Williams shows why he is probably the undisputed master of film scores. He has a lot of competition (Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, Lalo Schifrin, Hans Zimmer) but considering the number of blockbuster films he has scored, I'd put him at the top - since it is likely his scoring abilities that contributed in no small way to the success of these films.<br /><br />'Temple of Doom', being the darkest of the 'Indy' series, got a lot of criticism that was largely undeserved. Williams' score, however, is beyond reproach - particularly with this soundtrack release. This is pretty much the complete score; nothing glaring is left out. In the previous release of the soundtrack (1984), the limitations of vinyl were obvious; in addition, the market largely viewed soundtracks as a poor investment (in spite of the interest of us soundtrack buffs) and offered limited releases of them, if at all (even Williams' masterpiece 'Return of the Jedi' score had been released only in a 1-LP album with very limited tracks the previous year). The CD release of this film, by comparison, changed all that - significantly for the better.<br /><br />Several of the tracks are previously unreleased or contain previously unreleased cues; most notable of some of these are 'Indy negotiates', as Jones angrily deals with a Chinese gangster trying to swindle him; 'Map-Out of Fuel', as Indy, Willie & Short Round make a narrow escape from a plane over the Himalayas before it hits a mountainside; 'The Scroll/To Pankot Palace', as Indy & his friends make their way towards the Palace by elephant, and Indy finds a chilling statue of Kali. 'The Mine Car Chase', a wild, fast-paced melody that gives the flutes/piccolos a workout as Indy, Willie & Short Round race through the mine in a mine car, trying to escape Mola Ram's sinister thugs, is great fun. 'The Sword Trick', a previously unreleased track, has a cue from 'Raiders' in it (from the sequence when Indy took on the Arab Swordsman). It is very subtle - you would have to listen closely to hear it. 'The Broken Bridge/British Relief' is a great track featuring brass & percussion as Indy cuts through the bridge supports, sending the Thuggee guards plummeting to their deaths in a crocodile-filled river. The only part missing in this track was the great low drums that started this sequence (as the Thuggee guards closed in on Indy from opposite sides of the bridge).<br /><br />It is a shame the full score was not released 25+ years ago when the movie was made. Glad to see it released now!subtle - you would have to listen closely to hear it.

Gotta love that \\"internal clock\\" we all have...<br /><br />Had a pre-set for Mon-Fri at 6:30AM, before going to sleep last night changed my time to 6:45AM, BIG MISTAKE obviously. Didn't wake up until 7:34AM by myself and checked the settings on app. Everything is intact and accurate. Time to look elsewhere for a better app. Has to be some type of bug when changing the time somewhere and it not registering. Thought I'd share my experience, use with caution.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I'm a grown man who enjoys Twilight . . . but I did not enjoy this film.  Much of the movie I was waiting for the plot to start after an extra long wedding and honeymoon scene, but it never did.  Then it took great liberties and departed from the book.

This one worked in terms of speed, but the USB connection was not recognized by my computer or laptop. I again contacted customer service, and again was sent a replacement unit.

1577312082|2.0|This is a nice reading of Tolle's work, done by the author.  Comments about his reading style aside (to each his own in the regard), these CDs have a serious problem: the tracks do not break at sensible points.  Some tracks begin with the sound of a bell and Tolle beginning to talk about an idea or read from the start of a chapter or section.  Other tracks, most of them in fact, begin in the middle of a talk someplace, and a more than a few begin in the middle of sentences.<br /><br />If you're listening to it straight through, you won't notice.  But if you want to stop at the end of a track and then start the next track in sequence later, the editing makes doing so extremely difficult.  Instead of just remembering which track you last listened to, you have to remember which track and how far into the track you were when you hit pause or stop.<br /><br />Most annoying.

B000OXHRRC|1.0|Russel Crowe is a good actor who up until movie-selected-good solid scripts.  What happened?  This moving is boring (even the high powered Wall Street type scenes are dull) and the characters are jerks.  The women are all bimbo types dying to get \\"shagged\\" by Max (Crowes' character) who thinks he's God's gift to women and the corporate world.  This is all supposed to be funny- yuk yuk.  Crowe's character is the epitome of disgusting corporate excess and ironically this movie and all its delight of corporate greed and excess was released about 2 months before the world economic crash.  A year or 2 after its release and this movie would be a glaring documentary about the shrill vulgarity of corporate greed.  It's not funny watching idiots like this-now.<br /><br />The bottom line is that movie just plain bad- that characters are all a bunch of dim-wit greedy jerks and it's not funny-really stupid idiotic type scenes.  I would not pay a dime to see this movie. I saw it free- on a plane traveling to Europe. Thank God.

I've seen the firm and know he's in the big leagues when it comes to author world, but this was the first book of his I've actually partaken of.  To be honest, I wasn't really that impressed.  I am the type of guy that will read a book just to finish it.  I started it, so I finished it.  It was never really too suspenseful or exciting.  I liked the ending, even though it seemed predictable.  I don't know- if this book didn't have John Grishams name on the front of it I have my doubts as to how far it would have gone.  It does make me want to read some of his other books though, just to see what they are like.  I gave it three stars.  It was right down the middle.  Not the best thing I've ever read, and not the worst.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|I had grave doubts that this movie would come off.  The subject matter, the life of J. Edgar Hoover, is notoriously complex and other attempts in the past to put it on the big, or the little, screen have not come off well.  Nor did I see how Dicaprio could pull off the role of J. Edgar Hoover.  It did not seem like a good fit to me.  However, I am glad to be wrong.  Dicapiro does a truly stellar job in the role of J. Edgar Hoover.  I quickly found myself forgetting that it was Dicaprio playing a role -- that was J. Edgar Hoover up on the screen.  The storyline in this film is very accurate as far as the facts go.  One inaccuracy, which I suppose Hollywood could not resist, was the notion that there was at least a tiny romantic spark between Hoover and Miss Helen Gandy, his personal assistant.  There is no factual basis for this assumption that I know of.<br /><br />My main criticism of the film is that it appears to focus overmuch on the relationship between Clyde Tolson and Hoover.  Tolson, of course, was Hoover's number two man at the Bureau and lifelong friend.  I am imagining that this film accurately depicts the relationship between the two men; many biographers agree with this film that the relationship between the two was more than friendship.  I simply thought that the film focused excessively on this aspect of Hoover's life rather than other more interesting aspects.  I would have liked to have seen even more depictions of Hoover blackmailing American politicians and exercising the unwholesome excessive power that he wielded in American political life for decades.  There is a fair amount of that in this film, but more would have been better.  Hoover's feud with the CIA is another avenue that could have been explored more. Just my opinion.<br /><br />This is a solid film that captures at least in part the life of a complex man who history is still in the process of judging.  Recommended.  RJB.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Hello,  the G13 is highly impressive gameboard.  I installed it the first time and all programs associated with it come with a visual display for each button and the gameboard itself makes remembering keys simple.  For example say you want the gameboard to be a quickly remember certain keys pressed; simply press the MR button the key you want on the gameboard then press the keys on your keyboard in the order you want (you can also make it record keys with delay such as pressing B for 3.04 seconds then K for 1.002 seconds)then by pressing MR again to finalize the keys pressed.  with key combinations you can also assign certain sentences to type with a single button like follow me or something like that.  the overall product is awesome the LCD screen is very cool however you can look for a youtube video on all the stuff it can do on the LCD (alot)

0525423656|5.0|I know. I'm so late at reading this but I didn't think i was going to read this because the first book wasn't as good. So I was thinking about not reading it but I was really curious. Match was really slow in the beginning and it was still slow through the rest of the book. I really do like the second book, it moves a lot faster. I'm totally going to read the third book. It left a big cliffhanger, my opinion. The book is tell in two points of view (Cassie and Ky)<br /><br />First Chapter: Well I read this a long time ago and I just picked it up a few days ago. I think it talked about how Ky was in a town and was trying to run away. Cassie was still with Xander. Cassie was planning on visiting Ky because she still loves him.<br /><br />The Love Triangle: Cassie said that she loves them (Xander and Ky) both for different reasons. She loves Xander because they're bestfriends. They are perfect together and they understand each other. Cassie loves Ky because Ky take her to different places. Ky makes her do stuff that she would never do. What do you think Cassie should choose?<br /><br />I love this book more then Matched a lot more. I hope you didn't quit on Matched because you have to read this! It's pretty good :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was lucky enough to get this app for free from Amazon (app of the day). I had been on the fence about purchasing it because I doubted it would work how it was advertised. Here was my opportunity to try it for free, and it has more than surpassed my expectations. I use it several times a week (from my Kindle Fire) to access my home computers when I am at work, or anywhere with wifi, and access my mother's computer to help her with her latest issue. This app is a must have!

1451627289|5.0|Yes, the love scenes between Jake and Sadie are a bit awkward, but the characters are rich and fully drawn, and the story is a wonderful feat of imagination and inspiration.  Best for me, as with \\"Insomnia\\" is when Steve unravels some of the mysteries of the alternate universe at the end of the story, with Jake achieving greater insight into the ripples and perils of trying to change the past.<br /><br />I listened to 11/22/63 on audio MP3 (3 disks instead of 40 on CD!) narrated by Craig Wasson, who contributes a strong performance, maintaining suspense and giving the characters depth and passion.

0545140323|5.0|I read one of her books before and it was sooooo goood! So i checked this out and I love this also. This is one of my favorite authors now. I can't wait to read one of her other books! I just love her writing and ideas. AHHHH! I just love it. You should go check out this author, if you haven't already :)<br /><br />First Chapter: Penny boyfriend is Nate and he was staying in her basement the whole time and her parents doesn't know. They've been doing things together since they were kids. One day, Penny was ready to 'do it'  with him. So she walks in her basement to see Nate but then she saw Nate laying with another girl and kissing her. So now she's sad and all.<br /><br />Then suddenly there's this couple who was dating for years and years and now they're not dating anymore. The girl was Penny's ex best friend and now she's running back to Penny because she has no one. Penny decided to make a club to not date anyone at high school.<br /><br />It's just sooooo amazing! Please do check it out :) I'm begging haha. I would tell you more stuff but I don't want to spoil anything.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I saw some negative reviews with people using this app on their Kindle Fire and wanted to say it works great on mine. I only watch videos in high quality picture and have never had a problem.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Yes, your read that right.  If Birding was Crack, my husband would be in jail, or more hopefully recovery.  But I doubt that recovery is possible.<br /><br />We saw this in the theater with about 25 members of a local birding organization.  I think five audience members were non-birders and they were fortunate to see it with the perfect audience.  (Akin to seeing a Star Trek movie with Trekkers)<br /><br />As you can imagine the audience thought the movie was great, and truthfully, unless you are a birder or associated with one, this film is great in ways you can't imagine.  That's how spot on this portrayal of the \\"sport\\" of birding is.  I am amazed at the level of accuracy in even the subtlest details.  At one point the boys cross paths looking for a rare humming bird, when they finally show the bird, it is in fact the real one the boys are supposedly looking for, not some glamorous dolled up Hollywood version of it's drab little self.<br /><br />Although it is certainly not necessary, the more you know about birding and birders the more deeply you will enjoy this film.  It is that thoughtfully made.  The portrayals of the spouses also cover the gamut of situations a significant other might reasonably expect, the trials of trying to find that one elusive bird for your list, the difficulty of financing your obsession and of course, having to deal with people who just don't get it.<br /><br />And yes, should word get out that you have a rare bird in your yard, folks will show up from miles away to see it.  We have been out to see a local rareity and have met people who drove from 500 miles away to see the same bird.  (See crack comment above.)<br /><br />The acting is superb, you can expect the best of Steve Martin, the usual understated charm of a Jack Black performance and Owen Wilson plays a shockingly good rich jerk.<br /><br />I think the filmmakers did justice to the joys a difficulties of this kind of quest (do you love your wife or birds?) for birders and for those who love them.  I agree with others who think this would be a great family film.  It's about something that is real.  The characters are not striving for money or popularity or to save the world.  Its about setting a goal others might think is a bit weird and then going all out to attain it for no other reward than having done it.  What's the harm in that?  None that I can see --unless watch the film and be come birders!!!!  Ahhhhhh.<br /><br />A great movie.
B00511PTWM|4.0|This worked as advertised for me. It seems solidly constructed, and its ratcheting swivel means it's \\"head\\" can be repositioned by a full 180 degrees. It has a threaded shaft with a collar that can be moved to fit vehicles with varying socket depths. The indicator light is bright enough, but not overpowering. It worked flawlessly for me.<br /><br />I had no problem finding the perfect angle in the two cars where I've used it, but it's larger than some similar devices so you might consider other options (such as units with receptacles on wires, instead of fixed) for very tight spaces.

B002ZG99CC|3.0|It's OK for kids I guess, but I expected something better. The best part of the movie was when Jackie Chan's character used a fly swatter to kill a fly.<br />It took me a while to figure out Dre was a boy and not a girl. He had dreadlocks, very good looking, etc. The end was predictable; even though Dre get pummeled, he gets up to win.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My family is captivated every time we watch one of the DVDs.  Our preschoolers love the videos; and ask lots of questions.

B004JMZWMG|4.0|For all the hardcore fans out there, this 2011 Sony Music Legacy addition comes with three bonus tracks on disc 2. They are recorded live, Indiana 24th January 1978:<br />9. Tank, 10. The Enemy God Dances....., and 11. Nutrocker. It is mastered by Andy Pearce (who I believe did the Shout factory version). I can't compare sound quality for I don't have all the previous editions, but this sounds fine to my ears. If you don't own this or are thinking about an upgrade, economically this would be the way to go. I'll leave the reviews of the music to those more eloquent than I.

B005EWDA3I|3.0|1Q84 is a novel by Haruki Murakami, split over three volumes. Books 1 and 2 were first published in Japan in 2009, with the third volume appearing the following year. All three volumes were published in English in 2011 - Books 1 and 2, translated by Jay Rubin, were published as a single volume, with the third - translated by Philip Gabriel - following a couple of weeks later. The title is nod to George Orwell's 1984; the letter Q in Japanese is (I'm told) pronounced the same way as the number 9.<br /><br />Where the action alternated between Aomame and Tengo in Books 1 and 2, they now share the spotlight with Ushikawa - who'd approached Tengo in Book 2, claiming to represent an arts body. It hadn't taken Tengo long to realise Ushikawa was connected to Sakigake in some way. Thanks to his starring role in Book 3, it's now clear he isn't an adherent but rather a hired PI. Following Leader's death, Tengo and Fuka-Eri are no longer his priority, and he's trying to track Aomame down. While he hasn't got a clue where she is - she spends the bulk of the book hiding in her safe house - he soon spots a connection between her and Tengo. So, with no other leads, he decides to stake out the budding young author...<br /><br />Tengo, meanwhile, has now taken a little time off work to spend with his father. (Not that he's suddenly become a model son - he's just hoping to see Aomame in the Air Chrysalis again). Fuka-Eri is now hiding out his flat alone, and he occasionally checks in with a phone call. Although Air Chrysalis has now disappeared from the bestsellers' list and Komatsu appears to have gone AWOL, the book still has its devoted fans. (Komatsu's absence is a little mysterious; the official line is that he's off sick, though neither Tengo nor Komatsu's colleagues are entirely convinced. For some reason, though, Tengo doesn't get overly concerned by his editor's absence).<br /><br />I couldn't help feeling there was something a little aimless about Books 1 and 2 - but, withBook 3 there seems to be more direction, an actual point to the storyline. The introduction of Ushikawa is probably what helped spur the story along, though I wouldn't rule out Jay Rubin's contribution either. Still, even with al the improvements, it's not entirely flawless either. I was baffled at how the Dowager, Komatsu and especially Fuka-Eri were dropped from the storyline. (Tengo's claim that he never felt any desire for Fuka-Eri was also laughable - even if their roll in the hay was beyond his control, he'd spent a ridiculous amount of time staring at her chest). Sakigake, a menacing presence in Books 1 and 2, were limp, weak and...well...polite by the end of Book 3. (I still have no idea what the Little People were up to, or what the point of the second moon was, for that matter). Still, if you've read Books 1 and 2 and enjoyed them, you'll not be disappointed with Book 3.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This thriller was obviously written for young adults, but the writing was so good that anyone would love it.  I read it straight through because it was so unusual and captivating.  Someone had given me the last book in the trilogy, but when I mentioned to my daughter that I had it, she told me to start with Hunger Games.  I did and then read the other two over the weekend.  Felt let down at the end.  I wanted more...Glad the movie is coming out this month.  Can't wait to see how the characters look and how the action is advanced.  The book is usually better than the film.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The Outlander series by Dianna Gabledon is incredible. It is based on an accidental time traveler with a medical background who travels back in time 200 years to Scotland. The adventures and LOVE STORY that unfold are wonderful. I am not one to read the same thing a second time but these books are so GREAT I have read the entire series (5 or 6 books) 3 times and have learned something new and exciting every time. If you like time travel you will love these books!
1451627289|3.0|King has been dumping in his own personal New Englander politics and propaganda spin in recent books.  Under the Dome was an environmentalist nutter's dream, for instance.  This Kennedy book is ripe with it.  I especially liked how he has his characters discuss the time portal and how it's too late to stop Hitler and too early to stop 911, he tosses in how it could be used to stop Bush winning Florida.  It's great that he equates Bush with Hitler and 911 (and spent a paragraph doing it).<br /><br />It's also bizzaro how he takes a shot at Texas culture like he does.  Called it a hateful rightwing place while warning against 'extremism'.  Sorry, but a Communist killed Kennedy, as much as he'd love it to be a sweaty son of the confederacy.  A socialist invaded Vietnam and let's not forget the Unabomber was an environmentalist (King's religion).  One clearly sees the hate in this book, King drips it with utter disdain for people that disagree with his politics.<br /><br />I also loved his overuse of racial politics.  He channeled too much Too Kill a Mockingbird in this one...  which made it a laughable cliche.  White liberals are the worst at this sort of propagandizing, when they make one race look completely pure and the other completely evil (except for the main character, whom the author sees himself as).  Tell you what, King, let's get more black folk up in Maine.  You only have 1%...  you guys must clearly be racist to have so few.  I call for affirmative action to get Maine's numbers up to the nations average of 13%.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Firstly, a sword of ice and fire is by far the best series I've ever read.  If you haven't read it yet, you should.  If you don't have time to read, the audio books by Roy Dotrice are spectacular.  I'm not going to go into too much storyline detail, I just want to debunk some of the \\"myths\\" that I've seen in other reviews.<br /><br />NB: I'm just going to get this out there, if you're very conservative, you're probably not going to enjoy this show (or at least you may not want your kids watching).  It's extremely graphic and is fraught with vulgar language.<br /><br />(1) This is NOT your standard HBO show.<br />  I'm not going to lie, when I first began the show (having not read the books yet), I saw a bunch of nudity and violence and heard a ton of cursing and thought: \\"Yep, standard hbo show.\\"  Luckily, I was so wrong. I hate when they just throw that stuff in to try to substitute for good, core quality.<br />  The writing is second to none. By far the best script I've ever seen for a TV show.  The crew did a fabulous job of remaining true to the text.  The first season almost perfectly parallels \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"  The fact is that this is a cruel, patriarchal world. There is a lot of murder, rape and death.  Yes, I see how some people would think that this series is inherently misogynistic, but those people probably also think that everyone in Iran is a terrorist.<br /><br />(2) The \\"bad guys\\" do NOT always win.<br />  Viewers/readers who think that the \\"bad guys\\" win seriously have no idea what they're talking about and have a complete misunderstanding of the characters.  A strikingly beautiful aspect of a sword of ice and fire lies in Martin's ability to craft characters who are NOT simply good or evil.  Almost all of the characters are extremely complex.  On top of that, the reader/viewer can identify with nearly all of the characters.  You'll hate some characters, but you'll understand and appreciate their motives.  Nearly all of the characters' gambits are calculated and sensible.  When someone does do something stupid, they tend to die (which makes sense).  There is so much manipulation in this series, I love it!<br /><br />(3) Some good things DO happen.<br />  While it's true that a lot of terrible things happen to nearly every character in this series, there are still plenty of wonderful things that happen, too.  Sometimes it can get depressing, but this is the nature of war, of the game of thrones, if you will.  On that note, Martin does kill off a lot of main characters (as the series progresses), but at the same time, he introduces tons more, too.  While it truly hurts when some of the characters die, it also makes a lot of sense that they do.  Martin is a master of progressing the plot.<br /><br />Unlike most other authors, Martin challenges the paradigms of story telling.  This is not a song of good/evil or hero/villain.  Things are rarely as they appear.  Nothing is simple. No one is safe.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|yesterday I got a legit version of this set off of craigslist for 70.00.  I wasn't ever planning on getting this, but for the price I figured why not.  I am halfway though the set and I must say I have to change my opinion of the Beatles.  After listening to this set, I can see why so many people do think they are one of the greatest bands and all of that<br />Not sure if I would pay 110 for it or more, but since i doubt it will go lower then 70, I feel happy with the price i paid =)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|After one of my 9th grade students kept raving about this novel, I finally decided to give it a try- I was soon raving about it too! This is definitely one of the best novels I've ever read, maybe THE best. I highly recommend it for anyone. It is suitable for all ages, middle school to senior adults.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I had seen the version of Rear Window that I recorded myself off the TV several times before finally getting the DVD. If the recorded version was great, of course the DVD was even better! I watched the special features and was intrigued by the comment about how all it really was was a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting... etc. The film was so compelling I had actually never realized it was that simple!<br /><br />Of course, there was a little more to it than that, such as Grace Kelly climbing fire escapes, the little dog sniffing the flower bed, the scenes in Jeff's apartment, and the final scene. But for the most part, that's all it was. And you know a movie is excellent when it keeps your attention for that long when it's simple dialogue, seemingly simple shots, and relatively few special effects. It must have actually been very difficult to film. Jimmy Stewart was actually reacting to NOTHING. And yet, each reaction had to be subtly different. What a challenge!<br /><br />I remember watching the movie Disturbia a few years ago. I couldn't watch it without thinking of this movie. I don't know if they intended it to be an homage to Rear Window or not. But I do know that I might have liked Disturbia if only I had never seen Rear Window!

B000IAZ5HK|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this dressing shaker. I always make my own dressing, and I usually have some left over and store it in the fridge for later use. In the past I would store it in a cup, or small tupperware, or something else non-ideal for serving it again. I've thought about getting some product to keep my dressing in before, but nothing I'd ever seen really seemed exactly right. Then I came across this one, and thought it looked nice and had the features I'd want. Sure enough, it is perfect. It is pretty, elegant, a fine addition to my dining table. It is very easy to fill, and the stopper fits & seals perfectly. It's easy to shake up the dressing before pouring. Best feature of all? The way the pouring spout is designed. Absolutely perfect way to evenly dispense exactly how much dressing you want. It shows off my dressings well, it stores them in the fridge, it's easy to use, and it serves perfectly. I was a little concerned about how delicate it seems - the glass feels quite thin. I thought it might get broken too easily. But we haven't been gentle with it, and I even subject it to some temperature change - I'll put it in hot water when I take it out of the fridge to get the oil in the dressing back to liquid form in time for dinner - I always forget to take it out of the fridge 'til the salad's on the table, oops! It's holding up just fine and I'm no longer worried at all.<br /><br />I just want to reiterate what was the best surprise for me of all - this thing pours dressing like a dream! I'll never go back to any other way to serve salad dressing.

0307888908|3.0|\\"no one's anybody\\" as the old Gilbert and Sullivan song goes...<br /><br />There is a lot of good advice here if you're a driven, intelligent, well connected, aspiring silicon valley executive.  (i knew Bill from Standford, so naturally when I was looking for financing...) But excuse me, how is starting a blog and creating a personal identity online going to help a blue collar worker who chose not to go to college in the first place because he lacked the cognitive ability and found his interests and skills lied elsewhere?  Is this even applicable to a graduate of a second rate state school with a nondescript degree?<br /><br />To expect an entire economy /workforce to behave like this is ridiculous.  This is the career version of 'home ownership will make everyone a millionaire\\".<br /><br />There is good advice about building a network , using linked in (which shouldn't be a surprise!) but using Hoffman's experience as a millionaire entrepreneur to model the career of the average worker is like a middle class married couple taking  finance advice a Wall Street Venture capitalist. These techniques and lifestyles don't transfer. How many people can treat their careers as \\"permanent beta' while raising kids, planning for savings, etc?<br /><br />There is a tacit endorsement of the 'new' ruthless economy where state governments and the elite completely justify their abuse of power/lack of compassion for the nation that made their success possible. The previous generation of great industrialists were not internationalist - (Henry Ford for example) and that is what made it possible for people like Hoffman to prosper, go to good schools, be raised in a high standard of living. Are the current elite doing the same? No. They are justifying their ruthless, narcissistic, selfish behavior by claiming it's inevitable and unstoppable, and of course that they are making 'the world' better.<br /><br />The speak about globalization as if its an enviable natural force, as opposed toa deliberate attempt to dismantle the nation state... and ironically..<br /><br />The nations that are 'winning' the game don't play by those rules. The Chinese are nationalistic, hire and protect their own... now who's winning the game of \\"globalization\\"?
B00004ZKVM|5.0|I had this tape a long time ago.  Lost it.  This is the best compilation ever.  Everything fits so well.  I was hoping to get a CD of the same.  I guess it was never made.  Too bad.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found that this third installment of The Hunger Games series was NOT disappointing! I couldn't imagine how the author could wrap all this up, but she did it beautifully. I'm already wishing for a fourth novel in this series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app works perfectly. different versions are included. the reading function works phenomenally, just like the kindle reader. has a bookmarks feature that turned out to be super useful. easy to look up specific passages. all in all great app.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This would be a perfect Blu-Ray if it was not the sound inconsistencies. I give 5 stars just for the Show including the wonderful music, and spectacular performance of the entire cast, 4.5 stars for the stunning picture, but only 4 stars for the sound, because it lacked dynamic and volume for the vocals that often got a very low level sound compared to the sound of the orchestra. A wonderful Show that was almost damaged by a mistaken sound engineering. Also, lacked best sound involvement, and even the stereo effect was poorly exploited by putting the whole orchestra at center stage, unless I choose to play stereo sound with Dolby PLIIx when, in this case, the sound is more dynamic and engaging. However, when I saw the \\"grand finale\\", all the criticisms that I made with respect to the sound does not seem so important. From this point the sound gets more dynamic and with more volume, and ends up enriching greatly the guest Sarah Brightman's participation in the presence of the current and old phantoms, and together they conclude the show with an  \\"grand, and exciting, finale\\". I just read a review from a Brazilian who complains about the errors from the lyrics of songs in Portuguese-BR subtitles. Yes, it is true, if someone tries to follow the direction of history with subtitles, the person will be confused and don't  will understand the correct meaning of the phrase. This shows total lack of knowledge of the translation work. A shocking example was the inexplicable reversal of  English word \\"masquerade\\" to \\"Carnaval\\" in the subtitles, and several other inexcusable mistakes revealed in the subtitles for the Portuguese-BR(Brazil). However, selecting subtitles for the Portuguese-PT(Portugal), I could see that another translator did his best work of translation, where I can not identify translation errors that could confuse the reader.

B004LWZW42|1.0|I watched this with a friend and afterwards was glad I didn't waste my money buying or even renting this movie.  If you are looking for any kind of comic book continuity then skip this movie.  There are so many things out of order in this movie I can't believe it was put into production.  Alex Summers exists in the 60's as a young adult (impossible), and yet Scott doesn't.?  I wasn't impressed with Kevin Bacon's portrayal of Sebastian Shaw or Sebastian's made up power to absorb explosions and energy to stay young.<br />  I won't bore you with all of the details of what I found wrong with this movie and why I wouldn't recommend watching it.  If it was set apart from the comic books then it would be passable to watch.  The special effects and action was good.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game its way fun its amazing how many things you can do. You should really check out this app
B005UBNKZG|5.0|So first let get this out of the way: This processor DOES work with Windows7.  What it doesn't get is full utilization of all 8 cores with it.  However, even with that, this sucker if freakin' *fast*.  My Windows Experience Index is at 7.5 for the CPU, and that's without overclocking it.  Which brings me to another topic- AMD chips have always been good with overclocking, and from all reports i've seen, this one is rock solid.  I've modestly upped it to 3.4 ghz so it can run at effectively the same speed as the FX 8150, and it's good so far.<br /><br />The other thing about it that Windows 8 *does* take advantage of its architecture and reports are that there will be at least a 10% boost in performance with Win8.  Normally, when you go up an OS, your computer's hardware needs to be updated.  With this CPU, you won't have to- in fact, your PC will be even faster!<br /><br />So if you plan on upgrading a PC every year or 2, this CPU won't be the best deal for you.  You can get a Phenom II for $50 less to get the same performance out of Win7. But if you want it to last you 4, 5, 6 years, this one should work nicely.<br /><br />UPDATE on 11/16/12: I've actually been running this CPU at 4.2GHz for about 6 months now. That's about the limit i've been able to get on air cooling.  It's been very stable and really fast, cannot complain at all!<br /><br />Also, i have 2 sticks of 4GB G.Skill Sniper series 1866MHz RAM.  I've seen some people concerned that you can't actually get ram to run at higher than 1600. First of all, some of those folks used 1600 ram, not 1866.  Second, you DO need to most likely tweak your BIOS to run them at that speed regardless.  My asus sabertooth 990fx motherboard would only look at my ram as 1600 by default, but a few quick settings changes in the BIOS fixed it.  You have to manually set the timings per spec and it will work just fine.

0316067598|5.0|I just finished reading Lone Survivor and I highly recommend this book for anybody interested in a behind the scenes glimpse of the Navy Seals.  We all understand the dynamics of the media during war and I think the author does a great job with a candid response to how media affects the solider.  The book is well written and explores a great deal of of the fabled SEAL training.  In fact, the actual account of the operation doesn't start until around half way through the book, so the first part is a lot of the author's history and training (which was just as important to the story as the actual account of Operation Redwing).<br /><br />I've never read a book as quickly as I have Lone Survivor, which speaks volume of the content and readability of this book.  I can not even begin to express the honor I give to the brave men who are chronicled here.  Their heroism in the line of fire is a testimony to our armed forces, and this great country!
0307593312|5.0|Overblown?  Yes.  Repetitive?  Often.  Lacking in unity?  Indeed.  But something about _1Q84_ keeps even the most critical readers engaged.  Even its most scathing review betrays its reviewers' engagement with the text.  \\"It sucks.  I want to stop reading, but I can't,\\" sums up most negative reviews of this novel; and often, \\"I can't stop reading in spite of myself\\" will translate to, \\"It was misunderstood in its time, but I always loved it\\" twenty years from now.<br /><br />While this novel may lack the unity of a _Kafka on the Shore_ or the variety of a _Hard-Boiled Wonderland_, it is certainly a relief after some dreadfully forgettable works like _After Dark_.  It has its own charms.  Remember that lonely, painfully isolated feeling you felt while reading the last few chapters of _A Wild Sheep Chase_?  Imagine this tone extended to novel-length.  Murakami wants us to feel what the characters feel, their desperate separation.  Forced to define themselves by the mundane details of everyday life, they are grasping at hope or fear in any little change.  We begin to feel that we are in forced isolation as well, confused about our identities, completely separate from each other, and prepared to accept almost anything as truth while longing for meaning and permanence.  There is more reality here than in perhaps any other work by this author.  When Aomame sits on her balcony, night after night, with her hot cocoa, we see ourselves, and we realize that we are just as alone, just as desperately seeking some uncertain thing.<br /><br />The novel is often self-referencing.  Referring to a childhood acquaintance who would carve rats out of wood, Tamaru, a supporting character, says, \\"He often used to say that: 'I'm going to pull the rat out.'  And the rats he *pulled out* looked as if they might start moving at any moment.  He kept on freeing these imaginary rats that were locked up in their blocks of wood.\\"  Who can doubt that Murakami is referring to himself as author?  It brings to mind an interview in which he describes his own stories as \\"weird.\\"  POSSIBLE SPOILER: Likewise, the one most valuable item Tengo takes with him at the end of the book is his manuscript.  It would be a stretch to claim that the novel is semi-autobiographical, of course, but there are many places in which the novel alludes candidly to the role of the artist or writer.<br /><br />Charles Dickens' _Great Expectations_ was initially panned for its lack of unity, interminable plot (or lack thereof), and unsatisfying resolution; now it is considered one of his greatest works.  Murakami achieves something in _1Q84_ that his loyal readers may not expect; but I think if we are prepared to accept it, we will find something very worthwhile.  In short, I enjoyed this book; and, more than 'enjoy', I appreciated it.brings to mind an interview in which he describes his own stories as \\"weird.\\"  POSSIBLE SPOILER: Likewise, the one most valuable item Tengo takes with him at the end of the book is his manuscript.

006197806X|4.0|As soon as I read the last of Lauren Oliver's Delirium, I knew I'd be buying the next in the series.  The cliffhanger-esque ending of that book left many a reader gasping and clutching at the pages, asking Why why why it had to be that way.  So, yes, I had high hopes for this book.  Often, when hopes are so high, they get dashed. Thankfully that was not the case in this instance and Pandemonium delivered a punch that, while it isn't quite as breath-stealing as the first in the series, definitely got my attention.<br /><br />I admit that initially I was a little put off by the format.  The chapters alternate from \\"now\\" to \\"then\\", and I really expected it to be choppy and vile.  Ms. Oliver, though, pulled it off without a hitch and I feel like the story flowed well enough forward that the pauses to shift back to the past did not leave it feeling disjointed at all.<br /><br />I did miss some of the characters from Delirium, and I didn't really bond so much with some of the new ones introduced in Pandemonium, but I'm fairly certain that was by design and not because they're badly written characters. Quite the opposite in fact - everyone introduced to the reader seemed well thought out and placed intentionally.<br /><br />There -are- a few little things in Pandemonium that I feel were thrown in there just because they could be thrown in. Also, the story itself felt a bit less substantial than Delirium. There was just as much world building and we do get to see why things are happening the way they're happening, but it just wasn't portrayed in as succinct (and yet perfectly detailed) a way as the first book. In that respect, this book definitely has a middle-of-the-series funk to it.  It's not overwhelming, though, and certainly shouldn't cause anyone to not read through.  And really, despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the time between the end of Delirium and the \\"now\\" of Pandemonium. Lena's life went from innocent and mostly carefree to epic and hard, and she GREW from it.  She developed, learned, fought, feared, loved, and became a deep character with many layers.<br /><br />Now - the ending.  Hmm.  I have so many mixed emotions about how this book ended.  In one way, you're surprised - but it's also kind of expected. It really kind of boggled my mind that it ended the way it did.<br /><br />Pandemonium is a beautiful story that explores the growth of self through trial and heartache and introduces the reader to the flux of emotions that can happen with all of the relationships in a person's life.<br /><br />I'll definitely be reading Requiem, the third in the series.he GREW from it.

B002IFT1ZA|3.0|I'm not to sure why consumers at Amazon and critics on the net are giving the series such glowing reviews.<br />The acting is really a mixed bag. Yes, there are some outstanding performances by some of the leading actors:<br />Mark Addy is terrific in the role of Robert Baratheon, a once heroic king who has become overweight and buffoonish in middle age and is plagued by an unhappy marriage. Maisie Williams, who plays my favorite character in the books, Arya, is an absolute scene stealer -- she is exactly how I envisioned the character of Arya, scrappy and adorable with those huge eyes of hers. And of course Peter Dinklage is terrific as Tyrion Lannister, the deformed but cunning black sheep of the Lannister family. There are also some reasonably good performances from Michele Fairley (Catelyn Stark), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Richard Madden (Robb Stark) and Emilia Clarke (Danys Targearean). Unfortunatley, thats were the good performances end, and we haven't quite covered all the main characters yet. I'm not sure what happened to Sean Bean since the Lord of the Rings, but whatever happened, it isnt good. He looks old, tired, and distracted in the role of Ned Stark. He is not able to hold is own in scenes with Robert Baratheon (and he is supposed to be the great King's most trusted and loyal ally), he cannot hold is own is scenes with his wife, Catelyn Stark. I'm as big a fan of Sean Bean as there is -- I loved him in the Tom Clancy movie Patriot Games, and he was great as Boromir in LOTOR, but wow was he miscast for this series. Another huge letdown is Lena Headley as Cersei Lannister. Headley is a magnificent looking woman, as Cersei is in the books, but that's where the resemblance ends. Were Cersei is cruel, calculating and fiendishly cunning in the series, Headley actually has this strange look of COMPASSION (of all things) in her eyes most of the time. And where Cersei is a force of nature in the books, screaming and cursing her contempt at wretched brother Tyrion, or arduously flirting with her beloved brother Jaime, Headly is a drooping lilly in this series -- her voice is barely above a whisper most of the time! She gets overwhelmed in scenes with Mark Addy, Peter Dinklage, even Michele Fairley as Catelyn Stark proves too much for her. The same criticism applies to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the role of Jaime Lannister. Again, Nikolaj looks the part of Jaime, handsome and roguish. But where Jaime is a dashing, daring, risk-seeking warrior in the books, Nikolaj comes across as some stuffy academic, more comfortable poring over tomes in some library by his lonesome rather than baring steel on the battlefield.<br />I would recommnend a viewing if you are a fan of the books, but, as a result of some of the tepid performances by some of the cast members, dont expect many repeat viewings!Tyrion, or arduously flirting with her beloved brother Jaime, Headly is a drooping lilly in this series -- her voice is barely above a whisper most of the time!

She gets into so many challenges, issues, problems, and more problems -lol- that she manages to take care of herself, for half the time.

B0052U59F4|2.0|I'm not sure what all the hype is about over this series.  The books are not well written, incredibly repetitive, there is little character development, and the sex scenes are, well, vanilla.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|...I finished this series.  While I think it was a good story, I also think that it could have been abbreviated, perhaps by an entire book.  I think that there were unnecessary (and distracting) details that made completing this series difficult at times.  Perhaps it was lost in translation?  With that said, Salander is a perfect heroine, and I enjoyed the closure (but perhaps the closure was more enjoyed due to conquering the feat of finishing this series, after investing so much time in it!)

B00005J6T1|4.0|On her debut, Madonna choose to portray a naive, happy go lucky party girl who just wants to dance. But multiple layers exist on this record, and hints of the potential for longevity and cheeky intellect she had within her are more than evident, if one cares to look. This record isn't as lewd as Like a virgin, though she does put her foot in the door in terms of sparking controversy. For example, she wears crosses on her ears while writhing on the dance floor in \\"lucky star\\", and declares in \\"burning up\\" that unlike other pop stars that might come and go \\"she's not the same, she has no shame\\". Clearly. This strikes the listener as a test run for her, before her first big home run on Like A Virgin, though it's also one of her least pretentious releases. And while she lacks the vocal ability of Aretha Franklin or Annie Lennox, she more than makes up for it with her raw determination. Listen to this record and you can hear the hunger in her voice, something she seems to lack on later recordings.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games to choose from, that there is always one to entertain you! love that you &quot;earn&quot; more games, keeps you wanting to play and master each one!
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Johnny Depp movies. He really shows off his acting chops in this movie. He makes his character so likeable. Let's not forget the rest of the cast. Everyone is great that is what makes this movie so good. You can tell they had alot of fun filming this movie.
B0011Z52EW|4.0|Gotta love My Chemical Romance! They keep getting better and better! This really is a great song. I totally recommend it.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|My Fair Lady is, as some critics have argued, perhaps the perfect musical. Admirers of Andrew Lloyd Webber (of which I am one, btw) may quibble, but to me this was the pinnacle of Broadway fare; a high bar from the standpoint of songs, book, and character, not to mention overall wit. Of course, with George Bernard Shaw supplying your source material, it's difficult to go wrong (though it has been known to happen: see the film The Millionairess, for example).<br /><br />The production values for this were stellar, as was the cast -- in particular Harrison and Hepburn. As good as Marni Nixon's voice is in dubbing for Hepburn, it's a pity they didn't allow her to sing. I've heard some of her tracks, and they were perfectly passable. Purists will disagree, of course, but if Harrison could be allowed to talk through his songs, the least they could have done was allow Audrey to sing hers.<br /><br />An extra bit: Check out the original London stage recording with Julie Andrews, the first Eliza. It's a beautiful, sometimes breathtaking album, wherein Andrews reaches perfection herself.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|Bird watching seems like a pretty flimsy excuse for a comedy but basically it's just a platform for these 3 stars to just be slightly sillier versions of themselves.  Steve Martin, in particular, benefits from having proven comedic talents to bounce off of. I had given up on him.  You can take this movie on a very superficial level or you can think about how a hobby or competitive drive can enrich your life or destroy it.  I also like the theme of diversity in both animals and landscapes.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|The 3D is fantastic. All my kids loved it and so did we. Our entire family loves the Shrek movie and have all of them in 3D as well and they all look great. Puss in Boots looks better though and the fur is unbelievable. They did a wonderful job on this film. Must own if you have a 3D tv.

0439023513|1.0|Well I read all three books in about four days. I figured that everyone is talking about the Hunger Games before the movie comes out that I should probably read the book first. While Collins has a written voice I'm not terribly fond of, I did love book 1. Book 2 was pretty good as well. But this book was a disaster imo.<br /><br />The problems were numerous.<br />1. Since Collins can't kill off the Big 3(Katniss, Gale, or Peeta) anywhere except the end, but lots of people need to die, she resorts to a cheap tactic. She introduces us to lots of new characters (a few from book 2) and then proceeds to rapidly kill them off.<br /><br />2. The depiction of the war is contrived and doesn't end in any realistic way.<br /><br />3. Lots of showing and not telling. Huge parts of the book were just boring.<br /><br />4. The description of the Capitol as a big arena with lots of 'pods' for gamemaker/defenders to use reminded me of a couple Dr. Who episodes and Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest. It was just silly -- a street that is really a trapdoor to a cavern of man-eating monsters/mutts. Please. It was insulting to me as a reader.<br /><br />5. Katniss' mom is an afterthought and Prim, a 14 year old girl, is thrust onto the very front lines of the Capitol invasion. It seemed very arbitrary.<br /><br />6. The whole 'let's go kill Snow' storyline was pointless and seemed like a vehicle for Collins to kill off the largest number of characters.<br /><br />7. The reasons for the assassination of Coin were left unexplained and the reader needed to infer everything. The aftermath was also totally unreal.<br /><br />Most wars take years to play out, but in Collins world the Capitol crumpled relatively quickly. Plus the fact that the war was between two nuclear powers (the Capitol & District 13) is brushed aside. The Capitol & District 2 against Every other district & District 13. The use of nuclear weapons is removed by her statement along the lines of 'we'll fight it out the old fashioned way on the ground so no one uses those terrible weapons.' Uh ok.<br /><br />In reality, the Capitol would have used their advanced weapons since the alternative was mass executions by the victors. Also, the Capitol apparently has vast abilities to manipulate DNA and other genetic technology, but no mention of use of biological weapons was made. Finally in book one it's mentioned that one reason the Capitol won the first rebellion was because the rebels had to scale the mountains to reach the capitol and were picked off from the air. In book three they just walk up the train tracks under the mountain. Why didn't the capitol just BLOW THE TUNNELS UP.<br /><br />Then we get to the whole 'The capitol is just a huge arena' nonsense. So in the 75 years since the first hunger games the capitol just decided to make the city a big arena. Yea right.<br /><br />Finally the book was just boring too often with extensive exposition. It just wasn't enjoyable to read like the first or second book.<br /><br />I didn't expect a fairytale ending, but I did expect some realism. The street trapdoor to the bugs of death at the very end was just the last insult I could bear.<br /><br />A very weak book. If they actually go ahead and make a movie out of it they'll have to practically re-write it.way on the ground so no one uses those terrible weapons.'

1416596585|3.0|This is a biography of Google based on more than 200 interviews with past and present employees. It covers the founding of the company and its development until 2011. The book describes technological innovations as well as the culture of Google.<br /><br />While I found the book easy to read and interesting it has several problems in my opinion:<br /><br />- The book is fanboy'ish in its tone. The author is clearly deeply impressed by Google and although he occasionally tries to present an opposing view, the author seems rather star-struck as Google is continuously being presented as if it is the sole champion of high-tech. Microsoft is being described as some kind of archaic dinosaur about to go extinct and IBM is hardly ever mentioned, etc.<br /><br />- Large parts of the book describe battles Google has had concerning privacy and copyright issues. In my opinion, these discussions are much too long as they're not that interesting compared to other aspects of the Google story.<br /><br />- The book is maybe 95% of the author's words and 5% quotes. I don't understand why biographers think their words are more interesting than those of their subjects. Whenever there was a quote from e.g. Page or Brin, it was vastly more informative about the way they think and act than several pages of the biographer's words.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to be mediocre.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|I have seen the series as it aired on HBO, and watched it 3 times (going on the 4th with the DVD release) on TIVO.  I am not arguing the series is bad or full of filth or the like, I mean the books were more descriptive then the show was.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed it seems that some scenes were removed from the DVD release.  Now granted this could be due to me remembering when things happened, but one example, the assassin at Winterfell, I could have sworn that happen in episode 2 but I didn't see it on the DVD release.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This was a incredible movie! The look of the film was awesome. Can't wait for the sequel! Blu ray looks great!
B0036T32LQ|5.0|The thing I loved about this kind of movie is that it is not purposefully made hard to understand. While you do get the point of the movie (or the feeling of what's going to happen next), it keeps you hopeful for some kind of character breakthrough. The director/writer/producer did not make the plot convoluted and heavy like many of these types of movies. They simply told the story of a horrible day. It's not dumbed down in any sense nor is it so abstract that only hardcore film students would understand. One of the better psychological thrillers I've seen a while!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts Is the best game I will ever play I am defiently keeping this game and I'm not going to delete the game and I would always recommend Going Nuts to my friends and keep trying to get as much nuts as I can and if you review Going Nuts you get 5 nuts and you really need them when you first start which you could really use and save IT TRUST ME!!!

B005OCFHHK|2.0|Ordered this as a Christmas Gift and apparently we should have just watched all the freaking movies immediately, despite schedules that wouldn't allow, because the last two DO NOT WORK and when I filed a complaint the seller prettymuch told me that my beef was with the manufacturer and not them. Extremely irritated and disappointed. What a waste of money.
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is a beautiful looking movie. Even with 3d glasses on the colors still look bright. The 3d added alot of depth to the movie and it really worked well and drew you into the movie. I like this one a little more the Lion King the depth just lookes better to me. Don't get me wrong I loved the Lion King in 3D to, and it is also beautiful especially on my 51 inch 1080p tv.

B004P2CQM4|1.0|Hello people of the world.  I am writing this today to tell you how completely and utterly unsatisfying this toy was!  I can't even begin to describe how upset I was when it popped after filling it up with the appropriate amount of helium.  I mean, I spent almost a hundred dollars on this toy for my son for Christmas (including shipping and helium) and we didn't even get to use it once! I filled it and set it up just as the instructions said.  And then the big bang.  It just exploded and nearly blew out my ear drums.  So if you have any common sense at all please don't buy this product save your money for something useful like a trip to a Hot Spring in Singapore.  Have fun, hope this was a informational review!:) If you do buy this and it pops, I promise I won't say I told you so but they did refund my money, and with the rest of the helium, you can use it for a birthday party.

B006UG909U|5.0|I've been a VH fan since I was 10 years old.  I got VH 1 & 2 on 8 Track from Columbia House and was hooked thereafter.  When Dave exited in 1985, I lost all interest in the band.  I watched from the sidelines as Sammy Hagar was inserted into the front man slot and they soldered on without Dave.  I will say it now -- I am NOT a Van Hagar fan (and I am also not a Dave solo fan either).  Don't take this as a Sammy attack -- I like his Montrose work and a couple of singles he did before hooking up with VH.  I just didn't like him taking over as the front man for \\"my\\" band.  That said, I did like 2 or maybe 3 of Sammy Halen's tracks over the years but not enough to buy a CD or a concert ticket.  Their 'Sammy' body of work was too soft with keyboards and pianos and \\"chick\\" lyrics.  What the hell happened to VH being a ROCK band?!?  With Dave at the helm, VH was about carnage, guitar Gods, and some of the heaviest rock anthems ever.  When VH reformed with Dave I was ecstatic.  I was hoping for a new album to support a tour but it didn't come.  I am not sure why, but I passed on seeing VH back in 2008 when they toured with Dave the first time.  I had seen concert footage and had heard audio from the shows and for whatever reason, decided not to go.  Fast forward to 2011 and the internet was a buzz with rumors of a new VH album.  Slowly, things started to leak out and then Tattoo was released.  While I thought the track was ok, I was underwhelmed with it.  Perhaps it was the crappy video that accompanied it, I am not sure.  There was a fan made video that was 1000% better and is along the lines of what the boys should have released.  Shortly afterwards, snippets of the rest of the album were leaked out and I listened like a 12 year old fan boy to every one with expectations off of the radar.  After listen to each of the 30 second or so snippets of the new tracks I was left thinking \\"WTF!?!\\".  I was crushed.  I kept thinking that this was another \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\" type of album -- the boys couldn't pick up from where they left off.  This wasn't a Fair Warning or 1984 for the new millennium, it was ... horrible - I hated what I was hearing.  Perhaps I expected too much.  Almost 30 years of wanting to see Dave and Ed back together I think clouded my thinking.  I was expecting a new \\"Hear About It Later\\" or \\"Unchained\\" and I wasn't hearing it.  Perhaps it was listening to snippets of the songs and not the complete tracks.  Maybe it had to do with listening to it though my crappy PC speakers, I really don't know but what I did know was that I couldn't stand what I was hearing and I didn't buy the album when it was released.  My birthday was a few weeks ago and my young daughters were looking for something to get Dad.  I told my wife that even though I didn't think I wanted it, the new VH album was getting fairly solid reviews online and that perhaps the girls should get it for me for my B-day as maybe I missed something by only listening to those snippets of the songs.  I figured worse case scenario, they were out $10.  I have a long car trip to/from work every day so I saved listening to the CD until the next day when I went to the office.  I don't know what happened from the time I heard the 30 second snips of the songs on the internet to the time I put the CD into my car stereo, but it was a night and day experience.  Just like every other \\"old\\" VH album, I love probably 90% of the songs on the disc.  The ones I don't like are still listenable but if given the option, I will just skip past them (on ADKOT, those tracks would be Tattoo since I've heard it a bunch of times already and Chinatown).  Everything else on the disc I can't seem to get enough of.  I've had the CD for a couple of weeks now and have not taken it out of the CD player.  It gets a full listen twice a day (going to and from work).  Don't misunderstand, this is not 1980's VH -- 3/4 of the band are approaching AARP membership age.  This is however, the hands down best rock \\"comeback\\" release ever.  It seems bands who release albums late in their career never find the mojo that brought them fame in their earlier days.  The Rolling Stones, Page/Plant, etc have done nothing close to this in their later years.  VH, even though they should be gearing down for retirement and social security still have it -- they can still rock and rock hard.  Sure, Dave's voice isn't what it used to be but it still sounds leaps and bounds better than Robert Plant's voice does these days.  I am a huge Zeppelin fan, but I can't being myself to listen to anything Plant releases since his Now and Zen period.  His voice is shot.  Dave's is still in great form.  This is just a good, fun, pure hard rock album with no gimmicks (cordless drills on the pickups anyone?).  Does it please everyone?  Probably not but it's well worth a listen to with the volume cranked and no expectations on what you will hear.  I can't wait to see them from the 11th row in a few weeks.  Game on boys.  Thanks for making one for the books -- job well done.

1400079144|1.0|I finish every book that I start. Unfortunately, this one was really hard to finish, not due to its depth of content, or it being a \\"difficult\\" book in any way, but because it was so unbelievably BORING and BADLY WRITTEN! It's full of stupid cliffhangers that really don't make it more interesting or appealing in any way. The characters are lacking in depth and the dialogues are as fake as Monopoly bills. And I'm nowhere near the plot yet! Predictable is not enough to describe it, and after a hundred pages I already had a pretty good guess of the ending. All in all, a complete waste of time.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I received a copy of this book from the author through a twitter giveaway, and I must say...very good read! I got my copy 3 days ago and I've already read it.

I'm also going to buy a paperback copy as well(I hate not having something tangible that I can hold in my hand !)<br /><br />Please consider giving Rebecca Hamilton's book a read, I'm sure that if you're a big urban fantasy fan you'll appreciate this story.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|When releasing an album in today's market (especially in an age where iTunes/Rhapsody/Amazon make up bulk sales & piracy can diminish numbers, proper marketing and strategy is EVERYTHING. Even when a singer or an album's material seems like gold, if the material isn't properly released, it can make a large difference between massive success and underperforming flops. Take the current talk of the town Adele. Sure her album is amazing and she's been winning awards left and right, but take into consideration how different her level of success would be had Rolling In The Deep not been released or music videos weren't being put out? Since that's the song that largely propelled her into worldwide acclaim, it could have kept her just under the radar. Such is the case with Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\". Let's point out the right moves that were made.<br /><br />--Born this Way being released as the first single & also being massively promoted on iTunes/youtube months before the album's release [Hype = word of mouth=imminent success]<br />-- Fantastic music videos [Keeps the song fresh in your mind & tends to keep a single's success afloat for weeks]<br />--diverse television performances of album material directed at different audiences [Any live performances are a great opportunity to prove your vocal chops and/or visual appeal]<br />-- amazon's 99c deal [This has been compared to basically saying the album was nearly a giveaway, but what better way to grab a new audience than by letting them hear your material for next to nothing?]<br /><br />All the above factors contributed to Gaga's incredible 1.1 million opening week sales & allowed her to go [as of 2/28/12]  8x platinum worldwide in less than a year.  However, not every decision an artist makes is for the best and can sometimes set them back instead of allowing them to prosper; for this album here were some of these moments:<br /><br />--releasing Judas as a single when other songs had better radio/video/sales appeal (Americano, Hair, Schiesse, Fashion of His Love)<br />--amazon's 99c deal (both a blessing and a curse)...while effective for reasons above, it also diminishes the value of her work in some people's perspective and makes it appear as if she isn't capable of maintaining an audience without giveaways<br />--placing too much material on one album .... while I liked most of the material, 17 songs & 5 remixes on one album is serious overkill, save some for a later release or a \\"unreleased/b-sides\\" album. Makes the album appear cluttered & messy. Less is always more.<br /><br />This is just my opinion from a music label perspective of how if the album had been better managed, it might have sold much better. I am a large Gaga fan and love the album, but I'd figured i'd add some insight. Let me know what you think!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Disney's \\"John Carter\\" movie is based on Edgar Rice Burrough's classic story \\"A Princess of Mars\\" which introduced me to the science fiction genre and made me a fan for life.  This story is very character-driven, the main characters being John Carter, Tars Tarkas and Princess Dejah Thoris.<br /><br />This story deals with John Carter, a disillusioned Civil War veteran who is mysteriously transported to Barsoom (Mars), which is dying and slowly losing its atmosphere and water.  When John arrives on Mars he immediately notices that he has greater strength and can jump huge distances.  The world he has entered is in the middle of a civil war between Helium and Zodang, which is secretly aided by the Therns (White Martians).<br /><br />Every side in this conflict wants John to aid them but he refuses to become part of it until he sees what is happening here and turns the tables on the plotters.  The movie does true justice to Edgar Rice Burroughs' vision of the Red Planet`s creatures, cities, air ships and terrain, by delivering a stunning vision of Mars.<br /><br />The John Carter of Mars is truly a great movie with great heroes and a great villain Matai Shang, who is the leader of the evil Therns (White Martians) of Barsoom (Mars).  This movie is well worth the price of admission.

006197806X|4.0|Yay! Another strong showing for Ms Oliver!  Although PANDEMONIUM wasn't quite as captivating a read as DELIRIUM (one of my very favorite novels of 2011), it still proved to be a very strong second installment in this gripping trilogy.<br /><br />I know that some readers have expressed distaste for the Now and Then chapter breakdowns, but I actually rather liked the parallel time lines.  For me, Oliver's choice to unfold Lena's current story as an Invalid on a mission for the Resistance; alongside her history in the Wilds, of what happen just after she crossed the border, was genius and expertly executed. Really my only complaint was that PANDEMONIUM started off a bit slower that I would have liked. It took a bit to get back into the story, where as DELIRIUM blew me away from start to finish.  But once things started to happen, Oliver had me until the end. And what an end it was! I do admit that the cliffhanger isn't a huge surprise... I mean I kinda knew that was where the story was headed, it was really the only \\"right\\" place it could go, but I sure enjoyed the ride. And with all this build up and tension (by the last page you can almost feel the electricity in the air) the third book promises to be epic!

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Take Shelter is a movie about the apocalypse...the apocalype of mental illness, its affect on those you love, and the stigma society places on those who suffer. The question throughout the movie is whether the man character's nightmares are a warning of things to come, or a reflection of his deteriorating mental state. I thought the acting was first rate, especially the relationship between the husband and wife. However, the movie does move at a slow pace and demands patience from the audience. in the final analysis, I found Take Shelter to be an all-around great example of storytelling thanks to great directing, a well-crafted screenplay, and tremendous acting.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I went into this movie fearing that all the funny parts were in the trailer. Quite a few were, but I didn't care. This movie is a great reversal of the typical horror movie plot line. I laughed out loud a number of times, and seeing the setup and aftermath of some of the scenes from the trailer made this movie even funnier. If you like horror movies, you'll love this movie. If you don't like horror movies, I'd still recommend this. It's that funny.

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I have been a Bruce Springsteen fan since 1978. I have bought every album he has put out within a day or 2 of the release date. I always liked to say that Bruce is the only artist that I like that, in my opinion, has never released an album that is less than very good. Yes, I liked every single one of them - Human Touch, Tom Joad, Working On A Dream, Magic. Pick your least favorite and I will defend it. Every single one had a bunch of songs that seriously moved me. A new release from Bruce would be in my 8-track, turntable, cd player, ipod for months.<br /><br />Well, not this week. Wrecking Ball is a bad Bruce album. I never thought there could be one of those, but this is it.<br /><br />It's not that I have a problem with the choice of musicians and that I long for another E Street Band album. The musicianship is fine.<br /><br />It's not that I have a problem with the subject matter or Bruce's politics or his ramped up spirituality (which I like actually) or the fact that people say Bruce is angry. I'm fine with all of that.<br /><br />I have a problem with the songs. They are boring, non-moving, and forced. This is an album filled with filler. I've listened to them a lot this week and I have no desire to hear Jack Of All Trades, Death To My Hometown, You've Got It (which is way too similar to Terry's song), or the horrible gimmicky title track (sorry, the lyrics will not let me separate it from Giants Stadium). Some of these songs are unintentionally funny to me - over the top breast beating and self indulgence. Not to mention ridiculous lyrics about fat cats on banker's hill. I laugh out loud at the forced drama. And I've been through some bad times, was out of work for a year not that long ago. Maybe my opinion will change as I listen more but I doubt it, since I really don't want to give this another spin.<br /><br />I give the cd 2 star for a few songs that I think are very good - Land Of Hope And Dreams, We Take Care Of Our Own and Swallowed Up (which is abonus track on the deluxe edition).<br /><br />Did someone is Springsteen's camp actually call Wrecking Ball \\"his best\\"? Seriously?? Do I actually have to type out the names of these albums - Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge Of Town, The Wild The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle. Does the best song on Wrecking Ball compare to the worst song on these 3? Did Rolling Stone magazine actually give this 5 stars? Five Stars?? I am bemused.<br /><br />Maybe it's me. Is it possible that after 34 years I have just grown tired of Bruce? Maybe, but I doubt it. All the amazon reviewers and Rolling Stone who gave this 5 stars - let's see how you feel about this cd next year compared to your other 5-star Bruce cd's.
1451683405|5.0|There is nothing in this book I don't already know. However, reading it puts an exclamation point on it all. I'm not happy about the fact that I don't have free will and I'd prefer to not think about it. Harris makes this impossible, so be careful. 5 stars because Harris is a genius and he did what he set out to do. The free will issue is a big issue, and this is the only book you'll ever need on the subject.

I wanted to experience the expression within her music today. And it's a beautiful expression. This album sinks right into my skin warming my heart like a favorite blanket. It's a wonderful accomplishment and I'm glad I bought it.

0553801473|5.0|The 5th installment of my favorite book series, this book was a great read! All I wanted to do was sit and read it cover to cover. The chapters done in the POV of different characters really helps the reader experience the story from all different angles. I recommend it to anyone out there looking for a good series to get wrapped up in.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Amazing! Hard to Describe.  The first 20 minutes are a bit slow, but stay with it.  It looks like most of the movie was shot with old Super 8 film.  But stay with it!  It gets better & faster, then better & faster, then better & faster!  Fascinating insight into the life of Senna.  I have been a casual viewer of F1 for over 20 years, but have not followed it closely.  I remember when Senna died and I remember the outpouring of emotion and never really understood why.  Now I do.  Watch it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it.  Couldn't put it down, cried at the end.  These books were so good, and I was pleasantly surprised especially knowing when I started the series, they were YA books.  Recommended them to several of my friends who are loving them as well.  Can't wait for the movie later this month.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a mother with a son in prison I found this book particularly heart wrenching. It is seldom that you hear the story from the side of the parents of the attacker. Denial . Acceptance. Denial.  Grief.  Anger.  Just wanting your normal life back but knowing it will never be the same.

I'm particular fond of the various characters especially the young ladies, Celia and Isobel.  I have not finished the book yet but do look forward to meeting with my club members and discussing my views.  Trena
B003O86FMW|4.0|I know its a 2nd book and not chapter, but it was the start of a new chapter for Katness and Peeta, well they thought. I will not tell the rest, nope i will not. I did like it alot i read it in a week it is a very easy read alf becuase it is a childrens book in away and half becuase it is a story that you NEED to know what will happen.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|This book was...wow...I never thought I would like a book that centers on a witch. I don't like witch books but since this had other supernaturals in it I decided to stick to it and finish reading it. I am so glad that I finished this book!!! It was great I loved every moment of it and I hated it when the book ended, I just hope the second book comes out sometime soon.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters they was a mix of different personalities. Sophia is a newbie Wicca she doesn't have many friends because of what happen long time ago and how everyone thinks she is studying the dark magic. Which is wrong because she only practices the good magic. She has a strong personality and is really stubborn when it comes to her relationship with Charles. She isn't close to her family but she does have two friends Ivory and Lauren. There is not much interaction with Lauren but Ivory is in it a bit more then Lauren before she disappeared and reappeared halfway through the book before disappearing again. Charles is a sexy guy, though he can not make up his mind about anything. He wants Sophie but then he doesn't want her. You learn many things about him that keep you attracted/interested to him hehe!<br /><br />The Romance in this book goes around in circles a lot. If you thought Twilight was bad with Edward hating himself and not wanting to be with Bella because he's a vampire then this is just as bad. Charles wants to be with Sophie but he shouldn't because of what he is. Then he goes and kisses her before breaking apart and change the subject. He then asks her to move in so he could watch over her but says she's to stay in the guest room but wants to be near her. . .like I said it goes around in circles for a long while. Sophie is no better she's confuse by how he acts towards her even when they feel the same way towards each other. Besides all the running around in circles they do end up together and they act so cute together. He's sweet and takes care of her, this book isdiffidently not for teens because of how the describe the sex scene but otherwise it was a great romance from the middle onward.<br /><br />The plot was so fun!! I really loved the plot it centers around Sophie and how she learns about another world she never knew before. She gets more pulled into it when she learns about her heritage and about the people around her. There is a few twists in this book that would make you freak go \\"What!!\\" not to mention that the ending will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />I do reccomand this book if you like the supernatural world and Witches. It's a great plot and once you get past the circles in the romance that's quite good as well. I'm sure everyone would enjoy this book.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Although I have enjoyed most of the DC comic dvds this one has me watching it over and over again. The voice actiing is great, the action cool (especially the Red Hood), there are twists and turns in the plot and the story deep - too deep for children. I have never been a rabid Batman fan and this film hit the core of my distaste - why does Batman not kill the serial killers that he has faced time and time again? Maybe it has been answered in the comics but in this film it is answered in a truly poignant, adult manner. The only problem is that I agree with the Red Hood! Regardless, if you like the gritty side of the Batman story is this by far and away the best story ever made.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|If your a fan of Bob Dylan then this is a MUST HAVE CD. Dylan's songs and lyrics have been covered by many often but this collection stands out by its diversity of musicians and THEIR various interpretations. It's mixed with big names and obscure names and their interpretations are both familiar and at other times a far departure of the more recognizable original. I'm enjoying it and have already recommended it to others and will continue to do so.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I saw this in the Theaters and yes visually it rocked, But story wise I felt it was missing something. I waited for prices to drop before purchaseing this. Got it for under 12 bucks at COSTCO. That was still too much money. Yes it still visually rocked. But the extra 17 mins or so didn't really add any depth and the animated shorts were a total let down. Not Zac Snyders best work. It needed more depth.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|About 300 years after the publication of the first collected works of Shakespeare, the so-called First Folio (1623), a schoolmaster named J. Thomas Looney (pronounced \\"loanee\\") facilitated his students in readings of the Shakespeare plays, particularly \\"the Merchant of Venice\\". Over the years while watching the plays, hearing their rhetoric, and absorbing this remarkable voice whose Elizabethan presence is still revered and studied today, Looney became convinced the man from Stratford who is attributed to having written the plays (the Orthodox View), was not the true author. He came to believe the name \\"William Shakespeare\\" which appeared on two published poems, the later quartos and the First Folio was in reality a pseudonym for someone else, possibly a nobleman. Previously, those who questioned the Orthodox View, sometimes called Anti-Stratfordians, had proposed others of the Elizebethan Age, such as Sir Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe, but Looney was convinced the true author was someone never before put forth since Shakespearian scholarship began in the 18th century. Shakespeare has and still does remain shrouded in mystery.<br /><br />Because Shakespeare biographical detail has been sketchy at best, Looney developed a profile similar to those used by detectives to paint a picture of his candidate, based on elements in the plays. He determined the writer was a nobleman, a Falconer, possibly sympathetic to the Lancastrian side of the Wars of the Roses, and someone who loved Italy and Italian culture. And, most important of all, that he was a poet who possibly had written poems and/or plays under his own name before going under the name of William Shakespeare. After finding a number of primary sources at the British Library, he came up with his findings. Looney proposed a somewhat forgotten nobleman named Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, as being the true identity of the poet/playwright William Shakespeare in a book called simply \\"Shakespeare Identified\\".<br /><br />\\"Anonymous\\" is a film based on Looney's original notion that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, penned the plays which would become the greatest literary canon of the English language. The events surrounding the plays, their performances, Oxford's conscious willingness to stay behind the scenes, and the attribution of the plays to the man from Stratford, a businessman who had little or no experience in theatre, are all dramatized in a period film which takes you back to the world of the Elizabethan Stage. One of the best aspects of \\"Anonymous\\" is how it relates the plays to political rhetoric of the period. In recent years, Shakespearian scholars have proposed that many figures of the Elizabethan Court were satirized in the plays, such as William Cecil and his son Robert Cecil. The links between the plays and contemporary politics are brought to the fore much more directly than in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".<br /><br />Character actor Rhys Ifans offers an Oscar-caliber performance as the man who some believe was the real Shakespeare. Ifans finds that delicate balance between the remarkable artist and the troubled nobleman who could not reconcile the two worlds of his life. If Shakespeare was in fact a nobleman who went under a pseudonym, many of the events portrayed in \\"Anonymous\\" are plausible. Unlike today, playwrights and poets lived on the periphery of society, and a nobleman of the rank of Oxford writing plays containing charged political rhetoric would have been scandalous, hence the Shakespeare-Oxford theory.<br /><br />The hero of the movie is actually his colleague Ben Johnson, the Elizabethan playwright who has always dwelt under the shadow of Shakespeare, especially in modern times. Johnson would have been the greatest playwright of his age if Shakespeare had not been writing. In this story, he becomes the guardian of the Shakespeare plays, and supposedly the man who saves the canon for posterity. Johnson in fact wrote the preface to theFirst Folio of 1623. If there had been a cover-up of Shakespeare's true identity, Johnson would have known.<br /><br />While the film bases many of its embellishments on facts known about Edward de Vere, the film does take a few rather implausible historical licenses, not unlike Amadeus which appeared about 25 years ago. Edward de Vere may have flirted with Queen Elizabeth when he was younger, but whether they bore a child does seem quite fantastic. Later in the film, an extraordinary truth about Oxford's own heritage is revealed. However, films have to tell a story, and some licenses are made in order the story remain interesting and compelling. Shakespeare in many of his plays bent history to fulfill his dramatic goals and theatrical visions.<br /><br />Many Shakespeare enthusiasts not only dismiss the Oxfordian argument but do not approve of the subject altogether. Some Stratfordians' view is that there is no \\"authorship question\\" and that any attempt to discredit the man from Stratford does a disservice to Shakespare. I think \\"Anonymous\\" is not so much about changing minds but about bringing the question out into the open. Regardless on which side of the fence you may be, there are a lot of questions concerning the life of Shakespeare. Answers to mundane questions, such as primary sources concerning his composing, are strangely absent. No one seems to have mentioned Stratford being any kind of a poet, playwright or actor in Stratford. However, as shown in the film, primary source evidence survives which speaks of Edward de Vere as an adolescent putting on a short play for the young Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />So the film brings us back to the fundamental question: did Oxford write the Shakespeare Canon or was it the man from Stratford? Primary source evidence is sparse, and documents which could have shed light on this problem may have perished in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In short, we may never know. But Oxford's star is on the rise, and in years to come, this may be the first film to acknowledge there is indeed a question. Whether it has been answered is up to each viewer.First Folio of 1623.

B00005MNP7|5.0|Just to be clear: as an adult, I am a classical musician. I don't listen much anymore to the rock/pop music of the late 1970's and 1980's which enthralled in my younger days except for a small handful of exceptional music. I was an avid listener of Journey, Styx, Scorpions, and Triumph, but I have moved on from most of them in favor of other voices. However, Blondie is one of those exceptions. Ironically, they were never quite my favorite band but they were one of the earliest I remember liking, and one I have continually returned to even when I let the others go. And \\"Eat to the Beat\\" is no question one of their best offerings. As an adult, I do find myself still enjoying being enveloped in their sound. Blondie has something. What that is, I am not sure. They have a trademark sound which is very identifiable. Here it is, over 3 decades, and \\"Eat to the Beat\\" still seems very fresh and original. The opening track \\"Dreaming\\" is the perfect opening song for the album. Blondie, with the voice of Deborah Harry and the subtle guitar accompaniment and percussion has a kind of dreamy quality which is not true of many other bands past and present. \\"Dreaming\\" brings us into the dreamy world which is the Blondie \\"voice\\", \\"voice\\" in the sense of their overall sound. \\"Union City Blues\\", \\"Shayla\\" and \\"Atomic\\" also have this otherworldy quality. One of my favorite tracks if not one of my favorite songs produced in the late 1970's and early 1980's, is a very underrated song: \\"Slow Motion\\". \\"Slow Motion\\", which was not a hit in its own right as far as I know, is an underrated little pop-rock masterpiece. \\"Slow Motion\\" describes the subtle body language and even politics of the dance floor. A young man has lost his \\"baby\\" to another on the floor, and is sulking in the back. Another girl who was doing \\"the quake\\" so hard, it made her sick. Yet another girl is using gestures to say \\"catch me if you can\\". And when two dancers find that strange, wonderful yet enigmatic bond which is more infrequent than it should be, suddently, we are told, \\"The world slows down and she stops on a dime\\". These people enter the world of \\"slow motion\\". Time is in another dimension and has almost no meaning. \\"Slow motion, I can play with time, I can keep today but tomorrow's fine\\". This song is just one of those rare pop offerings that just gives me the shivers everytime I play it, and in some ways again captures the dream-world of Blondie. The whole dance floor becomes this dream-like reality apart from the time constrained real world. The whole album is a minor masterpiece of the rock-pop genre. Blondie has never fit neatly into either category. Were they a rock group with some pop sensibilities or a pop group with some rock influence? Although they have the female lead, the similarities with groups like Heart and Pat Benatar end there. As I detest most pure pop music, Blondie was and is the one band which is the closest sound to a rock-pop hybrid.e infrequent than it should be, suddently, we are told, \\"The world slows down and she stops on a dime\\".

B0059XTTW8|5.0|The idealized world of spy adventure which is the trademark of the James Bond books and films really has nothing to do with foreign intelligence. Unlike Ian Fleming (who wrote the James Bond novels), John Le Carre's vision of the world of spies came directly from first-hand experience. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Le Carre worked for British Intelligence and the British Foreign Service, taking part in wire taps, break-ins, and defector interrogations. This is a world of shadowed corners, darkened rooms, uncomfortable headsets, and endless transcriptions, not ski resorts and casino hotels.<br /><br />Gary Oldman offers the performance of his career as the older intelligence genius, George Smiley, assigned to find the \\"mole\\" inside a branch of British Intelligence code-named \\"the Circus\\". A mole is a double-agent, someone pretending to be on one side but in fact working for the other who has burrowed himself inside the upper-reaches of the organization, allowing for easy access to classified information which can be leaked to the other side. When a younger agent, Jim Prideaux, is sent on a mission to Budapest to meet with a general supposedly defecting to the west, it becomes obvious the other side knew almost immediately about the meeting. The meeting point is at a caf&eacute; which turns deadly when even before the meeting has begun, he is shot at. In other words, someone in British Intelligence had informed the other side of the meeting. Also, a another young low-level agent goes to the east and befriends a young woman looking to defect who claims she has knowledge about an intelligence mole.<br /><br />Smiley goes on a kind of murder-mystery-like investigation to determine why the Budapest meeting became a fiasco and simultaneously uncover the identity of the mole. Each of the witnesses give their understanding of the story, how they are involved, and how each story fits into a larger mosaic of intrigue and betrayal. Part of the trick to navigating this film is understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment. The top suspects are all high-ranking British Intelligence agents, and given code names: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poor Man. When he identifies the perpetrator, instead of indicating them by name, Smiley will simply offer the code name.<br /><br />An outstanding, if darkly atmospheric film which is a much more realistic portrayal of the shrouded world of foreign espionage. Some younger viewers may be frustrated because of the lack of action and the less than straight-forward linear progression. Each piece of the puzzle takes time to come to the fore. This film is more of a subtler suspense thriller rather than an action movie. Early on, many incidences are revealed without explanation at first. But if you can be patient, the film really starts to kick in at about the 30 to 45 min mark.<br /><br />What we really learn is that the world of spies is ultimately about secrets. Who has them, who doesn't, and who doesn't want which secret to be revealed to whom. And all of the participants are haggard, spent people, not the glamorous icons portrayed in Hollywood spy thrillers. The skis, cocktails, waitresses, and roulette tables are strangely absent. Dim halls, unkempt studies, and damp cells are where these people reside.understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|SPOILERS:<br />This movie defies genre's.  At its core it's a human drama about the relationships between these crew members when things go very wrong and they have to face very difficult questions regarding the balance between their mission and their humanity.  I've watched this two or three times and the thing that hooked me from the beginning was the lack of ANY of your typical sci-fi staples.  No aliens, no lasers (not even any guns), no self aware androids, etc.  The absence of these things made this a very believable story.  The force pushing this story forward wasn't even about conflict that much (though there certainly was some), it was very real questions on how to deal with a crappy situation.  If you told me I'd be glued to my seat for a movie that was largely based on weighing risk assessments for mission goals I'd say you were crazy, but the acting/pacing/music/etc. and general production of this movie made it enjoyable and very realistic.<br />A note on the realism, some have criticized the lack of scientific accuracy of this movie.  My response to that is why, all of the sudden, do we hold outer space sci-fi movies to that standard?  I guess my answer to my own question would be because this movie is so engaging and believable (none of the science in this movie was that far fetched.  I mean in 2012 I completely believe that most of the technology on that ship will exist within the next decade) people forget that it's a movie and they are going to take liberties with certain things to make it dramatic.<br />I would easily give this movie 5 stars and say it was one of my favorites if it weren't for the ending.  And seeing as how the ending is a pretty crucial part of a movie that makes it a big fault in my eyes.  The movie ends with a complete shift into some kind of horror genre that is so different from the rest of the movie it's a bit jarring, I found myself asking what the hell was going on quite a bit the first time I saw it.  I was completely intothe story, had empathy for the characters and felt that it was a surprisingly realistic movie  and then this supernatural element appears and although it was explained it seemed like it was just thrown on at the end because some producer said \\"It's not a space movie without ........\\"  It was too bad.<br />It's not so bad that it completely ruins the movie for me though, I mean I have watched this two or three times.

1400063515|5.0|A mostly entertaining and sometimes irritating book full of wisdom and vanity, about the toxicity of facts, the impossibility of meaningful predictions, and life in the opposing worlds of Mediocristan and Extremistan.<br /><br />Our brains are unable to accept unpredictability. We make up explanations for past events, in the false hope that we can then understand the future, though important things happen mostly outside the narrow corridor of normality. Like the turkey, who has been fed for so many days and projects a positive trend on a linear straight line. Thanksgiving is the turkey's Black Swan.<br /><br />Taleb is a proper Popperian, which is certainly a good thing in my book. He is also to be praised for his aversion to Platonification. He admires Mandelbrot, which means less to me, but that is surely my fault. And he says he owes more to Kahneman than to anybody else in the world. I believe that and consider it a recommendation.<br />I do dislike his snotty comments on the Enlightenment and on operas, though. On the other hand, he has the originality to praise both Keynes and Hayek as true thinkers, while the likes of Samuelson turned economics into fraud with their pseudo mathematics and rational man models. I am particularly pleased with Taleb for this rant, since that was exactly my opinion when I was a student of economics. Looong ago.<br /><br />The author recommends not to read newspapers and not to watch TV for information and interpretation. (I hope he doesn't oppose football news and the Sopranos.) Those details and facts cloud our understanding, and everyone else knows them anyway. He suggests to go to parties and pick up chance information from small talk.<br /><br />For all his insights, the author is able and likely to make silly judgmental statements.<br />What about this one: he mocks people who use an elevator to go to the gym, where they use the stair master. Mr. Taleb, have you no practical sense? Don't you sweat if or when you work out?<br />Another one: he claims that loss of manufacturing jobs can go along with a general rise of living standards. Possibly so, but we are not told where that is happening. Certainly not in the US.<br />This book will not bore you, but it may annoy you a few times. I revisit it for the second edition and like it much better this time than last time. The new edition adds a lengthy essay and more footnotes, but keeps the original main text body intact./>Another one: he claims that loss of manufacturing jobs can go along with a general rise of living standards.

Sometimes there was just no picture even though our room shares a wall with our baby's room.  I researched baby monitors for quite some time and was excited when I found the Withings smart baby monitor.  The only issue was that it was not available in the US yet.  After several months of waiting it finally became available so I snatched it up and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />Video quality is much better than our previous camera and I LOVE that I can access it away from home.  It is so wonderful to see my baby sleeping while I have to work late.  I haven't had a problem with the limited time period away from home but it would be nice to have the option for extended viewing for free.  The night vision is about on par with our previous monitor and gets the job done.  I am able to tell what he is doing in bed without issues.<br /><br />The screen shows temperature and humidity which is nice feature that I would have really enjoyed having when he was a newborn.<br /><br />I love being able to use my phone to talk to him, my husband and I have both utilized this feature away from the house and it works very well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have another way to mount it (perhaps on the wall) besides on the crib because the other day my son had managed to pull it off and into the crib.<br /><br />I really enjoy having this baby monitor and have already recommended it to several of my friends.  If you have an iPhone and the $$$, I would say go for it, you will not be disappointed.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book it has just the right amount of romance, action, and emotion in it to make you never want to put it down. I just finished reading the book (just in case you didn't catch this i LOVED IT) and cannot wait for the movie to come out. When i read i picture surrondings i know personally to the ones in the book and i come up with a pretty good picture of the setting. this book described it perfectly though and i barely had to do this at all my favorite characters (besides Katniss and Peeta of course) have to be foxface and rue. i don't think it ever said foxfaces real name though.....forgotten mystery!!=) anyway i love this book and i would reccomend it to anyone!
1416575464|3.0|This book is fun to browse but may seem dated in a few years, like most decorating books.  If you were a fan of the defunct magazine, you'll see the same featured interiors with a little more infofmation about styles, etc.  Solid book to flip through if you're in the midst of redecorating, so you'll get plenty of tips and ideas.

B000NMW6J8|3.0|Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges address homegrown terrorism and the fiber of manipulation as a pair of wary, suspicious suburban neighbors. Robbins is terrific as the shady new guy who keeps his emotions close to the vest, pairing a wicked, piercing gaze with an ambiguous, noncommittal temperament. Bridges, the viewer's perspective and proposed voice of reason, is much less fascinating; a vanilla conspiracy theorist with a short fuse, it's tough to find sympathy for his obsessive investigations of the new acquaintance, even when they start bearing some fruit. The film's musings on terrorism in a pre-9/11 America are interesting food for thought, particularly in that they seem to be challenging many of the knee-jerk reactions that eventually would take place. Ultimately, a bold, memorable finale somewhat redeems the plot, which is quite predictable up to that point.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game because if the settings you can choose for a deck with a challenge or if you want to make your kids feel better there is a winning setting where the deck is super easy and you always win.
1612130283|2.0|I'm in a book club and they chose this one for the March-read.  Are there any book discussion questions? I looked in the back, where they usually are in the non-pornos we usually read, but nothing was there except the stupid cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />I can't imagine what we'll talk about for 2 hours!<br /><br />It's about a rich pervert hooking up with a virgin in Portland/Seattle.  They enjoy a lot of soft porn sex.  The writing is horrible.<br />But it's an easy/fast read and there's sex betweeen two hot people, one who is psycho from child abuse and as a result likes dominant/submissive sex and the other who is psycho from a personality disorder involving an extremely annoying \\"inner goddess.\\"<br />So I give it 2 stars for the sexstuff, otherwise I would have trashed this trash after a couple of chapters.<br /><br />What is there to discuss?  The moral ramifications of Dom/Sub sexplay in our increasingly religious 21st century society?<br />It'll be an interesting meeting.........

B0016492BW|5.0|I've been a Monty Python fan my entire life, and a huge fan of this film in particular. This is the best that MP&THG has ever looked, and perhaps as good as it ever will, or even can, look or sound.<br /><br />Instead of rehashing what has already been said about the film itself and the shiny new 1080p video, I'd like to focus on a few of the extras, and what exactly is different about this release compared to the previous DVD release.<br /><br />Most of the extras (Holy Grail locations, etc.) were all on the earlier DVD, but the new additions, the Outtakes and Lost Animations, are real gems available for the first time only on this Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The Outtakes consist of longer versions of some scenes, which were understandably cut or shortened, but there are also some alternate takes and screw-ups with the cast forgetting lines or laughing in the middle of a take. It's all great fun, and a humorous look behind the scenes at an already drop-dead hilarious movie.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam's Lost Animations are a hoot. We see a few spare parts that may not have had any particular intent, but there is also an extended opening to The Tale of Sir Robin, involving a collapsing cathedral, a stray rock catapulted into the sky and knocking out a flying dragon-like creature which then falls into the title card, impaling its mouth, collapsing, thus creating the \\"R\\" in \\"Robin.\\"  And there is also an extended opening to \\"The Tale of Sir Lancelot\\" in which a cartoon Lancelot battles a giant slug. Total Gilliam lunacy at his stream-of-consciousness best!<br /><br />The only cut scene I wish had been included as an extra is \\"King Brian the Wild,\\" which is a scene that was written but never shot. It appears only as a pencil sketch animation with sound on the Holy Grail video game that came out during the Dark Ages of video games. Unless it's an easter egg on this disc, or if it appears in the \\"Holy Book of Days,\\" which I have not had a chance to explore yet.<br /><br />There area couple of things missing from the Blu-Ray, including the \\"Follow the Rabbit\\" feature from the previous DVD. That feature would be useless here anyway, since the new \\"Holy Book of Days\\" downloadable feature promises to be far more extensive and comprehensive.  Also, the false opening \\"Dentist on the Job\\" short is not at the start of the film. Not a deal-breaker, of course, but if you are fond of that ephemeral opening gag, then hang on to your DVD.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray menus are much better than the DVD menus, which I always thought were rather tedious and impossible to by-pass.<br /><br />The various audio tracks, commentaries and subtitles (including the Japanese language track and the Henry VI subtitles) are all there, but on the DVD the default audio was the original mono track. Here the default is the more recent stereo remaster, including Michael Palin's re-recording of the narration.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release is a very impressive return to a fantastic comedy that has stood the test of time.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I'm a huge Bruce fan and I accept that every 10 years or so he needs to channel Woodie Guthrie and ease the guilt of having made a bloody fortune.  The good news Is that this time around it's not an acoustic record and we'll get  an  E Street Band Tour and there's interesting arrangements that make for 5 solid songs.<br /><br />The  bad news is that the writing is simplistic, repetitive and all the  \\"characters\\" are the same, they all got screwed  by \\"the man\\". Critics will love this( as will the Grammy voters),  but this Is middle of the  pack Bruce material and not the signature record being hyped. When his writing is good, he doesn't beat you over the head with the message as he feels he needs to do on this record.<br /><br />Unlike Magic and The Rising in recent years  this one won't be in my CD player after a few months.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Great love story. You can just feel the devotion and passion these two guys feel for each other and it is done in such a pure, innocent way that you forget you're dealing with incest.
B004ZNACA6|3.0|The quality of the these re-mastered recordings is excellent.  I owned many of these on the original CD pressings and these compare favorably.  I am extremely disappointed in the packaging.  The CD's and booklets are difficult to remove from their cardboard sleeves.  I've found 2 where the booklets were glued in.  The Wall Set sleeve is falling apart in my set.  I also don't appreciate having the CD's in The Wall and Ummagumma placed together play-side to play-side. I feel the 14 were crammed into the box.  I don't understand why these sets can't be packaged using Jewel Cases or at least digipaks.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|My Nikon D40 and an older Nikon Coolpix 5600 can plug directly into my iPad2, OS5.1 using one of the two adapters and transfer pictures ok.  My newer Nikon Coolpix S6200 will not transfer plugged in direct.  With it, I get an error message saying it draws too much power.  For it then, I have to remove the SD card and use the other adapter that comes with the kit.  That works ok then.  The kit, by having the two adapters, gets the job done.  However, a list of what draws too much power would be nice to see. As others have mentioned, after transfering you pics, don't get trigger happy and delete them off you camera, unless you wish to do so.

B004XS97QS|5.0|I remember as a kid, I was about 12 I think, I was at a friends house that liked Dr Who and I watched it once with him and thought it was the dumbest show ever made and never watched it again. About 7 years ago I was on vacation and got stuck in the room one day because it was raining too bad to go do anything and I am so glad it rained that day.<br /><br />I was stuck watching whatever i could find on tv and it just so happened one of the channels was showing the complete first season of the new Dr Who so I watched and by the end of the season I was hooked! I wish as a kid I had given it a few more tries but what is done is done.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of Matt as dr who but I have to admit this last season was great, it ties up so much of the past shows and makes a lot of stuff clear. You have to watch this.

It would have been an extremely hard subject to write about ,but it was written with such dignity .I applaud it<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend \\"You before Me \\"
1576875776|5.0|After checking out DP Review a couple weeks ago, I saw a story about a book on a photographer called Vivian Maier.  Immediately I was blown away!  So I decided to order the book.  I almost (thank God I didn't) order one on eBay for $100.  So I placed my order and waited patiently.  And It arrived!  Such pictures!<br /><br />What really disheartens me is to read reviews of people saying the book is \\"bad\\" because of blank pages and poor sepia tones.  To even HAVE this collection of photos is a rare gift and a little gratitude might be in order to Mr. Maloof and everyone else involved in such an extraordinary project!  These images invite us into a world of someone else's imagination and their vision.  The street photography that Ms. Maier (thank you very much) captures will influence future photgraphers, students, artists, historians etc.  So please do not denigrate the hard work of the people who made this possible!<br /><br />I personally love the book and will buy future copies of any further works being released.  I recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate the quirky, vivid and often profound work of Vivian Maier!

0375842209|5.0|For me reading The Book Thief was a happy accident. I had just finished reading a book and was sitting around trying to figure out what I was going to read next. I noticed The Book Thief sitting on top of Deb's to-read pile. I picked it up knowing nothing about the book (except the title). After reading the first page I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I was surprised and intrigued that the story was being told by Death. The story starts in 1939 Germany and revolves around a little girl named Liesel (the book theft), her foster parents, a neighbor boy, and a Jew.<br /><br />I ended up loving all the characters (even those that were less likable). Markus Zusak did a wonderful job of humanizing all the characters and showing the horrors of war from all perspectives. The best thing about this story is the way it shows that people are people and that there are good people everywhere (including Nazi Germany).<br /><br />There are many books that I love and would recommend to \\"everyone\\". The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is one of the few books that I think should be read by everyone. For me it's right there with To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee.
B006OV7S1I|3.0|Spent the evening watching this film, I finished it and it left me with mixed feelings. There is no denying that it was some what fresh with a new idea, quite original I'd say.<br /><br />the story is that of a young girl Martha \\" played by Elizabeth Olsen \\", who tries adapting to her life with her family after fleeing a group of a weird cult whom she lived with for about two years.<br />its quite an original concept, at least for me, as the director takes us back into Martha's past while living with the cult in flashback, I usually am not a big fan of films that relies heavily on flashbacks, i feel it disrupts the stream of the film, however, the director executed it skillfully.<br /><br />the film was more of a character study, something I like very much in movies since my work involves analyzing people and the way they think. the character of Martha was very intriguing to me as she goes through her inner struggle trying to adapt to a normal life after the strange and bizarre practices she witnessed and participated in with that cult group. she was clearly damaged.<br /><br />Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Ashley and Mary - kate Olsen, the rich twins known from the 80s - 90s family T.v series Full House, was surprisingly good here, I've never seen her before in any work, and so I never thought she's that good, especially with a complex character like Martha. Bravo..I predict a bright future for her in movies.<br /><br />Now why the mixed feelings ? well, it was a bit depressing and while i enjoyed the character of Martha and was impressed by the concept of the film, it moved in a very slow pace. the director spends a lot of time in certain scenes that could have easily been edited for a faster pace, but i can understand why, as he wants the audience feel the reality of the scenes, and i think he succeeds in doing so. however, certain scenes were too long.<br /><br />In the end, I was surprised with this film, in a good a way, it was different, focusing onthe character and the inner struggle, but it didn't leave me with a good feeling for a number of reasons. I also don't think this film is for everyone, people might feel bored with the slow pace, especially those who are looking for a Thriller or a Horror.<br />I'd say 8 out of 10<br /><br />moebardi.blogspot.com

B001E45XT4|2.0|While these are only about $25 at the time I bought them, they are quite uncomfortable for all the marketing-speak in the item description for what they really are. I work in a call-center with a headset on most of the day, so when I go home to game, I need a headset that's lightweight and ergonomically designed to put as little pressure on my head as possible. This is not the headset to get if comfort is your concern.<br /><br />Tested these over about a month, they are just plain heavy. I feel like my neck has been lifting weights after wearing these for a few hours. The cups also put a fair amount of side-pressure on my head. A good headset will both even out the pressure on the head, and put very little total pressure as a whole. These are just plain heavy pressure, even if it's \\"even\\" pressure as the description claims.<br /><br />If you want a good headset that's lightweight, ergonomic, and has bass reproduction that will knock your socks off, get the \\"SteelSeries Siberia V2 Full-Size USB Gaming Headset\\" instead. They're around $100, which is a lot more, but they'll also last much longer, are supremely comfortable, and have much better design in general. They also come with a USB soundcard that offloads some of the processing work from your computer (it has its own internal processor for audio) which can translate into improved gaming performance.<br /><br />One good thing I do have to say about these, the mic quality is decent. I've made several recordings with this headset plugged into an Olympus recorder on the highest quality setting, and the quality is comparable to a stand-alone $60 stereo cardioid mic I bought. Not bad for a headset in that respect.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|As this film got rolling, I thought, \\"Oh no! Lead actor Michael Shannon really is being typecast!\\" I felt he'd played this role of a schizophrenic with an increasingly dangerous obsession before - and before. \\"Take Shelter\\" looks like an alternate version of the movie \\"Bug\\" [[ASIN:B000T5O48K Bug (Special Edition)]] in which he starred - only instead of bodily infestation, here he becomes consumed with worry over the likelihood of a coming Armageddon of storms. This movie also looks like an alternate version of \\"My Son, My Son, What Have Ye' Done?\\" [[ASIN:B003XJ9N6M My Son, My Son - What Have Ye' Done?]] in which he plays a troubled man who's increasingly losing touch with reality as a racking drama of voices and obsessions plays out in his head.<br /><br />Shannon does disturbance extraordinarily well. But I began to fade from this film, as I became convinced I'd seen it all before. The principal thing that held my interest was the photography. The shots of ominous gatherings of clouds and birds and Shannon's darkening horizon are arresting.<br /><br />But wait. This movie does take a turn into some wholly different implications. Its novelty comes so late in the movie though, many habitual movie-goers might not hang in there to see it. They might leave with the impression this in another Shannon progression into madness.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Bug\\" or \\"My Son, My Son,\\" you can appreciate this film as a singular tour de force performance by Shannon. If you have seen those other movies about obsession, I suggest you wait and see this movie through. It has many worthwhile features, and will give you something different to think about in the end.

B000JIN3HK|5.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.<br /><br />Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.<br /><br />What lets down this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

0312641893|5.0|Let's see, I will admit that it took me quite awhile to finally finish Cinder. Why, you ask? Because the story lagged at first, but after about seven chapters it finally picked up. Then, I could not put it down for the life of me. It was amazing!<br /><br />I felt sad, happy, and frustrated. It was an emotional ride and a unique retelling of Cinderella that ended in an astounding cliffhanger. I'm begging for more! I can't wait until 2013, when the second book will be released. The parts that were especially frustrating were the ones where Kai and Cinder where together. It was sweet, but I was constantly thinking, \\"Get on with your relationship already!\\". Well, the ending was bittersweet, because Kai and Cinder were left a bad point.<br /><br />I adored Kai. He was a kind prince/emperor, but I did not feel a deep enough connection with him. I'm hoping I'll get to know him even better in the next few books. On the other hand, Queen Levana I do not want to get to know at all. Cruel, murderer, and all of the insults that can be thought of describe her. She is just terrible, one of the worst, the perfect villain.<br /><br />Lastly, I've always been fascinated with the moon, and how it would be amazing if people could live here, so when I saw Cinder I had to read it. Kingdom on the moon! Awesome! And Marissa Meyer is a fan of Sailor Moon, which is where I assume she got some of her inspiration from. A completely amazing read, that you will never regret reading!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|In a world that has survived a gruesome post-apocalyptic event, the survival of the young adults is just as dangerously horrendous! Among the recently formed civilization, children 12-18 years-of-age must be submissive to an annual ritual that selects the chosen ones into the Hunger Games with hopes of surviving the treacherous killing game that is awaiting their destiny. What makes it more interesting is that the day's events are televised for all communities to observe.  With a dreadfully thrilling journey, beastly theme, and a callous audience coupled with extraordinary characters, and you have one thrilling, wonderfully horrific adventure. Truly an amazing read!  Kudos to the author, Suzanne Collins, for such an engaging, well-written story. Highly Recommend!

B000OP1M6M|5.0|I've been wearing the SKX009K2 for a while now, and this watch has served me well. Other reviewers may have already mentioned the tendency for these automatics to run fast; this seems par for the course for this type of watch in general and something that the buyer should know about ahead of time before investing in an automatic. I've found quartz movements to be the most reliable (especially in this price range), and so those looking for better accuracy should buy quartz. That being said, this automatic is a great value for the price, durable, cheap and stylish enough to wear anywhere from the beach to a formal dinner setting.<br /><br />I got this watch nearly 6 months ago, and was drawn in by its history and nearly cult-like following on watch forums. I have been impressed by the build quality since day one, and it has a good heft on the wrist, but not so much that you feel weighted down. I had a couple links removed from the band to go for a more snug fit, but I think others may opt for a nato strap or rubber depending on if you plan to go diving with it. I've found that the stainless steel strap that comes with this watch is durable enough for most occasions, and works quite well with most outfits.<br /><br />The 1-directional bezel is actually quite useful for timing short intervals. The red styling provides a great color contrast and allows you to gauge elapsed time, even in low light conditions. The lume in this watch is BRIGHT. I have a Luminox Blackout 3051, and this Seiko is just as bright as the gas-filled tubes used in the Luminox.<br /><br />This is a great watch for the money, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive, stylish automatic that is also durable to boot.
1451683405|1.0|Sam Harris Free Will<br /><br />Sam Harris is a master of the polemic.  He has written very eloquently and convincingly concerning atheism in his books, The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation.  Full disclosure:  My wife, Mary C. Taylor, and I are atheists and she has a website and video lectures on atheism, as well as being assistant organizer and lecturer of an atheist Meetup. She has contributed signifantly to this essay.  Mr. Harris is an important force for secularism in the United States.<br />But his latest offering, Free Will, a scant 66 page essay in book format (with some 7 pages of notes,) is lacking in many essential ways, particularly in the matter of evidence for his claims. Harris states there is no free will, that it is an illusion, but offers no proof for his assertion.  In fact, on Pages 13, 38, 39, and 40, he states that the sources of our intentions, desires, actions, and wants are unknown, a mystery, inscrutable or obscure.  He seems to be asserting that because we do not know the sources for our thoughts and actions, it necessarily follows that we do not have free will.  Such a flimsy connection is not proof.  He cites some well known experiments, such as the Libet, all of which are inconclusive, and does not provide the reader with strong scientific evidence to back up his assertions.<br />Mr. Harris critiques compatibilism by too often, for such a short essay, emphasizing the differences between himself and Daniel Dennett, the philosopher who has written Elbow Room and Freedom Evolves.  In fact, Dennett makes a very cogent case for the compatibilism and coexistence of determinism and free will in human beings.  One of Mr. Harris's breezy dismissals of compatibilism on Page 16 is that the \\"free will compatibilists defend is not the free will most people feel they have.\\"  Such a statement seems to imply that Mr. Harris sets aside the fine and scholarly work of many philosophers such as Dennett, because it does not accord with some popular misconception of free will.  Populism would appear to trump scholarship in this book.<br />On Pages 10 and 24, Harris apparently infers that if we had exceptional machines and brain scanners to monitor our action sequences and choices, we would be astounded to discover that we were not in control of them.  However, we do not yet have experiments that might be conclusive. To state that one knows the outcome of future experiments is nonsense. In fact, neuroscience is at the beginning of a long voyage of discovery about the brain, the mind and consciousness.<br />Another difficulty with \\"Free Will\\" is the author's shift to prescription rather than description. Such a segue is yet another example of the philosopher David Hume's famous and much discussed Is/Ought problem concerning Ethics.  Harris suddenly advocates what the justice system should do. On Page 54, he writes: \\"Our system of justice should reflect an understanding that any of us could have been dealt a different hand in life.  In fact, it seems immoral not to recognize just how much luck is involved with morality itself.\\"  Why should any of us assume, given Mr. Harris's assertion that choices are not in our control, that most citizens will agree about changes to our justice system?  Many people, if not in conscious control of their belief and ethical systems, may reach opposite conclusions.  Mr. Harris is not the only champion of determinism who seems to dismiss reason as a motivating factor, and then to advocate change based on conscious reasoning.<br />My opinion, after reading this small book, is that Sam Harris has done very little to advance understanding or forward the argument in the contentious and knotty issue of free will and determinism. With all due respect, I regretfully cannot recommend his Free Will to readers. Daniel Dennett's Elbow Room and Freedom Evolves are excellent starting places for a discussion of the argument.  The problem of free will vis-à-vis determinism reaches back to Ancient Greece and Israel, and is not quickly or easily perused.  Galen Strawson, Saul Smilansky, Peter Strawson, Manuel Vargas, Robert Kane and Daniel Wegner are excellent sources.  Robert Kane has edited the Oxford Handbook of Free Will, with superb essays on both sides of the divide.  Professor Shaun Nichols, from the University of Arizona, offers an excellent DVD course from the Teaching Company on Free Will and Determinism that is very balanced, thorough and essential for the appraisal and understanding of the multitudinous opinions and experiments concerning free will and determinism.

0553584537|3.0|This book was very hard to put down. In fact, I stayed up all night because I couldn't bear not knowing what happened next. Needless to say, I am one very tired lady right now. It was worth the lack of sleep however. This book lets us know from the outset who the bad guys are, so rather than trying to guess the culprit, the suspense is built around whether the heroine will be believed, or whether the bad guys will win.<br /><br />Having said that, for the most part the characters in this story are neither wholly bad or wholly good. Rather they are flawed human beings, trying hard to make the best of a bad situation. This serves the purpose of humanising them and leaves us wondering - what would we do if we were put in that situation? If you like mystery and suspense in your novels, you will like this book.

0062112430|5.0|Oh wow, this was MOST EXCELLENT! The main character is Lena who is counting down the days until she receives \\"the procedure\\". At the age of 18, or earlier in some cases for those showing signs of deliria, everyone goes through a procedure which cures them of the disease. The disease? Love. Lena has read horrifying stories of those that \\"died because of lost love or never found,\\" which frightens her the most. Her mother had fallen ill with the disease after her husband died and was not able to be cured, which worries Lena. She reads about these stories in The Book of Shhh (The Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook) which is widely consulted among citizens and lists symptoms of the disease, the dangers of it, and such. It was interesting to read snippets of it at the start of each chapter.<br /><br />The world Lena lives in is pretty restricted with curfews for the uncured, random neighborhood patrols, raids, keeping a certain distance away from the opposite gendered uncured, and staying within the boundaries of the city. Beyond the city and into the woods, Invalids live within \\"The Wilds\\". Invalids are those that choose not to be cured and don't seem to be living in the safest conditions.<br /><br />Lena wasn't exactly likeable since she was trying so hard to be practical and conformant at first, but you could relate to her and I grew to love her throughout the story. I also loved her free-spirited friend, Hana and a guy she later meets - Alex. Looooved Alex! He was... he was... I'll just insert **SWOON** here! Loved this story and I'm definitely going to be reading Hana (Delirium #1.5) next and then Pandemonium (Delirium #2) soon!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Tried the free version and liked it so i bought the paid app.  Has an issue when changing versions where I lost my home screen widget and couldn't get it back but uninstalling/reinstalling fixed that.  Works great on my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket.  The stock TouchWiz calender widget just sits there on the screen.  I was spoiled I guess by my HTC Evo and its widget.  I wanted to be able to click on the day in the calender and directly access that day's events.  This app does that and more, plus its highly customizable.  Well worth the full price.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Why did they really jail Thoreau? Capote is the story of an American legend. Anyone that has every taken a creative writing course knows the way it goes. This film adds details, depth, and dialogue to the classic story behind a classic story. A brutal murder. A Trail. The death penalty. In the middle of it all: A love story. All throughout the process the author Truman Capote interviews the murderer and writes the renown book In Cold Book. The only thing more sensational then book is the story behind it. A very historically interesting and literally inspiring movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does an outstanding job playing Truman Capote. This performance is certainly in a league of its own. Capote tackles an extremely eccentric storyline with tact, thoughtfulness, intelligence, and style.

1250006341|3.0|This is a lovely book.  It's full of photographs and beautiful paper, and well chosen fonts.  My main problem as I'm reading it has been the awkward layout.  With every page turn, there is a photo with a caption, quote or side story, and in some cases there will be a new side story taking up two pages.  They're always interesting, which has left me trying to figure out what to read first.  Do I skip the side stories and read the main text until the next logical stopping point?  Or do I read the fascinating snippet or mini feature?<br /><br />I kind of feel like I'm on Facebook while I'm reading it.  Everything's interesting but I am getting confused by all the chatter.

B007HJ91HU|2.0|I'm sure I'm biased because I saw and loved the original. I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed by Kenny Wormaid as Ren, or Julianne Hough as Ariel, or even Dennis Quaid as the preacher dad. Miles Teller as Willard was great. The accents were generally bad. I was bored through most of it. Choreography and dancing were great - but a lot of it was the same as the original. I didn't buy Kenny as the outsider bad boy. Pretty disappointed.

Cheers!  I will keep lappin' it up!
B0012X6FR6|5.0|Most critics correctly cite Bill Evans original, short-lived trio, with the bassist Scott Lafaro and the drummer Paul Motion, as the best trio of his career (and perhaps, of all time). That said, he still had some other fantastic trios; the first one was just the best.<br /><br />However, most critics cite the live sessions from the Village Vanguard, originally released as the albums \\"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\\" and \\"Waltz for Debby,\\" as the best recordings by this trio. Those two albums are certainly the most democratic recordings of the trio. The wonderful bassist Scott Lafaro is given free reign to take long solos on those recordings, but his solos are more sparse on the studio- recorded \\"Portrait in Jazz.\\"<br /><br />However, because of my own personal taste, I prefer \\"Portrait in Jazz\\" over the Village Vanguard recordings. This is because, as good a bassist as Lafaro is, when I'm listening to a Bill Evans recording, I really want to hear Bill Evans and his interplay with the other players.<br /><br />I admit that I'm not a big fan of bass solos, especially long bass solos. I like to hear the bass in conjunction with other instruments. But by itself, the bass, even in the best player's hands, still sounds too muddy for me to enjoy it for very long.<br /><br />This is why I don't appreciate the appeal of the Village Vanguard sessions. In theory, I understand their appeal: everyone in the trio gets the chance to shine. But for me, this appeal only works theoretically. In practice, I mostly just want to hear the piano. Which is why I prefer \\"Portrait in Jazz.\\"<br /><br />So if you enjoy long bass solos, get the Village Vanguard sessions. Otherwise, \\"Portrait in Jazz\\" is the album to own. I promise you won't regret it.
1612130585|3.0|This book is well-written and the story of the two main characters getting to know each other and the revelation of Christian's past is absorbing.  I enjoyed the banter between Ana and Christian, especially in their emails.  Very clever.  I also enjoyed the humor and found their interactions and their struggles to learn their boundaries in a new relationship to be very real.<br /><br />However, the explicit sex ending in Ana's multiple orgasms every few pages gets old quickly.  I realize they are a new couple but the entire book is fight, make-up sex, bonding time, more sex, Ana over-thinking the relationship, another fight, make-up sex...etc.  I wasn't sure whether this was meant to be a romance or porn made for women.  I ended up skimming through the sex scenes and that quite literally cut the book in half.<br /><br />Someone previously mentioned the book's similarities to Twilight, and I noticed it too.  You have a protagonist who is drop-dead gorgeous yet oblivious to the fact even though every man she ever meets wants her.  She's  never had any feelings for anyone except this man she meets in a chance encounter and he's never felt this way about anyone either.  Added to this, she doesn't find herself worthy to be loved by this man and holds back on committing herself to the relationship because she can't be enough while at the same time opening herself completely on an emotional and physical level.<br /><br />Ironically, a recurrent theme of the book is how damaged Christian is because of his self-loathing and his inability to believe that he can be loved by anyone, yet Ana has those same doubts about herself and is supposedly his model for \\"normal\\" and is the one \\"bringing him into the light.\\"<br /><br />I was interested enough in the characters to want to know what happens to them, but far too often, I found myself pulling away from the story, thinking, \\"and then they had sex...blah blah blah\\"

I liked King's early work (Salem's Lot in particular) but grew tired of his writing after a while and stopped reading him. Boy, am I glad I came back.

B000I2J2WM|5.0|I fully agree with the other five star reviews concerning the cinematography, however I must add that this is the last great movie that captures open wheel racing, that is to say open cockpit for the driver.  Soon after this era the cars changed dramatically with the introduction of the Porche 917. The racing depicted here is much more visceral for both driver and spectator.  Gee I wonder why they don't make movies like this anymore.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|War Horse is by no means a bad movie. It was well acted, well scripted, and in many ways a deeply moving film. But if you are a horse lover (as I am) it will likely be difficult for you to watch.<br /><br />The movie follows a beautiful Thoroughbred named Joey through various phases of his life. Unfortunately, the horse has a very difficult life, changing owners numerous times and going through some really harrowing experiences. I thought perhaps some of the ugliness of war would be toned down since this movie will likely appeal to a wide audience especially because of how the ads play up the bond between the horse and the boy. While there's not a lot of blood and gore, it is still very violent and it is very much a movie about war.<br /><br />I could not adequately express my issues with this movie without discussing a couple of scenes within the movie, although I have tried very hard to leave out any major spoilers.  If you would like to know what kinds of scenes made this difficult for me to watch, read on (*Mild spoiler alert*):<br /><br />One of the first war scenes depicts a cavalry battalion (with Joey being towards the front) ambushing a group of unsuspecting soldiers. A group of 100+ soldiers on horses rush toward the encampment and cut down several soldiers, some of them in the process of shaving and getting dressed. But there are machine guns hidden in the trees and almost the entire battalion of horses and riders is cut down by machine gun fire as they head towards the trees. Only a few horses (Joey included) survive. This was a very difficult scene to watch and countless dead horses on the ground gave you an idea of how badly horses generally fared in wartime situations.<br /><br />There is another very difficult scene to watch in which Joey is running away from a tank and runs in a blind panic over and around several bunkers.  He eventually runs head long through several strands of barbwire. He gets so bogged down in the barbwire that he flips end over end and is completely unable to free himself. It was heartwrenching and terrible to watch. However, the scene that follows was one of the most moving of the movie (I'll leave out the details).<br /><br />One of the tired, but true, war adages that came to mind while watching this movie was \\"war is hell.\\" This proves to be true for pretty much everyone in the movie, especially the horse. While this was a good movie in some respects, it is definitely not one I enjoyed watching.  I hope this review helps others like me who may not enjoy watching a horse endure the ravages of war.end and is completely unable to free himself. It was heartwrenching and terrible to watch.

B0000029DD|3.0|Folks, I just don't get it. I tried. I even bought a second copy a couple of years after selling my first one, thinking perhaps I had mis-judged this \\"great work of art\\" and would enjoy it more with a more open mind. But the second time around wasn't any more impressive. I'll buy into the \\"remarkable voice\\" aspect of Jeff Buckley, or at least the fact that he sings with passion. But the bottom  line for me is the material here: the songs are just not that great. Some decent material, but what's to rave about? I feel bad that Jeff passed away so soon. He seemed capable of producing some great music in the future. But honestly, to my ears this album is just not the classic that so many people feel it is. To each his/her own, I guess.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|This should not have been attempted. Crushing Le Carre's classic spy story into just over two hours required the sacrifice of so much content, tone, character and continuity that this new Tinker comes across as hasty, hard to follow in places and remarkably featureless considering its provenance. There's just no time for anything more. While Oldman is decent enough as George Smiley, he does not have the gravity Alec Guinness brought to the role in the miniseries -- given the distant, almost uninvolved way Alfredson shot this, he's not permitted to do so -- and, honestly, there's just too much missing, too much changed around or added to no useful purpose and too little atmosphere. (Scenes that were fraught with tension in the miniseries are perfunctory or simply inept here.) Moreover, the script too often lacks the fierce, literate crackle of Le Carre's dialog -- as though the writers were desperate to disassociate themselves from the novel and miniseries (which used it extensively) but unable to supply something equally memorable in its place. Everything's been trimmed-down and lopped-off as if by an over-zealous gardener -- not least the memorable character of Bill Haydon, whose complexities the film does not begin to explore.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Ken Follett's THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE is such a compelling well-written story, that it seems a shame to mention the one weak spot in it, which involves an unbelievable plot twist.<br /><br />But first, I should like to tell you something about it. The title refers to a German spy who was working behind British lines during the second world war. His nickname is Die Nadel, or the needle, because he is about the only spy that the Germans have working for them who is not a complete amateur.<br /><br />This seems hard to believe, until one realizes that when the Abwehr (German secret intelligence) was re-organized in 1938 by the head of the agency, Admiral Canaris, he took care to surround himself with hand-picked men who were not members of the Nazi Party. The reason? So that he could engage in various plots to assassinate Hitler.<br /><br />Thus, Follett's character Die Nadel, the brilliant and ruthless Prussian aristocrat fulminates against the amateur blunderings of his compatriots sent over to Britain to do some mischief on behalf of the Nazis.<br /><br />Which brings me to the problem with this wonderfully taut novel. Why in the world, does Die Nadel act as he does just before the end of the novel? (I don't want to be more specific so as not to spoil it for future readers). It seemed so unmotivated, and it spoiled the ending for me. Four and a half stars.

0061969656|2.0|I am a huge Bernard Cornwell fan. With the exception of the Sharpe series, I've probably read and thoroughly enjoyed at least a dozen of his novels, and certainly all of the Saxon series. I thought The Burning Land (Saxon #5) was terrific and I waited in great anticipation for Uhtred's next adventure. What a disappointment! I can hardly believe that Death of Kings was written by the same author. I'm not going to get into the details of why the book was such a let down; I'll only say that never in my wildest dreams did I ever expect that I wouldn't be able to finish a Cornwell novel. But with Death of Kings, it happened! Please Mr. Cornwell; you are a great author, but if you are tired of this story please move on to something else.
B006UG90RM|1.0|This album is terrible, much much much worse than Van Halen III. It gives me the impression that VH is back for money, not for music. I do not know why so many people give it 5 stars.

B003Y5H5FG|1.0|Do not believe any of the reviews above 1 star.  This movie is awful.  It's NOT smart, it's NOT sexy, it's NOT scary.  It a huge waste of time.  I was so disappointed in this movie, after reading all the reviews on here.  I spent 4 bucks on a used copy, and I still feel like I threw 4 bucks in the street.  I cannot believe Colin Farrell and Toni Collette actually agreed to be in this movie.  DO NOT buy this, wait for it to come on free TV.  And then only watch it if there is nothing else on TV and you are hard up for something to do.  Trust me, this is one lousy movie!!!!
B004RKXNDU|1.0|I had looked forward to an intriguing, cleverly written novel.  For page upon page all I read<br />was reminiscent, chatty discourse as if it was the only way to fill a page.

B006ZJJ6XW|3.0|I cannot match Mr. Stenroos' close textual analysis of this set although I think his hyper-inspection of some details misses the overall impression that Leinsdorf's Beethoven achievement can convey. This is Beethoven from an early Romantic perspective, mostly objective in its rendering of the scores, with few interpretive liberties, flights of fancy, or rhetorical underlinings. Some symphonies respond better to this treatment than others, notably the Fourth and Seventh. The Ninth is exciting with a Toscanini-like intensity, and the cool Fifth and Sixth amaze because of their restraint. Only the Third is negligible, which is surprising given Leinsdorf's thrilling Rochester recording from a decade earlier.<br /><br />What I can comment on is the sound refurbishment. And I think Mr. Stenroos is incorrect here in his assessment. Yes, there seems to be a meshing of primary and secondary voices, so that everything registers the same. But it's the 24-Bit mastering that has created this flattening of perspective. In comparing these issues with the original LPs, the Victrola CD releases, and some of the Navigator CDs, I have found the sound in this latest set to be even worse than the Dynagroove LPs: louder, thicker, and flatter. Most shocking, the poorest-sounding LP, the 1963 Eroica, is livelier, more dynamic, and more revealing than the 2012 24-Bit digital release!<br /><br />RCA/Sony could do a better job with the sound, and with the overall presentation (No notes, inconsistent identification of recording dates, no biographies of performers). As for the performances, Mr. Stenroos and others can argue over details in the score which Leinsdorf respects, ignores, or interprets idiosyncratically.

Powering through it within a few days, it was very hard to put it down to go to bed for school the next morning. The idea behind it all is great, the epic story is amazing and I happily picked up the following books.<br /><br />Rereading it as an adult, I'm still just as giddy, following Ender through his experiences and trials during battle school and on. This truly is Science Fiction at it's best.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is one of my all-time favorite novels. Set in 1960s New Orleans, it tells the story of Ignatius J. Reilly, a pompous, self-important, obese slob who still lives with his mother and has delusions of grandeur while constantly being shocked by the state of the modern world and half-heartedly attempting to keep a job and write a novel.<br />Based on this and Toole's \\"Neon Bible,\\" it's a tragedy that he passed away so young, as we'd lost one of America's great novelists before we knew he existed.<br />One of the finest aspects of the novel is Toole's remarkable ability to convey the particular patois and accent that belongs specifically to Southeastern Louisiana, and more specifically, New Orleans.<br />Rarely has a book actually made me laugh out loud, but \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" did just that several times. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.<br />So many authors are always attempting the proverbial \\"great American novel.\\" With \\"Dunces,\\" Toole may juat have accomplished that feat.

B006ZCWTV0|4.0|But it is no Darkness or Born to Run.  Without a doubt, Darkness on the Edge of Town is Bruce's best album, IMO, so you know where I am coming from.  This is almost a return to the days of the very early 80's and back through The River, BTR, The Wild, The Innocent..., and Greetings.  It's good, it's real good and the more I listen, the more I like, but to me, there is no comparison to Darkness.  If I could have given it a 4.8 or 4.9, I would have, with, of course, (will he ever shut up about how good Darkness is?) Darkness being the full blown 5.

B005KELW26|4.0|I was excited to find this folio for my Fire!  I like the streamlined design, the sleek magnetic closure (which I hope holds up!) that so far is working really well, and it is a beautiful color!  My only big complaint is that the 3rd day I had it, I pulled it out of my purse to find that the \\"Durable, premium, leather-like finish\\" had somehow got a big inch-wide hole of it peeled off!  Just being in my not-too-full purse.  So, thumbs down on quality of outer finish & durability, but thumbs way up for design, utility, & visual appeal.

And the music - you could turn off the picture and enjoy the whole movie just listening to it.<br />If you've never seen it, rent it.  Once you rent it and watch it, you'll want to hit Amazon and buy it!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Really enjoyed the book. I was not a fan of Clayton at all, from the first moment you met the guy. Logan seemed like a bit of a tortured soul and I was happy that he found what he was looking for and more. I can't say I liked that in the end it seemed as though Clayton saved Ben when in reality he did nothing of the sorts, but I guess that is how the author wrote it. We shall see how the movie portrays that. I was also hoping that Logan would have been a little more \\"developed\\" as a character, but the book was not long enough for that.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was not my typical read, however, I am glad that I did have the opportunity to read it. It was an unusual book...at first I couldn't believe that I was reading about kids killing kids or that this was marketed for young adults! Once they kids started training for the games I admit that I enjoyed the story. It was fascinating the way this \\"world\\" worked and how the hunger games were meant to keep the citizens in line and punish those that go against the capital and the wishes of those higher up. I loved the highly intelligent way that Katniss thought, planned, and plotted, BUT to me Peeta was the more likable character. Peeta and Rue kept reminding us that these were humans not animals and that they wanted people to remember them for their character and not their ability to win the games. Several times during the games I was disturbed to think that their eventually would be a winner, but what would they have won...they would always be reminded of what they had to do to come out on top. I don't know if I will read the next two books in the trilogy...I probably will, but I think I need a break from this intense storyline before I go back to it.
159514188X|4.0|I used this book as one for my thesis paper. It shows how a snow ball effect continues down and ultimately lead to this girl committing suicide. My thesis was based on how teen literature can be used in the classroom to approach subject matter that is sometimes hard to speak of; i.e suicide, rape, etc... This book covers many of those aspects. Jay Asher wrote an exceptional book and at the same time pointed out the fact that what one does can effect many lives. I handed this book off to my daughter when I was done because I felt it held a very good moral.
B002SAS26E|5.0|This game is fantastic.  When I first introduce it to people they are skeptical.  At first glance it just doesn't look that interesting.  But, after the first play they are always hooked.<br /><br />The game plays quickly with very little down town.  But, there is plenty of strategy/thinking/pushing-your-luck packed in the short play time. You can turn in your card early and grab a high valued token.  Or you can hang on to your cards and try to collect more (3, 4, or 5+) to acquire the valuable bonuses...but, with the hand limit of 7 cards you may have to keep passing up scoring opportunities in the process.  And don't even get me started on everything there is to think about in terms of camel collecting and exchanging. And yes, there is also plenty of luck involved as well as you never know which cards will be made available to you or which cards you may make available to your opponent.<br /><br />The game is made for 2 players but there is a 3 player variant that we play that works just as well.  The only differences are as follows: each player starts with 4 cards instead of 5 and the game ends when either the deck runs out or 4 of the stacks (instead of 3) of goods tokens are gone.<br /><br />I am so glad I purchased this one, and you will be too!

B0052U59F4|1.0|A poorly written exercise in wish-fulfillment from the biggest Mary Sue who ever Mary Sued, after Bella Swan. Considering it started out as a Twilight fanfic, I am not surprised that nothing actually happens in this story, aside from loads of 1st person angst. BellAna does not do anything, aside from fall instantly in love with a perfect billionaire and constantly nag him justify his sexual inclinations.<br /><br />The one bright spot was the emails.<br /><br />The erotic scenes veered from almost decent to terribly bad. The lip biting, crooked smiles, inner goddess, and subconscious were AWFUL.<br /><br />I've read several self-published stories that started out as fanfics, before the authors re-worked them into original fiction. They always falls flat because these stories may make sense in the fandom universe they were created for, but don't have the strength to stand on their own. There is not enough going on in FSoG to make a convincing story because nothing really happens.<br /><br />SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br />SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br /><br />Beauteous Ana, from a relatively normal background, made it to the ripe age of 21 without masturbating? What bizarre Puritan universe have I stumbled into? Christian became a total pushover. I thought he spent 5 years being tutored by an adult domme and then trained 15 women on his own? Why does he give up so easily to Ana's whims? She can barely handle a light spanking, why would he let himself be pushed into the final scene of the story? If Ana really believed that he had an abusive childhood, and (in her mind), he was sexually abused as a teen, why would she constantly badger him to talk about it with her, within days of meeting him??<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, the location said Seattle but it was obvious the author lives across the pond. Write what you know! This could have worked better if placed in the UK. Some of the dialogue choices were truly awful:<br /><br />\\"His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.\\"  (For real?)k melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.\\"  (For real?)
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The walking dead comic/graphic novel is better. Over all an ok zombie read. I liked some of the storys, but too political for my liking and did not have a good ending, guess you can know the ending from the start, but when I finished it, I was let down. If you want a really great zombie story, read the walking dead. Way better than what AMC is doing with it on TV. I rate it 3 out of 5 on the zombie scale.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I will be upfront in saying that John Carter is not the best Disney movie I have seen.  But if you like your movies with tons of action, where your senses are on total overload throughout the entire duration, then John Carter is for you.<br /><br />John Carter is based on a series of old novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs which tells the story of Confederate war military caption John Carter (played by Taylor Kitsch) who by happenstance, goes on an adventure that it truly out of this world.<br /><br />In the story, Captain John Carter is a honorable man who has dedicated this military career to helping to protect western settlers.  But he ends up losing his compassion after tragic events happen in his life.  Now disillusioned, he vows to help no one.  But in his quest to find gold, he discovers a medallion that takes him from Earth to Mars (also called Barssom) where another war is going on between two cultures - the Zodangans and the Helimites.  The Zodangans plan to wipe out the Helimites with the help of a strange blue power given to them by Martai Shang (played by Mark Strong), the King of an advance race of people called the Therns.  The Therns can change apperance at anytime and blend into any culture to alter the course of events as they see fit.<br /><br />Carter is initially captured by a group of four armed, green creatures called Tharks who are just waiting for the Zodangans and the Helmites to kill off each other off so that the Tharks can take over Mars.  To end the war, the Helimite princess Dejah Thoris (played by Lynn Collins) has been pledged in marriage to Sab Than (played by Dominic West), the evil king of the Zodangans.  But Dejah runs away to save herself from a loveless marriage and ends up meeting John Carter.  Carter finds that by helping Princess Dejah, he can heal himself from the past and maybe find a new life on Barssom (Mars).<br /><br />The main problem you will find with John Carter is that there are so many characters, and storylines, and cultures, and languages, and plot twists and turns in the movie that it is all a little too much for the audience.  It's like a wild 3D video game where the audience is on complete overload for two full hours trying to figure out what is going on while enjoying all the 3D effects.  This movie may have a complex storyline because Disney is staying true to the original books. Since I have not read any of the stories, I am not sure this is the case.<br /><br />But despite the complexity, John Carter is a spectacular movie to watch.  The 3D was beautiful and the fight scenes are grand and thrilling.  My son was engaged for the entire two hours - there is no way that anyone will be bored while watching this movie. Most of the movie is computer generated graphics that show a make believe Mars (Barssom) that is visually wonderful to watch containing complex flying machines, intricate cities in the sky, and epic battles.<br /><br />And the movie does not take itself too seriously. There are moments where John Carter does things (like learning to walk on Mars in zero gravity or going to the wrong city when he attempts to save the princess) that make the audience burst out laughing.  And there are so many fight scenes in the movie that at one point even Carter makes a joke out of fighting yet another epic battle.<br /><br />For parents, even though John Carter is a Disney movie, it is rated PG-13 for a good reason. There is plenty of cursing in the first 30 minutes of the movie. And the movie is full of violence from beginning to end.  If your children are use to viewing video game violence, then they should be fine with seeing John Carter.  But just a warning that there was one scene involving a branding iron that was particularly hard to watch.<br /><br />My son totally enjoyed this movie, even though the end was so complex, he (and a lot of other people in the audience) were scratching their heads trying to understand it all.  The way the movie ends, a sequel to John Carter will probably be in theaters in the near future.<br /><br />John Carter is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters TODAY, Friday, March 9th.  If you are going to see it, please pay the extra money to see it in 3D.  It is totally worth it.r will probably be in theaters in the near future.<br /><br />John Carter is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters TODAY, Friday, March 9th.

B005NF2UE6|5.0|This is Nickelback's best CD yet!  I always wished they would go a little harder with their music and now they have! I like my harder rock and before this album, they had a few great songs, but a lot of lighter songs.  This time they went heavier....fantastic!  This album is awesome!  I can't stop listening to it!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad that I read it.<br /><br />The author brings the emotions of not being able to conceive a child and adoption to our attention.<br /><br />It is always interesting to read of different cultures & traditions.

I would recommend this book to everyone.

B006QS0KO6|5.0|Everyone should read this thought provoking book.  How does a story so short stay with you so long?  I wont,  as other reviewers have,  try to explain the psychological or allegorical meanings of the story for you,  even though I do have my own theories,  because I know once you read the book you'll be thinking and theorizing all on your own.  READ IT.  NOW.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is the most realistic movie for showing the relationship between enlisted, nco, and officer I have ever seen. Although I was in the Army for 30 years, I worked with the Marines in Mogadishu, Somalia and I find this movie to be amazingly true to life in the simulated combat scenes. The relationships shown between the marines and the one airman mirror what I saw in the 10th Mountain Division in Somalia.<br /><br />If you want to see what really happens when soldiers go to combat, this movie shows you. If you want to see a fantasy that bears no resemblance to real life then watch another action movie. Face it, our military join up, for the most part, because they believe in our country and each other. They learn discipline and faith in both the chain of command and each other. If you believe that soldiers do not act like the actors in this film, then please do not join the military and never try to rise above the fashionable self interest that is so evident in our society today.<br /><br />I find it sad that critics of this movie label it as \\"cliche\\" or \\"stupid\\". It takes a real intelligent person to demean the love of ones comrades in war or the ability to see a goal above oneself.<br /><br />If you want to see why our military win wars, watch this movie. Fiction? I stayed in the military for thirty years so I could see this behavior every day.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was really excited about this book and had pre-ordered it. It wasn't quite what I thought it would be as I assumed it JFK would be a huge part, not just the main goal of the character; nevertheless, I was surprised at how it unfolded. It's a beautiful story, not what I'm really used to when it comes to King novels.<br /><br />The end seemed really rushed, a little bit of a let down. The whole novel is great though and I recommend it!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I have to say I loved The Forever Girl. From the beginning to the end I was hooked. I don't think there is anything I could say negative about it if I tried. To me the best read is one that hooks you in the beginning and keeps you hooked. I am talking the kids are eating pizza and the laundry can wait. There were so many twists and turns, questions and answers, and questions without answers. I was glued to my Kindle.<br /><br />I think I liked the best because that it was different than other paranormals that I've read. It was fresh and new.  The story moved at just the right pace, not to fast, not to slow. The romance between Charles and Sophie was what you'd expect with a young adult not really experienced with relationships. That to was great, it was realistic. One minute your thinking are they or aren't they? I cannot wait until the novella comes out and the next in this series. Its definitely one I'm going to be following. I'm hoping that the next ones are even better than this one, if that's even possible!<br /><br />I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
0439023491|1.0|NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games,\\" and was really excited to dive into the second book.  It didn't take long, however, before the disappointment set in.  After all of the action and adventure in the first book, it took the second book about 13 chapters before anything of interest happened, and it didn't last long.  I was actually bored reading the book.  My advice would be appreciate the first book for what it was, and just leave it at that....the 2nd and 3rd books are all downhill.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|I am so glad to have found this book. I needed all the help I could get. I was tired of housework! I was tired of the mess!I was embarresed to have anyone come into our home. I am a nice person why couldn't I do better. After reading this book I found things I could do to change my mind set on what I felt was hopeless. Now my home is beautiful. I am a happy girl again. I clean with my broom instead of ride on it. This book breaks down tasks into small doable jobs. It is encourageing all along the way. It was fun to read and fun to see my sucesses. You will not be sorry if you get this book. Even us old girls can do new things and find better ways of blessing our family and our homes.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I just saw \\"John Carter\\" and I liked this film very much! Long long time ago, when I was a teenager, I read some of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels in the \\"Barsoom\\" series (Barsoom means Mars in Martian language) and I enjoyed them greatly. And thanks to this movie, I just relived again this experience and I could enjoy a little bit of the old magic. Burroughs books about Tarzan (he created this character) had quite a number of movie adaptations, but his Martian and Venusian series were considered for a long time too hard to film. Considering that the first book was written in 1912 and that the first plans to film it were made (without success) in 1931, it certainly took time to have a movie version of the first of \\"Barsoom\\" books - but considering the result, it was worthy waiting that long.<br /><br />Below I tried to describe the best things in this film, with as little SPOILERS as possible.<br /><br />1. John Carter from Virginia, a former captain of Confederate cavalry. For my personal taste Taylor Kitsch pictured him quite well, and the scenario describes him like in the book, as a man courageous, strong and aggressive but also noble, faithful and clever. Unlike in some other action movies I found this hero quite LIKEABLE - he is a little bit grim and sullen in the beginning, but we soon come to understand why and frankly he has reasons to be in such a state of mind. His progressive awakening to a second chance in life is credible and a pleasant thing to watch.<br /><br />2. Dejah Thoris from Helium, the Princess of Mars. Actually, the first book in \\"Barsoom\\" series, of which this film is the adaptation, had for title precisely \\"A Princess of Mars\\", as Dejah Thoris is a character as important as John Carter. In the film, in my opinion her character completely steals the show and it is in large part due to the excellent performance of Lynn Collins. Whoever cast her in that role was a genius! Her Dejah Thoris is an excellent mixture of an Amazon (courage and strength), a scientist (brains and learning) and an aristocratic young lady (pride and manners), like in the books.<br /><br />But it is not all. Lynn Collins added to all this a personal touch which made Dejah Thoris also a very feminine character, in the best sense of the term. Although she can swing the sword and pilot the warships as the best male warriors of her country, she also can display a moment of girlish cheerfulness and enthusiasm, smile in a way which melts the hardest hearts, give looks filled with an almost motherly warmth and tenderness (and also a purring promise) and walk in such a way that all males in the assistance are almost howling! I particularly appreciated the fact that when sharpening her sword she simply couldn't resist to look on the blade, check her make up and preen a little... And then, there are short moments when we perceive a brief glimpse of vulnerability - and at that moment she is even more impressive.<br /><br />The fact that Ms Collins is a very beautiful woman with an exceptional figure only adds to her performance - also her clothes, body paintings, haircut, makeup and jewelry were perfectly well chosen! And I really believe that her model of wedding dress should be MANDATORY on Earth - the number of men willing to marry would probably explode overnight as the result! Frankly, when she appeared in her wedding dress, the male part of the public gasped - and in the same time many girls in the cinema started to emit noises similar to those made by a very angry rattlesnake when choking on a half swallowed chinchilla...)))<br /><br />To resume, Lynn Collins pictured a Dejah Thoris so PERFECT and so faithful to the one imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs, that I had a feeling of \\"Dejah Vu\\" (sorry, I couldn't resist...)<br /><br />3. The Tharks, desert warriors. Excellent. I found every scene with Thark tribe a delight. The characters of Tars Tarkas and Sola are very well done and played. The Woola \\"dog\\" is simply too cute and extremelyfunny - every scene when it appears was welcomed by a big laughter in the cinema.<br /><br />4. Other special effects. This film was very costly and you can really see the effects on the screen. The mobile city of Zodanga, walking through the desolate deserts of Mars is really impressive. The flying warships are excellent. The gigantic White Apes are really impressive and scary. The city of Helium is very beautiful. And finally, the panorama of Mars is really well done - one can immediately see that this world was once full of life, but it is now dying and in dire need of help...<br /><br />5. Dominic West. He plays a scoundrel - again. I must admit that I have a weakness for this actor, since watching him in \\"The Wire\\", but also the \\"300\\" and \\"Centurion\\". Here his role is not as important as it could be, considering that he is not exactly THE main villain (it is not exactly a spoiler - we learn it in the first scene of the film). But it is still a pleasure to watch him.<br /><br />6. Difference with the books. There are many small and one HUGE difference with the \\"Princess of Mars\\", concerning the race of Therns, who in the book do not play an important role - in the \\"Barsoom\\" series they really appear in later books. But I believe this HUGE change for once was a rather good thing, as it allows for a more logical explanation of John Carter's travels from Earth to Mars. The smaller differences didn't hurt the movie either.<br /><br />7. The ending is quite good, not stupid at all and rather moving. And that is something not so frequent in modern Hollywood movies. Good job for this one!<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked this film a lot and I am certainly going to buy it as soon as it is available - preferably in Blu-Ray, because here the quality of image has its importance. And I will certainly go to see the sequel if there is one, for many obvious reasons but especially because I am DYING to see how they would solve the little problem of Martian reproduction - because you see, in the books, when John Carter and Dejah Thoris are married, she lays him an egg...)))funny - every scene when it appears was welcomed by a big laughter in the cinema.<br /><br />4.

B003K16P3M|5.0|The title would not have caught my attention, but after picking this up based on a recommendation, I found myself very pleasantly surprised.  Set in a medieval world where individuals with two different colored eyes are born with extreme skill in a particular area (everything from baking to swordsmanship), Graceling tells the story of Katsa, a girl graced with fighting.  The prose were beautiful, the characters engaging and the plot logical although not predictable.  I was mildly disappointed by the one sex scene, since it means it will be that many more years before I would hand this book to my daughter, but otherwise I loved this book.

1118156315|5.0|I've been experimenting with lifestyle hacking for several years but it's just recently that I've understood how to separate the value I provide from my key activities - both in focus and in pricing. It has freed up a lot of time, created better results and more interesting projects.<br /><br />I read BMY yesterday and it really accelerated my thinking, especially how I visualize and talk about the value I can add. I've always had the idea that business model generation could be applied to the individual as we are gravitating towards the entrepreneur-of-one. It's great to have this book as a platform for discussion and to empower individuals to design their lifestyles from passion and not only necessity. This is a great tool to reinvent your life and design your desired lifestyle.

I cant wait to see what the locked games are because if its anything like the first page of games I'm really going to have fun. I just downloaded it today and I love it.

0553381695|5.0|I just voted this as my Best book in the A Song of Ice and Fire Series.<br /><br />I finished the 4 book paperback set and Clash of Kings really threw me. I couldn't believe some the plot line twists and turns. It is never easy to guess what will happen next.<br /><br />It was so compelling, wonderfully written, and never without action. The amount of detail Martin provides is astounding.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I look forward to learned which book others may consider as the \\"BEST\\" on the bestions site
B007FH9GT2|5.0|I thought this movie would be sci-fi.  It is not at all what you expect.  The adventure is quite good, the suspense is not overdone.  I rented it twice and noticed things in the second showing I missed in the first.  It's a good thriller, but you leave wanting more because you never quite figure out why she has tattoo's and where her story is going.  Fantastic thriller!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very good and easy to use makes reading the Bible daily easy. Ideally like the Bible reading plans. There are slot of plans to choose from.

B007F39498|3.0|I like Bruce and have listened to multiple songs of this album and thought they were okay. But in a day age when much poorer musicians are having new releases sold at 5.99, it seems rather hypocritical for an artist like Springsteen, whose whole spiel is writing songs about the economic struggles of modern America, to have a premium price attached to any of his music. Touring this year Springsteen and his band will be earning millions of dollars. Given this fact, the album and all of Springsteen's other works for that matter should be priced at a more reasonable amount, somewhere in the five to seven dollar range. Four bucks may not be much of difference, but that is beside the point. Music doesn't cost what it used to to produce anyway; therefore, the price of albums should reflect this as well. C'mon, give the American customer a break, Boss. Isn't it about time someone did?
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is a breeze to set up and allows access to just about anything on your Pc without issue.

B0000DJYO1|5.0|Generally acknowledged as the quintessential Deep Purple album of all time, every track on this is a winner!<br />As a vinyl fan, I LOVE this Rhino reissue.  Better than the Canadian pressing that I have and rivals the SACD release which I also own.<br />Rhino are VERY consistent in their vinyl quality (in my experience) and deserve major kudos for this.<br />Excellent remaster that you will cherish as a high point in all of Classic Rock!
1451683405|4.0|An excellent book overall, simply because it takes a very controversial and heavily argued philosophical subject and distils it down very quickly to some short, clear, crisp arguments. Sam Harris makes a strong case that 'free will' (as we commonly understand it) is an illusion, but also that this does not necessarily negate our basic moral outlook on life. I found myself convinced by many of the arguments, but like all good freethinkers should, Mr. Harris also gives clear descriptions of some popular arguments against his position.

0345472322|5.0|The idea of mindset and its importance regarding achievement can have huge implications in the field of education.  As a nursery school director/teacher, I am cracking down on teachers saying \\"You are so smart!\\" and the like; instead we are focusing on efforts.  I wish I had read Carol Dweck's research when my own children were quite young.  I can see how their fixed mindsets in certain areas hold them back.  I would be interested in learning more about exactly when mindsets are formed and how to help young children develop a growth mindset.<br /><br />Although it is true that there is just one basic idea in this book which is repeated over and over again, in defense of Dweck I must say that it is a pleasure to read anyway.  She is a fine writer, and her illustrations of mindset in action in the areas of business, sports, academics and the arts really helped me to better understand her big idea. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to parents, coaches and teachers.
1451683405|3.0|I am certainly a Sam Harris fan and have been trilled to read most of his writings, blogs and watch his speeches/debates.  His prior writings on the subject are quite thought provoking and nearly had me teetering on the fence of my own internal understanding; however, this title seems a bit safe and unconvincing, not so much as to leave me teetering but to actually give evidence to his contrary.  Although, as always, his writing style and method is flawless, terribly engaging, and well suited for the general audience it fails to go much deeper than things I have already pondered and researched.  I was surprised to see that nearly every one of the chapters ended with some version of \\"although you have made choices and actions, you simply cannot account for where they came from.\\"  This thesis quickly felt very tautological and is not exactly an answer to the question being posed.<br /><br />I won't go into my own specific philosophical and logical issues I had with his thesis, but will simply say I thoroughly enjoyed giving it a chance, as anyone interested in the topic should.  It was a good row, but I would say it is somewhat unconvincing.
1583334386|5.0|I selected this book because I thought it might have some suggestions about how I might help my nursery school students. I wasn't exactly sure how to apply her lessons in the classroom, but after a while, that wasn't my objective anymore anyway!  I actually tried some of her suggestions myself and what a difference it made in everyday willpower struggles.  McGonigal's mental exercises have really given me much more control over my urge to procrastinate, eat junk food, and shrug off going for that walk.  I loved the anecdote about Leo Tolstoy and the white bear.  It's true!  The more you try not to think about something, the more you keep thinking about it.  Kelly McGonigal shows how you really can get out of this trap, and helps with many other common willpower pitfalls. The book is easy to read and well organized.  You will probably want to keep it handy as a reference until her lessons become automatic.
1400079144|5.0|The 3rd of the trilogy and I liked it more then the second book. I love the science vs religion and mixing of the two...though admitedly I am not religious in the sense of the word. It is a refreshing and respectfulness that this character and I relate that makes him so endearing to me. The authors description of historical places and explanations and meaning makes you fall into a spell of enchantment. It was a very interesting and cool look into freemasonary rituals. It had my mind spinning until the very end. I cannot wait to read more of his work.
0955153077|3.0|When I first learned this book was going to be maded, I couldn't wait to get it! I bought it at my local bookstore and I have to say, it's a good book!<br /><br />It gives precise informations about digital painting which is better explained than in their other books such as Digital Painting Techniques. It can be a good book for beginner's but I feel they should explain even more stuff. Give even more steps for the REAL beginners. Espacially for the tutorials they give which can be problematic for real beginners who has trouble having a working knowledge of how to use photoshop.<br /><br />So, in overall, It a great read but they should have dumb it down more for real beginners.<br /><br />And another thing, the author of the book uses Photoshop CS. He give good advice but I use Photoshop CS3 which gave me some trouble to find certain things he talks about. The windows, the names, placements and the settings are different in the two versions and I gept getting this window saying an image or a PSD doesn't have the same settings than photoshop which is annoying.<br /><br />A book that I strongly recommend that is usefull for a beginner is ''Digital Character Painting Using Photoshop CS3'' by Don Seegmiller before or after reading this one.
B000FA675C|5.0|I watched the movie and then read the book so there were a few moments or rereading, but I think of course as always the book was better. The movie of course was perfectly cast with Tom Hanks and throughout the book series I could only hear his voice as I read teh books. The thread in which the writer thread to make this scavenger hunt that you desperately try to unravel as a reader are so in depth you wonder how this cam to him. This cryptex idea. And all of this imagery was perfect. You could see it as if with your own eyes. Of course since I had watched the movie I pretty much knew what was coming next. But that didnt keep it from being a page turner for me. I read it in a week.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay, a former District Attorney, is a gripping read that combines parents' struggles to protect their son, Jacob, and the quest for truth in a murder of their son's 14-yr.-old classmate.  They are actually afraid of the truth because they think Jacob may be the murderer, but do not want to admit it--not even to each other.  To complicate things further, the father is the assistant District Attorney who is on the case, until he is replaced because the District Attorney believes he is too close to the case and may have a conflict of interest.  Between the family drama and the court drama, this book is hard to put down.  When Jacob is arrested, the mother feels guilty and second guesses their parenting skills while the father chooses to protect his son and defend him to the end no matter what.  Even though the kid is on trial, the parents lose most of their friends too.  The story is told in first person from the father's point of view which helps the reader understand his thinking and gives insight into the struggles he faces.  The ending is shocking and I did not see that coming!<br /><br />I liked this contemporary murder suspense very much because of the way it was written.  I was never certain as I read if Jacob was really the killer or not, which is what the dad felt.  At first, I thought he wasn't and as the evidence piled up, I thought he was.  I'm not telling you if I was right or wrong because you really need to read it and see for yourself.  This book is thought-provoking because as you see a well-respected, man of integrity tamper with evidence and obstruct justice to protect his son, you can't help but wonder what you would do in that situation.  This is a great read that I highly recommend to both adults and teens!
B007BVNW10|5.0|This is a great new series with fantastic characters. I didn't want it to end, and I can't wait for it to restart up.  Great storylines and surprising season ending.

B006H3MIV8|4.0|The power of Dylan's body of work is proven by the breadth of artists wanting to participate. Some highlights - Zee Avi,Carolina Choc Drops, and particularly Floggy Molly. I'd like to think Bob would tap his foot to their \\"Times they are a changing\\" cover. However, it's not all good - why someone didn't pull Carly Simon aside and say \\"let's rethink this\\" in regard to her cover of \\"Just Like a Woman\\" is a crime.

B005LAIH3G|3.0|Well I just got home from seeing the movie.  I must admit that I never had the pleasure of reading the books, but a friend had praised them to me and got me really hyped for this movie.  The premise seemed fascinating and inspired.  Knowing that the books were written so long ago, was also very impressive to me.  I was ready to be taken on an<br />awesome adventure.<br /><br />The movie was moderate fun, but really nothing special.  I didn't pull my heart strings.  I wasn't wowed by the visuals.  I don't know how much this is owed to the written source material or the Hollywood determination to change things, but the world of Mars just didn't look all that special.  I didn't even have much of a red tint to it for goodness sake.  I thought vehicles and architecture were somewhat bland and looked like they had been pulled from the inspiration of the crappy look of the Star Wars prequels.<br /><br />The acting was decent and the human cast was easy on the eyes, especially the princess of mars.  I don't go into movies expecting the world, but this fell short of what I had allowed myself to expect.<br /><br />For most people I would tell you to wait and rent this one or catch it at your \\"discount\\" movie theater when it's at the end of it's run.  I think people who have an intense love for the source material can make themselves like this movie a little more than the rest of us, or they can mourn over whatever changes were present.  My friend that is in love with the books seemed very pleased with the movie, while the rest of our 12 person group found it just \\"ok\\"

0393061310|5.0|There are abundant reviews of this abundant book.  What interests author Diamond is why societies succeed or fail.  Probably most of us are more interested in why \\"we\\" succeed or fail.  And the conventional answers are usually self-serving and inadequate.<br />As an author, Diamond's biggest asset is his extraordinary scope.  He starts with a conversation with a very bright native of New Guinea, who wants to know \\"why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"<br />Diamond reviews human evolution, culture, geography, history and language.  He goes back 11,000 years, to the end of the last Ice Age.  He looks at the \\"blessings of civilization\\" with admirable detachment.  His answers are wide-ranging,  well-reasoned and challenging.  For openers, he explores reasons why New Guineans, and others, are smarter than Westerners!<br />He starts with a summary:  \\"History followed different course for different peoples because of differences in peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\"  In proving this point, I expect you to find his interdisciplinary approach exciting and illuminating, possibly humbling.  When you read this book, you will better understand why and how you became smart.  You may even become smarter.
0761169253|5.0|An creative, easy read that feels like an inspirational kick in the pants to make something and \\"do good work.\\" If you're stuck in a rut, want to be more creative or just graduating college, this is a must read.
B005SJIP2S|4.0|Adding Benoit and Oliver Wakeman during this time period was a good fit, at the time. They are no longer, but The CD is actually recorded better than most LIVE YES CD'S. It is engineered clearly and sharply. Wakeman is a much better keyboard player than he was allowed to show, but filled in good. He shined on Starship Trooper. Benoit David did pretty good considering who he was replacing. The pace just seemed a little slow at times, but new live tracks were played, as advertized, from Drama, and a couple from the beginning of the YES ERA. I struggled with the line up changes at first, but they do have to carry on, and this is CD captures another chapter in the evolving YES saga. The band has changed members again since this release. We will see what that brings in 2012

B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD was fun and I liked the mix up, but after a few weeks, my knees started to suffer from the many squat excersises. I weigh about 250 so I know that had something to do with it. I'm reviewing this as a warning to all others in my weight range. Though it was fun and kept me going, it was not worth it for me. I stopped doing this DVD 3 months ago and I still have problems with my left knee. I DID NOT have knee trouble before.
0385535139|2.0|The first half of the book kind of feels like it was written by someone other than JG. The style and writing quality doesn't fit with John Grisham's earlier work. He is entertaining and light, pretty much using his perfected formula of believable scenarios, wit, legal knowledge and suspense to draw the reader in to a well spun yarn.  But the first many chapters seem out of step with reality on too many levels. I barely know Chicago but this setting doesn't really feel like it. The characters don't feel plausible, except a few aspects of the secretary and David, the young burned out addition to the firm. But the gears don't quite mesh with the storyline and and characters don't really ring true or believable.<br /><br />The scene of the accident in front of the seedy office might serve as an example of what I'm trying to convey. None of it quite fits, right down to Zinc's nonsensical part in it. The reader soon realizes it's just a gimmick. The tedious descriptions of David's Lost Workday seem goofy, not artful. However, About halfway through the book I more have the sense that I'm reading Grisham. The wit and courtroom-weaving seem more like what I remember; the tempo picks up a little, but the overall pacing and yarn-spinning are not quite like work from years past. The early character depictions are caricatures; the later descriptions yield slightly more depth.  The modern-day Dickensonian type of satire of the tort system finally appears, but the timeline is not always consistent and the reader at times doesn't know for sure when days, weeks or months have passed.  It does move along much faster toward the end, and overall I'd say it's an entertaining novel with some flaws.

1449529259|4.0|I did find this book helpful, however, I found his writing style a little hard to follow. I found he rambles a little. That isn't to say his writings are not intelligent. He was an extremely erudite man who was well up on the philosophies and thought fads of his day. In his late 40's he converted to Catholicism and here gives some defense of religion in general. Mainly I find his point is top say that rationalism and logic doesn't answer all of man's questions. This is exactly what I had wanted to hear, and was looking for some reading that addressed that topic though I didn't know where to look. I do believe I was led by our Lord to this book. And through this book I have begun to think differently about things. That life itself and not just religion holds both logical and illogical standpoints. This paradox is what is found in religion, and religious people should not be afraid to admit. Even the most staunch atheist must admit that ultimately he cannot even absolutely prove his own existence, never mind the existence of the universe! We live in a world of faith and probability, and I believe that probability is strongly on my side when it comes to the existence of God, the Resurrection of Christ and the Church which He established.<br /><br />Another book I would recommend though Protestant in nature is [[ASIN:0785242198 NEW EVIDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT: Fully Updated to Answer the Questions Challenging Christians Today]]. I do not agree with it all, and as with everything you must read it with an open mind. But this book has been a great help to me of recent times just as it was when I first committed my life to Christ.<br /><br />If you read this review, please pray for me that I may remain faithful to our Lord until the end of my life, that I may stand confident in His presence on that day.

0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />My major problem with this book is I don't understand what happened to Katniss Everdeen. Her character not only doesn't grow, but regresses. Throughout the series, we kept hearing that she \\"just doesn't know the effect she can have\\". Well, after the conclusion of this series, I don't know either. The Katniss in the first two books may be thrown into situations beyond her control, but she refuses to back down. She makes her powerful anti-Hunger Games statement wih her treatment of Rue. She shows her refusal to be a pawn of the Capitol when she takes out those berries. In Mockingjay, she spends most of the time moping around or filming propaganda films. I kept waiting for her to realize her power or to truly step up and \\"become the Mockingjay\\", but she NEVER does.  In this book, she all but abandons Peeta. She leads her team on a pointess mission to kill President Snow, leading to the deaths of almost all of them, which becomes all the more obvious when the rest of the rebels arrive at Snow's residence at the same time she does. If she hadn't been so selfish at that point, she could have arrived at the capitol with the rebels and saved her team and probably her sister as well (you know there is no way she would have let her sister go on that mission). I understood that when she told Coin that there should be another Hunger Games, she was just playing for time, but shooting Coin could have been the perfect time for her to truly become the Mockingjay. For her to make SOME kind of statement. Instead,  she is taken into custody where she half-heartedly tries to starve herself. This is not the Katniss of the first two books. This is NOT that Katniss that people were looking to and willing to die for. Where is the Katniss that Cinna was \\"betting on\\"?  Where is the Katniss that  the people of District 11 were willing to flout the Capitol for, in order to give her a salute? I seriously hope that when they make the movie of the third book, they completelychange it up to truly give us a strong character (even if flawed) that we can root for. Like another reviewer mentioned earlier, I was hoping for a female Frodo or Harry Potter, but instead, she just became more and more a pawn.<br />I know a lot of the people who are giving this better reviews think that those of us who are disappointed are just unhappy with who Katniss ended up with in the love triangle.  I don't think that is true for many of us. I actually had no preference over who she ended up with. Both Peeta and Gale had their strengths, but I always figured that in the end, she would end up with Peeta. My problem is with the way it was \\"resolved\\". I don't think the author stayed true to the characters.  I have a hard time believing that the Gale who protected her family and his for so long would have left Katniss alone for so long in this book. Other than a brief hunting trip at the beginning, they are hardly ever together.  And to imply that it is his fault that Prim died was such a cheap cop-out (and it could be argued that is was just as much Katniss's fault since she was not there to protect her sister while she went on an unauthorized mission to kill Snow). I also don't believe that Gale would have just left her to go off for a \\"fancy job\\" in another district, no matter what had happened. Katniss never actually MAKES a choice - its more like it is decided for her. Peeta is the one who comes back. I wanted a strong Katniss who could make a decision for herself, but instead ended up with a girl who just let things happen to her. Such a let down after such a powerful start.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I was very pleased with this app.  it is tun to play.  ( and its good tht its free!!! )
B006ON41FC|5.0|its a really fun game i give it 5 stars at the least.. it gits kind of addicting after a while.and you just want to git more and more acorns than you did before
B00005JNQA|2.0|The story is fine but I find the acting terrible. Sean Penn has just one facial expression throughout: a solemn wrinkled forehead and dead pan. Kidman keeps forever getting her hair to cover her right eye. These mannerisms drive me nuts.
B006BQM762|2.0|Guess I was expecting a real sci fi movie but this seemed more like a kids growing up dealing with issues type movie ... with a great train wreck scene thrown in.<br /><br />Bleh ...
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The production, at least in its early portion, emphasizes spectacle at the expense of the dialogue and relationships. In fact, the music is so loud and the camera movements are so distracting, that much of the famous dialogue is lost.<br /><br />Still, the novel is so good that the kitchy, chintzy production still leaves me moved and very happy to see the happy endings for the two couples.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent books! Keeps you guessing, with many different plots and twists. Strong character development that makes you love and loath them. Excellent style of writing - very adult, this is no teen \\"twilight\\" series....far from it. This is one of my all time favourite reads...if not #1.  If you want to be swept away into another world, with a little myth and magic, knights and lords, backstabbing, cunning, good vs evil, mystery with plenty of action....I would highly recommend these books.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book wasn't as good as the first two, but this book definitely wrapped everything up. I had no questions left when I was done with it. It was altogether very good. This autor did amazing work with this three book series.  :)
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I'm a World War II buff, so I was really looking forward to this min-series.  I was expecting The Pacific to be even better than Band of Brothers, given the advances in film-making technology since that mini-series came out.  What I got instead was a dark, cynical look at America's war in the Pacific.  The marines portrayed in this mini-series are racist, emotionally fragile & morally bankrupt.  Throughout the mini-series, the Japanese are referred to as \\"yellow bastards\\", \\"yellow monkeys\\", \\"yellow slants\\", or \\"slant-eyed bastards\\".  Oh, and then of course there was my favorite line: \\"We're here to kill Japs, aren't we?\\".  Now I'm not saying that there weren't Americans with racist attitudes towards the Japanese.  I'm sure there were.  The problem is, Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg are saying that racism is what defined our war effort against the Japanese.  They're implying that our goal was to eliminate them as a race.  It's as if Hanks & Spielberg went over every episode with a fine-toothed comb (with the exception of the episode that takes place in Australia) & said, \\"Do we have someone making a racist comment?  No?  Well put one in there!!!\\"<br /><br />One of the main characters is Robert Leckie.  Roughly half-way through the first episode, he is on a troop-transport ship off of Guadalcanal.  His company commander's pre-landing briefing is nothing more than an epithet-filled tirade.  Really?  That's how you prepare your men to go into battle?  You don't tell them about what kind of resistance they might face when they land or how many Japanese soldiers are on the island?  Nothing about the tropical diseases that they might have to deal with?  The scene would be comical if it wasn't so pathetic.<br /><br />What we also see is marines going crazy when faced with hardships.  Leckie actually winds up in a madhouse.  A minor character named Gibson is in the same madhouse after he tries to kill himself.  Now I'm not saying that the marines didn't face hardships fightingin the Pacific theater.  They had to deal with things that soldiers in North Africa & Europe never had to face.  It's all a question of perspective.  For every marine that cracked up, there were many more that kept it together.  Hanks & Spielberg chose to focus on the former & not the latter.<br /><br />On Peleliu, we see marines digging the gold out of the teeth of dead Japanese soldiers.  There's even a scene where a marine tries to dig the gold out of the mouth of a Japanese soldier who isn't dead.  The Japanese soldier begins to struggle.  The character of Shelton (i.e. Snafu) calmly walks up to the marine, pushes him out of the way, shoots the Japanese soldier in the head & says, \\"Makes it easier.\\"  Did things like this actually happen?  Yes, I'm sure they did, but again, it boils down to a question of perspective.  It's as if Hanks & Spielberg are only trying to show the very worst behavior that the marines engaged in.<br /><br />And then of course there are the gratuitous sex scenes.  Now I'm no prude.  I have no problem watching two people simulate having sex as long as it serves the story.  The problem is this: You're doing a ten-part mini-series about the marines who served in World War II.  Each episode is only 45 - 50 minutes.  Why are you devoting so much time to sex scenes?  In Band of Brothers, there was one sex scene in the second-to-last episode that lasted maybe 20 seconds.  What, do think people who watch HBO are that starved for sex?  How many billions of dollars does the porn industry rakes in every year?  You couldn't think of a better way to use that time?  I guess character development wasn't high on the priority list for this mini-series.<br /><br />One of the main characters is Eugene Sledge.  In the final episode, he is shown coming home from the war & having nightmares.  He tries to get his life back on track by going to a college that is having a registration day.  A girl sitting behind one of the registration desks begins asking him questions about his qualifications.  When it becomes clear Eugene isn't quite measuring up, the girl finally asks him if the Marine Corp taught him anything useful.  Here is his response: \\"They taught me to kill Japs.  I got pretty good at it.\\"  There is a subtle yet insidious message here: Not only did America fight a racist war, but she left her sons unprepared for life once the war was over.  This message is patently false, given that both Leckie & Sledge went to have very successful lives after the war, as did many Pacific veterans.<br /><br />Another issue I had was with the night-time sequences (in particular, the battle sequences).  Yes, I understand that it was very dark & the creators of the mini-series wanted to make it look as realistic as possible.  However, there's also an entertainment factor to be considered.  And it's difficult to be entertained when you're constantly saying to yourself, \\"I can't see what's going on.  The screen is black.\\"  I found it to be very frustrating.  Another problem was with the pacing.  For example, in the first episode, we see Leckie saying goodbye to his father at a bus station as he heads off for boot camp.  The next time we see him, he's on a troop transport ship off of Guadalcanal.  Well what happened in between?  What was Marine Corp boot camp like for him?  Did he get in trouble with his drill instructors?  That would have been more interesting to see than the gratuitous sex scenes.<br /><br />Anyone who didn't know much about World War II would come away from this mini-series believing that the Americans were the bad guys.  So why would Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg - two men who are supposedly great admirers of WWII veterans - do a mini-series with such a negative tone?  I think the answer can be found in comments Tom Hanks made during a Time magazine interview when The Pacific came out in 2010: \\"Back in World War II, we viewed the Japanese as `yellow, slant-eyed dogs' that believed in different gods. They were out tokill us because our way of living was different. We, in turn, wanted to annihilate them because they were different. Does that sound familiar, by any chance, to what's going on today?\\".  What Tom Hanks is referred to is the way many Americans view Muslims today.  Mr. Hanks, like all of leftist Hollywood, believes that Americans want to exterminate all Muslims because they are different than us.  In other words, the way we view Muslims today is no different than the way we viewed the Japanese 70 years ago.  It was wrong then & it's wrong now.  And how best to communicate that message?  Do a mini-series like The Pacific.<br /><br />The World War II generation is passing into history.  Of the 16 million men & women who served, only about 2 million are still alive today (with about 2,000 dying every day).  They've been referred to as the greatest generation.  I don't agree with that assessment.  To me, the greatest generation was the one that gave our foundational documents (i.e. the Declaration of Independence & the Constitution).  The World War II generation was an important generation with one major flaw: They gave birth to the baby boomers, perhaps the most selfish & self-righteous generation of Americans.  And who are two of the most prominent member of the baby-boomer generation?  Yep, you guessed it, Tom Hanks & Steven Spielberg.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very good. It definitely left some cliff hangers but it had a very good story with plenty of adventure.
0517548232|1.0|Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -<br /><br />The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.<br /><br />There is no difference between supply and demand.<br /><br />The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.<br /><br />It is all very simple; listen to me.<br /><br />If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.
0439023513|3.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />This is the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  I was completely blown away by the first book (well aside from the writing style itself) and the ideas that it presented.  And as such, was very eager to devour the next two books.  The second book proved to be lackluster, and this one followed in its footsteps unfortunately.  It provided a decent ending, but after the Hunger Games, it just didn't have the excitement the first one did.  And if you haven't read the first two books yet, don't go any further, go give them a read!  This is not a stand-alone type of book.<br /><br />Katniss is now with the rebel District 13, but Peeta is still trapped by the Capitol and President Snow.  She isn't sure what she wants to do and wanders around aimlessly while everyone tries to convince her to be the \\"Mockingjay\\" and a symbol for the rebellion.  When she finally decides she has to do something for Peeta's sake, she still isn't sure how she feels about it, but she gets back into the swing of things and tries to make a difference.  But it could cost her so many things that are important to her life.<br /><br />Katniss is always pretty unlikable.  But in this book she's unlikable in the bad way, not the unique way.  She just doesn't have very many redeeming qualities at all.  Gale too isn't the greatest of characters.  I almost feel like they deserve each other.  Even Peeta isn't written as brilliantly as he was in the first two.  He's a mere shadow of himself and while some can argue that's the point, I think it could have been done better.  I did like reading about the people of District 13 though, there's was an interesting culture.  And I actually liked President Snow in this book.  Finnick and some of the other side characters were remarkable as well.  So maybe I'm just the weird one.<br /><br />Whereas the 2nd book moved too slow, this one moved too fast.  Too much going on, not enough description of the important things.  And the last part of the book felt like a dungeon crawl in some sort of role playing game.  It was just stiff and didn't flow naturally.  And its all still told through Katniss' eyes.  And she's not the best narrator.  I think a 3rd person perspective would have given this series so much more.  Even the world building aspects would have been better.  Like the other two books, there is a lot of violence in this one, but at least its realistic violence, even if it is gory.  I don't want to spoil too much, but I think the end was well written and believable, so that saved this book a little bit too.  The concepts are fantastic, its just the execution that could be worked on.<br /><br />Not the best ending it could have been, but at least it was something.  I can tell you, at the very least, I'll probably reread the first book a few times over.  An interesting series to be sure.<br /><br />Mockingjay<br />Copyright 2010<br />400 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Bought this for a planned trip to Europe I am planning in May.  So far it seems to work as advertised. Simple interface.
B0058VW36U|4.0|this is really fun but a lot of the levels I had to skip because they were really hard over all I like it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Ive always been a huge fan of solitaire and this game satisfies that all familiar game combined with a few twists making this a more challenging highly addictive game than regular solitaire. You can also choose how challenging it is by picking how many suits to play in Settings (the more suits the harder the game). I sm hooked and play at least once a day! And its a free app so its a must have especially for tablets.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is exactly what I was looking for to protect my Kindle Fire, strong, lightweight, without adding bulk, and the price was right.  The ability to have it sit up is a plus but not what my main objective was, which was to protect it from bumps and scratches. But I have found if I rest the long edge of the cover under the elastic strap, roll it in the opposite direction, it sits at a lesser angle and is more stable.
B004LROUNG|1.0|This book is such a disappoinment, 31% of the way through and nothing!  A good guy hates his job and quits?  Wow!! Very sad when my reality is more exciting than the 12.99 book I bought to be entertained.  I can't --I just can't spend anymore time hoping JG will add some spice/adventure/anything that interests the reader. Save your money!
B005OMOKN2|5.0|Great battery life and it's a good idea to have a back up for the things you use everyday. Fast shipping  and processing.
B000X1R4S2|5.0|This is a great book.  is long but you will enjoy it. if you liked the movie. i guarantee you will like the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is just like the real one at church.really it is I went to church right afther I got it.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|Pretty good movie with Jason Stratham, if you like action movies you will like this movie, keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Beautiful edition. I liked all of its content. But how to store CDs, is a joke, mine came loose, scratched.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|An interesting book that starts rather innocently, but evolves into a disturbing tale.  Although I am not sure I want to continue reading the book, it has captured my interest & will be completed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is an awesome app. wish it would work even without Internet connection...just to read if you wanted to. I love the audio reader, nice and clear. from time to time it even has a pop up that asks if you would like to spend a few moments relaxing your Bible which is a great reminder in the hustle and bustle of everyday life...it does this maybe three or four times a month, so not annoying.
B004EPZ0AM|3.0|\\"If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours.\\" When Mumble's (Wood) son Erik begins to question if he has talent or not he meets Ramon (Williams) and the amazing flying penguin Sven. When Erik's dream is to fly Mumble tries ways to let him know that he can't fly. After an event occurs that causes an iceberg to trap the rest of the penguin clan it is up to Mumble, Ramon and the rest of the group to save them all. I liked the first one but was never that crazy about watching it again. My favorite part was Robin Williams (he is great in pretty much everything though) and the music was great. Like most cartoons lately it got a sequel (weather they need one or not). This one once again falls into the same category as the rest of the latest cartoon sequels. They try to add a more grown up story and focus less on what made the first one so fun to watch. This is a good movie for kids but there is something missing to make it as good as the first one. I do have to say that the Krill played by Brad Pitt & Matt Damon far and away stole the movie and was the only part I really enjoyed. Overall, not a bad movie but it's missing all the stuff that made the first one fun to watch. My kids liked it but started to get bored towards the end. I give it a B-. My kids give it an A

1934356557|4.0|When I start reading the book I was a little reticent about it, and the first chapters didn't help much.<br />The naive tree anti-pattern has an alternative that I can consider a BRUTAL anti-pattern, and ID required was simplistic to only considered the downside of it.<br />But then the book started to show its value, with some great chapters and really common anti-patterns. The reading is easy and it shines in some chapters, mainly on Part I (logical database design) and Part IV  (application development).<br />Some anti-patterns seem to be very basic mistakes, but they are anti-patterns and nowhere this book says that it is an advanced anti-patterns book. It's a great reading for the novice and intermediate professional, and has nice chapters for the experienced one.<br />In the end was worthwhile spending some time reading it, even having some points I disagree with the author.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|After hearing all the great reviews and comparisons to Harry Potter, I couldn't wait to get to the top of the waiting list at my library and download this book. But the whole time I was reading it I kept thinking, \\"I'm going to really get into this book any minute now!\\" I never did, and as the 21-day expiration date loomed ever closer I had to force myself to finish.<br /><br />Total. Letdown.<br /><br />I'll give the book two stars for putting my Kindle Touch's dictionary to use; I learned some new words. I must also give the author credit for her ability to paint a scene. I really could see the circus, but it was far from engaging. I almost get the impression that Morgenstern would have rather painted a beautiful picture of this circus, but instead of using a brush and canvas, she decided to simply describe the painting to us. And, like a painting, nothing ever happens and the characters are totally flat. I was bored to tears.<br /><br />As I submit this review, The Night Circus has a solid four stars overall and tons of five-star reviews, so people are clearly enjoying this book. I wanted to be one of them but it just wasn't for me at all.
006197806X|5.0|This is a great sequel. I cannot wait to read the third book in the series. Lena is a thought provoking character and the end of the book will make you anxious to read the next book!

B005RDF2NA|5.0|We loved it because we love shrek!! Great movie an very entertaining needed it in our library!!! Definetly a great buy.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I like this product it works very well for the price that I paid. Initially I bought it as a temporary case in hopes to purchase a sturdier and much more protective case that costs more. For now I am satisfied with this one because it hasn't given me any troubles so far (I haven't dropped it as yet I hope not to). I do love the subtle design also because I am not a fan of all the other crazy designs.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This is a great movie for all little girls definetly a MUST see classic! No problems with quality , loved it!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was informative and well-written.  It really helped me to understand my introvert daughter.  It is a must-read for teachers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This ebook (I bought it for my Kindle Fire) made me lose a lot of sleep. I found myself struggling to stay awake late into the night because I couldn't put it down. I have never read anything like this before. Ms. Collins has a storytelling ability that far outshines any other author I've ever read.  Her characters are beyond engaging - they're spell-binding, captivating, and they come alive! I found myself sad, angry, tearful, happy - almost every emotion you can feel, while reading this book.  I really got attached to these characters and I couldn't wait to get Book 2! I just started reading Book 2 and already I'm sucked into it. I don't want to give away any of the plot - GET THIS BOOK! I doubt you will be disappointed! This is such an original storyline, which is so hard to do nowadays. There are some moments that I wished things were explored/developed more. For instance, I'd have like a little more background/history as to how things got the way they were in Panem. And some things seem so outrageous (like the people in the Capitol) that they're hard to imagine. But even still, I found myself wanting more and more.  I will be very sad when I finish the series.  They're just that good.
0811877485|1.0|I bought this with other wall appliqu&eacute;s, and these didn't stick. Fell off really fast. The other appliqu&eacute;s have stayed on well. Very disappointed with them. Had had to use poster sticky to keep them up, but they are now curling. Not happy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far I like this game. all the ads suck but I understand why. some of the games are challenges. thumbs up
B004LWZW88|1.0|The CD was blank.  There were instructions on how to download it on my mac, but they didn't work.  We had three people try to help me do it, all in IT at different places including Apple, and it didn't work.  We got our money back, and the company paid the return postage to.  This happens sometimes, but i REALLY wanted this movie as it's one of my faves.  I will get it again later, when i get money for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I luv this game it is awesome but u wish the games were a little less points so h can buy.more
B002S0OBMS|3.0|Unquestionably one of the \\"problem\\" musicals (up there with 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE and RAGS), LOVE NEVER DIES has yet to redeem itself. The recent Melbourne production, which has just had an HD broadcast in theatres and is just about to be released on DVD, may yet find an audience for the show.<br />By now, everybody has heard the story of how Lloyd Webber's cat accidentally erased the first version of the score from his recorder piano. (Presumably a cat can harbor no ill will !), and how the show bombed in London, which led to a decision not to risk opening it at all in New York.<br />Both HD broadcast and this CD issue of the London production, prove \\"LOVE\\" to be a viable stage work. If it's tunes are not the equal of those in PHANTOM (or EVITA or CATS), they are still attractive, expressive of the drama, and generally effective in context.<br />One wishes that Lloyd Webber had stuck closer to Frederick Forsyth's novella THE PHANTOM OF MANHATTAN which was created as a scenario for this sequel. MANHATTAN introduces several new and engaging characters and takes somewhat more interesting plot options, but the current script is straightforward and effective.<br />The London cast is absolutely first rate and the sound recording couldn't be better.<br />Give this non-masterpiece a chance and you may very well find that it is better than it's reputation !
0142403873|1.0|I find it has one joke in it and it doesn't bear repeated reading.  But I'm an adult what do I know?!  Therefore it was such a releif when my children found it boring too.  Also the words just don't scan, much, much better children's books out there.

It's also disturbing that Lt. Col Mitchell gets the lead the command when Carter has been there the longest. Also, the writer chose to divide SG1 into 3 separate units during their off world crisis. Special effects are ok, but nothing more extrordinary than what we see on the tv show. This could have been a 2parter on SciFi Channel instead.<br /><br />I also usually enjoy DVD commentary on a film, this was basically 90mins of the writer/director patting himself on the back about camera angles and lighting. No insight into the story or characters...perhaps because the story was weak.
B000FC1GJW|1.0|This novel is a mess. What began as an intriguing series collapses into dead ends, unresolved issues, stereotypical baddies, and worst of all, pseudo-theological atheistic drivel. My advice? Read the first and second novels in the series - 'The Subtle Knife' at least has some kind of structure and pace, but if you want to read this kind of literature you are much better off with CS Lewis, who at the very least is undeniably coherent. Which Pullman isn't. Utter tosh.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is challenging but awesome and I wish it was less challenging so I could. play it all the time but it is still a great game and that is why I rated it as 4.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|The first few chapters were a bit long winded and I wondered when we would get to the meat of the story, but once we got there, I enjoyed every bit of this story.<br /><br />There are definitely predictable elements (like the love interest) but the big plot lines were a surprise.<br /><br />I have been a Kinsella fan for a long time and this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Fast-paced, funny, and full of heart!
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|I read the game of thrones book and really loved it.  However there is way too much nudity in the HBO series for me to watch it in good conscience.  There was even more nudity than was described in the book!  Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to watching this series.... The nudity is not just from the back either.  I watched one episode and that was enough.  :(  In my opinion, Game of Thrones is not appropriate for Christian viewers or people who hold to old-fashioned notions of propriety!  Wish they could release a version minus the nudity!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|I've seen many a metalhead give a mediocre response to this album. Initially mine was similar, but after given it a good few listens, I've been taken aback at how truly dynamic and and gorgeous this album is. The harmonization is executed flawlessly, to the point where the songs will stay with you long after you've finished listening, and I mean that in a good way. Listen carefully to all of the different instruments used and how well they interact with each other. I think most metalheads were expecting straight up riffs and solos, but honestly, that would've just been yet another metal album. What Blind Guardian has done here is imbued metal with a myriad of different styles of music and instruments. And it's perfect. In fact, I'd go so far to say is that it's not only one of Blind Guardian's best albums, but one of the best albums of all time. Take the time to experience every note and appreciate the amount of effort Blind Guardian has put into this work of art.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I've got to say I was very excited when I got this controller. As a former xbox 360 owner, I was having a bit of trouble adjusting to the dualshock 3 and turned to this 3rd party controller for help. I saw the mixed reviews, yet I still figured \\"Eh, it can't be that bad\\". Boy was I wrong. After connecting it to ps3 and loading up a game, it started randomly disconnecting. Thinking it was just a small glitch, I turned the controller back on and everything went smoothly until it disconnected again 30 seconds later. Frustrated, I let the controller charge for a couple hours thinking it might just be low on battery. Still didn't work. Whenever I use it, the the controller literally only stays connected for about 30-45 seconds, then it has to sync up again. Do not buy this!

0307719219|5.0|Why is it that some nations prosper, while others wallow in poverty? Why, in particular, have Western European democracies, the US, and Canada led the world in economic growth and standard of living?  Further, why is it that wealth has emerged and grown in these countries, and not in others? Until the 18th Century, the common answer was God's grace, or theories of racial superiority. Around 300 years ago, a number of European philosophers started asking these questions in a more scientific way. Bernard Mandeville and Adam Smith identified the existence of trade, specialization, markets and property rights in creating more efficient economies. But even that powerful explanation begs the question somewhat. Why is it that free markets and property rights have emerged in wealthier countries, and not in poorer ones? The answer, say the authors is the kind of political systems  that have emerged in different nations.<br /><br />In the 20th Century, a good many competing theories have emerged. Some, like Jared Diamond and Jeffrey Sachs, point to geographical differences, of differences in natural resources. But those explanations are easily discarded. The Netherlands, which has so few natural resources that it has to make land to live on and farm, was the wealthiest nation in Medieval Europe and remains one of the wealthiest in Europe on a per capita basis. Africa may be poor today, but it was once home to many great nations. Today's poverty stricken Mali was once Timbuktu, one of the wealthiest nations in the world. Great Zimbabwe, which ruled from the 11th through 15th Centuries, was so magnificent that European visitors in the 18th Century believed that its ruins must have been built by Europeans.<br /><br />The real answer, say the authors, has to do with the kinds of political institutions that have developed in different nations, and they illustrate this by beginning with the examples of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico, two cities divided by a fence that are miles apart economically. They share the same climate, the same geology, and to a great extent the same ethnicity, and yet the Northern city is easily five times as wealthy as its Southern companion. What's different is the political institutions that govern daily life is the two cities, and that difference is largely due to how the two nations were settled.<br /><br />Mexico's modern history begins in the 16th Century when groups of soldiers and adventurers set out to extract what wealth they could from Mexico by seizing the gold and silver found there, and enslaving the local population. In so doing they destroyed the exiting culture and nations, replacing them with a culture of exploitation that remains to this day. Modern day Mexico is still very much a mercantilist society not all that different from 16thC Spain. Property rights exist at the whim of the state, or those who have curried favor with the state. Monopolies are given to the favored, and courts freely exempt the most powerful from laws and contracts that would otherwise restrict them.<br /><br />Curiously enough, the settlement of the territories that became the United States began in a very similar way, with the first English settlers being soldiers and adventurers looking for gold and silver. But they encountered a very different set of circumstances than did the Spanish- people who were not so easily conquered, and who did not accumulate gold and silver the way the peoples of Mexico and Central America did. Those differences resulted in a change of strategies. The initial settlers were replaced with farmers and tradesmen who were charged not with extracting wealth, but with creating it. Those difference were responsible for the way in which the US and Canada evolved their political systems.<br /><br />The authors have compiled scores of such examples that serve to support their thesis and disprove many fashionable ones. Do geography or ethnic differences play a role in the creation of wealth? Consider the cases of South Korea, which shares a gene pool and a border with a nation that is orders of magnitude poorer. In fact, until the 1950s, the two nations were identical in just about every way. But following the partition created by the Korean War, South Korea began developing a political system more like that of the various Western democracies while the North pursued a Stalinist model. Following a political liberalization and freeing of markets in 1979, South Korea's economy grew at an unprecedented 7% per year, while that of the North- already a poor nation- continued to shrink, leading to the mass starvation that periodically plague the country to this day. Similar examples can be found in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.<br /><br />What about natural resources? Mexico and many Central and South American nations were rich in gold, silver, and minerals. Africa is rich in diamonds, rare earths, and other strategic materials. Russia is very rich in natural gas and oil, which the current regime has been exploiting to support itself, and to create a system of privilege, but actual economic growth has been declining for years. Or consider the oil-rich nations of Africa and the Mideast. The wealthiest among them have no industry, no economy save that paid for by pumping oil. They have a huge consumer culture, but nothing else. When the oil and gas are gone, there will be nothing left to replace it.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out from similar books is the mass of solid data and examples from around the world. The authors serious economists who have approached this project with the same seriousness they put into a journal article, and the list of endorsements from the jacket illustrates this- Kenneth Arrow, George Akerloff, and Gary Becker- all Nobelists- give heart praise. Even Jared Diamond, whose geographic theories are thoroughly picked apart in this book, gives it an enthusiastic endorsement.

1439170916|5.0|This is a monumental piece of work by Dr.Mukherjee, chronicling the history and biology of cancer for the layman. The prose is easily understandable and the narrative is arresting. Though it is pretty lengthy, the author keeps us engaged and interested all the way as he follows the disease from its early recorded days of 2500 BC to the twenty-first century. It is truly a biography of cancer. As the author himself says in the introduction, ' ...this book is an attempt to enter the 'mind' of cancer, understand its 'personality' and demystify its behavior'. He also uses a military metaphor in describing man's fight with cancer. Cancer is portrayed as a formidable adversary against whom victories have been won as well as defeats tasted. The various attempts by scientists and researchers to find solutions are treated as campaigns and as the author says, '..there are inevitably the wounded and the dead.'. All in all, when I finished the book, I was overwhelmed by the multiple talents of the author in presenting this biography. He is an excellent writer of popular science, has the transcending perspective of a historian and is able to talk about his subject by using apt metaphors.<br /><br />The most important things that I learnt from this book are as follows:<br />Though cancer is simply the abnormal growth of cells, it is a disease that is intrinsically stitched into our genome. Oncogenes arise from mutations in essential genes that regulate the growth of cells. Mutations accumulate in these genes in one of two ways. One way is when DNA is damaged by carcinogens and the other way is by random errors in copying genes when cells divide. The DNA damage may be preventable but the random errors in copying is endogenous to us. So, in this sense, we can say that Nature has created us with this flaw being deeply embedded in us.<br />So, what does this mean to us in so far as eradicating cancer from this world just as we did smallpox? Well, Dr.Mukherjee says that the secret to battling cancer is to find means to prevent these mutations from occurring in susceptible cells or to find means to eliminate these mutated cells without compromising normal growth. But malignant growth and normal growth are so genetically intertwined that upbraiding the two might be one of the most significant challenges faced by our species. We can rid ourselves of cancer only as much as we can rid ourselves of the processes in our physiology which depend on growth - i.e, ageing, regeneration, healing and reproduction. As our cells divide and our bodies age, and as mutations accumulate inexorably upon mutations, cancer might well be the final terminus in our development as organisms.<br /><br />No review of the book would be complete without mention of the two towering figures who carried on the struggle against cancer in the US. The first is Dr.Sidney Farber who was the father of modern chemotherapy and waged a relentless battle against cancer on the medical front. The other was a Manhattan socialite named Mary lasker, who raised social and political awareness in the fight against cancer showing exemplary grit, optimism and tireless effort. The author has done full justice to their herculean efforts.<br /><br />In short, the book is a fantastic read and it made me want to learn more on the subject hereon.attling cancer is to find means to prevent these mutations from occurring in susceptible cells or to find means to eliminate these mutated cells without compromising normal growth.

B007C7UZIG|3.0|At the time of writing the features are thus:<br /><br />\\"Product Features<br />* Get Steam on your mobile device<br />* Connect and chat with friends<br />* Shop Steam anywhere\\"<br /><br />these are the only features it claims to have, and indeed Valve did not lie. this is noticeably lacking the ability to actually browse one's own games library and therefore lacking the ability to read news or patch notes related to your games. you also cannot access the forums in any way through this app.<br /><br />I wish that the steam guard would not spam my email but instead send me a text or a message through the app, thus being both less intrusive and equally, if not more, secure.<br /><br />and finally, I also would have thought that Valve would try and sell games for mobile devices but fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your view) they do not.

The conclusion is unanticipated but makes absolute sense.  I agree with the reviewers who regarded this book as touching, moving, and \\"oddly inspiring.\\"  I would go so far as to use the word \\"elegiac.\\" Mankell has never played his readers cheap or false; he doesn't come up with pat, happy, endings.  I consider this book outstanding, and know I will read it again --- as I've read each of Mankell's contribution to the Wallander series over and over.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|When I set out to hook up a set of wireless headphones [[ASIN:B000PCEFXQ Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo Headphone]] to my bedroom TV [[ASIN:B004T1YA66 VIZIO E190VA 19-Inch Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV]] I didn't want to fool with plugging and unplugging them from the headphone jack.  Unfortunately, I discovered that like many TV sets made these days, my Vizio had no analog \\"RCA jack\\" audio outputs.<br /><br />My first solution was to order this unit: [[[[ASIN:B004C4WPXA Digital Coax & Optical Toslink to Analog Audio Converter]] .  It worked well enough, but I had a problem with the optical connector (I have since repaired it.)  I decided to give the FiiO unit a try, and I am very happy I did.<br /><br />Not only is the FiiO a nicer unit, with the very helpful \\"signal good\\" indicator led, but it also has the advantage of being powered by way of a mini-usb jack.  This allowed me to order this 12\\" usb to mini-usb cable: [[ASIN:B002L5U7N2 StarTech 1-Feet Mini USB 2.0 Cable - A to Mini B (USB2HABM1)]] and this 18\\" optical cable: [[ASIN:B000YFBOYC Cables To Go 0.5m Velocity Toslink Optical Digital Cable  (40389)]] to produce a configuration mounted on the back of my set, and powered by the TV's USB connector.<br /><br />See the picture in the \\"related images\\" section to see the result.<br /><br />If price is an issue, the [[[[ASIN:B004C4WPXA Digital Coax & Optical Toslink to Analog Audio Converter]] isn't a bad solution, but the FiiO is a nicer one.<br /><br />BTW - if you are getting a \\"clicking noise\\" instead of the audio you expected, make sure you have your TV or other device set to PCM mode for the optical output.

0812992792|5.0|When I read 1984 decades ago, I generally thought of it as science fiction. Now, having read The Orphan Master's Son, I no longer think of it as science fiction. It exists in North Korea. Imagine living in a world where the government attempts, and largely succeeds, in controlling everything including your private thoughts. The story told is fiction but the place in which the story occurs is real. And given what is taking place in the world today, very relevant. The story has already been summed up well by other reviewers'. I won't add to it. Some of the criticism is that the story has too much torture and sometimes bogs down. Also the main character dramatically changes who he is. This change, at first, can be confusing. If the story were told in a different country, not North Korea, it would be less interesting. The criticisms would be more relevant. But this novel is about life in North Korea. From that perspective, the story is both fascinating and disturbing. Every high school/college student in the United States should read this book.  This book reminds us of the evil that exists in the world and the valuable rights we have as citizens of the United States.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I just saw the John Carter film, and I have to say, being a HUGE Edgar Rice Burroughs fan for well over 35 years, this film captured the essence of the Mars series.<br /><br />Although in true Hollywood fashion the film was much different than the original 1st novel - A Princess of Mars - it still managed to get a lot of things right. The filmmakers took several of the concepts and put them in the 1st film, and actually managed to do a credible job. Unfortunately, for people who go to see this film and don't know what the mars language terminology are or means, they may get a little lost. For ones such as I, then they are in for a treat!<br /><br />Director Andrew Stanton and his crew DO manage to create the look and feel of the long-awaited John Carter of Mars movie. The actors are excellent. Especially Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris and Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas. Although Taylor Kitsch did a swell job, I'd much rather have seen Hugh Jackman tackle the role of John Carter. But Taylor did a solid performance.<br /><br />The director did an outstanding job of crating the old-fashioned pulp sci-fi/fantasy feel of the film, while injecting state-of-the-art special effects. The overall look of the film is tremendous.<br /><br />At heart I am a purist when it comes to my boyhood novels and comic books come to life on film. I usually hate it when filmmakers change the scripts they make into films are so vastly different. Rarely do they get it right. (The latest Conan the Barbarian is a perfect example!)<br /><br />And making a huge film like this from a literary giant such as Burroughs, (Yes, he was wayyyy before Tolkien, even!)was not an easy task. But, this time around, they get a hall pass from this gigantic fan. Stanton and his crew kept a lot of the heart of the Burroughs books, and much of the storyline in the 1st book.<br /><br />I hope this movie is a success. It deserves to be. Why? Because you can see that the director had his heart and soul in this, his very first live action movie. For a first-timer, he tackled a major sci-fi/fantasy movie. Not an easy task. He must have balls of steel. And, for the most part, he pulled it off.<br /><br />This begs for a sequel. Because for you people out there that don't know any better, the ending of this film, where John Carter goes back to mars, has him not going back to the arms of his beloved Dejah, but lost in the wilds of mars, where many years have passed, and his beloved wife and son are in extreme danger - as is the entire planet of mars.<br /><br />Now THAT would be a sequel that would not only withstand the age of time, but of movie audiences.

The bonus DVD was much better in it's sound, where Eddie, Alex, Dave and Wolf are doing a studio acoustic version of some of their earlier titles in Black & White format. Eddie really kicks it throughout this album, as does Alex. Wolfgang on bass rocks also! Let's just say Diamond Dave isn't the strong one here, but oh well.  I've always been a Hagar fan! By the way, I'm listening in true stereo mode, not surround sound. I wish so much, that this recording was as good as earlier Van Halen albums. If it was, I'd go for the five star rating, because very, very, few guitarists in the world of rock come close to Eddie Van Halen!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is a must have in any collection of music. The entire album reflects it's composer as it only gets finer with each listen. His writing cuts to the bone, his voice eases us into pain and tells us how to accept it's existence. So much so we return for more. Buy it.
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|I loved this book - raising a lot of ethical questions and really felt for Anna. I'm glad I haven't seen the movie, as I believe it is quite different.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Risking her life, challenging the establishment and manipulating a no win situation was just not enough for Katniss to achieve a return to a normal life.  Winning her turn at the Hunger Games is just the beginning of her effect on her world.  Another can't put down volume.
1591844096|5.0|\\"Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?\\" by Seth Godin is a book that everyone should read. If you have ever doubted yourself or chose the easy road instead of following your dream, this book explains why. And, it challenges you to change that. Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I will say that these are my favorite books that I've read to date. The emails are the best parts, I laughed out loud so much. I also loved that there was so much interaction between Ana & Christian. However, there are a few things that really bother me. There are also things I just don't understand. Any in sight would be greatly appreciated.<br />These will be all out of order but I'm typing what's coming to mind first.<br />Leila: the fact that he paid for her classes and everything else, especially when C &A were married.<br />His jeans in the playroom, if I were Ana, he would have to get new jeans, toys etc. In the playroom.<br />Why does he still want to take her to the playroom or do any D/s with her if the reason he does it is because he likes to beat the the you know what out of little brown haired girls like her?<br />Maybe its that I don't get the whole Bdsm thing. I loved this book on so many levels. There were just so many things that never clicked. Maybe because I read all 3 so fast.

0439023491|5.0|Sequels by their very nature cry out for a third book. They are a bridge from the beginning tale to the end tale and as such too often stand as only a tease, a slight reflection of the stronger more sustained first and third novels. For every Godfather Part II there a dozen or more Empire Strikes Back. Even in the great Tolkien tales there is no doubt that The Two Towers is the weakest of the the Lord of the Rings.<br />Catching Fire, the sequel to The Hunger Games and the second book in the three book series does not fall into this trap.<br />It is a full novel with more twists than even the first and where the fast paced drama and tension of the first novel drove this story forward; Catching Fire has hit the nitro and the boost holds for the whole book.<br />Katniss is back, having just won the Hunger Games and is on her victory tour with Peeta, now rich and no longer starving she cannot forget the killing and death of the arena. Inadvertantly she begins in her way to strike back at the Capital. Her rebellion with the berries at the end of the first novel moves on and with her others take up the cause.<br />The rebellion is on!

B006L3RZ26|5.0|Yang Xuefei has shown herself to be an artist of extraordinary gifts in previous recordings - she commands an astonishing technical prowess in the service of a sublime musical sensiblity. She has surpassed herself on this CD of her own transcriptions of Bach: there is a purity of tone and clarity of structure and flow to these pieces that make it hard to believe that they weren't originally composed for guitar. Partnering her guitar with the Elias String Quartet on the concertos creates a delicate yet full soundscape, while her performances of the solo pieces are simply wonderful.

No it is not Chamber of Secrets and both parts of Deathly Hallows are the best ones. This movie does follow parts of the book, but does not follow it really good. Everyone was good in the movie except Ron. It looks like another British Actor who looks like him took his place and acts like if he didn't know who Ron is. Any time I see this movie or hear about it it puts me in a bad mood. The ones who like this movie are either people who haven't read the books or regular people. If you are huge a Harry Potter fan you will be disappointed and just read the book. If you're haven't read the books then you might like the movie.

B005VTGB0S|5.0|My girlfriend and I have both used iPad2's for the past year. We also both had Apple's Smart Cover, or at least we did until my girlfriend's cats played with her iPad and apparently lost the cover under a sofa or something. So I gave her mine and bought a Belkin sleeve ($10 on Amazon), which I like except that it isn't really functional during actual use of the iPad.<br /><br />I discovered the AmazonBasics portfolio cover quite by accident. It was immediately obvious that it followed the same design as the portfolio cover I use on my Fire. It was also obvious that the $18 Prime price was too low (and will probably be raised soon to $25-30). So I did what any bargain hunter would do, checked the Amazon Warehouse, and bought one that was \\"Used--Very Good\\" (it was essentially new) for $13. My girlfriend took one look at this cover and made me buy a second one for her.<br /><br />I guess that means the cats now have another Smart Cover to play with. Don't get me wrong...the Smart Cover can seem very nifty (albeit pretty overpriced), but the AmazonBasics portfolio offers much better protection and is a much better way to carry an iPad around.<br /><br />As I said, the design is essentially the same as the AmazonBasics Fire portfolio. That gets some pretty positive reviews, and I personally regard this particular portfolio to be better than the Fire version. But here are some specifics:<br /><br />1. Both the Fire version and the iPad version require the user to slip the tablet under elastic straps at each corner. This is somewhat difficult with the Fire because of its thickness. It's a much easier process for the iPad2.<br /><br />2. Both allow the user to use the cover as a stand. This is easy and quite functional in both cases.<br /><br />3. Both use a textured leather exterior with what seems like a microfiber interior. The leather is more like brown on the Fire. The iPad version is closer to true black. Both look elegant. Both look more like something you would see in an office than the Smart Covers we've had.<br /><br />4. It's not really possible to fold the cover back on the Fire version and have it flatten out. The cover for the iPad works better in this respect although the Apple cover is the best at this.<br /><br />5. When the cover is closed on the Fire version, it has a tendency to pop up because of the Fire's thickness. Amazon has a lengthwise elastic band designed in so the cover will completely close on the Fire. This same band is also on this cover, but the cover closes pretty well without it. For this version, the band is really just insurance for when you're walking around with your iPad. If you drop it, the cover will stay closed.<br /><br />6. This particular portfolio cover blocks the rear-facing iPad camera but not the front-facing camera. Neither my girlfriend or I have used the iPad2 cameras a single time in the past year, so we don't care about this. If we do use one of the cameras, it will be the front-facing one, for FaceTime.<br /><br />7.  One of the elastic bands covers the iPad2 power button but can be easily shifted to the side if you need to press this button. I use this button once every 3-4 months because the iPad'2's power management routines really make it unnecessary except for reboots. Others may differ with me on the significance of this point.<br /><br />8. Another of the elastic bands partially blocks the iPad2's headphone port. Headphones can still be used, but I find it necessary to shift the band enough to plug in the phones. Then it can be slid right back into place. This isn't inconvenient enough for me to downgrade my rating.<br /><br />9. The iPad2 hardware volume control is not covered up, but it is a bit more difficult to reach. How difficult depends on how dexterous and big your fingers are. Since I prefer software controls over hardware controls (a la the Fire), this is not really an issue for me. But it might be for you.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is an excellent product at an extremely attractive price. Whether it works really well depends a bit on your specific circumstances, in which case I hope my more detailed points prove useful. But for me, anyway, this was a great choice. My girlfriend agrees. I'm not sure about the cats.t an extremely attractive price.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire<br />Reviewed by Suz & posted at Under The Covers Book Blog<br /><br />'When Katniss and Peeta pick up the berries in The Hunger Games, they don't realize what they have started. They are the spark that has ignited a revolution. A revolution that the Capitol will go to brutal and ruthless extremes to suppress and end the way they did 75 years ago when District 13 rebelled. But Katniss didn't do this on purpose; she and her mockingjay have become unwitting figureheads in the fight against their oppression. But the Capitol has a trick up its sleeve and no one Katniss and Peeta hold dear are safe.<br /><br />This book was again brilliant, I couldn't put it down once I started it I got so caught up that I stayed up late into the night reading it and came into work tired and a bit melancholy the next day. If you are looking for a feel good read this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a fantastic, emotional and heartrending story with characters that come off the page and remain with you, then this is definitely the book for you.<br /><br />Although I didn't think this book was as good as The Hunger Games (the first in the trilogy) this book deserved all 5 feathers. It showed the characters getting growing up maturing from frightened children in the first book, to more mature young adults in this one. Just like The Hunger Games the writing sucks you in, it is first person POV through Katniss's eyes, but that just means you are closer to what's happening and get to feel all her highs and lows with her.<br /><br />I think the reason I preferred The Hunger Games> was because the time she spends through the games are so intense and you are learning everything for the first time, experiencing the brutality and the injustice up close and personal. And Rue, the scene when she dies in the first book was so heartbreaking, so emotional, I still get a bit teary eyes when I think about it. But, when they have to go back into the games for the Quarter Quell, it just doesn't have that impact anymore and although there are plenty of times when this book is truly sad, nothing quite comes close to the pointless, brutal and sad murder of Rue, and Katniss's reaction.<br /><br />Now the Peeta and Gale conflict, I am firmly on Team Peeta. He is just...perfect and they have been through so much together. He is kind, loving, tough, and completely devoted to Katniss, he would literally die for her, and equally she would die for him, though not for the same reasons, I am really hoping that it ends with them as a couple. Although at this point I am doubting the likelihood of any kind of conventional happy ending. I feel however, that I must put in a few words for Gale as well because I do like him, but we just don't see as much of him he is always on the periphery, so we don't actually get that much page time for him to state his case. Maybe the next book will change that, but for now I am rooting for Peeta.<br /><br />So, this is a really great book in a fantastic trilogy and I can't wait to see how it ends. Anyone who hasn't read these books really needs to give them a try, I am not normally a fan of YA, but these books are so good that they seem to ascend the usual annoyances I find with the genre.er Quell, it just doesn't have that impact anymore and although there are plenty of times when this book is truly sad, nothing quite comes close to the pointless, brutal and sad murder of Rue, and Katniss's reaction.<br /><br />Now the Peeta and Gale conflict, I am firmly on Team Peeta.

B0052U59F4|1.0|My first clue should have been the gushing interview with the woman who loved it, who hadn't read a book in NINE YEARS! This is a truly awful book, not because of the \\"kinky\\" sex, but because it is so poorly written. At best it is a formulaic Harlequin with spicy sex scenes. The fact is the sex scenes are neither sexy not sensual, but are too mechanical. At worst, it is tedious, predictable, and the lead characters are one dimensional and without chemistry. The author uses the same phrases and devices, over and over, and over. This is one of the few books I could not bother to finish.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|WoW!  That is the one word to some this movie up. The Story line, plot, setting, conclusion everything is just spectacular. This movie honors all the Seals that have fought to protect this country from Terrorists and other enemy's. The drama is limited which is a very good thing with just enough action but not to much. The narrator who is also the Chief, or leader of the Seals has a very strong and low voice which made me want to listen and kept me interested. This movie will help you understand all they do so we can live safely in our country so go see it and if you don't like it I'm going to take a guess and say your not American.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fine mahjongg app up to a point.  I worked all 20 games, and once I did that, there was little for me to fl.  I could keep on playing the same arrangements over and over again, of upgrade yo the full version, which is what the programmers had in mind.  Being on a limited budget, I could nviot afford to upgrade, so j decided to uninstall instead.  It works just fine, but I did tire of listening to the same tune over and over again, which is partly why I decided to uninstall.

Every song is perfectly presented by Adele and her crew.  Though the radio stations where I live play mostly Track 1 (Rolling In The Deep) and Track 11 (Someone Like You), my favorites are Track 5 (Set Fire To The Rain) and Track 2 (Rumour Has It).  But then, all of her songs are great.  I believe you will be very pleased with a purchase of this CD.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very entertaining read, from an author with total honesty. I am an avid fan of history, especially military history. While reading the book, you understand the sacrifices that our men and women make, not only by those serving in uniform, but also by their families back home. The inserts written throughout the book by the author's wife really added another emotional element to the book. I loved the book, and in the end, was even more proud to be an American!

B00447G2PM|5.0|This 3D Imax movie was amazing, forget the expensive price and the fact that its 40 minutes long. This is the type of 3D movie you show off to your friends and watch time after time. Its one that will be staying on my shelf, not selling back like I do with some of my 3D movies. Its definitely a disc you bust out to show off the 3D capabilities. Some of the shots were beautiful and the depth of the 3D had me in awe. As for pop outs, not many, but I find them gimmicky anyways, I like the depth of 3D that really drags you into the film. As for the commentary, eh nothing great, not bad but not great either. This is a visually stunning 3D movie to show off and watch for a long time.

0470503696|5.0|I work for a very small department with a very limited budget which is grant funded.  As our budget is quite limited we have grown to be very self-reliant.  Our need to illustrate our programming results, in a clear and demonstrable way, has grown throughout the life of our grant. In fact it has grown to the point where my personal skills with excel were not strong enough to handle the data our programming was producing. My skills have been self-taught as I needed to learn them via the help function of Excel.<br /><br />Unfortunately software does not exist which would work with our data in exactly the way we needed and our budget would not extend to hiring someone to produce a database.  I recently purchased an excel 2010 all in one text..  and other on excel formulas and functions, but it has been the text on VBA programming that has really polished up my database. Others can now do data entry and the database now has the flexibility to grow with the program.  I, and my supervisor, am thrilled with what I've been able to accomplish with this easy to understand, and use, resource.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I can't add much to what others have said about Game of Thrones - Season One, it's a very good portrayal of Martin's complex novel.  It helps to have read the book, but the series stands on it's own for the most part, so it's recommended whether or not you've read the novel.<br /><br />I figured I'd watch the series on my 720P plasma in the family room (no surround sound), so I ordered the DVD version and not the Blu-Ray.  Since the wife didn't care for it, I ended up watching most of it in the basement in my somewhat small home theater room.<br /><br />I have a good surround sound setup that cost close to $3K (not bragging, a lot of real HT enthusiasts think this is entry level), a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and a 56 inch 1080P Samsung DLP TV, one of the later models that I set up according to guidelines of one of the top video gurus.  The DLP TV is pretty tough on regular DVDs with average transfers, there's often a grainy quality visible that goes beyond film grain.  I can say that Game of Thrones is probably the best DVD I've viewed on the TV.  The picture is very smooth and sharp (many DVDs have either one or the other), colors look realistic, and blacks are really black. The audio is great also, speech is clear, and when things bang and crash, you really hear it.  So, if you don't have the latest and greatest 1080P or Blu-Ray setup and are thinking of getting the DVD version, don't worry, you're still getting a top notch product.<br /><br />I can't think of much more to say.  The series itself is outstanding, and HBO has taken care of the technical details on the DVD.  Highly recommended!!
B004P95A8E|4.0|I'll admit I'm a grown(in body, if not mind) man. I love Star Wars and I love LEGO so when you both of those things together it's magic. I have a ton of sets that I've put together and I normally keep them on display together. I've recently started letting my two and a half year old play with them and I think this set is a little flimsy. It's not as solid as other sets. I understand he isn't really old enough for them, but normally LEGO has very sturdy designs. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />That being said I do like the set as it is a clean build and also includes some rare pieces. I also love all the colors you can get in the Star Wars sets. I got it on sale at a blue local big box store much cheaper than Amazon is advertising it for.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I couldn't say it better than novelist Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone):<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball sounds like it's quite possibly Bruce's best album in a quarter century, for what my opinion's worth. It's bracing and subversive and furious and sonically fearless. It's going to give voice to a generation. Certainly to an era. In that regard I'd put it shoulder to shoulder with Born to Run, Highway 61 Revisited, Exile on Main Street, London Calling, and American Idiot. Indelible. I hate hyperbole, but I've got to say I stand in awe of Bruce's ability to make music this angry and relevant and authentic at any stage of his career, never mind 40 years on. Thank God for him.\\"<br /><br />Bold, courageous, Irish battle songs, gospel rock, rock and roll, folk--this is my favorite Springsteen album.

B007B6VOG0|3.0|(alternate review title: Hey, you had a perfect album a few clicks of the mouse back. Undo! Undo!)<br /><br />Fun. is a band comprised of The Format's Nate Reuss and however many other also-rans.  I say this because the centerpiece of this band, like The Format and any band Reuss will ever be a part of, is Reuss's emotive, impassioned voice.  His vocal tone, control, and intangible qualities have no contemporary equal in any rock/indie/modern music sphere.  The catch to this, and likely what has kept him off of most people's radar, is that which makes Reuss's voice such an asset winds up also being his band's (whichever one, including current Fun.) greatest obstacle: how to incorporate his voice into the band without being overpowered by it.<br /><br />A long time follower of Reuss and his bands, I was thrilled when Some Nights (album) began to play.  The title track (intro) began like a lone-spotlight monologue delivered by an operatic Freddie Mercury, with Reuss's idiosyncratic voice channeling Mercury's own bold, passionate intonation.  They had done it, I thought: they're letting Reuss free, free to fill our aural space, like unbridled air throttled forth from a giant cathedral organ's pipes, resonant within the congregation in both margin and magnitude, with both joy and sin.<br /><br />\\"Some Nights\\" itself has a lively, fusion vibe that once rolling struck me as though it was a long-lost track from Paul Simon's epic album, Graceland- its hand-clap percussion married to eighties synth punctuation, the gospel-soaked ascending chorus, and Graceland's lyrical message of soul-searching loss, hope, and redemption.  \\"Some Nights\\" was perfect from the start- a continuation of Mercury's rock-opera intro merging with Simon's fusion funk.  I was in heaven...<br /><br />... until THIS exact point in \\"Some Nights\\": three minutes, eleven seconds.<br /><br />[Whiskey... tango... foxtrot.  No, no please no.  Was that... was that auto-tuned? Oh-god-it's-back.  Oh no, no.  Don't make eye-contact... maybe it'll go away.]<br /><br />With all the smoothness of a fart in church, a belting Reuss is auto-tuned for what should otherwise be a lean-back-and-wail, free-as-a-bird note of liberating redemption.  How, with \\"Some Nights Intro\\" intentionally ENDING with an audibly-heaving (human and unrefined) Reuss, HOW can this be heard as anything but a calculated and icy constriction of a booming vocalist's natural warmth?  In this instance, it's the keystone and back-bridging apex of the entire song.<br /><br />[Of all singers to do this to...<br /><br />Listen to The Format's songs (1) \\"Faith in Fast Cars (demo)\\" and (2) \\"Matches (acoustic)\\".  Listen to Reuss sing the word \\"floor\\" at 1:25 of \\"Matches\\"... that crackle, that waivering, that imperfection-auto-tune-would've-otherwise-\\"corrected\\" is called inflection, and is a critical component of each tone a singer produces.  To neutralize it is to mechanize it, thereby dehumanizing it and, ultimately, devaluing it.  In short, a machine don't know soul.]<br /><br />\\"We Are Young\\" is entirely forgettable.<br /><br />\\"It Gets Better\\" is a decent take on 80's \\"Future's So Bright\\" optimism.  However, Gil Mantera's Party Dream (a band worth checking out) did it first (as first as a rehashing gets), and did it much better.<br /><br />\\"One Foot\\" is tolerable.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You know what?  I can't do this anymore.  You lost me at the auto-tune, Reuss.<br /><br />In that line of thinking (and agreeing with others here), I wonder if what Reuss meant with Some Nights is that some nights he feels like pursuing his art... but most nights he frets over paying the bills.  Perhaps the auto-tune is intentionally placed at what should be the first heartfelt hingepoint of the album, a sort of hollow-souled scarecrow keeping away the descending vultures and vermin intent on picking apart Reuss's garden of suck.  An unavoidable none-shall-pass doorman delivering a message of hollow absenteeism, of outsourced capitalism.  Hey I understand: some people strip, others wait tables.  Still others completely sell out and wind up in the most vacuously voraginous of vapid vortices:  soundtrack to a Chevrolet commercial.  Hey, you know what?  Good for you, Fun.... keep picking that low fruit.<br /><br />I'm sure there are some that love the album (\\"Yay Fun.! Yay!!!\\").  I'd imagine they're also the sort to laugh at Geico commercials, breath through their mouth, and yes, drive Chevrolets.<br /><br />I get it now.  Some nights Reuss arts his craft, but most nights his major frets are of the financial sort.  Some Nights clearly plays towards the latter of those two concerns.  The masses can have it: I'll resume paying attention whenever Reuss picks up a guitar and plays towards the former again.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|As someone who'd read the books many years ago, I was iffy about watching the series at first. After getting through the first episode, however, I was entirely all too eager to see more. This is such a great adaption of the book series, all of the characters and environments are very similar to how I had originally envisioned them. 5 stars.

B0051YKV4A|5.0|As a huge fan of the MTv Unplugged series and Alice In Chains, I was sure I would like this DVD. It turned out to be my favorite of all of them. After a 3 year layof from playing live....to come into a pressure cooker like Unplugged and deliver a Killer sho like this was really impressive. The late Layne Staley was on his game and the vocal harmonies with Jerry Cantrell were near perfect. If you are a fan of AIC and don't have this show already...you NEED this!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you are wondering if you should read this book after finishing the first two, the answer is YES!  Seriously, if you have read Hunger Games and catching Fire, you need to read this one because it will answer all of the questions you may have lingering. It is a bit slower paced than the first two, but still it is a wonderful book.  In fact, this entire series of books has been wonderful!
0393338398|4.0|I'm not a big baseball fan, but how the Oakland A's were able to beat teams with such a small payroll was very interesting.  The movie was excellent, so I decided to read the book and I was not disappointed.  They had a secret.  The good ol'boys of baseball were doing things the wrong way for 150 years and they refused to evolve.  Nerds figured out the best way to put a team together, but baseball hicks ostracized them because they couldn't handle the truth.  Moneyball is about the science of baseball, and the struggle to change the culture of an industry.  The new discoveries about baseball mixed with conflicts between colorful characters, such as Billy Beane, makes a great read.
0545425115|5.0|Well with 469,300 ratings, I doubt there is anything new that I can say about this wonderful book. I will say that it was absolutely awesome! This book has action on every single page, and it took me only one day to finish it, because every page leads into the next action packed page, and I just could not stop until it was finished. Then, of course I immediately started on the next one. I am looking forward to the movie on March 23 because from the trailors that I have seen, it is going to be a huge hit! It is so well written that it takes you off the page and into this post apocalyptic world, where you feel that you are part of the story! Read it, you won't be sorry!<br /><br />[...]

B001QB5S3G|5.0|If I remember correctly, this movie was released at a time when Liberation Theology was in its heyday.  Liberation theology espouse the notion that the uppermost Christian value was that of fighting political and economic oppression, even if this meant resorting to armed insurrection.  This movie expresses that when Roberto Deniro, playing the part of a former slave trader who has chosen to do penance as punishment for killing his brother in a jealous rage, takes up arms against a force of Portuguese soldiers who want to destroy the indigenous village where Deniro has taken up residence.  The movie also highlights very basic Christian and specifically Catholic beliefs and practices - the need for confession, the vows taken by religious orders, the importance of the Mass, the need to choose right over wrong. It is not entirely clear that the director meant to place this much emphasis on these values and beliefs, or maybe I see them more highlighted because they are mine.  In any case, the final scene is major and moving dramatic one for any practicing Catholic.  The acting is tremendous all around, particularly Deniro who expresses his dramatic skills mostly in silence and gestures.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Over the years CD albums have really become poor. Usually with one or two good tracks and the rest fillers.<br />I heard Lana Del Ray \\"Off to the races\\" online and wanted to get the CD. I generally like the quality of sound on a CD over MP3 and like to have the item physically on hand, also you get an insert which I like to read.<br />I was blown away with this CD, her voice is very unique and the tracks are 'dark' much like Portishead (without all the distortion). I have to say most of these tracks are keepers. Particular good songs to me were Born to die, Dark Paradise, Video games and Summertime Sadness. But the others are close behind.<br />I was taken back to my youth with having a CD on repeat for literally days!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Having seen the entire first series of Game of Thrones, I can say without question that I haven't been this excited by a television show since the days of 24 and The West Wing. I hold The West Wing in particular as a demonstration of how television can be the equal of any form of art, and the fact that I mention Game of Thrones in the same breath is testament to how extraordinarily good it is. Game of Thrones seems to have it all.<br /><br />Firstly, the cast has ridiculous strength in depth. Sean Bean as \\"Ned\\" Stark is powerful and dignified, characteristics shared by Michelle Fairley as his wife. Even the (comparatively) minor court characters like Littlefinger and the eunuch Varys are portrayed with great skill. However, there is no question that even within this elite group of performances, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lanister stands out. His portrayal of the \\"little Lord\\" is simply flawless, and the Emmy he won for the episode \\"Baelor\\" was entirely justified (although he could just have easily have won for his hysterically funny confession speech in the episode \\"A Golden Crown\\"). Even characters who get relatively little screen time, such as the sword master Syrio Forel and Tywin Lanister (Charles Dance), are wonderful. Nikolai Coster-Waldau as Jamie Lanister is marvelously arrogant and cool. The two young actors portraying Ned's daughers are also commendably impressive, especially Maisie WIlliams as the tomboyish Arya. On the other side of the Westeros world, the performances are also strong, although I have to admit that for me the Dothraki sequences are marginally less engaging than the Lanister / Stark parts.<br /><br />The dialogue and writing are of the highest quality, as you would imagine coming from a novel. The episodes bear repeated viewings to pick up on all the marvelous use of language (Tyrion in particular).<br /><br />Visually, Game of Thrones is amazing. It's clear that HBO spent something like the entire budget of a small country on this, and itshows. Spending massive amounts of money on a TV show usually means one of two things. One is that the company is trying to cover up the fact that the show isn't very good. The other is that they have incredible confidence in the show and want to bring out everything that is there. Game of Thrones is most definitely in the latter category.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to single out \\"best bits\\"of the first season (with the exception of the aforementioned confession of Tyrion, which is comic gold). But the 9th episode, \\"Baelor\\", is nothing short of astonishing, and is the only thing I have seen that approaches the nearly-untouchable standard of the greatest hour of television ever broadcast, namely The West Wing's \\"Two Cathedrals\\". When you are through with \\"Baelor\\", you will know without hesitation exactly why Peter Dinklage won the emmy. But it's not just him. The entire episode is stunning from the first minute to the last and doesn't put a foot wrong.<br /><br />If - and it's quite a big if - Game of Thrones can continue in this vein, we could be in for something really quite incredible.
0385534639|4.0|Sigh. A few wonderful things about the book:<br />It is a wonderfully told tale in the magical realism genre.<br />It makes me happy looking at it. It made me happy reading it. It makes me happy discussing it.<br /><br />A lot of people don't know the difference between fantasy and magical realism... one enters a different world, and the other brings the impossible into our world.<br />The Night Circus is the latter.<br />It is also historical fiction (broadly). It is also a love story.<br /><br />Those who know me know that I love fantasy and magical realism.<br />I am more hesitant with historical fiction and love stories because they are often written without complexity or grace.<br /><br />This is not the type of historical fiction that draws on real life historical events (which is why it's \\"broadly\\" in the genre), but it occurs in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Morgenstern interweaves the characters, the story, the planning of the circus, the drama, the anger, the love, etc., effortlessly to a final conclusion.<br /><br />The book is fun, interesting, and impressive. Many authors attempt to interweave timeframes and perspectives and fail or do so clumsily. Morgenstern was not clumsy and she certainly did not fail. In fact, I think in a lot of ways, she set the bar for this type of weaving.<br /><br />It is only not a 5-star to me because the ending seemed a little bit of a let down after the effort that went into the rest of the book -- almost as if she became tired and just finished it a bit in a rush. All in all, still, completely entertaining, enjoyable, and highly recommended.  Four and a half stars.
B000L212HC|5.0|The Prestige (2006)<br />Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutes<br />Directed by Christopher Nolan<br />Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie<br /><br />Christopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.<br /><br />If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).<br /><br />The whole film plays out like a magic trick.<br /><br />The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.<br /><br />The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.<br /><br />Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.<br /><br />In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.<br /><br />I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.<br /><br />Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.uccess and each has a deep desire to outdo the other.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well done. This is like a cross between Orwell's 1984, Plato's Allegory of the Cave meets a post apocolyptic world. That might not have made sense, but this is a good read. I found the pace to be a bit slow, but exciting at the same time. There were no dull moments in this story.<br /><br />I rented this book through the Amazon Kindle Library and unfortunately for the author, didn't pay a dime for it. This is a long book however and I would have gladly paid the 5 bucks for it otherwise. There is a lot of politics, some mystery and some real thought on the survival of the human race through extremist action. Normally I would vote for more action, but the small amount involved in this book was just enough as to not distract from the true intentions of the plot. I absolutely reccommend this one.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am a 49 year old father of two, and I read a great deal.  My youngest daughter (age 13) began talking about \\"The Hunger Games\\" and was looking to begin the series.  I read some of the blurbs and reviews, and became concerned that it would be too graphic.  Mind you, I am not the most conservative parent on the block, but neither am I the most liberal.  So I decided to read these books for myself.  I am not sure who wouldn't want to read these novels.  They are extremely well crafted, and very poignant about the atrocities of war.  I am letting my daughter read these novels.  They are true works of literature, and are destined to be classic literature for all ages, except children.
B005VTS4EY|2.0|It would not install. i have no idea why. should be designed to work on any android phone. My opinion, not yours. Annoying waste of a faod.

1451683405|5.0|In his usual terse and lucid manner, Sam Harris has compiled his case against the existence of free will in this short but brilliant book.  Being the yardstick of intellectual honesty in my opinion, I always look forward to read or hear what Sam Harris has to say on any subject.  The topic of free will is of special interest as I have always taken it for granted and believed that I was in possession of it.<br /><br />Upon understanding that human beings do not have free will, one would expect to adopt a fatalistic viewpoint.  Instead however, the knowledge as delivered in this book conveys a sense of freedom -- we can only be who are, moment to moment - and there is no need to be stuck in the past or over anticipate the future.  It also teaches compassion and humility - compassion for oneself and others, and humility in the face of our personal achievements.<br /><br />A full comprehension of what Mr. Harris tries to convey would only make the reader a better person after turning the last page -- and I couldn't think of a better reason than that to read a book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great way to challenge your mind.  Can play a quick game if you do not have a lot of time. highly recommended

B007H51DQG|1.0|The writing is getting worse and worse. I want the zombies to eat them all alive, slowly, so they suffer! I mean really, really suffer. The writers have created very unlikable characters. The plot is slow and dumb. The kid is almost killed by a zombie who 2 minutes before couldn't pull out of the mud? Rick and Lori have no idea where their stupid little kid had wandered to? WTF?  Stupid show, waste of my time. Disappointed with something that started out fresh and promising.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I was very thoroughly impressed with this series. It was so close to the books, which to me is extremely important. It is done well and done right, with a great cast and crew. The quality is superb with wonderfully gritty and realistic scenes and scenery.<br /><br />There seem to be a lot of 1 star reviews regarding the graphic nature of this show. I am honestly unsure of what they were expecting, as the books themselves contain the same content. If you are uncomfortable seeing the nude human body, or a few decapitations, then maybe this is not the show (or book series?) for you.
