B00A757EFW|3.0|It is ok, not as much fun as temple run, I deleted it because I really only want games that I will play
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I thought it was a great show and they did a great job with the actor for young k lots of  excitement
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Another Temple Run but so much more intense!  The monkey is huge and you better not slip up because he is faster!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I enjoyed it you would have trouble with the last movie if you didnt watch this one lots of suspense and suprisies
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I play this album almost everyday.  Brings back all the feelings I felt while watching the movie.  The songs reflect the artists feelings beautifully.  Love it.
0205313426|5.0|This is a great book. You can finish it within an hour and it gives all the details about good writing and how to check for grammatical errors.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|more variety than most Christmas albums--reflecting different religions.  Love the harmony!  Great to listen to in rush hour traffic during the holidays.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you believe in the afterlife this book is a must read.  Because it is an account relayed by a physician, it makes it all the more believable and inspiring.  It is an easy read, and yet one that grabs the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go.  If you have any interest in the afterlife, I think you will enjoy this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I play a lot of hidden picture games. People's main complaint is you have to pay to play. I've been playing this game nearly daily since Christmas and haven't paid once.  You get energy after each quest and every time you level. You get diamonds every time you level. You only have to pay if you want to play for more than15-20 minutes at a time (I found that's how long it usually takes me to run out of energy). Maybe some find this aggravating but for me it's just the right amount of time to play on my breaks at work and keeps me from killing the game quickly.<br /><br />Great graphics and fun story! It's the only game I put on my Kindle Fire HD from the beginning that I'm still playing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is my favorite game on my kindle! Right now I'm saving up to get the Rio Special Carmen. She is a really pretty girl and the reason I want her so much is because she is a girl. I defiantly recommend this game for all ages. My little sister is only two and this is one of her favorite games. So yah. Buy this game it is the best. BYE!!!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great story. I had no idea what would happen next as all was making sense - but then realised I was only 50% through the story. Nothing too suspenseful though - still semi-lighthearted.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|I just notice this today after using it for a month.  I was looking at a FB posting that contains 42 pictures but I can only see 12 of them.  I went to the web and I can see all 42 pictures.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Engaging and entertaining. Rotfuss draws you in again to the travels of Kvothe, thirsting for the answer to Kvothe's role in the war and how he becomes a simple innkeeper.
B008QYT7DI|4.0|The original illustrations are the most wonderful part of this book (Kindle Edition), and essential (a good word) to its meaning.  They are captured here magnificently.  A classic in every sense, readers are cautioned that this is not really an eBook but an actual series of graphic illustrations, including the text.  Hence no TOC, index, x-ray, text-to-speech or any of the other eBook comforts, but it reflects the original work faithfully - the book didn't have text-to-speech or font-resizing either, but one star off because it IS listed as a Kindle Edition and is without those features.  And yes, Howard's translation is more \\"exact,\\" losing some of the poetic flavor of Woods' translation, but I think the meaning is not lost.  Actually, probably best read in the original French....
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I really thought this movie could have been better. Not what I expected. I really enjoyed Channing Tatum's dance moves though.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The literary hysteria comes to an end with Fifty Shades Freed, which shows us a married Ana and Christian and though they're more or less happy I found this story the weakest of the series.  A happy Christian is a rather bland Christian and considering he's the reason I stuck with this series, I was left underwhelmed.  He's still possessive and controlling but is also sickeningly romantic and dare I say sweet at times.  Married life has left him slightly neutered which caused Ana to have more of a presence in this final story.  Ana has never been a character I've liked as her inner thoughts and pet names for herself and Christian grate on my nerves with their redundant use.  I've waited for her to grow up and have more of a backbone and she finally succeeds on some level.  When Christian angers her she lets him know it and puts herself in danger when an enemy goes after them and their family, but she's still naive when it comes to sex.  After every act she and Christian have done you'd think she'd stop blushing and acting shocked!  When all is said and done though Christian still gets his way through guilt and emotional manipulation.<br /><br />Though the sexual interludes between he and Ana are still numerous and super steamy there's a sense that he's been tamed as we don't see quite as much BDSM action this time around.  A lengthy honeymoon at exotic locations full of shopping makes for a very boring middle section of the story though.  We already know he's rich so these repetitive examples are unnecessary and boring.  The only time the story got exciting was when a vengeful enemy went after the happy couple. These scenes were actually exciting and the identity of the accomplice was kept cleverly concealed.  The fallout from this brought Christian and Ana back from the brink of a surprising announcement that threw Christian for a loop.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this series and enjoyed Christian immensely until he became a married man.  I loved his rough edges and am sad those edges have now been rubbed down.  Fans of erotica will still find the sexual encounters satisfying though the edge there too has been diminished a bit.  For now, readers will have to find another series to go crazy over and I hope they'll look towards authors who have written in this genre, long before E.L. James came on the scene, where they'll be introduced to much better written stories!am sad those edges have now been rubbed down.

B009C7ZQM4|4.0|well, it does what it was gotten for, it cleans the cache. seems to work ok. only time will tell..
1451627297|4.0|There's no need to repeat the kudos and analysis of why this book is terrific.  It is terrific, and I rate it highly as a very good read.  It has an inspired beginning, a massively researched middle, and a magical ending. My criticism is that the massively researched middle is too massive.  In my opinion, the long body of the book is too long and becomes distracting; that part of the story should be much tighter and more focused on the books mission.  Having said that, I highly recommend the book as a very worthwhile read, a terrific entertainment, full of brilliant writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game 24-7 and I think that anyone even if they hate games will love it. I also love how it has a new area every month that changes slightly so you don't get bored
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|I love downloading movies in lieu of purchasing and then waiting for the DVD. Frankenweenie was one movie I didn't want to wait for so I purchased it on Instant Video.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hope more free games are like thisLove this app very fun and very hard to put down works great on my kindle fire
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book.  It kept my interest from cover to cover, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surf is a fun challenging game to play. I love to listen to music and play this game. Sometimes I will do it for hours. This game us very addicting and fun. If you have a lot of free time and patience I recommend this game to you. It takes patience to master it. I play it A LOT and I my high score is only in the 200,000s. It takes a lot of time and patience but a very, very fun and addicting game.
B004P12SSW|3.0|This movie does not live up to expectations given the high viewer ratings.  The plot is tired and predictable.  Christina needs to dial it back a notch on the wailing.  She has a great voice and should just sing.  It's fun to see Cher.  The ensemble dancing and music is very good.  This is an RDB (rent, don't buy) movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Enjoyed Hopeless  but no barn burner .just not my taste.  Surprised at the good reviews from Times!  Just kind of a nice little soap.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun for everyone. Even the 3 year old niece likes to play and watch the horse run around.Anyone who loves horses will love this game.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Couldn't really get into this third book... I felt it was somewhat confusing and choppy... it took a while to reach the climax.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Was expecting more from Mr. Sparks....just not up to par with the notebook and message in a bottle...just didn't have that \\"tear jerk\\" moment with this one.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Both Claire Danes and especially Damian Lewis well deserve the recognition they've gotten for this series. Gripping plot, well directed.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It doesn't have Stallone in it.  Need I say more? ;) It's quite entertaining and worth checking out.  Watch it!
030758836X|4.0|What is behind the door? The lady or the tiger? It is like that at the end....I liked it. See if you do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome i love love love it this is awesome<br /> the world tour one you can go to new York and Rio and other places
B003L77GRY|5.0|How do you rate Dexter.  When you have a show that has you rooting for a serial killer, the writers  and actors are doing something right.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is the best Minecraft game of all!!!!!!!!!!<br />  It has such good graphics and you can build amazing<br />  houses!!!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very simply but beautifully written--with great empathic and descriptive power.  Good for any age, I'm 64.  I recommended it to a professor of ESL because it is well written,  accessible and contemporary.  Short enough for inexperienced or reluctant readers and written so as to engage the intellect and imagination.  The language is simple but the book is not simple, the characters and situations are complex,  there is food for thought and in depth discussions.  Schools, institutions, people,...  all mouth platitudes about accepting difference, this book, like all good literature,  puts the reader right into the center of this discussion to live both sides of the issue.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks.  I never saw the twist at the end with Jo.  Great read!  I highly recommend this book.
B0067TGSOK|3.0|Just Ok - You can live without this book. Nothing to write home about.  A few good ideas but mostly easily found on the internet with a little research.  Author does live an interesting life but that doesnt mean the lifestyle would be right for you.  Three stars and no more.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is great!! graphics are good and they have added a story which was missing from the first game. both are great though but this one is more polished. Great effort!! it pays off!!
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Very entertaining and informative.  I feel as though I knew the man now.  I intend to read more books about this brilliant man.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I never did get this to work. It appeared to rate pretty good, but didn't work for me. Then again, it was free.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome game the best part is the world tours I hope they go to Florida or Egypt next.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|this album has gotten a lot of bashing and for some very good reasons.<br />-weak demoish sounding production<br />-weak vocals<br />-and some would say weak song writing.<br /><br />for the first point yes the production on this album isn't top knotch but this album IS NOT brick-walled or compressed it's very dynamic, in fact it comes with an option to either rip it from the cd with the dynamic version or dl a compressed loud version from the internet, something i wish more record companies would do.<br /><br />the second point is pretty true.  For a musical genius like steve harris i would've expected him to have worked with a better vocalist.  There are times i honestly cringe when listening to this album his singing is honestly horrid a portion of the time.  On most occasions though he is an average rock singer that just gets the job done, but leaves much to be desired<br /><br />For the plus sides i do find the music on this album to be pretty good at times.  There's nothing ground breaking or revolutionary here but the songwriting is good for some old school rock.  Others have said it's weak and even terrible, but having walked into this with an open mind and knowing it's not maiden i did fairly enjoy it.  Fear not this is no lulu<br /><br />now as a bassist i love steve harris and love the fact that the bass is audible on the album, and that there are some cool bass licks on it as well<br /><br />i honestly would recommend this album to anyone who likes some nice rock music.  This isn't a required listen by any means at all but it is enjoyable to say the least.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. My favorite all-time romance movie is &#34;An Affair to Remember&#34; and this one is right up there with it. You have to watch it at least twice in order to get the &#34;time-line&#34;. But after you watch it once, you want to watch it again. Perfect! And Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have always had such a good onscreen connection. Perfect choice for the parts! If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely have to run out and rent it, or better yet, buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's boring!!don't bother with it!!!!!!<br />I've never read such a bad book!!!!!!!:(  (in my life) it was the worst book ever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game ever! I recommend this to everybody, everyone. I personally like this game more temple run.
1451695195|5.0|The good doctor had a very interesting experience made more interesting because of his medical background.  good read; inspiring<br />.
0385341008|5.0|This was a delightul book that ontained both humor and pathois. The characters were so well defined and the Island was so well described you felt you were there.She wrote in such a refeshing way . I'm so sorry she did not live to see her book published, but she left a rich gift for readers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Sufers is a great game.It's just like temple run, execept in my opinin its much better.Its a must have!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Cool little App with a lot of cool extras. I'm even considering buying the pro version due to all the cool stuff on the free version. enough said.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. A fully interactive game. My daughter loves it too. Graphics are great. competitions are fairly easy and fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is the best. I play and run all I want and I challenge my friends and get cool stuff. This is the best if you are looking for a distraction
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoy very much. Look forward to next episode.  I have become addicted to story line. Love the cast of characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love these at Dave n busters and this one is great too. I will add you may want to pay to boost your coin count and 50 are $3.99 and 300/4.99 but I got 750/9.99. Makes starting easier and less frustrating.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This would be fun for children, but I'm not particularly entertained.  Maybe if I invested more time to figure out shortcuts, I'd like it better.  I would rather play angry birds.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|So far so good.  Plays fine on my kindle fire.  I have no issues with the game so far. I like the auto reshuffle and the pause features.  Can return to saved game where I left off.  Glad I ignored the &#34;bad&#34; reviews and got this free game.  I am enjoying it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Given that I have CDs of both the Original London & Broadway Cast recordings, I must admit I was a bit spoiled and expecting a lot out of this album.  I was especially cynical given that they were using actors instead of professional singers in this motion picture.  Thankfully, the lead characters do a respectable job with the music.<br /><br />It's hard not to compare Anne Hathaway with Patti LuPone as Fantine, but Hathaway does a surpringly good job on &#34;I Dreamed a Dream.&#34;  Although a bit melodramatic, she does emote very well the passion and pathos of a dying woman pleading for her child.<br /><br />It's also hard not to compare Hugh Jackman with Colm Wilkinson (who in my mind will always be Jean Valjean), but he does a beautiful job with &#34;Suddenly&#34; (exclusive to the soundtrack) and especially &#34;Bring Him Home.&#34;  Sacha Baron Cohen also does a respectable job as Landlord Thénardier on &#34;Master Of The House.&#34;<br /><br />The biggest disappointment, though, was Russell Crowe as Javert.  He lacks the fire and passion of say - Terrance Mann, who was Javert in the Broadway Cast Recording.<br /><br />In general, though, this recording is well done and recommended to add to your &#34;Les Miserables&#34; collection.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I picked this game because of the picture...I thought it looked interesting.  However I played to of and on for a day and then the next day it would just shut off and go back to the opening screen.  I have yet to figure it out.  The game I did play was fine.  The sentences that you read were in very small print and went off to soon.  Hopefully I can get it going again!
B007WULJ5G|5.0|this film contains some tough scenes. i think that it is a good movie and it has a interesting sense. if you're interested buy only this version.
B009A9BEHU|3.0|This would have been a great concert to watch, but the editing was lousy. They switch cameras every 2 seconds which is more annoying than enjoying. They have such a huge stage/light show that you can't enjoy because the view will switch to the audience or band member before you can look. Coldplay music thumbs up, enjoy the CD. The video is disappointing.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard.. Period. I was driving home from a gig when I first put the CD in (day after I saw the movie); I sat in my driveway until 2am to finish the CD I was so transfixed... I could have put it on inside my house but I didn't want to interrupt it... Amazing.. This album is going in my TOP 5 behind Dark Side of the Moon and Abby Road. This guy is a legend and is finally getting his just due!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cried, I laughed, I held my breath and I couldn't put this book down. I have recommend this to all of my friends.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave didn't get the best reviews, but I really liked the strong story line with a moral about pride and selfishness. The portrayal of the mother in both her incarnations was excellently done visually. I loved the princesses hair.

B000VHVGM8|5.0|(no spoilers)<br /><br />\\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" is one of those movies that never really caught on, oddly. Part of the<br />reason is John Cleese's popularity for Life Of Brian. And all of those outrageously funny, and<br />yes, fairly blasphemous films.  Jamie Lee Curtis also has so much competition from her own<br />countless films, like \\"Perfect\\", that her other movies also overshadow Wanda. Kevin Kline<br />has made so many popular films that a lot of people don't know this Charles Chrichton flick.<br /><br />I don't previously know some of this other great supporting staff in A Fish Called Wanda. Michael<br />Palin should have been noticed for his stutter in the movie, which is an impressive acting feat.<br />Some stutter for the camera better than others, and Palin has it down to an art.  So everyone<br />of the main characters including Palin is a criminal. Kline is  a crook, too, but he is also a<br />sadomasochistic type, with a bizzare and dangerous ego. Kline got Best Supporting Actor,<br />but he always wins some kind of an award. It's just my opinion, but the awarded actors<br />seem to be in some kind of club.  Sophie's Choice probably put Kline in that club. I thought<br />that Palin deserved something, if not just for his zany revenge on someone with a steamroller.<br /><br />Cleese plays the barrister, an English attorney. Who hates the protocol of his<br />profession, and is not thrilled with his personal life, either. The barrister(Leach) becomes<br />involved in a hilarious situation involving some jewelry that is very important in<br />the story.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have to say, I am NOT disappointed with this gorgeous mouse.  What they advertised it as, it is.  Comfortable, precise and absolutely cool as hell.<br /><br />It's hard to describe a mouse's function so let me use an example.  I used it on Hitman: Absolution's sniper challenge.  In order to get the highest possible scores you have to time your shots and be able to move from target to target rapidly within a short space of time, headshots for all and typically while they are moving.  Could never do it with my old Logitech gaming mouse.  Guess what?  This mouse made it possible.  The scroll wheel is quick and effortless, the side buttons are defaulted for control alt and shift making FPS gaming a breeze, and the transition from low to high DPI is fast.  You can even program the DPI settings to customize what speeds are comfortable for you.<br /><br />My reviews are never very long unless I have something bad to say.  At this point, there are no negatives.  I am utterly blown away with the price and the quality I got from this order.  NOT TO BE PASS THIS BY!!!  Well worth it.

0316010669|5.0|I read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell and now have finished his next book, Blink.  This book is about the first two seconds that we take to evaluate something.  \\"The first tastk of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\\"  Sometimes, it is not scientific information or rational thinking that gives us our most important information but rather it is the first two seconds, or blink, that gives us what information that we need most.  The scientific information may seem very compelling but sometimes it is our instincts that are right on.<br /><br />\\"So when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? Answering that question is the second task of Blink.\\"<br /><br />\\"The third and most important task of this book is to convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.\\"  In fact, \\"the power of knowing in that first two seconds is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few.  It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"The task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.\\"<br /><br />The book goes through various experiments such as those by the pre-eminent marriage counselor, John Gottman to show that in fifteen minutes he is able to predict which married couples will still be married years from now.<br /><br />He looks at racial and gender profiling under all sorts of conditions and examines the outcome.  He shows how \\"we're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\\"  Often, we think we are smarter than we are and it's important that we accept our ignorance more frequently.<br /><br />He tells the story of Warren Harding, considered one of the worse president of our country who was elected because of his looks and manner of speech.  We often choose people by how they look rather than the qualities they possess.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one seems to drag on while the first one kept me reading steadily. Glad to get it on the Kindle Fire though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the first Temple Run game I've ever tried- and its great!  I really like how it challenges you. Temple Run 2 is very entertaining. After the starter level, you are all on your own and you are chased by this giant monster thing. Its a very good game. I highly suggest it!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Clever plot and great acting. It's amazing to think it predated Citizens United. I guess if corporations are people we'll have to see if this could become reality someday!
B001RNO7BC|3.0|I sometimes need to buy wide shoes depending on the brand but these even at a standard sizing have a great deal of side to side play.  I bought these for work as I am often on the move, but these fell flat as hiking shoes given the range of motion they ended up having in the toe box.  They are water proof.  Would not by a again as they are not the dule purpose shoe I wanted.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Some of their finest moments are on this colourful, intricate album. The title track with its wonderful solo and shifting time patterns, The Anarchist with its vivid lyrics and the gentle, euphoric flights of The Garden. Taking elements of Test For Echo, Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows, Clockwork Angels also acknowledges the vast history of Rush and journeys into new musical territory. It is remarkable that a band can create an album as good as this so far into their career.
0765325950|4.0|Good book but  I felt the war scenes were too drawn out and the ending felt somehwat unsatisyfing and more open-ended than I would have hoped.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good read. Started kind of slow but gained momentum throughout the book. Makes you think as you read along,
B00B2V66VS|5.0|And even more addictive too! Love the caves.<br /><br />Can't believe a game this fun is free.<br /><br />Works great on kindle fire hd 7&quot;
6304416415|5.0|Years ago, before DVD's, when my cousins still lived one town over, my family &#34;borrowed&#34; this movie and &#34; King Ralph&#34; on VHS. I'm pretty sure we watched them- they were good movies-- but for some reason, we never returned them. We must have simply forgotten. Regardless, for years after, my cousins (usually the eldest, who was my age) would &#34;joke&#34; with us/me during family get-to-gethers &#34;when we were gonna return King Ralph and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&#34;. Finally, after YEARS of this, I got the funny idea in my head that'd it'd be GREAT to get both VHS copies (not DVD, that would ruin the 'joke') and present both to them, wrapped, on X-mas day, when we got together for Chinese food (our annual tradition). But where would I locate VHS copies of both films, you might ask? This is where Amazon came in. Luckily, both Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and King Ralph were available via Amazon. A few days later, I had the tapes. I wrapped them up together, and presented them as a gift for the cousins on Xmas day. Included was a card stating &#34;Sorry it took so long to return these. Happy holidays!&#34;
B007M45PMU|5.0|I can't get enough of this album - I listen to it constantly. The lyrics are so poetic and even with a couple instruments and a mic they captivate whoever is listening. Can't wait to catch them on tour.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I tried to download four calculator apps (two paid for, two free) and STILL don't have one<br />on my Kindle.  They were all corrupt and I was unable to download them.  Now I have to<br />go through the whole rigmarole to get two whole dollars refunded.  VERY irritating!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and exciting because every different country you go to has a limited carecter but that part challenges you
B000OVLINI|5.0|The author's narrative is colorful and suspensefull.  The story weaves through the streets of Barsalona,  crossing time and space, to present two love stories and thriller that encombases two generations.<br /><br />The author does a marvellous job holding his readers attention as he weaves his combination love story and thriller through the streets of Barcelona. His characters are very much alive and endearing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this, but I have trouble with it not opening when I go back to it later in the day...I end up having to take it off my kindle fire and having to reload it.<br />the graphics are terrific and my grandkids love it too...fun for all ages.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|I didn't really feel that this product lived up to the description.  While I think it would probably offer protection for your Kindle, I don't feel it will be very durable.  It's less costly, but I would rather pay a little more to have something that will last longer - I think the plastic would be prone to cracking after prolonged use.  I returned it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing read. Well worth your time! Colleen Hoover has written another stellar book that leaves to laughing out loud, gasping in shock and bawling your eyes out!

B009H5IS1W|5.0|Still fresh and interesting.  I am not real happy with how some of the side-stories are going, I wish American TV shows would allow characters to have normal personal lives where their loved ones actually live!

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Only because we are such Sherlock Holmes fans did we even turn on this series, mainly to make fun of it.  Now it is the most anticipated TV show each week in our house.  Wonderful, inventive, creative.  Excellent Series.
160459201X|1.0|This book isn't really what I thought it was going to be. I'm not a religious person and that's basically all this book is about. Referring to God a lot and praying and all that fun stuff. It may be a good book for some people but not for me.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I thought once Beckett and Castle were a couple, the series would just die, so many do; but instead it has breathed new life into the series.  One of the best seasons ever!

B004FP1WX0|5.0|I was so touched by the film maker in this movie. I thought by the premise of the movie he was going to be an idiot, but it was the opposite. I was so touched at the end how kind he is to the woman who was lying to him.  A must see!

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Great fast read. I really enjoy these books. I would recommend them to any friend who likes to read a good book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What's not to love about the season 3 disks? The best part is that I got to finish watching the whole season before it airs in the US. The characters in Downton are wonderful to get to know better. I won't leave any spoilers but be prepared to be very happy at some times and very sad at others. The added material included information about the time period and the gorgeous costumes and a bit about Shirley Maclaine joining the cast. If you are a Downton fan, you will love these disks. If you are not , go watch season 1! You will be quickly drawn into their world.<br />Now comes the long wait for season 4. :-(
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1IYZJ9DPI7I7]]I have done a video review of three of these Belkin Cases being tried on three different tablets.

If you have any questions I did not answer in the video,  feel free to ask me in the comment section below.
B00000IREA|5.0|Bought just to see it again. It's been awhile. It's an old movie one of the first for Jane Fonda. Good old movie not great.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|As a history buff, I was excited to start this book due to the fact that it was set in the Stalin/post-Stalin Soviet Union. Combine the elements of fear surrounding the governing force and add in a murder story, and you are left with a brilliant and exciting story. Smith keeps the reader turning the pages as they hope the protagonist can catch the murderer before the government catches him. It is an exciting read with unexpected turn of events keeping the suspense and the intensity of the story going. I am definitely going to continue the trilogy.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I have to give the author credit: the story sucked me in and I had to finish it just to find out how it ended. Alas, there are many problems with this novel, including:<br /><br />1. The main character, to be blunt, is an idiot. There is no way such a person could be in covert operations for the CIA. It was clear as could be what her husband was doing, and it took forever for the main character to do basic research that anyone with any intelligence would have immediately done.<br /><br />2. On a related note, this novel is WAY TOO LONG. I dillgently read the first half of the book, but sped through the 2nd half because it was becoming very tedious and predictable.<br /><br />3. All of the characters are annoying. The main character is dumb as noted earlier. Her husband is a tool and you really don't care about anyone else because they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />4. Predictable ending. About half-way through you know what's going to happen. Why continue reading then? Just to verify that yes, this book is THAT predictable.<br /><br />5. Way too much description for insignificant things. The author sometimes goes crazy with adjectives and it adds nothing to the book.<br /><br />Overall this novel is pretty bad. If you want some mindless entertainment, I suppose it might be worth reading, but only if you're in dire need of a way to pass the time.
B008S80P38|5.0|I...  I love this album.  I am in love.  I got it in the mail and we were instantly together forever.  Our love has spanned across the stars.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly addictive. It's a straight forward game that is fun. The makers of the game have allowed several updates to the game, keeping it fresh.
B006UG90RM|5.0|My initial impression was was this is pretty decent, but the more I listened to it the more and more I began to appreciate a lot more of the subtle nuances of Eddie's playing. Every song on here is a new Van Halen that doesn't lose it's roots to the early and great years of Van Halen. There is no mistake, this is a hard rock album with hard driving drums of Alex and searing guitar of Eddie and explosive vocals of Roth.<br /><br />This is defiantly one of their best and that's the reason it's gone platinum.
B00422LESO|5.0|This is a super  good and cute read. Loved every minute of it. l love Shannon Hale, too.<br />Greattt. Bookkkk
B001EC3JME|1.0|The clip is way way way too tight. It has a small piece of plastic preventing it from slipping off your belt and the tension is way way way too tight, its a battle just to get the thing on. and where the flashlight goes, again, way way too tight! what a P I T A!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun but no breeding. That would make everything better<br />Over all it is a good game but it takes a while to load
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is super super awesome! The graphics are the best. I would recommend this game to everyone who loves loves  loves horses.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This was a haunting but well written novel that spared nothing in bringing me into the dark side of North Korea's work camps.  I had no idea these camps continued to exist and after reading this novel I read 4 other books on the topic of the human rights violations and the ideology of Kim il-sung, Kim il-Jong and now the new leader of North Korea.  The difficulty of escaped North Koreans who are trying to make sense of a world which has been falsely portrayed to them by their leaders is heartbreaking.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book is the most practical helpful book on minimalism that I have read. Many books on the subject seem to only state the obvious.  This book speaks from a deep experiential level that can only be derived from a life spent by some one walking their talk.  If you are interested in minimalism this book should be on your reading list.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|The plot is maddeningly bad. The camera moves too much during the dance scenes. And yet? We love it and will come back every time.<br /><br />You knew what you were getting into.<br /><br />Shut up and enjoy the dancing.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was both happy & sad.<br />I watched it twice already.  Richard Gere is great.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an excellent app. great for kids. getting diamonds is the only hard part. but I think most apps are like that!!
B000I2J6K0|2.0|I LOVE workout videos and because of them I got in the best shape of my life without a gym... Well now im pregnant... You can still do so much, but have to be safe about it thats why im still buying videos, but pregnancy ones & walking daily. I did not enjoy this at all, it was so QUICK and stressfull. The exercises are what they should be, but i would not get this one. Trust me when i say get Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout. Different things work for different people because everyones brain and body are different, this is just not for me. Good luck to all you pregnant ladies :)
B00005JMAH|5.0|I bought this disc set from Amazon several years ago, and the case and discs are still holding up very well... even after several moves and probably a hundred plays.  I didn't think the Harry Potter movies were going to be put into moratorium, so I'm very happy that I bought the series as soon as each DVD came out.  The special features are so much fun, and I tend to spend more time on those than the near-3 hour long movie!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Has to be better than nothing which is what I had before in my portable kit . Careful with the blades though as the small form factor puts them very close .
B00003CXD0|5.0|LOVE this movie!  Dustin Hoffman in drag, learning what life is like for the other side.  Bill Murray as his supportive and wacky roommate/friend.  And so many other great actors helped make this movie a top favorite that stands the test of time.
B009RH973I|5.0|I love this case. It snaps on, protects the screen when I'm not using it, and is not bulky. It's exactly what I was looking for.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's long and light weight. Easy for transport. Would recommend. That's all you 're going to get since it's only a cable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to say since I can find nothing on television I care to watch, I usually watch on the Turner Classic Movie channel.  Then I fount Downton Abbey.  Wonderful, entertaining, great acting.  I absolutely have enjoyed following series.  If you want to be entertained with class, yet down to earth, watch this.  Awesome show.
B00005NKK8|5.0|The music to me, was an integral part of the movie.  It set the scenes throughout the movie. Not only was the acting excellent, but the choice of music selections was also great.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|To believe the events were purely luck or coincidence is impossible. In this case three men, two pilots from WW2, and the author, had their eyes opened to a higher power through their commitment to honor, mercy, and grace in the midst of sacrifice and tradgedy that were woven into national loyalties, love of family, and friendship tested in battle. That they were reuited, much less that they survived the war, and went on to discover the parallel experiences they shared, and that long after those events, a young author would learn a lesson about the similarity of the souls of men who were trapped in a world war that pitted them against eachother but held strong to their higher calling, is simply amazing. I'm glad I didn't miss it.<br /><br />D. Rowe<br />USAF
B0094LY88G|4.0|Brad Pitt over acts almost everything. In my opinion, however, this is his best role since Seven. Looking forward to WWZ.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I will start by saying that I am quite skinny and fit (5'11&#34; tall, 135lb before pregnancy). I loved to work out before I got pregnant and was looking for a fun, dynamic workout routine that would be safe during pregnancy. I would like to stress that I really wanted to find an active workout, so I stayed away from yoga. I tried these:<br />- Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix<br />- The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol.1<br />- 10 minute solution: prenatal pilates (2007)<br /><br />Of these three, Erin O'Brien's is by far my favourite. I got this DVD in my 12th week of pregnancy because I wanted to do exercises that were safe for my baby. Here are the major points that I like about this DVD:<br /><br />1) A variety of exercises keeps the whole body tuned. While the DVD is only 40 minutes long, it covers everything. The first part is cardio - not too intense, just enough to warm up and get the heart beating a bit faster. Then there are some stretches that feel really good. Then there are various leg, body, and arm exercises - a lot of squats, a few pushups, back and belly exercises. Next section is on the floor - some more leg and butt exercises and back exercises. Finally, the last section is stretch and relaxation, which is a great way to end the workout and bring the heart beat back to normal. This is in contrast to The perfect pregnancy workout, which I found unbalanced.<br /><br />2) No equipment is required. I was looking for a DVD that I can comfortably do in my living room. The whole point of Erin O'Brien's workout is that it can be done in your living room! All you need is a chair really! This is in contrast to the 10 minute solution: prenatal pilates, which require a few other pieces of equipment.<br /><br />3) The whole workout lasts a bit less than 40 minutes! I usually do it in the mornings before I go to work - about 3 times a week. It's just short enough to not delay me too much in my day, but long enough to exercise every part of my body!<br /><br />The only warning that I would like to add is that I am very happy that I started doing this early on in my pregnancy (in my 12th week). I offered this DVD to my friend who was 25 weeks pregnant because she was complaining about pretty bad pain in her lower back. She said that it was too hard for her to start these exercises now, and I could see how that could be the case... So unless you have been exercising all along, this might be a tad too difficult to start in your second trimester, and you are better off going with one of the yoga workouts.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book! Really makes you think about life, and just slow down and appreciate things. I will be recommending this book to family and friends

B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second book in the trilogy of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  The book is every bit as thrilling as the first, adding more answers to the mysterious Lisbeth Salander and the intrigue that surrounds her.  In fact I have starting reading the 3rd book in the series and finding out even more.  If you like intrigue, thrillers and mysteries then you must read the entire trilogy from beginning to end.

B008RYN44U|4.0|While this album may not be as sentimental and deep as their others, it still has substance and is perfect for working out. I fell in love with the song Push and Shove. You can still hear their roots, but man does it makes you want to move! The song is over 5 minutes long and it gets better and better towards the end. You can definitely run half a mile with that song.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr Alexander's book initially talks about his love of family, especially his father whom he emulates in many ways including his choice of profession.  Further on in the book we learn that he was adopted.  The book has sub plots, such as his underlying need to resolve family of origin issues, and his current relationships with his sisters, and wife and children.  He describes his scholastic and intellectually demanding career which lays a good foundation for his claim to have died and gone to heaven.

B0000667RO|4.0|I bought this CD because I wanted some of Bryan Adams' best songs to play at my wedding. CD came very fast; I only wish that he would let his music be sold on Itunes. Frustrating! Now I have a CD that can sit in my car forever.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|In 1970, John Lee Hooker recorded the heralded \\"Hooker and Heat\\" with Canned Heat, featuring the masterful harp of Alan Wilson on the track \\"Burning Hell\\". The musicians engage in a little studio banter right before the number begins, and John Lee says fondly of Wilson \\"I don't know how the kid follow me, but he do!\\". Fast forward about three decades and John Lee re-cut the song with master harmonica man Charlie Musselwhite and \\"the kid\\" on this outing, Ben Harper on lap steel. Hooker was impressed and suggested that Charlie and Ben work together again. When Musselwhite released \\"Sanctuary\\" in 2004, Harper played on the title track and \\"Homeless Child\\", one of his own compositions. With \\"Get Up!\\", we have a full collaboration from these talented men.<br /><br />Harper handles the lead vocals on all songs, and his voice has only gotten stronger over the years. Musselwhite is a veteran working with lap steel, recording with the great Freddie Roulette as far back as 1969- the year Ben Harper was born. For his part, Harper plays the highly sought after Weissenborn lap steel. His tight band includes guitarist Jason Mazersky, drummer Jordan Richardson and bassist/keyboardist Jesse Ingalls. Harper produced the disc and all of the participants are of the highest caliber, but the best part of \\"Get Up!\\" is something that doesn't often demand attention in the Blues- the songwriting.<br /><br />These are all original Harper compositions, with co-writing credit shared with Mozersky and Ingalls on several tracks. Ben is known for his activism and interest in social causes worldwide, and his influences include world music, folk and reggae. His lyrics reflect the complex world around him, and the themes to his songs portray  a vision not often seen in Blues. The opening track \\"Don't Look Twice\\" is a witty acoustic track with only Musselwite's diatonic backing Harper's acoustic while he sings \\"It's hard when the ceiling says to the floor, I'll trade you places, I can't take it no more\\". The next track, \\"I'm In I\\"m Out And I'm Gone\\" is a lively Blues march that leads into the clap along waltz \\"We Can't End This Way\\" with engaging interplay between lap slide and harp.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Believe A Word You Say\\" is the strongest rocker on the disc with lots of musical spaces for Musselwhite's harp. \\"I Ride At Dawn\\" is one of the most poignant songs ever written for the Blues. The song deals with the sacrifices and loss involved in war.Harper dedicated this track to Nicholas P. Spehar, a Navy SEAL lost in action. \\"You Found Another Lover\\" is another acoustic track featuring only Harper and Musselwhite with a welcome familiar soul blues groove (think \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\").<br /><br />\\"Blood Side Out\\" is another rocker with Harper and Musselwhite swapping solos. The title track is the closest thing to the traditional AAB Blues format. Wildly inventive bass by Ingalls on this one, very cool lyrics:\\"I  have a right to get up when I please; don't tell me I can't break the law 'cause the law has broken me\\".<br /><br />The DVD traces the beginnings of this duo- how they first met and worked together. Harper is humbled by Musselwhite's stature in the Blues world, while Charlie sees the two as \\"kindred spirits\\". When you listen to these men talk about the making of the album, they seem not only pleased with the results, but surprised as well. Four tracks are included that are known as the machine shop sessions.<br /><br />What a great way to start the new year!

B0011TNVLY|3.0|For a movie of this type of CGI production and detail, it did not do it justice to watch it on download from Amazon. Take my word for it. Spend the extra money and purchase the Blu-Ray and enjoy this movie on your big screen 1080p 120hz refresh rate or higher, the way it was intended to be watched. I actually saw a boot-leg copy of this same movie and noticed a consirable difference in the digital download to that bad copy, but also noticed how much was missing from the download that the Blu-Ray made really stand out and really enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fantastic game! Very easy, but it does have few glitches that need to be fixed. For example when running, you Swype, and the runner does not move.That is my only complaint. Thank you for great game!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Attempted to access this folder in the hope of viewing pdf docs on my android S3 phone brand new - nothing was in the folder where the online instructions I had to search for said it would be. ended up downloading another app that worked just fine. this was useless.
B0055OGQCW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites.  I read it about once a year -- when I can no longer recognize a drawing of a boa constrictor (from the outside or inside), and &#34;Children, Watch out for the Baobabs&#34; is very good advice indeed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow no district 12 so sad but tallest prim and her mother are safe was amazed by how Gale saved them
B007712XAU|5.0|A riveting and addictive series. The acting is superb and polished. Once we starting watching we were hooked,I can't remember when I have enjoyed a show as much.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Confusing second half, with a weak rushed ending.  I realized the killers deserved to be caught and punished, but not to be tortured.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game Friend Benbingo. Rate it five peoples. Dun rate 1. I still have to talk this is getting annoying...
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Not a fan of this type of movie. Dealing with super natural issues or themes, just couldn't get into it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is amazing its improved sooo much what sad is that there aren't many people for the game
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Good book, loved the style of the storytelling and the way it was presented. No wonder this is becoming a popular book for teachers to have their kids read in my local school district.
0670023329|2.0|Escape From Camp 14 is an interesting story, unfortunately being told by a poor writer. Blaine Hardin spent too many years as a newspaper journalist, where column space is an issue. His sentences are clipped to the point of being totally void of any color or imagination. Reading this book is like reading a 200 page police report, as dry as burned toast.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|This was a gift that a friend of mine wanted because his copy broke!!  Well, he keeping a good watch on this one!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is an awesome game. Me and my sister enjoy playing this game and we installed it 5 min ago. Its like Temple Run but it has a fun twist.
B008RTE09S|5.0|One word ... Magnificent(?)...i've seen the bootleg and beleave me it's no the same... you can heard all the sounds in the blue ray.
159413586X|3.0|great book.  I bought the entire set.  regardless of what you hear, this trilogy is not just for teens.  great
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game but I can not make a friend.make a part two of this game please !?I beg of you please? !?!?!
1594135851|5.0|bought the entire set and enjoyed reading all of them.  regardless of what people say it isn't just for teenagers
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like simple. I don't need to use square roots, cosigns, M+, M-, and MRC when I'm standing in the pet food aisle and need to figure out WHICH dog food/cat food bags or cans make the most economical sense for my budget. I just want/need a very basic Add/Subtract/Divide and Multiply function, and if the app maker wants to toss in other things, I'll just ignore them. I also don't need nor want the use of various &#34;skins&#34; to &#34;Make it your own!&#34; It's a calculator, darn it, not a shower curtain!<br /><br />The &#34;buttons&#34; on this calculator are very large and virtually impossible to hit the wrong one. The colours used on the calculator are soft and pleasing, making it exceedingly easy for the WORST eyesight to find the = button and see the total.<br /><br />Another TOTALLY AWESOME feature of this app is something I've never seen on any other real-life calculator or calculator app: when you hit &#34;5 + 3&#34; and the = sign, at the top where the total is displayed, it actually shows your added figures. Wow! That is SO cool, especially if you're a klutz, press the wrong keys and can't figure out WHY your total doesn't add up. That feature alone is worth recommending this app.<br /><br />Nicely done, Digitalchemy, LLC. Nicely, done!
1609611543|5.0|good book...reading now and learning a lot.  apparently I will have to rethink the importance of whole grains.  arrived promptly as<br />always.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I already had the Weather Channel app installed on my Samsung tablet from years ago and knew how incredible it performed on that device. However, I was a tad hesitant about was HOW well this app would  work on the much manipulated Android system of the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />My fear was needless! Downloaded it the day I received my Kindle; it had 100% of the settings that I can access through my Samsung. LOVE the live radar feature and also that Kindle allows you to set up Weather Alert Warning sounds so even when your Kindle is in Sleep Mode, the weather alert alarm sounds loud and clear!<br /><br />As a landscape architect, the WEATHER is my OFFICE! So, I have 5 different weather apps on my Samsung tablet, which is my work tablet, to have a Check & Balance System for accuracy.  Despite all the various other apps, the FIRST ONE that I check each and every time is THEE Weather Channel's.<br /><br />So feature rich, so helpful, so professional. Love that you can choose any city on the planet to find the weather; love the live feeds from Twitter and Facebook, and if you're dying for a dose of &#34;cute&#34;, just flick over to the iWitness Weather, where you'll find pups, kittens, and kidlet photos galore. :)<br /><br />Without a doubt, if you need just ONE app on your tablet or Kindle, THIS should be the one!
0345803485|5.0|I bought the whole set and spent many hours enjoying them.  gripping story line and very popular at the moment
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Can't rate this any higher as I've only had it a day.  The graphics, etc. are really good.  May update review at a later date.
B00004XQ83|5.0|one of my husbands favorite movies ever.  he watches it over and over again and I don't mind.  good movie with catchy music
B00APJLFEG|4.0|A very good movie for the kids. I like children's movies. I recommend it!  Not too scary so okay for little ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A wonderful game for people who love horses and have always wanted one, but never seen one.there's even unicorns,and rare horses!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|A range of voices I have never heard before, take you to a place that is just beyond belief. Have never been disappointed in there work.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Good thing this is fiction.. .. everyone is beautiful ... LOL  But I categorize this as by the pool summer reading... fun fluff.  I enjoyed it
B0096BIENY|5.0|There music is more than you would ever expect, they just get better and better if that is possible. The best of the best.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this matching game.  Just the thing to unwind with at nightime. I also enjoy the storyline, giving some semblance to the round bof matching.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Loved this book and all the books before it. This is a great series and I can't wait to read the next book!!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|An awesome true story of courage and determination. I would recommend this movie to anyone. She sets a high standard.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Good game to pass the time away should give full versions free.  Pay for a game and when you solve it then what.
0525952926|5.0|Hard start, due to subject matter, typical outstanding , well researched historical fiction. He is a master of the craft.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey season 3 sure doesn't disappoint. The best written drama that I've ever watched. And the acting is beyond compare. I want to scream from the roof tops for everyone to watch this amazing series. I got my closest friend to watch one episode and she became hooked the same as I was. We now watch it together. I don't want to give anything away so watch for yourself and bring kleenex. The only down side is that there are only a limited amount of episodes and I have to wait patiently for the next season.
B000001ELR|5.0|there greatest album ever. simple and powerful.a must have .<br />as a few people know different covers , well the unmasked version with bruce kulick on there I have on l.p and 2 tracks are in a different order and if you look carefully on the back of the inner sleeve at the bottom it states that this version has been REMIXED . and yes it does really sound different.  so if you really want a little gem buy this version of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT and listen to a real remixed album. well worth the money to buy on lp and I am sure becoming a collectors edition. there is also on l.p a version with a casablanca label in the center of the l.p very rare aswell. but on any form this album has 9 great songs .
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This is not an action movie and is slow paced so wait until you're in an introspective mood. It reminded me of Bagger Vance. A lot of people hated it and I think it's because they miss the subtle philosophical messages. I love this movie...thought about it for days after watching it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I should have dieted on this show instead of bingeing!  This is the best television I have ever watched!  And I am so glad you have gotten the rights for the rest, how ever many years we can get!
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 shades! I loved it, and would recommend this book! Goodbye Christian Grey. Hello Gideon Cross! Absolutely hot!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I picked this up to read once the movie was out, figuring I should find out what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed reading the book and found Katniss' character interesting, but overall I'm not blown away any particular aspect.<br /><br />The story is set in some post-apocalyptic future where the Capitol rules over twelve districts. In the aftermath of a rebellion, the Capitol has established the Hunger Games, in which two teenagers from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. We are told that the games are part punishment for the districts' rebellion. They are also televised, with all inhabitants of the districts being forced to watch select parts. This is also supposed to display the power of the Capitol. I didn't quite believe this reasoning, but just accepted it and read on.<br /><br />Katniss has had a tough time after her father's death in the mines. When her mother became severely depressed, Katniss became the only source of food and goods for herself, her mother, and her younger sister. At the lottery for District Twelve, Katniss's sister is chosen to participate. Incapable of letting her sister go to a certain death, Katniss volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />The majority of the book covers the preparation for the games and then follows Katniss' exploits in the arena, a mainly wooded wilderness. With her experience as an illicit hunter in her own district, Katniss quickly becomes one of the favorites in the competition. There are plot twists and other important characters - Peeta, the other participant from District Twelve, Rue, Cato, and Cinna.<br /><br />I thought that parts of the ending were predictable, while one facet was not. I wish that some of the plot threads had been wrapped up better, but I am aware that there are two more books, so I expect that those problems will lead into the next book. I plan to see the movie and read the sequel, but I don't have any immediate need to plunge right into it. Overall - a good solid plot and protagonist, but I'm still puzzled as to why it has become so popular.all - a good solid plot and protagonist, but I'm still puzzled as to why it has become so popular.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|We purchased this CD for our daughter after she had seen the movie...she commented that she is really happy with this soundtrack.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|The soundtrack was of poor quality; I have seen this play 4 times, plus the movie that accompanies this soundtrack. I own another CD from a play and it is excellent. At least 2 of the main songs from the movie were even left off the soundtrack.
B007W8RE7K|5.0|Fear Factory fan must have!  Great collector's item and great CD.  Industrialist isn't Factory's best album but it's right up there with Mechanize!
0062238868|5.0|Just purchased his book. Am truly sorry for the loss of this great hero. Have read about this guy before and his 160 kill record in four combat tours. I hope his family find a moment of peace of mind. I will read this book keeping in mind all that he did for freedom. Bless.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The Bourne Legacy was, exciting, fast paced and great fun to watch.  Any one who liked James Bond will love this.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been wheat free for a month. I have lost 15 lbs. Within the first 12 hrs the pain of arthrits was cut in half. The book is dry but informative.  Well worth every penny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive....it is a great time passer! I think it's better than temple run and angry birds combined!!!!! If you don't ha e it you're missing out!!LITTERALLY
B005LAIH9K|5.0|I've seen most of the American Pie movies and have been entertained through them all, butI thought this was Great! Young parents can definitely relate and old friends will laugh together. Highly recommend
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I haven't watched this yet but had been eying it for years as it's one of the best movies ever made -- it's epic, musical, wonderful romance, family-friendly and the kind of quality and story rarely seen nowadays. Was delighted to finally get it over Christmas as a true classic worth owning to watch again and again. Now that I own it, I won't have to wait to see it on TV. And the price was great!
B00A1U2SVS|2.0|I was a teenager during the 70s. Led Zep, to me, had a sound and style that is acquired, like a wine you at first don't appreciate until you try it again and slowly learn of all its attributes. Initially it sounded loud, noisy, unfiltered, brash... but there is this magic within all that mess that makes you come back and listen even closer, a roughness and a raw edge that feeds the unsettled teenage heart.<br /><br />Over the years I have bought all their studio albums and absolutely love each and every one on their own accord. Most recently I have collected Robert Plant's solo work, and I love - and appreciate what it is and where it has come from I call it &#34;Rock for Adults.&#34;<br /><br />I thought this album would be an excellent way to add a live version of these songs that I have grown to love, to my collection. Its kind of ironic that I dislike &#34;Celebration Day&#34; because it has nearly every scrap of the loud, noisy, unfiltered and brash qualities boiled out of it. In fact I would call this kind of live recording sadly genericized and overly filtered to a point of being dull and lifeless. I blame this on the &#34;Boys in the Booth&#34; from a twice-removed generation that should not have their fingers on the controls. The icing on the cake is the equally bad editing. What gives? I struggled to even finish listening to the entire album, but couldn't even do that out of respect for one of the landmark genius rock groups of all time. Its out of respect for Led Zeppelin that I gave it two stars.
B004KKXMSI|4.0|The 1st one -- Jurassic Park -- is the best based on the overall plot, suspense, actors and acting and the newness of it all; the other 2 are just okay, but still, it's fun to watch dinosaurs running around chasing people and trying to eat them so I had to have the set and re-live it. Of course, it was best when I first saw it in the theater as a teenager and almost climbed into the lap of the person next to me out of fear; not quite as scary when I'm sitting in bed watching it on the big-screen in my room. ;) Glad to have the set.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really like this, because it is as close to the real dictionary as you can get.<br />Totally Awesome, Must get for yourself.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this over Black Friday because it was such a great deal on Amazon; am really enjoying watching all the Harry Potter movies back to back. I'm seeing so many details and character development and even scenes I don't remember seeing! It's great to have them all and be able to watch them whenever I want, as well as in order all at once. I don't like Harry Potter as well as Lord of the Rings or the Matrix (more adult-level fantasy/adventure), but these films are truly magical and I, like millions, have grown to love the characters and enjoy watching the story unfold. Each film is a complete adventure in and of itself but they all build on each other and give clues up until the final film. Really worth having.
B0055S348W|5.0|The Printer Share Mobile is fantastic, I use it often from work or someone house to print a document at my house.<br />Just keep your computer and printer on and you can print from anywhere.
1416972242|5.0|Great book  Hard to wait for it to arrive as i had finished City of Bones. Easy read great story line.  Can't wait to finish City Of Ashes and go on to City of Glass.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I wish the album, and I LOVE DIana Krall's artistry, had lived up to the cover.  Then again, what could? :-)
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The DVD was in perfect shape.  Loved it!  I will probably buy season 3 when it's over because I missed some of the season.
B003F5WOEC|4.0|The sound quality of the CD & MP3 suck, just so you know.  The LPs are much, much improved.  There is depth and gut rumbling bass not on the digital versions.  Soundstage is also expanded on the vinyl.  These 2 records are cut by Chris Bellman (CB in the deadwax) although he is not credited on the liner notes.  The records themselves are flat & silent but in paper sleeves.  Also included for those who care are a poster/lyrics and CD copy
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun way to pass time in waiting rooms, lunch breaks,  Like haveing to try different angles to win.  Try it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love the game minecraft but i really want the update to come i still havent got the update even though it was last week!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is back! Absolutely grabs you and won't let you let you go. Even if time travel seems like so much science fiction in your mind, this book will make your heart wish it's possible.
B005LAII80|5.0|Highly underrated movie, a must see!  i cannot believe this movie did bad at the box office because its thousands of rimes better than the last just dredd movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Tender and caring movie in which Helen Hunt is spectacular! The nudity is normal and beautiful. The story even better,
B0027MJU00|3.0|I have read Gone Girl and Sharp Objects and loved them both. This was not as moving as those. These characters were realistic and sadly dark but the pace of the book was slow and the ending obvious. Maybe I'd have liked it more if I weren't comparing it to Flynns other works. Not bad but not great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love everything about it I hope there is a season 4 in the works<br />takes you into another world love Shirley mclain
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This CD is terrific, soulful and easy to listen to front to back. Perfect to add in the mix of the first album! Every song is great!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer - John Grishham is still in good shape. The book keeps up with the best. I recommend. It will get your attention.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friend has minecraft on his Ilario and the version is 6.0 and it is way better than 5.0 otherwise it is agreat app.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|A friend recommended this book for my long trip. I devoured it because of good writing, a great mystery to be solved, and lovely descriptive writing of people and places.<br />I liked it so much I downloaded another of Kate Morton's books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So intense and exciting to play. It lags like skid at first but after a while its not too bad. It skips on and off.
B008Y72UN6|1.0|it didn't start ... I tried normal and HD version.....sorry! hope you didn't charge my account! regards chiara<br />never had problem before this! let me know
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a amazing game and I would recommend it to any ages because it is a fun addictive games and will be on your mind all the time
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I am caught up in this story. I did not find it choppy or hard to follow as other reviewers.
B001I5M9SC|4.0|the quality of images was almost perfect. i didnt like the central camera, it has a &#34;double image&#34; problem. I'd like to recommend this blu-ray to anyone who like great music
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is my &quot;go to game&quot; when I need to destress or relax. The music is appropriate for the game. Looks and plays well on my Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It was really cool, but some games are difficult. Thats okay, though :) its really fun to play . Also, i like how you have to get points  to unlock games.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie is inspiring as it tell us that, despite our perceived differences, we still have many more commonalities than we can imagine.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love to play this game, however, when I do attempt to play it force closes on me well as its very glitchy.  It lags in places.  If you don't mind the force closing or glitches then it's for you.
B000T45C6E|5.0|I will be a father in 2 days. This is the best movie for fathers.<br /><br />I would like to say big thanks to him
B00574P9EQ|5.0|As a teacher and parent, I have found the books and movies to be very funny! My own children loved them all.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|so additive and fast time killer, good while waiting to be called at the doctor's appointment. It makes me go to bed later than usual
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive.  Daily challenges keep it entertaining.  The unlimited plays can keep you occupied for hours.  Fun for all ages.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|as with some other games in this category is just a matter of perfect timing. but once you played it, it doesn't make sense to repeat it
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Frankenweenie is absolutely marvelous! This is a great piece of entertainment and art! The level of craftsmanship is unparalleled. The story and script are exciting and charming. The character designs are amazing. The voice cast was spot on. The music really amped up the suspense. And the 3d on this blu ray was awesome. Much better than the movie theater. You feel part of the world.<br /><br />I believe audiences didnt go because pf the black and white. I am so happy they stuck with their decision though. This movie is much more vibrant and energetic and beautiful to look at than most color movies such as wreck it ralph or hotel transylvania.<br /><br />If you hasnt seen this work of art- please do. You will not regret it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well addictive game, great fun and ever expanding characters and themes. Highly recommended to anyone, games can be quick or you can play it for hours
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I thought this game would be great for my 6 year old.  However, it's ridiculous to have a game aimed at small children where they can actually--and are encouraged to actually--BUY upgrades.  It's hard for a six year old to distinguish between the free upgrades bought with game points and the REAL MONEY upgrades, that are purchased with one touch of the screen.  Too hard and so she isn't allowed to play anymore.  Can't there be a LPS game WITHOUT spending more and more money?
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|If you love trials riding than you'll love trials extreme 3.<br />So if I were you I would get this game now!!!!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I found it easy to use for multiple locations and it gives enough weather detail so I can make travel plans between my home city and my second home.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Single person survives against all odds, great story.  Good reaserch into how to use whats available to make a existence.  Human race trait to survive.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|always enjoy a good jane austen for a quick, easy and wholesome read. i just wanted to rate it. done
B0086449YA|5.0|I am a big  fan of Mark Knopfler.  Great breadth of music - from acoustic to more orchestral. A great 2 cd set
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|excellent book, love the characters and its an easy and quick read. i love reading the books more the watching the movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I orginally just signed up to see if it would be something of interest to me and I was completely usely the rest of the day...lol! I love everything that this site has to offer!
B008B92U32|1.0|Add soon as I select a picture or take a picture it crashes or won't select another picture to swap with.
B006OITIQE|5.0|I bought this for my 2 daughters and words can not express how happy they were!! I can definitealy see myself buying more CD's from this group for them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are so good you will miss the characters when you are finished<br />I highly recommend the trilogy.  Love Christian Grey!
B00005O3VD|5.0|I love anything with Barbra Streisand, and this is truly one of her best.  No complaints.  The DVD is very enjoyable.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love to play this game.Its a cool game.  p.s don't waste your coins on amor and stuff because it cost coins to buy sharks after you unlock them.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|I never saw the movie when it first came out, but I have now tried to watch it at least 3 times, only to become bored and turn it off.  Such a shame.  I think it's a good story, but the movie is a disappointment.  Perhaps one of these days I'll get through the whole thing and have something better to say about it.  No complaints about the DVD.  Works fine with no problems.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This filming is absolutely brilliant with its inspiration. So many people been touched by watch it, it made me rethinking the the value of our tradition.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was just recently told about Downton Abbey from a few friends several months ago.  Since I didn't want to wait until season 3 and jump into the middle of the story line I decided to order the first 2 seasons on DVD.  I am completely addicted to this show.  The DVD's work great, and my addiction only grows :)  Thank goodness Season 3 has started.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|The Doctor looks awesome in Blu-ray! If you are a fan of the series I would highly recommend! Bow ties are cool!
0800141660|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much but, as with a couple of other movies I have purchased from Amazon, I have a bit of a problem hearing the dialogue of the movie, even after trying it on 3 different TVs/DVD players.  I recommend the movie, though for Jane Austen fans.  I just wish the sound was better.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|The Doctor looks awesome in Blu-ray! If you are a fan of the series I would highly recommend! Bow ties are cool!
B00001W9G0|5.0|I first saw this movie with my late husband on Thanksgiving the year it came out.  Very touching, and you cannot beat the combination of Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun but most days have trouble loading game and when its finally working runs slow.  Have not had any trouble with other games addedxto my kindle.
0823095223|4.0|I have been a figure painter for many years and have dabbled slightly with minor sculpting.  I have not yet tried to utilize the information in this book and apply it to a project. Looking through the chapters on techniques and processes it looks to be a very useful source.  I think this book will be a great asset to any individual who has the desire to learn sculpting. I am looking forward to appling some of the techniques in this book as soon as I finish some classes I am taking for my current job.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is a really great game-- so incredibly addictive,-- but it's so late rhythms I can barely by through a good game. I was about to beat my high score when it just stopped crashed, deleting all my scores. Please fix.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is fun but they should Gale the people less money and I hate how the stupid hover birds u have to pay for it

1478230096|4.0|It isn't the real book, it isn't the way Victor Hugo wrote it. It is just a summary of the real book. It can very well be useful to a person who doesn't want to read the book, and I was going to buy the real book, which just proves I have to read the prodect reviews. I hope this helps you.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very very good and interesting. Keeps you guessing throughout the book.  I would recommend it to all my friends. So good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! I thought Temple Run 1 was good....... but it does not have anything on Temple Run 2!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I first played this at my cousins house. Ever since than our whole family got addicted! When we got home we saved up our money, obviously we kids don't have very much money : ). I got it on my Kindle the first day we got our kindles. Minecraft got an update on the iPad but not on the Kindle!On the update there is armour, baby sheep, your can go diagonal, and so much more! AMAZON! PLEASE COME OUT WITH THE UPDATE FOR THE KINDLE FIRE!!!!!!!!! Other than that it is awesome, that's why I gave it 4 stars.
1401225756|5.0|If I were asked to sum this book up in one word, I would say that I couldn't do so and still do the book justice. The Sandman by Neil Gaiman is imaginative, ambitious, eerie, hauntingly beautiful, and everything in between.<br /><br />I know that there are many, many others who have given detailed reviews of this book, so I won't go into much more detail than I already have. Just know that the writing is as close to perfection as I have seen in a long time, and the art perfectly compliments everything in the story.<br /><br />If you have not read this book yet, do yourself a favor: buy it, set an entire afternoon aside, and read it cover-to-cover. I promise you will not be disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My gma showed me this bout 6 months ago, ever since I have been on the computer all of the time. When cooking for mom, 'studying' : ), and now I can do it at school, at my relatives houses and more, even McDonald's! I love this app! Thank you Pinterest for making this app!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Dont get this one mixed up with the Life of Pie that I originally viewed. this is the only one to read. the other was a great disappointment and a waste of money. The writer Yann Martel, is very descriptive and kept me interested right to the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes me learn how to be a horse back rider. And if the best thing in the world would be if you could have whatever you want.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Well worth reading especially if you love the musical. It gives you a great depth and insight into the story.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - just enough technical detail to keep me thinking, characters were accessable and fun. Hope the author continues to write!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 5 year old just loves this game. He plays it all the time. I downloaded it on his tablet then just had to download it on my phone as well.
B00336C3EY|5.0|Absolutely the best movie on a book in the bible ever made in my opinion. Job comes to life! I also think it is the best Coen brothers film, but I am no expert on movies. The first time I saw this, I literally was laughing out-loud in the theater. I couldn't help it. The way Job is portrayed is how I visualize the story. And I am an expert in biblical studies.
1594744769|2.0|i loved the idea of this book when I purchased it.  The beginning of the story was good - very promising, but once the plot started to take form I realized I had seen this story before.  X Men.  Once the plot was established, it seems like the author lost all creative interest and started regurgitating what seemed like a good story should consist of. I give it 2 starts instead of 1 because of the enjoyment I got out of it via the first few chapters and then on rare occasion throughout the rest of he book.  If you're looking for a solid, creepy book, read The Woman in Black by Susan Hill.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Judging by the superstar cast, nobody.  Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel.  Quirky storytelling.  Great characters.  Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i rated this cyz i wanted 3 gems thats why i rated g v g f g g g g g cf f f
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing it with friends. Its something to do when your bored I like it alot. I'm glad it came out
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game!!!!!!!it is soooo adicting and so awesome!i have had it for about four days and i absoulutely  love it! i definetly recomend this game
B005CYLSW8|5.0|It's as if Beethoven himself returned to demonstrate what he really meant with his markings.<br />The recording is also superb.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I got this for the wife. She loves HK. She thought it was fun,addictive,and hard at times. Really fun for the HK fan in your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game 24/7 because I just have to love it a lot and it also has Rio  Style
B000SXLL8O|5.0|Love this band,they are amazing. Every song they put out is amazing. I would say everyone should check them out.
B000002GF8|5.0|I used to have the LP, and I just felt to have the CD.  This is, in my opinion, The Police best album.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This one was even better then the others. The action and comedy can't be beat. I think this is my fav. one.
0142419400|4.0|Anna's father has hit it big selling his schlocky, Nicholas Sparks type books and even bigger when said schlocky books are made into even worse movies. As a result, he thinks he needs to show that he can afford the most expensive things out there, and part of that includes sending his daughter to the School of America in Paris. This means leaving her best friend, her crush who seemed on the verge of becoming more than that and her seven year old brother, Sean, all before her senior year of high school.<br /><br />Meredith, a girl across the hall, hears Anna crying through the paper thin dorm walls and invites her to her room. She ends up meeting and becoming friends with Meredith's group, which includes Josh and Rashmi, who are a couple, and Etienne St. Clair, who everyone calls St. Clair. He's also gorgeous, popular and very taken by a girl named Ellie who graduated the year before and attends college in Paris.<br /><br />Basically Anna and the French Kiss is about Anna finding her way in Paris, dealing with what happens with her friends and family while she's an ocean away and falling for a guy who's off limits even if he didn't have a girlfriend. Sometimes Anna handles these things well, other times she digs herself a hole it seems like she may not be able to climb out of.<br /><br />I liked the book, it was well written, had some smart, funny dialogue and characters that were well fleshed out and likeable. It wasn't a totally fluffy teen book, there were relationship and friendship issues and something more significant for one of the characters (I don't want to give anything away) that added some seriousness to the book. There were a couple of things that bugged me about this book. For some reason, it kept annoying me how Perkins consistently pointed out how short St. Clair was. He started out at about 5' 7\\" or so in my mind, but kept losing an inch so that, by the end of the book, I had him down to about 4' 11\\"; it started grating on my nerves. The other thingwas a big part of the book, how St. Clair was unavailable. It just didn't make sense that ***** Spoiler ***** he didn't break up with Ellie sooner. Using the fact that he didn't want to be alone was really weak. ***** End of spoiler *****<br /><br />It's not a life-changing, stick with me forever book, but I enjoyed it and have no problem recommending it. If you're looking for something that's a fast, YA chick-lit read, especially for a cold, stay indoors day or a beach read, pick up Anna and the French Kiss.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This is the best group ever. I like every song they have ever put out. This one is one of the best though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i am so attached to this game i could play it in my sleep i love it you should really get this app it is amazing
B0062LU85S|5.0|This song is amazing. We like the second version of it better,but this one is amazing too. Takes you right back to the wedding.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The sample gives you no idea for what you are in for. The story twists and turns and if you go along for the ride it is enjoyable escapism at its best.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I would say everyone should buy this album. This is one of their best.<br />It has some really great songs on it.<br />I used to not like Train but now I do.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Take care of, decorate, and compete with your horses. Very nice game for both horse and sim lovers.  Love it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The wife lives for this show. She watches it every Sunday. It is dramatic and funny at the same time. This is must see tv.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is a good game to play with your friends and family. Also when you get enough coins and you buy different characters, you get to see different techniques. Oh yeah, I'm definitely going to share Subway Surfers with different family members and friends. Thanks so much for creating this game.
0446547654|5.0|Very happy with the book. It was in amazing condition and I can't wait to start reading it. Thanks so much!
B003E35MQC|5.0|Sound quality is fantastic, cant believe this is 1969 love the blues and Ten Years After<br />is still one of my favorites.
B0079IEPHA|4.0|More romance between Rachael and Mike.  Want to see more court cases.  More of Harvey's court room drama.  I love Lewis.  I hope they never take him off the show.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a GREAT show. Watching this show, it reminded me of LOST. Like LOST, THE WALKING DEAD (Season 2) series is now part of my video library, which I can watch it at anytime. I enjoyed this show, for the record.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3. I enjoy quality programing. The saga continues. Looking forward to the next episode. Thinking of buying the next episode.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Green Arrow from my childhood years. I love this show. I can watch it over and over. Right now, I am going to watch the first episode and the next one. That is how much I love this show.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Enjoyed the film.  Wonderful cast of characters & story development.  Good feel of life in India. Interesting development of personalities & their relationships to each other.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show because how the story context of &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; is blended into the modern version in the U.S. atmosphere. Weird may be, but it worked because the actors did a fantastic job in &#34;drawing&#34; audience like me into following this show. I am an avid fan of this show. I still enjoyed watching this show to this day.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Much better than delirium, a must have. The ending is so incredible! I would recommend this book to really anyone!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love this show. The relationship between Kate Beckett and Richard Castle is what got me &#34;hooked&#34; up to this show. I am glad to have this show as part of my video library.
B0040JHL04|5.0|it is very cool shoe,Awesome comfort and toughness. I liked and I  use for running as well as other sports .I liked the product and would recommend to buy this. brooks rocks!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I have recently started watching this show (about a year ago). This is an interesting show because the relationship between FBI Agent Seely Booth & Dr. Temperance Brennan. That is how I got &#34;hooked&#34; up with this show. I really enjoyed this show very much. I have been watching the episodes, repeatedly.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|He puts you right there to where you can smell, see and hear what is going on around you. He has that unusual gift of weaving and interweaving lives without getting confusing. I already have the next book in the wings as I know I will be disappointed when this ends and I have read all he has published! I originally got this as an audiobook but found I wanted the paper so I wouldn't miss any details!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I have been watching this show on Netflix from the First Season through the Second Season. I am so &#34;hook&#34; up that I had to watch the episodes from the Third Season. I really enjoyed this show.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Similarities to the movie Traffic but a lot more aggressive.  Casting was very good and I liked the twists throughout.
031237674X|5.0|The book was very informative if one is not clear about after death and reincarnation.<br />Children tell their story about what they know of previous lives.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|Good but not great.  Seemed to move a little to fast but was entertaining.  Acting was good but not great.
B000FA675C|5.0|Originally read from a borrowed paperback, watched the movie and just had to put onto the Kindle.  Very well written,<br />interesting and good story.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Lawless was my first pic for movie in 2012, but Trouble with the Curve was a surprising close 2nd.  It is somewhat predictable but the acting by Amy Adams was superb.
B005IEH7YU|1.0|This looks like a great book but it crashes on my iPad kindle constantly. Pitty that the e version is so bad...
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I was intrigued by the title and Ewan is a great actor.  Very well done heartwarming story, I would recommend it to my mother.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Quality of the set was excellent.  I had not seen any of the first two seasons and wanted to catch up before season 3 started.  Received the set on the Friday before Sunday's season 3 episode 1.  Started watching it that evening and watched non-stop all day Saturday and finished at 6 p.m. on Sunday.<br />I will be getting Season 3 and future seasons so that I have a complete set.  The only other TV series I have and watched  more than once are the seven seasons of  The West Wing.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf did a fabulous job in this moving.  Loved the storyline, acting, casting and set.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008NA3I30|4.0|\\"Take This Waltz\\" should have been titled \\"Taken for a ride!\\".<br />I gave it 4 stars, but that was for the good parts.<br />The bad parts slowed it down, but didn't stop it, from being an entertaining couple of hours.<br /><br />The \\"Taken for a ride!\\" theme is shown in two ways, other than the obvious.<br />The loverboy who lives across the street from happily (??) married Michelle Williams works as a rickshaw runner!!<br />Yep, he takes people for rides (sic!), like a taxicab does.<br />And at one point in the movie, he does indeed take Michelle and hubby for a ride!<br /><br />The other scene which I liked was the whip ride loverboy and Michelle go on at an amusement park.<br />The camera work during that segment was really good...and even unique in a way.<br /><br />As a woman-loving old guy, I was also entertained by Michelle (and Sarah Silverman!!) going totally naked a couple of times!!<br />At my age (68), it's nice to be reminded of what women look like beneath their clothes!!<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Take This Waltz\\" isn't a bad way to spend part of an evening.<br />Don't be a chicken!!<br />Watch it!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Year after year the episode plots are very intriguing.  It was also nice to see the variety of directors for the various episodes.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The man needs to stop making movies.  He knows how to open the movie going soul, and he didn't disappoint in Lincoln.  If Daniel Day Lewis doesn't win an Oscar for Best Actor & Tommy Lee Jones doesn't win best supporting actor there's something wrong with the world.  Very moving, wonderful cast, and many of Lincoln's words were so very inspiring, even now.  There were several moments I came to tears, yet it was scenes prior to the Ford's Theater shooting Spielberg spared us from showing, that moved me the most.  It was the telegraph office scene, when Lincoln was talking to two young telegraph operators & his riding through the war dead & visiting with Ulysees S. Grant that were monumental in making this the Best Picture of 2012. Lincoln's courage really set the world in motion of abolishing slavery on a world stage.  I can only image how screwed up the world would be if Abraham Lincoln didn't grace our nation.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I have watch all the Paranormal  Movies and I thought this was another good one. The start was a little slow but overall a good weekend scary show.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love it! A lot like Super Mario Bros. Takes me back to the 90's., and NES. Now I'm begging my 3 year old for a turn!
B0042FZOFU|1.0|Many of the reviews comment on how this collection is both a DVD and Blu-ray collection, but when I ordered this from Amazon, it was a blu-ray only.  If you're looking for just the blu-ray, obviously this is the way to go.  If you want the DVD version, I'd recommend trying a different collection.
B00198X0VS|5.0|It was cheaper to purchase each MIB movie separate then it was to purchase the box set. I loves this movie. It's a classic! The HD quality is also outstanding.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Once again Muse has created bliss for the ears, mind and soul. A must have to add to your collection.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|It was cheaper to purchase each MIB movie separate then it was to purchase the box set. I loves this movie. It's a classic! The HD quality is also outstanding.
B005LAIISA|3.0|My wife & older son liked tremendously; however to me it held no interest. Triology has a tendency to wear one out.Too many of same situations.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm 12, I love this game. It gets tricky but other all than that it's pretty good. I you plan on buying this, DO IT!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I had never been a Justin Bieber fan in the past, but I happened to hear my little sister listening to a song off this album, and I asked her who it was, and I was very surprised to hear this quality of music from someone i didn't think had much musical talent. But i was indeed wrong after all. there is a very raw and emotional aspect of this album that is very magnetic and flows together in perfect harmony, If someone were to listen to this album, with no prior knowledge of knowing who the artist was. There is no doubt in my mind they would say this is great album. Congratulations Justin, and thank you for sharing your music, like this, with the world.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I've always loved this series. Especially enjoy how the characters grow and evolve through the seasons. I highly recommend the series!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|By far, one of the best books l have ever read. I literally couldn't put it down and read it in two days. I would highly recommend it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I don't know why people are saying that you have to buy the extra chapter,  if you 3-star all the levels you get it for free. It's the best game ever!!!!!!!!
B0013O123Q|5.0|this has got to be the most intense movie I have seen in (ok i am going to say it) MY LIFE! I even had to pause and take stock of my soul twice before the completion of this shocking story in reverse. Lock your doors before watching,REALLY.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I am enjoying playing this game, but I need to use hints sometimes. Nice clear graphics and a good story line. I have a way to to solve the game but I am sure it will be fun.
0891419063|5.0|I've read just about every war book and this one is truly different.  Many writers do tons of research and interviews and tell a good story, but this one almost reads like a diary of events.  Gut wrenching detail of life on the front.  The real McCoy.  After reading, I went back to my Pacific DVDs and watched them again with a better appreciation of what these marines went through.
0553801473|1.0|So I started the series after watching the first 2 seasons of the TV series and was really happy with the first 3 books and then came book 4...total crap and \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" is even worse. I can't imagine what the screenwriters are going to do for the TV series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In addition to it being free, this game is even better and funnier than the first one. I'm no expert by any means and have a tendency to run clean off cliffs. Cracks me up every time.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We laughed, We cried, We thoroughly enjoyed BRAVE.  There isn't a mother or daughter that cannot relate to the movie!  I am so sorry we listened to poor reviews and didn't see it on the theater big screen! It was my favorite Christmas present from my daughter who bought it for me to remind me of the turbulent teenage years. It's our special favorite Disney movie now.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this game will make you want to play it more and more. if your looking for a fast pacing, this is the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing read. Highly recommended! I have read this book two times and could easily read it again and again.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />Another great production. Credit to the director, writers, and whoever else is involved with the characters and rendering. Aaron Paul is stunning in this season. I don't think acting gets any better than Aaron in several of the episodes.<br /><br />The story line in this season was great. I enjoyed every episode of this season and was captivated by the final scene. Great job by everyone.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston was definitely the right choice for this character. They nailed it and so does he.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|Babe is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so cute with a good moral. Plus, it has border collies and sheep! What more do you need?
B000JMKNV0|1.0|Don't waste you money or your time. This book is not even an imagination stretch, it is a disappointment at best.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|You can't beat this Charles Dickens classic. Worth a read at Christmastime or really at any time of the year!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought these in hard back when they first came out... I bought them again for my Kindle Fire! Great books!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|My favorite Jane Austen book. What else can I say other than it's a classic and I would recommend it to all Jane Austen fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is a great one for horse lovers and I am enjoying exploring its features. try it out for all ages.
B004HD61KE|5.0|So full of suspense and divided between two or more teams working to solve the puzzle.  Never boring, ever thrilling.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Not much to comment about on a tube of thermal compound...I have in my supplies for when needed. If it's all air or runny when I do use it, I will update my comment!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. The graphics are awesome, and it looks so much better than Temple Run. There are new obstacles that I really enjoy, and the power ups look better too. I play it on my Kindle Fire all the time! I really enjoy this game, and I think you should try it.
B00B04NJI0|1.0|Sort of like porn only with poorer acting, worse cinematography and weaker scripts. The film industry seems to be in a race to the bottom and this film is an example of some of the overachievers. Are all the episodes bad? No. There's one that's kind of fun about a cartoon girl fighting off her own excrement. But most seem like film school efforts. Who needs it?
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun to play. I would recommend it to people of all ages!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great Good Wife excellent acting. I thought Julie left ER too soon. This show should not be missed. Mr Big too.
B000W00Y0O|3.0|The content is AWESOME.  Live concerts dont get any better or historic as this.  That being said, the VHS quality of this was sad and difficult to watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very much like what I am used to, so I didn't have to go through a learning curve.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This collection is wonderful. I have so many stories all in one place. Downloaded to kindle & can take it anywhere- lunch hour, traveling (obviously not while driving), and even during downtime while waiting for meetings to start. I transport myself into the world of Sherlock Holmes with ease. I cannot say enough how I love this collection!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Jane Austen`s Emma as in her other novels portrays the interweaving relationships of young people as they try and find mates. This story ends with pairs that few could imagine at the start of the tale.
0316069884|5.0|excellent book, should be required reading in our public schools so that awareness of what we are doing to ourselves and the planet would be more known.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I wasn't sure how they were going to make this a game on a tablet. They did it wonderfully! The movement is easy, the game flows just like all the early FF's. This is well worth the money!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is awesome from ridding a mine cart to slideing on ropes!!!!!!and Instead of a couple of monkeys there is one giant gorilla chasing you but they really need more characters and power ups
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This album came highly recommended to me and it didn't disappoint at all.  Best money I have spent in a long time.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|While the animation is striking, it is kind of dark material and the accents the characters have can make it hard to understand to a child.  I am not saying the movie was bad, but I think the animators focused to much on how everyone's hair looked and moved and not enough on the content.  I have said this before, but this movie couldn't hold a candlestick next to movies like Paranorman, which is a little dark, but you kind of know that by the title.  Brave is a nice little movie, but it is forgettable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best app I have ever. I love it.love it.love it.love it.love it.love it.love it. love it. love it. love it
B005LAII62|5.0|I just want to say that the Academy Award people are out of there minds for shunning Paranorman.  It is wildly entertaining and people of all ages can appreciate its quirkiness and heart.  I thought Frankenweenie had moments that were cute, but by comparison it couldn't hold up to the deep belly laughs this movie gave me.  If you are looking for a movie to buy, but you are afraid it will be watched and put on the shelf to collect dust, well that won't be Paranorman.  Not only will the kids watch it over and over, but secretly you will want to watch it over and over, too!  It brings the kid out in you!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and I love it!  I viewed it this time after reading the book American Cinema.  It gave me a totally different outlook and I enjoyed the movie even more.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Great product; great service.  I don't want to use any more words; please revise this requirement...I need four more words?
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Before renting this film for class, I'd never seen it.  Now, I love it!  Though I viewed it over 2-weeks ago, I find myself humming the tune.  Great movie!!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Listened to this at my massage therapist session...and just feel in love with it...so relaxing and soothing music for the soul..
B000SE0OYA|1.0|The Waste Toner was leaking ink and appeared to be full when I received it. To verify, I took it to a Brother Printer Repair Facility and was told that the Waste Container was in fact full and/or faulty. I purchased a new container from the repair facility and the printer is working fine now.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Poorly directed, poorly acted and pointless plot. Not much of a story line and it goes nowhere. Would recommend to no one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good book to read at the beach, not terribly complicated but enough to suspense to keep you turning the pages.
1401322786|3.0|I am a huge fan of Mitch Albom's books and so, I was very excited to get my hands on the Time Keeper.  Needless to say, I had high expectations for this one.  It was a bit strange and jumpy for the first third of the book but I managed to hold on to see how things all wrapped up in the end.  Usually, Albom's books make me cry (a happy cry)due to the overwhelming emotion and lessons learned in each book.  In this newest book however, I found myself asking where this is going and will it eventually get more interesting.  Well, sadly enough for us mega fans, this one in my opinion, didn't meet the standard I hold Albom's books to.  The end felt kind of brief and lacked emotion and that life lesson I long for and expected to leave with.  Yes, ok there is a lesson here but somehow it got pushed to the side a bit and didn't have enough impact for me.  The idea was great, but the concept got lost somehow along the way.  Too bad but I still remain I solid fan of Mitch Albom.  On to the next book!
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|If you like macro photography, this is for you, I use it to capture small insects and flowers.  If you like to play with field depth, you'll get amazing results. Try to combine it with a fast lens and you'll be amazed.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|It was the worst movie I every seen him play in I cant believe he even  did that movie Bad.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|After watching I ordered the 3rd season DVD, couldn't wait for the American season to run through to the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best television series we have ever watched! Our life stops when Downtown Abbey comes on and we are invested to a somewhat ridiculous amount in both the plot and the characters.
B000024IFB|5.0|Well I love Michael Jackson music and this another another  CD I added to my collection,  I very happy with this one.
B002MGNNFY|4.0|If you've never seen this flick,  make sure you set aside time to watch it twice.  You simply can't extract everything in one pass.  Quirky,  but plot and acting rock solid.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thought the style of writing was cumbersome because it flips back and forth between what occurred to him while in the coma and what occurred at the same time according to his family and friends.  Also, some of the medical terminology is weighty.  I think the writer gave a lot of thought to this out of body experience in which his survival is a wonder and a miracle.  I am just not sure his analysis is one that brought him to heaven and back.
0312330537|3.0|I give this book 3 stars because the first part of the book was good.  The second half of the book started to border on the ridiculous.  The main character is basically a super hero.  He can do everything, everybody loves him, he's just the most awesome person around.<br /><br />If the events in the book were in fact true as the author keeps hinting, it would be an incredible book.  However, since they are not true and he has invented most of the characters, then it just reads like the silly fantasies of a young boy.<br /><br />I bet that a lot of the five star reviews on here are because people thought that the book is true.  In fact, the person who recommended it to me raved about how incredible the story was given that most of it had happened.  Once the storyline started to get ridiculous and the main character basically became a superhero. I started researching the book and found out that the author has admitted that most of the story was simply made up.  The true parts are that he escaped from a prison in Australia and ended up in India.  That's about it.  Even the character of Prabaker is made up!  As soon as I found out the story is almost entirely fiction, I stopped reading. I have no interest in reading how awesome this author wishes he were! There is simply one word for the second half of this book: silly.<br /><br />If the author had reigned in the ego a bit and used some good editors, it would have been a good book. If the story were true as many readers believe it to be, it would have been a good book.  As it is though, I can honestly say that three stars is a gift!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a fun game!  I love playing this game! Very addicting. I can't seem to stop playing it. I highly recommend this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. It is very addictive! If you like temple run you will enjoy this game also. I particularly liked that the change the scenery periodically; having you surf subway systems around the world.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fantastic! Loved this collection! Packed full of comedy, full of fun for everyone! This was woth the money I spent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Grate game love it it is so fun when I'm bord I play it better then temple run by a hundred times.
B005RJI67I|4.0|I found this for a gift for secret Santa that my company put on for Christmas this year! It was the perfect gift, the right amount of money (because we had to stay under a certain amount) the only thing I wish was different was I was hoping it would have been in a box instead of a bag... I think the bag looks cheap.... Besides that it was a good gift and my secret Santa got a kick outta it!!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|It was a great movie loved it you need to get this movie! What are you waiting for. Just do it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got  this game and I played it 56 times and it wont let me play it. but it Is a good game.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|It was a great movie loved it you need to get this movie! What are you waiting for. Just do it.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I saw this movie in the wake of the Manti Teo news stories.  I found CATFISH to be very touching and real, bringing out feelings of compassion and empathy for all concerned.  I can see why it was a sensation at The Sundance Film Festival (practically in my backyard).  Forget everything about this being a \\"Thriller\\".  That's all misleading.  I have watched this movie twice already, because I found it that compelling.  I will be watching the MTV series.  I'm interested in the \\"Why's\\" of these deceptive online or telephone relationships.  Take my word for it, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
B0073U2F2Q|5.0|It was a great movie loved it you need to get this movie! What are you waiting for. Just do it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was the most inspirational, athough sad, book that I have ever read. The character of our service men makes me very proud of them. The most disappointing reality is how they often feel vilified by our media.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game, but like I said, it can be very addicting. You simply connect the colored dots to each other without ever intersecting the others, and all the squares on the grid must be covered in order to complete a level, and you do not have to complete it in any timed frame. However if you do like a timed challenge, this game does provide that as well. Good mind exercising game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I've highly recommend this game.  I have this not only on my kindle ,but also my iPhone.  It's a great time killer. Gameplay is easy and there is NO repetitive feel to the game.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|This movie was a letdown compared to films 1, 2 and 3. Still entertaining and worth the rent.  But I have to sa I was surprised by th I was surprised by the ending and didn't much care for i it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I missed the first performance and realized because of social engagements, I would not always be able to catch the episode when repeated on channel 44, I decided to order the DVD but will only watch the episode of the week as my daughter and I discuss the show during the week. I know I will not go ahead and she doesn't know I have the DVD!!!!
0891419063|5.0|A very realistic book, it takes all the glamour of war that you see in the movies, and make you face the gore, the horror, the cruelty of true war. Fantastic book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I enjoyed these very much.  I ahd seen some episodes and tried to fit the pieces together.  This was great to view the seasons in total.<br />However, i paid extra for these to arrive as soon as possible and they were a day late.  Any rebate, please?  Thank you for considering my request.
B000SGRONM|5.0|I've heard many of these essays before on This American Life, and I've read them other places, but they're still entertaining. I will read anything David Sedaris writes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and brother absolutely love this game. It keeps them occupied for hours...i even like it!!it is different because it is always changing and never the same... the colors are great too..they keep your attention
B000W91RUG|4.0|Product arrived within 48 hours of ordering. The first disc skipped or had &#34;damaged&#34; parts while playing on my laptop, but there's no visible damage, so I don't know if it's the disc or the computer. The other discs worked just fine. I would order from this seller again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. It takes you to different places to race. I think Subway Surfers is so cool and fun.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my Grandson-in-law and he was thrilled.  I belive he has the sequals of this series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game, it never gets old with the changing destinations of the world tour!! Great for people of all ages!!
B004GJYRKA|5.0|Awesome movie. One of the best movies I have seen in years. I'm a Bruce lee Dan and this is one of his greatest movies of all time.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A hopeful portrait of the dangers of growing up and our need for each other. You instantly care about the characters<br />but are continuously surprised at the twists and turns of their young lives. Not just for young people. We all can relate!
0817439390|3.0|This Book dissapointed me. It's about Exposure, ok. But i feel that the content is lack in every aspect, every chapter it's only &#34;An Introduction&#34;. It isn't a Bad Book, but i don't feel satisfied
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I did not like this movie that much. I like all of the actresses in this film, but the writing and pacing of the movie was sub-par.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love it , it is just perfect for what I need. I can close it up and put in my suit case and take it any where
B00APUQPX6|3.0|This series is slowly devolving into a beggar asking for money at the intersection you always pass on the way to work.  The kids loved it, but not much there for the 30+ crowd.
B006LSZECO|5.0|THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD,EACH CHAPTER HAD U GOING TO THE NEXT,I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. ON TO THE NEXT,THANK U
B003UAMWWQ|3.0|Viewing is virtually a cultural prerequisite, and laughs are to be had, but sometimes it's a bit strained. And if you're younger than perhaps 30 or 35 you may need an cultural guide who's older to act as a consultant.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game I've played in along time worth buying I would never delete this game I'm addicted now!!! I recommend that you buy this game but warning you May get.addicted
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|One of my all time Christmas movies.  I watch it every year along with a lot of others.  On my big screen it is awesome.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|So far I have had no glitches on my kindle fire and this game is so enchanting. For exercising your brain this game is perfect.
B000002OR4|5.0|Nothing to say about this except it is a great soundtrack.  If you like music like this like I do, then you need it for your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If your a fan of temple run than you will love this game it's sooper fun and a grate pas time<br />I love how there's a different theme each month it makes the game a lot more interesting<br /><br />So if you like temple run get this game
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What a great insight to the &#34;biker lifestyle&#34;. I wish I could go on a run with the whole club!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is Challenging but very addictive and fun I would suggest this game to somebody that's looking for a addictive fun game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome because you can make food for your horse, enter competitions, and you can also ride your horse or train it to get it ready for big competitions. You can buy other horses or you can even make your own profile with a nickname that way if any of your friends play too, they can find you easier instead of searching through everyone trying to find your profile because they could pass your profile when searching and not know it. Anyways, you can clean your place where you keep your horse and you can renamed the horse instead of Beauty. This game would be great for kids of all ages.
B000002LR6|4.0|Some scratches. But seems to play well. Am happy with this purchase.  Look forward to finding more bargains!  Thanks again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because every month or so there is a new version and with a new version comes new characters and boards and themes
B000660UN0|5.0|Both CD and DVD were great, the short interviews with Mr. Clapton's insights on Robert Johnson were very interesting to listen to.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I always fall in love with the larger than life characters that Hayao Miyazaki creates. The story itself and the morals make you think. Highly recommend.
4898153194|5.0|Misao and Fukimaru have an amazing relationship, one that has been lovingly captured in photographs by Misao's granddaughter.<br /><br />Some people talk about how good photography tells a story, and the story in these images is one of beauty, love, compassion and friendship. I wish that I could read Japanese, but I didn't need to; that's how moving the photos are in this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is written very well.  It moves fast, and it has any number of surprising twists.  The author provides a very original spin on an old theme.  Well done.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This is just another teen competition movie. There are some funny scenes to give it a buzz, but nothing really different from what you might have seen already. Nevertheless, it is good fun entertainment.
1451695195|3.0|As all reviews should start, I read this book as a Christian and with 37 years of working in a medical related field.  So, I'll review it first as a Christian. This NDE (near death experience) that Alexander had is indeed hard to quantify. I would never say he made it up or that he didn't somehow experience the things he writes about. But, did he go to heaven - absolutely not. For one thing, there is no accounting for the atonement of Christ on which every Christian's faith rests. Instead, he seems to imply (or perhaps I only inferred)that there is sufficient \\"love\\" to get everyone to heaven. Had Alexander not been clinically brain dead for seven days and if I had only read his out-of-body experiences I would have sworn he was on an LSD trip as the phenomena is sounds very similar. I found his \\"proof\\" in the back of the book that it was not a medical cause curious as he continually stresses that the cause of his \\"death\\" is one in a million that 90%+ die from it. Therefore, I would think that the premise of the book falls short in that he has no valid or solid conclusion about the NDE.<br /><br />From a medical standpoint, the book is very entertaining although you need a modicum of medical and scientific knowledge to understand all that he writes. One of the strongest areas of learning in the book is the value of having family sit at your bedside constantly if you are in an ICU/CCU. This is important to the patient as it is well-known that holding the patient's hand and talking to them regularly increases survival rate. It also helps prevent negative talk in front of the patient (which they hear even in coma) and screwups by the doctors and nurses.  I think his strongest statement in the book concerns scientific and medical studies, which complains about the success of placebo's healing rate at 30% because it screws up the study conclusions instead of studying the placebo effect to see if they can increase it. Good advice, but I don't know if the government will finance these kinds of study?
B001226I7Y|5.0|Live Rust is Neil Young at his very best.  The energy is contagious and palpable and the songs are classics.  Crazy Horse has always inspired his hard rocking side.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|For hard core Harry Potter fans, this is a great gift.  My teenage daughter loved it!  She quickly programmed it to work with all of our TVs in the house and gets a kick out of using it and showing her friends.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Very quick read, laugh out loud in a few places. Almost snorted diet coke out of my nose . Glad I finally read it.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|just all about religion and  extremely boring, i am so sorry that i bought it. wish I could get a refund
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and challenging. You have a few games in the beginning and you must play for points to use to unlock other games.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Brilliant game great graphics but players too expensive and quite alot of ad's, apart from that brilliant game play, its very similar to the well known game temple run brilliant game 4 stars!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A classic book that I wanted in my collection.  One of my favorite books of all times.  You gotta love the Bronte sisteers!
B000FC10MU|3.0|Immediate delivery to my Kindle.  Only problem:  The Amazon price charged when I ordered was a good bit more than the price indicated on Amazon when I shopped it.  If I thought this was something more than a mistake I'd be seriously annoyed but it's never happened before so I will assume it was a fluke.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best Temple Run ever!<br />Awesome visuals too!<br />Very fun!<br />Get this app!!!!<br />Best new app that is in the app store!
B0060AY85C|5.0|Thanks.  Immediate delivery to my Kindle.  This is no reflection of what I think of the book, rather it's a reflection of the transaction to purchase the book on Kindle.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Awesome! it has what I need so I wont get up late. Or I wont brush my teeth too long or short. And I can my own tunes or songs! I luv it because of how well and organized it goes into my life
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I love this for my son.  It is a nice story, very calming, and I followed it up with &#34;The Gruffalo Child&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is off the hook<br />Who is the creator because I think this the future. Cannot wait until the next game comes out.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|I found Portia's book amazing. I loved reading her story. What this woman lived through was unbelievable. I got a lot out of her story. I am so glad you survived Portia! You came so close to dying.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|This book further develops the characters as the search for the mortal instruments continues.  Some interesting plot twists and turns.
B009XEE0DW|1.0|I love Mylene Farmer since i was young, i'm French of origins and i was used to better quality of music from this singer, this CD is talentless, annoying and not what i remember from  the original Mylene Farmer.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The graphics are simple and the game works, but everytime I start a new game an annoying pop-up appears.  I know it's a free app, but that's a poor way to make money on it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i love the game itself but i can never get it to open! it always crashes. and if i do get it up, it freezes while i aam trying to play! other than that its fantastic
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game program is good.  Very challenging.  It has made many a plane flights and road trip enjoyable.  Thanks Ensena
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Another SciFi classic on Amazon prime. While some may find it a bit clunky and campy , if you are a real Scifi fan and keep it mind that it was made in 1956 I am sure you will see its merit. The interaction between the quasi-military crew members and sense of a ships routine (or SOP) seem right to me. I have not watched it in a long time and the version on Prime must have been cleaned up some from when I saw it last. The detail of the props and backgrounds is amazing.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|love the item finally arrived not missing or broken. It took a while to get to me after the 2 mishaps but well worth it.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|What a great movie. First time I heard of it, I thought &#34;Oh no, not another King Kong movie&#34;. But this one blew my socks off. The cinematography is simply awesome ! Its NOTHING like the old King Kong movies. Its well worth having in your library. I know its never leaving mine. A great price an brand new. Recommend it to any movie lover !
B003Z39G0O|5.0|Great tracks! Hopeful for volume 2!!  Great for all. Fans buy it!  Please release more soon!<br />Love the show?  You'll love this album!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Good light summer reading. Did enjoy the depiction of the horrors of the Soviet state laid stark against the story line.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Typical Picoult story with twists and turns that keep you engaged.  Ending not as totally expected.  Great characters as always.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Don't go in taking this movie serious, it's worth a rent as it's absolutely stupid in a good way. With some unintentionally hilarious 1 liners.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The story is interesting and easy to follow. The hint feature is easy to use and is never confusing. If you want complexity there are several options offering different skill levels. It's a great game for those long boring waits or insomniac moments.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I wish the author would write more of his experiences. It was well written and exciting, but content was even more desired due to the fact that these things really happened. Amazing!
B001H1SVO8|4.0|Recipient was happy with this -- it was asked for. Purchased movie to go along with book as a gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I originally downloaded Subway Surfers for my young son... and then my husband started playing it too! Now we have a family of surfers enjoying this game on a daily basis! We especially enjoy the tour of the world and the special regional boards and characters you can unlock with each one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton continues to be extremely addicting! I started watching after a friend recommended it to me. I have enjoyed every episode from season one to present!<br />Excellent
B00005YUNY|5.0|Both the DVD and the CD are absolutely fabulous. If you're a YES fan (or even if you're not) you'll love this!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for one of my sons.  He liked this series and requested the videos.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Great movie, but not for kids. This had more language in it than I was comfortable with for my grand kids.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for one of my sons.  He liked this series and requested the videos.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|Love Catherine Zeta-Jones, and she does a good job in this movie. Sweet story, with a pinch of culinary spice.
B00000JXVK|5.0|I have seen this video in the past and have been looking for it for years.  Happy to see it has been released on DVD.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover works great! It is very easy to install the device and this one is much more comfortable to hold as I'm reading.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Fantastic story, cleverly written with great understanding of human nature and a bit like reading 5 stories at once.  Can't wait for Part 3!
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Other than the cooling fan being a little on the higher db side, this APU works great.  My first time using an APU but easy enough to do.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Well acted, very good pairing of Lucy Liu and Johnny lee miller. The story Lines  are feel fresh - considering how many detective shows ate out there.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|Ideal para jóvenes universitarios (mi hijo desarrolla sitios web, juega online, diseña publicidad y edita videos). Buen desempeño y balance de carga de trabajo.
6305784116|5.0|Not much you can say about a DVD regarding a known movie.  This and others were bought for 5 year old boys and they are enjoying them.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is like WHERE&quot;S MY WATER but more stuff and more fun but I wish the whole game was free:/
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Not much you can say about a DVD regarding a known movie.  This and others were bought for 5 year old boys and they are enjoying them.
B002VWNID6|5.0|It's a fun twist on an old story..a little humor does a lot!  A good family (not little kids) movie!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read this because of all the talk going on about it.  The author does not seem to have a very sophisticated writing style but does tell a good story.  As everyone knows by now there is a lot of sexual/erotic scenes in the book but I don't think I would call it pornography as some people have.  It was an easy read and I did enjoy the interactions between Ana and Christian in other than sexual situations.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Rainman arrived as scheduled and I popped it into the dvd player right away.  Hadn't seen the movie for quite some time and I really enjoyed it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I can truely say I would not recommented this to anyone.  Neither my husband or I could get into this movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you look past all the sex scenes, and concentrate on the story, it is a pretty good book..  I think it could have been half as long without all the sex, but it fits in with the story line...So far I do not see it as a smut book...
B009JCL58G|5.0|What united the diverse story lines and different styles in the movie was the uniform music score. Upon hearing the album for the first time, I felt like it was a repeat of the same theme over and over. Repeated listening, however, made me realize how skillfully the composers have given the score different textures and variations. It never gets boring. A great piece of art.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its really challenging than the first on. More stuff to do than in the first temple run. Its lots of fun.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Wonderfully done, CG is great, characters are well-rounded and AWESOME on so many levels, action sequences are perfectly executed, and I love that Wolverine makes a cameo appearance XD If you love X-Men, buy this movie. IT'S EPIC!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Couldn't get into this story. First book I purchased for my Kindle.Don't know if it was the book or using the kindle that made it so difficult.
B000MV9026|5.0|I like the overall message of the movie. It's good to expose to kids! The CG was good and the characters are hilarious/adorable. I recommend this movie!
0316056863|5.0|Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoyed reading it. I will borrow it when I visit her. Love a fun book!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Still a great movie! Wonderfully executed. I never read the books (I tried but I couldn't even finish book 1...) but the movies are wicked! Acting still great. Action scenes still great. CG still great. GREATNESS! XD
B005IQZB14|5.0|what a great adventure written by a troubled woman with an inspiring and exciting story to share. As a true story, Cheryl Strayed takes you with her on the Pacific Coast Trail through trials and tribulations that will make you feel as though you are right by her side going through it with her. I highly recommend this fabulous book.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I freaking loved this movie! It's funny, fast-paced, the characters come alive instantly, the plot is great, the actors were phenomenal, and OMG Leonard Nimoy is in it too! YAY! LOVE LOVE LOVE. BUY BUY BUY!!! XD
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I returned a Corsair  M90 because of the crappy software. I saw this and read the great reviews and bought it, believe me this mouse is as good as all the rave reviews say it is. The build is as good if not better than the higher priced mice and the software is easy to install and use. I don't expect to see these at this price for very long so snag one while you can.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I mean, you really need this if you still have or just bought a PS2 like me. Nice little memory card, definitely dated because everything has enough space built into the system which simplifies life but whatever. You need it. SO BUY IT XD
B008B92U32|3.0|If you read the app's description, you will see that the developer made a great effort in marketing his app. It is sold as one of the world's wonders, but it isn't. The app is not intuitive (there goes on star). The overall experience is poor, to be honest. I tried to edit 5 pictures and after trying for 15 mins, I just closed the app (there goes the second star). Maybe the developer over exalted his app and created some expectations on me that were not met. Once I finally got one picture to be OK, I emailed it to myself, but when I looked at the edited picture in a computer, it was horrible. Don't take me wrong, I know that it is not Photoshop, but again, based on the app's description, I was expecting more from it. I think that the app may be suitable for the general public, but not for picky people, like me. Either way, for teens that just want to have some fun and don't bother on how good or bad the edited picture looks like, they will love the app.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Lots of funny jokes and situations, acting was surprisingly good, characters had great chemistry and played off each other very well, and zombies galore! I like it! XD
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now, with the Kindle app, I can lazily engage in my obsession from the sofa rather than going all the way to the computer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is totally amazing especially because it has all sorts of stuff and it even has unicorns! I love it because well I love horses and the graphics are amazing!  : )  ; )<br />you should totally get this app
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great books!! Has plenty of intigue, action, mystery, and romance.  Not one you know the ending by the middle of the book or before. Lots of suspense. Shows that looks can be deceiving and that big things can come in little packages. Definitely recommend all three books
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I personally think this a great book for kids. It's got along of everyday children's acts and when you read it you'll have some good laughs too. So the next time your looking for a good funny book Series get DIARY OF A WIMPY KID.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|By grounding the traditional Green Arrow mythology in the real world (no super powers), the CW's Arrow successfully seeks to modernize the comic giant for a new audience. Stephen Amell's multi-layered performance as the titular deeply wounded archer-for-justice is compelling, and the rest of the show’s actors have been able to create complex characters you can care about. An excellent first season of what I hope will be a long-running series.
B009DA74ES|5.0|There isn't much to say, the story is great, the actors &#34;rock&#34;, and foremost David Duchovny was born to play this part, to be Hank Moody!<br />I hope there'll be tons of more seasons coming!<br /><br />I really love to watch it, its funny, gripping, dramatic, &#34;realistic-ish&#34; and there is alcohol and sex..so what is there not to like!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and the whole Supernatural team have really brought their A-game this season. New showrunner Jeremy Carver has expanded the mythology in interesting ways. Great guest stars like Felicia Day (&#34;Charlie&#34;) and the ever-clever Misha Collins (&#34;Castiel&#34;) deepen the delight. A great 8th season for the best show on TV!
0765325950|5.0|Great end for maybe the greatest fantasy series ever. Sorry this had to end without Robert Jordan being able to see his<br />creation in its full maturity.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is great for young horse lover's.  it takes you through from grooming to feeding to competitions. I give it a thumbs up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and can't wait for the movie and kids are going to love this book and movie for sure
B0011UJMK2|1.0|I couldn't put this book down but was so disappointed with the end.  I didn't like either of the characters.
6300247120|5.0|this is a  great purchase!  i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it. I loved that it took place in the 70's and at one of my favorite colleges IU!
140123769X|5.0|Fairy tales don't always have happy endings. Sometimes they break your heart. If I weren't already gobsmacked by Willingham's storytelling this arc would've done the trick. FABLES Vol. 18: CUBS IN TOYLAND collects issues #114-123. This trade offers the \\"Cubs in Toyland\\" arc, narrated in eight chapters, as well as the two-parter \\"The Destiny Game.\\" Not included are the back-up stories featuring the winged blue monkey Bufkin.<br /><br />With one part of Ambrose's prophesy concerning the fates of the Wolf cubs already fulfilled (that of Winter's becoming the next North Wind), you wouldn't have blamed Willingham if he'd eased off some. Instead, \\"Cubs in Toyland\\" fleshes out two more stages of the prophesy. Even as Winter undergoes rigorous training as the new North Wind, Therese is consumed with her unseemly new toy, unseemly because a toyboat makes for a peculiar plaything for a girl. Therese claims that the toyboat (say \\"toyboat\\" ten times, I dare you) insists that she only play with it and no other toy, except that her mom, Snow White, scoffs at this. One early morning Therese and her toyboat - whose name is Mr. Steampuddle - go out for a walk, in search of a trickle, just a trickle, of water.<br /><br />FABLES is the gift that keeps on giving. Willingham and artists Mark Buckingham and Steve Leialoha deliver so very consistently. \\"Cubs in Toyland\\" is possibly FABLES's most gutwrenching arc. Me, my favorite characters in this series are the Wolf family, and so I was even more invested in reading this story. Willingham lends gravitas and a foreboding atmosphere from jump. Early indications suggested that another bit of Ambrose's prophesy is about to come to fruition. Therese's wandering takes her to a faraway land, to Discardia, a desolate realm awaiting its queen and where broken toys long to be made whole again. Therese hesitantly steps towards her destiny. All is not as it seems.<br /><br />In Wolf Valley, Therese's absence is soon noted, and search parties quickly dispatched. No one feels more badly than the oldest cub Darian who feels he was negligent in his safeguarding his missing sister. Off he goes on the back of a tick tock tiger on an improbable rescue mission.<br /><br />This is fabulous stuff, and harrowing stuff, and, ultimately, sorrowful stuff. Willingham has never been so good as he is here in sparking an emotional connection from the reader (or from me, anyway). In terms of further plot details, I'll briefly mention that this arc also touches on the Fables' move to Castle Dark and Mrs. Sprat's deceitful reassimilation into the Fables community. Of the central arc itself I can't rave enough. It'll keep you up late, turning pages. Willingham imbues his characters with such depth and richness and he tells a story so well and is so inventive, I can't really see FABLES losing too much momentum going forward. Here, Willingham injects themes of childish petulance and deep loss and bittersweet redemption and even a whiff of the Arthurian myth. He paints Therese's Toyland as this seriously unsettling purgatory populated by sinister mangled toys. In this arc you will believe that a creepy Teddy Ruxpin lookalike can hold his own against a raging tiger.<br /><br />\\"The Destiny Game\\" comprises the trade's last two issues and features the dark and brooding art of guest artist Gene Ha (remember him from TOP TEN?). This mini-arc tells an early tale of Bigby Wolf as he strives to thwart a horrifying destiny bestowed upon him by a mysterious woman under duress.<br /><br />As a bonus, there are five pages of black & white character designs and preliminary art from Mark Buckingham.dispatched.

B007U4DIM6|5.0|I bought this movie for my 6 year old because she is totally obsessed with the whole Beverly Hills Chihuahua franchise. She seemed to like it. :)
B000I0QL82|5.0|.. great purchase!  i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I bought this dvd when I had only very briefly seen the show on tv. It is hilarious and I am so glad I bought it. Absolutely love this show, SO many one liners! Brilliantly written!
1577312082|1.0|did not like it should return it for credit with some otger items I need to read more careful about what i am buying.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Great dvd, fast shipping. This is an awesome show and Florence Welch is a briliant genius, she really knows how to captivate an audience.
B005K15SPG|5.0|Easy to listen to, variety of songs.  Made me buy live CD.  Kids ask for it in car on a regular basis.
B000024F6I|5.0|When Dave Brubeck died, I barely knew who he was. Then I realised that familiar tune of his when the news broadcaster, Brian Williams, discussed him on the NBC Nightly News. Oh, that was &#34;Take Five.&#34; Pardon my ignorance, but I was born long after Brubeck's golden years, which is why I kind of missed out on him. That tune - however - was still well and alive even in the late 1980s when I was born and 1990s growing up, and even today.<br /><br />When I heard that tune, I thought I should pay tribute to the late great Mr. Brubeck. I bought this CD in his honour. Nearly every song on this album was memorable. Thank you, Dave Brubeck, for brightening my life up. May you rest in piece. As much as I love Kenny G, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and a handful of other great jazz musicians, it is so much better to acquaint my self another master at this genre I am only now truly beginning to fall in love. If you want to honour Brubeck, you should buy a CD too. Have physical music while you still can! Way better than an MP3, in my opinion.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is a great show to teach people about what people had to do to survive in tough times and how corrupt politics has been in the past and how it always will be in this great country of ours.
075669812X|4.0|My son loves it. He uses it quite often.  I am glad we got it for him, since he like to know more about the characters.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I read this book, as did 5 other friends, for our monthly book club.  This book was my pick and I felt guilty for that because the length of the book mostly consisted of &#34;stuffing&#34;.  We all agreed that this book could have easily been cut down to 200-300 pages and been even better.  The real story just didn't seem to appear until the last quarter of the book.  But, I did find the sarcastic tone of the writer to be humorous.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|These guy's &#34;Know how to do it!&#34; Very emotional guitar riffs that kinds scream at you. Great stuff that leaves you wanting more.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I was hooked just by the intro. waaaaay better than just a hidden object game. story lines and case solving. loved it. I was actually sad that I finished it lol
B003IWYOF4|5.0|A must have for anyone that grew up in the 80's.<br />A great movie, writer/director, and great cast.<br />Movie to be enjoyed over and over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The saga continues!  As time marches on, so does the extended family of Downton Abbey.  They<br />face all sorts of tragedies and joys as they attempt to adjust to the life in postwar Britain.  The cast<br />is excellent with continuing character developement.  In summary, a gorgeous period piece that<br />the entire family will enjoy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well now when I try to play it takes me to this. But It will be fixed I think. You should really update it so it has armor like on the I devices.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Awesome!!! I love how the further you go the more challenging it gets! I am really looking forward to #3!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Totally addicted! I play this game every morning and every night, just simple enough to get your mind off of things and have fun (:
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a really fun game and my friends love it. It is so addictive and we always play competitions the only downfall is that hoverboards cost so much and limited people. But apart from that I think it is a very good game. You should make subway surfers 2.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this unit because I wanted something really cheap. I found this for $10 more than their cheapest one and it has phantom power,pre amps and more channels than the cheaper one. as far as quality goes I would recommend this to any one wanting to use it for practice and small recording projects. it feels solid gives a good mix and really has a lot of controls for such a cheap mixer. some of the comments that I have seen talk of how light and cheap feeling this thing is and I disagree. it is heavier than it looks and it is made of a hard plastic but I keep it stationary so that is not a problem . again it is a cheap mixer but it works as well as the more expensive ones
B009FZHYKU|5.0|thanks it was a great movie. i would recommend it to any one that loves  movies. thanks you very much
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok well its stupid how it delete my multipler when i upgraded it but its a fun game lol ya thats my review

0894803123|4.0|Ordered this to go with the Cuisinart ice cream maker, and some day I may make some of the recipes (I had my own recipe that I planned to make and like it so much I haven't done anything else yet!). My only quibble with the book is that it has little in the way of less than full fat recipes.
B00013RC8O|4.0|this is a great movie for the fan of car chases and fast cars in general.  barry newman seems to be one of the best under-rated actors of the '70's and his depiction of a depressed man trying to elude cops is great!  movie came in great condition and in record time.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I love the way this album flows, with softer interludes between the harder tracks, like a music roller coaster.  Alt+J's sound is unique, kind of a style fusion of Imogen Heap and The Bravery.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|We use this to share photos between devices since we have an iPhone, iPads, Android Phone, a MacBook Pro and Windows laptop.<br /><br />Just makes it perfectly simple and lessens the headaches. Thanks!
0061906220|5.0|Samantha loves these books. We gave her 2 for Christmas.  She wants her mother to read them to her over and over.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|I love Disney movies! I went to Amazon because Netflix didn't have this on \\"Watch it Now.\\" The streaming was high quality, and there was no need to install additional software. I will order movie rentals with Amazon again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun game and its also a bit addictive! Kind of reminds me of temple run in a subway
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Great understated performances, portraying normal people in believable ways.  It was also refreshing to see conscientious religious people portrayed in the normal way they live their lives, which is not how Hollywood portrays religion typically these days.
1607066017|3.0|So, there's been a lot of buzz in the circles that I travel in about this series from Image Comics, but I just didn't get around to reading it yet. When my local comic shop announced a deal that they were going to run to get new readers in on the series where if you bought the collected edition of issues 1-6, they'd give you a free copy of issue 7, I thought I'd bite and take a chance on the series.<br /><br />Well... I'm not as blown away by the story as I thought I'd be. Part SciFi Space Opera, part Fantasy, part Romeo & Juliet love story, Saga tells the story of Marko and Alana, each from opposite warring races who have fallen in love and have even had a child (no spoilers here, the child is born on page 2 of the first issue). What is interesting is Alana's race finds their power in technology, while Marko's race finds their power in magic, so their daughter is a mixture of this science and magic. What follows is Marko and Alana on the run from their respective governments and armies, bounty hunters, and in some cases the indigenous life of the planet they are on, trying to keep their daughter alive. I'm assuming that the daughter lives, as there are parts of the story that she is narrating as she remembers events.<br /><br />Fiona Staples' artwork is excellent, and Brian K. Vaughan's writing is certainly up to his usual standards, there just wasn't a whole lot that happens in these first 6 issues, and I think what happened is that the story was just so hyped up for me prior to reading it, I think the series never had a chance to impress me all that much. I haven't read the free copy of issue 7 yet, and I'll more than likely pick up the second volume of the collected editions, as I'm curious enough to see where the cliffhanger in issue 6 takes them, but if there stands a strong chance that I may not read the series beyond that. It's not that it's a bad series, just not for me.

Normally one would be Grateful for a Free Video but Amazon give you a Cheap Standard Definition Version to Watch and on my Large Screen HDTV the Movies are Grainy and Poor Quality so I mostly Never Watch Them.<br /><br /> If Amazon really gave it some thought in appreciation to their Prime High Dollar Spending Customers they would Spare the Extra Few Cents it May Cost to Issue a High Def Version of the Movies so you can actually enjoy watching them !<br /><br /> \\" Just Give Me Something, Something I Can Use \\"<br /><br /> Hi Def Amazon Digital Video as a Gift, Instead of Standard Def Amazon Digital Video.
141659521X|5.0|I loved the way it was written and the story line was great. It is based on true facts except the situations and operations are fictional. Gives great insight into the CIA and what they are involved in. I recommend it! You cannot put it down! Great book!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Some bad stuff<br />Amazon kindle fire buy now bane is not that strong<br />The journey lies ahead and do it is good to be the neck of a bit of a new study shows the postcard and a bit more about that strong enough for the neck and do not have a new comment on the postcard from the neck of the postcard and a bit more than one of a new so buy now
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am pretty impressed that this android game is nearly better than the computer games I have.  My young daughter and I play this together.  We own two horses and she likes playing this because she translates it our horses.  Fun. Fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game that is fun and challenging.  I love racing in the mines and on the zip lines!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game. It's a fun time waster that challenges your reflexes. It's also good for competition to see who can go the furthest.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Great story and nice to hear the truth first hand.  Very technical description of missions and the bin Laden raid, clearly this guy was a first rate grade A professional (obviously).  My only complaint would be the writing style felt very forced and lacked classic storytelling mechanisms to make the book more readable.  Overall I would recommend to anyone interested in knowing how arguably the most significant special ops raid on history went down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fave app! love it! I love being able to train and care for my own horse! its so entertaining and loads of fin!
B005LAIIA8|3.0|It's not that there is anything wrong with this movie per se, we just didn't like it nearly as much as most of the other Tim Burton movies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The plot was good.  However, the profanity in the book  was overwhelming, was not needed and took away from the story. Also, a better ending was needed to the novel.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I thought it had a good story, but  she would ramble on and on and get off point, I thought, like you might say, &#34;but I digress&#34;
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Downloaded for the kids, they hated it so it was very promptly deleted...I tried it and had to agree with them.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I like the game but I would like to play as more characters. My brother is always annoying me because he wants to play as atom. l hope they will fix this issue.otherwise the game is really good. I like to play with my brothers. I think that you should have the game.
0743270754|5.0|This is a major tome but each time I pick it up, I enjoy it immensely. Very well written and highly engaging.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Here's my first thoughts, kind of a review about the movie:<br />Masterpiece, well I must say that the whole story is marvelous. Victor Hugo was a genius<br />and even when you think you know everything about it, there's always some sort of aspect you<br />discover and this is because of how deep and profound the meaning and message of this novel.<br />Back to the movie.... Overall very very good, I'm sure it'll get tons of awards, it is already getting them.<br />Obviously, as a theater geek, I prefer West End or Broadway BUT I must say I was waiting for something like<br />this to watch on the big screen, and in the couch of your living room.<br />The movie seems like a different view of it and it's very captivating.<br /><br />For sure the special effects and visual aspect of the first scenes are of very high level.<br />Hugh Jackman starts introducing us Jean Valjean on very intense way and his performance is amazing. You can tell<br />there was a work of introspection and study of the character... And you can see in his eyes the internal conflict JVJ has all the time since he's on parole.<br /><br />Montreuil-Sur-Mer was impressive, feels like you could taste how it was for people living back then. The lovely ladies scene was pretty rough, by this I mean crude. But it created the atmosphere to make \\"I dreamed a dream\\" an Oscar-winning-scene.<br /><br />Passing to Cosette and the Thénardier's... I seemed to like a lot Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen but..... in the end i felt like something was missing.<br />Master of the house could have been a bit funnier.... I guess it was just a sophisticated version of the Thénardier's.<br /><br />Suddenly, was very moving. Great job, seriously they should consider it too for the theatrical version.<br />Paris, stunning!!! Gavroche gets you so much. I loved the scene where he sings to the bourgeois man in the coach.<br />Enjorlas and the students, all awe-inspiring full of energy and motivation.<br />What can Isay about Samantha Barks, she did a great job playing WestEnd Les Mis and she did was super in the cinema as well. Very touching On My Own. (Didn't get all those changes in the order of the songs.... naaah... don't do this to us... you just can take and mix everything up)<br />Nevertheless \\"A little fall of rain\\" was hair-rising. Eddie Redmayne where have you been all this time. Great Job.<br /><br />Now let me tell you this.... General Lamarque's funeral and how they sang \\"Do you hear the people sing\\", gave me goosebumps. I really liked it.<br />One Day More, I'd rather have them all together singing in one place. But it was nice.<br /><br />What could I say about Russel Crowe, I guess we can forgive his performance in Stars taking into account all of the rest. Overall good.<br />I thought it was suggestive when he leaves his medal into Gavroche dead body.<br /><br />The battles were nice, but short. I read somewhere they shortened them, that's a shame. Well I guess that for someone who's not mad about this show, 15 minutes would be too much. Bring him home nice, and everything that followed.<br /><br />I would now like to stop at \\"Empty chairs at empty tables\\" I was expecting to see the student's ghosts....<br />The end of the movie was ok. Pretty accurate and not in a \\"rushy\\" way which is good that they took care even of the last minutes... Well you know they might have said wow it's been two and a half hours people are sitting there let's hurry up a little.<br /><br />The last scene, with the barricade and the reprise of \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" ASTONISHING!<br /><br />To conclude;<br />You might not think about it but applause at the end of each number mean a lot! Crowd gives that energy and that pause between one number and the other that I consider vital.<br />This is a great story, novel, show and movie. Nothing else can be said.<br />I def. can't wait for the DVD to be released.<br /><br />\\"Do you hear the people sing?<br />Say, do you hear the distant drums?<br />It is the future that they bring<br />When tomorrow comes... \\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting...my family and I take turns and challenge each other. Kind of  like temple run with a 21st century twist on it.even my teenagers have fun playing it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The acting is well done, the story line concise, the story is good and believable, looking forward to next show.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its cool. You score to get better things to get more points.New way to pass the time.... surf's up dude.
1416972250|5.0|City of Glass by Cassandra Clare was a very interesting book. I felt the journey through reading this book was fantastic. Cassandra takes you through a experience that is very unique. I felt this was the best out of the whole series the depth of the plot drove you into it much quicker than usually. Cassandra is very much one of my favorite authors. Remember to pick up this BOOK !!!!!!!!!!

0385537816|5.0|Reading this trilogy was like watching a movie in my mind.  I have read and re read them many times.  They actually turned me back on to reading and I have loved them ever since.  The story is told by Ana in first person but I find it to truly be about the growth of Christian.  How E.L. James unfolds his character and reveals his true character is beautiful.  There is so much more to these books than the sex...but that is really hot too. The love story is captivating and the emotional depth is so raw.  Love love love!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. I love getting new games and the challenge of completing a game. Worth getting! :)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!! Although it reminds me of temple run I'm addicted to it. I play it every day and night at home and anywhere/everywhere. The first time I played it I got 552 gold. You should totally get this game if you like games like temple run.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|This app really gave me headaches, the second day I bought it it started acting up, it would force close &amp; then all of a sudden the recording feature completely stopped working,! What's most upsetting is that I was e-mailing back and forth tech support for like a month &amp; did not get a solution until I asked them to tell me if they were gonna give me an answer or not... which they did &amp; was a useless solution they basically told me to reset my kindle &amp; delete the app.. I did that &amp; the darn thing still is giving me the same issue -_- is just super upsetting that this is like the first app I ever paid for &amp; the tech support weren't able to fix this issue idk if it's a kindle fire problem or just the app that really sucks, idk if anyone else is having this issue or if y'all know of a solution..
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very engaging game. You never know what it will throw at you, and the evil monkeys are certainly a nice touch. The only thing to criticize about this app is that when you reach the really high distances, the controls get a little bit sketchy. There is nothing else to say; if this game were a little older it would be a classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a good game to play and when you are bored so this isn't a waste of money.I rate five star.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is incredible. Imangi Studios absolutely out did themselves with this one. The graphics are outstanding, the terrain is more interesting, AND THE EVIL MONKEY IS BIGGER!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are are reading this review, then you have already waited too long to get Temple Run 2.

B00846REIS|1.0|Very disappointing book and the end really provided no closure. The sex scenes and language were off were offensive as opposed to erotic or romantic
0553801473|4.0|So if you've read the first three excellent novels and managed to suffer through the fourth than I do recommend a Dance with Dragons. The book is definitely not to the standards of the first three, but it is much more exciting and fun then the dreadful 4th book in the series. The pacing can be quite slow and it appears that there are several throw away chapters (and characters) but one can only assume that GRRM is building toward something great for the next two books. The crap in the middle of the series can be painful to suffer through though. 2,000 pages I've read that I'll never get back. That being said with the bad, there is much good in this book. There are some characters you really enjoy hearing about and some that you love to hate. For some reason I really started to find Tyrion annoying in this book while he was fun in the other books. I guess that is just his character progression but I don't think I like it.<br /><br />It is also very frustrating that the books are coming out at a snails pace and I don't have the patience to re-read these books once every five years or so. So if you you've invested the time already PLEASE GET IT. Its a great series with lots of potential for the future, but you've just started the series, I would wait until it is complete before investing the time and money.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|I'm not great at games (or physics), but I this game is fun. It is a simple, straight-forward game - clear the bubbles to move onto the next, more difficult level. There is some level of physics that come into play that always gets me as I get further along in the game. I enjoy the game and have fun with the challenge of how far I can get.

0670024813|5.0|Most modern books can be visited by reading the prologue; leafing through the main body and Chapter headings; and<br />then jumping to the epilogue, to harvest the main points of the offering.  But not this one.<br /><br />The good Doctor Diamond keynoted the Anaheim national convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, with a title of, \\"The History of Everything In the Past 13,000 years.\\"  Earlier the recepient of the Pultizer Prize in scientific writing, no one questioned his title or his competency to deliver on it.  He has now welded this knowledge to his life-long association with tribal societies, into a manual of how modern societies can adopt what is promotive of life in both societies, into a better life for all.  And whether your interest is in a better diet; use of the talent of the aged; or the rearing of superior children, skipping a Chapter in this text is to miss one fruitful recommendation after the other.<br /><br />A superlative creation of a genius; we are tricked into enjoying it's potential usefulness for contemporary societies, as he weaves the mundane into an exciting story line of how he came to view primitiveness as perhaps what is needed for the survival of our own modern societies.  A vital, and yet fascinating-to-read book for everyone.

B0066WJLU6|3.0|First of all, I must admit I am a klutz at things technical.  I thought this would be handy in case of power shortages, when I wake up at night and don't want to turn on the light, etc. etc.  The problem arises (for me) because there is a rainbow of color choices, with white in the center.  I guess if I used my stylus, I'd get the color choice I wanted.  On the other hand, I can vary the intensity of the color I choose.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|another great book by Nicholas Sparks -  makes you smile right up until the end.  I highly recommend this book for a fun read.

B003G94BZC|5.0|Matt Smith proved with this opening series was the right choice for the eleventh Doctor. His mix of quirkiness and intensity is fantastic. At times his actions seem almost those of a young William Hartnell, with a bit of Patrick Troughton mixed in. Karen Gillian as Amy Pond is an excellent companion. She sometimes can see the answer before the Doctor does. The writing is great. This series will delight Doctor fans all over the world.

1451695195|3.0|I normally refrain from commenting on areas that may seem like I am skeptic or cynic, when I am actually not. I read the book with great interest and this is indeed great storytelling. I am not contesting whether Eben actually experienced this or did parts of his coma awakening brain merely conjure this up, however here are some of my perspectives.<br /><br />a) An expansion of consciousness can lead people to believe that they have a mystical or spiritual experience. I have meditated using powerful brainwave synchronization CDs for over 10 years and I have had an expansion of consciousness which created enhanced sense of imagery and senses. Expansion of consciousness is a survival mechanism that kicks in when people are unable to cope with grief, loss, life or experience altered states of consciousness due to medicine inducement. Post Facto explanation to make sense of what happens actually alters what was really experienced. Anything that you observe you alter it, anything that you re observe, you alter it even more.<br /><br />b) We have had many cases recently where people we thought were ethical all their lives turned out to be unethical and had they not chosen to come along and tell the truth, we would never have known. Eben's story makes it seem like that either educated and specialized people are really experiencing something unique or are possibly using it as marketing gimmick to catapult the sales of their books to a new level. Holy Business is the biggest commercial activity evolving on this planet right now and as it is now a commercial venture, we need to take this with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />Good reading but needs some further thinking.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do Sul all the fans I do recommend all the best Linkin Park ,
B001DHXT6G|4.0|loved this series when it first aired, then again in syndication. the picture quality is excellent, as is the sound...except for the volume of jin kirk's voiceover at the beginning of each episode. it is way too soft. the &#34;new and improved&#34; visuals on the remastered side are very good, and probably DO approximate what gene roddenberry visualized, but i wish the B side, which is supposed to have the original, as originally aired visuals, actually played. for some unknown reason, that side of the discs won't play in my dvd player or computer.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do Sul<br /><br />Just the price and the originally product. I do recommend it .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and addicting game!  it is more realistic than the average app! even small kids will enjoy this game!
0545425115|5.0|I should preface by saying I don't usually read books like The Hunger Games, and when I saw the series getting whole-shelf treatment in bookstores I sniffed derisively and assumed the volumes represented a trilogy of teen trash. I usually read stuff with \\"literary merit,\\" and didn't think this book fit that category, but I'm now forced to rethink that point of view. I had to read the novel for a course, and sighed when I saw it on the list, but I was surprised to find it was good, especially surprised given I'd seen the movie and wasn't impressed. The Hunger Games is a very good read; it's clearly and competently written and has great pace. The peaks and troughs are timed just so, and the story is violent, emotive, and compelling. This book helped make me re-evaluate how I look at literature and made me question what young adult fiction is; isn't the HG more like science fiction? If an adult thinks it has that thing called literary merit, can it be classified as material for young people? Why was I so ready to dismiss it without giving it a chance? Anyway, a great bit of escapism. Now we'll see if Catching Fire and Mockingjay are comparable. I'd recommend this book to almost anybody.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World
B000L43AN4|5.0|This cd is fabulous! Tom Waits is amazing and this cd shows his talents! The songs \\"low down\\" and \\"the road to peace\\" are hands down some of the best songs I've heard. I recommend this cd to anyone who actually likes good music.

B001EBV0NU|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most star-filled, action-packed, political-statement movies I have ever seen. It goes on the classics list with all of the stars that participate in this movie.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|The pace of this movie is perfect for the unpeeling onion of the plot and subplot.  Great acting, dialouge, plot.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|It's okay, trying to move the little cube around and not fall off the platform. It's a good game to play for a little while if you need to pass time in a waiting room, on a bus, whatever.  Not a lot of brain power needed, just a little skill in thinking ahead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You can literally spends hours and hours playing this and getting enough credits to get more games. There are some games that are more challenging than others, and some are very similar to each other, but it is still great to play.<br />Now that we have completed all of the games, I am just waiting for additional games to come out.
0385344333|5.0|I've read all the Reacher books and this is an indispensible addition to the continuing saga. Reacher is getting on in years, but I seriously hope he never retires.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was a gift for my son and he loves it. He will play with is for hours. I think he is stretching it a bit when he says he can get almost all the way to the end right now, but that will come in time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for all ages. My 11 and 18 year old sons both play. My third grade students play. And this mom has a blast with it! Love that they're changing the cities on the world tour.
0525952926|5.0|I waited anxiously for this book to come out after reading Fall of Giants, which is one of the best historical novels that I have read. The historical research is impeccable, and, as in the first installment in the trilogy, I felt as though I learned as much as I could from reading a textbook but it is presented so skillfully that it in no way feels like a dry lecture. Follett presented many important events of WWII from slightly different points of view than is typical giving a fresh picture of the time. He continues to follow the families from Fall of Giants into the next generation, though for some reason I never felt as attached to any of them. In contrast to FoG, there are several major character deaths which were surprising but did not not cause the emotional turmoil for me that I would have hoped for. Because they were too sudden? After the first death it wasn't as surprising, maybe? I'm not sure, but a couple of times I thought to myself, \\"I should be in tears right now.\\" But I was not. I still gave Winter of the World 5 stars because this was really my only critique and the rest of the writing is so amazing and beyond the standard for modern fiction that I just could not rate it anything less. Can't wait for the trilogy's final installment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and so much fun!!! Very easy once you get a hang of it.. Absalutly a must get!!! I love it and enjoy this app a lot. Hope everybody ells does!

1401234550|4.0|The New 52 has not been quite as welcoming to newbies like myself as I would have hoped.  I thought every issue was going to start with an origin story, but that has not been the case.  To be honest, once I have read a few issues I usually have the gist of what is going on.  Green Lantern is seemingly unaffected by the reboot, even more so than any of the other stories.  As far as I can tell, it is a complete continuation of what went before.  As a newbie, I'm sure I should find it off-putting, but it isn't.  There is a great universe in place here, and I am looking forward to slowly unravelling it and figuring out what is going on.<br /><br />Green Lantern volume 1 throws a lot at you right from the start.  Sinestro has been given his ring back despite this clearly not pleasing the Guardians.  Hal Jordan is without a ring.  It appears that when Sinestro last had the ring, he did not do a great job.  He put in place the Yellow Lanterns to protect his planet, but they terrorized it instead.<br /><br />Despite some initial feelings of sympathy towards Sinestro, I quickly realized that he is far from good.  At first I just thought he was cold and without emotion, but actually it is far more complicated than that.  I have no idea whether he will turn out to be a friend or foe to Hal Jordan (although I gather that traditionally they have been enemies), but I'm looking forward to see how the relationship develops.<br /><br />Hal starts the reboot stripped of all his powers-he is deemed too immature to have the ring.  Sinestro decides to give him a replica ring that will last long enough for Hal to help Sinestro clear his planet of the Yellow Guardians.  This was actually a far more interesting story than I anticipated.<br /><br />The artwork was also really strong and the constructs were really clear.  All the green and yellow on the page could look a little garish at times, but I really cannot find much fault with the character drawings and constructs.  Great to look at.<br /><br />The ending was a little unexpected, and I find that I have no idea what is going to happen in future issues.  There is a really big universe established in this series and it is going to take me a while to get to grips with all the mythology.  It should be an enjoyable process though.  I would recommend that other newbies pick this up and get stuck in.  Yes, it may be confusing at times, but not in a frustrating way.<br /><br />8/10
B003XQ2VOG|5.0|This grouping of movies is absolutely awesome.  I grew up watching all of these and to have them in one spot is absolutely wonderful.  Loved them then and I love them now.
0765325950|5.0|I have loved this series.  Like many, I have reread the books many times.  I am sorry that there are not more novels forthcoming.  Five stars for both this novel, and the entire series.  Sanderson did  an excellent job of maintaining Robert Jordan's style.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story line is gripping and the characters are so well portrayed. The cinematography is beautiful. You have to start at season 1 to really get the entire plot line, but season 1 and 2 are available free to Prime subscribers.
B008BWFOVE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and have watched 2-3 times in the past 3 months or so.  Suggest you consult  &#34;bluRay.com&#34; for a professional review of its contents, technical visual and sound quality. In short, not for someone looking solely for sexual thrills  but  rather for one who seeks a serious plot with a few very sexually charged scenes ..all in context of the plot.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|This movie is based off the Frank Miller novel of the same name, where Batman comes out of a long ten year retirement only to return into a Gotham City over ridden by a madness with a bloodthirsty gang known as The Mutants. However, the world is more cynical and cut-throat than most DC Comic Book stories. Half the people are glad that there is once again a Dark Knight lurking in the shadows to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, while the other half consider him as a fascist that is a criminal of not just breaking 'n' entering and batter, but also the civil rights of the very criminals he hunts. He must also fight an even more deranged and even suicidal Two-Face that has now started scratching both sides of his infamous coins, and he must also fight the Mutant leader, a strong brute monster of a man with razor sharp teeth in the prime of his youth, while the Dark Knight is now probably in his late 50's or early 60's.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this movie, but it is all perfectly pace; not too fast or not too slow. I think that is why they broke it down into two parts so that they can avoid repeating the mistake of &#34;Superman: All-Star&#34;. The adventure and story is gritty, gothic, and dark, everything you'd expect from a story about the Cape Crusader. So if you're looking for a DC Comic Book animated movie that is not at all targeted to kids, this is for you! The animation is flawless and spectacular, and with the high-definition of blu-ray it looks incredible, even if it is indeed animation. Even though there aren't any big names that I recognize in this, all the voice acting is fantastic nonetheless. And throughout the movie there are little Easter Eggs throughout the movie that you may only recognize if you're an avid DC Comic reader.<br /><br />Needless to say, I think this is Warner Bros. DC Animation's finest work that can only be topped by Part Two that about immediately follows the timeline of this movie. I definitely recommend buying this movie! I can't help but watch it over and over again, it's that good, and that hardly ever happens with me! So stop reading these reviews and BUY IT NOW! I'm dead serious!

Thank you so much for a flawless present for my sister.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is the story of an ordinary man who is able to inspire others and reach some semblance of closure after a pretty horrific, but banal life -- both professionally and personally, the main character has always kept to the background, and settled for an existence where he didn't make any waves.  Finally, upon finding that a friend is dying, the man sets off on a long walk with little preparation and, as he walks the 500+ miles to his friend's deathbed, is able to resolve a lot of the open issues in his life.<br /><br />Along his journey, he  meets many people and changes his relationship to the world in general, and his wife, in particular.  This is the story of a man who finally begins to live his own life as he looks back on its high and low points.  This story builds slowly s it reveals the details of memories the main character has not thought about deeply.  It can be approached on many levels, from the practical to the philosophical.  Not a page-turner, but it builds slowly, until the reader gradually becomes aware of the arc of Harold Fry's life.

B005S9ELY4|3.0|Gangster Squad was a nice throwback \\"film noir\\" action drama, it steals everything from other great crime movies ,but that is O.K. with me ,it had a lot going for it based on the cast of actors involved.<br />Sean Penn gave a hilarious performance as Mickey Cohen the infamous mobster,and the rest of the cast was good ,at times the movie took it self a little too serious at times to me,the scenes of brutal violence and car chases were well put together by the director,but the best parts of this movie was the Tommy gun battle at the hotel  and the fistfight at the finale absolutely well done,great popcorn flick!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was knowledgely and modestly done by a very disciplined man who was there to share the accurate details of the event.  It is honest; much different that THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN which is mostly political propoganda.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Several pages into the book is so shocking that my heart was telling me turn my face away ...but my mind requested to go on, keep reading,..what's next?...keep reading!<br /><br />The book takes place in a very unforgiving setting where the truth is repressed and women are treated beyond unfair, almost borderline second citizens.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a lightning bold of a character! Can't wait to read the 2nd book
B00B99QTM4|5.0|Worth seeing over and over and over and over...until you get it right!  The details get funnier and more meaningful with each viewing.  This movie is destined to be a classic.

B005LAIGJQ|3.0|This is a fantasy movie about a man, Jack McCall, played by Eddie Murphy, to whom truth is an expendable and frequently abused quality who twists and distorts it in pursuit of his personal goals. Unfortunately, for him, fate, karma, or whatever you may call it, steps in and changes everything. A mysterious tree suddenly appears in his yard and starts dying.<br /><br />The life of the tree is tied into Jack McCall's abuse of words; when he speaks leaves fall off the tree and when they are all gone something terminal may happen to Jack.<br /><br />The movie is full of Eddie Murphy humor and he exhibits his amazing talent with his face and body to communicate with the audience. If you're a fan of Eddie Murphy you'll love this movie. I'm not sufficiently dedicated to his type of humor so I found some parts of the movie somewhat tedious and repetitive.<br /><br />The movie is rather predictable and has the expected happy ending as you've probably already guessed; it is rated PG-13 and is generally inoffensive. I would suggest you watch it first; I will probably not watch it again.

0964385619|5.0|I love this book and have read it several times! As the author of [[ASIN:B00B33XNH0 Get your Life Back on Track: A Step by Step Practical Guide to Making Success Happen]]I used this and other books like it to inspire me on my way to success and achievement. A must read...
B004LZFWJO|4.0|play it on the most difficult setting. It will give brain and eyes a run for the money. And the easy mode is great for the kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story.  Kept my interest from start to finish. A real page turner.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I grew up on comic books, the best super hero's to me were the batman, punisher,and green arrow types. Normal humans who through force of will and training become super heroes themselves. This version steers clear of corporate bad poor good. No 1% vs 99%, instead it focuses on the right vs wrong. Great acting, perfect balance of drama vs action. And the story arc is paced very well.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed a lot a learned a thing or two about hat it means to b yourself and puck your battles.  Recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's great fun. It's challenging without being overly frustrating. Definite must have for any mobile device. I have it on my Kindle Fire and play it everyday.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is really a 10 star set.  I love that you can watch both seasons at once without waiting for them to come pn TV.  It is a real addition to our DVD collection
B003B02OOG|4.0|I am not usually a 'reader', but I did complete this book and enjoyed it very much.  Couldn't wait to read the next story.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Okay—I'm a mush and an Anglophile. Harold's story is not all smooth sailing. As he runs into rough spots, so does the narrative at times, and friends who've read it objected to the ending, but I'm cutting everybody a lot of slack here. I found it a delightful read, just believable enough (I have known such ordinary-seeming English folk to harbor a deep vein of eccentricity just waiting for the moment to erupt.) to keep me following along, but with sufficient fantasy to satisfy my innocent love of positive stories.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was awesome. I would totally give this book 5 stars. It is sad , happy, funny and it might even make you cry.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I would recommend it to eveybody in love with best quality shows, songs, singer and of course is a fan of Leonard Cohen poetry and voice....
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Thought this would be fun turned out to be a bore fest, I just did not like this game at all..
B00992CF6W|5.0|so well made mojang did a great job on this app if only 0.6.0 would come out now and and and and and and and I so majestic
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is so realistic.The horse's are so Beautiful it make you feel like your taking cake of a real horse
B001P3SA8U|5.0|This movie, which I had been wanting to see for a very long time, was everything I had expected it to be and more.  The [Blu-ray] edition made the visuals true-to-life and the audio just immersed you in the feeling of that time (any movie about music, in which the music is the real star, had better &#34;bring it on&#34;.  I would recommend &#34;Cadillac Records&#34; to anyone who enjoyed a compelling story, loved music, and wanted to see the real truth about what so many claim is &#34;rock and roll&#34;.  No disrespect but Elvis wasn't king of s***, he was a pretender, as are all the so called &#34;rock and rollers&#34; even unto this day.  I was a preteen during the time depicted in &#34;Cadillac Records&#34; and I know this story to be true, dramatized for sure, but true none the less; it touched me and moved me and took me back to when I first heard these trailblazing artists on the one tube Am radio.  Writing this review makes me want to go watch it again, and I will,... forget the Super Bowl.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fantastic. Totally addicting. It's going to take you over and make you want to play it over and over. I'm so glad my friend found it in the at&t store or we wouldn't be so addicted. I love it!
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old loves this book! Great addition to her collection. Would highly recommend it. Love that its hard cover too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome you can jump and compete wash it horse get new horses unicorns and zebras color changing unicorns this is a great kids game
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing and addicting but dies anybody know when the update for the game is coming out? all apple devices already have it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app and I never have a problem with it<br /> I like the idea of it and it is addicting and fun to play
B00B2V66VS|3.0|All in all I love the game but I have it on my kindle and after like a day I had it, it wount open it shuts down. Not cool at all. Specially after all the coins I got. Please Fix ASAP!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game ever that's the least I can say. It's so good. At my house on all of our IPods,IPads,Kindles we have minecraft. It's so awesome u can collect butter(gold) and diamonds unlike the free version. I would talk more but I would fill the whole page. LOL.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. It's a great game. It's just that my brothers have Apple products and already got the new update while it has been like 5 days and I haven't. Really great game though. The game is worth every penny I paid for it!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I did not  like the format  of  the  book. Also the  words  we're  not as I thote they would be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game very addictive even better the fact it's free it would be good to see subway surfers 2-4
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I just always like the show, it does make me fell better knowing that Al Bundy's problems are bigger then mine!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is awesome except for a gglitch I hit once that sent me from times 30 to 1 I love the game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|could not put it down.absolutely intoxicating,just ignites your sensuality and addicts you to the saga.You have to anticipate the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my only complaint is its one where you need to pay or wait like 8 hours to do anything. other than that its somewhat additive
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I first heard the songs FITZPLEASURE on iTunes free music, and SOMETHING NEW on KCRW's Today's Top Tune of the Day. These 4 guys are incredibly talented and my best find of the past 12 months.  Their style has a huge range, from acoustic to electronic, all of it very, very intelligent and displaying an attention to detail and sophistication not usually found in freshmen efforts, regardless of the the raw talent involved. No wonder they won the Mercury Prize (whatever that is, Google it I guess). Have been playing the album on repeat for 4 days now.<br /><br />Definitely, head over to Music Downloads and listen to the 30 second samples of the disc. If that doesn't convince you, watch/listen to some of the free stuff available on the net, then come back here and buy the download.<br /><br />It's fantastic and you're going to love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun.<br />My sister loves it. My brothers love it.<br />My mom and dad love it<br />Its a great game for all ages<br />:)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Being able to tote along my kindle instead of a bulky heavy Bible has been great. It's easy to get to the chapters and verse and easy to see.
B002O01I9Q|5.0|Having been an MK fan since the early days of Dire Straits I fell into his solo career as a natural by product of just simply wanting more.  On Every Street was a much under appreciated album with songs like You & Your Friend and of course the sublime Planet of New Orleans not to mention the beautiful title track.  MK's early solo work still had similar sounding tracks to latter Dire Straits albums but I have to admit shying away by the time Ragpicker's Dream came out.  There didn't seem to be enough bite for me.  Boy am I glad the years have taken their toll and done a good job of shaping my listening ear.  Revisiting Ragpicker's Dream & especially Get Lucky have served to give me a new appreciation for MK.  His oh so subtle brilliance is best heard in these 2 discs.  In my opinion his enormous talents have never been felt better than on tracks like The Car Was The One, Cleaning My Gun and the opening track Border Reiver but it just doesn't get better for me than the beautiful So Far From The Clyde.  MK's mixture of Celtic beauty and sea faring chantey runs through this disc better than any that came before.  If you love MK buy this disc and buy it now.  It will NOT disappoint I promise you.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great! Well developed characters, humor,and suspense combine in this series. I really like the flash forwards in black and white
B005OCFGTO|1.0|These movies are crappy!!  They are obviously bootleg.  They are dark, grainy, and at least one of the ones I have doesn't work.  When i opened the case the first time, all of the movies fell out.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!!
B004HD61KE|3.0|These books generally are fun reads: exciting and move fast. I thought this one was a little too far out. It bogged down in too much detail and generally did not hold my interest.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game....wish I could get more gems Easter. Also level to level is a lot of points......and energy needs to b Easter to get...aka gems.....begin u canter play anything after its gone.....but I'm always  play in and I'm 27' I feel like I own a horse now calligraphic r Greatttt. My 2 yr old son thinks Playn with a horse is great fun too
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|27500 coins all puzzles complete received all bonuses now I keep getting more coins and nowhere else to go. Fun while getting there.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|This movie is fun for the WHOLE family! It's colorful, full of lively music and has a sweet story line. We watch it over and over!
B005LAJ17M|1.0|It is too buggy and asks you to insert the first disc after you've finished watching it. Do not buy the Blu-ray version.
1451695195|5.0|This book represents answers to the final myth about death ... that the brain hallucinates at the time of death and presents scenarios, people and things that are only product of the brain.  This book refutes that and proves, by one neurosurgeon who went through a near-death experience himself, the reality of heaven is just what it is promised to be.  Real.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it takes forever to download. I'm still waiting for it to finish download. it looks really fun!!!! I cant wait.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I cannot get my $ back because I ordered the wrong thing and now I &#34;own it.&#34;  Son-of-a-gun, I will not sit at my computer and watch this thing.  (I'm over 70)
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|So I bought this gun to battle it out with my friends. But I quickly came to realize that it is just straight up not very fun to play with. There is no way to aim it very well and you empty all your darts in like 45 sec. So if you are playing with a bunch of people without automatic guns its just kind lame. You end up pelting them with half powered darts and they get you with a well aimed shot to your face.<br />So I ended up going back to the store and buying a Retaliator, which is way more fun and just snagged all the clips from the Hail-Fire. So my recommendation is, don't get this big thing and maybe get a Triad or even a Jolt. They are both sweet guns, allow you to reload quickly, and are still super powerful. The Retaliator is also an awesome choice if you want a sweet big gun.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World is a compelling read.  Phyllis couldn't put it down; she love's historical novels.  We have a waiting list of friends who want to borrow it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly good it is a great mix of temple run 1 and jet pack joyride. 5 star review such a good game I can't say anything bad about it
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think the game is cool because I went and battled and beat the first boss  and now I am on wave 11
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has me on my toes and hoping to beat my friends high score every time I play. Great, yet simple game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great time killer when I am sitting in an airport or sitting in a plane flying somewhere. It was free and I am really happy I downloaded it. I suck at it though.
B008RNYNDM|4.0|This movie was a crazy ride. Not for the faint of heart - extremely racy. Definitely not for eveyone. I love Roger Daltrey and love everything he is in. Maybe not so much for content, but think he is a good actor.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This cracks me up, I really like what thebird people came up with here. I love all the star wars inspired aspects of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thoroughly engrossed from about halfway through the book, Suzanne Collins captured me with the final book of the hunger games trilogy.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A very good book. Story kept me interested throughout. I would definately recommend it to some one who is interested in that period of history.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app its so much fun I love to edit photos the effects are really super cool this app is amazingly awesome.
B000002PCS|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. This is one of my very favorites. I could listen to it over and over. Well done. Obviously I love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun app...kids enjoy it.! a variety of activities and good sound effects really draws players in and keeps them entertained._Should be a bit easier to gain gems or lower the 'prices' on some of the other horses and tack.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Absolutely no problems with my Fire HD 7\\". Like it much better than my iPhone 4. Nothing bad to say at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|keeps me entertained every time I'm on my kindle fire! it's never ending fun! I never get tired of it! take my advice and get this app!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never read such a series and never wanted to put it down. After completing the series I had to re-read again after seeing what Christian had been through in his life. Loved it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like it, but now I am hooked -- can't wait for next season to start!
1938469011|5.0|I really like the &#34;For the love of...&#34; series of books for home-brewing.  I own the Yeast For the love of, and have on order, Water.  Hope they do a Grain and Formula book someday!
B005OGS5BG|5.0|Already knew I liked the movie, just wanted to own it on blu ray. It showed up in about 3 days after ordering, and had no damage. Looked like I had gone to the store to pick it up!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is a great show! I love it! Once you see one episode you will be hooked! Dr. House Rocks! Its sad that the ride is over..but what a ride it was! Execellent show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time.  It's my favorite game, my friends and I play against each other to get the high score.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I do like it a alot it is much larger than my smart phone and thne picture is good  I am  please
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I love this book. As a D1 wrestler who used to pack on the weight in the off season I know a ton about losing weight quickly. While this isn't going to work like eating toilet paper and running in a sauna, it will help you lose weight fairly fast. And it's not a starvation diet thing, you'll actually probably eat more. I don't really buy into anything in the book other than the diet portion, but its all an interesting read
B009UX2YAC|3.0|no directions on how to play. should have beginner level. game runs too fast to learn how to play.  will probably be trashing this game.  too frustrating
B004L03B3S|5.0|From Beginning to End starts at the beginning, a very good place to start.  The voice over is helpful to the story, the children are delightful actors, as are the parents.  Much of the emotion is told through facial expression and movement, lending quiet thoughtfulness to the film.  The actors that play the adult half-brothers in love are unshy and nice to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is so much better than anything on &#34;regular&#34; TV!!  It makes me feel like I'm reading one of my favorite books about the Kings & Queens of England and the lifestyle of the World War I era.  Everything and everyone is superb on this series, but Episode 5 of Season 3 still has me feeling the shockwaves!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|same as the original but with better levels in my opinion. would recommend to fans of the original games version.
B000J0OANO|5.0|Item arrived on time and as described.  It is a really fun game and I couldn't afford to buy it new.  Glad for the used option.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|With nothing to compare it to, I'd say it is great. I have used it quite a bit already. OK
B009IF8CH6|3.0|Pretty standard sitcom.. makes me laugh ocassionally.  I think they could make it funnier, for sure.  But I enjoy this show, overall.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This was requested by a little boy for Christmas. I'm assuming he liked it since, he asked for this movie.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|special effects were amazing.. but i was embarrassed to hear that Ridley Scott just wanted \\"have fun\\" while making this movie.  Well, Ridley, if you wanted to \\"have fun\\" while making a movie and have millions of people pay their hard earned cash to watch it?  Why not just YouTube yourself while riding a go-cart for 2 hours and yelling \\"Weeeeeee!\\" at the top of your lungs at certain intervals to keep us entertained.<br /><br />Using the 2 scientists who were fatally attacked by the alien white snakes was actually supposed to be \\"comic relief\\" according to the director.  Makes sense!  Why else would a \\"scientist\\" that is lost in a bunch of dark tunnels on an alien planet use his helmet as a holder for bong smoke?<br /><br />And let's use the old cliches:<br /><br />\\"We're going to explore a possibly hostile planet - but you better NOT carry your weapons! you don't know what might be out there!\\"<br /><br />the white alien snakes:  The moment i saw them hunting down the scientists, i knew EXACTLY where they were headed: up some one's As&*&* or down someone's throat.  Since watching Slither/Night of the Creeps, it was inevitable..<br /><br />Another cliche:  Hey, i'm bored - let's have sex!<br /><br />And let's talk about the impossible:<br /><br />5 circles with people pointing at them crudely drawn on cave walls.  some pointing right - some pointing left.<br /><br />from these crude drawings - a course was plotted 300 hundred TRILLION miles away. How in the hell do they know which way to go?  this takes place in 2089. Folks - we're in 2012 already.  My GPS system RE-ROUTES 10 miles after giving it instructions. And here, they're plotting a course, from DRAWINGS.. on a CAVE WALL..written in CRAYON.. of 5 circles..which THEY decided is 300 TRILLION MILES AWAY.. yeah.. okay..<br /><br />For all we know those people could have been pointing at 5 turds that refused to flush - and they needed an intergalactic plumber to help them.  They WERE standing at a distance from the circles, if you hadn't noticed.<br /><br />Another impossibility:  Running at break-neck speed with Charlize Theron after a cesarean birth. Charlize Theron can run - and to try keeping up with her after an operation? okay...<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and a vindictive android.  that just took the cake, Ridley.. no, let's add ICING to \\"said\\" cake. a vindictive android - that dyes his hair because he admires Peter O'toole, and watches Lawrence of Arabia...<br /><br />No wonder Michael Fassbender opted out on the sequel - which was too bad - he's the ONLY reason i watched the movie in the first place.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|Its pretty good! But the second kindle fire sucks! The first generation kindle fire does more things than all the new generation kindles including the HD kindle!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All I can say is Wow!  I wanted to be Katie falling in love with Alex and his family.  Loved the curveball with Jo at the ending...that was special.  What a great book and the movie's coming out this month!
B000J10ER4|4.0|The movie appeared in good condition.  Another movie I like better in full screen format which I was glad was able to find.  It was a speedy shipment.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My kids love this app, it is great for puzzles.  But it is too sensitive for the location of the pieces.  My youngest child can get the pieces close to where they need to go but can't exactly line it up perfectly and the piece always bounce back to the start.  He gets so frustrated.  It would me nice to have options to decrease the sensitivity for younger children.  Also more content would be good. There really are only a couple of puzzles.
B002OHDRF2|5.0|The DVD was in good condition, picture and sound quality were good as well.  I was thankful to find this movie in full screen format, because I like that format better!  It was a speedy delivery, didn't have to wait too long.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 3 year old absolutely loves this game although she doesn't quite grasp the concept we spend hours playing together. Sometimes I think I like it more than she does. Great game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another book that leads you in suspense.  Great read for sure, can't wait to finish the series.  Hopefully all the hanging questions will be answered.
140131046X|5.0|Any Mitch Albom book is a good read.  He writes from the heart and every story has a message.  I bought two copies of this book and gave one as a gift to my dad.  I felt inspired and moved by this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really entertaining with all the activities you can do with your horse. All the activities such as feeding your horse keeps me occupied.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought this to keep my phone and Kindles charged when traveling and am very satisfied. It charges items quickly and lives up to its marketing in terms of the number of charges it can make before needing to be recharged itself. It comes with a thick, soft mesh carrying case with drawstring that is just big enough to include the battery and the connectors.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|its fun and great for the whole family .<br />I mean that's my opinion but yeah I like it a lot I have the first one too so get it now
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Okay, I'm hooked. These puzzles are really fun and nice to play even when you only have a few minutes.<br /><br />I find that the solutions either jump right out at me, or I get totally stumped. When I'm stuck, I find that if I put it down and come back to it later, the solution will usually be so obvious to me when I return.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was great!  Even my wife couldn't wait to see the next episode.<br />This came out a few years too early.  I wish they had something this good on TV today.<br />Fox really dropped the ball when they ended this.
B000AS4L16|3.0|I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD. It is very blurred and only parts of it is a good quality. This is the only copy of Shoah I have seen, so I can't compare it with anything else.<br />I do think (A History of the Holocaust) Is misleading, as this DVD was mostly about Treblinka
B001KOFH2G|5.0|It was great!  They kept all the Firefly characters.<br />I wish they had made more movies.<br />I was sorry to see it end.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Victor Frankl shows himself to be very timely even years after the event he describes. His insight into human behavior continues to offer guidance in our current experiences. Though the tragic events have their own authenticity, the lessons Dr. Frankl provides are freshly verified in out times. A better appreciation of humans' ability to find meaning in the slightest or most tragic events could provide a bridge across cultures and individual experiences and reveal a bond of humanity.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult did it again. In this dramatic exploration of what it means to love, and the sacrifices made, Picoult vividly paints the relationship between a boy and a girl in love. Until it all came crashing down. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, romance, and believes that life is not black and white.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Classic!  a movie that transcends all generations; the movie is fantastic and the portraial of high schoolers is universal - different clothers, different lingo, but same in 1950 as in 2013!
0446547573|5.0|I loved it. Did not want to put it down. I can hardly wait to see the movie. Nicholas Sparks makes you laugh, cry, and bite your nails. I want to read all of his books!
B00782O7NE|4.0|Simple story but very original approach for today....it amazed me how much more attention one pays to the non verbals and the details when there is no oral dialogue in place.
072325804X|5.0|Loved her books as a kid. they were tiny books in the library and I adored the pictures. Got this for my grandkids. I know they will love her books as much as I did. A must for every childs book shelf.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|This is a product I didn't hesitate to buy because when I first saw it at the movie theater I said I had to have it when I start my movie collection. The product was properly packed and fast to be delivered. I have no complains at all!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The cover fits my need for now. Everyone needs a cover to protect your device from scrathes. This cover was very low cost and nice.
0439023521|5.0|I was skeptical towards The Hunger Games at first, considering it bases itself on the idea of kids killing kids. However, when I picked up the novel, I understood that it was so much more than that. I knew that this novel was not encouraging such violence, but rebelling against it. Also, I picked up on The Hunger Games reflection of modern society. Children and families across the Earth are starving, and yet the more powerful countries do next to nothing about the situation.<br /><br />The Hunger Games also has strong basis in feminism. Unlike other teen novels, The Hunger Games portrayed a strong heroine that does not base her story primarily on a love triangle, but on a quest of rebellion as well. This a wonderful book for children about 6th grade and up. Katniss is an amazing role model, and each character has something definite about them. If you have any questions about handing this book to your kid, don't worry about it. Don't hesitate with Catching Fire either. However, Mockingjay is a little intense. Happy reading, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I received this as a Christmas gift and was told I'll either hate or love it. I loved it. I finished it within hours of starting it, read her other two books days apart and purchased all three as gifts for my mother and mother-in-law, avid readers who also enjoyed her work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I like play this game everyday so much fun I love playing I play with my friends or on my kindle my phone or my I pod touch this game is so addicting
B0027MJU00|5.0|I received Gone Girl as a Christmas Gift then proceeded to purchase her other works after reading. This is a great story. Unlike her other novels in this book I could identify (to a degree) with the main character and really enjoyed her point if view. Definitely worth the time it takes to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Overall I thought it was a good game. It was fun, interesting, and a good time waster. It was also very easy to play.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I received Gone Girl as a Christmas Gift then proceeded to purchase her other work after reading. Great story with a twist. In my opinion this is her best work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am so glad that they got this game for my kindle i have been waiting forever i love this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a good game but i wish that you would put more items in the store so it would be better
B007V2UGPE|5.0|A very fun game with some cool moments I wish the combat was a little better though. It is worth the 0 dollars
B00B7FWWNA|1.0|Disgusting film.  Disgusting topic and weak, weak storyline.  Helen Hunt's talent is wasted in this film.  Film was not entertaining to me.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Gets your brain working.... I love it. It has the potential to get boring, but then the playing field expands creating more challenges!
B00007BHOE|5.0|This dvd is so awsome beyond words for TRUE maggots take my advice (O.G. maggot for 10+ years). if you love slipknot you WILL love this! I have been watching this DVD since it was released in 2002 over and over it never gets old to me (i can tell you word for word litteraly). i listen to Death Metal now however slipknot is still and ALWAYS will be my favorit band because how heavy and agressive Iowa and self titled are. so if your a maggot and havent seen this and you love iowa and self titled get it and get ready for the best dvd hands down.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson Greatest Hits-Chapter contains a variety of her music.  If you are a Kelly Clarkson fan, I highly recommend this CD. You will listen to it a lot, as I do.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I still think Sean Connery was the best Bond but Craig does a good job of protraying our favorite spy. Not as much humor as the original Bond and Craig  plays him much colder and human. Bond does not seem invincible for the first time which I think is a bad thing.  We want our heros to win especially in this day and age.  I really liked the roof top chase scene. Very different and exciting.  Dame Judy was excellent as usual and I am sorry to see her go since she was one of the best &#34;M&#34;s around. We do need help on some new villains and &#34;Q&#34;.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|This is my second pair of Keen's Newport.  The first pair lasted me five years, three of which were all I wore in Africa.  They took a beating and never fell apart.  If I did not ware through the soles I would probably not have replaced them.  I still use the old one's for around the house, keeping the new one's for when I go out.
0786955554|5.0|The best part I see is the box!  What a wonderfully diverse and rounded set for the cost.  I am so happy, and, as the DM, you know that if I am happy, my players are happy!
B00AHJVYC2|4.0|I bought the first and second seasons for my husband for Christmas. We don't have HBO but have seen the previews many times and every time, he makes a comment about wanting to watch the show. He loves it. But not surprising, because the acting, directing, and writing is very good.  The price was really nice as well, especially for blu ray. The only problem I had was the shipping took twice as long as they had told me. Almost to the point of calling customer service to see what had happened. Which sounds a little silly because they always give you tracking, but the tracking wasn't reliable (the only time this has ever happened to me when ordering from Amazon). I would check the shipping and for about a week, it said it was being moved from the facility to the carrier. Then for the rest of the time, even when I received it, it said it was in Dallas, TX, which I live outside of Tulsa, OK and it's only about a 5hr drive. Needless to say, it was frustrating. But I got it and everything is good now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better than the first one. fun to play! one of my favorite games to play, and it is not slow at all

B003ODIZL6|1.0|To all the girls  if the boy you like doesn't  like you then  they aren't worth it or your time
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only reason I rated this four stars is the fact that it is in Alpha. Now, for those of you who don't know, Alpha is like a Beta of a game, but worse. It has practically none of the creative items of the Xbox version, let alone PC. My advice? Get the PC version if you love the creative mode of this game. For a game that's still in it's early stages, it is exceptional. Brohoof for any bronys reading this, and brofist for the pewdiepie fans reading this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice simple to use app nice to  have when you need to add a few items and  its.  free so you cant. Beat the price
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was so great!!!!!I just want to read more and more and more and more and more and more and more
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a fun game. like temple run. i would recommend it. has changes every once in awhile so that's nice and lots of characters to choose from. good price too.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Excellent and well written. The translations in French to English could have been easier to access.  Some meaning was lost without this feature. The section about slang was overdone. Excellent theme for all times.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is great!  My husband is addicted which gives me time to do other things around the house like homework, puzzles, and crocheting.

B0045XGRQE|2.0|great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring!  very little charachter development and very  obvious speical effects a no go
B000IKQMFO|4.0|Ypu'll need the subtitles for this one. The writer for Downton Abbey wrote the screenplay for this movie and you can see the similarities.  Good murder mystery.
B00ABO573A|3.0|had plot, complex characters, good actors and no one died!  what more could you ask for in a gay themed movie.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This film looks great visually, but is too uneven. I found myself stating over and over...\\"Now-who is this...again?\\"  In my opinion there are some ridiculous scenes that come out of no-where. POSSIBLE SPOILER- BUT I DON'T THINK SO: I WILL JUST MENTION A SCENE OR TWO--The most preposterous being when snow white is trying to escape and ends up on the beach where there just happens to be a gorgeous healthy white horse sitting by the water. Of course she rides it full tilt to escape the posse. Snow herself most of the time is in full make up with long fake eyelashes (a close up in the forest reveals the eye lashes) This is after 10 years in prison and weeks in the dark forest and trudging through city sewers.<br />Although the direction and flow was poor, the acting was very good from the cast. At times a tad over-acting from Snow white with her riling up the troops speech and the queen, who I thought would collapse from stress and anger in her dialogue; but all in all pretty good.<br /><br />Not to give any more of the movie away, there are several other inconsistencies in the film from beginning to end. I was not impressed. It is also overly long and clocks in at over two hours. This would have been a fun \\"after school special\\" like you would watch in the old days of TV. A teleplay with some nice visuals and decent acting...but nothing that you would want to see again and should have been about 60 minutes long. (with commercials)  I would suggest a rent only. We streamed it on Amazon for the cost of a large Mocha Frappachino (sp). I regret not getting the Frap instead. I would have saved 2+ hours.  It gets 2 stars for the visuals, which are very nice.<br /><br />The rest of the film: sticks tongue out and blows to make sound.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|Maybe it is Michael C. Hall who was in Six Feet Under,  or perhaps it was other elements, but something about Hall and shows like Dexter and Six Feet Under seem insidious. Recently I watched the first three seasons of Dexter. I must say the show plods along trying to build up some momentum. The lack of momentum is not helped by the weak scripts and acting. And in the final episode, or the one just before that one, was pretty bad. Dexter kills the \\"Skinner\\" by snapping his neck. In the struggle the Skinner cuts Dexter. Dexter's blood was left at the crime scene. Somehow the blood evidence didn't connect to Dexter. The blood evidence wasn't even mentioned or perhaps collected, for it was never cited in the show. I've watched a lot of CSI, eleven seasons, and four seasons of CSI Miami and if one is to believe anything about forensics investigations then Dexter's ass would have been in jail from the collected blood evidence. Also, Dexter threw the Skinner from a second story in the warehouse and not one police officer or detective saw him. The committed viewer is askde to conclude that the \\"Skinner\\" committed suicide by cop car and for NO apparent reason. That was the explanation given by Dexter's sister, Debra Morgan/Jennifer Carpenter, the newest detective of the precinct. We are to believe that the state coroner would not see signs of a forced broken neck or bruising from the struggle. Then another thing that bugged me was the CI, the criminal informant, who got two huge pieces of skin removed from his back, he is never shown in the hospital. The CI healed up basically overnight. Where and when did the CI get skin graphs? The skin graphs would have had to come from his own body. The CI would have been out of action for several months, at least with much painful recuperation time. Why was that glossed over? Then detective Angel Batista gets in a relationship with a blonde detective. The two have a very a sweet connection which was suppossed to be his personal redemption from his demons, demons that led him to prostitutes and what not. Why did the relationship \\"evaporate\\" and END at the conclusion of season 3? I am guessing the woman who played the blonde detective did not come back for season 4. So early in the first or second episode of season four, Angel is over at María LaGuerta/ Lauren Vélez and the two of them proceed to have sex. And Angel Batista goes from a very healthy relationship to a very seedy one. Also, I'd like to ask a question which is probably on the minds of many people, is Jennifer Carpenter ANOREXIC? Her name might be Jennifer but she looks to be living like Karen Carpenter from the Carpenters who we all know DIED from anorexia.<br /><br />Ultimately I sold all four seasons of Dexter, not having watched 90% of season four because I almost had a couple of panic attacks. I haven't had those for years and I watch lots of horror, sci fi, etc. But I will say that Six Feet Under also disturbed me. I think it might just be Michael C. Hall. Yes, I know he's almost your lovable serial killer in this tv series but ultimately this show bothered my conscience. It seemingly disturbed me on a deep level, or it helped to upset me. I'm not much of a Christian but I was much more of one about 20 years ago and I tried sincerely to live a Christian life. Ultimately I felt like I was putting horrific garbage into my mind. I mean we live in a world and a country where serial killing is commonplace but yet we have a show, a very seedy one, that celebrates a serial killer. The celebrated serial killer also becomes a biological father, a step father for two, and a husband. Yes, I know Dexter kills people who escaped justice, but combine all the killing with some nudity, a tremendous amount of profanity, throw in some creepy visions from \\"the father\\" and you have some images and situations for a mind to dwell upon. This show may have helped me to almost have two panic attacks, or it may be that I might soon be buying my brother out of the house we inherited from our mother. Surely Dexter was a part of my anxiety, so I took the four seasons to the pawn shop and got $12 for the lot.<br /><br />I am still curious as to how that show would have proceeded. The part of me that wants to be entertained is pissed at the part of me that has a troubled conscience. Call it a good instinct of mine or call me some sort of crazy weak minded coward but I just simply chose to put the show Dexter out of my life. A show like Dexter can be entertaining but it also desensitizes us to very real horror. Just this week I saw a news story about mice in the police evidence locker at Wichita, Kansas. The mice ate some marijuana evidence. I couldn't help but be reminded of Dennis Rader the infamous BTK Killer who Bound, Tortured and Killed women in Wichita. Dennis Rader is THE real serial killer of Wichita, Kansas. He lived and worked amongst the people of Wichita. He was considered by many to be a model citizen. Rader had a wife, kids, and was a deacon in the church and on the side he KILLED REAL LIVE WOMEN for kicks. He was caught when the police traced a computer disc back to a computer he had used at his church. He taunted the church with messages he created on a church computer. That was his downfall. And how much Dennis Rader had in common with Dexter the tv serial killer.<br /><br />I gave Dexter and Showtime three Seasons on dvd, that much of my life, and in the end it probably didn't help me at all emotionally, spiritually or intellectually but I guess I was entertained for a while, or as entertained as one can be by such a seedy, weak show. Compare Dexter to HBO's The Sopranos, it's the same sort of crap shoot. That being said I have every season of The Sopranos and NO, I don' think the viewing experience has done me any good but, OH YES, it entertained me for seven seasons. It's amazing the garbage we put into our minds as we seek to be entertained. I guess for the most part we will never learn. I wonder howmany disturbed people will be influenced by Dexter? Oh, and I still have a desire to watch Dexter, I just need to remember to summon the wisdom not to watch it.

0061438294|5.0|Really did you read the title? Read this book.<br /><br />Most of what you were taught about spotting a liar or telling if somebody is really interested in you, is wrong.<br />Mr. Navarro, tells it clearly, and why it works. He also teaches courses to professional poker players, so if they are willing to learn from him, so should you!<br /><br />This is my second time through the book, and I keep picking up more nuances about the people around me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is absolutely insane and it's so addictive!!! It is so fun and it won't let you get bored easily. When you read this reveiw, GET THIS AWESOME APPPPPP!!!
0802130208|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. I love the (more or less!) exaggerated characters (all of whom reminded me of real people), and the author's take on human nature. It surprises me that some people,few though they are, don't find humor in it; I think it wouldn't surprise Toole, though! They could have been characters in a future book had he lived. RIP, JKT.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|enjoy playing this game.  it's keeps you thinking, and will pass the time of day. just wish they would fix the glitch in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun. It is a great twist on temple run an  jetpack joyride. It is definitely my favorite game to play on my kindle fire.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive.I play it every single day.the different challenges prizes keep it New.it is especially fun to try and beat all of your friends high scores since it connects with face book
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is good and fun. may get a little boring afterwards. The 2 things I don't like are 1.it's hard to collect a lot of money. 2. It's hard to collect a lot of money because out of nowhere u start running extra fast and start to run into things, almost like your not controlling it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its only ok because it does not go were you tap it if you do not tap it hard enough.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Makes me miss my horses but still keeps my attention! Much better than cleaning out the real stalls! Very good graphics and the speed us fairly decent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very fun game, I would recommend it for anyone who likes temple run. I think it is better than temple run. In my opinion it is way better than temple. Probably the best game ever invented!!!!
B007ZKY7XO|3.0|I hate digipak. Didn't know the deluxe edition was made this way until it arrives home. But it's ok. I like Scissor Sisters' sound.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good and the new runner is nice and easy-to-use she's much more versatile and flexible it seems also as though she makes the games running speed increase earlier than the other characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|had a little problen with this game on the kindle fire in the beginning with it not opening but after reinstalling it, theres only seven letters to describe this game. a-w-e-s-o-m-e
0393927938|5.0|This was a total lifesaver for class, cheap and a good read and way easier to get than any other textbooks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've always loved English dramas and this one is no exception. The characters are real and engaging. The story lines are moving. And the subtle stabs the lady dowager makes in her comments always have me laughing. I am always left wanting more.  I don't see myself tiring of this drama anytime soon.
0547884591|2.0|I had high hopes with his book and although it was entertaining, I did not learn much (I am a good cook).<br /><br />Also, Tim seems a little full of himself.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This Mitch Rapp has more of an edge to him.  As though he is sick of the way the government plays games and uses people.  He just wants to get the job done.  As always, couldn't put it down, loved it.
0061990477|5.0|Read this book and saw the movie years ago and bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loved it!!  Great story.
B002VWNID6|2.0|So I love this movie, but look for a different DVD version to buy. This one reminded me of an 8-track or vinyl record. Half the movie is recorded on one side and the other half on the other side. It stops abruptly in the middle of the movie. At first, I thought something was wrong with the DVD and wanted to return it to Amazon. Then I took it out and noticed it was dual layer, so I turned it over and tried that. But seriously, why even bother. A DVD is plenty large enough to hold this movie. There aren't any special features on here to take up space.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I don't know of anyone that doesn't love Michael Buble's music. My family has started a new tradition to play his music every Christmas.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this novel, though it wasn't quite as amazing as some critics would have had you believe.  But lots of fun, and a little bit of a throwback.  I don't want to say much more for fear of giving away the plot device.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Very good series to watch. Its entertaining for all age groups with a lot of twists and turns and alot of plotting.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is awesome! I think this game is awesome because, there is no pop up advertisments!! In most free games I have downloaded there are almost always pop up advertisements! Also this game is SUPER fun!! I LOVE chasing the animals to try to get them in the crates! But I would recommend this game to 13 and under.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great and very fun game. Ive only just downloaded it and already love it. Best horse game I have found so far, pleased with it.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I loved the strong characters and that, even though this is about teenagers, it hooked me in (and I'm a 58-year-old).  I also loved the dilemmas faced and the passion of the book.  Better than the Twilight Saga
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|Great sounds that make your heart beat more! This album is on constant play in my house and car right now!!<br />Wonderful music!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Enough said - if you enjoyed the Twilight saga, this trilogy is even better and stronger.  I loved the characters!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I personally did not enjoy this movie.  Just thought it was predictable and perhaps formulaic?  Anyway, I would suggest renting it before buying it.
B003954I9C|5.0|Aj's voice is so beautiful. I was very excited to find this album on Amazon because I looked everywhere else and I couldn't find it. The album is great, I have London on repeat. Great song. Definitely my favorite Backstreet Boy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like a gram that makes me think and this one does. You have to pay real close attition to find what you are looking for.
0316069434|1.0|This was the worst Michael Connelly book I have ever read.  It was sophomoric, boring and had an inconceivable plot.  Horrible.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband and I really like this game takes alot of attition to get it right.<br />Some of them are harder than others.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|This book didn't do much more than scratch the surface and did little to offer ways to improve. It was interesting though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is Super fun and challenging. Playing Rio version right now. Original is just as fun. Love them both. So fun its addictive.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As expected from G5 this game is a lot of fun with excellent graphics challenging mini games and plenty of scenes to navigate. I am always looking forward to the next one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was good learning that the staff had a story as well as the royalty.  The acting was superb.  Nothing has kept my attention like this.  I would love to see more stories in this era.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|It takes a lot to scare me, I have seen all the classics, the only two to scare me were IT and The Shining (when I saw them when I was 10). I love low budget, high budget, I will watch ANYTHING in the horror genre. This movie, scared the s*** out of me and I am now 23. Disregard the snotty uptight critics. Watch this movie. The ending is slightly predictable, but the rest of the movie is great, and the ending doesn't crap out like the Paranormal Activity movie types. One of the best movies to come out in a VERY long time.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Percent awesomeness so chulo Ur gonna die I love it is alla about love in her own way love her tatto Ur gonna get a dickered just like me
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author.  I have read th e book and watched the movie.  They are both good and scary at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this game is very fun for adults and for children. Your grandparents might even enjoy this game it reminds you of temple run or angry Gran run install it and you'll love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it best app ever friend has it mom I want it on my kindle. plz it is very fun. get it now for sure
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Not as good as I thought it was going to be, but definitely an interesting movie that kept me guessing.
B005LAII80|5.0|Gritty. This movie is gritty. It reminds me of older movies like the terminator and robocop. The violence isn't watered down and it's obvious it wasn't written to sell toys. It's clearly made by people who are passionate about the source material. It has a simple plot that doesn't get in it's own way and it's a really easy movie to rewatch, either in whole or in pieces.<br /><br />It's just good old fashioned movie fun.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook on my my kindle fire is great except the fact I don't get notification  when someone posts on my wall. Great otherwise!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love the expierence of watching, reading stories, and getting<br />information from the news on the BBC. We have nothing like this in America. It is truely<br />the news from around the world. Maybe if America had this quality of journalism,our nation would not be so mean spirited.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|no sooner than i bought it my daughters watched the online copies, and when it arrived, watched the whole season within a week
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I almost returned this watch because it has a couple of cosmetic defects.  One was a small notch on the case, the other was a small hard to see blemish on the face.  The notch could have been caused as an open box, but the face it a factory issue.<br /><br />Considering this was only $60, and I didn't want to go to the hassle of returning it and hopefully getting another one without defects, I just decided to keep it.<br /><br />Now that the bad is out of the way, lets talk about the good.<br /><br />- This watch is beautiful, and the build quality surpasses the low price.<br /><br />- It's a real mechanical watch, with a crystal view caseback to view the pretty mechanicals.<br /><br />- It is accurate, especially for an automatic.  Some automatics are over 10 seconds off per day, this thing is barely off a second or two.  Very impressed!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Typical Grisham book. Fast paced with interesting twists. I really enjoyed it - once I had started, it was hard to put down.
B009RH973I|5.0|It arrived on time.  Looks good and fits great.  At Christmas it was impossible to fine an attractive cover for a Kindle Fire; everyone was getting one.  Thanks for having it in stock.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful series, great acting, good story lines, is almost a documentary of British lifestyles in those times. Will watch every episode.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book and if I talk about it I'll spoil it, so how about you read it, and then you'll be like &#34;OMFG&#34; too. :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Though I've believed in near death experiences  beforehand,<br />they are anecdotal. This was, too, but his being a brain surgeon,<br />gives it more credibility.  I know many other doctors aren't ready<br />to believe it, but read this book.  It'll make you think!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great for when you forget to charge your phone , or if you use your phone for business like I do.
B001I45UFC|5.0|this book was awesome because it is adventurous, funny and it has to to with Baptist and Jesus and how he rose from the dead. I recommend it to anyone who likes cliff hangers and adventures!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want version6 on minecraft. It has a lot of better stuff and babies cows, chickens, and pigs. Yup I saw my friend play it on her phone last week. Why can't we have the new update the same time everybody else does?
B00109T5WY|2.0|Not the sort of music I would buy again. This album is musically lacking. It is just a bunch of noise. Sorry I bought it.
1594487154|4.0|good book. very helpful. Lots of good ideas and thoughtful new ways to approach life situations. Got copies to send to family members.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome app it is so fun.except updates come in later than apple store.<br />besides that its thebest app I have on here.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday here in Chattanooga, TN as the grand finale to our 1st Annual GIG City Movie Festival.  They truly saved the best for last! I would say this movie is kind of llke a mix of \\"The Dinner Game\\" (another French comedy) & \\"The Motor Cycle Diaries\\". I laughed, we all laughed until we cried. I had no idea this was based on true life, but that made it even better! Seeing the actual men at the end caused some folks to tear up, but a different kind of tear. Placed it on pre-order, can't wait to share the love w/others & brighten their day with this masterpiece!
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I thought that this was a good movie considering I only like action/sci fi.  Maybe I just like Natalie Portman

0553382179|5.0|This book helps you see cleaning in a whole new light.  Instead of killing myself cleaning house at the last minute or all weekend long, after working all week I clean and organize in a much more orderly fashion.  5 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes is so much better than all weekend. I would recommend this to anyone who wants more out of life than cleaning house.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I recommend purchasing DVDs from Amazon. This item was a gift and my brother throughly enjoyed the show. It can be a little gruesome. It will have you on the edge of your seat, with the lights on.
B00908DDZM|4.0|It is a good CD... different style of music I think. That is what's awesome. I would recommend it to anyone.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just adding to my original review, how the heck do I download Rome version this is really hacking me off as it pops up every time I play but shows nothing as to how I can download, New York and Rio did it automatically so is this a glitch. A very good game I have been playing it a month now and am not bored, I like the changes in locations. Every time I go to put the game I have to have another game love it.

B001EC3JME|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this holster, but after looking at others, this seemed like my best bet and now that I've had it for a couple weeks, I'm glad I bought it.  The like how it can be used for a range of sizes.  The belt clip is very sturdy and well designed in my opinion.  I'm not in law enforcement or anything, but I like to keep a flashlight with me because they often come in handy.  This holster works perfectly for my needs.  I wouldn't recommend this for law enforcement because of the slight resistance in putting a flashlight back into the holster after it's removed.  I will recommend this to people who just like to keep a flashlight with them.  I would recommend getting this only for flaslights that are 5 inches or longer and with a diameter of about 1 inch. That's what seems to fit best.  Overall great purchase.
0345337581|5.0|It is the greatest book i've ever read. it boost my study efficiency. i feel much more confidence and i think i will get almost straight A's this term. i'm a international college student by the way. love it
B00000F169|3.0|Bought it for my husband, he loved it, I thought it was just ok. Real B movie, guess it was worth the price.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|I bought this for my son. He had the other ones so he wanted this one to go with it.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Forget the Stallone version. Too bad it was ever made. This is an excellent movie and I expected to dislike it
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Would not be Christmas without this movie. The song from this video starts roaming around my head shortly after Thanksgiving and won't stop until I've seen the movie a few times. I LOVE it. No words, just sweetness.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I also tried downloading the app.  It says it's downloaded but can't find it.  Receive email that purchase was made.  Tried it twice.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|Michael Cunningham's book speaks to my soul. Read immediately. It is the best book<br />ever really in the whole world
B0018LX9T4|5.0|If you're looking for a sensational whips and chains portrayal of bdsm relationships, this is not for you.  Secretary is much more complicated look at the dynamics involved involved in this kind of relationship, exploring the psychological needs these characters have and fulfill in a MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL relationship (as opposed to the very unhealthy relationships found in the 50 shades trilogy).  Also, if you've read anything of the fifty shades books, you'll find quite a few parallels with the plot of this movie.  For Pete's sake, the male leads in both are named Grey...  Note that the movie came first.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|There has to be something quite different about a 100-year old man who runs out of his own birthday party by escaping through the window of the retirement home. And indeed there is, this man having travelled over the course of his life the whole world and met all the decision makers of the 20th century, by accident in most cases. The stories, that of his past life and that of what happens after he runs away are running parallel and do not get mixed up. They are easy to follow and there is a quite nice kind of latent humour. But at the end of the day, too many unlikely events put into a same story made me loose interest. There is usually something compelling when one reads a book and know the events &#34;could&#34; happen in real life... and I lost grip with the story when it started to feel anything can just happen.<br />Still I read to the end (albeit slowly from half way through) with a half smaile on my face.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fantastic series!  I can't believe I paid for these episodes, but it was totally worth it....wish there were more to watch!
B002VISNAS|5.0|Very easy to get into, this book refers to many different type of studies and their applications to real life to make us understand where we get our first impressions from and how they can lead us astray - or not. Chosen examples are very interesting, picking into all different aspects of life (commercial, behavioural, strategical etc) and they illustrate very well how results of studies can be applied to our own life.<br />I personally liked very much the part that illustrate how too much information can be an obstacle rather than a support to make quick efficient decisions.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Greatly Sci-Fi series. Almost seems believable. Too bad the series only lasted one season. Would be nice to see a second movie made from the series.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I enjoyed reading Black Box, for the most part. It is well-written (as are all the Harry Bosch novels.) Character development is good, as always. The ending, however, (spoiler alert) is lame. The reader doesn't know why the female CID investigator just happens to show up in the nick of time to save Harry, and she refuses to say. Deus ex machina! Why not an earthquake (they are in California.) I was disappointed.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was the perfect movie to follow the short lived Firefly series. I'm a big Sci-Fi nerd and loved the movie.
0553382152|5.0|Betty's story is one of many about near death experiences.<br />She has a vivid recall of details that inspires and gives hope.
1594203334|5.0|A smart and witty personal account of one woman's adventure of raising children abroad and how it opened her eyes to new methods of parenting.  Living in NYC, I've often noticed how well mannered European children were compared to American ones, and this book offered insight as to why.  It's easy to read and you can take what you want from it - it's not a how-to manual but more of a loose guide.  Thoroughly enjoyed both her ideas and her writing and I am going to buy her next book that's due out this month.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Both my husband and I really enjoyed this book.  Suspense, adventure and John Corey's humor-great combination.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys adventure stories.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it. Very well organized, especially in tablet. I use it everyday for everything. I have never had any trouble.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I live this game very much. other friends love it too.  we compete with the time.  I would recommend this product to anyone
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was a good read but not great. The plot is a bit predictable at first but then becomes more variable.<br />The whole book reminds me of the movie- Sleeping with the Enemy. I would recommend but not highly - therefore I rated a 3.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|He ask for the Megamind movie so getting it at a good price with an bonus second movie nade it a perfect Christmas gift.

B004HD61KE|4.0|...and with a real touch of historical perspective that I had not expected. I enjoyed the read and will be back at the well for more.
B003K5UMLE|4.0|I am only writing a review to say that Catherine Tate was a terrible choice of an actress for a Dr.Who episode.  Her acting is so forced and unnatural and the sound of her voice makes me nauseous.  That being said I am a complete Dr.Who addict and I just love all the stories and adventures and the brilliant British quip.
B006LSZECO|4.0|where I was left hanging. so, color me uncomplex. I like closure. this was a very interesting story....sort of Kathleen Turner meets Missouri. and even though this was not an entirely an original plot, the writing was well crafted and the story held my interest. I kept waiting for the conclusion to shed some light on the hapless male lead's lot in life, but, alas, maybe there's a sequel. bottom line? good up to the end, then a head-scratcher. like, say what??? huh? did i get cheated out of the last 4 pages????
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it's very fun to play with my friend.<br />Have you ever wondered what it's like to be inside the game?<br />Have you been playing the game?
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|even though the Reacher series finds Jack ambling haplessly into a town....any town....and discovering the bad guy/family/enterprise, I still like the books. Reacher's drifter mode with only a toothbrush and the clothes on his back is a bit hard to conceive in the mind's eye, jack is a wonderful character. smart, flawed, hopelessly straight and honest. I'll be back to the Lee Child well for the next installment
B003O86FMW|4.0|Nice story but the twists were a tad predictable. Still the story story is engaging and creative and the book is hard to put down
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I watched this because my husband wanted to. It isn't really one of the genres I usually enjoy, but it actually was better than I expected!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's more fun than the first version of temple run.But if you loved temple run,then you will love temple run 2 . There is more action to it :)
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I don't rate Season 3 as highly as I did the previous 2 seasons. Without giving too much away, I'd say that one of the tenser story lines had a somewhat anti-climactic, hurried conclusion, another was dealt with in a more open-minded way then was probably likely for the time period, and there was a bit too much foreshadowing of the conclusion. However, this series is still better than most and I will probably continue watching them for as long as they make them. Some of the characters are absolutely wonderful, and they are all interesting in their own way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thank You all for downloading subway surfers<br />Without me knowing about this l would have<br />Been missing out on a lot of fun. I only<br />Have to get zoe and Yutami.

B005LAIGRS|4.0|Acting- A<br />Writing- A<br />Setting & Costuming- A<br />Story- A<br /><br />I don't normally watch violent movies. I think there is just way too much of it that isn't necessary to tell a good story. There was definitely a lot of it in Safe House, but when the story finally finishes up, you will see that it makes the story more meaningful. I LOVED the story. It isn't something you normally see. It's definitely NOT formulaic. Very interesting twist. The setting was fabulous. It's rare that movies are set in South Africa unless they are about apartheid or something like that. This wasn't anything like that, but the cultural piece made this far more interesting than if it had been set in Amsterdam or New York. The actors were believable. The movie has a lot to recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft on a tablet is a different experience then the Pc version. Both are great. But they are different. I want there to be a way to transfer purchases/User. Because I bought Minecraft Pocket Edition on ios, and would also like to have it on Aneroid without buying the same thing twice. Please!
B007A2O3FO|4.0|Story- A<br />Settting & Costumes- A<br />Acting- A<br /><br />I was attracted to this movie because of the cast. They didn't disappoint. They were all well chosen and did a good job. The story takes place on this odd estate with a lot of history. The house and grounds were lovely and did a good job of creating the WWII era in Britain as well as a more distant past. There are two stories here: family ties and a mystery. Both support each other and wrap up in a way that feels satisfying. If you are looking for a movie to watch with the kids, or if you are a bit of a kid yourself, you will like it. It has ghosts in it, but that's actually part of what makes it enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|No words can describe this book. When ever you read or watch something it should always leave you with a feeling. Either it being sad, angry, happy, hopeful. This book left me with all of that. Beautifully written.
0142402753|5.0|It's impossible to know what books a child will like, but our 3.5 year old daughter loved this one when she &#34;read&#34; it at a friends house, so we purchased it.  She still loves it.  It's cute, has nice pictures, and a good story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game because it changes season like Christmas and they also have this jungle them and  instead of just one person you can get coins by the game and get more  people there is so much to say about this game but get it.it so much fun

1465001123|5.0|The pictures are great. The only thing is that they are in black and white with only one thing in colour. This isn't really that bad but in some photos the coloured thing is something un-important in the background. Other than that, great purchase.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun and easy game but it ducks when you run out of diamonds and energy because every thing is so expensive

B002AF4Y96|5.0|I have had more fun over the years with this film than almost any other film ever.A mainstay of my collection since day one but justcause I can probably recite the movie from memory I still needed to have it on blu ray for those special fun nights
1439156816|5.0|This book is an example on conversational storytelling by one of the best storytellers of our time. Stephen's book is an example of his craft. I will not reduplicate what most have said. I use this, and several of Stephen's other books, to study his style of writing, his wording and description, how he draws me in...and how he makes his character's come to life. I was most interested in the second half of the book...which talks about HIS reflections and advise on how to be a writer.<br /><br />I started the book at the back, after reading the beginnning of the book. After going through the suggested reading and his most recent reading list, I got right into the story of his 1999 MVA -- an example of a story crafted well. However many of your saw flashes of what was going on and the characters while you read it? I did.<br /><br />Whatever you do in your writing career, learning to tell a story is at the foundation of the craft. Study Stephen's writings to learn how to tell a better story.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book, Mr. King!<br />I appreciate you.

0439023491|5.0|After the Harry Potter series I discovered that just because I belong to AARP doesn't mean I can't enjoy books written for young readers. I found the Hunger Games to be an engaging moral tale of a dysfuntional world that says volumes about the world in which we live. It reminded me of works like &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land.&#34;

B0011UJMK2|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book especially since I had spent months reading memoirs of Lenin, Stalin, and Trotsky.  The author based much of the story and action on facts.  I thought the characters were well-developed.  I always read more that I planned as I wanted to see what happened next - always a good thing.  Smith put a lot of history into the book which is one of my favorite parts of reading good fiction.  I plan to read the other two books in this series at some point.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found this to be one of his best books in years.  It held my interest, and I couldn't wait for the end; which was a surprise.  That doesn't happen often.  I loved the Racketeer.

B00A77II0U|4.0|Great Alware game as usual but I finished it in just over 2 hours. Not much game but still worth the 2.99 I paid for it.
1451695195|4.0|I had high hopes for this book, and although the science was insightful, I still didn't feel as though there was a lot of conviction to his story. Tales such as this are always taken with a grain of salt, but his scientific background makes it interesting. I think I had such high expectations that I would have been dissatisfied regardless of the content. I felt the same about 50 Shades of Grey and everyone loved that book. For a great read I suggest Taking Charge with Value Investing. I am just finishing it and feel very encouraged and enlightened. The book is written as a story but can help people understand investments in a time when the market looks to be going up. I enjoy novels but this book is full of psychological information and tips to help you make better decisions[[ASIN:0071804684 Taking Charge with Value Investing: How to Choose the Best Investments According to Price, Performance, & Valuation to Build a Winning Portfolio]]

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins' ability to write it almost like a screenplay and keep the reader's attention during shifts in the story is incredible. This is probably my favorite series. If you haven't read the book then you should, regardless if you've seen the movie
B000O8OTNC|5.0|i had another small sharpener but it lacked one major component, the diamond rod. keep and edge on your serrated blades, or file just about anything, you can really take off a lot of metal with one of these, and sense its tapered it also works great for jamming into a tight knot to help you get it untied the sharpener for course blades is great for a blade with knicks in it, or has never really had an edge, or i like to use it on my machete to keep it sharp. then you have the ceramic sharpener, for your fine blades, kitchen knifes to keep a serious edge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a wonderfully written book.  it opened my eyes as to how some people live.  But credit for the stronger  person.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this as a gift so I couldn't open it at the time but the recipient was very happy with the presentation of the box and the new on disk interactive menus, not to mention the content itself. Something every sci-fi or horror enthusiast should have in their movie collection for sure.
B009ZUKY52|4.0|Took this controller out of the box and plugged it into my Mac.  I use Garage Band and Reason 6 software.  I plugged in the USB cable, turned it on and started making music.  Keys feel good.  Just the right amount of resistance that lets you really pound on it if you so need or a soft touch if inspiration requires it.  Controls are well placed and respond well when adjusted.  I did not attempt to install the Ignite software since I already have some great software.  If you're just starting out in recording and making computer based music this is a great little controller for a decent price.
0062082353|1.0|this guy ultimately got what he deserved for killing scores of people who he had no business being near in the first place.  shooting people who had no military training, were not in the army, but just acting as they thought in their country's best interest. there's no skill in murdering basically civilian-skilled people in their own lands.  that's cowardly, and chris, hope you meet those you shot without mercy and they tell you how badly you messed up.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Time travel movies require a certain amount of acceptance on the part of the viewer. Paradoxes abound, and to paraphrase one of the characters in the movie, thinking too much about it will turn your brain into a fried egg. Once you stop worrying about the contradictions of time travel, this is a well-made, enjoyable film that has elements of &#34;Terminator&#34; , &#34;12 Monkeys&#34; and &#34;the Walking Dead&#34; to name a few. The performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, are solid. There are some dead spots in the middle, but overall it's very good film.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show! It's so different. I love the way each season is independent if each other.  Jessica Lange is wonderful. Sarah Paulson really had a great role as Lana and her stand off with Dylan McDermott was so good. I can't believe how I was actually feeling sorry for him. If this show was a movie, it would sweep the Oscars, in my opinion.  I know it's going to sweep the Emmys again.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The setting reminds me a lot of Blade Runner (another Phillip K. Dick-inspired film).  The original Total Recall will always be a classic, but this one, in my opinion, IS worth seeing.  From the trailers, I felt the opposite way.  After giving it a chance, I felt like it had great pacing, great ideas, and was a lot of fun with very good acting.<br /><br />And above all, the small but significant changes to the plot (making it closer to the original PKD story) really worked, and made the film not merely a remake, but somewhat of a new film unto itself as well.  Great job.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's overall a great game I have it on my iPod definitely 5 stars but on my kindle whenever I download it the controls go all weird and sensitive and makes it almost impossible to control. It also makes my whole kindle like that so I have to delete it and reset.my whole kindle
B005FISBTO|5.0|Great season of dexter in a compact design.  I love the slim line disc holders they use and nice presentation boxers.  If you love Dexter there is nothing more to say.  If you are new to the show and trying to catch up, watch the first five seasons first.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|it kept your interest on every page there was always a new twist.  it goes to show anything can be fulled if you only want it bad enough.
B001RT89TC|4.0|Assault Attack (1982), the third studio album by the Michael Schenker Group (MSG), was the first and last to feature former Rainbow vocalist Graham Bonnet.  Although Bonnet's tenure with the band was brief, and came to a fiery conclusion, infused with some inspired guitar playing from Michael Schenker, and Bonnet's singing and songwriting contributions, the Martin Birch (Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath) produced album, is actually one of the stronger MSG efforts during the 1980's.  The personnel involved on the album included Schenker on guitar, Chris Glenn on bass, and new MSG members drummer Ted McKenna (Rory Gallagher), keyboard player Tommy Eyre, and Bonnet.<br /><br />What actually happened may be up for discussion, but after recording the album and as the band was preparing to tour, Bonnet abruptly departed, which led to former singer Gary Barden rejoining MSG.  Apparently replacing Bonnet's vocals with Barden's was considered, but fortunately Assault Attack was eventually released with Bonnet's original vocals.  This was definitely for the best, as Bonnet was a major contributor to the songwriting, and his voice is clearly much better suited to the material.<br /><br />Although things may have ended badly, the music on this album rocks very solidly, as Birch helps give the band a broader and more dynamic sound.  Schenker's guitar tone is warmer and fuller, and his leads seem to pack more energy.  Bonnet totally delivers, putting great effort into his singing, which along with Schenker's contributions, helps to give the music impact, and the energy to bolster the weaker material.<br /><br />As a UFO fan, I had been following MSG for a few years, however when I bought the album on vinyl in the early 80's, I had no clue that Bonnet had already exited the band.  I just dug the music a lot, as Michael's playing seemed to really come alive on this album, and Bonnet's singing was voice was a nice fit.  \\"Rock You To The Ground\\", \\"Desert Song\\", \\"Ulcer\\", and \\"Assault Attack\\" were my favorite tracks.  \\"Broken Promises\\", \\"Samurai\\", and \\"Searching For a Reason\\" are also good solid songs.  \\"Dancer\\", with Bonnet's straining vocals, is just a little too commercial for my tastes, however Bonnet is in fine form in the bonus track \\"Girl From Uptown\\".<br /><br />Looking to take Rainbow in a different direction, Ritchie Blackmore brought Graham Bonnet out of relative obscurity, to replace the iconic Ronnie James Dio.  Although a complete neophyte to hard rock, with a back ground mostly in soul and R&B, Bonnet was a quick learner, and did some really interesting things on Rainbow's [[ASIN:B004RLNZ7S Down To Earth]] (1979) album, bringing some commercial appeal, and a bluesier flavor to the band.  Although Rainbow had a hit with Russ Ballard's \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", Bonnet supposedly got bored, and left Rainbow.  Later, MSG's drummer Cozy Powell, who played with Bonnet in Rainbow, recruited him for Schenker's band.<br /><br />The only really fast tune on Assault Attack is the instrumental \\"Ulcer\\", the rest of the songs are on the slower side, seemingly geared down to suit Bonnet's singing style.  Schenker doesn't have many blistering fast solo runs, but even so, Assault Attack still contains some very tasteful playing, and classics like \\"Desert Song\\" and \\"Rock You To the Ground\\".<br /><br />Assault Attack provided an opportunity for Michael Schenker to stretch out and do some different things.  Unfortunately, changing vocalists would soon become a reoccurring event for him.  After MSG, Bonnet would join Alcatrazz, where he would eventually collaborate with guitarists Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, and Danny Johnson.  Although the Bonnet's time in MSG was brief, a damn good album came from it.\\" were my favorite tracks.  \\"Broken Promises\\", \\"Samurai\\", and \\"Searching For a Reason\\" are also good solid songs.  \\"Dancer\\", with Bonnet's straining vocals, is just a little too commercial for my tastes, however Bonnet is in fine form in the bonus track \\"Girl From Uptown\\".<br /><br />Looking to take Rainbow in a different direction, Ritchie Blackmore brought Graham Bonnet out of relative obscurity, to replace the iconic Ronnie James Dio.
