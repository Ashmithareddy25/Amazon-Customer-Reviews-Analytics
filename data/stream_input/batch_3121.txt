B00B5HQL50|5.0|This Bond movie was balanced quite nicely.  Sure, some of the premises strain credulity, but that's the price of admission. The action was intense but restrained. And it was not nonstop, which was a well-deserved criticism of a recent outing.<br /><br />Speaking of outing, well, there's a scene...<br /><br />But keeping up tradition, there was of course a Bond girl.  This was one was possibly my all-time favorite!<br /><br />The Q character is back with a new name, a new generation, and a new take on technology.  And another character reaches a milestone.<br /><br />Go see it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who has concerns about our current administration. The author did an incredible job relating the stories of everyday North Korean citizens who defected to South Korea. As an American citizen, we should be concerned about how problematic it can be if Government takes control of our every day decision making process.  Propaganda is everywhere, including present day United States.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is brilliant.  The Goldfinch is the best novel I've read since The Secret History.  It is right up there with The Count of Monte Cristo, To Kill a Mockingbird and Gone With the Wind!
B0094M2GNE|4.0|This is a great, mindless movie that's just plain fun. Aliens attacking London to be fended off by a group of teenage hoodlums - what more could you want?
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As usual a great Grisham read!! Holds your attention and I like the Jake Brigance character! Can't wait until the next book!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We aren't able to watch this on television every week so the<br />dvd allows us to keep up with the show.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read all John Grisham's books and they just get better. The story is so real it was hard to put the book down.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|My husband loves this series and it was a gift for him.<br />He was thrilled with the dvd and was very happy with<br />the gift.

B000W9EOEC|5.0|Seriously one of the greatest live mixes. I love everything that daft punk puts out.  I already have this album, but i wanted to get my friend a copy for his car, because he loves daft punk too.

B003H6KRIE|4.0|A gift to a relative.  The price was so good that i couldn't really care less about what features were included or whatever.  My relative says that they are decent though and loves the commentary.
B00DOHLFZK|5.0|I love this movie and now I love the book.  Very long, but worth it.  The story line is same as book.  A must read.
B007DIQC90|4.0|Great album.  I bought it before they went big on the radio and i think they are a decent band.  They won't amaze you, but its just good thoughtless car music.  Something to cycle in while you are waiting for the next thing from a favorite artist.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved this book.  I bought it after Kyle's passing.  It's a painfully honest look at what people and their families go through to help keep us safe here in the US.
B0091REZMW|2.0|You stayed in the same rooms too long and basically had to find the same items over and over again.  Not fun for me.  I deleted the game.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is one of the best FREE photo editing program that hasn't crashed or froze. I would and did give this a five stat rating. Will be sharing this site for anyone with a kindle fire hd!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|my grandaughter ordered this by herself and it keeps her busy for hours. it plays well and boots up quickly but does not take alot of space.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|When you sit don you watch this movie you have to understand what to expect. The reason I gave it 5 stars is not due to its artistic quality or deep intricate plot. This is a straightforward, raunchy, roll on the floor laughing comedy, and it delivers in those areas with proficiency that few movies show nowadays.<br /><br />The cast that plays the Millers does an outstanding job in their roles. Jennifer Aniston is as good as she was in Friends, Jason Sudeikis proves that he deserves a place among the top guys in the genre today, with his perfect use of facial expressions and his switching between low-level drug dealer and family man. Probably the revelation is the kid that plays Kenny, his freshness and the naivete he provides his character promise great things to come from him.<br /><br />The script is as funny as funny can be. There is a nice blend of straightforward humor, with raunchy situations, providing everyone with a little of what they like. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh almost non-stop and that will leave you feeling good and refreshed when you are done, look no further.
B004UID2LC|4.0|my grandaughter ordered this by herself and it keeps her busy for hours. it plays well and boots up quickly but does not take alot of space.
B004NEY9EW|3.0|Let me start by saying that I consider Sean Connery the best Bond, but among everyone else that has played this role Daniel Craig is in my mind a clear second. In this movie, Craig does a fine job, but I found the script a little bit of a mess. The action starts right after the end of Casino Royale, and we are thrown into the middle of an action packed sequence that is hard to follow. Not only because we don't really know what is going on, but also because the way in which the action scene is presented is too frenetic and it's hard to even see who is who in many instances and determine what is actually happening.<br /><br />I like action movies, but it annoys me when in an effort to make the action super high pace, the directors go over the top and we end up with meaningless sequences of events. Luckily for this film, once those initial moments pass, things get better. There is actually an interesting plot in place, with Bond suffering from the loss of  loved one and walking the thin line between going rogue and doing his job. As usual, there is suspense and intrigue, mixed with action and romance.<br /><br />This film is definitely not boring, but it is lacking some of those distinctive traits I have come to love in Bond movies, such as the off the cuff humor. Overall I was entertained, but it it not a Bond movie that will come to mind if someone has never watch a film with this character and asks me for advice on which one to try.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was really excited for this book to come out, but I found it very confusing to follow when the author kept switching characters point of view.  It wasn't,to until half way through the book that I could tell which character was telling the story.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I was hesitant to download this game, because it looks a bit odd, but I must say it's superb!! Very fun game for adults and children, worth a download!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Doesn't work on my kindle....memory storage not large enough...should be in bold letters before purchase...wasted money on this, very unhappy....
B00G32OER4|2.0|Although I thought it had potential in the beginning, it was very typical in storyline and rather uninteresting and anti climactic in my opinion.  Although, to see it as just another 'scary movie' it wasn't all that bad.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|lots of fun.  Some are easy, some are very challenging.  The box gets bigger with every new level. I play it to pass the time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It would be nice if this worked with more than 6 apps - if you want to watch Amazon Prime don't plan on using Google Chromecast.  If I can't find any info on a software update that expands the use I'm going to return it.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Movie is OK, but it is just another disaster movie.  Nothing special here.  Just move along.  I need four more
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Right from the beginning we were engrossed. Never a dull moment. Unique plot. Lots of surprises. Great cast. Don't miss this one!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|With my Google Chromecast and my portable projector from Brookstone, I'm a walking movie projector! I no longer have a TV. Why should you let a TV restrain you and hold you back from living? If I want to watch something in the bathroom, that is my prerogative!<br /><br />My favorite thing about the Chromecast is when a group of my friends are around - we take turns putting up youtube videos we need to watch. We take out our android phones and send them to Google Chromecast. It's awesome!<br /><br />I use Plex Media Player to project my movies that are saved on my computer, and I use my phone to project movies from Netflix.<br /><br />The only problem is that sometimes, videos get a little choppy. I wonder if that's a bandwidth issue though.
B0088NCE3W|5.0|Mr. Dalrymple manages to convey and deftly balance vast erudition with an unpretentious narrative style and wry humor.  He is also inspired with a talent for selecting fascinating subjects to write about.

B00EL6ACOI|3.0|This was a disappointing purchase since it was exactly the same as what was shown on TV for weeks prior to its release for FREE!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a well written book and it really makes you think about what you would do as a parent.
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|This app is wonderful and is addicting. I love the way it teaches you how to play. I love the different scenarios they have per-programmed so you can learn.
031623480X|5.0|Reiterates what a lot of other recent books have to say on our hazardous diets in this country.  As a patient with Celiac, I wish that some of these books had come out sooner, but at least people are becoming more conscious of the dangers of wheat and sugar.<br />This book presents a good synopsis of the issues.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it LOVE it LOVE IT so addicting tho I have been waiting to get it on my kindle fire HD forever
B00DHQI2QS|5.0|Awesome series!!<br />I love all programing having to do with attorneys, lawfirms, litigations.<br />I like watching multiple episodes in a row, so I wait until the entire season is released.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This documentary is historically significant, historically accurate and educational.  Excellent acting and unforgettable scenes.  Recommend this to all adult audiences.
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|It's Nemo how can you NOT like it!<br /><br />I have always loved this movie and watched it with my 5mth old as many times as the rental would allow!
B00GBCMW9S|3.0|Doesn't bump quite like the old Eminem from the late 90's and 00's.  A majority of this album is more like battle rap.
B000ID1IYG|2.0|watched this movie when i was younger and decided to watch it again... as a kid i had no idea how cheesy this movie really is!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It was the perfect protection for my Kindle Fire. It's not flashy or fancy but quite functional. I would buy it again.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|fun movie to watch, with many hidden jems to uncover each time I watch it - lots of detail in all of the backgrounds that take watching a number of times to uncover.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Best read I've experienced in a long time.  You get very caught up in the life of this very interesting man.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This author at his best. It was great to catch up with Jake and family. Another unbelievable legal drama in Ford County. Filled with twists and turn that the reader could not see coming. Just when you think you have it figured out - watch out the plot will blindside you. More sequels please!
B00ESF2772|5.0|My grandchildren were delighted to find the book on my Kindle apps in full color on my I-Pad and black and white on my Paperwhite.
B00FOQRNN2|5.0|Very good guide to build the store in which you can buy book like this one day before the release date and get it for the lowest price. It also write much about Jeff's frugality. Best parts describe how long term vision can help growth.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|This movie is a Classic for all generations of today.  A must see if you have never seen Zoolander before
0062020897|5.0|This is an older Ken Follett novel but just as exciting as the ones I read before and after this publication.  It keeps you on your toes.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Awesome set! All of the early Star Trek movies in one set! Bought two sets for Christmas gifts. Can't wait to give them...
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss's first book is an incredible journey that leaves the reader yearning for more. The character development is superb and the story compelling. If you've never read this new exciting author, treat yourself to an epic tale of Kvothe, The Bloodless, that will keep you turning the pages until you look up and it's 5 AM and it's time to go to work... It's that good.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Great 80s flashback movie! and great soundtrack too! also check out despretely seeking susan too! I owned the soundtrack to whos that girl on cassette back when it first came out but never saw the movie until i purchased it now....soo glad i can now say ive seen the movie.
B00628SJJS|5.0|This movie will make you smile and cry.  To explain the holocaust to a child is almost as much of a task as comtemplating the occurance itself.  The actors in this movie play a phenomenal role in proividing evidence that kinship can surpass prejudice.  A true awakening to understanding the innocence of a child and how open their hearts can be.  Heart-felt happiness because of the bond made but true sadness because of the tragic climax.  If one cannot justify actions to a child, the actions are likely unjustifiable.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A challenge to not put this game down, one you start it draws you in for hours of fun enjoyment!
1467934925|4.0|The most influential economist of the twentieth century wrote that the state should actively participate in the economic activity of a country. It was to be an investor. In fact this policy, state intervention was applied to reduce the effects of the 1929 depression. Also to help the economic recovery of Europe after the Second World War. A state regulator of the economy. These ideas have fallen into disuse now been relegated to a spectator: neoliberalism. Keynes is interesting to read in their own words.
0545265355|5.0|CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Encore was so horrible that I kind of lost interest in Eminem after that. After listening to Relapse and Recovery though I was like \\"oh okay, he didn't lose it.\\" To be honest after buying this album I was a little skeptical as to how good it was really going to be but right off the bat it was lyrically some of the best stuff I've heard from anybody in a long time. I was glad to hear that he wasn't doing that screaming/yelling rap voice he has been doing a lot of in his more recent work, and glad that he got other people to sing his choruses for him (most of them I mean) instead of singing them himself. I feel like on this album Eminem was spitting that type of flow he used in his first main stream records the Slim Shady LP and the Marshall Mathers LP but times 10. Really he is an amazing rapper as far as what he is doing lyrically - I don't hear anybody young or old spit complex/hilarious/understandable/relatable rhymes like that or even have the slightest ability to rap like that. He has set the bar very high for everybody in the rap game and being that he is in his 40's, he is one of the older rappers out there that still rap that is actually getting better at his craft.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this book. I hated to see the series end. My reaction at finishing this book, &#34;I died that day!&#34;
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Such a great ending to a great trilogy! To me these books were much better than the Hunger Games<br />P.S. You will cry
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Can't put it down!  I knew I should have waited to start it when I had more time to read.

B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|It was one of the most boring books I have ever read, and the ending was weird. I kept thinking that more was going to happen, but it never did.
B0094AH3F2|2.0|Unfortunately this is not Tebaldi, nor is it Price.  This Leonora has a strong wobble on the high notes; the voice is rather unpleasant lacking the warmth of the 2 ladies already mentioned.  The rest of the cast is serviceable. One misses a Siepi as Guardiano.  On the whole a performance to be bypassed. Sorry.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|What an Album here , He has through everything together and come up with another Gem every track a gem
B000001GQR|5.0|I grew up with the notion that one can really appreciate a composition by hearing two entirely different approaches to the music: Toscanini and the current performance by Furtwangler.  Each has something to say about this masterwork; and each is a solid statement therein.  Toscanini propulsive and exciting, while Furtwangler is the other side of the coin, much more deliberate and deeply probing of the subtile nuances in Schuberts Symphony.  Furtwangler discovers a world of passion and intellect here and gives a reading that should be in any serious record library.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|This is a good album but she has proved to her self she can do better ,a breath of fresh air
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Engaging and interesting story which opened my eyes to the dark reality of life in North Korea.  Great storytelling which held my interest.

B004LQJPEG|5.0|I was in NYC in 1973.  I love how this movie captures the grit, the noise and the feel of the city from that time.  The soundtrack is edgy, haunting and almost disconcordant, but its a perfect match. Great performances especially when you consider the director didn't want Hackman or the Spanish actor who plays the Frenchman.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The graphic are very good. Game play starts off slow but is definitely worth playing if hunting is your thing.
B004IFD9HE|5.0|This is a great movie for adults and older kids. There is some cursing, but the movie breezes over it pretty fast. Could have been made without it of course. The characters are really funny and it is great for kids imagination.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|Nice graphics and if you have surround sound it's awesome. good story line also. Father and son are great together.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I love David Tennant in everything that he does.<br />really like the scruffy look make him look even sexier if that's possible

B005GIS1WA|5.0|Rio was definitely an adorable movie, it was family friendly but had just a touch of 'grown up' humor to make it entertaining!  As the owner of a parrot I feel the main characters were well researched and portrayed fairly accurately as far as a G rated film.  Our family really enjoyed it!
B004H0M8EA|5.0|Read this and know what we have in store for our own extinction which seems to be inevitable. Though it will take a long time, it is sure to happen.
030759565X|3.0|I'm not sure why I bought this, thought I would love it.  I've read through the whole book and not sure it fits my style.  Now I could be wrong and will give it some more thought and try more recipes and review after 6 months.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I waited a while to get this on my kindle.  He is certainly a fascinating person/character.  It would have been incredible to sit down with this genius and just converse with him (or maybe not !)  He truly was ahead of his time and I'm glad I finally took the plunge and bought the kindle edition of this book.  IF it's pretty true to the whole story, he was one mean, evil, heartless, confident, loving and self centered person who at times could show you his otherside.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|Only the Blu-ray is UNRATED. The DVD and Digital are theatrical release ONLY!!!<br />.<br />I loved the movie and would've given 5-stars, but Paramount corn-holes the customer with the packaging of the  [UNRATED] version.<br />.<br />I just HATE that the DVD and Digital are not the UNRATED version.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Gotta love a guy who flies RIGHT?  I really like the movie and I'm from the generation that has seen a few of these and my mother was crazy about Steve Reeves the original flyboy!  Great movie and would watch it again and again.

B0029LCJJS|4.0|Warning the first episode has a lot of sex and doesnt really have much after. The history of him begins in the third or fourth episode
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini just gets better and better. Rather than focusing on a single, star-crossed protagonist, Hosseini skillfully and almost literally weaves a tale of various people whose lives somehow start or are touched by a single Afghan village. If you liked his first two, you'll love this one. If you always wanted to read the first two but were intimidated by the length or seemingly depressing subject matter, go ahead and give this one a shot. It's a quick and page-turning read, but throughout the characters are distinct, interesting, well-fleshed-out and, in many instances, surprising.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a book that is both dark and full of light at the same time. I felt that I had discovered a friend and didn't want to let him go. Great book, and full of good lessons along the way.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I liked the movie overall and I've read the book series, but I am left to wonder at how the middle books are going to carry the story forward on the big screen.  With that being said, the acting and cinematography were both good and the story is worth watching.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good story but I figured out the ending halfway through the book.  I enjoyed reading it.  More like the original books.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Even I am not an English speaking native, the Handbook is very easy to follow through with very good examples. We apply the model in the company that I work and was very useful. Thanks
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Fans of Divergent will appreciate the closure this novel brings. Roth does move the story forward, and readers will get to experience the world outside of the gates. Unfortunately, both the love story and the world beyond Chicago don't ever feel fully formed. The characters do what you expect of them, and the ending feels unnecessary. I enjoyed time with these characters, but this series ended more with a fizzle than a bang.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great book. Not one of Steve's absolute best but definitely in the pack with his &#34;eminently enjoyable&#34; reads. He does a good job of following up The Shining with believable continuations of the characters. The story is entirely different, with this following more of a suspenseful, redemption-focused story instead of being pure horror, but it doesn't lose anything as a result. In fact, going the horror route would've been a mistake as it would've invited closer comparisons to The Shining, which would not have ended well for The Doctor!
B0001US62I|5.0|\\"Angel Heart\\" is directed by Alan Parker who also directed \\"Shoot the Moon\\", \\"Midnight Express\\", and \\"Birdy\\". This tale of the selling of one's soul to the devil is magnificently directed and is comparable to an Alfred Hitchcock or Coppola film for its quality of direction. I can't say enough about how great the direction and musical/sound choices are in this film. It's a film that also seems to get just get better and better upon multiple viewings. The acting is also superb from Robert DeNiro, Charlotte Rampling, Mickey Rourke, to Lisa Bonet and an amazing cast of extras.<br /><br />The special edition has many extras with discussions with Alan Parker to Mickey Rourke to documentaries about Voodoo. Evidently this dvd has extras that even the recently released blu-ray doesn't have so it might be worth getting just for that reason. The video quality is excellent as it has been remastered, but it still does show instances of dust.

B003BV8I3Q|1.0|As a white man,I have tons of respect for the late great Martin Luther King Jr.He was all about peace and unity.His dream was to bring ALL RACES together as ONE...which is a beautiful and wonderful thing. RIP Dr.King. ...Malcolm X on the other hand was nothing more than a black nazi,as far as I'm concerned.He promoted and taught complete segregation between the races.No difference in the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party's teachings.He encouraged blacks around the world to hate the \\"white devil\\",while Dr.King taught that love would overcome hate.This is why Malcolm X(real name Malcolm Little) hated Martin Luther King Jr so much.Little labeled him as an \\"Uncle Tom\\",because of his views.Such arrogance!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Highly recommended.<br />The app is working fine and I have already bought 4 Kindle books by one of my favorite authors, Alexander McCall Smith and am enjoying reading them on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I always used to have a wistful feeling when looking at Amazon.com books that were available in digital form, as we were unlikely to buy a device that was just for e-books, but not any more, thanks to this app.<br /><br />I like the fact that if my tablet gets too full of e books from Amazon, I can always remove them and they will be there in the cloud waiting for me to download them again. There are other nice features of this app, which people with Kindles must already know, such as being able to choose pages with a slight beige tint to them--very restful to my eyes.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This is a lovely story for children. However, I would rate it as needing parental guidance. There is too much graphic display of violence and death. It has gotten good reviews by young family members as well as mature adults I so I think many people will enjoy the dramatization of the story.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Fascinating and beautiful, informative, and I can watch them repeatedly. Sometimes when I'm reading or concentrating on other things, I'll play them on mute just to have the beautiful scenery in HD ;-)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Mesmerizing story kept me turning the pages! I applaud Grisham for being so consistent. This is a must re ad!
B0059DQHHI|4.0|an arresting, intimate-- most scenes have just two characters-- drama involving the lengths we go to in order to love and sustain our love, whether husband, wife, child, abandoned ad adopted alike.  Sensitively acted, this film is marred only by some soap opera contrivances.  One other thought: the movie makes you wonder about the validity of first impressions-- your sympathies may change as the plot unfolds.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|It's Lady Antebellum. It's awesome just like all of their other CDs. Not much more to say, they nailed it, as usual.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|It doesn't work at all on the kindle. Not sure why it is even available to download. Very disappointed with this.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Distinguished voice, great song writing, and I do not know why it took me so long to discover this music artist gem.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Loved going back to watch the first season. Especially on my Kindle Fire the quality is top notch. The sound and picture are great. I can watch the whole episode or just a little and go back to where I left off. Love the extra features!
0955153077|5.0|This book is an excellent starting point for any artist starting with digital painting using Photoshop. Very well written and illustrated. Great buy!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|My husband loves this show and is enjoying is on our kindle. Once he is done, I will begin watching it.
B007PBL9KC|5.0|love it! just loved it; one of the best albums i listened to in a long time; warmly recommended if you're into that kind of genre
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love the idea that there is a lot of games and books that you can get for the kindle
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|His clear and precise explanation leads to only one conclusion; the basis for decisions by the religious group are based on their invention of supporting &#34;facts&#34; which are not backed by evidence.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|I was raised in the church of Jim Henson. The people who made this were, too, and it is less an old fashioned Muppet movie than it is a happy, Muppet elegy. Songs are outstanding.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Constantly says Internet not connected but all other search sites work . Google just recently started doing this to me.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy working these puzzles. They can be quite difficult and I like that. Haven't decides whether I'm going to buy the app yet but if I do, I think it will be worth it.
0812550706|4.0|I had a hard time accepting children behaving as adults. That aside, it was an excellent  read. I am looking forward to the sequels
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Wonderful and exciting keeps your mind sharp.plenty of fun. Great for family would recommend for everyone ruling and old alike
B007US9NA8|5.0|Thorough breakdown of EVERYTHING!! Thus us the best basic understanding of weightlifting and HOW to do it. Like having your own personal trainer.
B005R32L66|5.0|Our daughter is in London for the school year, and we Skype once or twice a week.  Great.  Just make sure a computer is on with the  volume up so you can hear the burble that signals an incoming call.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic read that brings up a lot of social questions that every young person should at one time or another have a think about. Catches you early and gives the reader a lot of character development. I will be trading this book again and sharing with my kids when they come of age.
B009LDD22U|5.0|We've been big fans of Big Bang since day one.  Sometimes they seem to get off track for a couple of episodes, but always manage to get their act together.  It is on of the few sitcoms that hasn't dumbed the characters down to morons as time has gone by (although they keep pointing Raj in that direction).  Personally, Id be ok with a DVD for something like this, but my wife and daughter prefer Blu-ray for everything.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|liked the movie and was great to see old Arnie back in the saddle again - funny and stupid but I enjoyed the action
B00DJWV11I|5.0|It was awesome! I really love the male point of view. It was funny and touching, I would read it again.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|&#34;Now You See Me&#34; had an Oceans 11 vibe throughout.  Four well known magicians come together to pull off an elaborate plot to steal money from the rich and give to, well, whomever can make it out to their shows.  Their reasoning? Just to show they can and so that they can join a super exclusive magic club called The Eye.  While the plot was a bit unbelievable and groan worthy at times the performances turned in by the cast were very good and their dynamic created a lot of funny moments throughout.  The special effects used in the film for the magic were also very cool and kept me engaged.  As twisty and turny as the plot was in the movie, you could probably guess what the twist is going to be at the end of the movie.  There aren't a lot of obvious clues pointing to the twist but if you've seen one of these movies you've seen 'em all and thus you probably won't end up too surprised.<br /><br />I give this movie 3/5.  It's a fun rental but ultimately a movie that you won't remember in another year or two.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|gogbyo high very fast. next thing I know I'm stuck and buy. 99 at a time. $20 dollars later I'm still playing. Even contact with friends on facebook to Greg more lives!  Beware. its not really free after all.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|This is a great album, different than other Arcade Fire albums. It has a retro disco rock sound to it. If you listen to David Bowie or the Cars or later Pink Floyd (late 70s/80s) you might love this. Also has a touch of some newer bands like MGMT, Modest Mouse, LCD Soundsystem, and Fun. I know these comparisons aren't fair. The soundscape is technically diverse, you can't really label this band anything other than itself. You can tell the strong nuances of the vocals reflect in each song. This album is so bold and daring it may change the sound of pop music forever. This album is so deep and full of meaning it may change some people's lives. Some will find it pretentious or too different from old arcade fire to like. Give it a good 5 listens before you truely judge.<br /><br />Also people in the realm of Obama, farmers markets, shopping vintage, buying vinyl, eating local, driving Prius, reading lots of intellectual literature books, conceptual fine art, coffee and cigarettes, anti mainstream, loving retro, college, wearing thick framed glasses/tight pants, indie films and music, Wes Anderson, critical thinking, camping/floating/hiking, dressing up like Ryan Gosling, poetry, shopping moms and pops shops, pacifism, live rock shows will love this Arcade Fire album. People who hate being labeled Hipsters will vote on \\"no\\" this review was not helpful. Others will vote yes.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|Surely no one needs an Amazon rating to know what &#34;The Wall&#34; is, and why it is a fabulous album. It is great.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|Very complex and compelling read. Really gets the brain going to follow the amazing story lines. Very well researched as well.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Beautiful graphics, puzzles make one think. The concept/story line of the lost city was more interesting.  Not crazy about the sorceress. Still worth the price and the time.
B00006LLOG|5.0|What a fabulous album, what a great artist. The first time I heard Walk on the Wild Side I felt set free in a certain way. I was on the West Coast, longing for the East Coast, New York City, and that freedom. It was the first song I ever heard that addressed the existence of sex beyond hetero, that made weirdness so cool, and defined true hip. I still love it, love the album that is every bit as wonderful today as then, he was so out there and ahead of his time -- Rap and Hip Hop owe him a lot. Lou Reed's voice is so warm, his lyrics nail it every time -- simple and true - and I am sorry he's gone but am thankful for his music and poetry. When I heard a few years ago that he and Laurie Anderson were married, I thought &#34;there's a marriage made in heaven&#34; - what an ideal union. Anyway, thank you Lou Reed. RIP
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Incredible. Beautiful graphics for all four sessions. Interesting puzzles.  I like the variety of puzzles Fire Maple Games incorporates in their games. Great price.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|finally a Brad Pitt movie that I didn't feel creeped out at the end by all the violence and bizarreness. This movie is kind of fun and BP is good in it. There are a couple of movies he's done that I have enjoyed, A River Runs Through It, the one with Cate Blanchett, Thelma and Louise, the one where he plays death, the Oceans movies. But he's done some  violent, icky, twisted movies that have no redeeming value except to feed a fascination with the grotesque. Zombie movies I think are really relevant social commentary and this one is good. Yes they are bizarre, but in a good way. Lol.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Only begin this book when you the time...because you won't be able to put it down. Memorable.  Profound. Heartbreaking. Worth re-reading.  A keeper.
B00DGNOMB6|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this but maybe it was my mood, it was a bit depressing to me and just slow. Sorry Dustin, Maggie, everybody.
B005IS565S|5.0|FFDP rocks. My son was able to use &#34;The Pride&#34; in a homework assignment. We own all of FFDP and have not been disappointed.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|This was a great movie, the way it evolved and the turns it takes made it real interesting and plenty action.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV.  I have been a fan since season 1 and hope to still be a fan for many seasons to come. You know a show is good when you are willing to DVR continual reruns of past seasons every morning on TNT.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|The sg1, atlantis anf sgu continues to be my all time favorite. Wish they came came with something else. Awesome!
B005LAII9O|4.0|Good action and the story line is awesome. Great acting and I just love Salma! The in n out dreams are excellent. A must have dvd!
B002SRQ214|4.0|one hell of a processor.  good bang for buck, but boggs down a little on the most demanding of tasks
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really like how this game is made I love reel steal I love having to fight with robots as well. I hope whoever gets this game that they would enjoy it
B0023S50DO|5.0|This movies is so good! It has everything suspense, drama, love story, and the end of the world.  Likeable character, it just engages you and is believable.  It is one of my favorite disaster movies.  Very good cast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun and good brain exercise. Love this game. Sometimes strategies are even a water cooler topic! Love the progression of levels and new challenges.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We use the Chromecast to broadcast to two other tvs. We don't have to pay for more cable boxes. From IPad cast the ESPN games to non-cable tv and shows from Netflicks. Can do other things on the IPad while it does that.  I think there are more video apps for it now, too.  For the price, it works great.  But I cannot use it to control the shows once it gets going on Netflicks.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I learned a lot from this novel. Until I read about the orphan ships that took kids from England to Australia, I never even knew about this part of history.  This book was an easy read and well worth it.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This is a fun game and a good game to relax and have fun with. Its easy to learn and a good fun way to learn battle strategy.
B0013AZLP0|5.0|It is a classical lovers dream. It is clear and the music takes you all over great to study to.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|What can I say...we love the show Bones. My daughter and I enjoy curling up to watch the show. It's funny the little things you pick up watching these type of shows.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This was amazing what you can do with this mouse.  There are more functions then you can shake a stick at and with that driver almost unlimited options as far as a mouse is concerned.  You can load multiple profiles for say office work along with gaming.<br />Switch between profiles. and selecting the dpi can speed up your mouse or slow it down great for accurate drawing program like cad.<br />For the money i paid i would have bought two of them if someone ha mentioned other programs other than gaming for use.<br />Office people this is a mouse you want and a great price for what it can do as well.  After i loaded the weights it was heaven. I have not been on a corded mouse in years but this one is sturdy and the mouse feels great in my hand. So no problem at all.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Exactly as expected.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|More than one generation have already enjoyed this movie and I am certain that several more will as well.  Its classic Disney.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I love this show! I love the cast and enjoy how they interact and play off each other. The storyline is so-so and sometimes not believable, but it's the group of actors that I like.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham did it again - another very good book.  I am still in the process of reading it on my kindle.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I love to write Christmas stories. I read this one before I start a new one because it has all the elements that should be included in a great story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just what the end of the trilogy needed!<br />Love, lying, and destruction of the evil that is very just existing in the world today...
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Clasic and the color in the new version is very well done. I also like have the black and white version. It's fun to watch our young grandchildren's reaction to seeing it since they didn't know there was such a thing.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am so disappointed in the way the author chose to end this series. I am hopeful that they will choose to have a different ending in the movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like this app. It makes it easy to get up in the mornings. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Five stars or fifty there is no better detective thriller to rival this guy ( Pendergast ) to keep you on the edge of your seat. I have read every book they have written in this series and they just get better and better. Enough said, I will now have to wait for the next installment.
1419702238|5.0|I would highly recommend buying these books for your kids. It doesn't matter if they are boys/girls or what age they are. They will love them!
B00280LYIC|3.0|4<br /><br />It was right for me good fantasy<br />I like the action when it happened but there should be more<br />Anyone who likes fantasy
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Love the idea of the game and the physics are great. Just need to make it more of a game. No local records?! No challenging oponnents. If this was worked out with more of a gaming theme, they would have a huge hit. Still, that being said, really like what they have done and will definitely keep an eye out for SR2.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|fairly good story line, acting a little weak.Really ishould only give it 3 1/2 stars, if I could but I cant.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Adorable... I miss the shiver-y .gifs Claire Belton's site is famous for... but the book has a lot that's not on the website. If you like cute drawings and know someone who'd light up if you got her one the most famous cats on the internet... look no further. :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The story made me laugh out loud, it made me cry.  McKenna painted a picture for me.  I didn't want to put the book down.  Looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|I have't seen it yet and i just got it on the playstation 3 and im gowing to watch it
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm pretty impressed with this app. I've already used it as a journal and to make Christmas lists, and I've only had it for about 15 minutes! Decent selection of fonts, themes, and covers. Plus there's an option to password protect it and another to share, bookmark, or attach files. Love it!
1400049628|1.0|First, it's not the book shown.  It has a different cover and I'm not sure if isn't a knock of. I was supposed to get the book that is shown, not some substitute!<br />Second, It took 15 days from order date to delivery.  It was 8 days before it was picked up by the shipper.  That is very poor service.  I doubt very much that I will order anything else from this web site if I have to wait more than 2 weeks to get it.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I am trying to download magazines to my kindle android app and it freezes up and shuts down, my laptop is windows 8 and the kindle app doesn't even support magazines...why sell me something if its not going to work.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Shared another Hitchcock classic with my son.  He has really enjoyed the high suspense, humor, twisting plots, and flawless performances of Cary Grant and his fellow cast members.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The book was like sitting around a campfire listening to a great and wonderful  Jin storyteller.  The power of love between a brother and sister untarnished by distraction or time and space.
B00871C09S|5.0|A classic Hitchcock movie is always worth watching.  I was sharing my love of the old classics with my son.  He really enjoyed the movie!
B000067QMD|2.0|I must be doing something wrong because it leaks. What is the point if it isn't air tight? I just use the regular bottle tops.  However, this is not a knock against the Avent system, these are my favorite bottles, the only ones to decrease spit-up!
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|This action figure of the legendary hero goku is absolutely amazing great action figure to keep for display. Made with quality. I recommend it to whoever likes dragonball z.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It reminds me so much of those cold winter mornings hunting deer. Being out there in the wilderness. just my dad and I and out two favorite rifles.......the good ole days
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|Good acting. Movie theme is ok and is well developed through the story. Could have developed the second half of the movie a bit further, particularly the main character's trouble with the law and his final decision to become a government informant.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|I love action packed movies and White House Down was just that! Even better with your home theater system. Watch it!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|The production of this period piece is outstanding.  The actors are fabulous.  The story is heart warming and the characters are charming.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|worse app i ever bought ... do not buy this app ... sounds like static on an old tv set
B008B68IV8|4.0|She is so cute. I love the sassy look. I think this will make a wonderful Christmas gift. Love the outfit.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The controller is responsive, has a pretty nice texture, sorta matte like (i believe that's what it's called), and the buttons aren't mushy. It came looking like what the picture promised (Nintendo Gamecube logo and such). Its a good buy.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|it's addicting, very challenging, pay attention or you loose, I recomend you reading what each of your aztec worriors do to help the more you know the better your score.
B00DQQSD2W|5.0|A wonderful book, with audio clips inserted.  I don't know how it would go on an e ink reader but it is great on the iPad.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|very good as usual. held in suspense all the time. could not put it down. recommended reading to everyone. read it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A very well told story that at times brings tears to the eyes and at other times makes one laugh out load. The characters are very well developed and by the time one finishes the book one feels that they are friends and acquaintances from real life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The lovely mindless ease of moving colors and hearing: &#34;Divine&#34; or &#34;tasty&#34; when colors explode is soothing. Then if more intellect is in want of use there are higher levels and more push to succeed quickly. Beautifully simple.
B00DW36G32|4.0|Better than people have reviewed it.<br />Not a prize winning movie but still entertaining and different. Worth renting but not buying I think
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|It moves too slowly between frames. As in the polar bear does a &#34;cute&#34; little slide by a penguin which kind of drags down the momentum of the game. Cute graphics, though.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent. Through all of the depressing parts, twists and turns, and fairly decent character development, I was glued to every page. I knew Allegiant was going to be depressing, but the majority of the sad parts are ridiculously unnecessary. A friend of mine who read the book said, &#34;There are plenty of ways to prove a point without destroying your readers.&#34; I couldn't agree more.<br />If anyone is thinking of reading this book, just don't. Or read part of it and make up a happy ending for yourself, it will be so much better than how Mrs. Roth chose to end it.
1567184855|5.0|if you allow yourself to be open to the possibilities this book suggests -- everything around you, and all those tough questions like: How can god allow a child to have cancer-- or, How can god allow so many thousands of people die might have surprising answers. I'm not a new ager as such  -- but this book made me turn the telescope around and look at a lot of tough situations from the other end. I hope it is true. I'm not totally convinced - but there are so many religions and cultures that suggest these very ideas. There is also more and more solid research being done in this area (admittedly with mixed results) -- but it will allow you to sleep a little easier perhaps seeing uncomfortable situations in this light
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't like anything that says its free!!!!!! and then you are asked to buy, buy,buy !!!!!! to go further in the game.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It started out slow and I was disappointed because her other books were so good! But then it picked up and the ending is great! Insurgent is my favorite
B004DLPXAO|4.0|still getting used to the electronic book thing...still lots to learn about how it works. at least it showed up on my tablet after downloading it...still trying to figure out where the games and other apps went once they were downloaded
B005UT29Z0|5.0|Awesome movie!! Entertaining and clever! Maybe the view behind the fall of the economy is too simplistic, but the movie was entertaining. It would have been better without Demi Moore though!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Tris didn't have to die. Really , was there no other solution? Not sure you will get me again .
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Plausible plot line, nice twists.  Great character development.  Engaging action sequences.  Robert De Nero and Jean Reno make a great pair.
B00271SFB6|5.0|well.. Bond is truly  back. and this is yet another great Bond film.<br />As we all know by now! Hope the increase in quality continues.. vis a vis<br />acting direction character! plot.. it's a peach of a film.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Heart wrenching to watch but you have to force yourself to get through to understand what is REALLY happening at Sea World.  What really happens when you take a 12,000 pound whale, put it in nothing bigger than a kiddie pool for its life, force feed it to keep it alive and to make it behave the way you want all for profit?  Things happen.  Bad things happen.  Blackfish happens.<br /><br />I went in skeptical but the turning point for me was watching the mother's scream for the babies as they take them away...in particular the one that made a deep, never before heard sound for hours after her baby calf was taken and hauled off to another gig.  Kind of reminds me of desperate mothers on the news pleading with a kidnapper to give her baby back...<br /><br />These animals don't need to be studied and &#34;saved&#34; by SW...look through their smoke screen and watch the movie to decide for yourself.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This was my least favorite of the Pendergast novels, in fact I found myself skimming over a lot of it. The plot was stretched too thin and, well, just too scattered. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters and the action reminded me of a movie car chase.

B0091WNK8M|4.0|It was cute. I was previewing it before allowing my grandkids to watch it; they're five. They'll have to wait a few more years, it's too scary.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you havent started the first book, dont read it!! Terrible ending!! The ending makes the book and that one was horrible!!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Must See Great film! Love all the actors! Love Pierce Brosnan, but Daniel Craig brings a different style to the 007's.
B00F880BWG|5.0|It's amazing with lots of thrills the cast is great the zombies are old and scary the effects are amazing
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you loved the Shining, this is an excellent answer to what happen to Danny. I really enjoyed all the connections to the Shining,  yet it was its own story. The connection to the Overlook and the Gypsies was great storytelling.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Excellent book. This could really happen what's in this book. Enjoyable and hard to put down book. To bad Tom Clancy passed away.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is one of the strongest 3rd books of a YA trilogy I have read. I highly recommend reading it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|our family LOVES this movie.  kids from 7 up to 27 all sit together and thoroughly enjoy the story, the characters, the creativity.  can be watched year 'roud as it's not really about just one holiday.  highly recommend!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love stuff like this a great super hero it is just a great picture I really enjoyed it and the are many in the avengers
B006LSZECO|2.0|A thrilling read all the way through - very impressive first person chronology from two persons' standpoints, opposite sex, no less. I HATED the ending BAH! HUMBUG!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved this series! I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. I could have done without seeing all the naked women though.
0553801473|3.0|The writing was on par with earlier books.  The story is imaginative and interesting (if frequently disjointed), but the narrative can be ridiculously tedious.  And the author's propensity to destroy leading characters continues to be disruptive even though by now, it is predictable.<br /><br />I might read the 6th book if it comes out before I loose interest.  Who knows?  Maybe something will finally happen.
B005ZMUXDC|2.0|I don't know what happened, but this was the most jittery, choppy stream ever received from Amazon.  I have never had a problem before or after... I have tried other shows/movies since without a problem.  I attempted to replay this movie after trying others and experienced the same spotty problem.  Maybe a server issue?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book!!!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a feel good original love story! Kudos to the author! :)
B00D7HXSVQ|5.0|As with any of Rick Stein's books they are extremely well presented, with great photography and the recipes are the genuine article.  The bit I really love is that each recipe has a narration of where he got it from and it's origins again some from old family traditions.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Pretty fun TCG.  Can get a little frustrating if you don't want to spend extra money on it but if your willing to take the slow and agriculture of pillaging and slowly getting cards with in game gold then it's pretty fun.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|The best album of 2013! ARTPOP is a seriously masterful recorded album by a really hardworking artist that went to my school (NYU) This seriously gives me such an immense pride!<br /><br />Best tracks -- Gypsy, Do What U Want, ARTPOP, and Applause
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Good series, plots, action and actors. I like it a lot, the original NCIS will always be my most favorite (Mark Harmon you know, shows go with the actors you grow up with I guess), but this one isn't bad either. Worth buying the series.
B00FCAJZL8|5.0|I have been a fan for years. This album is outstanding. It is as contemporary sounding as anything else out there.
B003ORZ83K|5.0|I just can't get enough of the &#34;PRIDE AND THE PREJUDICE&#34;.  Since I already have a copy of this version (my favoriate), I bought this one for my nephew and his wife.  I hope they love it as much as I do!!
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|In the aptly-named &quot;King Oddball,&quot; a malevolent anthropomorphic planetoid hurls boulders with its tongue at a variety of earthly defenders and fortifications. -- I swear that I am not making this up!  Think &quot;Angry Birds&quot; meets Miley Cyrus filtered through the Syfy Channel.  For all of that, the game is physics-based and strangely addictive.  Just tap the screen, and the planetoid's tongue releases its boulder to wreck havoc.  Simple yet challenging to master, and refreshingly demented.  Worth having, especially as a FAOTD...
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Awesome movie!<br /> they ask to see it over and over! this movie is funny and so cool!<br />Its going to be a classic!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Love this CD just as much as his other ones. I always love my Drake albums because he always has a song for any and every mood I have. He killed it again.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|We were expecting a better movie as we love watching movies starring Mathew McConaughey, I would skip on this one...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun way to play a strategy game.  Only bad part is you need help from others from time to time.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|Great movie!! My son has watched it everyday since I bought it. Teaches children not to give up on :)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is amazing . It have one of the best  soo far I have come across.. whoever doesn't have it, omg I pity you... :). Be blessed n be a blessing
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Sorry whootie fans....Darius. Is our country boy now and you can not have him back....he is now a country man all the way!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Those is a fun and addictive game. I like it much better the a an the original Castleville. The e only thing that i don't like is s this that to have more than one of any of workshops it costs crowns and a lot of them. Over all though i really like the game. Graphics are good too
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Awesome app. I can now print from my phone. I've been searching for a way to print documents from my phone and this app makes it super easy to do.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I am in love with this game! Its great for the family, one of the greatest game's I have played,and its FREE!
B000002KDS|5.0|What can I say?  Alice Cooper ROCKS.  I had this album on vinyl but never replaced it with a CD.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I thing this game is a game to play with the fan also to enjoy and this game  helps you expand your thinking
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Stellar mix if intellect and drama. I recommend Suits to everyone I know. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't absolutely love this show.
0671449028|3.0|The book was a standard board book. It would be a great book for toddlers. I would recommend it to parents who have a problem going to bed.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|As always, David Sedaris is absolutely laugh out loud hilarious!  No one can tell a story as well as he can.  Highly recommended!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham does it again...Intrigue, mystery and a great legal battle.  Love the characters from Clanton.  Lucien Wilbanks is the epitome of the disenfranchised attorney, who really does want to do the right thing.<br /><br />If they do make this a movie (and I cannot imagine that they won't), I hope they can get the same cast as 'A Time To Kill' to play the same characters as before!
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Awesome movie. One of our all-time faves. Constant action, total guy flick. Great to watch after your wife makes you sith through a romantic comedy (which are never really comedies, are they?). Shoot, explode, wear hot pants, blow more stuff up, what more do you want. This isn't the best known movie, but it really rocks.
0307291650|4.0|Nice Book, to add to my fantasy bookshelf, beautiful presentation. Thank U for the quick and easy transaction. I will buy from you again when I have a choice.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|when you need a movie that does not require any thought and will make you laugh this is a good choice.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Some thirty years ago I read a book that was one of the scariest I had ever read and it was the book that made me love Stephen King.<br />The book was The Shining and now King has returned to the story of Danny Torrence and what has happened to him all these years after the terrifying events at The Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />Time has not been kind to Dan; unsurprisingly he is following the family tradition and is an alcoholic with a long history of lost jobs and broken promises. After a particularly bad drunken night Danny gets on a bus and ends up in a small New England town, where he takes one more stab at turning his life around. But Danny’s “shine” isn’t gone and when a young girl reaches out to Danny he becomes involved in her life as a group known as the True Knot tries to find her for their own terrifying reasons.<br /><br />While a sequel to The Shining, Doctor Sleep stands on it’s own. There are references to the previous book, but only those who have read the book would recognize them, you do not need to read The Shining to enjoy Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book and I wasn’t disappointed. The horror level isn’t quite as high as in The Shining but it is still very creepy. As usual it is King’s characters that make the story so engrossing. You come to care about all of the characters and even the evil ones evoke a little bit of understanding if not exactly compassion. The book also explores a lot of real life issues including aging, death and trying to maintain sobriety. They re all handled with honesty and often with humor. There was also quite an interesting twist at the end that I didn’t see coming.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the tip of the hat to King’s son Joe Hill. It’s a mention of a character from NOS4A2 and I thought it was sweet that he honored him that way.<br /><br />Overall a very good suspense/horror novel that I enjoyed very much, but I am a huge King fan and it’s rare that I don’t enjoy his writing.oy his writing.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|classic! understated and yet riddled with layers of resentment and quips of charm. an ode to the lost of art of conversation, dichotomy and similarity between aristocrat/working class, clever/witless, beautiful/drab - and the world begins to enjoy the realization that there is quite a world to put to pen in the head of Julian Fellowes.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is classic King. Well drawn characters , with main contribution a thoughtful exploration of moral responsibility and making amends.
B0032W5H9C|5.0|I pinched this review from another - because I agree exactly:<br />Aside from its portrayal of a teenager, the film depicts the apparently limited options for a graduating female at the time. She either could excel academically and get a job, or she could find a husband who could take care of her. It is interesting how Jenny's parents are motivated by this mode of thinking and how it guides their actions. There is an aspect to the story which borders on statutory laws regarding sex with a girl who is barely of adult age. The storytellers finesse their way around this and focus on the relationship and do a tasteful job in minimizing the lurid possibilities. Subtle hints of racism are folded into the narrative, this being the 1960's.<br /><br />In the end, it is Carey Mulligan in a star making turn as the idealistic teen who matures ahead of her own time and learns about life the hard way.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Interesting, but the lack of common sense in some of the characters left me wanting to slap them.  I didn't recommend it to anyone and for me, that's noteworthy.
1582406723|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the TV show and a huge comic book fan in general, but I actually ordered this as a gift for my Mother, who is obsessed with the show. She hasn't started reading it yet but I have, and so far so good. Honestly I prefer the characterizations on the TV show more, and there are big events in the TV show that seem to be glossed over so quickly in the book. But I love to storyline and the art is beautiful. Also the introduction by Robert Kirkman, where he explains his motivations for writing Walking Dead, was interesting to read.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This recording is pure soulful joy in a s***ty world. As the United States essentially nosedives into all of the terrible psychological effects of avarice, narcissism, and overpopulation, to name but a few, it's nice to at least hear someone is seeing the same things I am, and feels how I feel about it. What a delightful way this band has of acknowledging the devaluing circumtances of our times, and celebrating that. Musically, it's a sumptuous sonic feast. It's just magnificent.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Story bogs down in the middle.  He is not a very likable character.  Can't relate to the main character very well. His adult character is too vague.
B000T46NOE|5.0|Great movie!  I love the story.  It is action packed and very entertaining.  There is a lot of violence but it very cartoon-like so not as bad for younger viewers.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|You just fall for Mr. White. From the first episode it captures you and makes you want to call in sick so you can watch all 7 episodes in one day
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love this game... if you don't want to sleep at night: or anytime for that matter...then this is the game for you. yay!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I have downloaded at least 8 other pool games. 8Ball Pool is definitely the best! The graphics &amp; cue options (backline, tailspin, etc.) are Top-Notch. The gameplay options, skill level increases, option to practice offline &amp; being able to challenge friends or someone anonymous make this a MUST-DOWNLOAD-NOW APP! The only improvements I would recommend would be to make 9-Ball &amp; Straight Pool available. Nevertheless, 5 STARS FOR A GREAT, CHALLENGING &amp; FREE GAME! Wth Miniclip!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book had all of the action and plot twists that I've come to expect from this series, and of course some romance. What I love is that all of those big concepts that she introduces in Divergent (like Tris's feelings about bravery and selflessness) get fully explored and wrapped up in Allegiant. It almost had a John Green-esque immensity, which is why I loved it.
B005544V6A|5.0|My sister recommended this show.  I must admit, it kept me up many nights because I wanted to see all the episodes as fast as I can.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Excellent show and a somewhat accurate portrayal of King Henry VIII. If you enjoy history you will enjoy The Tudors.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Each episode is as good as the next.  I can't stop watching until I have seen every episode.  It is a very entertaining show.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Love this movie. Needed subtitles and this dvd offered them as an option. No complaints. Playback clear without any skips.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie and terrific acting. Really enjoyed watching using Amazon prime. Can't wait to watch my next movie with Prime
072325804X|5.0|Beautiful book. Comes in one big volume with a hard cover, inside a protective hardcover box. To include all of the original Beatrix Potter illustrations in one book, they had to be fairly small--like two to three illustrations per page formatted in with the text. I suppose that's necessary, though, as the book would be far too large if each were given a printed page.
0385340990|5.0|If you like history during WWII, book groups, letters, and endearing characters, this is an original and memorable book which combines them artfully.  Our fiction library book group read it. It's one of the few books which we read which everyone loved.  It's humorous, poignant, intelligent and upbeat, although it has difficult scenes.  What a delight.  It was written by a librarian who had traveled to Guernsey and researched its history.  The author didn't live long enough to finish the book, so she never saw the acclaim it received.  Her niece finished the book for her.  If you are looking for a good read, this offers it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Lovely little movie. Great actors and a joy to watch over & over. I really liked Judi Dench in this.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Leading man still interesting. Leading woman still annoying. All I can think of is that girl that played Bella in the Twilight movies. Grammar still an issue and ended up skipping sex scenes seeing there were way too many of them. Story became boring with all the sex scenes. Sex scenes were hot when used so many times, but there were times I was wondering if there was some magical vitamin to make them have sex all the time like rabbits.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Today's Free App of the Day is a fun physics game, if a bit weird.  Like, say, Angry Birds, the goal is to fling something and destroy targets.  In this case, you're helping King Oddball defend his world.  You use a boulder stuck to the King's tongue (kinda creepy!) and you destroy tanks to clear the land of the enemy.  <br /><br />You have to pick the right moment to tap the screen to release the boulder.  Like most of these games, you get three tries to destroy all of the items (tanks).  Unlike most of these games, it's all or nothing--there are no stars to earn, at least not in the first level.  You either succeed and move on or you don't, in which case you can try again or &#34;retreat.&#34; Retreat means you can try a different round in the same level.  Unlike most of these games, progress is not linear.  In keeping with the game's premise that you are defending your territory, you are playing to clear a grid.  As you win a round, you can play additional rounds adjacent to your cleared area on the grid.  You start in the lower left hand corner of the grid.  For example, after clearing the first round, you can try either the space above it or to the right.  If you decide to &#34;retreat,&#34; you can play one of the other available uncleared areas in that level.<br /><br />Starting with the second level, there are achievements--completing a level using only one rock, hitting the king with a rock (this can happen when a rock bounces off one of the targets or gets thrown by dynamite), destroy a thousand enemies, etc.  Special things, like diamonds seem to appear once you get past a certain level, too.  And there are achievements for collecting those.<br /><br />There are 16 squares to clear per level.  And it looks like nine levels.<br /><br />Apparently you get extra boulders if you clear three targets with a single boulder--I haven't achieved that yet.<br /><br />This was fun and compelling, though the whole tongue thing stuck to a boulder is kind of odd.  But it works.  I like not having the pressure to try to have a perfect round and earn three stars.  You do get a compliment from the King after you've cleared the round, and they seem to be better (Spectacular! vs Nice!) if you get use fewer boulders, but that's about it.<br /><br />I'll give this five stars.  Unique variation, some unique aspects to the gameplay, a tutorial.  Can be played in airplane mode.<br /><br />'Bout the only thing I was slightly disappointed in was that there's no way to replay a round after clearing it. (Which is just my OCD kicking in--trying to clear the level with the first boulder, which is not required.) But then I found that when you discover the Hall of Diamonds in the second level, you can then replay old levels.  Yay!  Achievements are also unlicked during the second round.  And there is a &#34;Secret Mustache World&#34; somewhere.d of odd.  But it works.  I like not having the pressure to try to have a perfect round and earn three stars.  You do get a compliment from the King after you've cleared the round, and they seem to be better (Spectacular! vs Nice!) if you get use fewer boulders, but that's about it.<br /><br />I'll give this five stars.  Unique variation, some unique aspects to the gameplay, a tutorial.  Can be played in airplane mode.<br /><br />'Bout the only thing I was slightly disappointed in was that there's no way to replay a round after clearing it.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Love the leading man, found the leading woman annoying. So, can see Twilight characters in this book, which I'm not really a fan of Twilight (Interesting leading man, leading woman annoying, because she over-analyzes and just causes issues to make leading man jealous)  Interesting plot and back story for leading man. Had some issues reading it due to grammar issues, but not too bad.
0446310786|5.0|Simply the best book I've ever read.  Told from the perspective of a young girl (the first thing I loved when I first read it), it deals with the single most important and ongoing social issue in America: race.  And finally, I see something different every time I read it.  It took me a while to realize that the true heroic figure in the book is Jem.<br /><br />Finally, as a reader, How can one NOT love a book that contains the line &#34;Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read.  One does not love breathing.&#34;<br /><br />Sigh....I wish it were available on Kindle.
B00AF82WTO|1.0|That was just bad! From the very first scene you can tell something is not right. We get no introduction of characters. Who is Ann and who is her family? All of the other characters were just there to exist. We don't get any background stories to relate to.<br /><br />Why alter events? this is a classic novel, why change them? Eliminate main scenes and famous lines?<br />And for the life of me I can't understand why some of the female characters were cast so old: The actress playing Elizabeth looked rather 40, though she is supposed to be only 29. Mrs Croft is 38, yet the actress was well beyond 50.<br />And why Mary appeared to have an IQ of 25?<br /><br />The only positive not is that captain Wentworth is handsome.<br /><br />If you have't read the book or seen previous version I wouldn't recommend this to you, you will be scratching you head wondering what and why and who.<br /><br />Dare I say the 1971 version is superior to this one.<br />Sigh. What a disappointment. I love this novel. I love the 1995 version, Its amazing and takes you back in time..
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I love this album. I would def recommend this album to any on who like Korn. One of my fav albums.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's captivating. Interesting. Keeps you wanting to know more. Great book. I love reading this book. Easy read. I would recommend reading this book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game was legendary.awesome customizable stuff. You should get this app.highly recommend u get this app. Go on buy the app!
B008GX2YX4|5.0|This caught a lot of flak for being too dense. That is a stupid criticism. The most rewarding things are dense, particularly in music. I find new things on each listen. Such a unique sound on every instrument. And the pop genius is still there. Don't hesitate, the album art is amazing to see up close also.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just awful. Don't waste your time. It is badly written. Roth attempts to write from different character perspectives but that is not her strength at all. The cliffhanger from the second book was intriguing, but the third book proves to be stupid. Makes me regret ever starting this trilogy.
B006OAB2WK|5.0|Great pop album. Good ideals and ideas. Great voice. Pretty simple, not all songs are standout, but this is her biggest step forward and I'm really looking forward to her next album. Hope that you like electropop
B001EBYMAI|2.0|This story is clever clever. Probably entertaining so long as you don't know anything about Christianity. But if you have even a passing knowledge the plot devices are simply ridiculous. I laughed out loud at some of it, when I was supposed to be creeped out or whatever. If I had to describe the film in one word it would be &#34;Dumb&#34;.
B008EG717C|5.0|Lyrically hilarious/profound. Maybe you think I am nostalgic or overtly romantic but I listen to much pop music and lyrics such as this are sparse in my opinion. Not to mention the band is tight and production totally clean. Easy to focus on the songwriting and emotional content when it's presented so well. Maybe I am a sap. If you're considering this album, you may be as well. Bask in it
B000S5AISQ|5.0|Can't beat the price for classic Pixies.  No longer a hole in my library.  Still sounds good after all these years.
B001MW0J2E|5.0|Obviously this is their most widely appreciated album. And it's a shame because they are an amazing band at every turn. I'd suggest you buy another album. Maybe Sung Tongs or Feels or check out their EPs on the internet. You aren't a bro are you? No hate, just wondering.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I started this book. It sucks you in very fast and is hard to put down. I read them all and really enjoyed them. Glad I stumbled across this book. Howey can really write and the plot is so good.
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|Minimal. The essential elements. Heavy focus on vocals. However rich. The perfect record for someone who wants to tell others &#34;i'm chill so you can relax&#34;
B0083GDLL8|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums ever recorded. Definitely on of David Bowie's best. If you like Bowie and don't own this or used to but don't have it anymore then you should buy it. Lots of good songs.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham lives up to his reputation.  The book keeps your attention to the end. He never disapppoints his readers with his plots and twists.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|Great Movie! It should be a crime to keep large marine animals in such small enclosed spaces. I would recommend this movie to all critical thinkers.
B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|Fun and very addictive.  The only thing I would like to see different is the tanks and changing it up.
B00933U1EU|2.0|Homeland mascaras as a procedural thriller, but implicit in almost every shot is two-dimensional, us vs. them caricature of Arab societies and the U.S. defense system, especially the Marines.  Gordon and Gansa have made a fortune stoking America's paranoia, first with 24, now Homeland.  It's based on an Israeli show, which had little of Homeland's over-the-top terror fears. It was about reintegration of POWs, a legitimate subject in itself.  Homeland turns this into a tawdry, overacted CIA fantasy. That so many professional critics praise Homeland says a lot about the state of mind of the Fifth Estate.  Clare Danes is a hyperactive robot; in 20 years her character will be played by an android, and look the same.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I didn't like this book at all! By the way the chapters flip back and forth I knew what was going to happen by chapter 2. This didn't keep me intrigued at all like the first two. Boo! Don't waste your time. If you read the first two, just make up a story of your own. Trust me on this.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved the Shining, and Doctor Sleep  is the perfect sequel to answer the question of what became of Danny, the little kid who survived the terror  at the old Overlook Hotel.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|So over Rick this season.  There is something thats lacking big time.  At this point I'm giving it 1 more time and if it doesn't get<br />any better I'm giving it up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Must Read<br />It is the best he has written since &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;. You actually visualize Oxford, Mississippi, etc. He writes what he knows in this novel......the south, the southern people and traditions, the importance of politics to Southerns, etc.<br /> I truely enjoyed reading this novel.<br />  Liz Coco<br />  (Louisiana Native)
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Great movie, but it would be better if it were a little less predictably moral. For example (not a spoiler), when somebody is using cocaine and there is fun music playing, you know it isn't going to end well.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I haven't quite finished reading it but this is a hard book to put away.  I find it pulling me in from across the room. I have read the authors 2 prior books,  also great.  Good stories that are told to perfection.  Keep writing Donna!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It starts a out a little slow and confusing, but don't get bogged down in the proper Portuguese pronunciations; press through them and you'll quickly find yourself with Ender in the middle of a mystery, sci-fiction, ethnology, autobiography and international intrigue all rolled up in one story.
B008469DGY|5.0|I've been enjoying this game a lot, it has a good amount of challenge to it but it is not frustrating like other games.
B007KGXY0K|1.0|I bought one ASUS Z9PE-D8 WS motherboard and 4 GTX 690 cards and the motherboard only recognizes only one GTX 690 card.<br />I researched and saw that other people had the same problem. I tried to find a solution on the website of ASUS and EVGA and so far I had no success. And I'm still looking for some firmware that solves the problem of the motherboard.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A bizarre departure as a sequel to &#34;The Shining.&#34; Danny (Dan) Torrance is all grown up and battling alcoholism, drifting around the country, trying to find his place. He does, and what starts off as a compelling and gritty set up, ends rather routinely- for Mr. King, that is. I am a huge fan of his work, but I just didn't feel the third act lived up to the first two. Inevitably, this will be a film. I have a hard time seeing it as such; so much is internal. But that is the novel's strong point: we fully enter Torrance's head and feel each step of his mental struggle as he battles a (sort of) new form of evil. Wish the plot adhered a bit more to themes of the Overlook, but that wasn't what Mr. King was going for. Still very much worth enjoying.
B00CE27NE8|1.0|The story is pretty ridiculous, the script about as bad as one can get and the acting so-so as the cast had so little to work with. I could hardly see it through to the end and will happily be offering this disc to anyone that wants it. One of the poorest films I have watched in a long while. Rent at best.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This was different but good. there wasn't the puns that the other Bonds made. But it suspenseful and full of action.
B004HHKFIY|5.0|Works great with Imaginarium train set. Was worried that they would be too big. The train is supper durable as well. After being thrown and run around the tracks no broken wheels or chipped paint.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|This was done very, My heart breaks for these animals. I truly feel that it's not Tilikum Sea World needs to fear, He is frustrated and wants to be free. aka go back home to his family. I am sure he misses his mother. And all the others miss their families too. Then to add insult to injury. they separated a baby orca from her mother that was born at Sea World saw first hand at what happens when they do that. The mother cried out for her calf. This is so inhumane. Please watch this. I highly recommend this.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|Works great with Imaginarium train set. Was worried that they would be too big. The train is supper durable as well. After being thrown and run around the tracks no broken wheels or chipped paint.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Awesome movie, sad story, my kids like it a lot. Good moral teaching. Not only for Halloween, can watch whenever
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|Works great with Imaginarium train set. Was worried that they would be too big. The train is supper durable as well. After being thrown and run around the tracks no broken wheels or chipped paint.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Love this movie, one of my favorite Christmas movies. So glad I found it here, for a good price too!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|this is a remarkable review of the early writings and the still current controversy over what was historical and what was imagined...
B0056TYT66|1.0|Installed on Dell Studio XPS 9110 with Intel X58 chipset which supports PCIE version 2. Slowed down both my SATA 6.o drives nearly in half. Giving MemoryC and Transcend a chance to fix before I return, but tech support is email only which sucks.<br /><br />BTW Transcend sells online customer chat product. Hilarious?
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Infinite possibilities with only the mind to limit what can be done. Can I make a robot mow my lawn? Wash my car? protect my house? Heck ya! Feed the dog, pick up the !@@#4%^ from the dog! Write code and learn. Stretch the gray matter. Start a project with your kid and make it a bonding memory. If a flunky old truck driver like myself can do it, who can't? Someone worked very hard to make this controller format simple.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I ave never read the Jack Reacher books.  However, I have enjoyed the Jack Reacher movies.  Tom Cruise was excellent in this movie.  He is a good actor -- Reacher is not a bust a gut person -- but he is fantastic and Tom Cruise did it well.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This is a great movie.  It is very spooky.  I watched it with my whole family and it was a hit!
B009369Z8A|5.0|True story and very good.  It is somewhat violent -- yet that how it was.  It ends -- well, I can't tell you how it ends - but it has a very interesting ending.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I just can't get enough of the iron man sequals this movie is a great family movie fullof action, comedy, and lots of great special effects. I can't wait to see iron man return in the Avengers 2.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a road tale in which an unlikely hero walks the length of England for reasons that are only gradually revealed. Rachel Joyce has crafted a fine and twisty adventure, both heart-warming and scary.  Be warned: this is not the light-hearted story that the opening chapters suggest.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|didn't work, just got text for the fields, no formatting or graphics , just blue text on my Nook Color
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Too wordy and too many characters. By the end, i was exhausted from trying to finish reading this book. The story line never stopped.
B00EJYGQFG|1.0|Love the song. Took forever to get the item and I must have misread or was mislead. It was just the one song not the album.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|good book.  sometimes it is good to get outside your comfort zone to ensure that you understand human nature in all it's glory.  Everyone is not like yourself
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Plot wasn't particularly attention-getting. And for me, Sean Connery will always be James Bond. No one since has measured up to the ideal...
B007XWFZSA|5.0|This is absolutely the best book on case interviews. It offers a less-than-obvious customized approach which will probably be too complex for people who don't already have a consulting mindset (and, arguably, these people don't belong in the industry anyway), but if you are promising, the book makes you an absolute machine. Highly recommend, along with other prep materials on Victor's website.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Just like Shakespeare is portrayed in modern day, I think this movie is most appropriately portrayed in &#34;modern&#34; era. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, the music is modern in lyric but made old-timey in style... it is a brilliant adaptation of a beloved novel. Watching this movie made me realize how much I've missed reading literature. I've watched many versions of this book made into a movie, and this is by far my favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Not bad D. washington is always my hero. It should be some more hearing @ the court bit over all is not bad
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I have just finished reading The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert (author of the bestseller Eat, Pray, Love).  I have spoken with a few people who finished reading The Signature of All Things, and I find it interesting that there appears to be a wide range of opinions about the book.  One reviewer said she  loved it and found it endlessly fascinating, while another reader said it was boring and not worth finishing.  I think the reason for the disparity of opinion about this book is that in some ways it is a book with a split personality!<br /><br />On the one hand , The  Signature of All Things is a story about love in all its forms, love between men and women, love between children and their parents, love among siblings, and love for dearly held principals or passions.  The book’s protagonist  Alma Whittaker participates with varying degrees of success in all these love relationships.  Her intense search for love drives the story and generates our  alternating  feelings of  compassion or impatience for her.<br /><br />On the other hand, Alma’s primary passion, for science, observation, and classification brings an entirely different  slant and depth to the book.  Anyone interested in the history of science, or in botany, evolution, natural science, or the accomplishments of women in science would find this aspect of the story equally as compelling as Alma’s emotional struggles, if not more so.  I am interested in all the subjects I just mentioned, so I loved reading about Alma’s painstaking, scientific observations and theories which eventually led her to a revolutionary insight.  However,  I can understand that not all readers would be willing to plow though pages of Alma’s close, not to say obsessive, observation of mosses, a study she devotes most of her life to and which occupies a major portion of her  time, thought, and intelligence.<br /><br />Yet  it is Alma’s lifelong  passion for mosses that defines her personality and determines her place in the world.  It is her obsessive, perfectionist need to understand  the natural world and her ability to extrapolate her findings to include the world of humans  that leads to her astounding insights and ultimately prevents her from sharing her theories with the world.<br /><br />The Signature of All Things is not an easy read; it is long and complex and at times too full of coincidences to be entirely believable.  However, it is also quite thought-provoking. The  character of Alma is fully developed and  entirely believable in her many errors, misunderstandings, passions,  and regrets.  Throughout her long life ( a period  that encompasses 1800 up through the early 1880’s),  Alma never fails to be her own worst enemy; but she is also a woman of extraordinary ability, determination,  courage, and ultimately, compassion and  wisdom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the most amazing book! Keeps you drawn in and on edge the whole time. Would definately recommend !
B004HWT6DO|5.0|By 2013, you would have to be the most disconnected, non-technical person in the world to not know what Facebook is.  With over 1 billion current active users, there has never been a more ubiquitous method to connect to so many people in the world.  Of course, there have been social network sites in the past that made somewhat of an impact (Six Degrees, Friendster, MySpace), but never with the reach that Facebook has achieved.  A seminal cultural construct like this begs to have its origin story told.<br /><br />  \\"The Social Network\\" is the relatively successful attempt to tell that story.  Adapted for big screen by impresario Aaron Sorkin, \\"The Social Network\\" is based on the book \\"The Accidental Billionaires\\" by Ben Mezrich.  There is some debate over the accuracy and over-dramatic nature of Mezrich's account.  However, assessing accuracy should not be the point of a review like this.  Assessing the entertainment value, acting and plot is the point.  On that baseline, \\"The Social Network\\" is a very entertaining tale that holds up under multiple viewings.<br /><br />  The plot surrounds how Harvard undergrad, Mark Zuckerberg, along with friends Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz (and, later, Sean Parker) brought Facebook to life and the roller-coaster of battles that ensued:  with the Harvard campus for violating privacy; with the Winkelvoss twins for allegedly stealing their idea and using it to create Facebook; with Saverin, after he was unceremoniously booted out of the company.  The acting is top notch.  Jesse Eisenberg looks like Zuckerberg's doppelganger and acts very much like how one who expect `Zuck' to act based on his public persona.  Andrew Garfield exudes pathos as the frustrated and betrayed Saverin.  A real find in \\"The Social Network\\" is Justin Timberlake, who plays Sean Parker, the highly motivated entrepreneur (and Napster Co-Founder) who is determined to help take Facebook to next many levels.  Timberlake continues to prove that he has legitimate acting chops (see \\"Alpha Dog\\" for another example).  He's not just a former boy band member trying to `diversify'.<br /><br />  One interesting aspect of repeated viewings of \\"The Social Network\\" is how your perception of the main characters can change over time.  Upon the initial viewing, Zuckerberg comes across as a complete anti-social, self-centered jerk while Saverin seems like the earnest, hard-working and horribly-wronged co-founder.  However, when you see the story unfold multiple times, you realize that, while some of the personality traits remain constant, the motivations are no longer as black and white as they seemed.  You can see that Zuckerberg had a vision for making Facebook something well beyond your typical social site and Parker (who seems Machiavellian, initially) has the know-how and drive to make that happen.  Saverin, who you would original sympathize with, begins to be seen as more of a guy who was content to let this be a middle-of-the-road business (as his actions would show), as he lacked the insight to see outside the box and help take Facebook to where it would go.<br /><br />  Overall, \\"The Social Network\\" is a fascinating parable about business, college life and friendship.... And all the headaches they entail.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is funny and has action and if you just want something of both genres i can only tell you watch it.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The author weaves together historical characters and events in such a way that the reader finds the dynamism of 1927, while learning much about what made people like Lindsbergh. Babe Ruth, Al Capone come alive.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought the book was touching and sensitive. I thought the characters were well developed. I thought it was also a nice easy read.
B002LESNES|4.0|A classic western with John Wayne and Maureen o'hara. Well done with humor. I wonder how long it took to get the mud out of their clothes. Touches on relations with the indians and conserving the land.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really loved this book. So enjoyed revisiting \\"old friends\\" first met in \\"A Time to Kill\\"(probably my favorite Grisham book). I literally could not step reading & read until 1am first nite & continued next day for several hours until I finished. Very very well written. It was wonderful to know that Jake&Carla were happy together & were still the REALLY GOOD PEOPLE we met before. Jake has continued to grow as an attorney & I'm hoping to read more about him in future books. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a GREAT story. It's ok if you didn't read \\"A Time to Kill\\" but I highly recommend it--one of my top 10 books I've ever read.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Start your Christmas season with Christmas Vacation. This movie will put you in the mood. We laugh every time we watch it. It's a family tradition to watch on thanksgiving and christmas day.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love mysteries and this was a great one,  You don't know the answer until almost the very end.  Exciting.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Typical Brown, you know what you get when you read him. Not as good as The Da Vinci code, but only because it kind of repeats itself. Just entertaining
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I use this to download books and magazines for studying. I use it regularly. Love this application. I highly recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you enjoyed Divergent, tolerated Insurgent, do not go anywhere near Allegiant. This book killed Veronica Roth's career, or at least I hope it does. Poorly written, endless plot holes, and a ridiculous ending. At points in the story I felt like the author was trying to convince herself and the readers that this book made sense. Well, she failed to do any convincing. No more Veronica Roth books for me, at least not until she can learn to develop a plot properly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game makes you think. I t makes you frustrated at times but when you step back and come back to it you eventually can come up with the resolution. I received this as a free app; and have recommended it to friends.Truely a brain exercise extraordinaire.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Not what I expected.  I really don't care for the program and uninstalled it from my Fire.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, I just didn't like playing it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|GREAT! This is the best Bond film ever made. The story is very good & finally gives us a close look at where Bond came from. The actors are exceptional & Daniel Craig is simply perfect as Bond. The theme song & score are exquisite, as is the cinematography---most particularly the lighting.This is not only a great Bond film but it's simply a great film!!
B008D28HYS|3.0|I love &#34;pick a pix&#34; puzzles.  This one is lots of fun, but lacks some useful features.  There is no way to undo moves except by clicking on each square again.  An undo button would be very useful.  Also they become very difficult and complex and a &#34;hint&#34; button, or &#34;check&#34; capability would eliminate a lot of frustration.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Much more of a story then people make out. A great, but different, love story. One of the best I have read lately.
B0055S348W|5.0|Works just like it should.  I can now print to my wireless printer from my Fire.  No trouble installing or configuring it.  I would highly recommend this app.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good movie, but not a great one. It starts a little slow, but the action builds as the movie progresses. Story line is a little hard to follow.
B009CGDERO|5.0|Great picture! Great movie! If you're firefly fan, you'll love Serenity!<br />Nice to have it forever, and I hope is around that long.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Got this for my car. I just like backups and I use my smartphone A LOT...so I have chargers at work, in the car, at home in several locations etc. This Anker product got good reviews for my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy S4 ACTIVE. I've had trouble with car phone chargers in the past and am looking forward to how well and how long this one works. For now, everything fits and works great.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I am enjoying it. I wish I'd known it was a sequel. I'd have read that one first. It is interesting to see how the Southern heritage is involved in this story.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I almost said I don't like it, but that's not fair to the actors, writers and producers. It's a personal thing, not their fault. Ok, trying to view it from someone else's eyes. . . it was a gripping movie, very well made, and Denzel's acting was superb. Maybe a little too good. lol... which is why it just hit too close to home and brought back so many HORRIBLE memories of living with my EX husband who is a meth addict, as I tried to &#34;save&#34; him, but when I died in '05 b/c of him, I gave up, divorced, been single ever since and so free from that evil world. I have never been addicted to anything in my life, except maybe music, and never did drugs, so I had no idea what living with someone like that was like. I literally got sick watching this, it was so real, although not nearly as bad as what I lived through. Brought back too many memories I buried. So, no I did not enjoy watching it. BUT it IS a good movie from another's viewpoint. Well made.
B008EKMB82|3.0|I loved all her earlier work but this one was a bit much.  It was too overdone and `i struggled to engage with the stroy.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This was free. I will never use it, now that Google Docs has proliferated so far. I'm sure that it's good software, I just try to keep all my eggs in one basket.

B00G9U7R2O|5.0|A great kids and adult movie that the whole family can watch. Great visuals, jokes and acting from the entire cast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I accidentally downloaded Candy Crush to my kindle, but it's been great. I work in law enforcement, so after a long and stressful day, I can play Candy Crush, clear my head, and relax. I recommend this game for anyone who needs to clear their head after a long day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  I was so glad that this game came out for Kindle.  Now I know what everyone was talking about.  The game is addictive.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a captivating and heartbreaking (in a good way) finish to the saga. The minute i read the first word, my eyes were glued. It made the, normally brain-numbingly boring, 10 hour flights a heart stopping experiance.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Best show ever!!! My daughter watches it every night to go to bed. Iv seen and memorized every episode! It's perfect for little ones and has no words so it leaves your brain to imagine!

1484156005|5.0|Christoph Fischer has done it again with Sebastian. This is a story of love, heartbreak, and war.<br /><br />Sebastian, at the beginning if the tale, is a weak child who allowed an infection take hold of him so badly in his leg that he ended up with an amputation. His equally weak mother, Vera, makes mistakes that jeopardize his health.<br /><br />Against the odds, Sebastian is able to live a full rich life. Full of colorful characters and extensive historical accuracy, this is one to add to your historical fiction shelves.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Fantastic. Great sound, great show. Video could use far less cutting; pretty frantic. One of the best groups in gothic\choral\symphonic\rock.
1492391719|5.0|Fischer has such a talent at portraying family dynamics. Having read all three of his books niw, I consider myself a fan.<br /><br />The Black Eagle Inn, again portraying Germany's histroy, deals with the trials and tribulations of a country family who own a farm and inn. What is different about this book us that Fischer approaches the issues of foreigners in Germany post World War II and the acceptance of homosexuality in Germany.<br /><br />As usual, Fischer approaches these subjects with poise and class.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Excellent history of Amazon and biography of Jeff Bezos - including the Good, the Bad, & the Ugly of both.  Based on extensive interviews with friends and detractors of Bezos and Amazon.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|There are two camps in regard to this yet another exhumation of a comic book hero – those who worship at its altar  (and allow it to achieve a box office intake of $291,021,565 in the USA alone, with nearly equal international numbers), and those who see the entertainment value of the film that is in dire need of editing at least 45 minutes of extraneous repetitive CGI effects to make it tolerable. The cast is very fine – hunky Henry Cavill is a rather demure Superman and that is in his favor, Amy Adams makes Lois Lane credible, Michael Shannon is ominous as the evil General Zod, and then there are the home-baked goodness of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe and Amtje Traue as the variable parents (Krypton genes, Kansas adoption). Nods also go to Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, and Laurence Fishburne for trying to take all this seriously.<br /><br />Plot (not really adapted from the original comic books):  A child, sent to Earth from a dying planet, is adopted by a couple in rural Kansas. As a young boy he learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.<br /><br />Sounds like a good story through the sci-fi telescope. The problem is the heavy handed emphasis on the monsters and space ships and tunnels and gore of Krypton and the mess made not only in Smallville, Kansas but in the major cities by the invading Krypton dudes. Makes you wonder when all the CGI minds behind it will tire of the noise and fire and space sailing of Superman. Enough already.<br /><br />Grady Harp
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|it was a good movie marvels made robert downey jr and the other actors did a good job in this movie
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|Interesting and entertaining plot, with interesting, well developed characters.  Great acting across the board, but Julianna Margulies stands out from the rest!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This movie feels right. They paid attention to detail and delivered. I can't speak to historical accuracy, but it looks like they got most things right.
B0085PFG1U|4.0|This is a nifty &#34;little&#34; app. It has a powerful graphing calculator that allows one to view overlaying graphs of a function and its first and second derivatives. It does not give the formula for the derivative but will allow you to check if your work to find the derivative is correct by seeing if the two graphs coincide. The calculator portion factors polynomials as they are typed in. While this is not a stand-alone app as it is nowhere near as comprehensive as the TI-83 or TI-84 or the Nspire handhelds, it serves as a support. For example I have not been able to discern if one can evaluate the value of a function for a given &#34;x&#34; other than dragging a vertical or horizontal axis which is limited to discrete built in values for x. But it is an intuitive, easy to use app that serves my purposes now. Perhaps when I have more time to explore the TI Nspire CAS I'll find it too can do what this one does so easily.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This was, by far, the most comprehensive look at Superman that has been done in years.  From the cells of dead Kryptonians fused within him, to his childhood and his powers reeking havok because he doesn't know how to control them, to humans being afraid of him and the government putting handcuffs on him, so that they can interrogate him, to that battle with General Zod and the destruction that it caused...it was all awesome!  LOVE IT TOTALLY!!  That last scene with Zod took me by suprise...NEVER EXPECTED THAT MOVE...but I understood why it had to happen.  This movie was pure movie magic for me and I'm sure there will be another Superman movie in 2 to 3 years.  I can only hope that it can be just as captivating.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Fantastic writer. Cheryl wraps you up in her adventure and keeps you entertained along her physical and psychological journey. I really enjoyed it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is my husband's favorite trilogy! He loves the Blu-ray version especially because of the clarity which gives you a sense that you are right there with the action!
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Even after 40 years..they have the ability to come up with great new music! They are my all time favorites!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I am a certified sci-fi fan and this movie spoofs Star Trek and others while managing to be a watchable and lovable sci-fi movie in its own right. Those that love the original Star Trek series will find this enjoyable and humorous, and those that have never seen Star Trek will enjoy it also.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The book was well researched and well put together.  Each chapter in addition to telling a story, provided direct examples of how habits are created, their power, and the ability they have to transform individuals, corporations and even societies.  It is an engaging book about a topic that affects every one of us.  Definitely a 5 star for me.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|The excitement and plot lines of the first two seasons are largely gone now.  It is mostly about gore and special effects instead of substance.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great game. No issues. Great game to play during down time OR need to pass time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes you have to wait if you run out of moves or use money.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This main characters of this incredible story are a 17 year old foster child in Maine and a 91 year old woman who traveled west on an orphan train. The teen gets the woman to speak about her early life as she never has before.<br />I am amazed that I knew nothing about orphan trains which brought over 100,000 orphaned and neglected children from New York City to work on farms in the Midwest. A piece of American history that has been thoroughly unexplored.  I decided to look further into this piece of history (yep, I googled) and found that there was a musical made about this experience.  It premiered in Grand Central Station in October and then toured cities in the American heartland.  How appropriate!
B00F0JHEU0|5.0|For Doors fans like myself, who has collected everything The Doors since 1967, you will be thrilled with the release of The Doors R-Evolution! What is shown here for pre-order, is the U.K. release of this fantastic Blu-ray Deluxe Edition Set. The North American release will be on January 21, 2014.<br /><br />This fantastic Doors history of their television appearances is being released in 4 different formats in both Europe and North America. For the European market version, which is shown here- being released earlier than the North American versions- you can choose from a Deluxe Set in either Blu-ray or regular dvd. The Deluxe Set includes a fantastic 40 page book that features a scrap book style presentation of each track including the song lyrics, photos, background information and trivia. This Deluxe Book Set comes in your choice of the Blu-ray or dvd versions. There will also be just the Blu-ray or dvd R-Evolution without the book for less money.<br /><br />I'm certain many Doors fans, like myself, have seen some of The Doors television appearances over the years- even The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Television Show- Season 3 dvd includes a couple of The Doors appearances, but nothing like what is included here on this set. This is not a complete history, as you will notice not every television performance or film is included, as I immediately noticed The Doors second song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour- Wild Child is not included, nor the famous Light My Fire from The Ed Sullivan Show. This is a history of The Doors Evolution on film appearances, as the title states, and not a complete history. Just seeing the Evolution of The Doors on film is wonderful enough, but it's the Bonus Material that make this worth watching. Included in this set are some very rare television appearances of The Doors, such as the band's full performance on Shebang, a Dick Clark interview, the color version of the band's appearance on Malibu U- including never before seen outtakes, and from German tv- the complete color version of Hello, I Love You. Besides television appearances over the years, you will also get to enjoy The Doors Films from the 80's, including a rare director's cut of the 1985 L.A.Woman short film.<br /><br />There are Bonus Features that are simply fantastic as well. A new edit by Murray Lerner from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival is included, as well as the extremely rare 1966 Ford Motor Company film with The Doors providing the sound track. All the audio, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company film, has been restored by Bruce Botnick- The Doors long time engineer and co-producer of the last L.A. Woman album. There are 19 total television appearances and short films included on this simply fantastic set. Not only are the audios restored by Bruce Botnick, but I heard the videos have been restored fantastically as well!<br /><br />Having these television appearances of The Doors finally complete with great audio and video restorations is a wish come true. My only other wish is that someone restores the Jim Morrison Highway film as well as The Doors Feast Of Friends film. I've waited decades for a good copy of these great short films and I really hope someone will bring them to dvd and hopefully Blu-ray soon for all of us Doors and Jim Morrison fans to enjoy as much as these television appearances! For now, I have to give a million THANKS to Eagle Rock Studios for all their hard work in bringing us Doors fans these fabulous television appearances and rarities- these are all MUST-HAVES for us Doors and Jim Morrison Fans!<br /><br />Here are all 19 appearances and films included, and of course, the 40 page book is only included in the Deluxe Version.<br />01.)

B0013TTLDE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Since I loved The Secret Keeper, I realized I needed to read more by Kate Morton.  This was another great story.  I pictured myself in Downtown Abbey.  It's the tale of an elderly woman looking back at her life and secrets kept while a house maid in an English manor house.  Cannot wait to read another Kate Morton novel.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|SPOILER-ISH ALERT**** Veronica Roth's style changes in this book. In the beginning, you can tell it is forced, but as the story progresses, she becomes more familiar and the style becomes more natural. She truly masters character development in this final novel. In the end, you will understand why the style had to change. You must read this, but I warn you - you will have a SEVERE book hangover once you're done. It took me weeks to begin a new series!
B001G70M6S|5.0|Awesome. I hope they never take this film off the market. It is exceptional. I use it on my old Polaroid land camera. I get flawless results all the time. Thank you Fuji for your making this film. Keep it up.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love this show! Try and watch it every season. Need to get the season combo pack when it come out!
B002C39TU0|5.0|This is the best Smiths album in my opinion. This vinyl edition of it is darn good. The sonic clarity is outstanding. My only other album that sounds as good is my remastered of The Beatles White Album.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|Your basic fling rock into objects to destroy them game, Sort of like Crush The Castle. However, The controls are rather awkward and far more frustrating than good. It really takes away from the game as a whole and that is why I wouldn't recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's pertinent and poignant for the target audience, but, every parent and grandparent should read it. Our book club, Bookers, with our 70+ members, has chosen it for our May read. The characters are drawn with middle schoolers in mind so they are not as deep or flawed as we are used to in an &#34;adult&#34; read - the good are all good and the evil are all evil - however, this doesn't get in the way of the message. It's well written and incredibly funny in the voice of Auggie. It was recommended to us by the ten-year old granddaughter of one of our members. Olivia also has wisdom beyond her years.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Chances of winning are slim. There can be 172 cards playing and only 29 available bingos. Frustrating. There are better Bingo games out there.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A magical journey is in store for anyone who reads this incredible novel. It touches your heart with every emotion imaginable! It's one of those novels you can laugh and cry in the same sentence. Tender, words that deliver you to the place the author wants you to be. Our book club, Bookers, (70+ members) selected it for our October, 2013 read and the only complaint we heard was that the ending was too abrupt...they wanted the family to sit down and have a nice supper together.
B001152TL6|5.0|Everything worked out perfectly - The movie came quickly - undamaged - and played perfectly - I was and am so happy to own it - Thank You! :)
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is an incredibly well written series with everything yyou could want in a fantasy novel.  The characters are real and dynamic, the lives are believable and tragic, and the story is one you can't put down. Thanks George.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books, and I love Christian :)<br />They keep you wanting more....they have romance, intrigue, suspence, everything you want in a good story.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|This is the most enchanting music, written by Natalie Merchant over a long period of time, for her young daughter--The lyrics all come from poetry written for children and nursery rhymes. As a grandmother, I've enjoyed reading this sort of literature to my children and grandchildren for a long time, but Merchant's amazing musical talents add tremendously to that enjoyment.  I like to give it as a gift to young families and first time parents.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I don't care about the people who say this game has problems if you would've gotten the update Rarity only cost 1000 coin bits.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good, brilliant movie. It kept me guessing and entertained. I would recommend this movie to others. I would watch it again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book. All of his books are so good will buy the next one soon.  Very touching. Great, great,greabook<br />Enjoyed the ending
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I absolutely loved the first two books in this series and couldn't wait for Allegiant to come out.  I was really disappointed with Allegiant - the plot was boring, there were several threads that were introduced that really weren't addressed, and then I hated the ending - it was pointless for it to end the way it did.  Spoiler ALERT:  Really hard to believe that a historically evil character would just have a 180 degree turn just because someone asked her too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE this show! It's so easy to get involved with the characters - to laugh, to cry, to worry over them! :)
B000S1L7IU|4.0|Very interesting thr way the stories were tied together. While swami liar to his other sit was a &#34; google&#34; story
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I chose this rating because it was such a dramatic twist to it. I cried over and over about how Conner and Alex would never see each other again because of the portal closing forever. All I have to really say is that there bettered be a book 3 and 4.Chris Colfer is such an amazing author that it literally breaks my  heart that this could  his most amazing book ever yet it could also be the last
B000T9QF8S|5.0|The performance of Beethoven's Symphonies by Georg Solti is simply beautiful and irresistible!  I strongly recommend this box set of Beethoven Symphonies to Beethoven's music lovers.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is a very addicting game.  It probably isn't family friendly and only for mature audiences, but my husband and I love it.  WE play it and keep competing for a  higher score.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Lot of interesting stories its always fun to root for the underdogs. Not quite as good as his other books but definitely worth the read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is an outstanding and compelling novel. There are surprises along the way and it provides food for thought too.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|I got this as TFotD.  Havnt played much of it until a few minutes ago.  Its great for a quick jolt to the old thinker.  Simple graphics and gameplay is what really wins here.
0440418569|5.0|Wonderful story. Makes the reader aware of the power of religious organizations. It's a pity the first movie didn't get sequels. I wish all and parents kids will read the three volumes  (see also The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife).
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This well written sci-fi/western takes unexpected turns, makes you think, makes you laugh, and pulls you in to want to know more about the characters.  It's truly a shame that it was only given a one season run.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Super disappointed in this book. I loved the first two books, and they set up for a potentially great third book. Unfortunately, the story flopped. What lies outside of the fence lacks imagination. I couldn't tell if I was reading from tris' pov or tobias' pov because they did not have a distinguished &#34;voice&#34;. Definitely not whay I was expecting from the author. I would recommend reading book 1 and 2 and leaving the rest up to your own imagination.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It has issues. If it was refurbished it was not done well. I play Word games and after my move it often goes back to the carousel. Sometimes the ad comes in and flashes at a super high rate. It definitely feels used....
B00BD99JMW|3.0|the middle was awful, great surprise ending that I didn't see coming. A bit mellow dramatic but then again it is YA.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Excellent acting, poignant story. It seems Maggie Smith can do anything! The cast contained actual aging opera stares and was based on their lives
1452105111|5.0|These are adorable. There were the perfect amount of letters and it was straightforward to assemble the message I wanted.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Great re-make of a classic that provides a clear insight into the soul of the character and the score by Hans Zimmer is epic
B004HMNQQM|5.0|This story is so captivating unfolding at just the right pace. The cinematography is beautiful. I loved the characters - Gere and Foster great in their roles.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This is a cruder copycat version of 50 Shades of Grey.  Young, gorgeous, self made, tormented  billionaire is drawn to young unsuspecting beauty.  If you liked 50 shades, this story is lacking the playful banter between the characters that I was drawn to.  This series definitely takes on the same themes in 50 shades and the author does put  her own spin on it.  Although it is full of sex scenes, it is not as well written as reads more crude than passionate.<br /><br />Although I would rate this series as a copy cat of 50 Shades, at the end of the day, I did really like the characters.  Gideon is deeply passionate and protective of Eva.  Eva is a survivor of abuse trying to find some normalcy within a relationship but owns her own emotional issues.  The supporting characters of her parents and best friend are very likeable and do add to make this a more well rounded story.<br /><br />Overall, it you want to read something as a follow up to 50 Shades, this will suffice, just know that the bar has been lowered.
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time !!!!! Can't wait for DVD  release to watch again....
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love fairy tales, since they are always so full of hidden meanings and symbols. Many are actually coming of age stories as well. This story is also a combination coming of age/fairy tale.<br />But it's definitely for adults.<br />I was so impressed by the descriptions of scenery, characters and situations. Ursula was really scary-she reminded me of my fourth grade teacher. It was very easy to picture this story in my mind. Curiously, I saw it in panels, as if it was a graphic novel.<br />I loved the point made by old Mrs. Hempstock: that everyone remembers things differently, and then the narrator wasn't even sure he remembered his story properly. There is so much to see in this short book. I guess I'll have to read it again and again to find more that I missed. Darn!
B00ARN0XGG|5.0|Pretty scary but expected, this was basically like all the others but not as scary as the first two. Better watch them all together
B0000TB01Y|5.0|if you loved Wicked, how can you not love the sound track! It is great and so nice to have the lyrics. Wonderful listening and singing along! Even if you can't sing!
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|Costs more with in app purchases not worth it stupid game and cost parents a small fortune no good stupid annoying!!<br /> Don't bother
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Not a light read for sure. I was not totally  taken with the book, but some in book group were. All subjective !
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This was required for school. The book came quickly and in good condition. I'd order again from this seller confidently.
B00013F35I|5.0|One of the best video concerts of all time. Bruce and the E Street Band are at their best. This concert includes songs from &#34;The Rising&#34; and the crowd in Barcelona was great. I only wish I could have been there in person.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|White Fire opens with a prologue set in London in 1889. Oscar Wilde tells Arthur Conan Doyle a story  he had heard in America so horrible that Doyle immediately feels compelled to leave.<br /><br /> In the present, Corrie,  Pendergast’s young  protégé and Criminology student has stumbled upon the perfect tale for her thesis. Roaring Fork, an uber-rich ski resort in Colorado, has moved a century-old graveyard to make way for a new development. Among the uncovered bones are those of some miners which appear to have been eaten by a grizzly.  However, Corrie may have bitten off more than she can chew as her investigation takes her in some rather unanticipated directions which soon land her in jail. In desperation, she contacts Pendergast for help.  He arrives in the town just as the first of a series of brutal arsonist attacks occurs. Soon, it becomes apparent to Pendergast that these crimes are linked to the attacks against the miners a century earlier and, with a winter storm setting in, things are about to get much, much worse.<br /><br />White Fire has to be one of the best, most kick-ass, certainly the most delicious edition to the Pendergast series yet. For anyone who believes that the series was losing its edge, this will definitely revive your faith in it and, for anyone who has never read the series, White Fire will definitely whet your appetite for more.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|One of the best science fiction films ever made. Rarely does a film get made after the television series that predates it gets cancelled by network executives who where obviously morons.
0385535139|4.0|Grisham writes my kind of stories.  his creativity and suspense keep me engaged.  he writes thrilling books without use of profanity or inappropriate sexual language.  I appreciate not being violated by the text, and providing interesting storylines.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a awesome and challenging. and really fun and addicting it also I very boring if you play it way to much but that almost never happens
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Another informational saga of the history of Star Trek.......keep them coming.  This is a never ending story....... who likes a great story that ends ?
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Korn, and I absolutely LOVE everything they do! They can never disappoint! And the CD/DVD Deluxe I ordered was in excellent condition and plays perfectly.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed the ride this author took me on. The story kept me guessing, and the characters were great!
B005SDMDRW|4.0|Another great Michael Connelly mystery. I have read many of his books and this one is up with the others.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. cheryl was very courageous and determined. what a way to 'find' yourself. very inspiring !
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Written in the first person, this story tells of a big dog that was stolen and forced into a dog sled team. After many set backs he becomes the leader of the team
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love this show thank ypu so much for offering this to the public i would be lost with out it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Big and bold w/ good colour contrast for ease of use. Does exactly what I needed to do for the task.
0307720748|5.0|Bravissimo. Branson's story is epic in every sense of the word. From the first page you are led on a suspenseful and gripping adventure. I've never felt this excited to flip to the next page when reading a biography. If you are looking for an adventure pick this up, if you are looking for a detailed history of Virgin pick this up, and most importantly if you are looking to be inspired to live life to the fullest extent don't hesitate to... yea you guessed it... pick this up. I am a biography geek and have read every great businessman from Ben Franklin to Warren Buffet but nothing has taken me on such a ride as 'Losing My Virginity' did. And I mean that in both ways, but I'm mostly talking about this book. READ IT.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I was hooked after watching about 3 episodes of Breaking Bad.<br /><br />This TV show will keep you on the edge, but it's got some pretty graphic material. Not for the faint of heart!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season.  I have just watched all 3 seasons together - when will the fourth be on line? Interesting story lines and unexpected climaxes.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I'm addicted to this series.  I just started watching within the last few weeks and I am now up to the current season.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|You should not be allowed to write such amazing well developed books to just slaughter the last book entirely. I was ruined and disappointed to learn what was beyond the fence. That was it the big secret? All this about ruined genes and social experiments. SPOILER......the death in the end was kind of expected because honestly how many times can you elude death....BUT seriously doesn't mean she had to die....but it makes the book that much more awful.....I am left depressed And disappointed...
B00DYESRZY|4.0|Each track is solid on its own. Together makes a nice 'album'. Slow Focus is a change from most current releases.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The ending was terrible!!  The last eight chapters felt like the author got tired and just decided to &#34;wrap it up&#34;.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I never jumped so much in my life.. my heart was in my throat. Scarieatr movie I've seen in a while, and I don't scare easily
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This story was compelling and beautifully written.  The reader genuinely feels Theo's struggles as he attempts to make sense of life's jarring events and moral ambiguities.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Luv luv luv walking dead.. learnin much needed skills for thr impending zombie apocalypse ;) I will survive all this
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was so disappointing.  Not only was it not written well, the plot was horrible.  I loved the first two books.  I don't understand what happened to the author when she was writing the last book in the trilogy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I did not expect stiff to eliminate herself on account of sacrificial love. It was very challenging but felt like ms Roth rushed it along.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|The book is focusing on basics and guiding you on how to start the process of learning anything FAST, but fast here doesn't mean that you are not going to spend some of your precious time in the process, it intend to guide you towards a very efficient process.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is one of those books that I couldn't stop reading.  Fascinating and helpful.  I've already changed a few habits of my own.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book it's an eye opener.  I have been putting in action many of the advice that are mentioned in this book and I am more than thankful to my mother-in-law that she was the one that introduce me to the secret.  Now I know that any action I could turn it to be a positive one by controlling my thoughts.
1451613520|4.0|Made me aware of warning from President Eisenhower how the economic power brokers actually can guide direction our political<br />representation.  90+% of population saying Henry Wallace, as selection for Vice President with President Roosevelt's Fourth Term,<br />yet complete reversal yielding Harry Truman.<br />Age Four left me non-committal on that election.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|very well researched and a great read but a bit silly in parts- I'm not a prude, far from it but the masturbation parts were a bit silly I felt
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Being a private pilot, as it relates to aviation, it is all possiable. Years ago the Boeing MD-80 have the similar problem which caused this fictional story. The film so the depths of addiction and the ugly side of drug and achochal. It dives deeper into how company's and people do things for there personal betterment.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you love these books you have to read this fifth book. If you've never read these before, then don't read this one first. If you are debating on whether to buy this one after reading the others in quick succession, I would suggest taking a break and returning to the series as I get a little bored with it when I read back to back
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the series and this book did not disappoint. Questions are answered. It was a fitting end to the series. We continue to feel the struggles between Tobias and Tris as well as several other tense relationships.
B00EMGUR60|4.0|Better than the last 2 albums for sure.<br />Good songs Good Sound!<br />I like &#34;Lost Woman Blues&#34; best<br />Lemmy is God!
B00EJ2WBX4|3.0|i previewed the rest of the album. This is an OK song and probably the best one on the record. What kills me from buying the rest of the album is the fact that it sounds too much like Goldfrapp's worst work HEAD FIRST. I feel like I got thrown back into the never ending story. I'm all about 80's pop when its done right (e.g. Mika), but it seems like the only twist on the actual album is making it more modern introducing bass driven drones that most of HEAD FIRST lacked. I'm also all about bass driven beats, I just felt like it was too Cindy Loper/early Madonna and then shadowed w/ dubbish-step.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the 2nd book the. Hunger games more drama more fights you'll  love it too enjoy you'll read<br />Can't wait  for the next installment .
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|This was the Superman movie I had been waiting for since I was a child.  Growing up Superman was my absolute favorite hero, not only because of his tremendous power - but also because of his compassion and morality; traits I identified as valuable and heroic even at a very young age.  More than just a reboot, and more than just mindless action - &#34;Man Of Steel&#34; brings Superman into the modern era with force and gravity that respect the character and lend strength to the story we all know.  The acting is wonderful, the smirks and glances shared between Cavill and Adams communicates the growing interest and intimacy between Clark and Lois.  Kevin Costner as Johnathan Kent offers an incredible performance full of emotion and strength that reminded me of the best qualities of my own father whom I had lost many years ago.  A couple of his scenes actually made the room seem a little dusty.  And, of course, Russel Crowe makes Jor El more than just a floating head in a crystal cavern, he makes the character legendary and leaves you hoping to see much more of him in future films of the franchise.  The casting in general is superb and I didn't walk away thinking anyone failed in their performance.  The effects are extremely well done, while there is (of course) lots of CGI in the film, it doesn't feel overwhelming but instead fits very well with the grand scale of events in the movie.  The writing was well done, many reboots belabor the telling of the origins story to a point that makes long time fans impatient - not so in this movie.  A different take and new offerings on the same old Son of Krypton make the telling fresh and interesting.<br />I have noted a lot of criticism of the movie; trashing it as over the top or doing injustice to the character of Superman.  I offer this to those who have not seen the movie yet because of such remarks; Christopher Reeves' Superman was legendary (and was single handedly responsible for my fandom) yet in modern culture he wouldn't have done well at all.  The story in this movie, the way it is handled, even the costume modifications are all essential for making Superman relevant and viable in the 21st century.<br />Watch the movie, and enjoy - that's all there is to it!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I like the old Robert Redford version...tragic as it was. Way too much hoopla regarding this version...it could only lead to disappointment.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I didn't like this book. It was too technical for me to follow.<br />I was bored by information that I couldn't understand.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Same as above. No complaints. They own prime time hands down.Worth getting the series if you have time and money.
0375842209|5.0|Best book I've read in ages, and to think it was written for young people!  I belong to a book club and most of the books we've read in the last few years have been boring or very predictable.  It takes a chapter to figure out what's up with the writing and after that I was grabbed.  Turned down going to the movie as feared I'd be disappointed; maybe later.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I've followed this series from the beginning, and I think the interaction among the characters is extremely well developed and interesting. The story lines can be predictable, but there is always a personal twist among the characters that makes it interesting, and even funny.
B003DWU98U|5.0|My husband introduced me to this movie and i'm so glad he did.  It occurred to me that this is the kind of movie that would win awards even now.  The scene in the bar was amazing and it reminded me of something Quentin Tarantino would do in a movie, although to be accurate, this is probably something he was inspired by.  The vibe was great.  Definitely recommend this.
B00933JL0A|5.0|It reminds me of Majesty. A great, relaxing, Castle based strategy/society building game. I have only been playing for a couple days and can already tell that I am going to spend too much time on it. It is not a difficult game but quite enjoyable for those of us that love slowly building a settlement and watching how it unfolds. It can be a little slow at times but that is what makes it a relaxing app.
B008Y7IINM|5.0|Great for sci-fi viewers.  Well acted and directed.  One of the first &#34;reality isn't real&#34; movies.  Good concept that is well executed!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is an amazing book! I can't put it down and can't wait to get through all three books! Love it!
B000TGJ8F8|5.0|Nicolas Cage is extremely believable in this movie.  Another mind bender with great acting and directing.  One of my favorite movies of all time.
B006LSZECO|2.0|With the great ratings this book received, I thought this was going to be a great read.  Very predictable & I could not wait to be finished with it.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I will start by saying that I couldn't even finish this book. That's an extremely rare occurrence for me. The premise of the book is that one social media company, the Circle, has taken over all social media, internet advertising, and sales. The protagonist Mae, works for this company. This book is a thinly veiled lecture on how we need to be less engaged online and protect our privacy better. Unfortunately, to get this point across, the author essentially makes Mae into a robot who blindly follows orders without thinking or feeling. Any reasonable person would have seen warning signs about why her behavior and her companions were unhealthy. But then the author couldn't get his scare tactics across that social media is ruining society and the human race. Boring characters, implausible storyline, and nothing in the prose to make up for those two.
B00E9A656K|4.0|The title speaks for itself! Ive never liked drag racing games before, but this one will get you hooked! Definitely a game worth playing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ahh Stephen king is back to writing good novels again. This book is worth the money it cost to purchase!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! I can't wait to finish the last book. I only wish that katniss and peeta shared more love scenes.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Having played magic for a number of years, seeing the latest iteration of their introductory series for free on a kindle is simply marvellous. Due to the large size of the file it took longer than average to download, but content was superb. My only complaint is in regard to the general speed of the game as matches take longer than I would expect. A strong recommendation for newcomers and veterans alike.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoyed this game and it is very challenging which I love. Great game to play and good exercise for the brain.
0307743659|5.0|Page turner...I needed a refresher before I read the sequel. Could not put it down. Really enjoyed this book... now
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|I enjoyed I Am Malala and the way Malala wrote her book. It shows that in Pakistan, as in the U.S. there are differences in how each person views their country and its political policies. Sometimes we are led to believe that the Taliban was welcome and embraced by the whole Muslim world, and this book is a great example of the fact that this is not the case.  She is obviously passionate about trying to make her country a place where girls can be educated and not oppressed.<br />My only complaint is that often it seemed a story about her father more so than herself. But he was her greatest support and with her throughout the process, so I understand the reasons behind it.<br /> Malala is a strong female and her way of voicing opinions and speaking of herself may at times seem as though she is conceited, but I think that's just another example of the cultural differences and shouldn't deter anyone from reading the book.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Love game but hard naveagate to up grade wepeaons.or how to do it.hard to figure out how many credits you have.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|James Clavell, RIP, is and probably always will be my all time favorite author. I read a lot, historical fiction, military fiction, thrillers, mysteries, classics, fantasy. I have read everyone in these genres, from Dickens to Herbert, and Clancy to Doyle. Clavell by far reaches me the most deeply, and I find all of his books gripping and addicting (except maybe Whirlwind), and as all good authors do, he always leaves me wanting more at the end.<br /><br />Shogun is a stunningly epic and LONG novel, yet even on my 4th reading over the summer, I could not put it down and had to force myself to lay it down and sleep lest the night just go all the way by.<br /><br />You will remember this book all the rest of your life possibly, and you will come to an understanding of the Japanese way of life that will open your eyes to many things that have occurred in history.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|My my complaint s that I'm ready to see more pictures and the upgrades aren't ready yet. This is an awesome game! I can play it for hours on end!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is a pretty good read, even though it goes through familiar territory. Many authors like to go back to their beginning after being successful and Grisham finds this appealing in this book; because he finds it so, so will the reader. No disappointments here - a great book that will still make you shake your head at how recently these things could have occurred.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I'm so surprised by all of the negative reviews - this was hands-down my favorite of the three Bridget books.  I laughed harder, cried my butt off, and was more moved by this book than either of the other two (though I loved them both as well).  There is definitely a major plot element that turns things on their head - beware reading reviews or it'll likely be spoiled, but even so, it's quite obvious within the first couple chapters.  But I felt it gave the story a grounding and a darkness that the other two books lacked - and made the humor funnier.  And it made the messiness more understandable.<br /><br />The ending felt a little simple, in a rom-com sort of way, but it didn't diminish the joy of hanging out again with such a wonderfully flawed -transparently so!- character I've loved for so long.<br /><br />I was literally howling with laughter this weekend reading it on a plane and on the beach - and then crying minutes later.  I looked like a loon.  But it was such a wonderful story.  Don't let all the negative comments turn you off.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|How can you not like these classics especially at the Kindle price??? The answer is &#34;You can't&#34;. Great old English style writing that gives a pretty cool historical glimpse into how life was in those days in England as well as the fascinating Homes mysteries and Moriarty story.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|All shooting and fisticuffs.  Uninteresting predictable plot.  The original bonds were much more sophisticated and intriguing.  The latest Bonds are all shoot-em-ups and fist fights, with a little sex salsa topping.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Although she expansively supports her arguments and each experiment is a stepping stone to the next. But not one of them worked for me and I really wanted them to, I really did, I even redid them hoping for a different result.<br /><br />Included in each experiment plan the author adds that if it doesn't work you can stop. This left me feeling the author wasn't sure if it works.<br /><br />That said, I believe a positive mindset is always a good thing and that is the one thing that the book left me with.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This film just didn't have it. For a Disney film it was beyond flat. They don't miss very often but when the do, it's big. The acting was dull, the scenery fake. It just didn't do anything for me. Very disappointed.
157421327X|1.0|If I had known this was more of a pamphlet than a book, I would never have ordered it.  very disappointed
B00519YRH2|4.0|Great Tom Hanks classic. I enjoyed watching it again with my kids. It takes you back in time to your younger days.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Sentinel is the conclusion of the Covenant series.<br /><br />It is the time to fight for what you believe in.  Lives are at risk and not everyone will survive. Alex knows she has to be the one to confront evil but she is struggling with what happened to her in Appollyon. She seems very human instead of the all powerful being, which made me like her even more. Aiden is there for her every step of the way. His support, his loyalty and his love is unconditional.<br /><br />I read Sentinel very slowly because I didn't want it to end. I cherished this book.  I LUV Aiden and Alex. I love Seth too and I'm so happy that Jennifer didn't mess him up. From the first page I was smiling (nobody does humor like this author). All her books crack me up but they also make me cry.<br />This book was not the exception.<br /><br />The end left me wanting for more.  I wanna see more of Aiden and Alex but I want to see more Seth.  I hope Seth gets his own series.  The poor guy needs to find love too.  He is very redeemable and I love his humor.<br />I also think Apollo rocks but he does need a bell around his neck. Seriously.<br /><br />If you haven't read this series and you enjoy some UF/PNR then start right away. Even if you don't enjoy the genre it is completely worth it IMO.<br />I'm a huge fan of JLA and she is a must read for me.<br />I just wish someone will make the movie (please someone make it). It's very hard to say goodbye. At least we still have Opposition coming out next year (Daemon Black!!!).<br /><br />“Okay, can we move on to the important stuff?” I demanded, losing my patience. “If not, then this is wasting my time, and I’m going to bed. That just might include irresponsible sex, because I’ve had a really crappy day!”<br /><br />5 strong Fangs
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hello my name is sky I have my own minecraft videos on my youtube channel, and I think this is just as good as minecraft for pc. This game is the best for everyone, and the best thing about this game is there's no specific goal or end point it's fun for everyone!
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|Amazing HD transfer for this movie, forget Dvds and VHS. If you have the chance, get this steelbook, it looks wonderful.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played and it's perfect for the kindle I strongly recommend this game and for a great price!
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|Great transfer and beautiful steelbook. Fans of the first movie will be pleased with this product, it has all the extras included in previous editions and a very good looking packaging.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie again after it first came out over a decade ago.  The Amazon streaming video is robust, with great video as well as audio.  It lets you pick up where you left off if you can't view the entire movie in one sitting.
B00C7E3EFU|4.0|Good packaging, with a double cover featuring the original poster of the movie, tons of extra and a HD transfer supervised by Dean Cundey himself. So, maybe we won't get a 10/10 video out of this film because of its rough nature, but this blu-ray is a must have for Carpenter fans.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging yet not too hard. Great game to pass some time with, or get completely lost in! I also love the fact you can play the same game on many devices.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game was so awesome. Their is no better angry bird game yet. I can not wait for angry birds star wars 2. Peace out.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I could never get into this book for some reason. So when the movie came out and my brother said &#34;I just had to watch it.&#34; I was pretty skeptical. But after watching this, I instantly feel in love. Such an amazing movie, I went back and read the book!! I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed!! A must see you won't regret it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The storyteller was such a surprise I had to 're-read the beginning twice to make sure my impression was accurate. The style and descriptive wording was refreshingly unusual.  I know this is now a movie, but I don't see how any director can evoke an atmosphere of understanding without the words that are written in this book. It was hard to get anything done while reading this book since I never wanted to put it down.  If you love to read- this is the story for you.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I am a Johnny Depp fan. Any movie he's in I have to watch so when I found this movie I was esstatic! This is definitely a movie I could watch over and over again!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I love this movie so much! It came on time, and I only paid 10 bucks because I waited for the price to go down and it was only down for a day.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great game get to cook different things at once real life you can't really manage to do that<br />Great game for all ages
B000FC12YQ|4.0|This is the first Agatha Christie book I have read.  Fun escapism and while something kept nagging at my brain, which I could not put my finger on, the ending caught me off guard.
B000002VMH|5.0|The antidote to Miley! This came out years ago and still sounds fresh. A must have for any 90's collection.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I consider TV to be brain candy...so if I'm going to watch...I want it to be the best candy money can buy!
B004XWLN20|3.0|I started watching Smallville about season 7, so I wanted to see it from the beginning. I bought this a few days ago and started watching it yesterday. I'm just on disc 4, but there is already several spots where the sound just stops for about 2 seconds and restarts. The packing is very tight as mentioned in previous posts, but it's manageable. Season 1 is not HD quality. We'll see about the others.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Great game, just like the call of Atlantis, keeps you interested.  You have the challenging levels just like the Call of Atlantis!!!!
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|A scary look at an evil man and how he became and thought like he did! If you want to know about the man who almost took over the world read this book and thank goodness he failed.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|It is an awesone app.I can send picrures from my phone/camera and they are at home when I get there.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Easily the best book I've come across in this genre.  Completely original and lives up to its title.  This isn't a story following one group around, its a series of first person interviews from all over the world.  When its over you have a good sense of how the war played out in most of the world.  I will not soon forget the what happened below the streets in Paris; perhaps the most terrifying zombie sequence I've ever read.<br /><br />Brooks writes with complete authenticity, which is no easy feat when writing about zombies.  His characters are well drawn and behave in a completely believable way.  Most apocalyptic stories pull me out of my suspension of disbelief because the characters do and say things that are clearly only meant to move plot.  World War Z never once pulled me out of its world.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am currently reading this book for the 3rd time, every time I read it I seem to find something that I somehow missed on previous occasions. Makes you wonder what kind of research EL did for this book.  When I am reading this trilogy, I never get much sleep, can't put the books down.
0307346617|4.0|I have to admit this book was NOTHING like I expected it to be.  I began it looking for something resembling the movie which was a big disappointment.  When my daughter recommended it to me, I have to say I was more than reluctant to give it a try, but she has yet to steer me wrong, so with trepidation, I downloaded it to my kindle and promptly forgot about it.  It was months and many books later when I turned to the introduction.  Yes, you read that right...the introduction...and I was hooked.<br /><br />I'll freely admit I loved this book so much more than the movie with the same title, but then, I'll also admit the title is the only thing the book and the movie have in common...well besides Zombies and the fact that Israel built a wall.  I can imagine the producers of the movie having the following conversation with Mr. Brooks:<br /><br />  Producers: &#34;Mr. Brooks, we'd like to make a movie about zombies, and we love the title of your book.  We don't want our movie to be anything like your book, but we'd still like to use your title.  Would that be all right with you?&#34;<br />  Mr. Brooks: &#34;Sure, anything to boost sales.&#34;<br /><br />The narrator/organizer of this book does a great job of bring to life the horrors of the actual zombie war as it happened through the eyes of those who lived/fought/and survived it.  From the doctors who treated the people to the smugglers who helped the cross the borders to those dog handlers who helped win the war, we hear first hand accounts of what it was like during the ten years it took to reclaim the earth from the &#34;walking dead.&#34;<br /><br />All I've got to say is that I wish I read it sooner.
B000HF0J36|5.0|Fun filled shark movie with a lot of thrilling moments. Characters are well developed and there's a decent amount of background and world building that make this movie real without weighing it down.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great novel! Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down!! One of his better novels.Wow!! Very good! Wow
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love the strong, capable female lead.  The show is right on with legal issues that are very real today.
1451648537|5.0|One of the best books of the decade! This is a fascinating look inside the life and mind of Steve Jobs and how things work and happened in the history of Apple! I have been an Apple fan for quite some time and this is absolutely a wonderful and entertaining story! Highly recommended!
B00AKO93JK|1.0|Freezes up constantly and won't run through the workout. Videos are clear and easy to follow, the only issue is the freezing. This is on my kindle, may work better on a computer.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies!! A must see for everyone! So funny and entertaining. Watch over and over!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Death personna was too distraction.<br />It took me about half of the book to get into this story.  Didn't like so much the narration of the death figure.  Found it more distracting than contributing to the story, especially in the first half.  Once it started to taper off, I liked the story.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|This wonderful film documents the birth and development of all the great music that has been part of my life.  A must see for the over 60 group that spent a great deal of time listening to music. History was made at these recording studios by many of the great entertainers.<br /><br />Also something the younger crowd would like because this place had an influence on all the performers today in some small or large way.<br /><br />Turn up the volume, sit back and prepare yourself to be taught musical history and be entertained at the same time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was depressing through out. None of the characters were likable. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it helps to out I'm improve your critical thinking skills as you work on getting the colors lined up just right for the most points.
0395925037|5.0|This Book is just as relevant today as it was when it was penned by a political prisoner in the early 1920's about the sad state of affairs occurring in Germany at the time, and what needed to be done to rectify the situation. This book could have been written today concerning what is now happening in America, as well as every other white nation. War is Hell there is no denying that but as ant intelligent person knows, the winners write the history books. Hitler had no evil plan to exterminate the jews, The so called &#34;Final Solution&#34; was to have the jews removed from Germany so the German people could control their own destiny. Many jews died in concentration camps but not one was gassed to death because THERE WERE NO GAS CHAMBERS AT AUSHWITZ! An American death chamber expert traveled to the camp and inspected every inch of it, his conclusion? Zero chance that jews were gassed and incinerated at the camps. Zyklon B was a pesticide used to kill lice and vermin. Do your own research do not be scared to be labeled a racist. Truth Is Not Racism.
B002E2M5J6|5.0|Awesome to see them live. I have only been able to see them 1 in the US. now at least i was able to see them again live.<br />great quality.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw the preview for this movie, I was watching something on You Tube (again) and it clicked up. After that I spent the rest of the day with a big stupid grin on my face.<br />Happy to say 5 anxious months reading reviews, a trip to redbox, and TWO bug eyed hours in a dark room later I still have that grin. It's like being 5 on Saturday morning again!<br /><br />Its like some one mixed Godzilla (1998), Transformers, Jurassic Park, Day After Tomorrow, Tron: Legacy, and a bunch of giant mecha anime and sci-fi cartoons and made the worlds tastiest stir-fry! :)<br /> It's exactly as it was described, big, loud, wet, action-packed and squishy.... be prepared to see the squishy. :P  It's a typical PG-13 sci-fi movie; could've done without a lot of mentioned curse words and there are quite a few of nose bleeds but in my opinion the only gore-gore is what happens to the kaiju. On another note, I like how they based it in China and had references to Japan (that is where it all started anyway), very cool. It is long but I read somewhere that it was to be longer so they could describe the characters in more detail. ({Awww Mr. Toro!!! I wouldn't have minded!}) But it's fine where they cut it in my unprofessional opinion.<br />My favorite characters are Newton the &#34;kaiju groupie&#34; scientist(he's crazy), Crimson Typhoon (and his triplets), Mako Mori, Gypsy Danger (of course!) and the flying kaiju .<br />Overall, cool movie. I wish there were more original movies like this instead of overused remakes/reboots and stale storylines.... Hmmm, this flick may have just earned a place on my shelf. :)<br /><br />PS: (sorry, I had to mention this)<br />Mr.Pentecost:) ONE: don't you ever touch me again. TWO: don't you ever touch me again.
B007C94XG4|4.0|KIds loved the alvin and the chipmunks series. Good, clean family fun. Easy for parents to watch too, which is nice.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Fast paced, well done. Keeps you guessing. With this book, I've read everything. Can't wait for spring and the next way of kings book!  Please write a sequel to this one as well.
B003ZSH606|5.0|While not their best album, still a great album. Some cool tunes almost like the old school space cowboy album.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Different type of story. Book club read it and Everyone (14) loved it. Not one single negative comment. Would recommend to all readers.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|This is on ok wipe holder. Probably a little fancier than it needs to be. We ended up using a more straight forward one the fits into our babies fold up change area.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Pretty fast pace and interesting story. It had several plot twists and surprises. Alternative take on super powers that made me keep wanting to read to understand how the super powers came to be.
B0060CRM6M|4.0|Kids liked chicken little. She's 3 and it took here a little while to get into the story, but now she really likes it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The computer generated graphics are outstanding. This story line cleared up the questions raised during the original Kahn movie of a few years ago. I have been a treky since the first Star Trek movie, even before Cap't Kirk. and have enjoyed each episode. Technologically, &#34;Into Darkness&#34; surpasses anything the early writers could have dreamed of in the early days. From that stand point, this could rate five stars, but I never rate a movie five stars.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Took me a little while to get into it (I generally love Joss Whedon... but I generally hate outer-space sci-fi...) but OF COURSE I was won over in the end. Simon *swoon*
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|My Wife saw the movie and every other woman I have ever talked to loves it.  If you like musicals, this is the movie for you.  The music is great of course because the songs are all original ABBA hits.  The women also LOVE Meryl and Pierce.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Very different from what I expected. Well made movie and well acted. Brad Pitt's character - interesting - an UN investigator - didn't know they had that much clout and authority. Overall, good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the first book, I was wondering how will the story continue? Will it be as fascinating as the first book? Will I be as enthusiastic about Catching Fire as I was about the Hunger Games?<br />The answer is: Surely YES!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very unique and involving way the story developed.  Keep me interested an coming back fro more, but I thought the ending was weak.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book in the Hunger Games series, the one that ends it all. As we are already accustomed, the book keeps your attention so powerfully, you start to realize you are starting to think like Katniss Everdeen.<br />Although, the best part about this book is how it ends! Truly unexpected!!!
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Good action packed movie.  Once the movie got going it keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Good movie
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book since I finished book one and two. I lost track of some of the characters over time so it took a while to get back into the book. I was disappointed in the book because I didn't think the author developed the story line very well. I didn't feel like the book answered a lot of questions that were being led up to after book two. Amnity had all the green houses and I felt there were answers there that were never explored. The whole issue about genetic modification seems to be just skimmed over. The only thing that I felt gave closure in the book was Tris. The book was predictable in the sense that Tris would sacrifice herself for what she thought was right.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Entertaining and scary movie. Well done, and great twist. Would recommend for day time viewing if you are scared easily.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|loved this - Nick Hornby always makes me laugh, his books are so feel-good and I love his tragic, flawed but lovable male characters! been too busy to read novels recently so this Kindle Single gave me my Hornby Hit without investing the time in one of his full-length books (which are also very good by the way).
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Perfect mix of everything. Endearing yet powerful and dark at times with a pinch of humor. Not your everyday World War II story told from a new perspective. Can't stop reading. Can't wait too see if the movie lives up to the book.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|My cousin gave me the first book in this series a couple of years ago and the only thing I thought was &#34;Really? That kid from Glee is writing books?&#34; After reading the Land of Stories, I was truly amazed at how good the storyline was, especially since Chris Colfer wrote it when he was in 8th grade. The second book is just as good as the first. As long as you're looking for a short, light read and not this generation's Shakespeare, you'll enjoy this book immensley.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush on my kindle! it has alot of different rounds, fast paced and keeps my interest!
B005SCSL56|5.0|I was given this book as a gift. My first reaction was &#34;Great. Another 'star' that thinks they can write.&#34; I was pleasantly surprised to find out that not only does Chris Colfer have real talent, he wrote this when he was in the 8th grade!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is great I am so glad that I decided to give it a try, I am now watching every season.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I LOVE Allie Brosh. I follow her blog religiously, even through her 18 month hiatus while she fought crippling depression. The only complaint I have about this book is that it is too short. I can never get enough of her writing! If you like Jenny Lawson (TheBloggess), you'll love Allie.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I was really hoping this movie would be good, i mentally prepared myself for it to be bad, and when i saw the first reviews, i was excitation.<br /><br />It's big, it's fun, and it isn't into itself, meaning it isn't trying to be anything that it's not. You grab a huge bucket of popcorn and set your brain to fun awesome mode.<br /><br />The filmmakers had a great attention to detail, the mechanics of things were about as believable as you might imagine them to be, unlike transformers mechanics, which are just silly as hell. The only thing i looked at negatively was that they use helicopters to lift these robots... yea i don't think so.<br /><br />But transformers, yea, transformers movies are just plain garbage. i don't like them for many reasons, the main two being lebeuffff and bay. Pacific rim has things like.... character development....not ridiculous amounts of slow motion action... no lebleueefff... etc... All in all, PR is far better of a film than any of the transformers movies, just because they are both about large robots doesn't mean you can call them the same.<br /><br />Are there stretches in the suspense of disbelief? sure, like i mentioned with the helicopters, but then again were talking about a movie which has a portal to another dimension, so i think it works just fine within the defined reality.<br /><br />The comic relief by charlie day was welcome, though it's a bit hard to believe the government would have quite that level of goofiness in a high level position, but i'm just digging for nitpicks.<br /><br />The one thing that i'm on the wall about is the opening, since it starts year and years after the first monster attack. I think it was a good move to do that and have the recap of how things started, and a brave move at that, seeing as we're in the age of backstory backstory backstory. I just had an itch to see how it all started, and i hope they do a prequel movie of just that.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Left wing propaganda piece. Totally unrealistic plot that demonizes the presidents (clearly meant to be Obama) political enemies and heroes of those who &#34;adore&#34; him.
B0090SI582|3.0|I was on the wall between 3 and 4 stars, and amazon calls 3 stars &#34;It's OK&#34;, and thats what i felt.<br /><br />If you liked origins, i would imagine you might not like this film. Origins was an action flick, typical of what you'd expect from it. This on the other hand was not an action flick, there was some action in it, but it was more of a drama.<br /><br />It kind of seemed like they saw the complaints with the origins movie, and decided to do exactly the opposite. If they did more of a middle ground, they might have had a more clear winner.<br /><br />It overall was well done, but i would have appreciated it being a good 20min shorter, it's over 2 hours, and it does NOT fly by, it feels long. It's worth a watch, just don't be tired and sitting on a comfy couch with your feet up while doing so
B005FUTC86|5.0|Happiest movie of all time. Everyone should see this film at least once. They should used to know how to make them once upon a time.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Such a sleeper hit for funny and sad realities of daily life for so many folks.  Clooney is a genius.  His cast is genuinely perfect and they are all superb in their roles.  This CD lets you relive those onscreen moments, relax and enjoy your memories of the events portrayed.
B000FA6720|5.0|The kind of poetry and understanding of the undercurrents of life and love expressed in this book are unsurpassed. Books with this much feeling are few and far between.
B000W4WF02|5.0|Dude this is a must have movie Quentin is a genius and I do mean genius but you gotta see all three movies together to fully enjoy his work
B0001MLMKY|5.0|This watch is like not wearing a watch. Totally light weight and very comfortable. It seems to give me that James Bond look, even though it's not an omega. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
B0061S073A|4.0|Like how it locks out regular kindle.  However, I wish I could pick anything I wanted from the kindle and put it as an option on their page.  Couldn't get netflix and one other thing on there.
B004MPESSY|3.0|Definitely not as good as the 1st one . The revenge deaths weren't as good. Still a good movie though
B00E00P5JC|3.0|I was worried that this movie would be awesome for the kids but leave parents yawning and bored.<br />I was completely wrong!<br />This was definitely for the whole family. Kids won't understand all the jokes,thankfully, but that's a good thing. They will love the adventure, action and lovable characters. Parents will love that the kids stay focused, while having a few laughs at those jokes the kids don't get.<br />It was also fun trying to pinpoint each actor or actress to the voice. Lots of famous favorites are the voices behind these characters, like Samuel L. Jackson and Snoop Dog. (I know he is Snoop Lion now, but he'll always be Snoop Dog to me.)<br />Plus the ending is &#34;perfectly predictable&#34; and everyone is happy!
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Cute. I liked it. I laughed. It was predictable but I'm okay with that. Nice casting. Many recognizable voices here.
B001EC3JME|2.0|Very hard to get a light in / out of. Even smaller diameter lights. Would be best on a large light such as a D cell Maglite and left on rather than used as a belt holster for a smaller light.<br /><br />Well built, but the concept doesnt work for me.
B000Q67876|5.0|One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Unquestionably, a masterpiece. Undoubtedly, a major gem that will never be forgotten. If you buy it you won't regret it.
1572814349|5.0|Excellent service , love the cards they are so beautifull  :)  i woud sugest this card to everyone else love it.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie is a wonderful translation of a truly wondrous book by Neil Gaiman. The world-class actors are clearly giving it their all and you find yourself drawn into a world beyond the wall. Great movie if you love fantasy, and otherwise still a delightful story.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|This series should have been extended or continued in some capacity. I miss SGA and the cast members and I am overall disappointed at the way this series ended so abruptly being discontinued due to budget cuts and such. The entire Stargate series overall had the potential to be better than the Star Trek series. I suppose it is a blessing in disguise though since the writers have more time to come up with more creative storylines and characters for future Stargate series. I'll be waiting patiently for the next one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Having a ton of fun trying to figure out the different ways to get the door open.<br />Like it a lot.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I have yet to watch my new purchase but having only ordered it yesterday (Amazon's Gold Box price of $78.47-tax included/free shipping) I was surprised to see that it already arrived at my doorstep. I was hesitant to get this because of the reviews I read from other buyers of scratched DVD's/skipping episodes so i'll update my review once I start watching it. However, I did buy it from Amazon so that might be one of the reasons.<br />Anyways, based off surface looks only, it looks great. New, packaged safely and all the DVD's seem to be correct on the inside. No repeating disks and none of the DVD's look fake/copied. I've uploaded some photos if anyone wants to see the inside of the box since right now it only shows the cover and the back. Again, I haven't played any of the DVD's yet so I dont know if it will jump around but so far I'm excited about my purchase.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is my first digital book. I have the hard copy as well. It was so much easier to pack the tablet for a trip than the book.<br /><br />I am only a few chapters in, but J.K. Rowling has already blended a tale, that connects the characters to each other, and keeps the reader thinking.
B007TK77QE|4.0|A slice of life explored with understanding. Small town tensions and rivalries create tension and laughter. The pace is kept alive with movement and the intricate personal struggles of the characters' interaction.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. I used it to post fun pictures from vacations. I even used the photos to make some custom travel postcards.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I lived this movie, I liked the ending, I did not expect it to be like this. I would watch it again
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I like James Bond movies and watch the whenever I can. they just have a lot of action.<br />The Bond movies always keep my interest thru the whole movie
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great story! I loved the whole series but I think this one was my favorite. The twists and turns in the characters lives and the additions of the new tributes made this a quick read. I wish it had been longer just so I could have enjoyed it longer.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|Funny and silly.  Not laugh out loud funny but amusing.  Worth buying.  both main characters are wonderful.  Kids will like it also.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Episode one is not longer on demand and amazon has the best prices per episode. Great & clear streaming and super easy to use.
B00D1X0576|2.0|It's so slow to reach the result. I almost fall to sleep waiting for it to finish the testing. Not good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing. One of the best shows ever made. I can't wait for the next season to start! ! ! !
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Best movie I have ever watched. You can not watch a more exciting movie than this. Welles did an awesome job with this.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|This book is one 'whose' time has come.  Functional and integrative medicine is sweeping the world, giving us as clinicians a new view of not only how we view the patient but how we treat her. This explodes all the myths of dieting and the stark reality that we have not evolved physically as we have liked to believe. Our body has not adjusted to modern day toxic eating nor should it ever. I have had extraordinary success with my patients as well as myself with resistant weight loss and metabolic syndrome. It should be read with David Zinczenko's book on the 8 hour Diet as well. Everyone should read this.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|The entire story was awesome... From beginning to end, non stop excitement. I hope anyone who is looking for a good movie watches this movie.
031623480X|5.0|I am reviewing this book as a clinician and as a patient. I recommend that every professional person in the medical and related professions should read this if they are at all interested in being mindful of what a patient really needs to recover.  We are taught primarily as doctors 'do no harm'. Yet we do harm every day by not reviewing or acknowledging what is in the field beyond what we learn at university. This book by Perlmutter deserves a prize. It confronts reality and our non evolving bodies to the exponential rise in dis-ease and disease.  Perlmutter clearly someone with vast experience forces the reader to deal with things we avoid - something as simple as gluten that features in our every day dietary and purchasing habits and it intrinsically questions our integrity - do we want to face this reality or bury our heads in the sand.  I have had extraordinary success with my patients and myself now that I am applying the principles but I still have a lot to learn. The book is confrontational. It confronts you, your mind, your integrity, your knowledge of your clinical field, your willingness to learn and your sense of social justice.

B000VSBX34|5.0|Being at the theater in 1965, from beginning to end all I heard was girls screaming (what would they have done had the Beatles been live?) Seriously the boys two films were good-they actually had a storyline and a innocence that seemed natural. They were even nominated for some awards. But as Ed Sullivan showed their music was good enough you really didn't need a movie [it was just icing on a cake], just film them singing and the theaters would sell out.<br />I don't need to reverberate everything said already in detail, all the songs were great. The transfer came out really good and really has something \\"extra\\" if you convert to 3D. And the sound can be extremely good with the right equipment.<br />One final thing I remember about \\"Help\\" was some interviewer asking John when they would make their next movie. He said, \\"This is it, after all, we're not actors we're musicians.\\"<br />And musicians that changed history.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|I've read many of Dr. Dyer's books and always get some strong meaning out of them, this book was no different. His words spoke to my soul.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Compelling story and great cinematography.  Genuine feel to the whole picture.  No Hollywood type heroics or false happy ending.  A pleasure to see De Niro, Irons and Neeson.
B009YN2M7S|2.0|I cannot get into it.  Have picked it up 3 times to read it and only get a few paragraphs when I put it back down.  Then I don't pick it up a gain for several weeks.  will eventually finish reading it, but have read better Nicholas Sparks
0393327345|4.0|If you like action, drama, and mystery, then this book is for you. The Fight Club is an exhilarating story with every aspect of a great read. It has awesome characters, brutal scenes, and a mind-boggling plot. However, the story started out jumping from scene to scene and time period to time period. For example, the story actually begins in one of the final scenes, explains all the events leading up to that scene, and finally makes its way bake to the scene – while putting an exiting plot twist on it as well. Therefore, this book was very confusing to me in the beginning (my reasoning behind four stars rather than five), but quickly transforms into an exhilarating drama.<br /> One of the great aspects of this book was the characters. My favorite was Tyler Durden. Tyler is a crazy and mysterious man who, along with the narrator, starts the Fight Club. Tyler is also leader of Project Mayhem, a plan executed by the Fight Club, led by Tyler, to take down the corporate system of America. The narrator himself is a very interesting character, as he is the main character, the insomniac. Tyler and him start the Fight Club. Although he is perfectly healthy in terms of his physical traits, he attends grieving groups with people that have intense diseases. Both the narrator and Tyler have incredibly surprising twists in their lives approximately three-quarters of the way through the book that you will not want to miss. Finally, there’s Big Bob, or Robert Paulson. Big Bob is a body builder who abused steroids. Big Bob is the first to make the narrator cry, which allows the narrator to sleep at night. The narrator says, “I’ve been coming here every week for two years, and every week Bob wraps his arms around me, and I cry.” Big Bob also ends up as a member of the fight club.<br /> Those were my three favorite characters in the book, but what I also loved was the plot. Without saying too much, Tyler and the Narrator become a little too close for comfort and the whole operation becomes a mess. Buildings explode and people are killed. Did Tyler or the Narrator want that? You’ll have to find out.<br /> Overall, this is one of the better books I’ve read because it has little “downtime.” Once about halfway through the book, every scene is an exhilarating one with a huge impact on the storyline. Whether it be a surprising explosion or shocking plot twist, this book is constantly entertaining. Do not let the beginning’s confusion scare you off. This exceptional book is a must read.<br /><br />I advise all students or children under the age of eighteen to get parental consent to read this book as well due to its violence, sexual content, and language.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't stop watching it.  I'd watch the whole season in one setting if I could!  Very well written.  Immediately draws you in.
B009CG9LZI|5.0|Just the most delightful and memorable rendition of a wonderful Christmas read and now, watch. The colors and scenes are so yummy that you can almost smell  Whoville and Christmas.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|An amazing show! That's all that needs to be said. The show is always thrilling and on the edge of your seat.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Slow start to this one, and not as well written as the first two.  Shocking ending, but I've learned to deal with it!
B00459EZLW|5.0|Such a shame it didn't get the time it deserved. It was definitely taken off the air too quick. Rush is one of the best characters in the series.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Very funny movie.  Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn  are great.  A movie about living forever and the other woman.  Re-placing my VHS copy with this DVD.
B00AAQVSDW|4.0|Rocking, feel-good country album.  It's a shame it doesn't include the Cruise remix as a bonus but it was well worth the $3.99.  It may not be a classic I'll come back to for years to come but it'll be on repeat for the time being.
0670024856|5.0|Perfect. In pitch. In sentiment. In what it means to be human.  How rare to find a book that discusses Calvinist values. And even more rare that most of story happens when Alma is middle-aged ... a population sorely neglected and portrayed.
B000FC13UE|3.0|This is a collection of short stories.  Some of them I've enjoyed a lot, most I've just tried to get through.  Overall it's not my favorite book by Neil Gaiman.  I'm a huge fan of Gaiman, and would suggest other books first.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Such a fun and entertaining movie! First thing for all the nay sayers...the story isnt that ground breakingly new. After that, the effects are great, the action holds up and leaves you wanting more, and the characters drive the story (unlike other robot movies...Transformers). Guillermo Del Toro sold me on this and I cant stop watching it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really loved this story.  It's unusual and unique.  If you're an open minded reader who likes fantasy, then this is a great read.  It was really a fun book and I have recommended it to a lot of people.  I only wish it was longer.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved it but it was sad and yea but it was funny and good I would read it over an over again
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It does a fine job in keeping the kindle files cleaned up and running smoothly. Easy to use. I have mine set up to clean once every week. With a click of one button it cleans everything up and is done quickly. And then its back to doing whatever I want.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Big Grisham fan...happy to read he's back in the courtroom; great read!  Hoping the same characters return to the big screen.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|For the first 15 days this product was going to get a 5 star rating. I was getting HD reception on my TV - way better than my Roku box.  After the first 15 days the volume stopped for all videos and resetting Chromecast didn't fix the problem.  Google's help page is terrible and there is no help on how to fix it.  If you are curious buy it but expect it to stop working. Google once again proving, they are unable to create a working hardware.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing it was so awesome there was a ton of action read now now now best book ever! Check it out.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Can't beat the price. $30 for a full new season is incredibly cheap. Especially on release. I've been waiting for this for a while.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first 2 books in this series were some of my favorite books I have ever read, so I highly anticipated the release of the final book. Only to be extremely disappointed. It was nothing like the first books, and after having to wait a year to read the conclusion, you would think that would be enough time to write a decent book. I could have gotten over the monotonous script of the entire book, the repetitive events that dragged on, and even the fact that you were barely able to distinguish between Tobias's and Tris's point of views; BUT, what I cannot get over, what I simply cannot understand-is the ending. What a horrible, horrible ending. It was pointless and completely unnecessary. I don't want to give anything away, as some may still want to give this book a chance,  but if I knew then what I know now I would have skipped this series altogether.  Its too late for that now, but I can save myself some time and heartache and skip the movie that will coming out. What a shame.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Author seems to have lost his gift for writing. I miss the spell-binding novels he used to write.<br />Book is boring and I did not care about the characters.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Sooooo good. I usually read mystery/thriller. ..this was a change. Well worth it. Sad when the book was finished. Loved it.
0679805273|5.0|If you haven't read it, read it...I asked for this book when someone asked me about a gift when I graduated college.  I only asked because of all the hoopla I had heard about it.  I got the book as a gift and 5 years later when I picked it up to read to my daughter after her mother left us it did not disappoint
B008JFUS28|3.0|&#34;It's a different world. Maybe they were different for a reason.&#34; Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not my favorite in the series but a great book not<br /> enough action and a bad ending but good overall
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I am obsessed with this series!! This series is perfectly cast. I love the clothes and the story-lines. Definitely worth the watch.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Complete Star Trek fan .... Love Chris Pine and Zach Quinto. Though it was great to watch, the first part was more entertaining. So 4 stars. A definite must watch for Trekkies.
B00127RAJY|3.0|im not really sure how to rate this since it will be a gift for my daughter for christmas gift
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Neither faithful to the book nor a cohesive, original story.  Has a few good action scenes and passable acting, not much else.
B0010T7R5G|4.0|If you like to watch &#34;weird&#34; sci-fi kinda stuff, you've found it. Some pretty good actors and acting in it too.... I like weird movies, so I liked it....
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Great action packed movie. I like the way it came back to the basic Bond movies of old at the end.
B0053O89Z6|4.0|I just love the story! great performance of actors and actress! can not wait to watch the next season!<br />I recommend!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This was a VERY well written book, very enjoyable, characters well developed.  I gave it a 4 star because there was some language and inappropriate descriptions which just depreciated a book for me even if the story was good. Nevertheless, those things were just droplets in a lake of enjoyable reading.  I also gave it a 4 star because I will not read the next book due to the amount of adultery.  I don't know about you, but I get on Amazon.com to find good clean books that I can enjoy and get away from the nasty television and movies that just hold so much adultery it's nauseating.  So here is your warning if that is what you try to steer clear from as well.  This book on the other hand was clean.  Unfortunately I will not continue the series...a pity the author had to ruin something that was going so well.
B0094K1K42|3.0|this movie is uneven, and sometimes even trite; but it is interesting, especially if you are 30+ ..... or headed to a high school reunion!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|The movie was intense. It started with action and finished with action. I loved the plot and would definitely watch it again. It also gave me much pleasure to see new acting faces. I am so tired of the action actors today that get top salaries for half ass acting. The movie carried itself well and held unto my imagination and attention. The idea that aliens are entering our world through the sea was really creative and different. Kudos to the producer, director and stars. Okay...It's not Academy material but I found it enjoyable and worth the $4.99 rental.
B002RTBN9O|5.0|Great story.  Too bad the Atlas Shrugged  venture could not have been put out with a bigger budget retaining same set of players.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The movie was ridiculous. If I could have asked for a refund, I would have. Boy Oh Boy..Am I glad I did not pay 12 dollars to see it in a theater. The plot was good, but somehow the actors did not carry it through. Jeff Bridges spoke with a bad hillbilly accent that made it hard for me to understand his lines. Then why did the producer/director choose to show him to the living like a sexy woman?  Kevin Bacon( who is a wonderful actor) really agreed to star in the this crappy movie? What was he thinking? Did he really need the money that badly?  I suggest viewers stay away from this one.....What a dud......
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This it fun for Star Trek fans and those that are not. In our family we have both and we enjoyed watching it together.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Amazing movie, one of the few movies that I don't hate for being different from the book. Both of them are master pieces! Love, death, passage and healing, what more can you ask for?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was as if this book was written by another author. The story was unevenly told. The multiple character point of view was confusing, as there was no discernible difference between the characters voices.  Four became whiny and neurotic. That was so frustrating! The ending was sad and a waste of a life.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Could not put this down! Great plot, characters and writing-full of wit and irony. There were a few plot developments that seemed<br />unlikely, but it was easy to forgive because of the overall experience.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This show is a great show if you like all of the other marvel movies.  Otherwise you wouldn't really get it.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ARTPOP is a step away from the darker tones of Born This Way and something more fun and EDM-driven. I was looking forward to this album ever since last year, when it was announced, and this definitely lives up to the hype. Gaga knows how to keep her fans and everybody else wanting more, respectfully so, since she is the Queen of Pop.<br /><br />01: Aura - 5/5. Great album opener! Sounds very experimental. Gaga and Zedd both know how to make a danceable track, although I don't think this would do well on the radio, it sounds amazing and Gaga's vocals are on point. One of my personal favorites.<br /><br />02: Venus - 4/5. Set for Gaga's second single, it's fun but doesn't quite stick until after the first few listens. This song actually stands out on ARTPOP because of how quirky and different it is among the rest of the album.<br /><br />03: G.U.Y. - 5/5. Woah! You'll know right away that this is a Gaga song. The chorus is undeniable catchy, the verses are what pop music is all about and the lyrics are very smart & clever. An electronic pop song and another personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />04: Sexxx Dreams - 5/5. When I hear this song it definitely screams sex. Another catchy song. Gaga's vocals, again, remind us of how she's not your typical pop singer. She can actually hit and belt those notes out, even when auto-tune is slyly present ;)<br /><br />05: Jewels N' Drugs - 3/5. This song features rap/hip-hop artists T.I., Too $hort & Twista. Every album has at least one filler but calling this filler is going overboard. Again, it's pop, to be taken for what it is. It's pleasant to the ears with urban, electronic and trap influences. Not a bad song but feels almost out of place on the album, but one can see why: to take a break from \\"the pop\\".<br /><br />06: MANiCURE - 5/5. Gaga's vocals! Did I mention that already? This is why she's the Queen of Pop, because she can actually sing, duh! Ok, I know a hit when I hear one and if I don't hear this on the radio one dayI'll know for-sure that my ears are wrecked. This song is amazing!!! A little biased since it's one of my favorites from the album but I love this song in particular because it has that rock n' roll feel and plays with trap music towards the end. Name someone who's done that before?<br /><br />07: Do What U Want - 4/5. The 2nd single from ARTPOP. For some reason I feel as though this could have easily fit on The Fame Monster. I love Gaga's voice on this and R. Kelly definitely adds a great touch. It's a great song that displays how both of their voices come together. The lyrics and the message of the song are what I love most. I also love how Gaga truly belts out everything she's singing. So much emotion and passion. A song you can't skip!<br /><br />08: ARTPOP - 4/5. The album title. I was actually surprised because I thought the album would have more songs that sound how this does. It's refreshing to hear this after the first 7 songs in because it's almost as if you were on a roller coaster until now, finally taking a breather. Very electronic and \\"space-y\\".<br /><br />09: Swine - 3/5. Back to the hard thumping beats. I love this song, very electronic, my type of music. But I have to say, it left a lot to be desired. It feels as though something is missing? A song you either skip or you don't.<br /><br />10: Donatella - 4/5. The funniest song on ARTPOP. The lyrics are about being a vapid \\"rich-bitch\\", which aren't supposed to be taken literally. Again, this is what pop music is about. This song offers something the previous track didn't. It has the \\"oomf\\" that makes it a fun dance track.<br /><br />11: Fashion! - 4/5. A stand-out on the album. Sounds very different from the rest of ARTPOP. Why? Because it was produced by will.i.am with finishing touches by David Guetta. This song brings back memories of The Fame and screams Lady Gaga. Refreshing to hear amidst all the noisier tracks. The lyrics are straight-forward and the song title could have easily been called'Slay' because the Queen of Pop does just that (with all of her outfit choices).<br /><br />12: Mary Jane Holland - 5/5. Electronic dance meets theater? A favorite of mine because the chorus is very catchy and the lyrics are clever. A song you just have to listen to because even words can't really describe it!?<br /><br />13: Dope - 5/5. W O W. The first ballad on ARTPOP and it is unbelievable great! I've mentioned Gaga's vocals one-too many times already but this is really it, guys. Listen to this song. This is definitely a highlight on the album. A stripped-down piano ballad which almost reminds me of a Killer's song. The lyrics are very touching and honest.<br /><br />14: Gypsy - 5/5. A mid-tempo ballad which, again, display Gaga's vocal ability very well. A catchy tune that I could only hope becomes a hit single on the radio. The chorus is amazing and the lyrics are touching as-well. Some may say this is sister to 'The Edge of Glory', which is definitely a compliment, but this song shines on its own. Another highlight on the album!<br /><br />15: Applause - 4/5. The 1st single. We've all heard it and I must say, a great \\"come-back\\" song. Very theatrical. A catchy and radio-friendly track. I can see why it was picked to kick off the \\"start\\" of ARTPOP.<br /><br />Another solid effort by Lady Gaga. She delivered and keeps on doing so again and again. You can't skip ARTPOP! Don't forget to purchase it in-store or here on Amazon because only the first 500,000 copies that are made are featured with foil packaging, which are described to be 'the true artistic vision of the artist Jeff Koons', who sculptured Gaga on the cover.<br /><br />Songs to download/stream: G.U.Y., MANiCURE, Fashion!, Dope, Gypsy.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I use linkedin to connect with business professionals for networking and referrals.  It is a good means for that rather than trying to use facebook.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was hard to tell who was leading or speaking in the transitions. If it weren't for the headings of each chapter it would have been hard to tell. Also, i loved all of the books, but if this is the way it ends with Tris dying and Tobias alone i don't agree. It would seem to me that Tris was more special than anyone ever had been.  So, why couldnt she be meant for more than her own death.  It was just a huge let down the way the final book moved along.  The others were so fast paced and full of energy. This one seemed kind of pointless with no real direction until the very end.  I would read the first two over and over, but this one is not so great. I could accept Tris dying, but i think it would have ended better with Tobias either being with her of dying as well by her side.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The graphics are great.  like this game so much that i play it everyday.  This game is awesome!!! Fun fun fun everybody come and play.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Creepy, Scary, unexpected.  This series will make you jump out of your seat!Not only is it scary, but also extremely well directed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Keeps my interest. Good graphics. Challenging. Wish<br />You did not have to wait for lives. Very addictive game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game allows ypu to creste your own city. While you can expand the territory and build incredible buildings, the one thing i dislike is the usage of energy. Energy is required to build stucturez. There is a five minute eaiting period when you run out of it. Other than that, this is a cool app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app, use it everyday. Looking forward to the kid's version. Good job, thank you so much for the effort, May God bless your ministry.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|I've had it a couple of days and have to say it's a nice change. The graphics are fine and the challenges a good for a simple game like this. I would like to see a little more on how you receive points but overall it's a nice game.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is pretty fun, it may take just a bit to get used to how to play it, but it's awesome once u get comfortable playing it.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|This movie was entertaining but lacked in all character development, plot, and didn't really explain itself at all. I see it as a movie studio trying to capitalize on the popularity of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead (which has great character development and a plot).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of my favorite &#34;modern&#34; Stephen King books.  If you haven't read any for a while, give it a shot.  It won't beat out &#34;The Stand&#34; or some of the King classics, but in my opinion one of his best in years.
0345472322|4.0|I loved the overall message but felt it the book was longer than it needed to be and was more heavy on examples, than practices to help you actively work on building a growth mindset.
0743216458|4.0|Really great book on the 101st Airborne during WWII<br />This is the basis of the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers which is an amazing mini-series<br />This book, as all sources, has a lot more backstory regarding the war.<br />If you loved the mini-series, you'll really enjoy this book.
B0094M2H2E|5.0|My daughter loved the movie. I also didn't mind watching it ;-) Only wish there were more tinker Bell movies.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.  Nothing fancy, but fanciness would add nothing to the product.  Just what I wanted!
B008JFUS28|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be good even though Branagh wasn't at the helm. Well the movie was great!<br />way better than the first thor, miles ahead from the disappointing Iron Man 3 (worst Iron Man), and maybe, the best superhero movie of the year as it is very close to awesomeness  with Superman and Wolverine.<br />---Strong Points---<br /> The acting is superb. From the main characters (Loki is so unbelievably good)to even the smallest characters, each one adds so well to the movie (Russo was fantastic too!). Of course the script helps the actors but they elevate their characters so much.. Portman was good (from being bad in the first Thor), Elba was great, thor was ...thor and Hopkins is of course on the top league. Loki gives the best performance of his life and I wish I saw this actor on a play or something on Broadway (snt far from Worcester!). That being sad the only superhero movie that could surpass this one in terms of good actors both in quantity and quality would probably be the upcoming x-men. If the script helps them that much as here.<br /> There is action far more than the first movie and there is sci fi. If Superman was 35% scifi this one is 80% sci fi but that is something good than bad...the rest of the 20% is magic!!<br /> Story is good, good villains....5 out of 5 stars<br />---Negative points---<br />There is no need to try and find negative points here...Its a super hero movie, its gonna have flaws but nothing important really. I left the movies feeling great even though  a little bit dizzy from the 3d.<br />  Far better than Iron Man 3 which was a disappointment especially when everybody was saying how good it was (I don't get how people compare things anymore. something is good or bad related to something else unless it is something entirely new)<br />So Iron man 3 was inferior to the other 2 and bad compared with the rest of the superhero movies.<br />Thor was better than the first in all aspects, and possibly the best superhero movie of this year and second as a whole movie only to Gravity.of this year and second as a whole movie only to Gravity.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed the book. A quick read.<br />Stated both sides to an important issue.<br />Made me think strongly about &#34;walking in another's shoes&#34;
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As you read this you can see the charters in the movie &#34;A time to kill&#34;.  I think John Grisham is back.
B007MDB71O|5.0|It's a great andventure, my kids love it, and a Great misunderstood movie, I still don't get why it flopped. Great Story, great characters and Stunning VFX!!
B000VMFDW2|3.0|A good graphic and well written war story that unfortunately becomes repetitive in nature. A good story and read to begin with but certainly not compelling.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Very good Bond film, with all the requisites. Daniel Craig certainly plays an excellent James Bond. Judi Dench is the quintessential &#34;M&#34;. Javier Bardem takes his place among the long line of Bond villains.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Trekkies are dancing for joy in the aisles.  The Star Trek saga continues, and they nailed it with these actors.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thought it would be another winner and it is!Starts well and you know who gets their come uppance and it hold s you well
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|I really expected more from this movie.  I didn't get a real sense of tension or high drama.  Maybe my sights were too high.  I'm just glad I bought it used at a cheap price.
B009CFZ8VU|5.0|I love this movie. I do wish they had showed more of Frank Lucas's good times but I know they didn't want to make him look that good.
1476727651|5.0|Love, love, love love....oh did I mention that I love this?  It's Stephen King bringing back a favorite character.  What's not to love?  This one won't creep you out though.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Love Baz Luhrmann..  a visionary film maker.  It was a good telling of this story.  Appreciate that the acting was believable..  sets, cinematography outstanding.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|One of the most mind bending movies ever.  I have recommended and given this movie to so many people.  I love it when I finish a movie and have to ask my husband, &#34;So what do you think was real?&#34;
B004AUFVU0|5.0|This is such a sweet movie set in the early 60's about true love. Jack Lemmon and a cute Shirley McClain are wonderful!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Pretty good novel, I am hopeful that this will be continued in sequels. Follow the boy as he learns about how the world came to be as it is now and how he can help to fix it.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Its a simple yet entertaining game. So far no glitches, and it makes me smile a lot. That's enough for me.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great second novel, can't wait for the third installment. Filled in some blank spots and built more character development while keeping the plot moving in both predictable and interesting ways.  A worthy book to occupy many evenings. This is better than the first book and it was pretty good on its own.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|Again this is a great movie, plenty of action, good story, and added humor.  I highly recommended this movie.  Very Good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another well written book by John Grisham.  Keeps your interest and hard to put down! Loved it.  Can't wait for the next book.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I liked this movie for one . . .Tom Cruise, and secondly it was a good story.  It kept your interest throughout the movie all the way to the end.
B00FR3QVW6|5.0|Incredible album. I love almost every track on it, especially Holy Branches, The Mute, Reminders, Summer Skeletons and The Crooked Kind.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|This was a very suspenseful movie besides being a bit nerve wracking.  Some of the scenes and the audio were surprisingly set up to be an unexpected surprise.
B000003N7F|5.0|Sounds perfectly well, and this really pumps up my mornings!<br />Looking forward to complement it with some Miles Davis albums.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool I especially love preparing for competions; I'm saving up for some clothes to boost presentation
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device works well. It's pretty easy to set up, and it isn't too cumbersome. Google has yet to allow developers to integrate it into their apps though, which left me using it only for Netflix and Youtube.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun. It is not geared for kids as it wants you to buy things a lot.  I wish when you collected money/coins you could use it to buy gems and not have to use real money! This game can be very expensive if you want to finish all the quests.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|That's a strong statement to make but I think this superb movie backs up the claim with an intelligent script, a deft directorial touch by Terry Gilliam and first rate performances by the leads. Other reviews have suggested this is the best movie about time travel and that may be true but this surprisingly heartfelt film is much more multi-faceted than simply a tale about how events in the past affect the future and vice-versa. One of the surprising things about this film, not necessarily noticed in its first viewing, is how spare the dialogue is, lending a somber quiet to parts of the film. Credit Gilliam for that choice but also Bruce Willis especially for a nuanced performance that lays bare his soul. I've always liked Willis as an actor but this may be his greatest role and he rises to the occasion. It takes acting chops to play someone as simple as Cole and Willis pulls it off. He anchors the sometimes wild plot twists, his pain making us believe this is really happening to him. Even as we view the horrible post apocalyptic future and knowing in the past how this is likely to come about, it is Cole's pain and longing that we feel most deeply. In fact, my one main quibble with the film was Gilliam's choice to add surreal, comical elements to the story. These bits are at total odds to the mood of the film, seeming to have been imported from some other film entirely. That said, the humor and craziness shown by Brad Pitt's character does work, as it's grounded in his character's mental instability. Pitt was already a rising star at this point and after Legends of the Fall, a heartthrob. It was a risk taking on the Goins character and Pitt gives a spellbinding performance, showing the restless intelligence beneath Goins disturbed mind. Pitt makes us believe that he does know something important, that in some way the story revolves around him. The rest of the cast acquit themselves admirably but it is Willis, Pitt and Madelaine Stowe that hold our interest. Gilliam sinks his hooks into the viewer by having Cole's mission, and his time in the past, confounded by mistakes, be that the inaccuracies of his time travel, by unforeseen events in the past, even by the choices Willis makes in coming to terms with the freedoms suddenly offered to him in this new world. To the viewer, the events that unfold are a twisting, sometimes confusing mess but that's exactly Gilliam's point. Ironically, it is Gilliam's decision to keep the characters' straightforward humanity front and center within the swirling storylines that makes 12 Monkeys such an absorbing film. It's this human element that elevates 12 Monkeys to the very top of mainstream Sci-Fi movies. You never stop feeling Cole's pain and his longing to be free, even as you gradually come to understand what terrible consequences that longing will have. This was Gilliam's greatest film and one of the most thoughtful Science Fiction films ever made. That's exactly why it holds up to repeated viewings and why it's one of the few movies that I chose to own.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Enjoyable. Fun to play. Good time consumer. Good graphics. Would recommend the game to others. Easy to learn. Works great on Kindle.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not as good as the previous two.  I'm also not a fan of Tobias's viewpoint.  He's not different enough.  Overall, it was good.
B007C12RDS|4.0|Interesting story line. The characters are real-life and shows good and bad of persons actions. Hope this show will continue for sometime.
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|Since Amazon condenses the reviews of multiple formats into one pile, I hope this one stands out. It covers CBS/Paramount's new Blu-ray release of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"'s fifth season, NOT the earlier DVD release. I was able to get an advance copy from the studio and also used it to write a separate full-length review of this title, listed below.<br /><br />Once again, CBS Video has produced a top tier Blu-ray release that \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" fans will enjoy. Each and every episode has been re-scanned from the original camera negative, with the end result being much crisper and more detailed than the older DVD and broadcast versions which were shot on film but edited on videotape. The visual effects in many cases have been cleaned up or tastefully redone, and I'd be hard-pressed to complain about any of them. They're so good that casual fans of \\"TNG\\" might not even notice!<br /><br />As for the episodes themselves, Season Five is home to some of \\"TNG\\"'s best moments, from the fan favorite episode \\"Inner Light\\" to the two-part \\"Unification\\" that guest stars Leonard Nimoy as Spock (and this two-parter is available as a separate Blu-ray release, too). Other notable episodes include \\"Power Play\\", \\"Darmok\\", \\"Cause and Effect\\" and many more, with only a handful of less impressive outings along the way. As with past Blu-ray releases, the top-notch restoration WILL amplify your enjoyment of the series: a lot of time, money and effort went into this show week after week during its original run and, in some cases, you'll see details you've never noticed before. Simply put, if you're a fan of \\"TNG\\" you'll want to check this out immediately.<br /><br />As for the bonus features, they're mostly as good as the ones we've seen on past Blu-ray collections. Highlights include a two-part retrospective featurette that spends some time remembering \\"Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry (who died during this season's production), a 70-minute roundtable interview with three of \\"TNG\\"'s main music composers, four new audio commentaries, a handful of deleted scenes, a blooper reel, TV promos and more. The archive featurettes from the DVD release are even ported over!<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic set whose price shouldn't intimidate you. A lot of effort went into its production and you'll get your money's worth. For more details, please read my complete review at: [...]
0143124544|5.0|I got this book and finished it in two days! It was so good I love Louisa's character and I really felt for her... I'll be passing this book along for my mother and sister to read...
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Tried to read this a number of times just couldn't get into it. Enough whining about weight. And the relationship with young guy. Really. Just too unrealistic
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  I was so excited to see that it was available for the kindle and called All the kindle owners I know to inform them. Yipee!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|We recently lost our beloved &#34;Ollie&#34;. To state a dog is man's best friend is an understatement. Reading The Art of Racing in the Rain has made the smile return knowing our Ollie will once again find us. The author writes from the dog Enzo's thoughts which is charming and humorous but most of all, insightful. Thankyou to the author for helping our family get through this difficult time
B00ANAC32U|3.0|It did saved my Nexus 4 twice already (I've already broke 3 Nexus 4 screens). But it ruins the beauty of the phone.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just got this game for my kindle fire. Great graphics! Easy to play. Glad I downloaded this game. Recommend for any hunter.
B00C7NKPPS|1.0|Nowhere on Amazon, did this CD indicate, it was LIVE.  When you look at it, and all the differing views of the CD, it just doesn't look to be LIVE.  So, there are loads of all of McCartney's best songs, ever, however, no the later years of his life, performing LIVE.
0060512806|5.0|The cryptonomicon is my second favorite of all of Neal Stephenson's books.  It artfully weaves three separate plots in two different timelines into a story where the whole became more than a sum of the parts.  It has a good primer on cyrptography, Nazis, treasure hunts, WWII soldiers and IT geeks.  This is the third copy of this book that I have purchased and I gave the other two to friends.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Extremely useful book which summarizes a lot of key information. My trainer approves of the message and method (because it's really pretty simple... eat right and exercise appropriately); overall the book has helped me focus my approach. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there's quite a bit of opening fluff before you get to the meat of the advice and program (as noted by other reviewers). Overall though, if you're just starting out (or think you already know but have some holes in your fitness knowledge), I would highly recommend this book. Kudos to the author all round, but also for including the summary guide on the website!
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Seriously. Just watch Hangover (the original) again. This movie is not funny at all. I love most of the people in the cast, but it was a definite let-down.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The series has produced consistently good story lines, good acting and characters that draw you in. I recommend it highly.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved it.  If kept engrossed from beginning to end.  The ending threw me.  I recommend this to anyone.  A great read!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the best Grisham book to date. In typical Grisham fashion it is a &#34;can't put it down page turner&#34;. All the characters were well developed and it kept the intrigue and suspense at a high level til the end.  I was never sure what was going to happen from one event to the next and how everything would come together until the end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Captivating story line with intertwined characters leaves you reading in bed at midnight because you can't put it down!!! Highly recommend it!
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Good movie and interesting slice of history.  Good movie that shows the Native American and how they helped us win WWII
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|it was a fast pace and a intense book I recommend it for every great reader Brandon Sanderson is a great authoe
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|This movie is so great!! It's full of drama with a few laughs thrown in there. I love me some Barbra. If you love musicals, you'll love this one.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is okay, but our Wii is streaming Nexflix much better.  You have to download the entire show from Netflix (haven't tried Hulu yet) first, and some of the movies can't be downloaded to the Chromecast.  That is dumb.  I hope it will work nicely for sports that we can play on our laptops, but don't have through our basic cable.  Haven't gotten to try that yet.  If that works, it is worth the $30.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game -- love the graphics -- works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire and Galaxy smartphone.  Very addictive game but so much fun.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Very handy, zoomable and not overly demanding on memory storage.  Loadable on a a state-by-state basis.  The details are surprisingly good, but not comprehensive by any means.  It's an excellent value for general use, loads quickly and is wonderfully portable.  It does not feature a search function.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Limited apps so far. It may work out in the future.Nice price, nice product some day<br />Nice price, nice product some day
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was well written and kept my interest.  Was an interesting twist on how to look at how you might react if this was your child.  I would recommend this book.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Interesting premise of how Harry healed from the loss of his child and his life the way it had been before his loss.  I liked the way the author had both Harry and his wife heal separately, in different ways, but still struggled to connect and share until the end of the story.
B00GKS2HN4|2.0|I love point n click games, especially those of the horror variety, but when I can't actually immerse myself in them it's not as fun. The ads at the top of the screen were understandable, it's a free game, but the ad that pops up after every few miss-clicks is highly frustrating. How am I supposed to find what I'm missing and also stay interested in the game when a full page ad pops up for a fluffy pet game? I wanted to rage quit after about the 15th time it showed up. I only gave two stars for this reason and also because during the 20 minutes that I played I had to force close it twice after freezing up.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This was a really interesting take on the superhero genre. It was far darker than I expected, and that made it a fun read. It was great to get such a fresh take. I'm looking forward to the second book in the series.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Information at a glance, easy to use, smart colorful graphics.  Easy to manipulate and access data.  Best of all its free.
B004DM0UII|2.0|I ordered this without knowing what it was, I'm afraid. I thought I had deleted it from my device. If it's still on there, I have never used it. No place in my life for that kind of music.
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you are a Star Trek fan this is a must see. Action from start to finish. This is a new twist on an old story
B005K17RU0|1.0|I love it on the phone, but it updated itself on the kindle and now it doesn't work. Nuff said.
1588167461|4.0|This is a simple, old-style way of dressing.  I like the detail in the collar care and descriptions.  There are more modern ways of dressing.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Great movie. It kept me thinking and on the edge of my seat the entire time. Crazy twist at the end.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I love an action packed movie and the Advengers fit the bill!! Tony really was challenged with this one. I recommend the movie for people with a sense of humor who enjoy a movie that keeps your attention!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great movie, great characters. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and coming back for more. All around good movie.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Awesome season. A surprise in every episode. Keeps you captivated and entertainment from beginning to the very end. A must watch.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Great application.  I use it almost daily and have had no problems.  It is really useful if you spend a lot of time on the road.
0385349947|5.0|The book encourages the leadership of women like no other book I have read. I would recommend it to women and men in leadership as well as mothers and fathers with daughters. I also like it because I don't see it as a male bashing book, but  one that clears the way for women to see themselves setting at all the tables in the workplace.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is a very interesting look into the chemistry and medical implications of grains on the body, in particular, the brain. Along with &#34;The Wheat Belly Diet&#34;, it is a very compelling discussion.
B00D2JDNQ4|3.0|Loved this book, think it was a worthy winner of man booker, beautifully written with characters who are unforgettable.  Would gladly have given another star if there had just been a few less pages, there were a couple of times early on when I thought there were more descriptive words than necessary,  Having said that cant wait to read the next Eleanor Catton.  Shes a clever girl.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|More than a thousand have already provided summaries and opinions on the movie itself and its relationship to the Alien films so my review and rating is based solely upon the quality of the transfer of the film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />Video Quality…..<br />  The transfer to Blu Ray is exceptional with, for the most part, warm color grading and sharp contrast.  Details are clearly defined even in  the darker areas of the film.  At no point did I see any ringing as a result of the CGI scenes and no artifacting was ever noticed either.  Grain was never present that I could see and I can find absolutely no fault in any of the film's presence on this Blu Ray disc.<br /><br />Audio Quality….<br />  I was very excited that this Blu Ray offered a choice between a DTS MA HD 5.1 and 7.1 audio.  Both are a lossless codec which will always provide a clearer and more transparent dialogue, soundtrack and foley effects.  Since I do watch and listen on a hi end 7.1 audio system, that they provided a 7.1 choice is always a treat. My system includes a center channel, two front left and right speakers, two rear side channels where my listening position is and two left and right rear channels.  The audio tracking included a great many discreet channeling pans and foleys to the side front and rear channels creating a very immersive audio experience.  To be honest, I did not notice any discreet channeling to the last two rear channels.  While they contributed greatly to the audio immersion effect, discreet foley audio from those channels were not heard.  I have watched and listened to this film in a 5.1 mode and could tell very little difference between the 5.1 and 7.1 mix, thus I was a touch disappointed with the 7.1 mix.  Never the less, the audio is exceptionally good no matter what type of system you are using and this, along with the beautifully produced video is why I gave the film 5 stars.  As a movie itself, it would not have been so highly rated.<br /><br />Extras….Several deleted and alternate scenes which I always enjoy and the commentary regarding these scenes was really quite interesting.  Also included are a couple of full film commentaries which I have not listened to.  A hard disc digital copy is also included in the package with choices between downloading to either Ultra Violet, which I do not like, and iTunes, which, to me, is the way to go.  You do have to enter the redemption code which is included on the insert with the disc.  Downloading to iTunes took about 6 minutes.<br /><br />Well, if you do like Prometheus as a film than you will certainly want to include the Blu Ray copy within your collection of films.  The quality of the disc is excellent.  I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading.deleted and alternate scenes which I always enjoy and the commentary regarding these scenes was really quite interesting.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|He can always come up with a surprise ending as well as bringing you back to his little southern town as though you were coming home again for a visit.  His books are so well written that they are a joy to read and you want to know the ending, but you don't want the book to end.  If only he could write two or three a year.  This one lived up to my expectations and beyond.  Well worth waiting for. I hope he's working on another one soon.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is amazing! I love that the amazon edition has no commercials! The quality was good and had no problem hooking it up to my TV.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What's not to love about this cast?  I could have watched it over and over.  It's a nice little movie and a great cast.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|FAOTD. ONCE I STARTED PLAYING I WAS HOOKED AND COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. ITS BEEN OVER TWO HOURS AND I NEEDED A BREAK SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE A REVIEW AND RATING.
B003B02OOG|5.0|It was a treat to hear more about the little county where most of his novels take place.  His writing is flawless as always.
B00G32TD98|4.0|I enjoy films about hauntings, and overall I would recommend this film. There were a few classic scenes that were very memorable. I think they missed out on a few opportunities for additional scares etc. and should have just forgone any recollections of the family members and seized the those opportunities. Supposedly this is based on a real account, but if so it's easy to imagine most of the happenings to be mostly in the minds of the family. The mind is a powerful thing. Still.. it was a fun watch.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a good program.  I don't play it a lot, but it's nice to have handy when I want something to occupy my mind for a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was surely the best book I have ever read in my life I am about to read the second book, Catching Fire. I will be epic!!! Even my friend is reading this book for real I love it it's a lot of fun and adventures in it,I think everyone likes it. Go katniss and peeta!!!read this book unless you are not allowed to.
B009439HEY|3.0|I have no issue with any of the performers on this CD.  I love the songs, and they are all played amazingly.  But there is something a little \\"cheesy\\" about the whole affair which kind of turns me off a bit.  I also can't help but wonder what the point of this CD is other than an incredibly professional and star-studded (as far as prog goes, anyway) money grab.<br /><br />The main emotion I feel when listening to this CD is that I should turn it off and listen to the originals.  A fine release for what it is, but it's nothing that was really needed.  If I want to hear \\"Supper's Ready\\", I'll put on Side Two of \\"Foxtrot\\".  If I want to hear Steve Hackett, I'll put on \\"Bay of Kings\\" or \\"Voyage of the Acolyte\\".
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept you reading right until the end.  The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the ending; I wanted more!  But maybe a sequel??
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I don't know how I missed this movie... I had never even heard of it so I suspect that the studio did a massively horrible job of promoting it because it is absolutely delightful with well done effects, wonderful character acting, crisp writing, and outstanding performances from the lead actors. Robert DeNiro and his pirate crew are a hoot as is Michelle Pfeiffer and her witches coven. There wasn't anything I disliked about this little film! If you liked &#34;The Princess Bride&#34; you'll love this movie too....!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Watched them with my father when I was very young. Loved introducing them to my son now.  The effects suffer compared to the new versions, but the interplay between the main characters is great. And NO ONE pause-acts like Shatner!
B00CUIVGZS|4.0|Another quick sale of a great product.  Love Chick Corea and his music.  I have not been disappointed in my purchases to date and will continue to do so in the future.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|The movie was a nice surprise. Better than I expected. Stirred up a few patriotic feelings that hasn't happened in a while.
B00BUKODDO|4.0|Quick sale. This was a gift for my dad and he really loves it.  I will purchase more in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Something to do when you want to pass the time.  Enjoyable, the whole family can play and improves hand/eye coordination.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I love this movie even though it makes me feel so melancholy.  I love the chemistry between Travolta and John as well as the other cast members.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Divergent was refreshing. I enjoyed the unique premise, the lack of a love triangle, and a female lead character that was neither a pushover nor brilliant at everything. After the slightly less satisfying Insurgent (which I expected of a middle book), I was excited to read Allegiant and bring the series to a close.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is a dissatisfying ending (and not only because of the actual ending!) Part of what made Divergent so engrossing was its characters, but the personalities were sorely lacking in this book. At times it felt like they weren't even the same characters anymore, and I don't mean that in a growth kind of way. Four, in particular, is disappointing in this book. Though he has a sensitive side and questions it himself, no one could doubt that Four belonged in Dauntless during Divergent. Here, he has been replaced by a rash, self-doubting, moping boy I wanted to shake by the shoulders for most of the book. Tris seems more self-righteous teenager than justified insurgent, and most other characters are just filler.<br /><br />The action and intrigue weren't at the same level of Divergent or Insurgent, and answers to mysteries fall flat. I was left with an &#34;Oh, that's it?&#34; feeling instead of the, &#34;Wow! I didn't see that coming!&#34; reaction I wanted.<br /><br />Switching narrators throughout the book also completely changed the tone from the first two books and made the novel feel like it was rushed (even though it's almost too long). It also made it confusing to follow the story. As other reviewers have noted, Tris and Tobias have incredibly similar voices. I frequently had to go back and check whose chapter I was reading.<br /><br />Though I can still see myself rereading Divergent and Insurgent, I'll leave this one sitting on my bookshelf.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Having this quality translation available at my fingertips is a great aid in my own study, but more important, in helping me show others the truth about God's word. I really look forward to the enhancements that will undoubtedly be coming in the future.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really a page turner. Well thought out and well written. The characters are richly developed and the reader comes to know them well and identify with their situations. It is a suspense told with an everyday believability. Good, good read.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|the streaming quality was great. A10/V10 no buffering. i have charter  30meg hard wired giga bit to router. god movie gave 4 stars because of movie. needed more gizmoes!
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I was wowed.  It was really irresistible. I couldn't put it down as I wanted to know what will happen next. Simply beautiful.
1401917232|5.0|Gary Renard is the premier teacher of the spiritual teachings of \\"A Course In Miracles\\", and this third book in his trilogy continues to amaze and astound with the visits from two ascended Masters who visit, teach, coach, prod, and even joke with him! As with his first two books, my jaw hung agape with the radical revelations and uncompromising spiritual teachings that this life is a dream of our ego trying to convince us we are separate from God, about true forgiveness, and our true reality - we are all one with all of our Holy brothers, and are all truly the Holy Son of God. Thank you, Gary!!!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|excellent album, the band continues to get better with each release. whoever produces this album did a great job with the bands sound. glad i bought it and i recommend to any rock fans out there
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very thorough. Seems though to go on more than is needed.  Make it easier to turn off. Lose the adds.
B002T9H2ME|1.0|There really is no engaging plot or appealing story line. Hardcore Science Fiction fans with a brain, won't know what will happen next or why it is happening, nor will they care.<br /><br />MOON (2009) might have been an engaging if (unintentionally) it was a short series, but as a stand alone Science Fiction story it was underdeveloped and repulsively tiresome but not really entrancing enough to watch for that reason. The movie reminded me of Silent Running (1971), if Sam Rockwell had been a drugged out Moon-naut, so that makes it kind of worth watching for as an alluring, repellent Science Fiction comedy. Was this really made in 2009? The clothes would point more towards 1988, the production lacks much science and technology credibility.<br /><br />To be honest, I had to double-check to make sure that this film wasn't just some movie add-on to a larger loathsome Sci-Fi series (the \\"new\\" Battlestar Galactica), but to no avail. Moon (not sure why it's called that since it takes place on Jupiter) seems like a bunch of independent Twilight Zone scenes put together to hopefully form a cohesive story, but fails at it.<br /><br />Not something I would suggest to watch.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Suspenseful!  Brad Pitt's work evolves with him.  He's not like stars who continue to try to play the same role regardless of age.  This is fun and exciting!
B0034G4P94|5.0|A very good and awesome movie. I'm just going to say just details since most reviews give the story. It may start pretty slow in story wise at the beginning, starts to increase little by little. Their is some mild language, mild to little blood scene(mostly the fights) and good fight scenes at the mid to end of movie. Their is no sex scene or anything like that, so it's safe. Just mild language and some rough fights. It's pretty realistic to now in days with they whole economy thing, so many may relate to the point if this movie. Hope this helps to any wanting to buy. It's UFC/Martial arts movie. Worth every cent to buy. Enjoy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first two books in this trilogy. It was disappointing, especially after waiting for the release of this book.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Seeing complete episodes for first time in 45 years was wonderful. What we see in TV reruns is severely truncated.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|NO NO NO NO NO! XRITE got it wrong. This turned my monitor into some funky colored/distorted mess. I plan on purchasing the Spyder soon. This just doesn't work for what I need.<br /><br />The customer service is poor as well. I contacted someone regarding this device and to assist me and they directed me to read the FAQS.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Brought me to tears. Much superior to stage version. One of the best movies ever. I wish everyone could see it.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Thank you for writing this book. Thank you for lifting my energy levels. Thank you for complicating a simple lesson to help us see the importance & then simplifying it again. My life will never be the same & I couldn't be more thrilled... More grateful.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|It's so fun I played it 3 hours straight the most addicting is fly the frog omg can't live without it also stars are hard to get but other than that amazing that they came up with this game.  Coming from a 10year old
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|The movie moves between time and location and incident in a flow of ebb and surge, giving the time to feel and learn then the time to be shocked and infuriated. It was a natural juxtaposition of human naiveté and human greed, the latter manipulating the former. And in between the orcas were torn to pieces. I felt such grief at the end of the film, but know also that it represents the tip of the iceberg when it comes to human cruelty toward the animals that are supposed to be our wards if not our equals.
1250038820|5.0|Such a beautiful and moving book. Every story is interesting, meeting each person must have been an incredible experience. Kinda hoping for a HONY 2 !
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Her talent is introspection of characters.<br /><br />When you have alternating voices throughout the book, from Four to Tris and back, I shouldn't have to pause in the middle of the chapter, if I put the book down for a moment, and have to think, &#34;Who am I reading again?&#34; Still, this happened even if I just stopped reading long enough to pet my puppy.<br /><br />Her &#34;strategies&#34; were incredibly faulty--if you're going to write about huge moments of rebellion and uprisings, get someone to give you tips on strategy. All in all, her shining moment was simply when she got back to serious character introspection at the end. But getting there? I had to read her blog about her book to understand the journey of the characters--but if you have to write a blog about your book to make that clear, there's probably a problem with your book.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Great action movie and a well executed script.  Daniel Craig's performance was excellent.  The end of the movie was a surprise.  Can't wait for the next interation of 007.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Not bad, just not incredible.  It's a mix of Transformers, Godzilla, and similar movies.  There is the usual, tough guy stand-offs and win the girl.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This is essentially beheaded while the creAtors make more levels using a simple generator. HORRIFIC quality. Spans Facebook and begs for money
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Could not stop reading it. Outstanding work Mr. Grisham. Is there a plan to make it a movie?
B000IDEORY|5.0|It's just a great movie. I love the dancing and miss Patrick Swayze. Addresses social issues. It's up there with Grease.
0345803485|1.0|I am only happy that I didn't pay money for this book and only read up to about page 60 before I quit. A coworker gave this to me and I am now wondering if she really doesn't like me. I'm not kidding.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Seen this film probably dozens of times and never tire of it. Great adventure, beautiful photography... and a really awesome story of a psychological power struggle between two stubborn alpha males: a by-the-book British colonel/POW and the Japanese commander of the camp who is charged with finishing a railroad bridge OR ELSE.  Of course the captured British soldiers are to be used as slave labor. But when he wants to make the officers work, too, flaunting the Geneva Convenion, that's when the troubles begin. William Holden is great as the one American prisoner who is resigned to his fate as &#34;a slave&#34;, and is pretty much a heel just trying to survive -- but eventually finds his heroic bones. Many other great characters populate the film. This masterpiece was produced in the mid 1950's, so the building of the bridge and the bridge itself were NOT miniatures or computer generated effects. This was shot on location in Ceylon and one can feel imprisoned not just by the Japanese soldiers but by the unforgiving jungle. It is an absolute must-see for any cinephile. Minor histories of this film, directed on a huge scale as usual by David Lean, is that it was furtively written by then blacklisted Hollywood filmwriters... but their credits have now been restored. It is a long film, but non stop riveting. Seisu Hayakawa's Col. Saito is absolutely memorable: &#34;I hate the British...!&#34; but of course Alec Guinness matches him.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Lawrence Krauss explains difficult concepts excellently and beautifully. The afterword by Richard Dawkins also sums things up nicely. It would seem we must reconsider what \\"nothing\\" is.
0316204366|4.0|Because I believe &#34;Success is NOT logical&#34;, I enjoy books like this one where the author provides insights that are counter-intuitive. Such is the case with David & Goliath.<br /><br />For many reasons I feel sorry for people who shun or ignore the Bible. Doing so limits their business potential. They won't purchase and read books like this one. They'll feel left out and uninformed when someone in a business meeting references David & Goliath, Noah & The Ark, or Daniel in the Lion's Den.<br /><br />I felt like many previous reviewers that this was a good book, not a great book. Although book sales are great.<br /><br />My primary take-a-ways were:<br />1. Giants are NOT what we think they are. Their source of strength is often their greatest weakness.<br />2. What we consider valuable often arises out of confronting an overwhelming issue.<br />3. Rick Patino became a great basketball coach using David-like tactics, e.g., the full-court press.<br />4. Monet, Renoir & Pissaro decided correctly to become &#34;Big Fish&#34; in a &#34;Small Pond&#34; instead of vice versa. Many college students make the career mistake of choosing to be a &#34;Small Fish&#34; in a &#34;Big Pond&#34; college.<br />5. Some of the most successful people are dyslexic, e.g., Richard Branson, attorney David Boies and Jet Blue's founder.<br />6. The Brownsville police chief lowered crime with hugs instead of guns.<br />7. The 3-Strikes Law in California was a simple failure. Mennonites successfully demonstrate that forgiveness reduces crime better than prison.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book has an outstanding reputation and for good reason... it's outstanding. It has a young adult literature feel to it. The story is simple and well told, like a well written computer program.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Makes a lot of sense. Helpful to start a conversation with spouse to refill the love tank, a useful concept
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A completely original novel, and a great read for anyone reading or learning about the Holocaust.  Also, you can just read it for fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Perfect for camping, tailgating, boating, or anywhere you think you may need to sharpen a knife.  The diamond rod for sharpening a serrated edge works beautifully.  Not sure how this little gem can be improved.
B0014JLYPQ|5.0|After 2 years of constant searing tailor bunion and nerve damage pain, followed by 8 months of post surgical and nerve damage pain, I finally found relief  with these heaven sent wonders!  I would give them at least 5 more stars if I could!  The Crocs on the RX line have an arch support that is in the right place for me and the unisex width holds my foot steady enough for normal  walking without rubbing when I wear socks. ( I don't think I will ever be able to wear a regular womens' size width again due to nerve damage.)  The soft  cushioned sole of these shoes give me so much relief that I can be on my feet for a  long day of shopping, housework, etc. without feeling like my feet are bruised and bleeding stumps.  I also do not wake up with aching feet from the previous day's adventures. I am currently working my way through the Crocs RX line.  Many, Many Thx Crocs.... from the bottom of my soles !
B00004YYDI|5.0|I love this movie!  The movie made me thinking about the life, love and trust. Also Reno acted very well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent introduction to an interesting and unique universe. Well put together and imagined. Definitely worth the read and deserving of the hype.
B00004WG2F|5.0|It's the first time I known Brad Pitt when I saw this movie. Although I went to see it all fro Anthony Hopkins. I love this story, especially the love between Tristan Ludlow and Susannah. By the way, the music of this movie is also attractive.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|Didn't think I was going to like it at first as the story is told from the horse's point of view but it was great!
B002EDH0FE|3.0|Extremely dark, and with interesting views on life. I found myself only getting involved with one of the characters, so the story felt a bit...off for me.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Best movie that I've seen in a long time.  It 's got as much heart as any Rocky movie.  New favorite movie.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Interesting and very thought-provoking.  Very relevant for our technology obsessed age and something that all teenagers and above should watch nowadays.  Who are you really chatting with online?
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Another example of fogerty's mastery of music perfection!  A must for any fan, a have to for your collection! Must see in person if you can
B005HEPN06|3.0|Seasons 1-3 are available on Amazon Prime in HD.  Seasons 4-7 are not.  The picture quality in Season 4 is HORRIBLE compared to the HD season 3.  Come on Amazon.  You got the first three seasons in HD.  How about the rest?
034580404X|5.0|Love them!! Can't wait for the movie to be out!! Definitely an exciting, exotic read! Great story line as well! The author definitely has a vivid imagination!! Hope she continues the story somehow!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I started this book yesterday morning and finished it last night. Stephen King does not disappoint his readers. You are immediately drawn into the story. I thought I might read The Shining again as it has been many years since I read it, but decided against it. There was no need to do that since as you read Doctor Sleep, your memories of the Shining come back, sometimes hauntingly, and you are anxious to read about Danny's journey into adulthood.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Yes and no....I enjoyed the character depth in the book better than the movie, but I missed the action and special effects from the film.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|It was a typical movie with a common outcome.  The graphics were cool, but nothing spectacular.  Typical kind of super hero movie.  Maybe the second one is better.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading and I never wanted it to end. Every sentence is a masterpiece I standing alone. It will be hard to wait another ten years for her next book.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very exiting,great acting.Swearing maybe a little over the top.Denzel is great in any movie.Ending was a complete surprise.Would recommend  to the adult crowd.
B003B02O7I|3.0|I'm a nine to five man, go to bed at nine and get up at five.  This book kept me up until midnight. The surprise ending was great.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Usually I am not a fan of family sagas, but over the last few months I had my attention drawn to Christoph Fischer's 'The Three Nations Trilogy' and had seen a number of very complimentary reviews.<br /><br />So being the perverse individual that I am, I decided to start with the last book in the series, 'The Black Eagle Inn', which is set against the backdrop of twentieth century Germany.<br /><br />Fischer paints a picture of a wounded country, its people dealing with collective shame and guilt while trying to come to terms with a changing world. Bavaria, where most of the action takes place, is portrayed as a retrograde backwater, where traditions and old prejudices run deep.<br /><br />The Hinterberger family are an obsessive bunch. The matriarch, Anna, is determined to keep control of the family lands and the Black Eagle Inn, at whatever cost to her personal relationships. Her brother, Hans-Ulrich, cannot see beyond the short-sightedness of his own religious bigotry, which drives away and alienates his children. The feuding and squabbling of the Hinterberger clan continues over decades, while their dreams die around them, and the world moves on regardless. They continue to shampoo the family rug while others progressively pull it out from underneath them.<br /><br />There are fascinating vignettes of family power, almost all of which lead to disillusionment and corruption. There is little love in this family, although Maria - the youngest of Hans-Ulrich's daughters - does manage to balance a degree of personal happiness with career success.<br /><br />I enjoyed Christoph Fischer's clinical narrative. His writing has a degree of alienation about it, and he pins his characters mercilessly to the wall like so many butterflies in an unusual collection. It doesn't feel like fiction: it feels like a 'real' family history. In spite of the unattractive personalities of many of the individuals in this book, I found I had to keep reading to see how all the various sub-plots were resolved. Fascinating stuff and well executed.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of this series.ots were resolved. Fascinating stuff and well executed.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of this series.
B007CF2TW8|5.0|Pros: Good build quality, fast, silent, blue led, accurate and solid performance, it looks amazing, I'm very satisfied with my purchase...<br /><br />Cons: No cons, maybe the price but, worth it...
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the story ; the characters! See them both, take others, make life be inclusive of entertainment and root for a winner
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This film is perfect. Couldn't have been any better. Hilarious, tons of great plants and payoffs. I enjoy it more each time I watch it.
B00FQMZ5M0|2.0|Completely unoriginal and very disappointing.  Not even my five year old daughter was swayed by this.  Possibly the least compelling Disney movie since the Parent Trap remake.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is book has made it to at least my top 5 favorite books. It sucks you in immediately and gets even better as you read on. The 1980s nostalgia is perfect.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This is a simple true story, portrayed by the actual people who lived it and punctuated with their haunting music.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I love this movie, one of my favorites. Love the english charm that surrounds it of course. Beatrix Potter classic story creations.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Great story, all the way until the end. I honestly just feel like she got bored of writing the story and threw together the ending in ten minutes. This book ruined the rest of the trilogy for me.
B00G32OER4|3.0|This was a good attempt at a creepy movie, however I felt that you would start to get scared, and then it would cut to a non-freaky scene. All in all it was decent, but they could have kept the suspense going better.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. It explains why every life is important, the hole that would be left if any of us were not here. It shows the value of hard work and thrift, but also exposes the evil that ensues in the absence of life guided by a strong moral compass. George Bailey vs Old man Potter, good verses evil. George and people like him make it possible to have a Bedford Falls where people are basically good, hard working, prosperous, and compassionate. Mr. Potter and his kind would change the town into Pottersville, a souless, selfish, morally bankrupt community.
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|I really enjoyed playing this game, but $4.99 is a little too much to pay. Seeing how this game isn't endless and that the amount of time they give you to finish a mission (just to get a star) isn't enough either, I think it should be at least $1.99.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|If you have never watched this, you really must. It helps you recall the magic of Christmas and it appeals to all ages. I watch it one time each year.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I mean, without a doubt one of the best shows in history.  Very violent, but we don't mind that.  Writing is superb.  Always jealous of those who haven't seen it because they get to start from the beginning.
B00G32TD98|3.0|atmospheric, with some good chills, but lots of clichés and mediocre performances by the cast.  some unintentional laugh-out-loud lines in the script don't add to the overall sense of mystery or horror.  this film probably works better for viewers who believe there are actually genuine spookologists who set up equipment in haunted houses and net results other than paychecks from their gullible clients or material for books and B movies.  Personally, I prefer scary movies that require me to suspend believe, rather than invest it...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very useful and easy to use. Totally recommend it to anyone. Always available when I need it because I have it on my Kindle and cellphone.
1608862801|5.0|This had all the nonsensical humor and sensitivity I see in the cartoon and introduced more fun characters for me to love.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Best read ever!  Could not put it down. A definite tear jerker.  I can't wait to read her next book.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|This is perfect for Toddlers.  The pieces are easy to identify and the sounds are terrific! A great vocabulary building puzzle.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Horrible.  The acting is terrible (particularly the actor who played the main antagonist... unfortunate.), and the costume designs are so terribly ludicrous as to make one wonder how they were ever approved for the film.. the costumes of the aliens are so ridiculous-looking that it makes it impossible to take anything these terrible actors are saying seriously.  I tried three times to watch far enough into the movie that the plot may become interesting enough to outweigh the film's drawbacks, but ultimately was unable to sit through it.  And a word of warning to any fans of Hong Kong cinema out there... the hand-to-hand combat is exceptionally slow and lackluster, and the fight choreography amateurish at best- it reminds me of the barroom brawls in old TV westerns like \\"Gunsmoke\\" (although Gunsmoke had the advantage of being written by people with a grasp of how to tell an interesting story).  I don't expect fight choreography by anyone in Hollywood to match that of Lau Kar-Leung or Sammo Hung, but the painfully slow, brainless, oafish fight scenes in movies like this one and the most recent Batman film are downright embarrassing. This film is so terrible it actually makes my memories of those god-awful Christopher Reeve movies seem fond.  I would rather be locked inside a steel cage with angry, rabid ferrets and rolled down a steep hill into a river of lemon juice than to ever be subjected to this abomination again...
141694737X|5.0|My daughter loves this book and has a hard time destroying the flaps as she practices her fine motor skills. She requests this as her nighttime book pretty frequently (though not nearly as often as Goodnight Moon or Giraffes Can't Dance).
B00G91WB3S|5.0|I saw the first big screen version with Christopher Reeve in the theater in 1983 when I was 9 and loved it, but I thought this latest Superman movie was great. True enough to the story line from the comics while incorporating elements from previous big screen versions. The special effects were top notch, good acting for the most part, and good tempo throughout. Best one to date in the many releases.
0783229526|5.0|Johnny Depp was born to play this role.  This movie never gets old.  The book was great and usually they ruin it with a movie version but not this one.  It is like being in a crazy rollercoaster of a trip the whole time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its fun and hard to put down once you start. Love it. Good for anybody to play.Keeps your mind working.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|There are many movies about the Civil War but this one is different.  It is heart warming and sad at the same time.  It makes you think about what you would do during that time and put yourself in the characters shoes.  No matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me cry.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a beautiful, marvelous love story! It made me cry to the point of sobbing but good job John Green, keep them coming!!!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Came earlier than expected and just as the seller described.  I have never been a huge Elijah Wood fan (until Green Street Hooligans) but he did a great job in this movie.  I highly recommend it.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Daughter got this for her birthday and she is absolutely in love with her. Catty is now my daughter's favorite Monster High. The clothes, the look, everything about catty is fabulous. Would recommend to any Monster high fan!!!! A great collector's item too.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Jim Carrey did a great job in a serious role.  This was a sweet yet sad movie.  It also made you think about the insanity that occurred after WWII in Hollywood regarding the &#34;communist witch hunt&#34;.  Such a great movie.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This is a present for my stepbrother. He absolutely loves the Spartacus TV Show, and wanted this for his birthday. I got it for him, and the first day he watched it, and has already seen it all the way through. The packaging is great, and the discs are in great condition. For any Spartacus fan, this is a definite must have. Blu ray is excellent as well!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful book! John Grisham can really keep you in suspense until the very end. He puts a different twist to each book he writes.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!  I love this Superman more than any of the other's before it. My son who was 6 at the time watched this movie for the first time as a family, and he fell in love with Superman. He has seen a couple of the other Supermans, but when he watched this film, now Superman is his hero. He wanted it for his birthday, but unfortunately this came out after his birthday, so I said that it will be late. He was sad, but okay. We just received it yesterday, and he wanted to watch it immediately. He is so excited, the case is absolutely wonderful. It is very durable, and a great collectible. I love having this up on display. Great packaging, the movies are in excellent condition.<br />Like I said before, this is by far the best Superman ever!!! Thank you so much and keep up the great work.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|loved this movie as well as the cast didnt expect to enjoy it as much as i did.  so enjoyed the story line.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this movie. I quote Belt all the time. I even watch this movie in my spare time, and I am 29 years old. Great family movie, made me laugh, cry and all around great time!!!  I think EVERYONE should get this movie, especially if they love to spend time with their family. :) The 3D is fabulous, and the blu ray is just as great.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have several books on my android phone and it is so convenient, I can read anywhere I am.  It's great for the pattern books too, I won't misplace them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a real fan of the series. Wish that you had a price for seeing each and every one of them.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|This book was tough.  When I heard about the basic premise, I couldn’t wait to read it.  With a handful of interesting characters and some clever usage of virtually limitless potential storylines, this could have been a real humdinger.  Instead it reads like the script of a made-for-TV movie that could appear on the Syfy network just as easily as the Hallmark Channel or the Oprah Winfrey Network.  I wasn’t sure if I would make it through the first 50 pages, but eventually you grow numb to the absurd and un-relatable world Eggers describes in The Circle and, if you’re like me, you eventually fall into a rhythm flipping through the pages hoping for a fun payoff—ideally some terrible fate befalling the story’s awful main character.<br /><br />One could debate if intent excuses any of these ills.  I say no.  The people and settings in this story are too ridiculous and detached from our reality and too internally inconsistent to advance any kind of interesting underlying message.  And, as many others have commented, NOTHING is hidden in this book.  Every plot development has miles of advance warning and nothing comes as a surprise.<br /><br />And it really does seem lazy.  The universe created by Eggers just isn’t well thought-out.  Maybe it’s not a big deal, but one particular vignette really drove me crazy.  The Circle is a place where many employees have data projected directly onto their retinas, where tiny cameras can transmit ultra-HD images to a satellite around the clock for years on a single battery charge, where the entire environment is built from the ground up to harness the company’s incredible wealth and technological resources, yet—without a hint of irony or acknowledgment—Eggers equips The Circle’s luxurious employee dormitories with a “stereo”.<br /><br />  “He drank the rest of his sake and got up to adjust the stereo.”<br /><br />There aren’t speakers embedded in the walls?  Or bone-conducting audio technology in the furniture, that transmits the sound through your skeleton?  And you have to get up to adjust it, like a caveman?  You can’t control it from your phone?<br /><br />Also, I get the joke with the ever-growing number of screens on Mae’s desk, but it doesn’t really make any sense and is incongruous with the technology that The Circle supposedly possesses.<br /><br />The review on Wired.com says all this better than I did.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love the series so much and this is a sad but amazing end to the trilogy.  Juat an outstanding book series
B00BWQW73E|3.0|If you're even remotely interested in how Amazon came to be, then this is a great, quick read.  You get lots of colorful vignettes about Mr. Bezos but he still feels like a distant figure.  The stories of Amazon's earliest days seemed a little rushed--it felt like we were in the garage one moment and then toasting the IPO the next.
B003G4W49C|5.0|this is a great book about giftedness disguised as a science fiction book for kids.  Loved it as a child and even more as an adult.

B005JE7XW0|4.0|It is just a one joke movie but it does it right. I've enjoyed it a few times. Probably watch it again.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Awesome movie. Cant stop watching it, this special edition is dope and the disks look amazing. Just like they were actuall burned and hand written.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This was a brilliant page-turner, full of references familiar to New Yorkers, with a highly unusual plot and several fascinating characters.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Boring book, way too much detail about irrelevant material. The ending was very anti climatic which was extremely dissapointing after one mundane chapter after another
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I really like Facebook page and I love playing the games that Facebook has and I can talk to my friends and family

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Allegiant ruined the entire series for me. I get angry just thinking about it. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this horrible book.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I never watched any trailers/previews for this movie.  As such, the storyline wasn't as I expected based on the title of the movie, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise.  Denzel has always been a fantastic actor and continues his craft in this movie.
B00006B1HH|5.0|My mother's favorite movie has rubbed off on me. Get a group of boys and girls, split them up and sing Summer Nights...lol
B00005NTJK|1.0|Very poor remaster. Sound is very thin. Bass almost nonexistent. Worst remastering of a classic recording that Ihave ever heard. Very disappointed.
B00008YZYM|5.0|Prefer this remake to the older version. The movie is so funny and the soundtrack is awesome. Why didn't they cast Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen as the twins...don't get me wrong. Lindsay Lohan is great but I was just wondering....
B003PTP4S6|5.0|It's a great CD. I listen to it all the time. It's a timeless and endless CD that will always radiate
B003G4W49C|5.0|Upon rereading this book after many years, it is still one of the best psychological dramas out there.  The characters are very well done.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|I found the behind the scenes extremely insightful. Very pleased with this product. Good packaging. I'm a happy customer. To those who love Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf, I recommend this to be in your movie collection.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|OK sci-fi flick.  Cruise is a pretty good actor.  Wasn't sure if it was going to be any good, but was pleasantly surprised.
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|this is one of my christmas list items and it was a very good item at a good price, thank you. this is the tv show from when i was a kid and they are not so bad as are the ones on today tv. i would rather pay to buy good things for kids to watch than to allow them to see the evil and bad tv shows of today.

B004EPYZQC|5.0|Paul Walker is just so delicious. I have been in love with him from Pleasantville era. The Fast and the Furios series minus Tokoyo Drift are one of my favorites. Can't go wrong with Paul Walker or Vin D. I could care less about the plot I just watch for eye candy but the movie is good too.

B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love Disney and I love Toy Story. I saw this movie when I was in high school in the theatre and loved it. Now that I have my own child and I am forced to watch all these weird shows I started to introduce my son to my generation and before of movies. We started with classics like Dumbo and Pinnachio. It's amazing the messages these movies have in them, I never really realized before. Needless to say my son is a huge fan of the Toy Story Triology too.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I LOVE this game but it keeps shutting down on me!!! If they fix a couple bugs, i might a couple i would give it total 5 stars!! This game is AWESOME , great graphics, great racing, nice tracks, cool cars, DOWNLOAD THIS GAME, but beware of a couple glitches because of the awesomeness
B0001I561E|5.0|4th grade every one wanted to sing &#34;A Whole New World&#34; in the talent shows. I love Aladin and I enjoy watching with my son.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|It was a great movie with awesome fight scenes and never kept me bored. Would definitely recommend it to anyone
B004LWZW42|5.0|I love X-Men and this was a great installment of how they started off. I am also a huge fan of James McAvoy. Good movie.
B00FCAK12A|5.0|As the Places Burn was always a awesome album but with the reissue you can hear everything more clear. From the drums to the guitars. The musicianship of this guys have always blown me away. The documentary was awesome. It was great  to get a inside look at the making of this beast of an album.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|When I was a little girl this was my first favorite Disney movie! I always wanted to reenact the spaghetti scene too. It's still one of my favorites and I like to watch with my little guy like my dad used to watch with me.
B0055B0MIO|5.0|I have always been a fan of the musicianship of Trivium and this album has a bunch of solid songs. They are great live and they are keeping real metal alive. Great Record and the documentary was awesome.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love the way King ties in the Shining characters to this new book and adds new interesting characters that suck you into his world.
B00BV1P8NG|4.0|Not bad for the price, And could be a collectors item in the future. The finish is a little on the cheap side but Derpy items are rare so that makes up for it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is great. You can easily advance without spending much money. This game is challenging. Hidden object games are the best. This company really knows what they are doing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I don't know how we missed out on The Good Wife when it first appeared, but my wife and I both love the show and have been watching it on Amazon Prime!  There are several plots running in parallel in any given episode, some long running and some simply the case of the week.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very good<br />The book was written very well and kept me in suspense the whole time
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show... I love watching it... it keeps you wanting to see the next one right away! Love it! Highly Recommended!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have never read this book!! Can't believe I am 34 and never was told how charming this book is! It did take me about one third of the book before falling in love with it. Oh, but how I enjoyed it all!! It is inspiring, thoughtful, loving, fun, romantic, and more!! I am so glad to have read this classic!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen. This book gave me more to love about her. I got new insights about her comedy I didn't have before and her life. Anyone who doesn't know Ellen well but would like to know more should read this book.  Ellen fans who haven't read this book, well then shame on you!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This final book in the series completely shocked me!! There where a lot of twists in it and it pretty much changed the way that i look at the first two books. I really enjoyed the book and i am very sad about the way it ended. But in the end i think it was a great book to end a great trilogy!!!
B0070DQZ86|1.0|The movie froze over half way thru. it wouldn't let me watch anymore. I even tried resetting amazon. I wish I had that money back. I had this same problem awhile back.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I love stories that are unpredictable, and that's what you get when you read Solstice. It's an absolute intriguing mystery. You get so drawn into the story that you can't put the book down. I must say that I read it in one sitting. The details just pull you in and don't let you go. The twist and turns keep you glued to every part of the story. If you like a mysterious and captivating stories then this is the story for you. I highly recommend it. You will be glad that you read it. I guarantee it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am still reading this book, but so far I find that many of the insights provided by Sandberg have resonated with some of my own thought and behavior patterns.  This book really raises valuable points that open the door to greater discussions about the real need for female leadership in key positions of influence. As a young female executive I was fortunate enough to have a more seasoned female colleague recommend this book to me, My only regret is that this book was not available 7 years ago when I got my first supervisory promotion!!!!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Fun so to kill time even though it can be a money sink. I like the lan play option with a forth coming online multi player option.
B00GHJ1S2M|5.0|Love the music.  Lady Gaga is great and I love Amazon Cloud Player for all my digital music.  Amazon helps with organizing all my digital music that I purchase.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|keep thinking there is going to be a slide to mediocrity at some point but the surprises, thrills, dramatic tension just keep coming.  there are several series I watch but this is the only one that is a must see.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT ON TV JUST WANTED IT FOR MY COLLECTION NICE TO NO WHERE I CAN GO TO GET THE MERCHANDISE THAT I AM LOOKING FOR WITHOUT SAYING OUT OF STOCK
B001IF277K|5.0|My son's cell phone battery was dying out quickly.  After purchasing this product, he hasn't had any problems with his cell phone.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I purchased this as a reference CD to use for a film I was making.  It served its purpose and I watched twice.  Now I was to sell it back.  Any takers?
B00361R2VU|3.0|Yawn, it was okay, predictable
0451208706|3.0|Gave it as a gift, I didn't hear anything negative about it.  But it's likely sitting on a shelf collecting dust.
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|This band has really tightened up their game with this album. Great music, vocals, lyrics, and mixing. I listened to this album non-stop after I first bought it, hard hitting, great breakdowns, love the voice-none of that girly singing on the choruses (can't stand all these new bands that start heavy and then start choir boy singing, pussies!) Can't wait for more from these guys!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I was really stoked and excited to download this game.  I was really in love with the graphics and vocals.  Love hearing Jarvis's voice on my phone.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|My niece downloaded this game and I played it from time to time. Well I tried buying coins for this game and it took the money out of my account but I never received them for the game I tried contacting customer support and never received anything so I tried it again bought some more coins the note said error please redownload this game so I did and now my game is gone and so is my  money. I not a happy customer :/// I would also like to add I gave this game two stars because I did enjoy playing it, it would of got 4 if it had not ripped me off. I would really appreciate if they would reimburse me the two payments of 1.99.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing, heartfelt, snarky story. I loved it! I have already recommended this to many other people. You won't want to put this down.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Such a challenge that I had to stop playing.  Cannot get beyond level 245 after a month of trying to move on.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Who doesn't like the original Toy Story?<br /><br />After finding out that my 3 year old grandson did not know who Buzz Lightyear was I was compelled to buy this.  Of course he loves the movie and we watch it almost every time he visits.
0452289963|5.0|One of a handful of books that I would (and have) read more than once. In fact, I find I'm in a better frame of mind when I read a section each morning. This is one of my favorite books, even better than the Power of Now IMO - less repetitive, more depth. GET IT GET IT GET IT :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a retired healthcare worker who has heard of near death experiences from a couple patients.  I found this book espec compelling given it was written by a doctor...a neurosurgeon...who was (literally) deathly ill.  Some of the medical terminology may be foreign to non-medical readers but he does a nice job of explaining the terms.  It was a great read and I came away from it 'liking' the author thru his personal accounts of his own family, disease, and experience.  NDEs are impossible to prove but this book makes it harder to dismiss such accounts.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Releasing Boulders from a swinging Tongue at enemy Tanks, Helicopters, etc. is surprisingly Fun.<br />You have to get the Release Timed properly to cause the most damage.  It's a simple concept but can be quite challenging with well designed scenes that require varying strategies.  The Boulder swings from the Kings Tongue and you Tap screen to release it.  There are Dynamite boxes that you can explode to help you.  Many obstacles to get around by changing Trajectory strategy.  The Physics are good and Graphics are simple but Decent.  Smooth movements and realistic physics results most of the time.  No Stars to play for but you get ACHIEVMENT Awards instead for better plays.<br /><br />Overall, a Great game that tests your Timing and Physics skills.  Lots of fun with smooth gameplay.  I have other games from Developer (10 Tons) like Azkend, Holding Hands, Tennis in the Face and they are all very good and safe games.  This one is a good addition and seems well designed.  It is SAFE with Reasonable Permissions and No Annoyances.  It does have FLURRY Analytics but I OPTED OUT through  their website.  App can be played with WiFi OFF also.  I have seen occasional freeze-ups on my Motorola Xoom Tablet.  This happens on with some of their other apps but not all the time.  This app is uniquely Enjoyable so I recommend it.  It is 10 TONS OF FUN (ha-ha).
B003E6LC6I|5.0|From the first episode to the season finale, we were totally enthralled. No wonder Glen Close won Emmys for her performances. Rose Byrne, too, continued to emerge as a woman of strength and cunning, as she slowly took on many of Close's character traits--positive and negative. This was a well-written, well-directed season and we constantly watched more than one episode at a time, couldn't wait to see what would transpire next.
B002SWQXRM|4.0|It's a pretty doofy movie. I love it anyway. It's a lot of fun despite the ridiculous Goldblum hacking scenes. Also, I'm going to watch it with Rifftrax, but I haven't yet.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm not fond of the ending at all. I think it was done to shock rather than to enhance the book. If I had known this is how it would end I probably wouldn't have read the other books.
B000NA28I4|1.0|The books got progressively better as Paulini grew up. This movie starts even lower than the writing of an aspiring 13 year old boy. Jeremy Irons is good, though. I'd say that without reading the book, the movie is stupid and hard to follow. If you've read the book, on the other hand, the movie is stupid and hard to follow. This movie is unwatchable without Rifftrax commentary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting I love it. I can't stop playing it.  Nothing else to say.  Love it. 1
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Amazing show the cast is well chosen the plot always engaging and close to real life. A must see !
B006YTTVHO|4.0|its an okay book didn't finish because it was a bit too simple to read its like a power point
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Fantastic final book to the Divergent series. I went through nearly all emotions while reading this book. Veronica Roth writes another book that I wish went on forever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this all the time, it's a great app. It's accurate, gives you all the info you need, includes all the warnings, which is important where I live. It's easy to use, provides the forecast a week ahead. Not a lot of frills, just a good, reliable weather app.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I tried this app and really like it. It comes in handy and that is why. Would recommend this app.
B00D48BSBA|4.0|As always Fredrick shines in creating a thriller ..fast paced and engrossing till the end.must read for its contemporary setting
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was good, not one of his best a little predictable. Good characters and story line moved well. Lots of details.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you read The Shining, you need to read this.  Closes the loop and extends the story.  Could be more given where this one ends.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Best Superman movie ever to this date. Old Superman movie will always be classic and best. This one is the Greater one as a present. Totally worth buying it. Great Story and Great Cast. Superman the movie is also best movie too however Man of Steel is not trying to ruin or replacing the old Superman. It is good reboot with some new story and change is also good too. I wanted something new and better action and this is one you should have give a chance cos it is great movie and watch it with open mind.<br /><br />This blu-ray is Region Free i have test it and it work with Australian Blu-ray player.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fascinating saga.  Sometimes the story drags a bit because author is obsessive about trivial detail, but a good read if you're patient.

B004MOQAU4|5.0|In my view, one of the best films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Despite its length, the movie fascinates the audience. Definitely, a master piece! If you enjoy this movie, you should watch &#34;Marketa Lazerova&#34;, directed by Frantisek Vlácil.
6304011431|5.0|I loved this movie, and my little granddaughter will love this as well; although, she no longer has access to the VCR, now, I guess I'll have to get the DVD, huh.  A wonderful story.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Brilliant, engaging portrayal of a pivotal time in US and global history. Rich details.  Steady pace. Lots to think about.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I have recently discovered Harry Bosch and enjoy the character and the authors style.  I'm tired of mystery, police procedural books that are so focused on the blood and guts and not so much on the procedural part of it.  I've been skipping thru the series publications dates and find them all enjoyable.<br />Nice to find an author with enough books to keep me reading thru the winter.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I loved Sigh no More so I jumped on getting this album. In my opinion, it's not as good as Sigh no More. The last 3 songs are the best songs on the album and that does not include I will wait, which everyone knows from the radio.
B00C5R8364|3.0|Video Game Fiction<br /><br />In full disclosure, I admit this is not the kind of book I normally enjoy, and I review it at the risk of being somewhat disrespectful of Mr. Forsyth, who apparently is a master of his genre. This is an old fashioned, Saturday matinee thriller with one-dimensional characters, where the good guys are all good and the bad guys are awful, and there is no character development to indicate otherwise - nor are there any women characters, or mushy love scenes. It is all guts and glory, the kind of thing I would have loved at the age of ten.  A Saturday matinee, though, that is brought up to date by billions of dollars worth of the world’s very best equipment to support a multination plan to get the bad guy. This bad guy is an American trained Middle Easterner, nicknamed “The Preacher”, who’s hate of America is broadcast from some unknown location, and supposedly instrumental in convincing both American and British youth to take up arms and kill their countrymen. After more than a half dozen of these events, the hero - in person of a super-qualified Marine Lt. Colonel is called in, given the old 007 “license to kill”, and told to neutralize this awful pest. For this task, any equipment or Allied help needed will be available, and money is no object.  From there it is pretty much a video game of seek and kill, with a slight side plot about Somali pirates. The Preacher was found, with the help of an Asperger’s Syndrome hacker, to be hiding in Somalia. Cutting quickly to the end (truly a matinee classic bit), after the most expensive and high tech chase conceivable (involving also an elite British killer unit), it finally comes down to the hero and the bad guy in a hand-to-hand knife fight, and as the wounded hero looks into the eyes of the dastardly villain, and slips the Marine knife into into his heart , he whispers “Semper Fi, Preacher!”.<br /><br />This is excellent book for those who like this kind of thing. My reason for reading it was to find out more about the latest phase of warfare, involving high tech communication and drones. This goal was accomplished, and emphasized how much change there has been since, as an artillery officer I communicated by hastily laid land lines, solved the required gunnery trig by hand, and sent out to the target 30 lb, 105mm rounds that cost about a dollar per pound. The escalation in method and cost of war in one lifetime is astounding!eading it was to find out more about the latest phase of warfare, involving high tech communication and drones.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was not as good as the first two, it felt like the author dug herself a whole at the end of book two and had no where to go
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It was a better book than his past.  Overall, I was pleased, but in hindsight (having read all but one of Grisham'sbooks - a TBoone book) I would wait for the paperback.  However, I hope he keeps at it as he is writing or plotting better.
145210655X|4.0|Darth Vader and Son is a delightful and clever children’s comic book that is well conceived and worthwhile entertainment for children and adults alike.<br /><br />Set up as a series of illustrated tableaus from the life of a Darth Vader who, instead of learning only mid-way through Empire Strikes Back that Luke Skywalker is his son, is the single father of a four-year old Luke (featuring a cameo from the other Skywalker twin, Leia–oops! Spoiler alert! Luke and Leia are siblings!), the book opens with a title page that spoofs the flowing titles and prologue that we’ve come to know as the standard opening of George Lucas’ blockbuster Star Wars films.<br /><br />Each page is a colorfully drawn picture, scenes that every Star Wars fan will recognize. Brown’s art is simple, focusing on depicting the setting with only minor changes from the original. Rather, his wry drawings are just enough to both satirize and shed a humorous light on otherwise serious and pivotal scenes. The conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor by holographic transmission is interrupted by a nattering Luke. In another, Luke trick or treats in the costume of a Storm Trooper while Mon Mothma asks “Aren’t you a little short for a storm trooper?”<br /><br />Darth_Vader_and_Son-300x300The Prequel Trilogy doesn’t escape Brown’s jabs either, especially Jar Jar Binks. “That’s not the toy you’re looking for,” says a hand waving Vader. “Yes, it is,” replies young Luke, proving he is not among the weak-minded. It’s a sly commentary on the generational split in opinions about the first and second Star Wars trilogies.<br /><br />While each scene pokes fun at Star Wars, it is without malice or mockery. Rather, it is tongue-in-cheek and by the hand of someone who clearly loves Star Wars. Brown knows that Han shot first, that children keep adults grounded and from taking ourselves too seriously, and recognizes that all the things we older Star Wars fans hate are the same things that kids love, from Ewoks to JarJar Binks.<br /><br />As I flipped the pages, I chuckled, smiled, and laughed. Then my five-year old saw the book sitting on my bed stand, and she laughed, too. She wouldn’t put the book down after I finished it, and it isn’t for lack of other books to read. After she fell asleep, I found the book under her arm, and this afternoon she informed me that it would be accompanying her to school for ‘show and tell’ tomorrow.<br /><br />If it can make my daughter laugh as much as it does me, it will be a great addition to our shelves.ings that kids love, from Ewoks to JarJar Binks.<br /><br />As I flipped the pages, I chuckled, smiled, and laughed.

B000024KBK|3.0|Well, the reviews show that it's a very polarizing album, so as is often the case in volatile topics, I find myself somewhere in the middle.  Is it the worst Morrissey album?  In my opinion, no...<br /><br />And of course, my opinion is all it can be.  Music is very subjective.  People attacking each other for liking or not liking an album is childish.  I liked parts of it, I didn't like other parts of it.  That's my take on it.<br /><br />I will say that, after Viva Hate and Bona Drag, this is the first Morrissey album that didn't blow me away and the last one that I purchased brand new without listening to it first.  I really enjoyed the tracks &#34;Our Frank&#34; and &#34;Mute Witness&#34; quite a bit, but then things didn't come together for me like his previous solo work had.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't recommend it to a non-fan, but there are some bright spots here.  It's hard to maintain the level of perfection that Viva Hate and Bona Drag had established.
B009P1WES6|5.0|It is a book with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase and very hard to put down once you start reading it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This tiny device rocks! My laptop, with all of my music from forever converted to mp3s, has a sad, lightweight sound card. I thought my old Sennheiser HD 280 pros or my ears were just worn out. The FiiO woke up my ears and the headphones. Worth every penny. If you let the internal battery discharge, it will sound like it doesn't work or is weak. Keep it charged and there will be no problem. It has a couple of preset e.q. settings. Use whatever makes your sound the best for you. I also plugged it into my ancient Yamaha DTX explorer drum machine brain and it kicks butt on that too.
B0062162N0|5.0|So many twist and turns. Can't wait for the next episode. What will happen next. Who will be in the next show or not????
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is just like bejeweled, but with candy instead of jewels. It's very entertaining and addicting. I recommend this app for ages 8-30. I guarantee you'll love this app!:)
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Absolutely her best album. The best song is &#34;Birthday&#34;. The second best is &#34;This is how we do&#34;<br /><br />  I love Katy!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Good tool, easy to use. I would give 5 stars but one option is missing. While with astro manager you can use it to attach files to email  this is nowhere to find. Otherwise it's great
0307719774|3.0|I like this journal but it falls short in execution.  The writing prompts are mostly good (they can't all be winners) but the lack of true writing space holds me back.  Three short lines (in an already small book) makes for better notes than an actual journal.  Hard to write clear memories when forced to write in such a small space.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I bought this for my parents and they are loving it!  After our family got all caught up on Downton utilizing Amazon Prime instant TV, I thought they might enjoy this set!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have enjoyed almost every Grisham novel, and this one follows his great formula of moving me to every next page.  The character development is flawless; character action and interaction very real.
0316055433|2.0|This was a huge disappointment, for me anyway. The opening New York sections were excellent, but once things move to Las Vegas the story takes a seriously wrong turn. I have to wonder for whom Tartt thinks she's writing. Does she really imagine that intelligent adult readers are going to be enthralled with hundreds of pages detailing the antics of a pair of burned-out druggie teenagers who spend their time smoking weed, swilling vodka, and dining on packets of sugar and whatever delicacies they can steal from the local supermarket? Well, perhaps they will, the book *is* on the NYT besteller list. But once all the hype and interviews die down...who knows? The comparisons to Dickens are particularly inappropriate. Dickens wrote about orphans and others who are on the receiving end of undeserved bad luck, but his characters struggle *against* degradation and dissipation. Here Theo and Boris revel in their moral squalor. (Boris is the kind of character who seems to exist only in books and movies: the burn-out loser druggie who is failing all his classes in school but is really a secret genius who reads Dostoevsky and Thoreau in his rare sober and lucid moments. Yeah...right. I went to high school. Burn outs are burn outs).<br /><br />Nor is there any hint of Dickens' wild and life-affirming humor. There's not a drop of wit in the book. No one even cracks a halfway decent dirty joke.<br /><br />Too bad. I gave up halfway though the book. There is just such an incredible ugliness about all (or almost all) of the characters that I found I didn't care a damn what happened to them and certainly didn't want to spend any more time with them. The ironic part is that Tartt is an incredible writer, a master of descriptive prose, attentive to detail and able to create a truly believable world on the page. Too bad it's such a rotten world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun I really enjoy playing it each level is exciting and tuff but it's fun
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love vampires. Another derivation on the angry birds genre. Cute graphics and music. I'm not that into mobile gaming but this is fun to pass the time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome my kids love it, All the different levels vehicles and upgrades. Defiantly will tell friends about it.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I love the emancipation of Mimi cd.  When I received it, I played it everytime I was in the car.  I don't buy cd's often but I had to have this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a really fun match three games. I love match three games and this is pretty high on the list . It is somewhat challenging takes allot of thinking.
B000UZQI0Q|2.0|I heard great things about the Mistborn stories.  Not impressed.  I will give credit for character and world development.  That was good.  The story itself; I just kept waiting for it to live up to the hype.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It was like the B version of MIB.  It was okay, should have waiting for it to come on Netflix, but glad I didn't go see it in the theater.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|u love Beach? well?? what r u waitin 4, Knee Grow?? These Knee Growz still got da skillz live. Saw them on their reunion romp in Hollywood,FL @ the Hard Rock. Just mindblowin stuff kids.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Great season! We love this show. Now we are all caught up and can watch season 9 on our DVR.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|May the odds be ever in your favor Katniss Everdeen<br />I love the idea of Katniss and I'm glad I'm like her because it makes me stronger and able to keep my own opinion <3 Shoot on
0792164903|4.0|An excellent re-telling of the Ichobod Crane legend. First rate acting by Johnny Depp (as always). Much more convoluted story than the original only makes the telling better.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|Best group of songs! I can listen to the entire CD over and over and not get tired of the songs.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved it! Most people don't like the ending but I thought I was a great way to end the series.
B00A993UWM|5.0|I love Ke$ha's dirty mouth, but she still has songs of substance that make me feel good while working out. She knocks down the double standards between men and women when it comes to sex and embraces her sexuality as a power in and of itself. My favorites were &#34;Crazy Kids&#34; and &#34;Gold Trans Am&#34; for being wild, and then for deeper thoughts and reflection I loved &#34;Out Alive&#34;, &#34;Wonderland&#34; and &#34;Past Lives&#34;.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great season! Still able to surprise me, which can be hard to do. Season 4 is well written with an intriguing story line.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|simply awesome if you havent seen this movie it is a must see!  the hulk and ironman shine throughout.  incredible in 3d as well
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|I would of given this 0 stars if I could, since it won't download!!!!!! I have tried to &#34;download it in the background&#34; ever since I bought the app.  It won't download!!!!  I have since read other reviews with the same issues. One or two reviews said it was a great game, unfortunately I will never know!!!!!!
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Straight forward, well written account of rhe life of this girl leading up to her callous shooting and recovery. She also provides a vivid historical and political background of life in Pakistan. A definite page turner. She Iis wise beyond her years.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|This movie was amusing and it's an interesting concept.  However it seems to be a bit of a &#34;Men in Black&#34; rip-off, with a brief nod to &#34;Ghost&#34;.  It's good for a few laughs.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Fun game with lovely pictures. I have played several of these and this is the nicest yet. I especially like the backgrounds. Thank you.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|it is a pretty good movie,  We watched as a family.  Very believable.  Good acting.  Would have been cool to see the set.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Her voice tells the complete story.  Was a pleasure to see her perform from the very beginning of her career.  The themesong from &#34;Titanic&#34; lauched her career to the level at which it now stands.  Will always be a pleasure to hear this &#34;True Entertainer&#34; perform sing and perform for her fanbase.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has created a masterpiece. This novel exceeded all expectations. Captivating from page one, the story will leave you intrigued and satisfied on multiple levels.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Classic Grisham novel - one of his bests works to date. There will certainly be a movie made for this one.
B003B02O0A|3.0|I like John Grisham, but this book was not as good as most of his work. it was however readable.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Too many glitches that are not being addressed, especially when it comes too the app freezing up and forcing a reload.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Underestimating the audience with unreal details. Denzel has performed this character so many times before it is a cliche for him.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|This book is very helpful especially the videos! Very easy to follow and healing of old issues. I have shifted with the EFT process.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Worked great! My nephew loved it! Though, it is a little hard to blow up. Over all, it is a great purchase.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The death of tris was a shock. The first 2 books were awesome and seemed to be leading up to the great ending for the series and it fell serious short.  For a character as strong as tris, if the author wanted her to die she could have given more thought to how she was killed. The story just kind of ended and it felt like it was only half way told. There should be an alternate ending written.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I'm not the first to say this and I won't be the last: too bad le Carre is known as one of the best spy novelists of our time, because that suit doesn't quite fit--it would be more true to say that he's one of the best novelists of our time. What I liked best about A DELICATE TRUTH are the speech signatures given each character. Read a few lines of dialogue in this dialogue-rich opus and the speaker is sharply defined as to social rank and psychological bent and becomes unforgettable. The cadences of idiomatic speech are thunderously vivid and they drive the reader forward though the twists and turns of a complicated plot.  Read this on a weekend when you haven't much else to do.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|The boys have again selected a wonderful group of songs and deliver them with their beautiful voices.  Listening to them is always a pleasure and this Album is a great addition to my collection of Christmas music to be played and replayed over the coming years..
B009ZE27US|1.0|I did not like it it was never right and it only has two stars I should of known not to get it I deleted It right away.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Great music! More than meets my expectations. Glad that I bought it! Now...more, please. Perfect mix of soul, rock, and hiphop.
