6305882592|5.0|In the days before DVDs and VCRs there was midnight movies.  This was the time when cult favorites such as  \\"King of Hearts\\" and \\"Harold and Maude\\" played week after week to packed houses.  The mantel was eventually passed on to \\"Rocky Horror picture show\\" but not before influencing millions of college kids looking for some answers to life's mysteries.  This moving is as wonderful today as it was when it first came out (early 70's?).  Don't miss it.
0140067477|2.0|I've been through this book a few times now.  I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right.  I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time.  Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone. <br /> <br />Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion.  It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.   <br /> <br />I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|I enjoyed the movie for the most part, yes the writing was off, but in the context of comic book it works. THe stylekized fight scenes also reminded me of comics. Also, don't get me wrong I love Milla, but this wasn't for her. Some one who looked a little more athletic like Jessica Biel from Blade 3. And towards the end the fight scenes started to look the same. I did like the homage to Shogan Assassin, not quite as good, but I appreciated to thought. I also read the review about Equilibrium (J. Falter) I don't get that at all Equilibrium was a better movie (which was a low budget movie as well, see; Equilibrium's special feature on the DVD) and I do agree with Agsded on this one, but you see alot of different movie in this one.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Realism at its most haunting, Munich is a multi-layered film addressing many issues. Although revenge is its central theme, an eye for an eye, the story is about nationalism, loyalty, the value of family and that thin line between killing in war and plain murder outside the so-called war arena.<br /><br />The film begins in Munich during the Olympic games. As is well known to those who were living at the time, Palestinians stormed the Olympic village and took the Israeli team hostage. As the world watched the tragedy unfold on their television sets, most were hopeful that the outcome would be without bloodshed and death. As a child I remember distinctly staring at the television in a kind of shock, and after the hostages had been murdered, experiencing terrible nightmares for some time. To be sure, I was not alone with these feelings - this was not a movie but real death.<br /><br />The film does an excellent job of representing this tragedy.<br /><br />The scene changes and the Israeli Prime Minister is confronted with a difficult decision. Although bombing Palestinian villages in retaliation, somehow this was not enough, thus she gives the order to assassinate, one by one, the perpetrators directly responsible.<br /><br />The Australian actor, Eric Bana, portrays the young Israeli solider who must disconnect from his home, his family and his government, acting as a rogue killer, however financed by the government. In other words, if he is caught, no country or government will take responsibility - like many undercover operatives one reads about, he is on his own. The reason for the covert operation is that it is illegal, against many international laws. The story moves on and he has a team of unusual characters, all loyal to the Israeli cause, to hunt down those responsible for Munich.<br /><br />The settings are many - Rome, London, France, Athens and New York - all beautifully photographed.<br /><br />What I found most astounding was the realism of the film; the killings felt too real, the fear, trepidation, guilt and sadness of all the characters felt palpable. The film's end is a wonderful piece of acting and writing.<br /><br />Generally not a big fan of Spielberg films, this one was a visceral experience, lasting because of its realism and the important issues it raises. The central issue, the occupied territories, the never-ending murder and mayhem, leaves the viewer, not directly involved in that war, wondering when or if a reconciliation will ever occur.<br /><br />A thinking film and superb in all respects.tion, guilt and sadness of all the characters felt palpable.

B000002J6F|5.0|This was originally a double-album which I played so often that the inner sleeves, the jacket and finally even the two records simply wore away.  It's a credit to current technology that all of that can fit onto one compact disk.  Fans of CSNY and all of their permutations should consider this a must since the songs and the music do not seem nearly as dated as much as other seventies recordings.  At the time this record was made the Moog synthesizer had only been around a few years and was more prominent in other pop groups like ELP, but here that sound serves the ensemble of Manassas extraordinarily well.  There was no shortage of talent in this band and each player is or was an accomplished musician.  It's noted in the Crosby Stills Nash authorized biography by Dave Zimmer that Bill Wyman, formerly of the Rolling Stones who plays on the track \\"Love Gangster\\" considered leaving them to join this band, but by then it was done and CSNY were back together. <br />    The tracks in each of the four segments flow into each other without breaks (Grateful Deadheads know what I'm talking about here)which gives the record a live performance feel.  There is a Manassas Musicladen video which includes many of the songs from this record and serves as a nice companion piece.  Devotees of country music or blues or rock and roll and certainly Latin influenced rhythms will all find something to like in this recording and that further illustrates their musical flexibility.  I'm just particularly fond of Stephen Stills as a guitar player whether it's acoustic or electric.  Apart from the late Michael Hedges, few accolades have come his way but that seems to be changing now.
B00015YVDG|1.0|How can this be a special edition when they didn't bother to include the director's cut of the film?  They released it on the Ransom laserdisc years ago with an extra 18 minutes added back into the film.  With so many studios re-releasing movies left and right these days, maybe we'll see a another special edition of Ransom come out in the future...this time done right.  With any luck it will include the director's cut that so many fans of the film want on DVD.
B000BT97AO|4.0|I knew nothing about this movie when I purchased it, except that Neil Gaiman and the Jim Henson Company were involved.  I have always had fond feelings toward the Jim Henson Company because I thought \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Dark Crystal\\" were excellent movies.  I thought that this movie would be similar to those movies; this movie is completely different.<br /><br />Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) is the daughter of circus parents.  As with many teenage girls, Helena is less than thrilled with her life.  Helena's mother collapses shortly after Helena has harsh words with her.  Helena soon discovers that her mother is in very serious condition, and feels guilty because of the words she had.  After the opening scenes that extend on too long, Helena finds herself in an alternate world.<br /><br />Similar to the \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" several of the principal characters are duplicated in the fantasy world into which Helena has journeyed.  Helena discovers that this fantasy world is in some kind of turmoil as the balance between dark and light has shifted.  This world may soon destroy itself unless the balance is set right.<br /><br />Helena discovers that she is partially to blame for the imbalance in the fantasy world.  Her double, anti-Helena, has taken her place in the world she knows, and anti-Helena's departure from the fantasy world is causing the imbalance.<br /><br />Helena learns that the fantasy world and the real world are quite close to each other, but travel between the worlds is only possible with the mirrormask.  Furthermore, the travel must take place through a window that Helena has drawn, and anti-Helena is busy destroying Helena's drawings, as anti-Helena knows that Helena needs a window from one of those drawings to return.<br /><br />As Helena travels through the surreal landscapes of the fantasy world seeking the mirrormask we see many fantastic visions and meet many fascinating creatures.  There were times when I thought I was in a Tool video.  Other times there were reminiscences of \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Dark Crystal.\\"  Mixed into this imagery is Helena's concern that her mother might be dying.<br /><br />I was mixed regarding this movie.  I thought the beginning up to Helena's travel into the fantasy world went on too long, and I chafed waiting for something to happen.  Once Helena went into the fantasy world, events still moved too slowly, though the imagery alternated between good to fantastic.  I am reluctant to recommend this movie to children.  Teenagers perhaps, but not most teenage boys.  I think the lack of action will turn some boys off.<br /><br />On the other hand, fans of surreal animation and modern fantasy may well like this movie.  If you liked Tool's music videos you may also like this movie.  The images were often bizarre and typically unique.<br /><br />It may be some time before I watch this movie again because I am still unsure of whether I like it.  However, I will watch it again to give this fascinating and unique movie another chance to impress itself on my brain.

0195067142|4.0|Sledge's writing is without guile or artistic embellishment. He tells his view of the battles simply and clearly and he reveals all the horror, brutality and waste of war.  For those unfamiliar with how vicious the fighting was in the Pacific, this is a great primer. Many know of the bloody fight for  Okinawa and there is much personal detail here on that battle. Few know of Peleliu because it turned out to be of little strategic value.  Even so, one month of fighting cost the Marines & Army nearly 10,000 casualties. The battle was important to the Marines in that they learned to adapt to the new, more lethal tactics the Japanese tried there.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novel or a historical text, this is not the book for you.  If you want to become more intimately familiar with the nature of the fighting in the Pacific, you will not find a better book.

However, I'm hard of hearing so need subtitles & spent an hour trying to access them.  The only subtitles available are Spanish.  Bottomline:  THEir MONEY WAS WASTED!!!!!!  They no longer have the sales slip & the store they bought it in won't exchange without a sales slip.  Color me disappointed and angry.
0446677450|4.0|This is a Great Book. I believe the main focus of the author is to try and get you, the reader, to change your focus and mindset and to look at life and money from a different point of view. I believe he does a great job at doing that.     Most people seem to be stuck in their own mindset and do not want to change what they are doing because it will make them uncomfortable. That is one of the reasons I believe for the critisims of this book and the author. Most of the critisim that I read the critique was taken out of context about something the author didn't say. I believe that this critique was made by someone who didn't read the book or just thought he could make himself look better by twisting what was actually written. Is the glass half empty or is it half full? The way you look at it determines your mindset. Also one of the critiques says he would like to be a millionaire but is not. Kiyosaki is so whose advice do want to take?    Anyhow this book is taught with one of the oldest and best forms of teaching which is by story telling. People always enjoy a good story and it can be one of the most instructive ways of learning that there are. Maybe that is why to book is so popular by an author who does not claim to be a good writer. Just so you are aware the majority of this book is focused on Real Estate investing and rental property in particular.     I think MOST people will get something out of this book. It will definitely get you to think differently and hopefully get you to make a path like the author has done towards great success.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is disconcerting because it approaches within a hair's breadth the classic heights of movies like \\"Rushmore\\" and \\"Harold and Maude\\" but falls short because it ends too soon.  There is never any final resolution, epiphany, or turning point.  It ends just as you've decided that you love the characters and really care about what happens to them. When the movie ends you find yourself asking: what happens next?  Who wins?  And about a dozen other questions that beg to be answered. <br /> <br />The characters are indeed novel and hilarious.  The dead-pan humor is almost painful to watch it is so funny.  The performances are great by all involved.  My favorite was \\"Kip\\"--Napolean's 32-year-old brother, but I was super intrigued by Kip's beautiful black girlfriend who he met on a web chatroom.  I wanted to learn a whole lot more about her, she is a very intriguing character. She definitely has bad taste in men, because Kip is about the biggest loser to ever walk the planet!  Uncle Rico was a classic with his football fantasies and sales schemes. So was Granny, who we basically only saw two times, the last time flying off her ATV. <br /> <br />Napolean is a fascinating character.  He is different from most nerds: he is comfortable with who he is; one might even say he is brazenly confident.  I like that, he is a truly unique individual.  His little dance in front of classmates took a lot of...confidence, and I think that's why the kids cheered. My favorite scenes, however, were when Napolean is feeding his llama.  That was very amusing. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the plot never quite went full circle.  I was waiting for the climax, which was never forthcoming.  But this movie, when all is said and done, is a must-see.  It is an almost-classic.  It is a bittersweet movie, because it approaches the realm of the great, and just misses it. It reminds you how quirky people can be, and how even odd-balls can be likeable.  And, it shows you that even if you are an oddball, you have nothing to apologize for, because oddballs can be good people and have lots of fun as well.

B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Through John Huston's directorial talents, the colors of Toulouse-Lautrec's palette are duly celebrated as he recreates the night life of fin-de-ciecle Paris.   Our story begins at the famous nightclub in 1890, the year after its opening, where can-can girls and a few professinal male dancers compete for customers' attentions and occassionally brawl with each other.   Serenely sitting at a table sipping cognac and sketching the scene is Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the physically deformed son of a noble family, whose condition causes him to empathize with societal outcastes,played with all the elegance of the nobility  by Jose Ferrer, who, in a dual role, also portrays the artist's father.   Before the last can-can of the evening, the raucous behavior of those on the dance floor is broken up by the appearance of Jane Avril(the always-exquisite Zsa-Zsa Gabor), who sings a ballad that sounds as hopeful as it is melancholy. Muriel Smith, who plays the exotic Aicha, provided Gabor's singing voice.One inaccuracy of the film is that Avril was the only dancer of the Moulin Rouge allowed to wear colored underwear.     As the artist walks home down the dark, foreboding streets, fending off a potential pickpocket, and passing by one lady of the night beforehand, the audience reviews his early life; once expected to carry the traditions of his ancient family into the future, fate dealt him a cruel blow when an accident( in reality, two accidents within two years) revealed a genetic condition that stunted the growth of his legs. Rejection by the girl he loved drove him to make his life elsewhere.   He saves prostitute Marie Charlet(Colette Marchand) from arrest, and shelters her, but suffers because of her ingratitude, then becomes even more unhappy when he tries to part with her. Depressed, he drinks even more heavily to the point where  even his mother, Adele(Claude Nollier)encourages a reconciliation in the hope that he will not drink himself to death. But the reunion is notsucessful. In the grand tradition of artists, Toulouse-Lautrec puts all his emotion into his work, which immortalizes such Moulin Rouge regulars as the wiry, hook-nosed Valentin Le Desosse(Walter Crisham), and Louise Weber, a.k.a., \\"La Goulue\\"(Katherine Kath).   One interesting character who is absent from the story is the red-scarved insult comic, Aristide Bruant, who insulted everyone who came to the Moulin Rouge except for Henri.   Gradually, we watch Toulouse-Lautrec make innovations in art as a draftsman, and gain stature in his profession,and the character of the Moulin Rouge change from a bawdy dance hall to a more sophisticated societal club. The flighty, fliratious Jane continues to have affairs, La Goulue becomes more superficially pompous and difficult, and the King of Prussia (Theodore Bikel)purchases one of Henri's paintings. The pauses in which the artist's sketches dance across the screen are truly a feast   for the eye.    As Henri takes up with a society woman named Myriamme Hayam  (Suzanne Flon), the couple observe Jane's rise in status as a stage performer, and they manage to rescue La Goulue from oblivion.   Elegant surroundings do not alter Henri's view of love or his cynical, self-deprecating humor.   After his affair with Myriamme ends, his drinking increases, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant(Lee Montague), and his housekeeper, Madame Louet(Mary Clare) stand helplessly by. But the film politely deals only with part of what leads to his demise and does not mention syphilis, as it would if it were made today.   A tragic fall down a flight of stairs leads to the 36-year-old's return home to his family chateau to die. His mother expresses  her grief, and there is a fictionalized expression of remorse from his father.... But in the mind's eye of the dying artist, the characters he knew at the outset return to bid him farewell, led by the non-speaking Black male dancer, then Le Desosse on the arm of La Goulue, who stopped fighting with Aicha....Then out of the mists of time, memory, and imagination, his beloved Jane, who bids him adieu and then must be off...Soon, Henri leaves us too, amid the viewing of one last fiery can-can by dancers waving handkerchiefs...Would that the ends of all of our lives could be that whimsical!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|One thing is certain...anything that humanity knows is important, and must be changed for the better will be made into a movie. Hollywood give us directors, and writers who act through their soul, and deliver this soul to the audience. It is no wonder that movies like Brokeback Mountain will be nominated for Oscar and be given award. This movie is certainly a relieve from all the lack-of-content movies we always see (movies like The Transporter or Wedding Crasher). Unlike movies such as the Hotel Rwanda or Passion of the Christ, this movie does NOT rely on religious and propaganda brainwash. It is based purely on the soul, and skills of the producers, making this movie a route to humanity's best.

B000EMGAOY|3.0|There is a thin line between madness and genius.  While they walked this line (or were close enough in years to channel it) RHCP produced songs of genius.  Reading Anthony Kiedis' bio Scar Tissue shows how the madness of sex, drugs and rock and roll led to such masterpieces as Under the Bridge (note how its chorus echoes the Stones' Can't always Get What You Want).   <br /> <br />Now, also echoing the Stones, RHCP has produced its Exile on Main Street - to some it's greatest, to others OK, - a great band as a bar band.  To me, it is extremely hard to imagine anyone playing any of these tunes 100 years after they were written, as will be the case of great rock songs.   <br /> <br />I think RCHP are nice middle aged men who happen to be rock stars.  That's what this music sounds like.  They no longer walk that line between madness and genius.  They are Exiles on Sane Street.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Seeing this show in 1994 at the Louisiana Super Dome was the closest thing to a religious experience I've ever had.  I bought the CD and VHS the day they came out and have waited years for the DVD to arrive.  I was beginning to think it would never happen.  If you've seen the tape, you'll get the DVD.  If you haven't seen it, you need to buy it.  If you have hang ups about Roger Waters not being in the band, grow up.  This concert is the best sounding live concert recording you will ever hear, with songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" extended in such a way that they sound like it was the way they should have been recorded in the first place.  You will not be disappointed!
B00005JOQS|5.0|First off, if you have not seen the original movies make sure to watch at least Superman and Superman 2 if at all possible before watching this movie. The story draws heavily from some pinnacle events that occured in these 2 movies. If you have never seen these 2 movies the first hour or so of this movie might leave you scratching your head about what is going on.<br /><br />So first of all I want to say Bryan Singer is THE MAN! He has a passion for what he does and it really shows in his work. He has gone to great lengths to create a stellar movie and yet remain loyal to the fan base of the previous movies and the TV series that my mom watched when she was a kid.<br /><br />I think Brandon and Kate do a marvelous job, but they are not Christopher and Margot. It was hard for me to set that aside and try to watch the movie without bias at first. My only gripe about Brandon is his Clark Kent is really weak. Christopher Reeve had this part DOWN. He hunched as Clark and stammered and tripped and was basically the polar opposite of Superman. Brandon's Clark was just a little too confident I thought. He seemed like Superman in a suit with glasses.... Trying to play Lois Lane in this movie would be difficult to accomplish. There would be a lot of emotion and inner conflict involved. I don't think Kate pulled this off well enough, but for a first attempt I will cut everyone some slack.<br /><br />I was VERY skeptical about this movie and I had not planned to watch it at first because of the love I held for the originals and especially Christopher Reeve. I'm glad I decided to give it a try. I was hooked from the opening credits!<br /><br />I give this 4 1/2 stars, but it looks like I'll have to round up! Good job and here's hopeing they do some sequels!!
0062513346|1.0|The problem begins with the categorization of this book.  The back cover says that the book is fiction, yet the author repeatedly states that this is a true story in the prologue, epilogue, and everywhere in between.  After this, the problems of the international bestselling author become even more dramatic.<br /><br />Setting himself as the main character, Coelho sets on a journey to find his angel.  Making contact with an angel in itself is not a radical concept for a plot.  However, equating Christianity to sorcery is downright blasphemous.  The elaborate ceremonies described for summoning angels are in no way related to Christian doctrine.  To contact his angel, Coelho seeks a motorcycle gang in the Mojave Desert called the Valkyries.  It is possible that a motorcycle gang could be spiritually gifted.  However, the idea that the Valkyries sleep with men to make money for their missionary work is appalling.<br /><br />Coelho lost my respect in this book the minute he suggested \\"the beast\\" was present on the cover of The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonley Hearts Club Band\\".  How much more hokey and unoriginal could an author be in stealing an idea.  While I enjoyed \\"The Alchemist\\", I felt betrayed after reading this book.  A once promising author has lost his direction and now pedals weird concepts that resemble cults.

B000EOTAM6|1.0|First off, no comparisons between the film and the MTV cartoon.  They're related, inexorably; you draw your own, deeply personal parallels and comparisons.  Me, I think it's irrelevant.<br /><br />Second, I liked the supporting character casting.  How great to see Frances McDormand outside of a Coen Brothers movie, with that wicked red hair--very cool.  Really enjoyed seeing Pete Postlethwaite in this, despite the old-guy make-up and prosthetics.  It's always so great to hear his voice, and look into those deep, sincere eyes, set inside that contradictory mug.  And Johhny Lee Miller.  It took me the ending credits to finally tag him as \\"Trainspotting's\\" Sick Boy, and I enjoyed him in this work.<br /><br />And that's the extent of my enjoyment.  My only comment upon this film's conclusion was that I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.<br /><br />The Theron costuming was ridiculous, strikingly unsexy and contradictory to the story.  She's attacking one of the most closely guarded facilities in the city, at night, and she's wearing an all-white bodysuit.  The hair is distracting, looking like a despondent Alfalfa most of the time.<br /><br />Overall, the F/X weren't inspiring or impressive, not at all.  I mean, seriously, the jungle landscape at the end looks like that super-cheezy Montezuma pyramid backdrop painting at the end of \\"From Dusk 'Til Dawn.\\"  The chicky fights look exactly like what they are: gymnastics-on-wire, all spinning and floating.<br /><br />She's the best agent ever, yet she's constantly in need of everyone's help to get her out of jams and to help her complete her mission.  Everyone fears her, but it seems she can't get anything done.<br /><br />She's the greatest agent ever, yet her baby sister knows all about her activities as a rebel.  How's that for solid operational security?<br /><br />The Council has surveillance everywhere--everywhere!--and yet Aeon and her partner infiltrate the inner sanctum without any real problem, just more sexy wire-gymnastics.  And not one alarm goes off; no guards are alerted.  Seems they don't even have cameras to monitor these incredibly sensitive areas.<br /><br />At the end, Aeon, Trevor, and evil brother Oren all get shot, but the dozens and dozens and dozens of evil guards/troopers never land a shot on any one of them. All three main characters go down, heavily wounded, until the script tells them to get up, run, and do something conclusive. The evil guards manage to kill all three Monican snipers, hundreds of feet away, but when it comes time to shoot down either Trevor or Aeon, they're predictably incapable; it's just sad, stock, laughable Hollywood pan-n-slow-mo of Aeon in her cool outfit with the casings spinning, mowing them down as they stand pretty for her.<br /><br />And Aeon destroys the Relicle.  How is it that in 400+ years, no one, no rebel had ever boarded it before?  Seemed to be relatively easy, again with no security, no monitoring whatsoever.  How is it they'd never shot it down, since weapons and training don't seem to be a problem for the rebels?  How is it no one else knows what its functions are?  What absolutely stark raving idiot of a government chief executive chose to store the collected DNA repository of all living human beings in a Goodyear blimp with gold taffeta trendrils flying in circles over the city?  How is this a common-sensical security decision? I think an underground vault would be a smarter move.<br /><br />And Aeon somehow has freed everyone because she's killed the DNA library and now everyone has to really die?  Like just destroying the Relicle puts it all to rest?  Hello, the DNA is standing around you in the city streets gawking at the spectacle, and the scientific knowledge to continue the cloning program is common.  Yes, there's that long sought after regime change, but the only change in the dynamic is enlightened leadership allowing natural procreation, the path out of the dark and into a new dawn for humanity.<br/><br />And the big wall gets all smashed down and there's that wild jungle outside.  Gosh, I didn't get that symbolism at all.  Say, why don't you just glue that symbol to a two-by-four and hit me over the head with it, so I'll really REALLY get the point.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is not the cartoon--which was better in every way--and one shouldn't expect it to be.  If you're looking for mindless violence, then you've got it, but there is a lot better and more original out there than this.  If you want hard, reasonably logical sci-fi, this isn't it. If you're looking for ultra-sexy, then this won't scratch that itch either.  But if you're a fanatically loyal Charlize fan, then this is just for you.  And that's about it.wn for humanity. <br /> <br />And the big wall gets all smashed down and there's that wild jungle outside.  Gosh, I didn't get that symbolism at all.

B00005JNS0|5.0|I took my grandchildren to see cars and I enjoyed it as much as they did.  I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can buy it and watch it over and over.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This movie caught my eye at the video store one day. I hadn't heard anything about it, but it sounded interesting enough to rent.  After I watched this, I took it to my sister the next day so she could see it, and then I ordered a copy to buy before I returned the rental!  It is hilarious, poignant and thought-provoking. All about family, ancestral connections, atonement.  The Ukranian tour guide, who butchers the English language shamelessly, is a wonderful character.

B000E41MS6|5.0|The first series of the new Doctor Who arrives on DVD in the U.S. with plenty of bells and whistles. We get the 13 episodes from the first series in an excellent transfer along with a commentary track on every single episode of the show. Christopher Eccelston is excellent as the Doctor in a series of witty, fun adventures. Writer Russell T. Davies (\\"Queer as Folk\\", \\"Touching Evil\\") has recreated the Doctor by capturing the best elements of previous incarnations and putting his own spin on the material.<br /><br />Surprisingly the best episodes in this set are not written by Davies. He's done a great job of reimagining the Doctor for the 21st century (and Eccelston does a great job of embodying him taking elements from before Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton, etc. and then molding them into his own portrayal)but the best episodes here are the two part \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\". It captures the humanity, the mystery and complexity of what made the show at its best one of the finest shows on TV.<br /><br />The first episode of the series takes off at a breakneck pace as we meet Rose (Billie Piper) a department store worker who discovers an invasion by the department store dummies (possibly the Autons although they are never called that in the episode). The sixth episode involves the return of the Daleks. Actually it's a single Dalek as the Doctor mentions during the show that all of the Time Lords and the Daleks were destroyed with the Doctor believing he's the only survivor of their conflict. Needless to say this isn't a happy reunion between these two lone survivors bound by hatred and fear of each other. This single survivor has fallen into the hands of a greedy American  who collects alien technology in order to backwards engineer it and sell it.  There are plenty more besides that terrific episode.. The two part \\"The Empty Child\\"/\\"The Doctor Dances\\" also stands up well with a moving an powerful story. We also meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) another time traveler who shows up mysteriously during World War II in London.<br /><br />The transfer looks very good. For those that are super critical about such things the color is quite good and if you're a videophile you'll probably note that the resolution in some of the darker scenes isn't quite as good as it could be but the overall look of the show is quite pleasing. The audio 5.1 mix is a bit bizarre with the rear speaker mixes louded than the center (since this IS dialogue driven it would sense for the opposite to be the case) but that's pretty easily adjusted on your system. Why the BBC didn't correct this problem with the master (or Warner for that matter) is beyond me. It is a problem that supposedly existed in the first batch of releases in the UK and Canada so it's clear the same master was used here. Packaged in a fold out case with the discs laid on top of each other (the disc with the concurrent documentaries about the making of the show is strangely enough the first one you'll encounter when you open it)the packaging features the T.A.R.D.I.S. with the Doctor and Rose on a plastic holder that slips around the packaging to hold it all together.<br /><br />The first disc has an interview with Christopher Eccleston from BBC Breakfast where he discusses his memories of watching Doctor Who (not very many)and what attracted him to the project (writer Russel T. Davies). I do take exception to Eccleston describing \\"Doctor Who\\" as a show for children. Children can appreciate it (my kids love it) because of the humor and humanity but the show isn't just for children because it's a science fiction--it's for everyone capturing the best elements of drama. It's not \\"The Tempest\\" or \\"The Godfather\\" but it was never meant to be. Like \\"Star Trek\\" or \\"Farscape\\" at its best its about the quality of the drama. I think what Eccleston probably meant was that its a show that children can watch with high dramatic values. At least I hope so.<br /><br />\\"Making Doctor Who With Russell T. Davies\\" features the writer in a video diary providing us behind-the-scenes footage from before the first read through of the show through to production. \\"Waking the Dead\\" also provides us with a video diary on the making of this episode (which features a terrific performance by Simon Callow). \\"Laying Ghost: The Origin of the Unquiet Dead\\" is also on the first disc along with trailers for the show and a storyboard of the trailers accompanied by the theme. We get a lot additional extras scattered throughout the set. Each disc has some extras on them related to the episodes on that disc for the most part.<br /><br />The overall quality of this set is quite good. I'm looking forward to the second season of the series and hope that Sci-Fi won't delay its arrival on DVD like they did this set.e writer in a video diary providing us behind-the-scenes footage from before the first read through of the show through to production. \\"Waking the Dead\\" also provides us with a video diary on the making of this episode (which features a terrific performance by Simon Callow). \\"Laying Ghost: The Origin of the Unquiet Dead\\" is also on the first disc along with trailers for the show and a storyboard of the trailers accompanied by the theme.

B000E5N62U|4.0|If you like Steely Dan, especially their more recent jazz influenced style, you'll like this latest CD from Donald Fagen.  At first listen it sounds like more of the same, which it is, but the tunes grow on you with repeated listening.  If you're a connoisseur of fine music and arrangements you'll appreciate the skill and refinement used to make this collection of excellent tunes.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I indeed was mesmerized throughout this film, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant.<br /><br />Never knew Truman Capote, or read any of his works, never was interested. Thought this was going to be boring, documentary-ish, not at all. As I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, and look forward to anything with him in it, we got the DVD and watched last night.<br /><br />My darling Norman fell asleep, and toddled off to bed halfway through, but not me! I stayed up till the wee hours to finish it. It held my interest, keep me captivated, and was fascinating to me.<br /><br />I'm assuming it is somewhat accurate, even though Mr. Capote is gone, the writers no doubt interviewed friends and family. The woman that played his assistant, was very very good. Charming and believable. I found it equally fascinating that she wrote the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" Must look her up.<br /><br />His humor, his mannerisms, his lies to get the story - all fascinated me. I loved how his assistant had him so pegged. That alone was very funny. She called him on his lies and selfish ambitions many times, in a way that never angered him. Loved that. What decorum she had!<br /><br />Educational, interesting.. for me - my hubby didn't appreciate it - but... oh well!
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you love BTVS as much as I do and can't get enough of their musical episode by the same title then is this CD for you! <br />Featuring songs from the episode, in the origonal recordings of the cast, and some scores from the show. <br />This is a wonderful CD for Buffy fans, I highly recomend it!
B000002TQV|5.0|Some music lifts itself above the fray, yielding far more than the average recording.  The ingredients of such creations vary and are difficult to quantify or to describe.  People get degrees in humanities and write theses about these records.  The Bends is in that category with not many others.  It is certainly separate from any other popular issue of its era, and is one of the inestimable Radiohead's best, rawest, yet most easily palatable CDs.
1594200823|5.0|Humane, well-researched, and an engrossing, entertaining read, this book's point-of-view and info belongs in the mind of everyone who cares deeply enough about food to allow knowledge about its production to change habits of consumption.  <br />
B000B8QF14|1.0|I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think green day is a wannabe. I think he needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to paint glasses green and view the day green. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough

1878424750|5.0|One of the best works of Deepak to date.  Short!! Concise!! Powerful!!
B000002KDG|5.0|This is a lovely Neil album... I wouldn't call it his best, as some of the punk experimentation at the end (\\"Welfare Mothers\\" in particular) seems very un-Neil -- though then again, maybe exactly Neil for an artist who has made an identity by changing.  Indeed, when you look at this album, one finds Neil using his typical / acoustic electric formats... but somehow both forms seem to be digging a little deeper, challenging new ground, more than before.  It is an album of experimentation... <br /> <br />Starting with \\"Hey Hey, My My\\" -- a very un-mellow acoustic song that bites almost as hard as electric, especially lyrically, where Neil Young passes the torch of \\"rock\\" to punk, instead of lamenting that the kids are killing \\"rock.\\" It seems, in fact, that the rest of the album fits right under this umbrella: \\"More to the picture than meets the eye.\\"   <br /> <br />One sees how \\"My My, Hey Hey\\" was an encouraging song to these kids with the ridiculous level of feedback.  Here one finds a \\"classic\\" artist -- a dinosaur to some -- almost imitating the punk generation; while drawing an essential thread of music and rebellion, from Elvis to Johnny Rotten, that the spirit could not be monopolized by a given generation. <br /> <br />There are three great songs, here. \\"Powderfinger\\" is one.  It is impossible to tell what this song is about but it is one of Neil's most vivid story songs, just the same.  I always pictured it as a raid on an Indian village bitten by tragedy and cultural pressures.  It has such an energizing melody for a sad song... because it isn't a sad song, it's a song of bravery and sacrifice, even if not of success: \\"Just think of me as one you never figured.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Pocahontas,\\" again under a driving melody, conjures up images of  the Indian wars of the West and follows that theme into our own cultural waste dump... hard to explain, again, but an image song that certainly reverberates of tragedy... and surival in a roundtable of Pocahontas, MarlonBrando (who had an Indian wife for a while, why he is in the song I am sure) and Neil Young. <br /> <br />And finally, one of the five best Neil songs is \\"Thrasher\\": a metaphor for the breakup of CSNY it seems, where CSN opts for \\"hotels with air conditioned bars\\" while Neil wanders the open desolate roads, unafraid of death and being forgotten... Neil again tapping nature to describe his own identity, and more beautifully than ever before or since. \\"But I'll know the time has come to give what's mine.\\" <br /> <br />All told, Rust Never Sleeps is an explosive, creative, wonderful album from an aging rocker; some might argue Neil's last great album before the dark age -- but maybe when Neil says \\"it's better to burn out than to fade away\\" he isn't talking about death, but about living.  As the image in \\"Thrasher,\\" giving what is yours regardless of age or rust or any of it........ Neil made it clear that he was not going to stop creating and become a complacent has-been playing greatest hits: he was going to keep doing whatever the heck he wanted, which is really what the spirit is, isn't it?
B000ASATZ8|4.0|The first was good But the others were not I could watch tremors over and over But the other were ok but not as good.
B000002I69|5.0|Koto song is one of the most haunting piece of music I have ever heard. It is ipnotic in its eternal beauty. It is unforgettable. If it was for this tune alone, this album is absolutly one to have. Absolutly and I mean it. But Koto song is not the only highlight of this concert. Rotterdam blues is a wonderful blues. And what about the two extraordinary long versions of Truth and Take five? Gerry Mulligan really shines here. His interplay with Desmond and Brubeck is something of the highest grade. In Take five the band take a long ride on the various modal scales, major and minor in 5/4 time. Really ipnotic this one too. It is a wonderful take five version and I really love the crescendo Dave take at the end of his solo, from 8.05. It perfectly guide you to the drum solo. Really Great!! This album is cool, it swings, it haunts you. I own this since I was a student. The father of  a girlfriend of mine had this nice collection of old Jazz records and he was really into Desmond and Mulligan. I put this one and Two of a kind on a tape (it was tape time!) and I did wear out the thing. Those were among the first jazz albums I have ever had. Now I own 7000 but I still listen to these two albums quite regularly (but I still prefer this concert to the studio album from Desmond and Mulligan in their pianoless encounter \\"TOAK\\"). I think this album should be the second from Dave one should own, just after Time out of course. But here you have Gerry Mulligan as a nice addiction. Absolutly suggested.
0345472640|5.0|This is a prizewinning after-action-report and a fine account of our soldiers in action.  I fought during Tet, and I know how brutal it was.  This book made me tremble, but I feel great pride.  All should read.
0446577383|3.0|The Camel Club is a Baldacci thriller that does not stand up to his other writings. Though an enjoyable read, I cold not read in this in one evening as I usually do with his books. I did not find this a fast read. And it may be because the author tries to fit all the agencies and use current events as a background into one book. And a very unbelievable ending. This is a book you should just borrow from the library. Reading a bad book by David Baldacci is better then most books written in this genre.    The characters are not well developed. The Camel club consists of four eccentric, yet intelligent, conspiracy theorists. One of who lives in a tent across the street from the White House. A sign hangs on his tent, \\"I want the Truth.\\" And as can be expected, they are the eyes in which this story unfolds. With all that said, these four characters would be interesting to watch in a movie.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Not knowing alot about the Medieval Crusades in the middle-east this movie sparked and interests to learn more about the time. As a movie this one has it all, love, hate, religion, action, sex, intrigue. Having watched the theatrical release of this movie, I was somewhat let down by the poor transtition from scene to scene. Now that I have seen this one, the story is MUCH better. Complete. This is the version that should have been released in theaters, but for whatever reason was watered down. Ridley Scott is and excellent storyteller. Hopefully we'll see more of this kind of movie in the future.
0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead can hardly be considered a sequel to Ender's Game. A formulaic sequel to the trials of Ender Wiggin, sci-fi's most famous reluctant military genius, would be an even greater threat to humanity calling upon the only person in the universe with the deadly cunning to stop it, and perhaps with a sexy love interest thrown in to please the marketers. <br /> <br />But formulaic this novel ain't. As is explained by the author himself, Ender's Game is more appropriately described as a prologue to Speaker for the Dead, the story Orson Scott Card wanted to tell of Ender from the beginning. <br /> <br />Speaker for the Dead is set far in the future from Ender's Game and tells a vastly different story. Ender is his own man now, anonymous and uncontrolled by violent forces. In Speaker for the Dead you see the result of Ender's internal childhood struggle in the person that he has become - quiet and compassionate, with great talents for things other than slaughter. <br /> <br />But Ender will nevertheless find himself in the center of turmoil, with destructive forces bearing down on him as he attempts to save a human colony and a newly discovered alien race from annihilation. <br /> <br />All the excitement, suspense, and depth of Ender's Game is delivered in Speaker for the Dead and more. This is Card's greatest story, and one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.
0739318101|5.0|This is my first Sophie Kinsella book (listening to, or reading), and we absolutely loved it, loved it, loved it!  (My boyfriend and I listened to it in the car.)  With her English accent, listening to Emily Gray read it really makes it even more enjoyable.  She does a great job.   <br /> <br />As for the book itself...It's nice and light, and hilarious.  You can't wait to hear what's going to come out of Emma's mouth next, or see what's going to happen to her.  Her relationship with Lissie is so sweet.  Every girl would like to have a friendship like theirs.   <br /> <br />I think this book would make a great movie. A reviewer of the unabridged audio version said they read somewhere that it is being made into a movie, with Kate Hudson playing Emma.  I can't picture Kate as Emma, but imagine it will stil be good. <br /> <br />I'm definitely going to add Sophie Kinsella to my list of good authors.
0670813028|5.0|I know fans of the Dark Tower and the Stand may balk and quibble, but this story is the best thing Stephen king has ever put on paper.  If you want to dedicate yourselves to 7 books, then please, please, please read the Dark Tower books. If you have the time, the Stand will blow your mind as well.  But I digress, it is It I am talking about here.  The other reviews do a good job of giving a synopsis of the what happens in the story, so I will not speak of that here.  I want to tell you that I have read most of King's novels, a lot of Lovecraft and Poe's major works, but this is the only book that had me scared to death during the middle of a beautiful summer day.  I was literally afraid to put my foot on the ground from the couch, lest a hand reach out and grab my ankle.  I've often heard people say \\"Stephen King is a good story teller, but not a good writer.\\"  This book puts that B.S. to bed forever.  How can one be a good story teller without being able to communicate effectively the elements necessary to tell a great story (in this example, with words)? The link the reader develops to the characters is so strong that I almost had to put the book down before the ending, afraid I would lose friends by finishing the story.  King accomplishes this feat of \\"storytelling\\" with the same virtuoso \\"writing\\" as Faulkner does with Joe Christmas or Caddie and Steinbeck does with Tom Joad and Doc.  I know for a fact that I will read It again before I die, and I can't say that very often.  I'm no critic, I don't have time to waste on that often disparaging trade, but I couldn't keep quiet about this book. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FILW86|5.0|You have got to be kidding me.  Back in the summer of '79 we (younger than 13) were all discovering this \\"weird\\" new band from Rockford Illinois.  Later, we soon learned they were the best in that wonderful town next to baseball, hotdogs, and Amber Lynn. Now, they have decided to blow everyone away again with their best recording in 10 years.   <br /> <br />If you like real rock and roll with an innovative, well thought out pop sensibility, then look no further.  Very few acts keep in touch with what made them HUGE in the first place.  The Tricksters give us another reason to adore them and well crafted American POP! <br /> <br />Great album!
B00069YDXU|5.0|I can't understand the bad reviews that a couple of people have left for this great dvd. I have followed this band 'from the beginning', saw them live in the 70's and have viewed all of their video material. This is simply the best. There are a few minor flaws as with any live performance but they don't hurt a thing. Listen to the original Tarkus on cd, then listen and watch Tarkus on this and you will see what I mean. Emerson is the greatest keyboardist of all times, Palmer is the greatest percussionist of all times and Lake is in no way short on talent. Their skills have not eroded in any way. If anything they are better. Lakes voice is a little deeper but still has the unique sound that makes this band complete. We can only hope that they will perform together again. If not we have this dvd of which I own two of. I sometimes have to loan one out to friends and can't stand to be without one. Sometimes the camera work is off, they need to focus more on Keith when he's the highlite. The sound is fine, I had to work with my home system to find the best sound---don't you always. Another good comparison, listen to Fanfare, Rondo, etc. on cd and then listen and watch the encore medly which totally kicks arse to the original versions.
B00005JOQS|2.0|Long on schmaltz and cliches, Superman Returns slogs on and on, at times seemingly trapped in virtual slow motion -- arcing this way and that, through plot holes and wooden acting.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Superman. I'll admit that. And I've never been much of a fan of Bryan Singer. I think he's a middling director, and a second-rate storyteller. Superman Returns did nothing to disabuse me of either notion. But I really wanted to like this movie. The trailers were intriguing. Stopping a bullet with your eye? How cool is that?  It suggested a spark of originality, of pushing the envelope. But when the movie starts sluggishly and gives us our first glimpse of the young Superman running and leaping a la the first Spiderman movie--so patent was the rip-off, it made me shake my head in disbelief--it becomes apparent that there's little hope.<br /><br />Brandon Routh brings a naive charm to the role of Superman. No great shakes, but he's the best of the bunch. Kevin Spacey? Wasted -- plus he doesn't bring the sick fun to the role that I expected. Granted, with those ridiculous lines, he started at a great disadvantage. Kate Bosworth is pretty enough, but most of her tears -- and there are too many -- seem eyedropped in.  James Marsden? Eh. Parker Posey? A low-rent Valerie Perrine. The kid? He looks like a young, anemic McCauley Culkin, and that about sums up his performance.<br /><br />And as this Mulligan Stew of a movie plods on and on, this way and that, we do get some impressive special effects. The flying is very realistic and thrilling. But for every impressive effect, there are bad ones, too.  In a number of scenes, Superman looks fake -- the helicopters look fake -- the buildings look fake. If this is what you get for effects in a $225 million film, someone ought to sue the special effects company for overbilling.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning, too, the overbearing analogies to the story of Jesus. Yeah, yeah. We know Jor-El sent his only begotten son, blah, blah, blah, but the scene in the hospital, when we see the bed empty ... too much.<br /><br />Watch box office plummet as word of this weary -- and stupefying  -- movie spreads.<br /><br />The trailer for Spider-man 3 was the best part of this film. Here's waiting for next May and an exciting super-hero film.begotten son, blah, blah, blah, but the scene in the hospital, when we see the bed empty ... too much. <br /> <br />Watch box office plummet as word of this weary -- and stupefying  -- movie spreads. <br /> <br />The trailer for Spider-man 3 was the best part of this film.

B000EHSVS2|5.0|Join George C. Scott, Karl Malden and a host of others in a high-powered assault of German forces across several countries...  The masterminds behind this script (Francis Ford Coppola) and subsequent movie got it right.  Garnering a host of awards including seven Oscars, including one for best actor (Scott) and best picture, this movie is a detailed depiction of the success and ego of one of the finest generals ever produced by the US Military Academy.    As far as this new Special Edition is concerned, the video transfer wasn't the absolute best, but it certainly wasn't bad.  The audio is pretty awesome in surround sound.  Curiously, the \\".1\\" (subwoofer) is absent, but really not necessary in my opinion.  At high volume during the war scenes, there is plenty of clarity and the booms are loud but not overbearing.  At the current price of $12.67, I think it's a steal.  George C. Scott does total justice to Patton the man, hands-down the most successful general in WW2.    Sometimes I put the movie in just to watch the intro and then fast-forward to the part where Patton first encounters the \\"Desert Fox\\" Erwin Rommel...As Patton's forces are kicking the s*&t out of the Nazis, Patton yells \\"I read your book!!!\\" referring to Rommel's book on tank tactics that the movie shows Patton reading the evening before the engagement (after some investigating, it turns out that no such book was written by Rommel...)    A truly wonderful movie that harkens back to a time when winning a war was truly appreciated.
B000GDH9RI|5.0|I've got to admit that I was a little worried about how this DVD would turn out.  \\"From Wishes to Eternity\\" is my favorite DVD bar none- could it be matched?  Most of the live clips I've seen since FWTE, have been reasonably good, but not spectacular.  Big stages have seemed to diminish band interaction and the immediacy & impact of the performances, the band has looked kind of static and audio quality has been nothing great, at best.  Then there's the whole Tarja situation and its still lingering aftermath.... <br /> <br />Well fellow NW acolytes and all you \\"civilians\\" out there, have no fear because this show and DVD/box is another great Nightwish experience.  High energy all around, the intensity level stays up throughout the entire show, everyone in the arena seems to be fully engaged in the event, the band's performance is great, the audio is the best yet, and the video work is generally solid too.  Realistically, its just about as much as one could hope for as far as capping things off in a positive and energetic way. <br /> <br />So, some details...  Its nice and long....18 songs with a concert length of 100 minutes.  Despite reputedly having the flu that day, both Marco and Tarja sound fantastic - at the top of their form.  Marco adds a lot of onstage chemistry, as you would expect (who was that surly looking guy with a bass on FWTE anyway\\").  Tarja looks fully engaged and she appears to be enjoying herself.  Her whole situation really wasn't much of a factor for me, while watching the show, although it does kind of enter your awareness once the last couple of songs come along.  Forget about picking highlights, there are just too many, but if I must I would take \\"Bless the Child\\", \\"Ghost Love Score\\" - especially when the red confetti falls towards the end, and \\"Over the Hills\\".  Don't agree? Well, I could just as easily pick Marco's brilliant rendition of \\"High Hopes\\", the best performance of \\"Sleeping Sun\\" I've seen, and the dynamic blast of \\"Dark Chest ofWonders\\".  The point is that there is an awful lot to be thrilled with, just as was the case with FWTE. <br /> <br />One thing I really want to make note of is how good the \\"Century Child\\" material sounds.  Even if you were never crazy about songs like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" or \\"Ever Dream\\" chances are you will love them here.  This has a lot do with audio clarity, I think.  The vocals are much more upfront and present than on the \\"Century Child\\" CD and there seems to be less smearing and greater clarity in the overall mix.  Even \\"Bless the Child\\", which was already one of my very favorite Nightwish songs, sounds better here.  It really makes me wish more of \\"Century Child\\" had been included; it would have been pure bliss to have \\"End of All Hope\\" and \\"Beauty of the Beast\\" on there as well.  Although this may sound a bit heretical and strange, I'd have to say it could have been better to replace \\"Kinslayer\\" and \\"Wishmaster\\" with more \\"Century Child\\" tracks.  We already have great performances of those on FWTE and the \\"End of an Era\\" versions don't quite stack up to the FWTE versions. <br /> <br />The DVD would also be an excellent introduction to Nightwish for those unfamiliar with the band, even for non-metal fans.  I've used FWTE for this purpose quite a bit.  Just the other day, six or eight people in my family - none of whom have any particular inclination towards heavy music - became very interested upon accidentally seeing a couple of clips from FWTE.  So now I'm buying that many more copies of FWTE and Wishmaster to get them started.  End of an Era would be just as appealing in that way.  Although at current prices and availability I may have to hide \\"End of an Era\\" and hope a cheaper NTSC version appears someday!  <br /> <br />Now naturally there are things that I think could have been done better or differently.  There is an awful lot of fast cutting, especially in the beginning of the show.  There are a lot of nice camera angles, moving pan/zoom shots andso on, but it seems like there are so many cuts that the pacing is too fast - it can actually feel a little disorienting at first.  It does seem like less of an issue upon repeat viewings, maybe that's the intention.   I thought the added visual effects were unnecessary - they don't mesh as well as with the quasi high-def feel of \\"End of an Era\\" as they did with the video on FWTE .  At times the add-ons were pretty distracting:  superimposed flames during parts of \\"Ghost Love Score\\" - please - isn't it powerful enough already?  Cheesy!  And who are those crying girls anyway?  With 12,000+ people present, let's see more variety in audience shots.  There are other things that could be argued, but really there's nothing seriously amiss here - all of these issues are mainly in the realm of fun fan debate. <br /> <br />Remember that this is strictly PAL video at this point in time; it may not work in your Region 1 DVD player.  Even certain of my players that accept other PAL DVDs won't play this one.  It is fine, though, in any player I tried that specifically accepted PAL and it is fine in any PC or Mac that I tried it on.  Some may notice sync issues with this DVD; it actually looked more noticeable to me than on FWTE.  That's if its really there at all - sometimes I wonder if I'm really seeing it or not.  I have noticed the same phenomenon on the Therion DVD that just came out; it makes wonder if this has to do with PAL to NTSC conversion artifacts or if there's some sort of framing glitch when certain devices play back PAL video. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm really pleased with \\"End of an Era\\" and extremely grateful to Tuomas and all for producing another masterful and memorable Nightwish treasure.  I guess I have two favorite DVDs now; here's hoping the era to come matches up to the past and that I can up that number in a few years time.....
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I absolutely loved the first Underworld. It threw vampires and werewolves together with an actual plot. I loved the history of the movie and its characters.<br /><br />But what about Underworld 2? Its even better!<br /><br />It has more of the first movies intricate plot and deceit and more of everything else... except better. There are more action sequences, more blood, more gore, and more Beckinsale. How can you not enjoy this movie?<br /><br />The 'original' vampire Marcus, the guy with wings, absolutely rocked. I loved his character almost as much as Lucian from the first movie. Plus the scene with Marcus and Craven was worth the two years wait...<br /><br />All in all, i had a tremendous time watching this film. It has everything i enjoy. Beautiful women, vampire and werewolf horror, and plenty of spectacular action sequences. A pure joy to watch.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and a highly motivated group of 20 graduate students deliver one of the best explanations yet for why some companies make the leap from good to great.   The interviews, man hours, and exceptional synthesis in this work are second to none.       Collins introduces the concept of the Level 5 leader - which in his study is the first and most important ingredient for a company to achieve greatness.  Interestingly, these leaders are described as having a high degree of humility - and an inclination for sacrificing their personal needs for what is best for the company.        We also learn about the concept of facing the \\"brutal facts.\\"  In an impressive anecdote, Collins speaks of his interview with Admiral Stockdale - the senior ranking POW in Vietnam.  Stockdale contends that his acceptance of his situation, i.e. \\"facing the brutal facts\\" were pivotal to his survival in captivity.    Collins and his team succeed marvelously in producing a practical guide for both private and public enterprises.  The lessons learned in this work would be valuable to any CEO or business leader, or to those in the nascent stages of developing a business.  A great read and important contribution to business scholarship, Good to Great lives up to its name.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|Being a Kevin Kline fan but NOT a Meg Ryan fan I did not want to see this initially.  My husband talked me into it.  I think it is a pretty run of the mill romantic comedy.  If you like either or both of the actors you will probably like this movie.  In my opinion the best scene is when Kevin Kline's character is teaching Meg Ryan's character about the wine where he comes from.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This Album is really good, i forgot the fact that i didnt think much of Aenima & Lateralus on my first few listens either. If you are a Tool fan of old, open your ears and wait before making an abstract review that you will only regret anyway. Also 10,000 days (wings pt 2) is sheer brilliance! I give this album 4.8 stars when compared to the above mentioned albums. <br />Give it time ok, hell if you put on third eye for a non tool fan they will think your ludicrous but we love it. Dont force it upon you, surrender yourself to it.
B000FGGE68|3.0|While i had a decent time watching this film, it didnt have that special something that kept me glued or made me want to watch it a second time.<br /><br />And while there was some great potential in the story and setting, it seemed like it was a wasted effort.<br /><br />First off, i think the director tried too hard to make the movie 'futuristic.' Every setting and prop looked straight from the Jetsons. Except for those unexplainable guns from our present time. Or those military trucks from 1995 or so.<br /><br />And why did Milla have to change color like a chameleon?<br /><br />There was no explanation or reason behind that. Anyways...<br /><br />Ultraviolet had some decent action scenes, although a bit repetitive, some bad acting, and a plot that took itself way too seriously. Add this all together and you have your average bland popcorn action flick. Ho hum...
B00005JOQS|3.0|When I entered the theater for Superman Returns, this was the fist Superman movie I ever have seen in theaters, I anticipated It would be just like the other movies, comic relief, provided not much by Kevin Spacey, and justice, just like how Christopher Reeve was Superman. How Wrong was I! Clark Kent returns to earth expecting the whole world to love him and praise him, but Earth has moved on.I did not like the end of this film. I think it sets up a bad movie for the sequel. I mean come on Warner Bros. and Bryan Singer! Cut Supes some slack before giving him a son. Let \\"his\\" series develop not his sons. <br /> <br />     Another thing this film lacks is character development, I love Lex Luthor in this, but what this movie needs is an Otis(from the 78 Superman) and idiot that actually makes Luthor seem genius). <br /> <br />       I am just telling you if you go to see this movie don't get your hopes soaring, because I sure didn't think Superman soars in this. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00001NFCY|4.0|It took two years after the release of Creed's debut album, for the rock band to finally hit it big. HUMAN CLAY was marked as the group's breakthrough album and gave the performers their much delayed attention that they had been striving for. The record landed Creed as part of the soundtrack to the film Scream 3, with the track \\"What If\\". Personally, I do not know why this record was so important for Creed's fame, but I believe it has to do with Stapp's lyrics. His words are less political and a lot more spiritual for this album than on the previous one. This of course appealed to an incredibly large base of religous listeners and helped bring Creed into the public spotlight. Mark Tremonti also adds more flare to the band's sound. He produces more melodic guitar lines and performs interesting introductions and solos. However, this record is very repetitive at times, and can even become tiresome to the ear. What makes this album so appealing is its lyrics, dynamics, and overall contour. HUMAN CLAY is unique in its entirity, but not even close to be part of Creed's best work.     Stand out tracks include:   \\"Are You Ready?\\"  \\"What If\\"  \\"Faceless Man\\"  \\"Never Die\\"  \\"Higher\\"  \\"Wash Away Those Years\\"
B000E1ZBH2|2.0|While Kira Knightly exceaded my expectations, the film was, to its core, unfaithful to the victorian society that Jane Auston wrote about and critiqued. Jane Austen, i would argue, did not write romance novels so much as commentaries on the world around her. This film was not at all faithful to that society. A young woman would NEVER go about in the dark in her night gown and coat. She would NEVER kiss a man before they were married. Yes she was an upstart and a spit fire... but these basic diversions from societal norms were not Elizabeths... they were a product of modern romantic folly.
1567184855|5.0|If you're interested in the meaning of life, this book provides incredible insights into our soul's journey.  What I found fascinating were the transcriptions of nearly 40 client regressions.  Newton has pieced together these \\"interviews\\" to create an evidence-based description that was easy to follow and really resonated as true. <br /> <br />The fact of reincarnation has created a shift in how I view my life; things just go a lot more interesting!  There is greater urgency for me to seek my life lessons and to make use of every moment.  I also see the need to accept responsibility for helping others to grow.  I find it reassuring that I have guides and soulmates here on earth to help me on the way.   <br /> <br />This book helped me realize these truths in a more concrete way -- and that's quite an accomplishment for a book.  For people new to this concept of reincarnation, I highly recommend starting with Many Lives, Many Masters.  It's an approachable introduction from a highly respected psychiatrist, Brian Weiss.
B000001FKY|5.0|While not as good as the opus gem Pyromania, Hysteria is a solid follow-up for the 80s stadium band.  Solid Hits are:<br /><br />**** Women<br /><br />**** Rocket<br /><br />**** Animal<br /><br />***** Love Bites<br /><br />**** Pour Some Sugar On Me<br /><br />**** Hysteria<br /><br />Even though Pour Some Sugar On Me remains one of the most overplayed songs I have ever heard in my life (probably 2nd only to Celine Dion 'My Heart Will Go On'), for anyone that enjoys solid rock music and especially tunes from the 80s, you can't go wrong with Hysteria.  There are 2 \\"must buy\\" albums from Def Leppard and this is one of them.  Turn it up and enjoy!!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JOQS|1.0|I wanted so much to enjoy this new version but what happened to \\"Truth, Justice and the American Way?\\"  There is NO American Flag or American Way.  Those of us who were raised in the 50's will understand that Superman was an American hero.  It's not that way any more.  It seems like Warner Brothers went out of the way to make this Superman politically correct.  I can not recommend this film.  Everything that Superman should and did stand for is \\"No More.\\"  I was very very disappointed.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Still good even 15 years after I saw it for the first time. It is something I will be pleased to show my children.
B00006IX0R|2.0|I bought this best-of cd wanting to hear a band I liked and saw a few times back in college. The problem is, Amazon doesn't let you know that the songs are the \\"singles\\" versions that were shortened for radio. \\"Promises\\" is hacked down to practically nothing. I'd recommend just buying their original cd's as opposed to this.
0803726570|4.0|I have kids ages six and seven.  I started reading this book to them when they were about four and they have loved it since then.  Even though they have had it for a few years, they still take it out to read, that's a good sign!
B00000260F|3.0|Not that this is anywhere near a pop album, but his guitar work wasn't really in the forefront of this record (which isn't too bad of a thing since he had some pretty good singers on the record).  Only a couple of decent solos... did have more soul & funk attached to it.  Yeah, I'm being unfair in my comparison, but I thought he was trying to bring MTV to him vice bringing his music to MTV... & what does he do?? .... lead w/People Get Ready w/Rod Stewart who was already in bed w/MTV.  Carmine Appice does some nice work on this record.
0316286850|4.0|Kevyn Aucoin is definitely everything his reputation says he is.  This book is excellent, informative, and extremely well put together.   <br /> <br />The only down side of it is he does not address Asian beauty.  He address caucasian, black, and latin, but not asian... so Asians, this will be good if you want to learn about how to work on all the mentioned faces, but your own...not so much.  For those asians whose eyes do not pleat (hooded eyes, or non-creased eyes) this book will not help you dress those and rare style of eyes.   <br /> <br />His technique is fantastic and I like his commentaries, very down to earth, though his work is outta-this-world amazing.
0792165020|5.0|What makes `The Talented Mr. Ripley' stand apart from most other thrillers is that it's ultimately an extremely smart film.  Not only is the cast superb but the script is brilliant, and that is due to the amazing novel written by Patricia Highsmith in which the film was based.  Set during the 1950's, the film follows Tom Ripley (played with every bit of underlying menace by Matt Damon) as he enters a new life, a life he could only dream about having as his own. <br /> <br />The film starts with Tom, a con-artist, borrowing a Princeton jacket during a Manhattan garden party to play the piano for guests, and he inadvertently strikes up a conversation with an older gentleman who's seeking someone to retrieve his son from Italy.  He offers $1,000 and so Tom plays along, claiming to know this mans son and agrees to fetch his son from his debaucheries life.  Upon arriving in Italy Tom immediately becomes absorbed in the lifestyle this man, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law in his finest hour), is living.  He attaches himself, to the point of annoyance, to both Dickie and his fiancée Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This attachment that borderlines obsession finally climaxes in Dickie claiming Tom should leave, go back to the states. <br /> <br />He's boring. <br /> <br />And with those words Tom kills the man he loves in a fit of rage, and in an attempt to cover it up he assumes the identity of the man he murdered and from that point on the film changes pace to that of a cat and mouse tail and Tom switches between playing a role and living a life.  To cover his tracks Tom tells Marge that Dickie was scared off by her pressure to commit himself in marriage and thus has fled the country.  She doesn't believe it for one minute and she starts to put pieces together, realizing that this man is not the kind hearted fellow he claims to be.  As Tom starts a relationship with a wealthy woman under the alias of Dickie Greenleaf, yet falls in and out of contact with Marge and fellow friends of Dickie who know Tom he has to keep changing his identity and forging letters and his voice in order to stay ahead of the game. <br /> <br />Brilliantly crafted, like a fine sculpture, each frame fits together beautifully and creates a piece of art like none other.  The acting is astonishing, most notably by the two male leads, Jude and Matt.  I will say that I am not a Matt Damon fan, and actually other than this film I feel he's a wasted talent, but here he exuberates every emotion that makes up this madman he embodies.  We feel every emotion that he needs and wants us to feel.  He is pitch-perfect.  Same with Law, who plays the playboy type brilliantly.  His constant growing annoyance with Tom is seen all over his face.  In scenes like when he walks in on Tom wearing his clothing or when Tom asks him if they could share a bath, Jude's face says more than his words ever could. <br /> <br />Gwyneth was another delight, as the confused and suspicious fiancée of the deceased she plays the misunderstood yet defiantly insistent card brilliantly, convincing you that she's either 1) crazy or 2) right on the money. <br /> <br />Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kate Blanchett both have very small roles, but there roles are strong none the less, and they deliver each line effortlessly.  This was my first glimpse at Hoffman and I'm almost tempted to say he deserved that Oscar nod over Law only because he was PERFECT in the few moments he graced the screen.  My favorite scene in the film involves Hoffman's character catching Tom in the act of watching Marge and Dickie make love on their boat.  \\"Tommy, Tommy, are you peeping Tommy?\\"  It's brilliant. <br /> <br />So I've praised this movie quite a bit and I hope that my review has helped convince you to 1) see this movie if you haven't already or 2) if you have seen it and can't decide whether or not to purchase it, maybe this review helped remind you how purchase worthy a film like this really is.  Kudos to everyone involved, from the brilliant acting already raved about to the wonderful direction Anthony Minghella took while making this exceptionally extraordinary film. <br /> <br />Pure cinematic brilliance!
B00006LIRI|5.0|If you like U2 and you need to conserve space and/or the number of CDs you maintain, this CD and its companion greatest hits are great. They have the selections you want to hear repeatedly already compiled for you. You do not have to rip selections from five CDs to create the one you want to enjoy over and over.
B00003CX8U|3.0|All That Jazz never fully got my attention while veiwing this musical last summer. First of all, the dance numbers are incredible, based on Bob Fosse's life on and off stage, this atuobiographical tale can be a bit tedious and melodramatic at times. Some of the nude scenes I thought were unnecessary. I felt this musical was more of a drama than a musical. Great performances from the entire cast just not my kind of musical, oh well, Fosse was a genius in the dance world but as a director he was just alright.
0316287059|4.0|I love Kevyn Aucoin and his talent.  He's amazing with his brushes and colors.   <br /> <br />Just like Making Faces, he does not have many asian models on whose face he created a look.  His only asian face is Lucy Liu; even hers is not representative of the race.   <br /> <br />Not to discount his work, this is a fabulous look for everyone.  If you are learning to do asian make-up, I would try a different book.  I have not really found a book which is good for asian make-up but Nars isn't too bad.  Much love to Mr. Aucoin, may he rest in peace
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I will be biased and say that the Phantom is one of if not the best stage play ever written.  I've seen it 5+ times and never get tired of it.  I was a bit ancy when this film was released mostly because I've seen the movie and none of them compair to the play (although I will say that if you see any of the films the Argento's because instead of trying to recreate the atmosphere he creates his own and it works on a higher level).  When I heard that Emmy Rossum was playing Christine I got excited because I know she's good, and although I had heard nothing about this Butler guy playing the Phantom I figured he had to be good, right?  I do wish that Bandaras had played the Phantom since he has a brilliant voice, and my only complaint about this film is that Butler has a horrid voice, but as far as theatrics are concerned he plays a brilliant Phantom.  The film follows Andrew Lloyd Webber's play almost scene for scene execpt for one additional graveyard scene where the Phantom and Christines lover (Patrick Wilson) fight.  The sets the costumes and the acting, and for the most part the singing, is brilliant (Emmy Rossum is just out of this world) and it will leave you mezmerized!  Minnie Driver has one of my favorite roles as Carlotta and she is as histerical as she is wicked.  All in all it's Hollywood at it's best, with Schumacher doing a brilliant job bringing this classic to the big screen, and doing it better than anyone ever has.  I'm glad Emmy was cast, although Katie Holmes (who was origionally cast until she had to back out for another project) would have been good if not great, Emmy already has proven to have the pipes and I feel Katie wouldn't have been able to stack (although I hear that she was taking voice lessons for the role, and if you've seen Abandon then you'll know she can sing).  Anyways, bottom line is see the movie...for if you loved the play you'll love the film and if you've never seen the play then watching this masterpiece will make you give itserious thought!
0375701427|5.0|Roth's takes its place in the canon of novels about Vietnam, and the social derangement across the lines of class which accompanied it in America.  Perhaps the recent NYT best of the past 25 years panel had it right about this book.  Unlike some other Zuckerman narrations, Roth's imagination fully inhabits Swede Levov within his componential personality, politics, philosophy and family.  There were times when I wanted to grab and choke one character or another, perhaps Philip, a former professor of mine, himself -- \\"a gripping read.\\"
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is the pinnacle of Hard Rock, the greatest spectical ever witnessed in music.  Words can't describe it, the feeling you get when this is in your dvd player.  Nothing and i mean nothing not even other AC/DC realeases come close to this, this puts everything  to shame.  The musical performances themselves are top notch (what else would you expect from the Rock Gods)i don't think there is one mistake in this whole performance, nup i thought of one, the solo in let there be rock Ang has a little slip up.  Many reviewers have been sceptical of doctoring with this release, the concert footage its self has been glossed up, in both the audio and visual departments, but as for complete overdubs there are one or two, buit its not like what some reviews have said, that the whole concert has been tampered with, if it had been i dont think they would have missed the obvious mistake Ang makes in the solo of LTBR.    Musically Everyones perfect, Brian, Ang, Mal, Cliff and yep big Chris Slade.  Slade adds another dimension to AC/DC, a powerhouse on drums.  Not that there was anything wrong with old Phil, i think Chris just gives the band a bit more power (if thats humanly possible, but then again its AC/DC anything's possible).  Ang shreds some amazing solos, showing his absolute mastery of the guitar, in my opinion theres only two men alive or dead that can match Angus, they are: Toni Iommi (black sabbath) and Jimmy Page (led zeppelin), but still in my mind Ang has it over them.  As for the visual show, well 26 cameras and a helicopter filming you can't get better coverage than that, the concert is filmed perfectly.  The stage visuals well once again its AC/DC they always deliver the goods, you get an awesome stage design (multistorey), various massive inflateable devils and of corse Rosie, Ang and the podium in the middle of the crowd makes another appearance, and just when you think how can they possible put another awesome stage visual that tops that, well once again its AC/DC, for the encore you get 21 fully loaded cannons firering their arses off way up over the crowd.    Nothing chalenges this concert, its the single greatest 2 hours of music in history.  So don't read anymore reviews, stop thinking should i shouldn't i and go out and buy it, don't be a [...] and download it. cheers.
0060005696|5.0|I've been trying to express to friends that the problem with dating in a big city (NYC - where I live) is that everyone is paralyzed with indecision. I've tried to explain that the rise of the internet as a gateway to connect to people with whom you would otherwise never come in touch has led to higher overall rates of depression and isolation. Then... I found this book: I was so relieved that I wasn't just crazy :) If you live in NYC (or any densely populated city) or have used the internet in the past 5 years, you should be able to relate to, and will likely agree with, its basic premise.
B000002MY3|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD...and in my opinion this has to be one of the best debut's ever released.  Alanis has an untouched passion, a voice that's unique in it's own pain and a writing ability that masters the very best.  Track after track on this brilliant album Alanis improves on perfection.  The standout here is of course the first single 'You Oughta Know' which is directed to the guy who played Joey on Full House.  SUpposedly he treated her pretty bad when they dated (I think she was like 15) and now she's pissed.  The lyrics though are some of the best I've heard, really ring true to the feelings of one abused and used.  The other singles stand out as well, the hapy go lucky feel to 'ONe Hand in my Pocket' or the trueism's to both 'You Learn' and 'Ironic' both of which helped to catapult her mass appeal.  Alanis has a distict voice, one that you will always recognize as signature and shere brilliance, and because she remains unpolished and raw she always has this feeling of genuinity, she always appears real.  You can believe her, and that makes for great music!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The following review is by someone who calls themselves \\"Movie Reviewer\\", someone who likes Kathy Griffin and thinks Desperate Housewives is the best show ever...\\"LET ME GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, IT ISN'T ONE STAR, BUT 0. THIS WAS THE WORST PIECE OF TRASH BATMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN. OKAY, IN ALL THE BATMAN MOVIES, THERE IS AN AUTHENTIC BATMAN VILLIAN, THERE ISN'T IN THIS ONE. AND, WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THE SCARECROW IS IN IT, IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF. I MEAN, THIS JERK PUTS ON A SCARECROW MASK, AND SAYS BOO. WOW, REALLY FRIGHTENING. AT LEAST THE JOKER WAS A MOBSTER, MR. FREEZE HAD HIS FREEZY GUN, ETC. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVIE. BATMAN AND ROBIN WAS THE BEST ONE YET, THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED IT THAT WAY. AND ANOTHER THING, PEOPLE ARE LIKE I HOPE THEY MAKE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. THINK ABOUT IT, IT THIS IS WHERE HE BECOMES BATMAN, AND AT THE END YOU FIND OUT THEY PICK UP WITH THE ORIGINAL, THERE CAN'T BE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. IF ANYONE WOULD EVEN WANT TO MAKE ONE, THEY SHOULD BE SHOT IMMEDIATLY. PASS UP THIS PIECE OF TRASH, AND WATCH THE BEST BATMAN: BATMAN AND ROBIN.\\" <br /> <br />This person cites Batman And Robin as the best Batman film. I need not say more but I will anyway...Freezy thing? Second this is a revamp of a series that was killed thanks to the film this person cited as the best Batman film.I guess something did come out of Batman and Robin: people to mock for their stupidity and the realization from Warners that something had to be done to give Batman back his integrity and they did that ten-fold with Batman Begins.
B00005JOQS|4.0|The cast are all marvelous, and the special effects are great.  Brandon Routh is a great Superman.  The \\"hook\\" of this film is very appealing: Superman has been gone for nearly five years, and has to remind the woman he loves, and the world, that he still matters.      This is a daunting task that weighs heavily upon our hero.  With almost every frame, we are reminded of how ironic Superman's existence is: the world loves him, looks up to him, yet he is totally disconnected from it.     Now here's what I didn't like.  This film pretty much sticks to the same formula as the 1978 film.  Lex Luthor, Superman's arch enemy, is just a wealthy thug.  In the more modern comic, he actually becomes president of the United States.  He's still evil, but he manages to fool the masses into thinking that he's good.  The Lex of the present- day comic book is smarter, more manipulative, and less comical than the Lex of yesteryear.  Lex's \\"respectability\\" and greater aptitude for deception makes him a more formidable opponent in today's Superman Comic.     This could have been an interesting scenario for this series, but seems unlikely given the ending of this film.      But we'll see...    EXCUSE ME WHILE I RANT    Countless people keep comparing Routh to Reeve, Spacey to Hackman, etc.  This is  absurd! The first Reeve film is now 18 years old!  People should respect the fact that this is a very different vision for a different generation.  Going back to the Richard Donner version  as a point of comparison is anoying and silly.  This film should be viewed on ITS OWN MERITS.
B000083E79|4.0|I am satisfied, it shows all her carrier and all songs are great.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Several other reviews seem to confuse the characterisations from the older series of movies with these.  The entire movie is more serious.  Okay, Lois isn't nutty as she was with Margot Kidder, but she is facing different things.  Noel Neill, the Lois of the TV series, makes a wonderful cameo in this movie, dying in scene one.  But she was on the train in Superman, the Movie, too.  Jack Larsen, the bartender, was, for those who don't remember, Jimmy Olsen in the TV series of the 50s.  It was a nice gesture (and not an empty one either) to include them in this movie.  There is obviously room for sequels, but that's fine, because this movie lives up to the series of the past.  Singer gets sensitive performances from everyone, particularly Routh who is not just a pretty face (although he is) but also a very good actor.  Chemistry is actually strong enough to warrant the obvious SR II and SR III. <br />Now, if only Warner Bros. would issue the original 4 movie set as I've read it might be issued - two versions of Superman II, and the original version of Superman IV.  I'd like to see those.
B000063UR2|5.0|this movie is by far one of my favorite older movies. i love watching this movie.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). The BBC celebrated in 2005 by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodes from the rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />SET features the companion series DR. WHO CONFIDENTIAL, a behind the scenes show that ran concurrently providing an episode for all 13 shows supplying fun chart toping tunes to film footage, interviews and more. Set also includes commentaries by cast and crew actually worth listening to!!<br /><br />Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any \\"new\\" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.<br /><br />The PILOT story: \\"ROSE\\" introduces his new companion Rose Tyler who is attacked by mannequins (or AUTONS) in the department store where she works. She meets the Doctor and the pair end up fighting to save the world. The pacing of this one, like most of the 13 new episodes, is like lightning, and the Autons have never been scarier. The TARDIS (interior) has never looked better or bigger.<br /><br />Next in \\"THE END of the WORLD\\" The Doctor offers Rose a chance to go anyplace, anytime, they end up 5 Billion years in the future above the Earth just before it ends. But someone has sabotaged the very observation satellite they're on. Not a bad episode, it shoots very high with a \\"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" motif and cinematically accomplishes it, also reveals that the Doctor is the \\"Last of the Timelords.\\"<br /><br />In the episodes 4 & 5 \\"ALIENS of LONDON\\" & \\"WORLD WAR III.\\" The Doctor takes Rose home (mistakenly) 12 months later. We  FINALLY learn what happens back home when a companion up and leaves with the Doctor. The pair deal with Rose's Mum, who thought she was dead, and the ex-boyfriend who has been the main suspect. But when a spaceship crashes in the Thames in an \\"stunning\\" sequence which sets new standards for TV effects, the whole world goes on Red Alert, and the Doctor is noticed by the Government.

B00000JPH6|5.0|this is one of the greatest muppet movies of all time! I love this movie and can't wait to share it with my children.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's X and Y is a truly great CD. All the songs are catchy,uptempo, and unique. Chris's voice and soaring piano melodies are awe-inspiring.The lyrics are deep and relatable.  My personal favorites are Square One, Talk, White Shadows, and Hardest Part. I really enjoyed this album because of the fact that there were no slow songs that really dragged, which, from what I've seen, is a rarity in many so called \\"alternative\\" CD's.If you are a fan of A Rush of Blood to the Head, you will really enjoy this CD. WARNING: These songs WILL get stuck in your head...
B000E6ESL2|2.0|I know that some people may see this low review and instantly dismiss it, but I beg those few to hear me out. I wanted to love this movie, I like all kinds of films and the movie's premise and dark style drew me in and led me to buy it. Let me start and say Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite young actors, Bob Hoskins I've loved since \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", and director Marc Forster is a good one. That being said the film doesn't ultimately make any sense, atleast in my mind. If that doesn't bother you, then that is fine. The acting is good, there are some intense scenes, some people may be dead, or in a dreamlike state but I couldn't honestly tell you to save my life. What I do know is that I truly love movies..and I have never left a movie feeling so ultimately unsatisfied as I did after \\"Stay\\".
B000001FAS|5.0|I agree wholeheartely with all or most all of the reviews listed but must respectfully disagree with finulanu's comment that the Allman Brothers magnum opus, Mountain Jam, is too long. It is in my opinion one blissfully long magnificent piece of music that is  as good or even better than any Dead jam. I bought the double Lp back in the early 70's and painfully remember having to dig out and switch vinyl on the turntable (each half of Mountain Jam on seperate records) right in the middle of my Dickey Betts air guitar solo !!!<br /><br />Now that Eat a Peach is on cd, I can hear Mountain Jam soar from blissfull begining to magnificent end without interuption.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|\\"Silent Hill\\" is hands down the hardest \\"R\\" rated film I've seen in the theaters in years. It is also among the darkest. Wonderfully directed by Christope Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf)and starring Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Man on Fire). \\"Silent Hill\\" is intense and very fun to watch. The CGI is very convincing, and the plot..while at times is pretty confusing, ultimately gets you thinking...and that's a good thing. Well thought out and executed film that gives you the thrills, chills, effects and gore no horror buff can do without. Check this one out, it won't disappoint.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Based on Stephen Ambrose's best-selling book, Band Of Brothers the DVD is a visual masterpiece, shocking at times and sweet at others.  The acting in this series is top-notch with great performances by: Damian Lewis (Why is this guy not in more movies/TV shows?!), Donnie Wahlberg (Marky Mark's bro), Ron Livingston (From Office Space!), David Schwimmer (Ross!), Frank John Hughes (Very Funny as SSgt. William 'Wild Bill' Guarnere), and a small appearance by Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks' son).  Everyone in Band Of Brothers is believable and when it shows the documentaries of the real people that the actors are portraying, it gives it that much more impact and authenticity.  There are ten episodes of Band of Brothers (see the review above by K. Wyatt \\"ssintrepid\\" for more detail).  Watching Band of Brothers showed me why they were the greatest generation with all the hardships that they endured and we could all learn from them.  My only problem with this near flawless DVD was that was an awful lot of swearing.  I guess that was accurate, but it made me feel differently about the soldiers and what their values were.  All in all, this is a must see and when you get the concentration camp disc, you will see, along with the soldiers, why the war was more than worth fighting.
B00004S8Q9|4.0|Well, I finally got a copy of this album.  I just discovered that it existed only a few months ago while searching Amazon and knew I had to have it because of how much I enjoyed \\"Badlands\\" and \\"Voodoo Highway\\". <br /> <br />Going into this not having heard a single song from the album was refreshing, yet the expectations were also high after loving nearly every song from the bands first two albums.  The album started right with \\"Healer\\" and from there it was enjoyable, but not great.  Nothing holds a candle to their debut album! <br /> <br />I have had this CD in my car for the last week, just playing it over and over during my commute to and from work.  3 songs now stand out as my favorites...\\"Healer\\", Lord Knows\\" and \\"Ride the Jack\\". <br /> <br />I wouldn't spend big money to get an original copy of this.  I ended up getting what appears to be a fairly professional copy?  Not sure, but the liner notes are just blurry enough to be unreadable.  I had to come here to get a track list, just to see the titles of the songs I liked the best.  I do recommend owning it though if you liked the rest of the Badlands offerings.
038073186X|5.0|Welcome to Shutter Island, Dennis Lehane's high octane thriller roller coaster where nothing is was it seems.  Who can you trust?  What can you trust?  Where are the clues leading?  These are the questions that, like a TV like Lost, gives you one answer and then leads you to ask 3 more.  Dennis Lehane gives us a great protagonist in Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule.  They are led to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of a female mental institution patient named Rachel.  Lehane tops it off with a wonderful backstory of Teddy's dead, murdered wife and haunting flashbacks (his wife was killed by a current patient that Teddy is searching for).  What ensues is conspiracy theories about what is REALLY going on the island.  And the most haunting question...what lies inside the lighthouse?  Lehane gives great dialogue between the characters and plenty of humor without interrupting the suspense.  As you race through the pages, you will ask, \\"Can Teddy escape the island?\\"  If he can break the codes and his own fears, he has a shot.  My only problem with this novel was excessive swearing, which seems typical in Lehane novels.  Other than, though, this was the best book I have read this year!
B00005JOQS|3.0|I absolutely loved Batman Begins and Spiderman 2, so I went to see Superman Returns with high hopes of seeing another great movie.  Unfortunately, I left the theater thinking that it was just average.<br /><br />I really liked Routh as the new Superman - I think he had a big cape to fill, and he did a nice job.  He really made this character his own and showed that the man of steel had some vulnerabilities.  I thought Bosworth was a pretty good Lois Lane.  The special effects were good and some of the action scenes were quite gripping.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the overall storyline.  I think it was simple and weak, and that made the 2 and 1//2 hours drag at times.  Not a lot of imagination was put into the plot and story and that is a shame since I think this movie had the potential to be a lot more interesting and a lot more exciting.
B000F7CMRW|3.0|this movie was such a disapointment!!!!<br /><br />it wasn't what i was expecting!!!<br /><br />well i rated with 3 stars and i have nothing else to tell about this :P<br /><br />oh i forgot!!!<br /><br />yeah...<br /><br />1. good casting<br /><br />2. nice scene when the little kid dies... (that didnt sound pretty) O_o i hope u get it ;)<br /><br />3. nice explosives i guess =)
B00005AREQ|5.0|...Or at least one of about 25 albums that belong in the \\"Essential Fusion\\" Hall of Fame(along with albums such as \\"Birds of Fire\\",\\"Thrust\\",\\"Romantic Warrior\\",\\"Unorthodox Behavior\\",\\"Believe IT\\",\\"Black Market\\",\\"In a Silent Way\\",\\"Spectrum\\",\\"Enigmatic Ocean\\",\\"School Days\\",\\"Elegant Gypsy\\".....Need I continue?). Though a little \\"Bluesy\\" for my  tastes in fusion,it is a defining testament of what I know to be the jazz-rock genre. It combines,as any music calling itself fusion should, a blend of different musical styles...jazz,rock,world,Latin and, in this case,Blues. And as we've all come to expect with this type of music, there's plenty of Virtoustic playing, shifting time meters and solos to be heard on this release. What did it for me with Blow by Blow can be described in one word...THE GROOVE! This album just has a wonderful vibe and Flow about it---the title was no coincidence...these songs literally come at you like punches from a Prize Fighter(often one song flowing into the next). There is also a great diversity of music represented on this album. The listener will certainly find something in this mixed-bag to \\"latch onto\\"---The intense jamming on tunes like \\"Air Blower\\" and \\"Scatterbrain\\"; The Funky grooves of \\"You Know What I Mean\\", \\"Constipated Duck\\" and \\"Thelonious\\"; The Rockin' \\"Freeway Jam\\" and the mellower moods of \\"Cause We've Ended...\\" and \\"Diamond Dust\\". So if you are looking for \\"more adventurous\\" sounds and are just starting to explore this music form that we have dubbed \\"Fusion\\", this is a MUST BUY. As a side note, I would strongly recommend his follow up to this one,\\"Wired\\",as well as any of the above mentioned Albums/Artists. Have Fun with this one! Jeff
B00005JP0A|3.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is based on Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel about a nice, ordinary young girl who experiences a drastic reality check when she takes a job with a large fashion magazine in New York City. Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) always dreamed of becoming a writer, but the only job she manages to land is a position at Runway magazine working as the second assistant to the editor-in-chief. To say that Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is an extremely difficult boss would be an understatement. She is cold, condescending, relentless, and impossibly demanding. Miranda can't understand why Andrea is unable to book her on a flight out of Miami even though the city is at the mercy of a hurricane and no flights are being allowed to take off. She also has no problem insisting that Andrea track down two copies of the new and UNPUBLISHED Harry Potter book...what's so hard about that?! Andrea soon learns that working for Miranda is a full-time job. Her phone is constantly ringing with Miranda-related emergencies, and Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) begins to suffer as a result.<br /><br />Needless to say, working for Miranda turns Andrea's life upside down. Not only is she stuck working for the devil herself, but Andrea is completely out of place in the fashion world. Her wardrobe consists of baggy sweaters and scruffy ballet flats, but all the other girls at Runway show up to work in stiletto heels and Chanel dresses. Eventually, Andrea's coworker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) takes pity on her and helps her \\"dress the part\\" by providing her with designer samples from the magazine's clothing collection...but will a chic new look be enough to help Andrea survive in the evil fashion industry?<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie was a pretty good adaptation of Weisberger's novel. Some things were changed in order to trim down the script and provide additional comic relief, but it wasn't anything major. However, the one major difference between the book and the movie is that Miranda shows signs of compassion and weakness in the film. Granted, they are very BRIEF moments of compassion and weakness, but as a result the character loses some of the viciousness that she possesses in the book. I was also disappointed by the way Andrea's relationship with fashion playboy Christian (Simon Baker) was handled in the film and the way the big Paris confrontation scene between Andrea and Miranda was completely toned down. My guess is that the producers didn't want to use the \\"F\\" word in a PG-13 film, but COME ON! Fans of the book were completely robbed of that magical moment.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is by far the best thing about this movie...however, I think she's too good for this film. Nothing else about \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a match for Streep's excellent performance. I thought that Anne Hathaway was okay as Andrea, but she kind of annoyed me...of course, Andrea's character is kind of annoying in general, so maybe that's all it is. Still, I was expecting more. (At least the clothes were great, though! WOW! But Andrea gave her Paris clothes to EMILY?! What's up with that?! And Emily gets hit by a CAR?! WHY?! Why did they make such silly changes like that?!)<br /><br />Overall, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoyed Weisberger's book. However, the best thing about the book is the character of Miranda, and I was disappointed that her nastiness was underplayed in the film (through no fault of Streep's...this is just a script issue).between the book and the movie is that Miranda shows signs of compassion and weakness in the film.

B00000FC5H|5.0|If you enjoy music from Earth, Wind, and Fire, you will enjoy this CD.  Although I'm not an EW&F afficionado, this CD seems to have all of their most common hits.  I bought it because I liked the song \\"Fantasy\\" as well as a few others, but realized that I was familiar with nearly all the songs on the CD.  This CD is well worth the price for anyone that likes even a few of this group's songs.
1573225517|5.0|This is my first Nick Hornby book. I also have seen the movie based on the book several times and would say that it makes my \\"top five\\" movies, or at least top five comedies.  With that experience, I have John Cusack and Jack Black quotes burned in my head and I was acutely aware of the differences between the book and movie (it does transfer well, though).  So I enjoyed the book immensely but made comparisons throughout.  <br /> <br />The book has perhaps a little more acid to it - it's in a gritty part of London and the protagonist comes across as, well, less nice and less attractive than Cusack.  I am not saying this is bad - the book perhaps has a more realistic feel to it.  Hornby has a sharp wit and gets inside the 30 year old unmarried male brain perfectly.  The book's language, while not particularly sophisticated (we are talking about an non-college educated record shop owner), flows nicely. <br /> <br />Read this book (add a bullet for emphasis)!
B000059XUI|5.0|In the beginning of the original Superman we see Jor-el trap Zod and his followers in the Phantom Zone. In this one Superman stops a nuclear war-head from going off by throwing it into the sun. The explosion is enough to free Zod and his followers from the Phantom Zone. Which is bad timing since Lois finds out that Clark is Superman and he decides to become human and setlle down with her. While Zod is causing chaos all over the world, Clark can't even handle a bully truck driver in a diner. So he has to decide what's more important, his relationship with Lois Lane or becoming Superman again to save the world. What a clever plot!!<br /><br />  Superman 2 is a true classic with Terrance Stamp as a truly awesome Zod. He gives one of the best villian performances ever. In Smallville recently, they had Zod go in Lex's body. It bugged me that they had him kiss Lana. I knocked that part in a forum. I had people writing back saying that he was in the Phantom Zone for a long time and they didn't blame him for kissing Lana. But come on, the Zod here was also stuck in the Phantom Zone and all he cared about was ruling Earth and kicking Superman's butt. You don't see him kissing every woman he sees because he didn't get any action in the Phantom Zone lol. This Zod would've just thrown Lana off the roof or just make her bow down to him. He's a truly ruthless and scary villian.
0792839749|4.0|This is a classic musical that I grew up watching on network tv. It has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys. I bought it to share with my kids and they loved it.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman may be over 20 years old but it's still not out-dated and works for todays audience. It's a true classic with Christopher Reeves 100% becoming not only the role of Superman but Clark Kent as well. He's the best Superman and also the best Clark Kent. He had the bumbling reporter thing down pat better than Brandon Routh did in Superman Returns or Dean Cain in Lois and Clark. He also had great chemestry with Margot Kidder who played Lois Lane. The scene where he takes her flying with him is still magical and special. Eventhough I really liked Superman Returns, the scene where he flys with Lois is easily forgettable compared to the scene in this movie.<br /><br />  The film also has the late great Marlon Brando as Superman's dad Jor-el in the beginning of the movie. In the Fortress of Solitude Clark is able to learn everything that he needs to know about his father and where he came from. He then becomes Superman and makes himself known to the world by saving Lois Lane. His skills are about to be put to the test by Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) who's about to start world chaos.<br /><br />  Gene Hackman makes a really good Lex eventhough he was stubborn about wearing a bald cap or even shaving his mustache for the director. It's funny how Richard Donner got him to shave though. He put on a fake mustache and told Gene he'd shave if he did. Gene shaved and said \\"you're turn\\" and Richard said \\"ok\\" and just pulled off the mustache. Gene looked at him mad but then started laughing. I remember Richard Donner talking about that on a director show. Anyway Gene at least wears the bald cap for like a second at the end of the movie and in the beginning of Supeman 2. He shows that Lex doesn't need to be bald the whole movie to still be an evil and calculated mad-man though. He still did the part well. While Ned Beatty is also excellent as his dimwitted side-kick Otis. With this movie being so well made and being a great start to the Superman franchise. It's very sad that part 3 and 4 were failures. Christopher Reeves deserved a much better last Superman movie than Superman 4 since he was the perfect Superman.3 and 4 were failures. Christopher Reeves deserved a much better last Superman movie than Superman 4 since he was the perfect Superman.
B00000F14B|4.0|Robert Preston is the best Professor Hill. This is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collection
B00005JOQS|1.0|I was very disappointed by this movie, as it is not so much a sequel, but rather a remake of the first film. While the visual effects and the acting were well done, this whole film felt like a carbon copy of the first. The number of lines and scenes that were directly taken from the first film and used in this film borders on plagiarism. Kevin Spacey's talent is wasted on a plot that is just a regurgitation of the original, and there is no real adversarial relationship between his Lex and Routh's Superman. Routh does an admirable job as Superman, but spends most of the film saying the exact same lines that Christopher Reeve did in the first film. This film comes off as a two and a half hour screen test for Routh. Kate Bosworth did a good job as well, but is saddled with everyone else in a copied plot with no real twists and turns. I find it hard to believe that with all the money and all the writers involved, the best that they could come up with is a remake. It almost seems that the makers of this film were so afraid of offending anyone (especially the fans) that they went down the safest route possible - remaking the original. The only added plot device (pretty much the only spoiler) involves Lois' child (as if you could not guess what that is). If this was the best that the producers could come up with, they would have been better off re-releasing the original 1978 Superman film remastered and with extended footage (as a special edition) just like George Lucas did with the Star Wars films a few years ago. Given the time and money that this studio had to make this kind of a film, is it any wonder why more and more people are staying home and not paying to see these kinds of movies in theaters?
0446343129|2.0|Although it's been some years since this book was published, I decided to give it a read for personal as well as professional reasons. I have no love for the sugar industry and avoid all forms of refined sugar, so I came to this book with a very open mind.  I'm also a diabetes educator, and I've worked with thousands of children with diabetes.  The author's historical information was interesting and enlightening.  I thought, hmm, good introduction to the topic.  Then, he started on the diabetes angle, and as each page went by I started getting more and more disgusted with the book. <br /> <br />There are two problems with his diabetes-related information.   <br /> <br />First of all, he makes no distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2.   <br /> <br />Secondly, his smug attitude toward the development of insulin is strikingly cold and lacking in understanding.  Much of the genuine information about the dangers of refined sugar is lost in the author's seeming obsession with belittling the development and use of insulin.   <br /> <br />To be more specific, without going on forever: <br />The development of type 2 diabetes is certainly related to modern lifestyle choices and poor nutrition.  However, many adults with type 2 are thin and don't fit the usual \\"profile.\\"  Most people with type 2 do not use insulin at the onset of their disease, and may never use insulin if they lose weight and improve their nutrition and physical activity.   <br /> <br />Type 1 diabetes, however, is an autoimmune disease whose development is not related to lifestyle.  It has been documented in ancient cultures (contrary to the author's claim), and always led to death at an early age, until the discovery of insulin in 1920 by Banting and Best.  Again, contrary to what the author might lead one to believe, they did not win the Nobel prize so that millions of sugar-addicted adults (with type 2 diabetes) could continue to indulge in sweet-eating;  they won it because the discovery of insulin, even it's most crude form at that time, enabled thousands of children and young adults to live with diabetes (type 1).   <br /> <br />The author's obvious distain for the \\"insulin industry\\" is an ignorant slap in the fact to every parent of every child who has type 1 diabetes.  Over the years, insulin therapy for type 1 has become increasingly refined, and it is no longer necessary to suffer the extreme swings in blood glucose alluded to by the author, (as if Eli Lilly and Co. personally takes joy in the misery of people with diabetes).   <br /> <br />If you want to know the truth about insulin, you would do better to read \\"The Discovery of Insulin\\" by Michael Bliss.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I have played all of the silent hill games and loved them. I was very excited when I saw that they were making a Silent Hill movie. I saw it immediately when it was released here in my city and enjoyed the movie very much. The music and sounds in the movie is one of the main aspects of the movie that made the movie exciting and yet very dark and intense. I love horror movies and think this is a very good gothic horror movie in my opinion. I love the grotesque monsters in the movie and watching the movie made me feel like I was actually playing the game. The story was hard to understand, although I understood certain parts of it but after going back to the movie theatre to see it again two more times(because I loved it) I understood the movie more and more. There are things in the movie that are very heavy in meaning and symbolic. I can't wait to see it on dvd and I have already pre-ordered it. I hope that there will be more silent hill games and movies soon.
B000FMGTTE|3.0|This soundtrack is well done.  I really enjoy listening to all the songs, but my fav. ones are #1, #6, and the last one.  but its all good.  I listened to it on my way to the movie with my friends and all of us wearing our superman shirts!!  Well done Mr. Ottaman, maybe Williams can do the next one.  That would be even better, even though this one is great!!!  Go buy it huh!! I actually give it 4 1/2 stars not 3.
B00005MP58|5.0|A faithful screenplay - none compares. Colin Firth is magical in the role of Mr. Darcy. The casting on this project was so excellently done, the interpretations of the characters by each of the actors has to be one of the most outstanding I have ever seen. Bingly's sisters are perfectly snobby. Elizabeth's mother is perfectly hystrionic. Lydia is perfectly shallow and silly. Mary is perfectly prudish. Jane is perfectly good. Bingly is perfectly foppish, yet with an air of manliness - not often seen in this role. Mr. Darcy is perfectly proud with a strong sense of integrity that, together with his overall subtle machismo, is absolutely irresistable. Elizabeth's beauty is tolerable, I suppose - just kidding. She is perfectly lovely and strong. Even the minor character castings are amazingly perfect: Mr. Collins, Charlotte, Mr. & Mrs. Gardner, Wickham - perfect. Why Hollywood tried to remake Pride & Prejudice after A&E's timelessly perfect production is beyond me. Hollywood's latest version's casting is off, the characters underdeveloped and the screenplay embellishments completely miss Jane Austen's romantic subtlety based in context of its period. I think the A&E version should be re-released as a feature film with an intermission.

0380778556|1.0|I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending.

B00005Y7AW|4.0|Rufus's second album really is what the title claims: an album of poses--that is, facades--where the appearance of the wizard and the man behind the curtain are not at all the same.<br /><br />A prime example is \\"Greek Song,\\" nominally a plea for the Mediterranean object of desire to forget everything and sink into some kind of bronzed, sportscar-riding fantasy land.  \\"All the pearls of China fade astride a Volta.\\"  Why then, with this plea to the Greek god of eros, does the music come from China (by employing a kind of pseudo-Asian pentatonicism, complete with what surely is an erhu-influenced violin solo)?  In other words, why does the music illustrate the very thing the Mediterranean object of desire is being asked to forget?  The \\"pose\\" of the words and the language of the music are working against each other.<br /><br />Then we have the absolutely intriguing \\"Grey Gardens.\\"  I am not the only reviewer who has been fascinated by the bizarre mixture of references in the lyrics.  Just in case, the song opens with a sample of \\"Little Edie\\" Bouvier commenting on the difficulty of separating past and present, taken from the 1975 documentary \\"Grey Gardens;\\" the name Tadzio, heard throughout the song, seems to refer to the boy with whom the character Aschenbach is infatuated in Thomas Mann's novella \\"Death in Venice.\\"  (See also Visconti's film (1971) & Benjamin Britten's powerful opera (1973), both of the same title.)  Whatever these elements might mean to Rufus personally, for the listener the obvious idea linking \\"Grey Gardens\\" and \\"Death in Venice\\" is that very often a powerful divide exists between what society demands and what one's personal desires urge.  Aschenbach and the Bouviers are lost to society, having chosen to follow (or having fallen victim to) their own desire; nevertheless, Rufus's lyrics make a plea to Tadzio to get him through this crisis, presumably to return to society.  This is curious. Here again, the lyricist is praying to a Mediterranean god of eros.  But how can you ask the object of desire to rid you of your desire for him?  You can't, quite simply!  And that's the point: it's all a pose in that the lyricist doesn't really want to be rid of the crisis at all.  Analytically, I think Rufus has used the classic Schubertian technique of modal mixture (major/minor third scale degree) to embody the conflict between society and desire, but even at the end of the song, where one might expect the music to 'solve' the problem, the mixture is still present: the music doesn't want to shake free of the crisis, despite all the clamor from the lyrics.<br /><br />A final quick example can be found in \\"One Man Guy\\" (Nick Hornby speaks a little about this in his \\"31 Songs\\" (1993)), a song by Rufus's father, Loudon.  Despite the fact that the lyrics are about a man who is fundamentally a creature of solitude, when the first proper chorus starts, Rufus is joined by a vocal ensemble.  How can you sing \\"One Man Guy\\" in chorus?  It's a pose.  Yet again, the music and the lyrics are at odds.ow can you ask the object of desire to rid you of your desire for him?

I got this along with John Mayers two most recent albums. (Those are the ish by the way) but this is a change in sound for me but I like. Looking forward this Alternative rock genre already. Favorite: Speed of Sound....duh!!

1400032717|2.0|As much as my friends bragged up this book, I was really expecting something great and deep.  Unfortunately, I found the main character more annoying than endearing.  While I appreciate what the author was trying to do, I felt like the themes were being spoon-fed to me rather than being presented in an easy to understand way.  I tried really hard to like it, and I understand the innovation of the entire story, but I found it more painful than compelling.
B000FA57RG|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is amazing.  It really brings you into the tour and shows you a side of Madonna that you haven't seen before.  A must have for any true Madonna Fan!  The DVD takes you through the entire process of her Reinvention Tour and the CD is recording of the concert.  Once again, Madonna does not fail to deliver.

I love the relationship that Sulley and Boo form. Boo is definately a character of unconditional love. She is fascinated with Sullivan even though he is terrified of her. This movie really makes me laugh and I want to buy it for my 3 yr old niece.
1573223026|1.0|Review by Charles Brewer is dead on.  Characters are annoying.  You just don't care what happens to them and what happens to their relationship with each other.  If they had been annoying but endearing it would have been a whole other story... maybe one that wasn't such an irritating waste of time.   <br /> <br />I read and read thinking something must bring this mess of a boring plot together.  Nope.  I thought maybe I'm not reading it in a funny enough way.  How can it be this bad?  Everyone at book club (who bothered to finish it) said the same thing. <br /> <br />Find another book.

How can u expect this album to be same as The Infamous or Hell on Earth. Face to the reality-those days are over. Just because 50 Cent is there doesn mean that the album should be wack. If u ask me , i m deep underground fan , but i still wanted to check this out cause Mobb deep said that the album is like the albums before. And i m telling u that i m not dissapointed.From the last 2 mobb's albums i already gave up of listening them. <br />This is for everybody: Dont look at the guest appereance on the album. Search fot he good sound.

Wanted so much for \\"Mrs Bone\\" to love her Attorney, which she did, but not in the way he <br />would have liked. But also knew her heart was with the rough and tough man <br />she married and tamed.

B00005JNRY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Pixar's latest movie and here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: Selfish racecar gets stranded in a little Route 66 town with a towtruck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: 2 mild \\"bad words\\" refering to a place, and about 5 innuendos, most involving \\"nuts\\".<br /><br />Characters: 4 of 5 cars. Lots of variety in this department. Most of the characters were believable and acted accordingly, but I didn't care about them as much as I was expecting. First of all, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) was a riot. Mack the truck had an awfully familiar voice... *wink* and did a good job. The only casting choice I didn't like was Bonnie Hunt as Sally. She sounded too old for the part.<br /><br />Plot: 4 of 5 cars. Starts off with a twist, falls into a pattern for a while, then ends with a twist I didn't even see coming. Comedic bits interspersed. Pretty quality stuff.<br /><br />Animation: 5 of 5 cars. Animation like we've come to expect from Pixar. I'm sure it was hard to animate those cars' faces.<br /><br />Music: 4 of 5 cars. The songs (not original) perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I didn't find the score memorable, though.<br /><br />Impact: 3 of 5 cars. I'd say this is the most important section of the review. I did get involved in this movie when I saw it, but it wasn't a tear-jerker. The big finale didn't leave me with the sense of triumph which was essentially the whole point. I did think about this movie after I saw it, but I wasn't enamoured with it. It didn't leave me with any hard hitting thoughts on its characters, or side splitting lines to quote.<br /><br />All in all, 4 of 5 cars.
0792163710|5.0|Good vs evil, probably the best scenario for an excellent story espeically when the two are so well deleneated.  No cursing, no overt sex just a good story with good characterizations something an intelligent writer puts  forth.  There's very little intelligence exhibited in screen writing or tv writing today.  It's a lost art.  Here is an example for the ages to illustrate just how that is done.
B00005JOQS|4.0|It's been 28 years since Richard Donner's Superman flew into theatres, but back then there weren't any other comic book movies to worry about. Now there is much stiffer competition. With such films as Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 among the top of its genre, it's hard for any superhero to compete. While Bryan Singer's Superman Returns isn't as good as either of those two, it is a solid film nonetheless.<br /><br />The story takes place after the events of Superman and Superman II. Clark Kent/Superman (Routh) has been gone for 5 years searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton. Unable to find anything, he returns to Earth. But life hasn't stood still for the mild-mannered reporter, or the Man of Steel. Everyone has moved on, especially Lois Lane (Bosworth). Now a mother, engaged to Richard White (Marsden), Lane wants to forget Superman ever existed, and hasn't ever even noticed Kent exists. She has even won a Pulitzer Prize winning article entitled, \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\"<br /><br />But when she sees Superman for the first time she becomes as awe-struck as the moment she first laid eyes on him. It's also fitting that Superman has just saved her, and the other passengers, from a plane crash. Leaving by saying, \\"Well I hope this experience hasn't put any of you off flying. Statistically speaking it's still the safest way to travel.\\" It's a line that Christopher Reeve said to Margot Kidder, as he saved her from a helicopter crash, in the original movie. Thankfully Routh delivers it with all the charm and bravado as Reeve.<br /><br />Moments like that, and the many spread throughout, make the film great as it tries to pay homage to the original. But what keeps Superman Returns from greatness is its unexciting, choppy beginning. It takes the movie about a half-an-hour to get interesting. The first scene of the movie, following the title sequence, involves Lex Luthor (Spacey). Audiences haven't waited this long to see the enemy before the hero.<br /><br />Luthor, this time around, has gotten out of prison by hilarious means. \\"Well the appeals courts called Superman to the witness stand but he wasn't there, so Lex got off. How much you think that pisses off Superman?\\" says Jimmy Olsen (Huntington). \\"A lot,\\" replies Kent. Again hoping to thwart off Superman and acquire real estate, Luthor has stolen a crystal from Superman's Fortress of Solitude (his arctic recreation of Krypton) to create his own continent. Will Superman be able to stop him before America no longer exists?<br /><br />Another complaint is that I am very perplexed at how much the creators expect the audience to know the ends and outs of the first two films. There's a generation gap from when those came out! It might have been wiser to remake the original, and have Superman Returns be a sequel to that. But as is, there is little to complain about. There's love, excitement and peril. All are winning combinations, especially for summer blockbusters, which usually provide the action but not the substance.the hero. <br />  <br />Luthor, this time around, has gotten out of prison by hilarious means. \\"Well the appeals courts called Superman to the witness stand but he wasn't there, so Lex got off.

1400079179|3.0|I thought that the book was good pulp fiction, it was a fun story, something that you can get lost in while you are on a plane or vegging at the beach.  <br /> <br />But it cannot be read as reliable history, or even reliable historical fiction. Even the 'fact' page at the front of the book is fiction, and maybe the joke is on those of us who took that page a little too seriously. <br /> <br />Robert Langdon, the professor of symbology at Harvard University is on a quest to discover the true meaning of the Holy Grail, even if he cannot find the Grail itself. The story has many twists and turns, and it keeps the reader hooked to the very end. Each chapter is its own little cliffhanger, and you have to read into the next chapter to see how it is resolved. <br /> <br />Remember, IT IS JUST A NOVEL. Enjoy it for what it is, and if you want to read a book about true art history, get a nonfiction art history book. And if you want to read about Christian History, get Everett Ferguson's new book on church history, or maybe even Bruce Shelley's \\"Church History in Plain Language.\\"  <br />

B000FGGE68|1.0|Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Messenger) plays Alice...oh I mean Violet, a half human and half vampire fanged fighter of her people. Nick Chinlund (Con Air, Tears of the Sun) plays Daxus, a human with ridiculous noseplugs who wants to destory the race that Jovovich belongs to. Jovovich then helps out a little boy clonse of Daxus named Six played by Cameron Bright (Running Scared, Godsend) who may be a cure to cure Jovovich's fang problem. William Fichtner (Tv's Invasion, Armageddon) also stars as Garth, a friend of Violet's. Kurt Wimmer who directed the much better Equilibrium fails in Ultraviolet resulting in a BOMB and beyond. Jovovich plays the same performance here that she does in the Resident Evil movies which is really annoying. It's too bad you're doing this spit Jovovich...too bad. Fichtner and Chinlund are wasted and Bright plays the same performance like so many of his other films. That kid needs a break. All the acting with the dialouge is dense and the action scenes are pretty weak. Also starring a seriously horrible Sebastien Andrieu (Look at Me).

0792844882|4.0|In 1995, \\"Showgirls\\" was released to a lot of fanfare and acclaim.  Sadly, however, the movie flopped at the box office, but it has gained a sort of cult following in the years since its original release.  As for the movie itself, Elizabeth Berkley of \\"Saved By The Bell\\" fame stars as Nomi Malone, a young girl with no family members (you'll find out why later in the movie) who decided to go to Las Vegas to pursue her dream of becoming a chorus line showgirl.<br /><br />Deciding to hitchhike her way to stardom, she is picked up by a seedy fellow in a pick up truck who tells Nomi that his uncle is a host at the Rivera hotel.  Of course, naive Nomi believes him and much to her chagrin, she finds that he took off with all of her stuff.  However, Nomi's luck changes as Molly Abrams (Gina Rivera) helps Nomi by taking her in.<br /><br />Soon, Nomi finds herself working at the Cheetah club, a topless bar full of rough characters.  However, she manages to catch the attention of two of the customers: Cristal Conners (Gina Gershon) and her boyfriend Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan).  Cristal is the main attraction at a show called \\"Goddess\\" showing at the Stardust hotel.  After a $500 lapdance, Cristal manages to get Nomi an audition for a vacant showgirl position in the show.<br /><br />Nomi secures the part and is soon living her dream, but the rivalry between the somewhat older Cristal and new kid on the block Nomi is just heating up.  Nomi has her sights set on the lead in the show, while Cristal is trying her best to hang onto perhaps her one last time in the spotlight.  Meanwhile, Zack has taken a keen interest in Nomi, and they have a wild make-out session in his pool.  Soon, Nomi is moved up to be Cristal's understudy, but Cristal threatens to leave the show if Nomi becomes the understudy.  This leads to a series of events that leaves Cristal in a hospital bed and Nomi as the center of attraction.  Nomi's friend Molly even fails to escape the series of events.  Will Nomi remain on top, or will she \\"fall\\", just as Cristal did?<br /><br />Despite all of the bad reviews this movie received, it really isn't that bad; in fact, its quite good in spots.  Elizabeth Berkley did nothing to enhance her acting career as Nomi, but Gina Gershon and Kyle MacLachlan are very good as the seductive and controlling Cristal and her puppy dog boyfriend Zack.  The NC-17 version has several rather graphic scenes, so use caution when viewing the film.<br /><br />I recommend this film.  I did enjoy watching it, and the story is actually quite good.  If you like a lot of nudity then this movie is for you.  If you like good acting, then don't bother.Nomi remain on top, or will she \\"fall\\", just as Cristal did? <br /> <br />Despite all of the bad reviews this movie received, it really isn't that bad; in fact, its quite good in spots.

B00004YZFR|5.0|A fantastic behind-the-scenes rockumentary of the Rolling Stones during their peak in the early 70's. Very highly recommended for any Stones Fan. The commentary is fun and the rare live performance clips are great! Go Keef & Co.  <br /> <br />While, in my opinion, \\"Ladies & Gentleman... The Rolling Stones\\" contains the the ultimte concert footage of the Stones during this period of their career - it's not commercially available. This is. Gimmie Shelter is simply the best performance of Glimmer Twins & Company that you can get at your hands on. Buy it today.  <br /> <br />I bought this product from Amazon.com and I suggest that you do the same if you love the Stones and this sort of stuff. Trust me. You will not be disappointed.

It was an exellent story about a family stuggling with Kate's sickness. A family torn in two.. How can they recover from Anna's unwillingness to help her sister? Read to find a beautiful story of sorrows, suffering, and love.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|It's surprising how many mediocre artists sell so many records, and how really interesting artists disappear into obscurity. Linda Perhacs is no exception. Blessed with a beautiful clear voice, a batch of lovely songs and a mind willing to experiment, she has produced a stunning work which has long been lost to the world but thankfully been brought to light again.    The album has a flying start with \\"Chimacum rain\\" which sets the tone for the rest: layers of stunning vocals and a sympathetic & effective backing. \\"Paper mountain man\\" is less unique but still very good, and reminds the listener of Heart. Songs like \\"Dolphin\\", \\"Call of the River\\" and \\"Morning colors\\" especially remind me of Tim Buckley's great Happy/Sad & Blue afternoon period. Least succesful in this great set of songs is \\"Moons and cattails\\", which sounds too contrived & less 'spontaneous' if you will. The title song \\"Parallellograms\\" has surprising lyrics (a lot of mathematical words) and a daring experimental break, which also hints at Tim Buckley's work - the unique and superb \\"Starsailor\\".  For me, winner in this fine collection is \\"Hey, who really cares\\": nothing strange or daring there, but very gentle, melancholic & simply beautiful.    In all this album is head above many works sold by the millions and it deserves a far greater audience. Happily, it seems that Linda Perhacs has decided to enter the world of music again and will produce a new album (only her second since the end of the sixties) by the end of this year. Hopefully this new album (if it is as good as the first one) will cause a more deserving response.
B000002L75|5.0|great album, early music sounds are great to listen too, over and over again.
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Bought the original release and then the re-release with 2 new tracks.  Love the CD but was annoyed that the new tracks weren't on the original.
B000005YZM|4.0|Review no. 77. A superbly / nicely done reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album (isn't it?). Total of 27 tracks,so since the first twelve (12) cuts were the original lp, I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks, wow! That's a lot, for a one-disc release. A fine CD to repeatedly play, plus keep in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come. It's PROBABLY just me, but these tunes should (maybe) be in a different playing order. That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I listen to it. Loads of fabulous / memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here, like \\"Care Of Cell 44\\" (three versions, but welcome), \\"Time Of The Season\\" (stereo and mono versions), the beautifully-done melodic \\"A Rose For Emily\\" (2 versions), \\"I Want Her, She Wants Me\\", \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\" and a cut that I've certainly never heard before, but was quite impressed with it, \\"Butchers Tale\\". Obviously, The Zombies must've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great notice of, until now. Simply, a must-have. Timeless top rate British Invasion rock & roll that'll never truly die.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Woah. That was the only word I can use to describe this movie. It was really amazing, and just... amazing. The images were incredible, and the world was so surreal. I happened to stumble upon this movie in Blockbuster, and upon reading the back cover I grabbed it and went to check it out. I'm glad I did. It's a good movie for teenagers, because it shows a moody teen growing up into a young woman.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Since I am a HUGE fan of Smallville, I just had to come see the movie when it came out. I went to go see it the second day it came out, and it was way better than I could have ever hoped. Some parts of the movie had me in so much suspense I was literally hanging off my chair in anticipation. The characters made the movie seem more real. I was especially surprised with Kate Bosworth. I did not think that she would portray Lois Lane right, but she proved me COMPLETELY wrong. Brandon Routh was fantastic as Superman. At first, I was a little upset to see that Tom Welling was not playing the part, but when I saw the movie, I was so much happier seeing Brandon play the part. You could not wish for a better movie. The actors and director outdid themselves. The music matched all the scenes perfectly, the sound was awesome, and the special effects were fantastic(I can't think of a better word). This is the best movie of the summer, hands down. This is a must see whether you're a Superman fan or not. You'll love it.
B00005MP58|5.0|This production of Pride and Prejudice is absolutely wonderful.  From the casting to the scenery, from the costumes to the acting, it is all great!  So much better than the recent film, which captured none of the nuances of the story.  This DVD set is a must have for fans of the story, of Jane Austen, and of Colin Firth - the perfect Mr. Darcy!!!
B000003493|4.0|Psychadelic? I don't think I'd call most of the tunes on this album psychdelic, save perhaps the great Nazz \\"Open My Eyes\\" and the Dukes' \\"Journey to the Center of Your Mind.\\". But almost every tune here brings back great memories of my childhood, listening to amazing the new music that was coming in the wake of the great British invasion bands.<br /><br />When we think of 60s music, we tend to think of the real monsters of that time, like The Beatles, Cream, Hendrix, the Doors, and so forth, but most of what we listened to was more like what you'd find on this album- great pop tunes recoded by bands with just one or two hits. Listening to this collection will bring back great memories for the over 50 crowd, and show the kids today just how much the current wave of pop owes to those who were performing back when grampa and grandma were tooling around in a VW Microbus.
0385336691|4.0|The newest Jack Reacher story is a good yarn with lots of action moving from New York City to the English countryside.  Reacher is, well, Reacher.  Even though he is getting a bit older, he still has what it takes against almost incredible odds, while still being believable.  And Lee Child gives a nod of encouragement to \\"women of a certain age\\" as the French say, going against the pattern of 40's male with 10 years younger babe. It was a good followup to the last flashback novel.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|a friend made me watch this show.. the whole time i tried to hate it. the premise seemed stupid (a teenage private investigator)to me, but it's a very clever, funny, well written show. it sucks you in emotionally and the mysteries are fun to follow. i'm a fan of arrested development, seinfield, gilmore girls, & six feet under to give you an idea of the different types of humor i would write home about. the pop culture references aren't quite as numerous as the gilmore girls, but i think that is a good thing.  <br /> <br />i agree that the second season is a bit hard to follow, but that's the perfect reason to get the dvd... watch them one after another if you can. in fact, you probably won't be able to stop watching.. it's a great show.
1883217040|3.0|This book is loaded with pretty much all the information a jazz player needs for good improvisation.  The writing is understandable if you have decent knowledge of music and are patient enough to read some parts over more than once.  If you are looking to work on jazz theory, this is probably the right book to start with. <br /> <br />That said, all of the criticisms stated by others are quite valid.  There are so many musical examples (not provided with the book) that they are a little overwhelming.  It is also hard at times exactly what to do with some of the information presented.  If a section was dedicated to helping someone set up their practice sessions, that would be helpful.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is a real new one on me. The music is expertly played and fabulously produced. The talent of all the musicians is clearly evident and the lyrics actually mean something. There are music influences from Pink Floyd, India (odd numbers of beats per measure), early heavy metal and punk rock, plus many others. The bass guitar work is some of the best I've heard in the business. The music is distinctly Tool but sounds very different from their other albums. This one was worth waiting for. BONUS: The CD cover has stereoscopic lenses through which you can look at the booklet. Wow! The 3-D images are really cool!
0634022296|5.0|Very thorough book covering a plethora of Beatles Songs some easy, some not so easy.  The book itself needs to be bound to open and lay flat once you get it as it will not stay open on its own, easy enough done at a print place and worth it.
B000FGGE68|2.0|Imagine taking the acting power of Christian Bale, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs, and Sean Bean (from Equilibrium), and hoping that Milla Jovovich can pull the weight of that ensemble.  You should know that your movie is already in trouble.  Kurt Wimmer's previous pictue, Equlibrium, had great acting, intense scenes, strong drama, all mixed in with creative action scenes.  Ultraviolet drops all those elements except for the creative actions scenes which never seem to end or really have much of a point.  (If you do like this film, check out Versus which is much the same way.)<br /><br />Rumor has it that the director/writer lost final control over this film.  This can been seen in the fact that he contributes nothing to the DVD.  In the making of featurettes, Wimmer is refered to glowingly by the actors, producers, and various crew.  But Wimmer himself is only seen and not heard during the behind the scenes features.  This looks like a case of the production company (Sony) cutting the story out of the film to reduce it to 90 minutes so that it can be non-stop action.  (For other examples of this happening see Fox's Alien VS Predator and X-Men 3.)
B000EMGAOY|5.0|No question the Red Hot Chili Peppers are still \\"Red Hot.\\" This is an incredible double album. And it just gets better with time. I've had it since May 9th and it continues to evolve. I feel sorry for those who just can't manage to wrap their mind around this. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" will probably be the most underrated album of 2006. There will be those claiming there's too much, and those professing that it's not as good as their previous stuff. In my opinion, they're both wrong. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have grown and matured. They put it all on the line with \\"Stadium Arcadium.\\" HUGE risk and well worth it. Let the naysayers have their 15 minutes, then tune into the music and tune out the negativity. You'll be grateful that you did.
B00005JLWN|4.0|The biggest complaint about Equilibrium is that the film is a cliche taken from 1984, Brave New World, and Matrix.  But the movie is an example of using tired cliches and making something fresh.  The action scenes elevate themselves above \\"Matrix clones\\" and are fun and inventive, and the idea of \\"Gun-kata\\" sounds laughable until you see it.  The acting from most of the primaries (Bale, Watson, Diggs, and Bean) elevate this film above standard Hollywood action fare.  If you took out the action, you would still have a very solid and moving film. <br /> <br />Though keep in mind this is also not a light movie by any means.  There are very intense and upsetting moments throughout the film used to create a stronger reality.  But if you are tired of the normal Hollywood rot, this is definitely a film to own.
B000002J2B|5.0|Listening to this again for the first time in over a decade took me back to my college dorm room with the turntable, wine and friends I'm not in touch with any more.  I'm so happy this came out on CD!
B000000W5L|1.0|The Rolling Stones are one of the most lousiest and overrated bands of all time. They only made 2 decent albums in Some Girls, and Tattoo You. This has a few of the lousiest songs in Happy, and Tumbing Dice. Don't buy this horrible album, go get Some Girls insted.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Thank God Tool put out another album.  I don't know whether to be upset that they take so long between releases or to be grateful that every new release is perfect and that they took the time to do it right.  Before I got the album I was almost apprehensive to hear it, worrying it would be bad, but Tool never does the typical thing with their music, and once again, they hit the nail on the head.  10,000 Days is beautiful, more melodic than Lateralus but just as strong.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just Tool fans.
B000002UB3|1.0|I hate the Beatles. I'm so sorry that they never made anything decent because they are a 60's band. Well, the 60's is a really <br />bad decade of music. Abbey Road is a really horrible album with <br />a few of the most horrible tracks in here comes the sun. Don't buy this awful album. go buy any joe walsh, dire straits, foreigner, guns n' roses, green day, or nirvana insted. <br /> <br />and please follow whirligig's recommendations.
1883217040|5.0|This book is very understandable.  It assumes that you have a general understanding of music theory.  From there it takes you through a very clear sequence of concepts specific to jazz.  It's very clear and offers lots of examples and suggestions for practice and approach.  An excellent book.
B000000W5F|3.0|This and some girls have to be the Stones 2 decent albums, because it has two of their greatest songs in 'Start me Up', and Shattered. Buy them both but avoid the new album please. <br />
B00008WT5E|5.0|1978 - what were the options for smart kids? You had garbage popular music (DISCO, not unlike todays awful smattering of terrible boy bandish junk). And you had the greatness of bands like AC-DC, Sabbath, Van Halen etc. Almost 20 years after its release, Powerage still rocks! By this time in their career, Bon Scott and buddies had it down cold - simple but powerful riffs and drinking scowls that only Bon could turn into athems. No filler, just perfect foot stompin' jean jacket blues. Thats the beauty of the Bon Scott era, somehow its simplicity is perfect. This album is timeless. If you don't own it, you need to.
B000002ITM|5.0|Old school thrash metal with a dark, slow groove. Clean sounding vocals well sung by frontman Chuck Billy, Blistering solos ripped with absolute finness and perfection by guitarists Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson, a steady, pounding rythym section from bassist Greg Christian and drummer Louie Clemente. I would love to see this original lineup put out a new recording sometime in the near future.
B000002UTT|5.0|As the decade of the 80's drew to a close one thing was sure, it was a decade defined by its music.  Roxette is one of the great bands that would had had greater success if they had appeared earlier in the decade.  This album contains all that was great about 80's music: great lyrics, a driving beat and you can dance to it.<br /><br />Out of my collection of near 500 CD's, this album is one of the few that I will listen start at track 1 and let it play all 54 minutes.  There just isn't a bad song on the entire CD.<br /><br />Sometimes when you hear a great song on the radio that prompts you to buy the CD, you get one great song and 11 or 12 additional bad songs.  Roxette's \\"The Look\\" was huge radio hit, but unlike other albums the other 12 tracks on the album are just as good as the title track.<br /><br />Just like track 9 says, \\"take your chances\\" and buy a great CD now.
B000002UC5|5.0|\\"Mc Cartney\\" is a classic record. Well it was in record format when I bought it back in 1973.  I wore out two LP's and finally bought the CD.<br />I love \\"Junk\\"  and of course the brillant, \\"Maybe, I'm Amazed\\".<br />If you love music , you have to have this solo effort by Sir Paul.
B000002AHC|5.0|The Byrds, as a working unit, were beginning to disintegrate at the time this album was released; with their main songwriter Gene Clark quitting the band because of the fact that he was terrified of plane-travel, and David Crosby feeling increasingly neglected.  And yet they managed to piece together some of their finest pop music to date, but this time with a little more edge than on their previous albums.      Their main inspiration, it seems, was a healthy competitive streak with their old Liverpudlian sparring partners, and Roger Mcguinn's occasional acid-buddies, The Beatles.  Sgt Peppers fever was everywhere at the time- with everyone from psychedelic jazz artists (David Axelrod) to folkies like The Incredible String Band trying to ride the wave.  And the Byrds were no exeption; they hardly even tried to hide the influence.  I can think of three Sgt Pepperisms off-hand: the Lovely Rita-style heavy breathing in Get to You, the horns that come in near the end of Draft Morning, and then there's the fact that each song segues into the next.  However, the Byrds were always more than mere Beatles wannabes, they were wonderful melody makers too.    The opening track, Artificial Energy, sounds like Beck thirty years before the fact- the driving horns and Mguinn's laid-back vocals make for what is probably the best opener on a Byrds' album.  The rest of the album doesn't disappoint; from Carole King's Goin' Back (try and check out Nils Lofgren's brilliant piano-driven version if you can too) to Space Oddyssey, which continued the Byrds' obsession with alien contact.  It could be said that the latter is some, dipsy, love-child era claptrap, but, writing this review in the year when Neil Young has released a State of the Union address/album called Living With War, I could do with a little more of this kind of music.  What is arguably the best song on the album didn't even make the cut on the original release, which is a very Byrdsian trend (see axed songs like Psychodrama City and She Don't Care About Time).  Triad's basically Crosby asking two lovers to go take part in a menage a trois, and I wouldn't be surprised if they went with it considering he delivered the idea so beautifully.  However, I also think the song is about adopting a free-living, hippie aesthetic, and in that way I think of it as a sort of sister-song to his simliar sounding Almost Cut My Hair, which he released with Crosby, Stills and Nash.    Whether or not this is their best album depends on your tastes.  Personally I'd give that award to Sweetheart of the Rodeo or maybe even Fifth Dimension, but I do know it's a wonderful album of catchy, sometimes inspiring, songs.
0792839730|5.0|`A Bridge Too Far', directed by Richard Attenborough, is a great sprawling war movie in the tradition of the much better classic, Darryl Zanuck's `The Longest Day'. Not only are both movies about a major World War II operation, they are both based on books by the same author, Cornelius Ryan.<br /><br />Part of the problem where one movie succeeds and one fails is that the successful movie is about an allied success and the weaker movie is about an allied failure, but I suspect it goes further than that. Ironicly, I think much of the acting in `A Bridge Too Far' is really superior to that in `The Longest Day'. The Brits such as Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Dirk Bogart, Edward Fox, and Michael Caine are in great form. Some leading Yank actors such as Ryan O'Neal seem weak, especially playing the role of the very dynamic General James Gavin, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. Part of this may be that except for O'Neal, the generally exceptional Gene Hackman and the very photogenic Robert Redford, the Americans are playing lesser roles, as most of the really good stuff involved the British officers of XXX Corp (Armored spearhead of the land attack) and the First Airborne Division which landed at the deepest point of penetration in Arnham.<br /><br />As an old military history wonk, I am really impressed by how accurate everything is in the weapons and tactics used in the film. Every last piece of hardware, from the German light machine guns to the British Firefly versions of Sherman tanks, to the Spitfire doing photoreconnaissance, to the type of breach block on the German anti-tank guns!!!<br /><br />This realism may not have made a big impression when the movie was first released, but set against today's glut of computer generated effects, this `in the flesh' realism, not unlike what we see in even stronger measure in `Saving Private Ryan', is really refreshing, so I suspect this movie may be improving with age.<br /><br />The thing which is so disappointing about the movie is that so little is made of the most interesting aspect of the operation. This is the fact that the Allied commanders were so fixed in their minds of the attractiveness and plausibility of the `Market Garden' plan that they refused to pull up and reconsider their plans when late intelligence showed that the Germans were not as weak in the area as they once were. But then, like `The Longest Day' before it, and like the Cornelius Ryan material behind it, the movie was really all about the characters `on the ground'.<br /><br />As war movies go, this doesn't really have a lot of human drama (even the combat deaths seem to be rather abstract) but it probably tops the list for we grognards who love World War II simulations and tactical and strategic subtlities.<br /><br />This movie has aged very well in the changing fashions of moviemaking.appointing about the movie is that so little is made of the most interesting aspect of the operation.

B00000HYXB|5.0|If the idea of a concept album with roots in J.R.R. Tolkien's dream world turns you off of this album, then ignore all forebodings. Seriously, how much effort does it take to press the \\"skip\\" button on every story-track? A fourth of a calorie? How hard is it to just listen to thirty second's worth of a little tune or speech? There is no excuse, people, for passing up this metal masterpiece. <br /> <br />With some of the almightyist guitar leads known to man and some powerful pipes pushing the lead vocals through the sing-along wall of chorus, it'll take you weeks to pry through this. Seriously, I think I've gotten as far as the final song twice. So why am I writing this review now? I probably shouldn't, but I don't care, bug off.  <br /> <br />ANYWAY, how about some standout tracks? The first musical track (number two) starts off pretty lame, I thought I had made a mistake at that point. When the chorus and kick drums pop in, though, you start moving a bit, and listening to the slicing leads going into the second stanza is a heavily head-banging moment. \\"Nightfall,\\" \\"The Curse of Feanor,\\" \\"Blood Tears,\\" \\"Noldor...,\\" \\"Time Stands Still...,\\" \\"Thorn,\\" \\"The Eldar,\\" \\"When Sorrow Sang,\\" and presumably the last track. If it sounds like I just read you a track list...pretty much. Just a really kickin' album. One or two complaints; sometimes you have to strain to notice the *rhythm* guitar, let alone the bass; you don't even know that exists until the shell opens up in \\"When Sorrow Sang.\\" <br /> <br />So grab this album. NOW. I promise you you'll love it eventually. If not, your money back. From the store. I'm not giving you a cent, chump.
B000FA57RG|5.0|Madonna, the Queen of all music, shows us all how a live album is done!  Her performances of \\"Vogue,\\" \\"American Life,\\" and \\"Into the Groove\\" are all fabulous!  Madonna is way way WAY better than any classic rock act, and they can only WISH they can come up with a live album as brilliant as this.  We love you, Madonna!!
B0000507R0|4.0|The best record of ELP in a new 5.1 version.<br /><br />Sadly the new version uses a different version of JERUSALEM and TOCCATA bat this is not printed on the cover (there is a new vocal line in first middle of jerusalem and some synths in TOCCATA are different; in the beginning the synth is missing so that the musical line is ruined).<br /><br />A very good release in the rest of the record.<br /><br />I prefer the original version but is a good release.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the most gorgeous organised chaos and compelling music I've ever suffered in my life. When I first experienced this work I felt completely abandoned and ironically this album saved my brain from inertia. <br /> <br />The musical context helps to lay a solid foundation for exploring the complex human mind. This is mellow, uplifting, dense, wonderful, frail, angular, violent, edgy, complicated, anthemic, magnificent, endless, clever and lively. <br /> <br />This musical book tells a story: an awareness of technology. A genuine, intelligent and frightening exploration of alienating, hybrid computer world at its finest. The undeniable greatness of the music soundtrack makes the rest.This is the album that left their counterparts struggling in the dust.  <br /> <br />By far the most powerful and unparalleled album in music's history. Nothing you could say would ever make a difference <br /> <br />hold your breath  <br />

B000FMGTTE|5.0|This is by far the best movie soundtrack I have bought yet.  All tracks are very enjoyable to listen to.  Keeping John Williams score on this movie was one of the best decisions they made at getting Superman back on the Big Screen. You can hear touches of his original music score throughout the CD.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This film was awesome. It had great acting and a great plot. I love X-men and I have the 1st and 2nd movies and when the third comes out I will have it. I would recommend to anyone

The costumes are fantastic, a true sparkling moment for hollywood.  They don't make films like this one anymore.  I am not usually a fan of musicals but this one is a definate pleasure to watch.  enjoy
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Yesterday I had a sudden craving for a classic movie. I didn't know where the urge came from, or how long it would last, so I figured that I should choose a very special movie just in case it vanished as quickly as it came.  Fortunately for me, I chose Breakfast at Tiffany's, and now I think I'll go hunting for more of the same.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Holly Golightly (a radiant Audrey Hepburn) is an unconventional young woman who lives life on the edge on Manhattan's Upper East Side.  She's very impulsive and money-oriented, and spends her evenings flirting with older male acquaintances upon whose generosity she survives and thrives.  Her favorite place in the world is Tiffany's, the famous jewellery store that calms her down on \\"mean red\\" days. Her erratic behavior irritates her upstairs neighbor, an unfortunately cast Mickey Rooney, who's as Japanese as American Pie, and quite offensive as a stereotype.  She's also friendly with an imprisoned mob boss named Sally Tomato whom she visits weekly and talks about the weather.<br /><br />When a struggling writer (George Peppard) moves into the building, she instantly recognizes him as a kindred spirit, especially when she learns that he also accepts money from the opposite sex for services rendered.  Finding in him a sympathetic ear, a sounding board and willing accomplice all in one, the two become friends through good times and bad, even when her husband Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen) shows up with an ultimatum of his own.  Male friends come and go, and bad luck seems to follow her around, but Holly bears it all in style with a gorgeous wardrobe, an unsinkable attitude, a long cigarette holder and plenty of booze for back-up.<br /><br />A classic movie deserves an award winning soundtrack, and this movie has one mega-famous signature song.  Audrey Hepburn may not have the best singing voice on the world, but when she sings Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\" you'll find yourself singing along too.<br /><br />Like Tiffany's, this movie is another sure-fire cure for the mean reds.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 29, 2006Tiffany's, this movie is another sure-fire cure for the mean reds. <br /> <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, June 29, 2006
1841157910|4.0|I'll make this short and sweet. <br />First off the book is an insight into the world of pure mathematics, it uses the fulcrum of the Last Theorem (an apparently very simple rule) to touch upon a number of different issues within both the practice and history of the subject. <br />Second. This book is interesting! It contains almost no technical material (aside from the optional appendices), and pure mathematics is surprisingly fascinating; not being a number theorist i appreciated the many references it has to the practical implications of maths, but there are also some noodle-baking moments concerning ideas that are so very simple, yet totally strange. <br />Third. Fairly quick to read. <br />Fourth. Tells the story of one of the most important breakthroughs of the twentieth century. <br />Hope this was useful
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Talk about a CD that's gonna get played. This one has several great songs. It's fun, smart, and generally well done. The Cover of The Violent Femmes Gone Daddy Gone is cool and crazy is just a wonderful pop song. Order Yours NOW !!!
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is such a nice collection of The Earth, Wind & Fire's hits. Most of the songs on here topped the R&B charts, and this collection includes their #1 hits. My favorites songs are \\"September,\\" \\"Sing a Song,\\" \\"Reasons,\\" \\"Let's Groove,\\" and \\"After The Love Has Gone.\\" I recommend this cd to people who like 70's R&B.
B00005N83M|3.0|There are some songs that are actually pretty good, \\"I'm Gonna Be Algrght\\", \\"Play\\", \\"Love Don't Cot A Thing\\", \\"Ain't It Funny\\", \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\" and \\"I'm Real\\". I really like this songs, but I have to admit that the rest of the CD just sucks. But I didn't buy this CD, I borrowed it from a friend, and I don't regret, because I don't think I would have enjoyed it after 20 times...If you can, borrow it, don't buy it.
B00005JOVH|5.0|Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background. <br />X-Men-The Last Stand picks up where the second movie, X2-X-Men, left off, with the government having found a cure for the mutations.  Will this revelation finally bring peace or will full-out war break out? <br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn (three of the most GORGEOUS women out there!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world! <br />My only question is what happened to Kurt Wagner from X2-X-Men?  He was great! <br />In short, X-Men-The Last Stand is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!! <br />

B00024769C|5.0|Easy Rider is a movie that defined an Era, and more over brought closour to it, the disturbing ending left audiences wondering what Fonda and Hopper were trying to say, regardless of how you interpret it, it's a strong film. The mythical Billy and Wyatt riding into the sunset through the desert on their choppers, reminding us of the outlaws that once road through the very same land on their horses, as though Billy and Wyatt are outlaws themselves, in a sense. No matter how you cut it, this movie is powerful, regardless of which side of the spectrum your looking from.

B00005JOQS|2.0|A title card displays telling us that Superman came to Earth to protect the world and serve justice, but then inexplicably left us.  We are then given the famous John Williams score from 1978 and even the cool blue credits (if you've never seen them, you are missing history, people!).  And then the movie begins with a bizarre scene where Lex Luthor steals a dying widow's fortune, Luthor then returns to the Fortress of Solitude (Superman's hideout in the Arctic), and then Superman crash-lands in a spaceship to Smallville outisde of Martha Kent's home.  What in the blue hell (forgive the pun) is going on here?  Fortune-stealing, hideout invasion, an invincible hero with flying powers crashing in a spacecraft?  Such events are not the traditional \\"Superman\\" happenings.  The movie goes downfill from there. <br /> <br />We learn that Superman left Earth to visit Krypton and...um, visit Krypton to...oh wait, he left Earth simply because the plot demanded some character developments that wouldn't have happened otherwise.  Okay, let me get to the bottom of this.  Lex Luthor, Superman's most notorious adversary, is trying to kill Superman basically to kill Superman.  No surprise there, however there is a logical if laughable reason that Luthor still roams the Earth freely - Superman missed his court appearance!  Lois Lane, the feisty hard-edged reporter of the Daily Planet and closest correspondent to the Man of Steel, has a son and is engaged to the editor's nephew.  Interesting idea, and a few good scenes, but what ultimately develops out of that idea is a melodramatic love triangle that goes on and on and begs for our sympathy and our tears as if we were watching \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"Before Sunset\\".  What about Superman, or his alter ego Clark Kent?  Again, why did he leave Earth for five years?  What compelled him to return?  Why was he in a spacecraft?  Clark Kent is still that charming goof who conveniently shows up when Superman does.  Do people STILL NOT see behind theglasses or notice the coincidenes?  As for Superman, he's one cool-looking hero who returns in awesome fashion, but then just does his usual thing.  More on the Man of Steel, later. <br /> <br />The key to a great superhero film, in most cases, is a great villain.  Kevin Spacey portrays Lex Luthor as a greedy intellect who has no problem with destroying parts of the world so that his real estate value will begin and grow into a fortune.  Sound like a good idea?  It does, but it also did so back in 1978 when Lex Luthor had the same exact idea - cause destruction so that real estate empire begins.  But I really am too harsh, because in 1978 it was nuclear missiles that would do the damage, whereas in 2006 it's Kryptonian crystals from the Fortress of Solitude.  What's equally disappointing is that Luthor and Superman barely share any screen time together (I counted two very short scenes). <br /> <br />Okay, so the character developemtns and romantic interest and villain conflict are all out.  But every superhero movie has some exciting action, right?  This \\"Superman Returns\\" does very well.  There is an exciting plane-crash save, some Superman errands (stop robbers, prevent civilian harm), and a bizarre land-mass removal (don't ask).  But there is very little Superman action, so the main appeal of watching most superhero movies is totally thrown out the window. <br /> <br />Part of a superhero film is showing the splendor and imagination of using one's powers for good, or the struggle to remain selfless when using them, or the loss of will to use them at all.  There are an infinite number of themes that can be used to portray a superhero.  What \\"Superman Returns\\" chose to do with the Man of Steel is vaguely explain why he quit, show briefly why the world is in awe of his return, and then let him do a couple of neat tricks.  Throw in the aforementioned love triangle into the mix, plus that sweet-faced kid who carries unbelieveable secrets I dare not reveal, and we have one hell of a mess here. <br /> <br />I've come to believe that making a good \\"Superman\\" movie is one tough task.  Think about it: he's an invincible hero with a weakness for radioactive pieces that only the most knowledgable villain could even have a chance of finding.  Because he has few physical weaknesses, then the only way to show depth is explore his emotional levels.  Because this movie doesn't show much heart through its characters, then we basically have a slow-paced action flick with some good-looking scenes. <br /> <br />The first movie from 1978 was the setup for the Man of Steel.  The second film showed Superman's toughest challenge yet - three Krypton villains.  \\"Lois and Clark\\" addressed the romantic complications of Superman and the woman he loves most.  \\"Smallville\\" is showing Clark Kent's growth from a teenager into a young man, learning to embrace his identity.  All of those movies/shows are terrific!  It saddens me to say this, but maybe the character of Superman has been completely exhausted.

B0001IMD2Y|4.0|I like this movie more and more each time I watch it. Yes, the first time I saw it at the theater I was kind of let down because I had expectations of it topping Terminator 2. It doesn't do that, but it really is an interesting movie. The effects definitely top T2. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's not a stinker either. If you have never seen it, just go into it knowing it will not surpass T2 as far as acting and storyline, and you should enjoy it.

I recommend this book to everyone that is contemplating marriage or that has been married, but having difficulty with an expression of love to/from their mate.

B0002DB52M|5.0|Lars Von Trier discovered a new way to make great films.It is an easy and very believable method.Forget that big sets you have seen in LORDS Of THE RINGS and other huge scales like those in GLADIATOR and TROY.It is an elegant/clever new film without CGI or big action scenes otherwise there is simple sets (like those you can see in plays),great performances(Beatany and Caan shines),a very good narrator(ALIEN,s John Hurt), a flixeble camera movement and an excelant writer/director. A must for the stars, fans and for those who can not live without films as I am.
0312263120|2.0|I just wanted to say that this is the first Dan Brown book that I have read and might possibly be the last. The book starts out with a lot of potential. We learn things little by little, and our interests get peaked. As a good mystery, we are led in several different directions. But unfortunately the book ends terribly with even some groaners. The problem is that I had guessed before hand most of the plot twists by half the book and screaming the answers at the end. It made me feel like I was on top of my game but it really was just a trick. He made it too easy to figure it out, I realized that I am not that smart. He made it easy so I could feel good about myself, to make me feel as smart as the cryptographers in the book. I was duped. Either he is patronizing me or just not that good of a writer. I want to feel a little stupid when I read a book, I want to say to myself that there is no possible way in hell that I can write that well or have that creative of an imagination. Did anyone get the feeling that the end had a very Hollywood Bruckheimer movie type ending with explosions of fireballs and impending doom down to the very last seconds? I really did have a great start but it sure went downhill fast, too bad.

0099456761|5.0|In the second chapter of this book (actually labelled as \\"3\\" because this is the second prime number), we are introduced to Christopher, the narrator, who is writing a mystery novel as a class project. Christopher is an extremely intelligent 15-year old who just happens to be autistic. He begins his tale by relating his discovery of a neighbor's dog, which had been murdered with a garden fork. Because he likes both dogs and mysteries, Christopher sets off to find the killer, but what starts as a story about a dog becomes a story about Christopher's life. Not only do we learn about Christopher's many quirks, but also we learn the explanations for his seemingly irrational behavior, making it seem almost logical. The book is surprising funny, as Christopher, with his limited emotional range, makes the perfect straight man. As a psychologist, I found that the depiction of Christopher rang true, and overall, I found this novel to be a delightful, different, and quick little read.

1428800271|5.0|Unlike many pop psychology books, the insights in Flow can be readily applied to genuinely enhance any life. While the style is marred by excessive political correctness (such as changing the gender of pronouns every other paragraph) it is an easy read. Greater reference to the author's research and less to his personal philosophy would, in my opinion, have made the work stronger. Still, the book is filled with many useful insights.
B000E6ESL2|2.0|Many people quite understandably dismiss `Stay' as confusing, incoherent mess that pretends to be a supernatural or psychological thriller. On the other hand there are people who defend the film, saying that the disappointed audiences are actually misinformed about the content of the film, which should be promoted as something other than thriller.  <br /> <br />Which side is right after all? It is a tantalizing question, and you will never know it, but at least it is true that `Stay' shares elements commonly found in recent thrillers that benefit from the spooky, supernatural elements (whatever they are). If Ewan McGregor plays a psychiatrist in New York, and finds his new patient Henry (Ryan Gosling) can predict the change of the weather, it is definitely a thriller. Not only that; Henry declares he is going to die in three days; Henry insists that a blind chess player (Bob Hoskins) is actually his father. So who is Henry, or where are we now?  <br /> <br />Frankly, some of us do not care, and I am among them. The greatest problem of the film is, for all the intriguing and mesmerizing tricks of visuals and editing, the film gets boring soon. Now don't get me wrong here before you dismiss my review, for I know some thrillers do not necessarily needs a single, definite answer. Thrillers can be open to multiple interpretations, and they can be still good thrillers. But `Stay' is not one of them, throwing in clues, visual or verbal, all of which just create confusion, the simplest confusion that refuses to stimulate our brains. <br /> <br />Many people say that 'Stay's is confusing, but here is the real reason for our complaint about the confusion in `Stay.' - it is boring. Now take a look at another kind of confusion, which is also mind-boggling but more intriguing than this one. Yes, another Naomi Watts `thriller' `Mullholand Dr.' which is more challenging, audacious, even ridiculous, but still more fascinating than `Stay.' I know it is not fair to compare Mark Forster with David Lynch, for no one can think like the latter, but at least the nightmarish feeling of `Stay' could have been developed into something more other-worldly (like the Hollywood of Lynch's own vision). But Forster even does not explore that direction, stopping in the realm of pretty conventional supernatural thrillers. <br /> <br />I am truly disappointed with the film because it is exceptionally well-acted. McGregor shows the depth of the character while Naomi Watts, despite her underwritten role, brings certain amount of warmth and humanity into the film's world, which should be less about the rather flashy camera and more about Henry and his world itself.

B00005JOQS|4.0|\\"You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but, everyday I hear people crying for one.\\"   - The Man Of Steel tells (on again, off again girlfriend) Lois Lane one of the many reasons why \\"Superman Returns\\"     Twenty-five summers after the release of \\"Superman II\\" & another roughly ten to fifteen years trying to get the project off the ground, Superman finally makes the leap back to the big screen in the aptly titled \\"Superman Returns\\". The results are mixed (I actually give the film ***1/2 stars).    After the events of \\"Superman II\\", \\"Superman Returns\\" starts off with the Man Of Steel returning to Earth after a five year absence. It looked like astronmers had found the remains of what looked to be the burnt out planet of Krypton, Supes' his homeworld & Kal-El had to find out if anyone was home. Finding out that he truly is the last of his people, Superman returns to his real home, Earth.    As for Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, he's free after Superman fails to show up for his parole hearing.    \\"How much do you think that pisses off Superman?\\", asks Jimmy Olsen.    \\"A lot.\\", replies an unamused Clark Kent, stunned by the news.     Lex is also back in the green after swindling an inheritance from a millionairess, early on in the film.    In the wake of Superman's mysterious dissapearance, the people of Metropolis realize that maybe they don't need a Superman afterall. That's the big question that Big Blue has to face. Will people accept his return? Do they really need him?     Things don't actually look up for Clark Kent on his return to \\"The Daily Planet\\". Sure, he got his old job back, but, it's a one two punch that sends him to the local bar, in search of a drink, after finding out that Lois Lane has written a Pulitzer Prize winning essay on why the world doesn't need Superman, has moved on with her life with her five year old son & is engaged to Richard White, Perry's nephew, associate editor to \\"The Daily Planet\\", & father (?) to Lois' son.  It's atthe local sports bar, having a beer with Jimmy Olsen (the only one that seems happy to see him back), & a dangerous mishap with a NASA space shuttle, that Clark Kent makes up his mind to bring Superman back into the public eye.    While most of the people of Earth embrace the return of Superman, two people aren't happy to see his arrival.     Lois Lane, originally, heartbroken & now, angry has quite a few questions for her former boyfriend.    As for Lex Luthor, he's making a huge land grab that will sink most of America underwater, thanks to some Kryptonian crystals pilfered from Superman's Fortress Of Solitude & Kryptonite stolen from a local museum.    Of course, it's not a Superman film without Lois getting into trouble & all hell breaking loose thereafter. After some snooping around, trying to find out the cause of a mysterious citywide blackout, Lois, with her son in tow, accidently lands on a yacht that belongs to a freshly showered millonaire.    \\"Lex Luthor.\\"  \\"Lois Lane?!\\"  \\"Your bald.\\"     It's up to Superman to save Lois, her son (who may or might not have the White family blood running through him), & the U.S. of A from Lex Luthor's \\"Century 21\\" making disaster.    \\"Superman Returns\\" is one of those films that should be epic & fun, but, comes off big & by the numbers. I expected a lot more from director, Bryan Singer. There are quite a few loopholes to the film. \\"Returns\\" can't hold a match to the first two \\"Superman\\" films (those are still tops).     \\"Superman Returns\\"' main & ultimately crippling problem is that it lacks the charm, warmth, & humor of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" & \\"Superman II\\" & this problem spreads throughout the film's lead charcter's. The chemistry between Lois & Superman is practically non-existent (they don't even kiss for God's sake!), & the big battle between Lex & Supes is lame & could be akin to a New York gang mugging.     Brandon Routh does a passable job in the title role, but, in some scenes it seems as if Routh is doing an empty impression of Reeve. The classic Superman flyby that ends each \\"Super\\" film is mechanically done here. Oddly, of all the character's in the film Superman gets the least lines. The scenes where Superman secretly looks in on Lois & her family, & the scene where he watches, what might be his own son, sleeping are actually, & I hate to say it, a bit creepy.    Kate Bosworth is too young to be playing Lois Lane. Her Lane is more of a smoking, soccer mom than a hard-nosed reporter. The thin plotline of Lois' son possibly being Superman's is just ludicrous. Remember, Superman gave up his powers in \\"II\\" in order to be with Lois. Only after learning about the Phantom Zone criminals taking over the world, did Supes go back & retrieve his super powers.    Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is one of the saving graces of \\"Superman Returns\\" (the action scenes are the other saving grace). His Luthor is more inline with Gene Hackman's portrayal than Spacey admits. However, Spacey doesn't bring that sense of menace that both Hackman & Michael Rosenbaum (Luthor in \\"Smallville\\") to their roles.  The scene where Luthor discovers Lois & her son aboard his yacht & the scene on the island near film's end are priceless. Parker Posey is dissmissable as Kitty (Posey was better as Gail Weathers in \\"Scream 3\\"). Valerie Perrine's, Miss Teschmacher & Ned Beatty's, bumbling Otis are sorely missed.    The action scenes are pretty much what makes \\"Superman Returns\\" worth watching, especially the shuttle/airplane sequence.     Superman's return is a welcome one but it's not an epic one.    \\"Superman Returns\\" flies home on DVD on November 28, 2006. Two editions will be available both in the 2.40:1 film aspect ratio. The first is either wide or full screen & contains just the film. The 2 disc edition has \\"Requiem For Krypton\\" - a 3 hr. doc on the making of \\"Superman Returns\\" & other features.

Yes, even better than the original which was shot in a very unprofessional manner. <br /> <br />Don't tell me... I know, it was an extremely small budget. But even for a movie that about to head into the 70's it was poorly shot. There are older movies that look better. <br /> <br />Don't pay attention to the last woman. This is indeed a classic. She has this at 3 stars but a Freddy movie at 5... She must  consider Freddy 3 a classic. C'mon now. Get real. <br /> <br />Always make sure to check other peoples reviews. If they have a bunch of movies where they give retarded reasoning and ratings for mediocre movies you know they're full of crap. <br /> <br />I like Freddy...

B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie was really shocking. While I was watching it in the theatre I had my hand over my mouth the entire time and several times I wanted to get up and leave. What makes this movie scary is the fact that it deals with the devil which is something that many of us beieve exists and it can't get any more 'in your face' than having a demon in you. You definetly want to see this but honestly, I wouldn't watch it alone.

I think I might have found her!  This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult and I found her book easy to read, and wanting to read and not put the book down. The subject matter was very relevant to me.   As a registered nurse I found many of the details concerning health care and the emotions that occur from both the ill and those that are the loved ones taking care of the ill very realistic.   The way she writes in a way that makes you get into the characters head.  I also enjoyed the fact that the lives of the characaters are entertwined.  I recommend this book.
0143034901|5.0|One of the BEST books I have ever read in my life.  The story just drew me in and wouldn't let go. I could not put it down. I'm actually thinking of going back to school and learning Spanish so that I could read all his other novels since no others have been translated into English yet.  Hopefully that will change.  Warning: do not start this book unless you have at least two or three hours to devote to it!  It is NOT a piecemeal book.  The story draws you right in and you feel as though you are part of the pages of this magnificent novel. This is one book that I will definitely reread in the future.
B0009WFFS6|2.0|Jack is obviously not well. Ginger's kit sounds like an 80's pop band and Eric should just throw away that awful sounding Strat. <br />Ok we can't have a replica I know. <br />Eric's choice of notes is just not as good as it used to be. He was way more adventurous back in the day. <br />No more of the lyrical phrasing, the calm excitement and melodies under extreme pressure. All gone and replaced with just going through the motions. <br />I hope Jack and Ginger make a buck out of it. They certainly deserve it. <br /> <br />The music died the day Clapton picked up a Stratocaster. He never really bonded with it. <br />Anyway it looks like a lounge band playing covers. Very polite and laidback and nothing new to say.

The care they lavish over the chorus<br /><br />  Who is the gaucho amigo<br /><br />  Why is he standing<br /><br />  In your spangled leather poncho<br /><br />  And your elevator shoes<br /><br />makes you burst out laughing. Recorded in seven studios with an early primitive digital sequencer, \\"Gaucho\\" proves that the abject failure of recent records to sound great isn't due to digital artefacts, or modern recording techniques, but a lack of will and skill.  I listen to it on cameraphone, average PC speakers, and hella-expensive stereo, and it's gorgeous on anything.

B000006U44|5.0|This CD is as good today as it was in 1978.. I first heard it in Denmark and have thought of it often.. It was so nice to go to amazon and find that I was able to purchase it.  Thank you
6305428298|5.0|I saw this in the theater and am on my way to add the DVD to my wish list because it's a GREAT film.  Brenda Blethyn, Michael Caine, Jane Horrocks and Jim Broadbent are all amazing in it, and I agree with an earlier review which mentions Michael Caine's Oscar-worthy performance.  He's unforgettable in this role.  All three actors embodied other people completely in this movie, plus the story is touching and sad and then hopeful at the same time.  Talent, talent, talent, and a powerful story.
B00001OH80|4.0|I feel that Bowie changes with every new album so I always go in listening to Bowie with open ears, not prejudice.  This is a fine album.  I think that Bowie was trying to go for a more latin sound than Let's Dance.  The title track is disposable, but it's the only one.  I liked this album, maybe it's because I am a Bowie fan, but give this album a chance, you may like it.
0451196716|4.0|The Long Walk was an interesting book, with Stephen King's usual keen insight into the minds and motivations of teenaged boys. The story was fascinating and disturbing, with plenty of surprises.  While not his best work, I recommend it if you're a King fan.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Had seen this movie several times prior to buying it.  It's a classic, and I wanted it in my library.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Just want to say that this is a great album. Pink Floyd style, meaningful lyrics, and melody & music that you enjoy. Its more than that, since it was written in and about an island in the mediterranean, it gives you the sence and feeling of the warmth, culture and the atmosphere of the place. David with Polly gives also a sense of romance, love and thankfullness to the things they have and to enjoy each day of life. <br />Well done. Pink floyd and David Gilmour fans should enjoy this album.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|I have watched this film 3 times but never fail laughter. Grant and Hepburn were at their best. the extras were great too. a complete introduction for both Grant and Hawks offers a lot of valuable information and episodes about other famous films.<br /><br />excellent movie and DVD.
B0009P42S2|2.0|Like many others, Akira was my first viewing of anime' (then, \\"Vampire Hunter D\\"), so when I heard this movie was done by Otomo (\\"Akira\\"), I entered the viewing with high expectations.  I was let down.  The animation flows well, but is rather bland. Unlike most anime', which is futuristic (even post-apocalyptic), this story is based around the turn-of-the century 1900.  Steam was the main form of power for many engines, and engineers were working on newer & better forms of steam technology.  How lame is it to have the main character's family name be \\"Steam\\"?<br /><br />There are some interesting concepts in the story, but over all, it's a snooze-fest for most anime' fans.  Akira this is not.  Rent the movie before you decide to buy it (unless you find it on clearance for $3 like my husband did...at least that was cheaper than a rental fee).<br /><br />I think the other \\"in depth\\" reviews go over all the important points- my review is just a simple way of saying that this movie is quite a let-down. The very end of the movie is the only thing that salvages it and I give it two stars instead of one.  The end is an unexpected twist on what the grandfather had planned the steam-balls for.  That, and watching the snotty-little-girl's dream house in England go Ka-BOOM! are the best parts of the movie (you'll have to watch the movie to understand that part, so I don't think it's a spoiler).  JMHO.<br /><br />MeOw!<br /><br />>^..^&lt;

006441034X|5.0|I stumbled on Diana Wynne Jones by way of her Chrestomanci Chronicles, and really, I think this book was much better! It was a magical tale about Sophie, a girl with so much to offer but because of her poor self-image and an ecounter with a witch, becomes a cursed old lady. Sophie thinks that the terrible wizard Howl might be able to help her break the curse, and even though she is fearful of him, she figured he wouldn't prey on her since she is such an old lady.<br /><br />I'm afraid I haven't done the book justice with my poor summary of the plot, but the book is enchanting - both because the plot is exciting, but also because Diana has a great storytelling voice and her ideas are very fresh (even thhough they are over a decade old.)Most of all, her characters are laughably funny, especially Howl himself. I love it that he expresses himself in slime!<br /><br />I have yet to see the movie, so I don't know how the book compares. I can't imagine that the movie could be as good... there's just so much that a movie couldn't capture properly, but I'll reserve judgement until I actually see it. This is a must for lovers of innocent fantasy.

0062502182|1.0|I began this book looking for a fast, short read and hoping that they hype was true - the book offered a fascinating insight to the reader. At first, I was pleased with the simple writing - it read like a bed time story - I looked forward to the culmination of the almost rambling tale.  By 100 pages in, I no longer cared if this book held the secret to life - it was BORING!!!!  The quaint, simplistic style became insultingly childlike and the rambling became a chaotic assortment of characters who in themselves were uninteresting and almost annoying.  I shelved a lousey 160 page book without finishing it and I have no qualms about it.  All this book did for me was to make me tired of the entire notion of the meaning of life and sick of characters who are too ignorant to find a happy path through life without it being spelled out for them by total strangers.  Save your money.
0553801503|2.0|The book drags on in a plodding style reminiscent of the later works of Robert Jordan. Many chapters are full of filler material, one small example being the constant need to list the heraldry of every single individual regardless of their importance or relevance to the situation. I found myself skimming through many paragraphs trying to find some pertinent information. 1 star for content, 1 star for previous merit.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Let's get past One More Time, the hit. Let's get past the Pitchfork review, which was mediocre. Let's get past the fact that you don't generally like animes (me neither).  This is a movie that will have you uplifted and exuberant. Set aside your cynism, oh dear and critical friends; this is a must-have. Set to the music of \\"Discovery\\", Leiji Matsumoto animated a masterpiece. There are no words (besides the \\"Discovery\\" songs), but the brilliance in animation is emoting purely through image. The album by itself was incredibly dancable, but once the context of the whole story is set out by video, it is irresistable and unforgettable. To the wannabes: this will make you look damn cool. To the jaded hipsters: if you don't own thsi already, you may be setting yourself up for loss of street cred. To the average music consumer: if this doesn't get you dancing, you need Viagra.
B000EULJLU|5.0|What's the big controversy? If you like Tool, if you like AENIMA and LATERALUS, there's no good reason not to like this album. In typical Tool fashion, these songs are heavy and dense with plenty of complicated time signatures and extended segments of trippy atmosphere. If anything, Tool haven't changed the formula enough. I really dig the tracks currently getting radio attention (mostly \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"The Pot\\") even though they practically sound like conventional, run-of-the-mill Tool. Still, this isn't really a problem for me since I love Tool and no one else sounds like them.<br /><br />Maynard referred to 10,000 DAYS as their \\"blues album.\\" Whatever. I do sympathize with those who find Maynard annoying because I do think he can be extremely pretentious at times, but I have no trouble seperating the musicians from the music itself. Adam Jones lays down some killer guitar passages that do approach mainstream rock in some ways (some passages even smack of Godsmack), but I don't hear anything that makes me think of \\"blues,\\" not in terms of the musical style at least.<br /><br />For well over a decade now, there's been a lot of pressure on bands to completely reinvent themselves with each new album or else they get labeled as being sterile or simply treading water. This isn't always fair. A great band doesn't need to reinvent the freaking wheel every time out in order to make great, compelling music.<br /><br />Regardless of how you label or dissect this album, this is solid Tool music. If you like Tool, you should at least like this album, although I would think it more likely that the average fan would go crazy over it. It's not exactly a ground breaker as far as Tool is concerned, but it's definitely an update, a refinement of Tool's music and a most worthy addition to their discography.
0767827791|2.0|Rebecca: This is so bad it's almost good.     Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.     \\"Picnic\\" is hardly the only example of Joshua Logan's limitations as a director. Logan's small body of directing work is highlighted by two of the worst screen adaptations of good Broadway musicals ever produced: \\"Paint Your Wagon\\"and \\"Camelot\\". His \\"South Pacific\\" was a happy exception. After doing some second unit directing on \\"Mister Roberts\\" he was turned loose to direct the sequel \\"Ensign Pulver\\"; a compare and contrast of the two films provides a nice illustration of Logan's talent limitations.     That said he was badly served by Daniel Taradash's adaptation of the William Inge novel. Inge's subtle nuanced story is turned into a something midway between \\"A Place In the Sun\\" and \\"State Fair\\". In the adaptation 19-year old small town beauty Marge (Kim Novak) is crowned Queen of Neewollah (Halloween spelled backward), the highlight of her town's annual Labor Day picnic.     Marge spends most of her time complaining about wanting more from a man than just being looked at because she is pretty. Enter Hal Carter (William Holden), a moronic but pretty drifter who comes through the town for one day. Marge takes some time off from complaining about being looked at to look at Hal because he is pretty. And when Hal is not busy being a moron or talking about himself he looks at Marge because she is pretty. Since this is all he does he must have made Marge rethink her need for anything more than a man who looks at her because she is pretty.     There are a few secondary story lines. Marge's sister Millie (Susan Strasberg) spends her time complaining because she's not pretty enough for men to look at her. Old-maid schoolteacher Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) spends her time complaining because she is no longer pretty enough for men to look at her. Alan (Cliff Robertson), one of the men who has been looking at Marge, spends his time complaining that Marge prefers being looked at by Hal. Howard (Arthur O'Connell) complains that he can't do anything more than look at Marge.     This is pretty much the whole story although there is also a documentary feature edited into the middle of the film that features tons of stuff you would find at a small town picnic; like pie- eating contests, sack races, concerts, jam and jelly judging, crying babies-laughing babies- frowning babies, and surreptitious drinking.     Ironically while \\"Picnic\\" is Holden's all-time worst acting performance, his propensity to take off all or part of his shirt is the main reason for the film's popularity with certain viewers who like that sort of thing. Holden could believably play anti-heros (see \\"Stalag 17\\" and \\"Sunset Blvd\\") but not dumb ones and Hal's most prominent character trait is stupidity.     Novak (as in all her straight dramatic roles) looks scared about having a camera pointed in her direction-she eventually learned to do comedy pretty well but in \\"Picnic\\" comedy is in short supply. Novak also does not benefit from having a lot of scenes with Strasberg, who was not just a real actress but was such a physical opposite that there is not even a hint of a sisterly dynamic.     Robertson is actually very good, managing to make most of his terribly lame dialogue work. And the TCM version is a restored wide-screen print which nicely showcases the film's strengths; editing and production design.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I bought this dvd for a mid 70's Stanford Graduate, who actually dropped everything she was doing to watch the entire feature without a break.  She really loved the movie and didn't fall asleep watching it as she does other films.  This is a gem of a movie that career gals of today would find unbelivable.
B00000612P|5.0|Although Rod Stewart had been on the British blues scene since 1965, most notably as vocalist with the Jeff Beck group from 1968-1970, he was still relatively unknown. It wasn't until the reformation of the Faces in 1970, when they were joined by Ronnie Wood, also from the Jeff Beck group, that Stewart finally found his niche. With the making of EPTAS, a classic album was born and with the release of 'Maggie May' as a single, Rod Stewart became a household name.<br /><br />This album still sounds wonderful today as it did way back in 1971. In those days, Rod genuinely cared about his material, and injected fiery passion and raw emotion into his singing, with his unique vocals. There are no duff tracks or fillers on here. All tracks are of a remarkably high standard, and it isn't just Rod that makes this album so good to listen to, apart from arguably writing 3 of the best songs on it, but Ronnie Wood's contribution is almost as important. His playing whether on rhythm, lead or slide guitar complements Rod's hoarse tones perfectly.<br /><br />All of the material has a blues influence, which was Rod's main musical background. But the album also draws from folk and even country roots, hence use of mandolin, violin and acoustic instruments. The best tracks are a matter of taste, but the opening title track, a superb hard driving acoustic rocker, and his poignant version of the closing track 'Reason To Believe', another acoustic number are reasons alone to buy this album. In between there is some really exquisite stuff like 'Mandolin Wind', featuring accomplished mandolin work by 'some guy who's name Rod forgot'. Then there is his excellent cover of Dylan's 'Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time'. With 'I'm Losing You', Rod gives this an extended rock and roll treatment rather different to the Temptations original. The famous single, 'Maggie May' is typical of the relaxed sound of The Faces, for although the album is listed as a Rod Stewart solo album, for most of the tracks it is Rod Stewart and the Faces, with drummer Mick Waller in place of Kenny Jones.<br /><br />It's best to brush aside the hindsight that Rod Stewart, with all the money he was to make over the next few years, was gradually to turn into a self-parodying old fart, which by the beginning of the next decade had sadly become the case. Nobody could have foreseen it when this album was released, and he was not the first or last to go down that tawdry road. EPTAS represents a youthful Rod during his best period of musical output. He had one of the finest 'white soul' voices around then, and this CD is a testament to that, and is still a pleasure to listen to. It hasn't aged one bit.it is Rod Stewart and the Faces, with drummer Mick Waller in place of Kenny Jones.  <br /> <br />It's best to brush aside the hindsight that Rod Stewart, with all the money he was to make over the next few years, was gradually to turn into a self-parodying old fart, which by the beginning of the next decade had sadly become the case.

0385513755|5.0|Enough has been said about the text of the Da Vinci Code in the years since its original release to fill many volumes (many of which can be purchased here at Amazon, as well!), so there's no need to retread the same old ground.  Our focus here is this beautifully wrought special edition.  Unlike many 'collector's' editions, this one really does make the experience of reading the novel richer.  The many photographs and other illustrations of the various landmarks, symbols and works of art in this volume provide another dimension, illuminating an already powerful story and providing some subtle scenery for the mind-movie that is this excellent novel.  Also, if you are, as I am, the kind of reader who is interested in esoteric Christianity and in history that is free from the dogma and exploitative propaganda of both the Catholic church and its major, protestant offshoots beyond the casual level, this edition of the Da Vinci Code makes an excellent companion to the equally lovely illustrated edition of Holy, Blood, Holy Grail (also available here at Amazon), the book that started the modern fuss over 'Mr. and Mrs. Christ' in the first place.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br /><br />  Julien S.

1932100660|3.0|Campbell's claim is simple: eat plant-based foods instead of animal-based foods, and you'll reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases, etc. <br /> <br />Like many here, I was disappointed by the lack of supporting evidence for Campbell's claims and the lack of data-driven insights from the China Study itself. <br /> <br />But Campbell seems to have bona fide credentials, so I decided to give a vegan diet a 2-month trial, which should be sufficient to see changes in my lipid profile. <br /> <br />A vegan diet doesn't appear to be a healthy diet for me based on my blood test results.   The diet had essentially no effect on my LDL level, but it seemed to cause my HDL to drop and triglycerides to increase significantly relative to my previous high-protein / low-carb diet. <br /> <br />I am not qualified to judge Campbell's work, but I believe he dismisses low-carb and calorie restriction studies too easily.   My lipid profile is the only health metric that I can easily measure, and my personal experience is that losing weight and restricting carbs gives me a better lipid profile than a vegan diet.
B00065MDRW|5.0|There are very few works in the rock genre that I would label as perfect or near perfect.  Here are a some that come to mind:<br /><br />Elliot Smith - X/O<br />Nick Drake - Bryter Layter<br />Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon<br />The Beatles - Revolver<br />The Rolling Stones-  Beggars Banquet<br />Jimi Hendrix - Axis: Bold as Love<br />King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King<br /><br />On with the review.  This was the debut work of the original King Crimson line-up.  It was also the swan-song as two of the four musicians announced they were leaving the band before the first US tour was complete.  Years later, when asked why he quit, McDonald replied \\"I was nuts.\\"<br /><br />With this release, King Crimson certainly planted an evergreen. But they also trampled on the flower.  Sad that, but it must have been daunting to try and follow up on this amazing debut.<br /><br />The music within these tracks ranges from intense electric \\"jazz-metal\\" to quiet, thoughtful improvisations.  The lyrics are all beautifully realized and poetic - perhaps a little to poetic for today's world, so what.<br /><br />In the Court of the Crimson King, upon first listen, is one of those records that hits one over the head with its brilliance.  The first time I heard this can only be compared to the first time I heard Jimi Hendrix (All Along the Watchtower) when I was a kid.  Indeed, after seeing this band live, Hendrix approached guitarist Robert Fripp, his right hand in a sling and said \\"shake my left hand, it's closer to my heart\\".  This band, though not very well known today, was the 800lb gorilla of 1969 and set the standard for all that came afterward.<br /><br />This is the band that later inspired the works of Genesis, Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Asia, and Pink Floyd.<br /><br />For you seasoned Crimson listeners, treat yourself to Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch (Bluenote), give it a thorough listen, and then listen to Ian McDonald's vibe playing on Moonchild.  I once asked Ian about Out to Lunch to which he replied \\"busted!\\"  Is it any coincidence that McDonald's choice of instrumentation on ITCOTCK is very similar to Dolphy's? (flute, alto-sax, bass clarinet)?  Giants always stand on the shoulders of other giants.hat McDonald's choice of instrumentation on ITCOTCK is very similar to Dolphy's?

B00005JOQS|5.0|Started reading Superman around 1940 or so, so I had low expectations. I was wrong. <br /> <br />Brendan Routh flows into the title role as close as possible to Christopher Reeve, to maintain continuity, and not introduce a delay in our reconnecting with the movie Superman. <br /> <br />Two shots in one scene recreate and pay homage to the Joe Shuster illustration, the most famous Superman drawing, from the cover of Action Comics #1. <br /> <br />On the radio Superman of 1940-1950, Bud Collyer, lacking the benefit of images, played Clark in a higher voice and Superman in a lower, as in \\"this looks like a job--FOR SUPERMAN!\\" So did this movie, but more subtly. <br /> <br />The artists behind this movie made a creative decision about the cape: It was less red overall, dark red on the outside, brighter on the inside, presumably so it would not dominate action visuals. <br /> <br />Another creative decision involves the little boy, but I won 't give that away. It does point the way to some new directions in this obvious Part I of the New Superman Cinema Serials. <br /> <br />We know how Kal-El landed on Earth. This movie gives us Clark's return as a rebirth paralleling his original arrival here. <br /> <br />Superman doesn't always fly/float in the movie. Sometimes his knee is bent as in the fly/leap drawings that went from inception through the eighties. Another homage. <br /> <br />And this one too: In the best Luthor stories of the early forties, when he was an \\"evil scientist,\\" Luthor wore a long robe, as drawn brilliantly by John SIkela. In this movie he wore a long overcoat which I take as another parallel. <br /> <br />So there were respect and tradition, as well as new ideas. The story? Well, not so much a story as a coillection of little episodes. <br /> <br />Superman worked as both a romantic hero, in the romance sense; and as a \\"romantic\\" hero, in the wouldn't-it-be-great-if... sense. And as to romance, give or take the actress playing Lois, who was adequateI guess--it was a very good job.  <br /> <br />For Superman.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This album is brilliant. It's probably yes's second best album (after Tales from Topographic Oceans). Sure, Bruford isn't the drummer, Wakeman isn't the keyboardist, but this album proves that yes doesn't need either of them. Patrick Moraz is a great keyboardist, and while not as skilled as Wakeman, has a very interesting style, one which I like a little better than Wakeman's style. He is certainly very good with the synthesizers, which the middle section of \\"Gates of Delerium\\" proves, with all the noises he makes with the synth. Alan White was at his peak on this album, and holds his own very well against Bill Bruford. It's a different, more straightforward style, but his drumming on this album is certainly excellent, and certainly more exciting than Bruford's style. Plus, he uses the junkyard kid in the middle of Gates of Delerium, which I absolutely love. <br /> <br />As for the songs... brilliant. Gates of Delirium is my favorite yes song. It builds up for about 10 minutes, then goes into a long, driving, and energetic instrumental section, where every member of the band shows off their skill to the fullest extent (except Anderson that is). It eventually winds down to a slow section called \\"soon,\\" which I take as the cry of the soldiers left on the battlefield, waiting for their final moment. It's beautiful. The lyrics fit very well, describing a battle. That battle takes place in the middle section, and even has weird noises (compliments of Alan White's junkyard kit and patrick moraz'z synthesizer skills) to go along with it. <br /> <br />Next is the insane, driving, and LOUD Sound Chaser. With its extended guitar solo, fast keyboards, and manic vocals, not to mention loud, jarring, and awesome drums. It's very experimental. <br /> <br />To close it is the slow, beautiful To Be Over, a great song, and Moraz'z keyboards provide most of the beauty here, along with Anderson's vocals. <br /> <br />Overall, brilliant, experimental prog rock album. Too bad Moraz wasonly with Yes for one album, and too bad Yes went way downhill after this. (Going for the One was decent, but not much more than that). Get it if you like prog rock or yes, but if you are new to prog, get fragile first.
0224076051|4.0|The impact of the book such as this on young minds, including me, is enormous. This is because to the eyes of untrained physics students everything seems convincing given that the argument presented tells only positive sides of the story. The very book which influenced me greatly is of course 'The Elegant Universe' and 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' by Brian Greene, a well known string theorist. It convincingly argues why string theory has to be 'The' grand unified theory, and anyone who has an ambition to make contribution in this field are easily drawn in. But be warned that this is merely a story told by someone else. Physics is a subject which you have to think for yourself and make final conclusions yourself. In this regard, the book 'Not Even Wrong' not only adds balance to the controversy but demands readers to think about these issues themselves, free from any outside influence.     The reason author bothers to go through the development of physical theories since the time of early 20th century is so that readers can see the apparent pattern in establishment of physical theories. That is, the constant interaction between theory and experiment and how this allows one to modify and refine older theory into better one such as standard model. Then reader can clearly see how this trend has deviated since the development of string theory which saw not a single experimental verification which will surely raise the eyebrows even if you are not an expert in this field.    Surely, the lack of experimental verification does not necessarily mean the string theory is wrong. And of course that is the attitude most string theorist take, that we are only seeing a tip of an iceberg so be patient. On this nobody knows the answer, hence the debate goes on and on.    The author argues there is more to the story and discuss how string theory has influence on social aspect including the job opportunity, narrow choice of research topics in order to 'survive'. This is more or less trueand to me this is a very important issue because in few years time, I will be the one who will be experiencing such situation myself.     Overall, I found the book well informed to read, but I must warn the general public who does not have solid physics background will find most of the material too technical. This book along with Brian Greene's book is a 'must read' for those who intend to go into high energy physics, so that reader can decide for themselves what 'they' think is right. I'm glad to see that now the controversy is not one sided because of this book and the effort of Peter Woit on his blog.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is an absolute masterwork, complete with its baroque flourishes and Bachian melodies.  To compare the album stylistically to the Beatles is just silly, as both artists stand fine on their own and equally inspired each other.  A better compairison would be the Beatles versus Brian Wilson's SMiLE, but that is not what this review is about. <br /> <br />If art reveals the spirit of the maker, then no truer words could be spoken about Pet Sounds. Brian Wilson has poured his heart and soul into the record and every sound on the album seems to resonate with some deep feeling inside himself he was trying to convey.  Wilson has said that this album was \\"made for the recording industry\\" and \\"artistic reasons rather than commercial ones\\", hence why he wasn't surprized by the album's failure to sell like previous Beach Boys efforts.  To say that Pet Sounds is ahead of its time would be wrong, because it is an album for all times and of classic, enduring themes.  The simplistic beauty of the melodies combined with Wilson's own Wall of Sound creates a triumphant expression of the emotions felt during one's coming-of-age. <br /> <br />Pet Sounds is an album that finds you.  When you get the right feeling, it comes to you like a refreshing wave of cool sadness to cure the ills of heartbreak, growing pains and modern-day confusion.  It seems to take the words right out of your mouth and translate them into an epic of harmonic glory, leaving you lost in the music, drifting along to the harpischords, flutes, falsetto voices and bells taking you to a place you always wanted to go but never knew how to get there. <br /> <br />To say that this album is a staple is an understatement.  It is essential for anyone who has ears, as well as anyone willing to explore sounds that reach the same level of depth and complexity that the emotional lyrics convey.  So, next time you find yourself pining for a lost love or just down in the dumps with no one to identify with, forget that ginand tonic, Pet Sounds is the best self-medication.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|I think a few reviewers have missed that Ottman was asked to use the Original John Williams theme in the score to help continuity of the films.  It was Brian Singer's idea to use this theme and start Superman Returns as a sequel to Superman 2.  Once you see the movie it will all make sense, as the film makers decided to ignore (and with good reason) Superman 3-4.  Even the opening credits have the same 'flying font' of the previous movies (I LOVED THAT!).  This film was not ment to be a reimagining like Batman Begins, but a continuation of the film series.  Thus it was extremely important to keep John Williams' already fantastic theme, and I dig that.  Besides, how can you improve on it? <br /> <br />The film sort of disappointed me after seeing it, but I find myself a day later really liking it and hoping for a sequel.  So, I have to say, my intial thoughts were wrong and I really enjoyed it.  I mean, it was cool all the way around, even Kumar as one of the bad guys was cool!  Anyway, this is a good score, it just has more 'Pop' than the Williams soundtracks to fit with the more epic look of the film.  The Score sounds great, and is well worth the money.  You won't be disappointed.
0060920084|3.0|I picked this book up after reading \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"Mother Toungue,\\" both amazing books that broadened my appreciation for life and nourished me with laughter.  This older book was not up to par with his newer writing.  I won't re-hash the premise and mechanics of this book (it's already been done well), but I will say that I laughed through the first third, smirked through the middle third, and dutifully soldiered on to the end.  I got the impression that he was too tired to appreciate part two of his trip, and perhaps would have been more charitable (or at least funnier) had he put more time between the two trips.  Whereas the first half was imaginative in its snarkiness, the second half read like a flight log penned by an AM Talk Radio host (Very rough paraphrase): \\"Went to Bilgewater, MT and found the most convenient (sic)ho el and the waitress at the only restaurant was a gum-chewing twit. What a dump.  Went to Muffinthatch, KS and found the most convenient hotel and I was afraid the waitress would spit in my food.\\"  And so on... <br /> <br />On the other hand, the tone Bryson gradually affects in the book mimics beautifully the weary, inarticulate crabbiness you'd experience at the end of a long road trip, the kind of curmudgeonly disdain for all which we would all begin to feel after the seventeenth dive diner in nineteen days of a roadtrip across the American West.    <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Don't pay full price for this book.  Find it at a library or bargain bin, read the first half for painfully frequent bouts of laughter, and then set it aside before it gets tedious. <br /> <br />A final note: one should not search for great small towns in America by aimlessly traveling the interstate.  The sort of small towns that might have uplifted Bryson were probably lurking on nearby state and local roads.  For anyone considering a great American roadtrip who is looking for a shade of De Toqueville, try looking up cities that have wonvarious civic awards like \\"All American City,\\" and \\"Most Livable City.\\"  I think you'll have better luck.
6305511055|4.0|This is a great action thriller, except for the scenes between Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway because they defy reality.  The book \\"Six Days of the Condor\\" by James Grady is way better.   <br /> <br />The film starts out very well.  Condor slips out the back door (and leaves it open!) to make a food run at lunch time.  When he returns, he finds everybody gunned down inside - his girlfriend too!  Boy is he angry!  He can't wait to find her killer.   <br /> <br />But wait. . .  he can wait!  Oh yeah.  He finds Faye Dunaway and they throw a private lust party, while trying to stay a step ahead of his girlfriend's killers.   Finally, his girlfriend's killer catches up with him.  Condor thinks he's a gonner.   <br /> <br />But wait. . . the hitman, named Jobair, informs him that he's been hired to kill the boss instead of Condor.  But he warns Condor that they will get around to killing him too.  Condor somehow contains all his anger and revenge towards his girlfriend's killer and says \\"You seem to understand it all - what would you do?\\"  Jobair says \\"Personally I prefer Europe\\".  After chatting like newfound friends, Jobair gives back Condor's pistol.  Condor doesn't shoot Jobair, instead he lets Jobair give a lift to the station. <br /> <br />Dumb scenes like this prevent this otherwise great action thriller from making a five.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|This was what I expected as far as serious subjects and may be hard to watch because the underlying story is so close to raw truths. A great movie dealing with complex cultures, greed, and frustration over the power struggles that seem to drown out the cry of compassion for our fellow human beings. It was odd seeing Clooney heavier than usual and I heard the extra weight caused a back problem. Hope he's on the road to recovery. What these actors won't go through to make a role more realistic! I enjoyed this film and the subtle, intelligent debate over some real issues, but one may want to follow it up with a light hearted comedy before bed. There are a few depressing scenes.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000021XS0|5.0|I bought this album because I had heard it was their best.  The only DT I had heard was the first disc of 6DOIT.  SFAM blew me away.  I'm sure if you're reading this you know it's a concept album / rock opera.  The story is awesome and takes several listens to figure out.  It works both your ears and your mind. <br /> <br />I haven't been blown away by an album in a long time...and not to the extent of this album.  From start to finish it's an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br />I'm not going to do a track by track review, but standouts are Overture 1928, Beyond This Life, The Dance of Eternity, and Finally Free.  Listening to this album I was thinking...\\"wow, they're amazing musicians\\", then came The Dance of Eternity and my jaw hit the floor.  And the transition from that track to One Last Time gives me chills every time I hear it.  Finally Free is the culmination of the entire album and ties up all the loose ends in the story. <br /> <br />If you don't have any DT albums...BUY THIS ONE NOW!!!
0811833887|5.0|This is the type of book that makes you smile and sigh a little and then pet it. :] <br /> <br />I'm a Pixar fan and I'm working on collecting all the \\"Art of\\" books. So far I have this Monster's Inc. one and Finding Nemo. What's odd about these books is that they are all pretty different. Some contain more commentary than others and the concept art is drawn in different styles. This book has very little commentary and it is in the style of a very cartoony modern art. Finding Nemo on the other hand, has a lot of commentary to take you into the minds of the artists. The Finding Nemo book is also in a more realistic style and a lot of it is charcoal drawings. <br /> <br />So it depends on the type of person you are to tell which \\"Art of\\" book to buy. Monster's Inc is a lot more colorful and i feel it's more exciting because you can really see the development of the characters and setting and the gradual changes to what you see in the movie. I really enjoyed this book and I find myself flipping through it over and over again even though I read the whole thing in one sitting when I first received it. It's an amazing addition to any artist and Pixar fan.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins always were Billy Corgan's band. It became even more evident on Siamese dream, the band's follow-up to Gish. Corgan plays all of the guitar and bass parts on every  song. Jimmy Chamberlin is the only member of the Smashing Pumpkins to have a part in this album other than Corgan, he does precussion. Whether Corgan's clinical depression is to blame or his control-freak mentality, the album remains one the finest alternative rock albums of the 1990's.  <br /> <br />The album opens with a drum roll and then an explosion of sub-sabbath guitar on Cherub Rock. The first five tracks of the album are album are all about layering and metallic riffs, making the listener think the album is metal album. <br /> <br />The mood quickly changes on Disarm, and orchestral ballad in which Corgan dourly conveys his thoughts about his childhood and his parents.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is a hybrid of extremely soft music and heavy sounding music. In some intervals of the songs there is clearly some progressive rock too. As you finish listening to the album allow me to congratulate you. You have just listened to quite possibly the best alternative rock album of the '90's  <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOX6|3.0|I remember when I was in third grade, I read this children's short story collection called \\"Uncanny\\" by Paul Jennings. There was a short story called \\"Spaghetti Pig Out\\" which involved this kid getting this magic remote which could control real life, which ends up being used in a spaghetti eating contest. I don't know if there's any connection, but \\"Click\\", the new Adam Sandler comedy, also involves a magic remote that can control the things around you.  <br /> <br />Adam Sandler plays an architect, Michael, a man looking for that next big promotion, so he can give his wife, his son and his daughter all the things he never had as a kid. Working so hard, he just doesn't seem to have enough time to spend with his children, or with his parents or wife. He doesn't even have enough time to memorize which of the remotes in his house operates what. He tries to turn on the TV, but his garage door opens, or the fan goes off. To save some desperately needed time, he goes to a \\"Beds, Baths and Beyond\\" store to buy a universal remote, just like the one his neighbours, the O'Doyles, have (I wonder if they're related to the O'Doyles in \\"Billy Madison\\"?). Their universal remote, he's told, can be pointed at any appliance and get it to do what he wants to do. He wanders into the \\"Beyond\\" section of \\"Beds, Bath and Beyond\\", and finds Morty (Christopher Walken), a man who appears to be some sort of scientist. He gives the architect a universal remote all right, a little too universal. It not only controls any appliance, but his own life. Michael can fast forward through things, rewind to reminisce, pause to stop and think, mute anyone too loud or annoying. But the remote doesn't just have video-like commands, but DVD ones too. Michael can access his \\"life menu\\", change languages, adjust color, and even get his own commentary (by James Earl Jones, no less). And just like amazon.com, this special remote can remember the users preferences. It all seems pretty great at first, but then ofcourse things start to go wrong, and far beyond anything I expected... <br /> <br />It's a great idea, I thought, and I like all the ways in which the remote is used. I also like the fact the film decides to push things forward and go really extreme with some of the remote's consequences toward the end. Christopher Walken was great, he was funny, but also kinda scary in the few parts he had to be. Adam is his usual self, though you get to see him do a bit of dramatic stuff here, a few tears, some emotion, which was interesting to see him do. I reckon he could do a really moving drama comedy one day, if he put his mind to it. He doesn't quite do it here, though. <br /> <br />I know I should have expected it, being an Adam Sandler film and everything, but I did find some parta to be a little crude. Sandler seems to be a family man here, and the message of the film is all about family. Having dogs humping giant stuffed ducks and a little girl making comments about crack seemed a little out of place here. Unlike Sandlers other films, where the immature humour kind of fits into the atmosphere, sometimes I felt the writers were being nasty for the sake of nasty. Left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br />It's a reasonable film, and worth a look because its an interesting concept, though if I had a universal remote like Adam's I'm not sure I'd rewind back to my favorite cinema and watch it again in a hurry. Three and a half stars.
0670033375|4.0|This is an important book about why societies, ancient and modern, collapse.  Given Professor Diamond's background in the environmental movement, it's no surprise that he sees the reasons as ultimately environmental.  That is, people in a culture have to choose how they will respond to their environment, and it they choose poorly, they may pay with their lives-- and the lives of everyone else.<br /><br />The one thing that I see as missing in Prof. Diamond's analysis is the role of human fallibility (plain stupidity, greed, etc.) in the collapse of cultures.  When he does consider, for example, poorly conceived warfare, he sees the causes of the wars as environmental.  That's not always the way it is.<br /><br />Prof. Diamond acknowledges that he used much of the material in the book in classes he taught at UCLA, and the book shows it.  That is, in many places it reads like the transcript of a lecture, complete with the signposting and internal summaries that good lecturers employ.  This, in part, is responsible for the one thing I really didn't like about the book.  An absolutely outstanding 350 page book is hiding somewhere in these 575 pages (hardback edition) of text, shouting to be set free.<br /><br />In short, the book is valuable, but reading it can be a chore.
B000683VI4|1.0|Something everyone must understand when they watch this movie is that Gena Rowland's portrayal of a woman with Alzheimer's Disease is not at all like the reality of Alzheimer's disease.  This character appears bright, she can follow conversation and answer appropriately, she speaks in full sentences, and she is able to remember from one minute to the next that she is being read a story.  And yet she can't remember that the man reading her the story is her husband.  ACTUALLY, Alzheimer's works the opposite way.  It's the short-term memory that goes first.  May Alzheimer's patients can remember things that happened 50 or 60 years ago in vivid detail but can't follow what is going on around them or manage even the simplest task taking place in the present.  This woman wouldn't forget her husband and children until she was so far along in her disease that she would be bed-ridden, her speech would be nonsensical, she wouldn't remember things from minute to minute, and she'd have long since forgotten how to do things like fold a napkin and place it on her lap.   <br /> <br />I certainly understand the emotional appeal of this movie, and I'm glad that it takes a look at the issues of older adults, chronic illness, death, and life-long relationships.  We need more of that in our books and movies.  But the fact that this movie portrayed Alzheimer's in a way that is so unlike the reality of Alzheimer's completely ruined it for me.  If it doesn't bother you, then you'll probably like this movie.  I just wish that the author and the director would have done some research into the disease process before making this movie.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I have been hearing loads about this girl from friends in the UK, and also on the net. Every word they said was true.. a beautiful, refreshing, breeze of change. For those of us who love our soul, r&b, music-with-heart and feeling.. hell, ANYTHING good... this is a GREAT sign of what I hope will come to fruition in the incredibly crappy American music scene... Thank you Corinne, we needed this badly...  THANK YOU FOR NO COLLABO'S !! Thanks for no guest 'artists' to destroy your work...  I can't wait to see you in Austin. Beautiful soul.... plain and simple.
B00005LC4B|3.0|Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear reminds us the best time to argue about the awful direction your strained, upper-middle class marriage has taken is while hiding from a vengeful ex-con who's trying to rape your teenaged daughter. If this were Ladies' Home Journal, I would agree, yes, This Marriage Cannot Be Saved. Now, I care for their dog, and I care for their maid (but not that hussy Ileana Douglas); however, they merely suffer so that Nick Nolte can appear sweatier and smoke more, and Jessica Lange might hurl accusations of infidilety at him with her pinched little hatchet face. And let's not forget the coltish Juliette Lewis stumbling around just asking for it--from Cady or Daddy or poor old dirty Henry Miller. There is much delineation of the moral ambiguities we all face, including about 10 seconds on the Book of Job, and a whole lotta tattooed, Biblically-referenced flesh to sort out--despite the preaching, I found I deeply desired to see that teddy bear which Joe Don Baker rigs up with some fishing line get decapitated. And do I have the pleasure of watching that occur? --hell no!-- Scorsese won't go there, because that would be gratuitous violence which doesn't advance the plot one bit. And as this is a serious, scary movie about the eternal battle of evil vs. evil-er-est, I suppose I wouldn't want my delicate moral compass to be upset by all that fluff and stuffing. **SPOILER ALERT!**: Evil wins! DeNiro Flambe! And seeing Jessica Lange aghast & covered in mud inspired my roommate Matt to start a production of a third, Butoh Dance remake of Cape Fear: it cuts through all the relativism/moral shades-of-gray by getting rid of all the words and meaning and just keeping the literal, bodily-writhing shades-of-gray.  Watch for it! It's very artistic!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I regret not having seen Firefly on its original TV run, but I'm glad I finally listened to a friend whose series taste I trust and picked up the set (I originally bought it back in August '05, but lost my entire DVD and book collections under tragic circumstances). I'm so happy that I was talked into getting it! It's turned out one of my favourite and most watched DVD sets, along with BtVS and Angel. After having been a fan of both other series' for many years, I should have trusted in Joss all along! ;)

B00005JOQS|3.0|Mind, there was much that was good about Superman Returns. The whole story line of love between Superman and Lois Lane lost and perhaps found again tug just a tad at the heart strings. And the special effects, especially the flying scenes and the one with bullets bouncing off Superman in slowmo, were first rate.<br /><br />But there were some flaws. First, one realizes that one would like to pay a little homage to the Chris Reeve Superman. But when one lifts entire pages of dialogue from the 1978 film, it comes closer to plagerism.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey does not play a convincing super villan. He terribly underplays Lex Luthor until the moment that Superman is in his power, and then he lets his inner rage loose to great effect. The evil plot seemed derivitive and trite to this reviewer.<br /><br />Finally, would it have hurt to have said, \\"Truth, justice, and the American Way?\\" Superman is an iconic American hero, an immigrant glad of the refuge America has given him and wanting veru much to give back. The Man of Steel should not be made to pass some kind of \\"international test\\" to prove that he is really a citizen of the world, just to boost ticket sales in parts of the world where Americans are hated.
0780626494|5.0|Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone are wonderful in the light hearted romantic comedy about a man named Adam Weber's (Fraser) first steps into society after being in a fallout shelter for his entire life.  <br /> <br />Fraser's parents are played by the flawless Christopher Walken and the wonderful Sissy Spacek. Walken is a scientist who mistakes a plane crash in his backyard for a Cuban nuclear missile strike. He takes his family into a fallout shelter, that he has spent many months building to wait until the time is right to surface. Thirty-five years later, he emerges to find Joey Slotnick managing a rundown bar. Thinking that Walken is God, Slotnick becomes Archbishop Melker who tells his followers that he has seen God -- never mind that he is an alcoholic and a drug addict. <br /> <br />Walken suffers what seems like a heart attack, it is decided that Adam should be the one to go to the surface in search of supplies.  Fraser surfaces and begins his quest for food and a woman. Along the way, he experiences the wonders of color television, sees a black postal worker who delivers one of the funniest lines in the movie. <br /> <br />He runs into Alicia Silverstone, when he tries to sell his baseball cards and is cheated by the proprietor.  Eve (Silverstone) is angry that he is buying the cards for little or nothing, they are worth three times the amount that he gives Adam.  She speaks up and Adam befriends her when he realizes he needs a someone to help him. He asks Eve to take him to a Hotel which she does and they he asks her to work for him.  She agrees and takes him to her house and introduces him to her friend, Dave Foley, who turns in a wonderful performance. <br /> <br />Eve falls in love with Adam but is afraid that he is off his rocker.  She turns him to the authorities and he escapes, she goes to his hotel room where her friend convinces him that he is on the level.  She drives around looking for him and spots him and in the end goes to get his motherand father, builds a new home for them and lives happily ever after.
B00005JOQS|2.0|This movie was disappointing, but then life is full of disappointments, isn't it?  I had hopes for Superman Returns, as I had enjoyed both of Mr. Singer's X-Men flicks, but this one just wasn't particularly interesting or involving.  The first hour-plus is very slow, overall the story falls flat, this particular Lex Luthor is a boring villain, and there are several other problems with the movie (like things that don't make sense).  The acting by Mr. Routh and Ms. Bosworth is good, but that makes little difference when it's in service of a ho-hum story.  I was left thinking that just about everything that can be done with the Superman concept in movies has already been done, and it's time to put it to rest, movie-wise.
0613930096|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex And The City is one of the comedies for the '90's, a slick, classy affair that's not afraid to push the boundaries to the limit. It's graphic (sort of) depiction of sex is ground-breaking, yet it doesn't forget it's main reason for being out there, to be funny.  Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon are exemplary as Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. The supporting players (Chris Noth, etc.) are helpful and the plotlines are racy and hilarious.<br /><br />Viewing this DVD made me a weekly watcher of the HBO series. Everything you always wanted to know about women, men and sex as seen through the eyes of four ladies with something for everyone. Seemingly no subject is taboo with this group and it's all done in an appealing and intelligent way. Highly recommended for men and women.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have been a fan of Mark Knopfler ever since the first Dire Straits, and have been intensely following his solo career.  While his past few solos were starting to sound the same, this collaboration with the inimitable Emmylou is a breath of fresh air for both.  She hasn't sounded better in years, and he shows that his voice actually has some range.  Mark also shows us here more than anywhere that he is as skilled a lyrical song writer (the title track is probably his finest ever) as he is with melody.  The only forgetable piece here is \\"Donkey Town.\\" This CD makes me wonder if Mark Knopfler may be at his best in collaboration.  Who's next?  Mindy Smith? Sheryl Crow? How about Annie Lennox?  Now that would be interesting!
B00005JOQS|5.0|This movie is Bryan Singer's third comic book adaption movie. His first two were x-men and x-men 2 which were awesome films. Now he takes a spin on Superman which does not dissapoint. He does well with the story and the action scenes and special effects were fantastic. All though the movie did have a slow start it was still a great movie.But that was kind of important to have a slow beginning because there was a lot to tell story wize like why Superman was gone for so long and how the world changed with out him. In this film you will actualy feel bad for superman there are some parts where you will be like poor Superman.  Brandon Routh makes a excellent Superman and Clark Kent. His Clark Kent though isn't as dorky as the Christopher Reeves Clark Kent.But he still pulls it off well.Lex Luther isn't as goofy as he was in the other films he is a lot more serious and sinister. but if you were a fan of the other Superman films you won't be dissapointed. I think this movie is just as good as the first two Superman films but better than the last two. So check this movie out.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! At the Disco's CD, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out is worth  every penny, every song was cleverly written because the songs are addicting, and the music is uniquely original, that many a times you find yourself dancing to their CD. I enjoyed every song on this CD. The thing I enjoy most about the CD is that you never tire of listening to it, and a CD like that, like Panic's is rare to come across. Upon the first thorough play of the CD I found myself wondering what they would say next, it was brilliant, they tell a story with each song, and that is what attracts me to their music. The songs are catchy, and clever, and with the band consisting of talent like Ryan Ross on guitar, Spencer Smith on drums, new member, Jon on bass and the leading vocals of Brendon Urie you find yourself coming back for more....the day it came out (September 27, 2005) I rushed out to buy it, and it is the best CD I have ever bought so get your hands on it now...so you can catch the fever.
B000002MY3|4.0|I still have the cassette of this album (which I've had since 1995) and I plan on getting the CD soon. I bought her best of album last November.  Alanis Morissette made a dynamic album that fully defines grunge and alternative rock's 6-year dominance in the 90s.  Everything all clicks on here!  I still like to scream when singing the chorus of You Oughta Know! And still like to turn it up every time!  She's not taking no mess when she chews her man up for cheating on her in that song! This song just came out of nowhere in 1995 just as people were still playing their 1994 Hootie and the Blowfish albums way too much.  A lot of this album has to be personal, especially You Learn, Hand In My Pocket, Wake Up, Forgiven, Ironic and many others.  This album is strong in its rock sound, its lead guitars and full wall of sound on every cut! You Oughta even has shades of hip-hop's beats in its rock sound.  I was so pleased that it won Album of the Year at the Grammys (and I didn't even watch that show!) because it broke the mold of the same kind of safe pop album that those voters like to choose (soft and sappy Diane Warren-like pop ballads and so forth). This was the LOUD album that the Grammys finally chose long after Michael Jackson's hugely succesful Thriller from the '80s!  Alanis has still maintained a strong fan base and her music still sounds great with her later albums.  She does the music SHE wants to do and she is winning at all counts.  Jagged Little Pill will always be a favorite and a classic from me!

1400032717|5.0|Through Christopher's voice, the author managed to transport both to a new world, and to open my eyes to the world experienced by the autistic that move among us. I now understand a bit better what it must be like to love someone like Christopher, who really doesn't know how to reciprocate those feelings in a conventional, tangible way. I am awed by the patience of teachers like Siobbhan. And I was completely enchanged by Christopher. While I was sensitive to the pain and conflict all around him, I was enchanted by Christopher, start to finish.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I went in to see \\"Superman Returns\\" with cautious optimism. The idea of finally seeing the world's most beloved superhero return to the big screen was a great one. However, I had some concerns with the people behind the scenes. I feared that the idea of making the Man of Steel a more emotionally-complex character would turn this into another melodramatic cry-baby fest, like the overrated \\"Spider-Man\\" movies. Also, I was not excited  with the idea of Bryan Singer directing, as the \\"X-Men\\" movies were not among my all-time favorites. And even though he had let Singer do the movie he wanted, producer Jon Peters had shown signs of ruining a new \\"Superman\\" movie (Just listen to what Kevin Smith said on the \\"An Evening with Kevin Smith\\" DVD).<br /><br />However, I left the theater with a huge smile on may face. While no film could come close to matching the first \\"Superman\\" movie from 1978, this new movie is still very good. The cast and crew have done a fantastic job of creating an exciting, character-driven motion picture. Brandon Routh does a fine job of filling the shoes of Christopher Reeve. He brings the warmth and humor that Reeve gave to both Clark Kent and Superman. And while the character is more emotionally-complex, he doesn't come across as a panzy like Tobey Maguire does in the \\"Spider-Man\\" films.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey does a terrific job as Lex Luthor. He retains the humor that Gene Hackman brought to the role, but also gives him a darker edge, making his version of the character more similar to the comic-book. The only real problem cast-wise is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She's just a bit too young to play the character. However, she still manages to do a fine job. The rest of the cast does a commendable job as well.<br /><br />Bryan Singer and his crew have done a terrific job of brining Superman back to the screen with the excitement, humor, and joy that made the first movie a classic. The plot is interesting, the story is believable, and the visual effects are Oscar-worthy. And while some may quibble with the comparisons of Superman to Christ, this doesn't detract from the film any at all.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" is great film-making. It ranks alongside \\"Batman Begins\\" as one of the greatest super-hero films of the modern era. I highly recommend \\"Superman Returns\\" to both Superman fans and fans of great films. You're sure to enjoy it.<br /><br />Grade: A+al effects are Oscar-worthy.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Welcome to Hostel, where cute, naïve American backpackers are gruesomely tortured and killed...at least the girls are gorgeous. <br /> <br />When released, Hostel was characterised by the press - at least in Australia - as little more than a cheap gore-fest. It isn't. Much like another recent release which I have reviewed, Wolf Creek, Hostel is a deeply disturbing and hyper-realistic horror film. Such films, even among the dross which has dominated the genre in recent years, have convinced this horror fan that the form is experiencing a renaissance in quality. <br /> <br />The story sees a pair of endearingly boorish young yanks, with that uniquely adolescent mixture of bravado, awkwardness and limitless sexual appetite, let loose in Amsterdam with their recently-acquired Icelandic companion. While he and the hotter of our two Americans, played by an impeccably cast Jay Hernandez, enjoy what is on offer, the more sympathetic lead has reservations, his horniness tempered by yearnings for his ex and, just maybe, the slightest of moral objections. <br /> <br />But even he cannot resist the promise of carnal delights lying farther to the east, in a ridiculously opulent hostel in small-town Slovakia, no less. There, the boys bed some beautiful women, who are admirably unrestrained in their exhibitionism, the Icelander disappears, and Hostel swings itself - and its chainsaw, scalpel and other implements of torture - into gear. And it doesn't slow down. <br /> <br />Whilst the set-up is a variant of the \\"kids wandering into places they shouldn't\\" horror cliché, it is a certainly a sophisticated one, full of thematic possibilities. Director Eli Roth (who previously directed the iffy Cabin Fever) sensibly leaves these themes to their own devices, concentrating on the chilling narrative and visuals which are almost universally incredible. <br /> <br />The only real gripe I have about the film is the somewhat over-the-top decrepitude, darkness and dirt which characterises the sets used in the torture \\"money scenes\\". This is becoming a trend, films such as Saw suffer the same evocative extravagance. Less can be more, the backdrops should support the impact of the terrible deeds done within them, not overwhelm it. <br /> <br />Another genre offering not for the faint-hearted, horror fans should definitely buy this DVD for their collection, but, then again, they probably already have!   <br />
B000AP04OM|1.0|This production does not do the least credit of the final masterpiece between the most <br />Legendary collaboration in theatre history. Rodgers and Hammerstein. <br /> <br /> <br />When I was young and haven't even started showing particular interest in musical  <br />Theatre and use to see this film. I always ended up saying the same phrase <br />\\"I don't like The Sound of Music\\" But my opinion changed drastically when I saw <br />the stage version. <br /> <br />To begin with, why were How can Love survive? and No Way to stop it swooped into <br />Boring long conversations. And why was that stanza which describes Maria`s character <br />Left out. <br /> <br /> My day in the hills <br />Has come to an end, I know. <br />A star has come out <br />To tell me it's time to go. <br />But deep in the dark green shadows, <br />There are voices that urge me to stay. <br />So I pause and I wait and I listen, <br />For one more sound, <br />For one more lovely thing <br />That the hills might say! <br /> <br />I'd recommend the stage version, to appreciate this classical work, rather than this <br />Film. Julie Andrews is a very good actress and a singer but Maria von Trapp wasn't the <br />Role for her. I think that with her rich English accent and sopranic voice would have made a perfect Baroness. At least I enjoyed the brilliant acting by all the actors. All <br />Of them fitted the role perfectly. If they worked on the original script by Howard Lindsay <br />And Russel Crouse. This movie would have been the most perfect film ever made in the <br />History of cinema. <br />
B000FQJAIW|4.0|After literally YEARS of constant pestering from fans (including people sending smashed up versions of their VHS copies of Star Wars to LucasFilm and famous comments such as \\"George Lucas Raped My Childhood!\\" - I kid ye not) George Lucas has finally relented and allowed the 'original theatrical versions' of the trilogy to be released on DVD.    For a long time he refused to re-release these original versions at all, saying that the latest \\"Special Editions\\" were his original intention, and the version of the films he was most happy with. In other words, \\"tough\\" to all those who wanted the 'Original Theatrical Releases' on DVD (ie. versions of Star Wars without the new computer jiggery-pokery added in the 1997 'Special Editions').    Lucas spent millions clearing up the original negatives for the recent DVD release (the digital mastering house responsible for the clean up commented that some *single* frames contained over a million pieces of dirt!). He also spent further money touching up some of the dodgier 'computer effects' that had been added in 1997 (this time without telling anyone; he did it just because he wanted to) for the release.    Nobody complained about the amount of work that must have gone into making these DVDs LOOK so stunning. Their visual quality was nothing short of amazing: The original low-budget \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" matched it's high budget sequels in visual polish. The only complaints came from fans of the original theatrical releases: \\"Han shot first!\\", they exclaimed, referring to the infamously altered cantina scene.    They still wanted their 'original theatrical release' on DVD. They didn't want the new special effects. They didn't care that George Lucas said that his new version was the way he claims he'd always wanted Star Wars to be... they just wanted their original memories of the film they grew up loving to be on DVD.    After years of this pressure, and safe in the knowledge that most people had already bought his \\"intended\\" versions of Star Wars, he decided to go back and see if he actually *could* release the \\"original theatrical releases\\" to appease these pestering fans.    \\"No!\\", was the inevitable answer. He'd already spent millions restoring the original negatives, piecing them together for his \\"final finished version\\" of the Star Wars movies, why should he go back and spend *more* money doing it all over again for a small, but vocal, collection of fans?    Then someone pointed out that in the mid-nineties a Laser-Disc version of the \\"original theatrical releases\\" had been released. The quality was actually pretty good, and the masters used in the Laser-Disc's release still existed! Basically it would be possible to use these masters to create a new DVD release of the 'original theatrical versions', plus it would be cheap and easy to do. The masters weren't anamorphic, but they were certainly better than the VHS versions that had been available, even better than the Laser-Disc versions that they had been used to make, and it beat the alternative: Not releasing the 'original theatrical releases' and still having upset fans.    So the wheels were put into motion: For a \\"limited time\\" only these \\"new\\" DVD versions would be available to the public, with one stipulations: They came with George Lucas's \\"final finished versions\\" that had already been released (why should he suffer under the thought that someone might be watching the 'original theatrical releases' thinking that they were the 'finished' versions?).    These masters have allowed these DVDs to exist, and the only reason they DO exist is to appease the vocal fans who demanded them. There was NO way Lucas was going to go back and spend further money on what is essentially a niche item for a selection of vocal hardcore fans. Plus he didn't want to go back to the versions of Star Wars that had tortured him since their release, what with all their little inconsistencies and poor special effects... that was NOT how he wanted Star Wars to be.    So, what are these releases actually like? Well, I've seen the screenshots that have been released (you can find them online if you search) and thankfully these editions look a *million* times better than any previous versions of the 'original theatrical releases' that have been available.    I for one, am pleased. For once George Lucas listened to his fans, at least somewhat, and (within reason) he's given them what they wanted and could not have gotten any other way.     Remember, though:   - They're NOT anamorphic, so the quality isn't as high as it could be.  - This is the ONLY way we're ever going to see them. (Sadly.)    I'm one of the one original people who petitioned George Lucas in the first place and these DVDs are a Good Thing if you care about seeing or owning the 'original theatrical releases' and film preservation. The quality is still VERY GOOD (look online and see for yourself) and this is, unfortunately, the only way we're ever going to get them.
B00005JOQS|5.0|First a confession--I really liked Richard Donner's first film. If you didn't like Donner's treatment of the subject you're not going to like this film and you're probably not going to like my review. Then you'll give me a \\"not helpful vote\\" and move on to express your opinion. For those who enjoyed Donner's film read on for those that didn't skip this film and go see \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" or \\"X3\\" again.<br /><br />The film is certainly flawed. 1) It's too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. It could easily have been cut by 40 minutes without damaging the story. 2) The pacing is off (which probably has a lot to do with the running time). The film builds to a climax and has to rebuild again when its defused. 3)The \\"Messiah\\" imagery is overused. Richard Donner's original film was flawed as well (it was too long and the whole sequence with Superman and Lois Lane flying could have been cut to a minute)so, in that respect, \\"Superman Returns\\" has a lot in common with Richard Donner's film and \\"Superman II\\" (the film to which this is a sequel). It's still darn good entertainment.<br /><br />Like \\"Superman\\" \\"Superman Returns\\" is fun populist entertainment. \\"Superman Returns\\" doesn't have the dark edge (nor despite what's been written a gay subtext) like \\"X-Men\\" or \\"X2\\" the two other superhero films that director Bryan Singer has made. It's pure, sweet and comic with some interesting themes and conflict. Sure it isn't the Superman of the comics nor of the TV series or cartoons but I didn't care then nor do I care now about that. The late Christopher Reeve was perfectly cast as Superman and even Margot Kidder worked well as the scattered Lois Lane. Donner's job was to reinvent Superman for a new audience.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's film captures the same qualities that made Donner's film so fun to begin with and he's stayed true (for the most part) to the 1978 film's mythology. The film isn't perfect (how could it be? It's a sequel to a film made nearly 30 years ago!)but it's darn good.<br /><br />**There are some minor spoilers ahead so you may want to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film.**<br /><br />Superman (newcomer Brandon Routh in a marvelous performance that captures elements of Reeve's while establishing the role as his own)has been absent for 5 years. When the location of Krypton was identified he decided to return and see if anything remained of his home world. Exposure to Kryptonite in space weakened him but he manages to return to the Kent farm after his absence and recovers with the help of his mother Martha (the great Eva Marie Saint). He also briefly recalls his youth when he first discovered his superpowers.<br /><br />He returns as Clark Kent to Metropolis and is rehired by Perry White (Frank Langella)only to discover that Lois (Kate Bosworth)has moved on with her life and has a five year boy and has won the Pulitzer Prizer for an editorial entitled \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman\\". Clearly she has issues with Supes. She's also taken up with Perry's nephew and the paper's associate editor Richard White (James Marsden from \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X-Men 2\\")living with him. The only one who seems to have missed him is Jimmy (Sam Huntington).<br /><br />Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey who fills Gene Hackman's shoes nicely bringing a deliciously evil edge to Lex)is free as Superman never showed during the parole hearings to argue for his incarceration. He has a plan and it involves in a perfect quotation from the original film, \\"land\\" and the death of billions. Lex returns to the Fortress of Solitude and learns everything he can about Superman and his lost world before stealing important artifacts.<br /><br />**End of Spoilers**<br /><br />Singer recreates the feel of the original film while bringing a look that is uniquely his own to the film with its marvelous art deco production design. The story written in collaboration with \\"X2\\" writers Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (who also co-wrote the forthcoming remake of \\"Logan's Run\\")quotes liberally from both Donner's \\"Superman\\" (even using footage and recordings of Marlon Brando as Jor-El)and the George Reeves TV series (with cameos by Noel Neill and Jack Larson). Heck, Singer even throws in the iconic final shot from \\"Superman\\" and \\"Superman II\\" with Supes circling the Earth for good measure. It's clear that this film was a labor of love but also an attempt to examine a lot of themes that are essential to the Superman mythos including the Messiah myth as well as the unresolved love affair with Lois. Singer's direction of the actors is top notch. If the film is flawed its due to its running time--\\"Superman Returns\\" probably could have been trimmed by a good 20 minutes (much like Donner's \\"Superman\\")and worked just as well. Still all that screen time allows Singer to maximize the action set pieces (including a stunning robbery where Superman proves that bullets do indeed bounce off of him) without sacrificing the chararcter development.<br /><br />Routh manages to channel Reeve's winning performance as Superman/Clark Kent staying true to Reeve and Donner's(and writer Tom Mankiewicz's) interpretation of the character. Routh manages to inject enough of his own personality and make the character his own while still touching on Reeve's interpretation. Although Kate Kosworth's Lois might be a bit less kooky than Margot Kidder's take on the role she's as hard nosed a reporter and a bit more believable when it comes to helping Superman. James Marsden works well as the third part of this romantic love triangle as the new man in Lois' life. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lex much like Routh touching on Gene Hackman's performance but adding an edgy dangerous edge missing from Hackman's. Spacey's Lex is someone that you could believe would kill billions just to make a \\"killing\\" on a land deal.<br /><br />The visual effects are truly stunning and state of the art. The sequence involving the launch of the new space shuttle and its mishap is brilliantly realized. Much the same can be said for some of the other sequences involving the foiled robbery and the unexpectedly moving conclusion which refers to the Messiah myth and a recent Superman comic book.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" is a loving valentine to a film that Singer clearly respected and loved (heck he even uses John Williams \\"Superman\\" theme and the same opening title design as in the first film). I'd highly recommend \\"Superman Returns\\" for fans of the first two Chris Reeve films. It's populist filmmaking at its best tackling a number of challenging themes within the entertaining package of a superhero fantasy. The bottom line go see it for yourself don't read all these reviews and if you don't like it leave midway through the movie and ask for your money back.

B000001G1E|5.0|\\"Star Time\\" is the perfect collection of James Brown's career-spanning musical output all in one place. Classic after classic is presented across four jam-packed discs. Might I add, most if not all are presented in their full unedited and uncut versions so for example with \\"Cold Sweat\\", you get both parts whereas some smaller collections will only give you part one. On these cuts you experience the rawness and the pure vitality of JB and his band. You get to hear some band members, notably saxophone players, improvise and James Brown talks to his band and tells them how he wants the next part of it to sound. What other band leader did that or does that? These guys showed a true sense of muscianship. Again, all the well-known classics are here as well as some songs you don't hear too often, as well as some alternate cuts like the full version of \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\", with JB saying \\"This is a hit\\" at the beginning and its presented how it was originally recorded before the tape was sped up and prepped for the 45. Cool! This is interesting, \\"Stoned to the Bone\\" on disc four might actually be \\"I Got A Good Thing\\" which came out at the same time. Whatever it is, it's funky stuff anyway, and this collection's got it. From JB's early days as a passionately bluesy pioneering artist to his get-down and get-funky years. The liner notes, essays, and the whole booklet is fantastic, and the track by track listing contains sessionographies and so much other interesting facts. So please, please, please get up offa that thing and add this amazing set to your collection. You'll be doing the popcorn, gettin' on the good foot, breakin' out in a cold sweat and doin' it to death. Ahhhhhh-ow!
B000EWBKK8|1.0|Extremely poor transfer.. quality is basically DVD level, but with added jerkiness from the transfer process. Do not purchase this version, get the DVD instead, or wait for a real transfer.
B000F3UAFC|1.0|This would have been a good movie were it not for Hunt and Johanssen.  They were so badly miscast that they distracted from every scene . . Hunt looked like she wanted to be somewhere else, and she just didn't have the right voice, the right inflections, the right anything.  Johanssen looked like a teeny-bopper wearing her mother's clothes . . she appeared so juvenile, so immature in this role that she was an embarrassment to watch.  This is one move that I would enjoy seeing if they could find the appropriate actresses for the two major roles . . . would it be asking too much to see British actesses in these parts or at least American actresses mature enough to give Oscar Wilde his due?  A terrible couple of hours.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|For me this is the best album of Slipknot so far. The two earlier albums is a little bit too hard, brutal and raw for me, they've got too heteful lyrics. This album is still very hard but a hole lot softer the the earlier releases. The album is good but not very good.
B0007GADZO|4.0|I had lost track of Steve Vai for a while....In the early 90's I bought \\"Passion and Warfare\\"(an instant classic!!)but I did not buy anything after that, cause I just felt so good with Passion and Warfare that I didn't want to be let down by his next releases. Deep inside, I must have thoght that might happen... <br />Well resently I stopped by sony's website, and I fell in love with the sound clips for this CD. I bought it, and I have been enchanted ever since! It's a different CD, but no disapointments. Some fans don't like Steve's singing, but what he sings here is ok. It won't hurt. This is a statement, and I can't wait to hear part 2 and 3 when they are released!
B000EPR7NE|5.0|The Book are amazing, The Movie is Nasty, but the Score as Spectacular, maestro Zimmer has Captured the Suspense and the escence of the History not of this movie.
B00005JOQS|3.0|The effects are good, of course, today's movies have that going for them so they are usually entertaining.  I'd even give this a mild recommendation for seeing at the movie house.<br /><br />That said I'd like to point out that the main decent performance comes from the enemy of Superman, Lex played by Spacey, which shouldn't be a suprise, the suprise is that their total on sceen time together is just a couple of minutes (out of an overly long two and a half hours).  That was a shame.<br /><br />The other shame was that the movie lacked real action between Superman and anything resembling a real fight, sure he saves the space shuttle, a plane, crowds of people from falling glass, etc., but the fight with an enemy, any enemy, seemed lacking.<br /><br />I think the intention here was to try and make more of the tension in the film between Lois and Superman, and there is a twist to the story which I won't spoil here, but I'm not sure that it was enough.  I think the last X-men film did a better job of combining the romance, tension, friendship, etc., with the battling, fighting and such.<br /><br />In any case I left the theater feeling a bit like \\"was that it?\\" and that it was a bit too long.
B000FGGE7C|4.0|dumb movie, colors are a little dark.. have to keep adjusting the tv's color profile.. weak surround sound. Some issues with the color shading in some heavily manipulated scenes. <br /> <br />All these things aside, it is a good transfer, in actual high def, and in a much better presentation.. 1.85:1, which fills the entire screen on my samsung high def dlp, compared to the more commong 2.40:1 which has black bars at the top and bottom.
0307263118|5.0|Why has no one mentioned how funny this book is? If one looks on page 145 there is the description of the elephants as being the creatures most unlike humans that can be imagined. Of all \\"land-bound creatures\\" if we look for \\"our very opposite, one would surely need look no further than the elephants.\\"  Then there is the description of \\"Bun\\" who was so fat that when she rose from a wicker chair it creaked with relief. And what about the \\"hot vigilance\\" with which the young narrator inspects his playmates' mother. All of these occurences, toward the close of the book, are redolent and memory provoking for the reader if one is inclined to want to write also.
B00005A46T|2.0|I can describe this album in 5 words. It's hard, raw, brutal, aggresiv and hateful. It's that brutal that it cuts in my bones everytime a listen to it, it's like a torture. <br />But I can recommend this for guys that like this sort of brutal music. But I don't know if I should keep this album or sell it, cause I liked it before, now im tired of it. It whas once in a period that I like this sort of music and I still do it, but this album is just too hard. There latest album from 2004 is a lot better then this. <br />
B000002JSN|5.0|to group this band with all the other junky heavy metallers is just absurd. metallica reigns the heavy metal scene, and they can't hold a candle to Led Zeppelin.  As for the CD, everyone loves Trampled Under Foot and Ten Years Gone(easily a top 10 Zep song).  But you'll probably like about 75% of the other material, 10 to 12 songs in all.  Most musicians today can't even muster up 3 decent tracks that together last as long as the ever infamous \\"Kashmir\\"--truely composeresque brilliancy. \\"In the Light\\" is just a notch below, but still delivers the oasis driven desert feel, mimicked in and by Jesus Christ Superstar.  \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is my current ringtone, featuring riffs that Les Paul wouldn't have minded copywriting.  You may find it repetative, but just listen to War's \\"Cicso Kid\\".
B0001I55OC|1.0|Wow....I was excited to see this movie when it first came to the theaters. However, I read the book before going to see the movie and was appalled to see just how badly they messed up the original storyline. They switched plotlines around, switched characters around, and the ending....definately not the same. If they had actually decided to follow the novel at all those who enjoyed this flick would have had their minds blown.
B00005JOVH|4.0|More entertaining that most comic book turned movie stories, it did suffer from some element of cheese.<br /><br />At least there was a good amount of fighting and action.<br /><br />Undoubtably there will be a spin-off movie featuring Wolverine, he is the character whose actions and screen prescence are most followed (and most enjoyable imo).<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this as a movie to go see at the theater to someone that hadn't first watched the other X-men films.  Certainly anyone that enjoyed the first two will want to see this one, and whether they enjoy it more or less, I'm not sure, probably it'll fall below expectations, but if you haven't see the first two, going to see this one now may be a bit too much.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is a masterful restarting of the Superman franchise.  While advancing the characters in surprising ways, particularly the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane, the film pays respectful homage to the 1978 classic Superman: the Movie.  Think of everything you liked about Richard Donner's film:  the quotable script, the mix of humor and spectacle, the antagonistic relationship between hero and villain, then amp it up.  Instead of one chunk of Kryptonite there is an island of it; instead of a glance of Noel Neill there is an important scene with her, instead of a near fatal accident/rescue with a helicopter, there is an entire jetliner at risk, etc.  Brandon Routh's interpretation of the Man of Steel and Clark are wonderfully similar in earnestness to Christopher's Reeve's, yet there is a subtlety in Routh's depiction of the very human Clark Kent, that is humorous without being cartoony.  The special effects are eye-popping and suspenseful.  The brutal treatment of Superman by Kevin Spacey's awesomely evil Lex Luthor is nearly terrifying.  Superman's unbelievable feats of strength are the stuff of new iconographic imagery.   The script by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris is well written and respectful with no cringe-inducing silliness.  The symphonic score remaking John Williams' music from the `70s is inspiring.  New characters like Lois's child Jason and her fiance Richard White are sensitively  played by Tristan Leabu and James Marsden, and Kate Bosworth's Lois has many of the film's best scenes. With stunning art direction and cinematography this a terrific and satisfying movie.  Superman's cape rippling in the wind is a thing of beauty and so is this movie. Routh and Singer should be proud.
B0000C23DO|5.0|In my opinion, only a handful of bands in history deserve a compilation that includes the words, \\"The Very Best of\\" in their title (to this day it is overused), but ignoring that fact, the Grateful Dead are certainly one of them. Here you get seventeen tracks, filling up almost 80 minutes of their music. When I first got this a couple of summers ago, I gave it a good listen and loved it. <br />Pros: <br />A lot of good things can be said about this CD. The music, compilation itself, artwork, photos, liner notes, etc. are all very well done. It even gives you a discography and complete list of band members! Talk about a good way to keep yourself busy for a while. They also give you an order form for Dead merchandise. <br />Cons: <br />In terms of the music, none, but then again, no complaints in general. Deadheads could probably think of a couple of tracks to add here (Dark Star, Wharf Rat) but if that was the case, this would have to lead to be a dual-disc compilation. Still, as a single-disc, this is near-perfect. <br /> <br />Standout/ Favorite Tracks Of Mine: <br />\\"Truckin'\\": Fantastic Dead track, filled with great music and lyrics, of course, one of the famous \\"American Beauty\\" tracks. What's ironic about this song is that while it's the opener here, it's the closing song on \\"AB\\", or so I believe. <br />\\"Touch of Grey\\": From one of their last albums, In The Dark (1987). Catchy, with a landscape of instruments and very psychedelic lyrics. That may not come to a surprise, considering ITD was released after Jerry Garcia was in the hospital, in a coma (which possibly explains the album title/cover) <br />\\"Sugar Magnolia\\": It's too bad I never listen to this song much, anymore, because it's great. Seems to be a laid-back free man's love song with some very contrasting yet awesome lyrics, one of the Dead's shortest songs here, too, at 3:17. <br />\\"Casey Jones\\": From \\"Workingman's Dead\\". Great track, of course. I love the buildup of the instruments when the chorus isrepeated four times out in the end. The lyrics here are certainly those that speak for the Dead's lifestyle and way of adventure. \\"Drivin' that train/ High on cocaine/ Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed/ Trouble ahead, trouble behind/ And you know that notion just crossed my mind\\". <br />\\"Uncle John's Band: A mellow, acoustic song apparently about being in a band with an almost father-like uncle. A very memorable song. <br />\\"Friend of the Devil\\": Another really good song, but the combination of acoustic guitar/thumping bass is a strange combo. The lyrics are quite diverse and seem to be the narration of the life of a \\"friend of the devil\\". <br />\\"Franklin's Tower\\": I love how the chorus just repeats \\"Roll away...the dew\\" and the whole song has a nice feel to it. <br />\\"Estimated Prophet\\": An eclectic pop song. The wa-wa guitar riff is very jolly and the type of melody that you'd whistle while walking down the street. However, the lyrics are very different for a Dead song. When you look beyond the \\"California... preaching on the burning shore\\" and \\"Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine\\" this song is very dark, especially the first verse: \\"My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no.\\" At any rate, it's still an excellent song. <br />\\"Eyes of the World\\": All right! Now HERE'S a song I can talk about. This is a great summer song, it features wonderful jams, mystical lyrics and is overall unforgettable. Reminds me of a place that seems unfamiliar to anywhere else I've been to. I don't even know where it is, but it's beautiful. Actually, it also reminds me of a playground I used to go to long ago. This song brings up great memories and fantasies, and on top of it all, has a great riff in between lines, along with some great bass-guitar work towards the end. <br />\\"The Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion\\": A huge standout, barely over two minutes. This was from their debut album, featuring experimental,acid-like ditties, zippy tempos and covers of old jazz and blues tunes done really well. Anyway, this song, their first recorded, is a classic, and is overall very good. <br />\\"One More Saturday Night\\": A live performance from \\"Euorpe 72\\" with great guitar and piano work, and a psychedelic version of that cliched 50's rhythm. Great live anthem. <br />\\"The Music Never Stopped\\": Not weird, but certainly different from alot of other songs. Another great summer track, a jazzy anthem featuring a sax and Donna Godchaux singing a few lines. This is the only song on this compilation to have so on it. <br />\\"Hell in a Bucket\\": A bit of a more uptempo song and a slightly heavier beat. I really like this song all-around and the lyrics, like \\"Touch of Grey\\" suit the \\"In The Dark\\" album. <br />\\"Ripple\\": Here's a song I hear plenty of talk from. Deadheads would often say it just isn't the same without leading into \\"Brokedown Palace\\", but the single version is also excellent in my opinion. A sensetive, folky, acoustic song with very reflective lyrics. This is a type of song that should typically close out any album (a song that's deep and gentler, even if the whole album is zippy and wild). <br /> <br />Overall: <br />So, as I finalize this review, I know I may have rambled on (in text) to you about these songs, but it may as well be worth it. The Grateful Dead have left a legacy behind, and Jerry Garcia (along with original keyboardist Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan) have left us much too soon. Not wanting to lean onto that topic too much, I just want to finish up by saying that this is a great compilation for - A: Grateful Dead music B: A venture into new territories (if you're new to the Dead and/or psychedelic rock in general, of which the Grateful Dead is one of the greatest bands) and C: A great summer soundtrack. So what are you waiting for? Getting this album is totally worth it, in fact, I wish I could be able to listen to the Grateful Dead for the very first time again. It was something I know I'll never forget.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Obsession for music covers many boundaries- to be the first to unearth (and tell a friend) - to frustrate and annoy those that just don't get it (comfortable in your own self belief)- and to compare artists to others. Like a wine maker describing boquet or the person whose job it is to give adjectives to colors of paint. So for my comparison to end all let's just say Band of Horses sounds like Supertramp having spent a week in a caravan with The Red House Painters. There I've said it- but you know what? Music has objectivity and many will disagree- most important however is that we're listening to it- and we're loving it- they have something special and really that's all that matters.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Right now this is my standard by which to measure great film, and this edition showcases it beautifully. There is no incidental material on these two disks- all the extras contribute to the experience of the movie. All aspects of the production, from the biography of the man on whom it is based to the process of developing the soundtrack receive deserved attention. There are actually 2 separate feature-length commentaries- one from the director and the other from the writer with  very little redundacy. The viewer is left feeling that there is plenty more material out there. <br />  <br />This is a powerful film which speaks volumes on its own. The special features serve not to plunder the film, but rather suggest additionallevels on which the production can be appreciated. There are so many elements in this movie that the genius of the propmasters, special effects team, costume& makeup need to be examined individually to appreciate the incredible craftsmanship involved.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|First of all I must say this is by far the best Clooney movie I've seen, hands down. From the beginning to the end you will be at the edge of your seat. This is a very complex movie, but so is what's happening in our world. You have to be in the right state of mind to appreciate it. The beauty of the DVD is that you can always rewind if you don't get it. If you believe everything you read and like Fox news, please don't waste your time  you will never get it. But then again you may finally wake up.
0767834739|4.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse has made some big changes ever since the first Resident Evil and trust me they are worth seeing. This movie is full of scary parts and humorous moments and great action sequences that trust me you will never forget. I was a little disappointed though on how this movie was not as scary and sinister as the first But many people jumped at many various parts of the movie including me.  <br /> <br />Alot people have been talking about the zombies lately. I would have to say they were not scary...they seemed to be alot weaker as if you could push them over. I took it as kind of a joke and sometimes it makes you want to take pictures of the zombies then laugh later. But new creatures have emerged and are even more sinister like the \\"Nemesis\\" and the \\"licker\\".  <br /> <br />Second the addition of \\"Jill Valentine\\" was simply very intelligent but you did not get to see her in full action. She was a little too much of the \\"sidekick\\" but you do see her kicking zombie [...]!!!  <br /> <br />The visuals were amazing. The story was very good and you always wonder what will happen next. There is also the addition of new humorous moments that make you laugh by a new actor in the movie. The fight scenes were GREAT. THIS IS DEFINELTY A MUST HAVE!!!!!! <br />
B00005JP0A|3.0|The rarified, oxygen-deprived world of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is one in which very few people survive: blood sucking vampires, ravers, drug peddlers and those involved in the Fashion Industry.<br />Director David Frankel, heretofore most famous for the Woody-Allenish, Sarah Jessica Parker-starring \\"Miami Rhapsody,\\" does a good job of setting the tone of entitlement and bulimia in his \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" which stars a macho, gut crunching and proud to be a *itch Meryl Streep as fashion/lifestyle magazine editor Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Miranda's intelligent, not interested in fashion but needing a job/ gofer-slave Andy Sachs.<br />Andy, very much the innocent /stranger in a strange land arrives on Miranda's doorstep as a last resort after graduating from Northwestern University...turned down everywhere else she applies at \\"Runway Magazine\\" hoping to begin her career in Journalism. Andy is surprisingly (to herself and to us) hired as Miranda's second assistant: a job that everyone tells her \\"several 1000 girls would give their eye-teeth for.\\"<br />Andy is subjected to a number of humiliating and challenging situations and by whit of her innate intelligence and talent manages to solve and/or survive all.<br />Streep plays Miranda as if her life depends on it: she is ferocious, haughty, smart and completely dedicated to her job and as Andy comments during the film: \\"If Miranda were a man, no one would make a comment about her drive for perfection.\\" (paraphrase). There is one scene in which Miranda lets her hair down emotionally with Andy but the scene seems contrived to add another tone (a \\"female\\" one)to Miranda's character. Again the director should have left well enough alone, stuck by his character's basic nature and celebrated the strong, powerful woman that Miranda is.<br />If only \\"TDWP\\" as a whole had the steely resolve of Streep's Miranda we might have had an important as well as a mildly amusing film on our hands. But as it is, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a fun but ultimately shallow/missed the opportunity to make an important statement film.but ultimately shallow/missed the opportunity to make an important statement film.
1592401791|4.0|Much of what Emerick had to say was insightful and very entertaining. I'm a huge Beatles' fan. I was glued to the book and couldn't wait to get home from work to read it. <br /> <br />I did, however,  skip over some of the material at the beginning of the book that mostly dealt with Emerick's personal career situation. I was not interested in how he became an engineer at EMI, nor about his schooling.  <br /> <br />Once the story of how he started working with the Beatles began unfolding, first by replacing the Beatles original engineer, and his recording of Revolver, the book became a fantastic read.   <br /> <br />For anyone who is a Beatles' fan, this is a great book! I recommend it highly.

B0000009RT|5.0|Stick Brian Wilson in a muppet sock inside a corpse that's hanging from a bungee cord; let's go talk to the extras and see what jo schmo's got to say about whatever drug is in fashion. Let's all go into the bathroom and finger our chakras. Hold your breath and stare into the mirror, all crisp, tight light and shining nerves, hot breath on your chest, in your cage, lowered down with the sea monsters and washing the car. Blast me into the incorporeal past! Xylophone sticks splintering in my spine, bongos rattling in my gills, cheese trails flying from my dog's jowls in the front-side passenger seat. My skull's frontpiece has daggered split ends and I'm drooling inside my fur suit, bug-eyed for some killer spray and babbling in the beach blanket bingo lingo. Glistery muscles budding from spires of iron, licking the breath off my chest. Weird cyclones blistering from my cheek, making my reflection go watery and steep, flying up out of the sky, a fissure of steam lacing the air. Bumble bee hairnets and bubblewrap nail casings. My throat is a canvas of digestible gases in disrepair, slippery and ripe.
B0002IQNAG|1.0|You'd have to be a zombie to consider this excruciatingly long, badly paced, terribly acted, repetitive, ridiculous and horrifyingly unscary chore of a movie as entertainment. <br /> <br />\\"A scathing indictment of 20th century consumerism\\" proclaim the critics. \\"A horror classic\\" scream the fan-boys. \\"Shoddily made balderdash\\" say I. <br /> <br />Where's the build-up? Where's the apocalyptic atmosphere? Where's the horror, for Pete's sake? You can't expect anyone with any sense to be amused by the irony of a homicidal Hare Krishna one minute, then be genuinely shocked by offal-munching extras the next. <br /> <br />It must be true that Hell must have been full for a while in 1978, because not only did the dead walk the Earth, they managed to get their clammy hands on some inferior movie-making equipment.  <br />
0689825498|5.0|It really holds my daughters interest.  Pictures are simple and clear.  The story is cute and easy enough for a toddler to understand.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|...which has to be applauded. The previous efforts , Six Degrees... and Train of Thought are indeed married as Octavarium. Musically speaking, here we have a happy medium of a prog-hard rock punch and bone-crushing metal.     Lyrically, DT continues to delve into personal struggle and darkness eventually leading to light, as in \\"These Walls\\". Octavarium is not the strongest of their previous efforts lyrically, but solid. (This still says much considering the mindless lyrics out here in the music realm for the most part)     Besides \\"These Walls\\", the post 9-11 reaction of \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" are my choice Octa cuts because of the musical equilibrium achieved in both. DT is most brilliant and exciting creating the slow-paced, prog-laced atmosphere with thunder metal. The DT guys deny part of themselves when too mesmerized with their technicalities.    More on \\"Sacrified Sons\\", to say that that its too far removed from 9/11 is a bit rash. An event so permanently imprinted and thought-provoking will continously inspire artists. Somehow, SS manages to sound (dare I say? Yes...)\\"pretty\\" while being about such an ugly event and even with the progressively metal riffs in the middle and towards the end of the song. Throughout the track, the symphonic background accompanies the band just right. This masterpiece does not drag out like a 10 min song, even though it is about this long.    All right, now here's a long defense of Track 4. Criticism over the easiness of \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is understandable for the sake of arguments brought up by the extreme metalheads and proggers alike. Yet, in a different light, one can find some cleverness in this song. DT prove their musical mastery in still creating complexity in a song that easy on the ears as pop. Once again, DT succeeds in balance. Though reminiscent of U2 as widely deemed, DT is not ripping Bono and the guys off and most top 40 artists could not pull off this song which is DT's own terms. There are plenty enough ultimate mindtripping, thought-provoking songs by the band. Throwing in a love song or two with power adds to dimension. Maybe DT is shedding to us some wit as well. It's quite amusing to have a song like this followed by the undeniable headbanger of \\"Panic Attack\\".  This occurance is reminiscent of the gospel acoustic ballad \\"Through Her Eyes\\" followed by one of DT's most heaviest songs, Home, on Metropolis 2:Scenes from a Memory.    For those who like some variety in compelling hard rock n roll, Octavarium will be an absolute delight. The best thing about this effort is that it grows favorably on the listener. With all that DT is bringing forth, take some time to consume the musicial feast and eventually, you will truly \\"get it\\"!
B000FILW86|5.0|This is the best CD Cheap Trick has released in years.  Robin Zander's vocals are excellent, Rick plays lots of fabulous hooks, Bun E. rocks on the drums, and Tom absolutely shines on the bass.  When listening to this CD, I skip no tracks--I listen to each and every song. Yes, this CD is that good! Honestly, they are all good tracks, and well worth the cost of the CD.  <br />This CD combines both rock and power pop! <br />My particular faves:  Come On, Come On, Come On, (rockin tune..makes you want to get up and dance... Welcome to the world (first track, great start to the CD...) <br />Oh Claire (Robin is fantastic in this ballad, has a beatlesque quality to it), and \\"This time you got it\\", another rockin tune with a chorus that will linger in your head long after you hear it, \\"Give it away\\" is another smokin' tune...\\"Decaf\\" is the last track on the CD and brings the CD to a close with a rocking bang.... <br />This CD lives up to the great reviews it's been receiving.  Still not convinced?  Take a listen to some of the sound clips....Cheap Trick has still got it after all these years!!! <br /> <br />Great release, and excellent job Cheap Trick, Thanks!!!
0446677450|4.0|Mr. Kiyosaki explains the problems with our society's current paradyms of money, success and creating wealth. How we are currently in the \\"Rat Race\\" and do not know how to break out of the race. <br /> <br />Once I started reading this book at the local bookshop I couldn't put it down, so I bought it. I was amazed at how simple Robert's principles are, they are things that everyone is capable of seeing through to the end. The entire book is summed up by \\"the No 1 rule, the only rule\\". I now look at my possessions in a different light that is worthless devaluing pieces of junk. Robert not only tells the reader what he/she should be spending their hard earned cash on but how to do it.  <br /> <br />The book is very user friendly. I felt as if I was talking to Robert on a one to one basis. After reading this book you will become an authority on its teachings. <br />
0805047905|5.0|I love this book because it has a repeating theme.  It's perfect for children, because we all know kids learn from repetition.
B00005JP0A|5.0|As usual, Meryl Streep delivers a most excellent performance. Also Anne Hathaway was very likeable and I think she did a great job. While Meryl plays the demanding Editor-in-Chief, Miranda Priestly, of a top-notch fashion magazine, she is not really as devlish as the title may indicate -- there are certainly far worse bosses around. Still, in a sense it's a type of comedy, but also with some serious undertones like e.g. dedicating your life to a professional career may ruin your personal life. <br />Stanley Tucci is also superb -- too bad that he's so underrated. Tucci is an excellent actor and I wish he would show up in more films. <br />This movie is certainly an enjoyable flick and it also gives some insight into the subjective and egocentric fashion business, but overall it's not to be taken too serious and it's even a spoof in some way. It's really a fun film and the quality acting really makes this film well worth watching.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Excellent move that should have won both the Oscar! Not being a huge Johnny Cash fan I wasn't sure about this film, but being a HUGE Reese Witherspoon fan I was compelled to see it and I am glad I did!  This is an excellent movie with Oscar winning performances by both actors.  If Joaquin had not been against Copete, he would have won because he was Johnny in person and up close.  I can't believe they even sang!  Incredible!  This movie is one you just can't miss.  You don't feel sorry for Johnny as I thought they might try to portray, you understand him and June better.  Great movie.
0736063684|5.0|We originally got this book from the library.  We had gotten many weight training and information books and none compared to this book.  It is a great resource.  I love the illustrations that help you see which muscles are worked with each exercise.  If you find you want to concentrate on a certain area, it is easy to look up since it is well organized.  If you are to only have one book for Strength Training, this is it.
1563890119|3.0|Neil Gaiman introduces his spiritual entity of Dream aka \\"The Sandman\\" in this first of ten volumes. Gaiman himself admits to not feeling comfortable with the series until the last issue in the trade and it truly shows. Although decent and well written the beginning to this acclaimed series falls short of the expectations set by the following stories. However, this volume does set up others in the series well and I couldn't recommend skipping it.
B00005JOSS|5.0|I was dragged almost kicking and screaming to this thinking it would be a chick-flick (do we still use that expression?) but the special trick (that my wife caught before I did -- hey! She had read about the movie and picked it!) -- really made it an interesting puzzle. I found myself saved from just watching a romance by having the chance to wonder about time, sequencing, and whether the ending could make sense -- I am not sure it does. The one event should still have gone well if the end was right but then that would have ruined the movie. It was enjoyable though I did find myself annoyingly close to tears several times without knowing why! Too much estrogen in my food? Are movies getting really good at using music to make us feel sad when the director wants us to? (I noticed the DaVinci Code had the same effect.) In any case, I recommend the movie to any husband that might not normally want to suffer through a chick-flick -- your wife will love it -- but it is interesting enough to keep you going too. If she asks to go, take her. If she drags you along -- don't kick or scream! It will be OK.
B000002OMN|5.0|We all know who Meat Loaf is. If it weren't for his smashing 1977 debut album, BAT OUT OF HELL, Meat Loaf would be virtually unknown. In 1993, after seven years since his 1986 album, BLIND BEFORE I STOP, Meat Loaf released the album BAT OUT OF HELL II: BACK INTO HELL, the smashing sequel to his 1977 predecessor. I was always pretty fond of Meat Loaf's music, but this album just turned me from a minor fan to a major fan. This album, which is my favorite Meat Loaf album, is spectacular.    I'D DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE (BUT I WON'T DO THAT)    The first single from the album. This song was the first song I had heard from Meat Loaf, back in 1993. Since the time of this single's release, I have loved this song. This song is extremely powerful in its music and lyrics. Now, the version we've all heard on the radio was well over five minutes, which is not enough time to enjoy this powerful song. The video version ran to a mere 7:40 (7 minutes, 40 seconds). Enough time to enjoy the song, but still not enough, for even the video version of the song was still not in its entirety. This album version is the full-length version that runs to an exact 12:00 (12 minutes). Yeah, it is a long song, but it is worth the whole 12:00, for this song is just one of the all-time best from Meat Loaf. Now, the female vocalist in the song was only credited as Mrs. Loud. Mrs. Loud's real name is Lorraine Crosby. But for her appearence in the video (which has a Francis Ford Coppola \\"Dracula\\" concept to it), Meat Loaf hired the beautiful actress, Dana Patrick, who also appeared in Meat Loaf's video for \\"I'd Lie For You (And That's The Truth)\\". This song was such a huge hit, that it shot straight to #1 in 28 different countries, including the U.S. (Billboard Hot 100). Now, people are always asking, \\"What is it that he WILL do for love? What is it that he WON'T do for love?\\" Well, it's about time you all know what it is he will do and won't do for love:    DO's:  He'll run right into Hell and back. He'll be there till the final act. He'll take a vow and seal the pact. He'll do anything you've been dreaming of. He'll raise up, he'll help you down. He'll get you right out of this God-forsaken town. He'll make it feel a little less cold. He'll hold you sacred, he'll hold you tight. He'll colorize your life, since you're so tired of black and white. He'll make it all a little less old. He'll make you some magic with his own two hands. He'll build an emerald city with those grains of sand. He'll give you something that you can take home. He'll cater to every fantasy you have. He'll hose you down with Holy water if you get too hot. He'll take you places you've never known.  DON'T's:  He'll never lie to you and that's a fact. He'll never forget the way you feel right now. He'll never forgive himself if you two don't go all the way tonight. He'll never allow any turning back. He'll never do it better than he does it with you. He'll never stop dreaming of you every night of his life. After awhile, he'll never forget everything. He'll see that it's still not the time to move on. He'll never let it turn to dust and let you and he fall down. He'll never be screwing around. There you have it: plain and simple.    LIFE IS A LEMON AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK    This 8:00 (8 minute) song is just a rock out classic for me. I love the heaviness in the guitars and drums. Great song.    ROCK AND ROLL DREAMS COME THROUGH    The second single from the album. This 5:50 (5 minute, 50 second) song is another classic.    IT JUST WON'T QUIT    A 7:21 (7 minute, 21 second) classic.    OUT OF THE FRYING PAN (AND INTO THE FIRE)    This is another great classic tune, running at 7:24.    OBJECTS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MAY APPEAR CLOSER THAN THEY ARE    The third single from the album. This 10:15 ballad is just pure amazing. The piano in the song fits very well to the song's story. Seems as though that Jim Steinman (who has written each song on this album) has a tendency to write songs that extremely long. He has written \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" (performed by Celine Dion) (a 7:37 tune), \\"Total Eclipse Of The Heart\\" (performed by Bonnie Tyler), (a 7:01 tune), \\"Holding Out For A Hero\\" (performed by Bonnie Tyler) (a 5:50 tune), and many others that were very long. Not only were Jim Steinman-penned tunes extremely long, but they were also major hits for many artists.    WASTED YOUTH (Poem)    Performed by Jim Steinman. Jim Steinman is the voice behind this creepy and graphic poem.    EVERYTHING LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE    Great.    GOOD GIRLS GO TO HEAVEN (BAD GIRLS GO EVERYWHERE ELSE)    Great.    BACK INTO HELL (Instrumental)     A Creepy-As-Hell instrumental piece.    LOST BOYS AND GOLDEN GIRLS    This is a great ballad, and one of the shortest songs on here. This song only runs to 4:28. Two other songs on here run just over 2:00, and they are \\"Wasted Youth\\" and \\"Back Into Hell\\".        This is one of Meat Loaf's greatest masterpieces. I have been listening to this CD ever since I bought. That only goes to show you that this album is just amazing. I'm hoping that BAT OUT OF HELL III will be as great as BAT OUT OF HELL and this here first sequel.
B000002UB3|5.0|There are so many reviews here, some of which are more politically motivated than they may realize, I will be brief.  Praise for this album is profuse.  Pseudo-Punks please note that the 1960s, nor the \\"hippies,\\" nor the BEATLES, are your enemy, but, in fact, your model.  Those who claim to \\"hate\\" the BEATLES are simply refusing to listen.  Please re-read if you fail to agree, for my words are spare.<br /><br />For those who know better, this is the BEATLES greatest achievement; despite those sentimental and gorgeous George Harrison tunes some might complain about (\\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\") I'm not one of the complainers.  Richard Starkey's fluffy entry (\\"Octopus' Garden\\") only contributes.  It all works perfectly together, proving that this band not only wrote brilliant tunes, but with their producer George Martin, arranged and produced perfectly, and in the process, changed music forever.  Like it or not, this is the BEATLES' swansong, and best effort, and they love you.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|This album rocks!!! I think American Witch is the only song that has the typical zombie sound. That's definetely not a bad thing!! Alot of creative stuff on here, my favorite song is The Scorpion Sleeps. I think it's one of the stand out songs on here that brings out a new Zombie, very cool rhythms. Even if I weren't familiar with Rob Zombie I would still picture demonic sesame street monsters dancing to it. It's a really great album if you like rob zombie or just really creative music.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Look at my review for the movie soundtrack.  I had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie, but my mom sold it.  I hate that fact, but there isn't a thing I can do about it.  I wish I could get one back.
B000FA57RG|5.0|On June 20th, 2006, Madonna had released her seventeenth album entitled, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A SECRET. This album, a live album I might add, is the soundtrack to Madonna's second tour documentary of the same name, and this album is pure amazing. Both the documentary and this live album (which both appear here) are of Madonna's sixth 2004 world tour: THE RE-INVNETIONG TOUR. I doubt any of you Madonna fans out there will be disappointed. I am in no way near being disappointed in this album.     THE BEAST WITHIN  From the single JUSTIFY MY LOVE (1990). This was the opening number of the concert, featuring a video of Madonna in different images of a video entitled, X-Static Process, the same title of a track on Madonna's album, AMERICAN LIFE, in which The Re-Invention Tour supported. This is a great track and it is one of the remixes of Madonna's ninth #1 hit, \\"Justify My Love.    VOGUE  From the album I'M BREATHLESS (1990). Madonna had officially opened the show with this classic hit tune. Coming out of the bottom of the stage, dressed in a white corset (blue in the U.K. and some U.S. shows), black shorts, knee-length stillettos, complete with an 1800s French-styled ponytail. Amazing performance.    NOBODY KNOWS ME  From the album AMERICAN LIFE (2003). Great performance.    AMERICAN LIFE  From the album AMERICAN LIFE (2003). The way she fused the album version together with the Headcleanr Rock Mix of this classic 2003 hit was just brilliant. Awesome song. This performance was started with the sound of war and helicopter sounds, with television sets wheeled out on stage. Madonna enters the stage wearing army fatigues (can we say, \\"Cause we are living in a military world and she is a military girl\\") and performs this amazing song.    HOLLYWOOD (Remix)  Original version from the album AMERICAN LIFE (2003). This was actually a dancers interlude, where Madonna was changing outfits. All the dancers, in front of 1920s French-like circus set, dance to different variations (representing national heritages or talents) of this song.    DIE ANOTHER DAY  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack, DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002). This song, with Madonna dressed up as 1920s circus vamp, was performed brilliantly, where Madonna and each male dancer had danced the tango, where she ended the song as being strapped into the electric chair by her dancers.    LAMENT  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack, EVITA (1996). After being strapped in the chair, Madonna sings this beautiful ballad, with so much passion, as if she were still trying to portray the infamous Argentinan leader, Eve Duarte de Perone. Great performance. If you hadn't noticed this yet, the original album version was sung by both Madonna and Antonio Banderas. In this performance, Madonna only sings her verse of the song, and the rest of the song just plays out instrumentally.    LIKE A PRAYER  From the album LIKE A PRAYER (1989). This song, with Madonna dressed in a black vest, black slacks, high-heels, and a hair-net, is nothing less than perfect. Madonna calls this song, \\"...The No-Sitting-Down Song...\\". Great performance of this 1989 classic.    MOTHER AND FATHER  From the album AMERICAN LIFE (2003). This was a great song and it was performed brilliantly with a few lines of \\"Intervention\\", a song that was also featured on Madonna's 2003 album, AMERICAN LIFE.    IMAGINE  Originally recorded and performed by John Lennon. Madonna had decided to include this on the tour's setlist, for she felt (and still feels) that we all need to end all this hatred and start bringing peace into this world. Madonna performs John Lennon's hit so beautifully, that I well up everytime I hear it.    SUSAN MacLEOD/INTO THE GROOVE  \\"Into The Groove\\" from the original motion picture DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN (1985). The intro for this song was started by a Scotish band, complete with bagpipes, leading Madonna to enter the stage, wearing a black & white flannel kilt, and a (COUNTRY HERITAGE) Do It Better black-tee. This is a great song and Madonna, with the GAP Choruses, complete with Missy Elliott's on-screen appearance, make this performance a spectacle. Just so you know, in the first month or two of the tour, the black-tee Madonna wore read, KABBALISTS Do It Better. Her Philly shows had her wearing ITALIANS Do It Better. Her Britain shows had her wearing BRITS Do It Better. Her Ireland shows had her wearing IRISH Do It Better, and so forth.    MUSIC  From the album MUSIC (2000). With a DJ in a club-lighting pyramid, Madonna, with so much energy, performs this club-techno smash hit. Love it.    HOLIDAY  From the album MADONNA (1983). A song from the album that started it all. Madonna, for the first time, performed this song with a completely different arrangement. The arrangement in this performance is just pure amazing and it does nothing but get me up off my a** to dance.    I LOVE NEW YORK (Rock Version)  This was an early version of the song that is now on Madonna's 2005 album, CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR. This song was not done live on The Re-Invention Tour. It was put here, for it was included on the documentary.    Now, some of the songs were taken out from the whole CD. Those songs that were left off of the CD were: \\"Frozen\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Hanky Panky\\", \\"Deeper And Deeper\\", \\"Bedtime Story (Video Interlude)\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", & \\"Crazy For You\\". But this CD is just pure amazing. This is a great buy. Below is the tour's full setlist.    MADONNA: THE RE-INVENTION TOUR 2004 Setlist:    Video Introduction: THE BEAST WITHIN  VOGUE  NOBODY KNOWS ME  FROZEN  AMERICAN LIFE  EXPRESS YOURSELF  BURNING UP  MATERIAL GIRL  Dancers Interlude: HOLLYWOOD (Remix)  HANKY PANKY  DEEPER AND DEEPER  DIE ANOTHER DAY  LAMENT  Video Interlude: BEDTIME STORY  NOTHING FAILS  DON'T TELL ME  LIKE A PRAYER  MOTHER AND FATHER (with a few lines of \\"Intervention\\")  IMAGINE  INTO THEGROOVE (with bagpipes introduction, & with Missy Elliott on video backdrop)  PAPA DON'T PREACH (wih \\"American Life\\" reprise)  CRAZY FOR YOU  MUSIC  HOLIDAY
B000EMGAGW|1.0|I'll tell you why people are hating on this album. Because 50 cent took a great rap group and attached strings to them. This stuff is straight up garbage. Go get MASTA KILLA - MADE IN BROOKLYN or GZA/MUGGS GRANDMASTERS. and you will see what real hip hop is. And what the F**k is that snap music. Its looks like a rap version of a hoe down............YEE HA  <br /> <br />I cant believe rap has gotten to this level. There is only one group that can heal the scars and that is the WU!!!!!!
0553213105|4.0|This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation.  In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show! It's charming, witty, and unique. I love the balance of her being a Mom, Wife, and having a very important job. That would be a boring premise for a show, except her job is so unusual and fascinating. Plus, it's strange and funny that her Husband would be a Math freak (engineer?), and the last person who would believe in psychic ability if not for her. Every episode is a puzzle, and you get to put the pieces together as they do, it's surprisingly NOT predictable! I absolutely hate t.v. except for this show. Patricia Arquette is amazing! I think it would be hard to play a convincing psychic! It's no wonder she won an Emmy!
6305388458|1.0|Despite the fact that this is an awesome and humorous movie (The best monty python ever made). This gets a 1 from me for having no subtitles or close captioning since I am hard of hearing. Are there any versions with subtitles??
B00009Y3L4|4.0|It's rare when one finds a movie that's enjoyable even when the main characters are boring and the plot entirely mediocre.  Sally Bowles, an Oscar-winning Liza Minelli, is a good singer, but not an interesting or endearing character.  Brian Roberts, a thoroughly boring Michael York, never succeeds in being anything but bland.  The two love stories aren't particularly engaging...so why did I enjoy this movie so much?<br /><br />For one, Joel Gray is incredible as the Master of Ceremonies.  His character is never seen as doing anything except performing (he never has is even named) and what a performance it is.  The movie kicked into a higher level when he was on screen, though part of that credit should probably go to Bob Fosse for choreographing the Cabaret sequences.  I particularly enjoyed how the song and dance numbers paralleled (or perhaps mirrored) the action in the movie.  Think of \\"Two Ladies\\" while Brian and Max compete for Sally's attention, or perhaps \\"If You Could See Her\\" while Fritz and Natalia are courting.  Furthermore, it was refreshing to see a musical in which all the music didn't strain the credibility of the viewer.  Watching West Side Story, it's hard to imagine that these tough-as-nails Jets would really be throwing each other up in the air or snapping their fingers while singing.  Most musicals require suspending disbelief, but in this one all the music came at the Cabaret (except for \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,\\" which was also entirely believable)<br /><br />Lastly, it would be impossible to omit how subtly and wonderfully the rise of Nazism is portrayed.  While Brian gets beaten up by the SA, most of the Nazi rise to power is depicted slowly and steadily.  The last shot of the film perfectly finished the trajectory, and if you're thinking of Sally and Brian as the credits roll then you viewed the film differently than I did.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|I like a story different than the traditional cookie-cutter plots, so I can't give it just one star. But the movie was boring - you have to really pay attention and figure out what is going on, otherwise you just watch and very little seems to make coherent sense. That is, there are several plotlines running at once and you are trying to figure out how they are connected - by the time the movie is over you have an idea, but then it's too late to be involved with any of the characters because you haven't figured out to have sympathy for. Of course, all the big oil guys are bad guys, which is typical hollywood - governments = good, corporations = bad. Yet, if you think about it, evil corporations kill many fewer people than evil governments and are far easier to overthrow. I don't recommend this movie - I regret renting it.
B00005JP0A|3.0|The cinematic version of The Devil Wears Prada was a joy to watch. The theater was filled with couples of allraces,  genders and orientations. Even straight men, there with their girlfriends, laughed at all of the appropriate moments. This is a \\"chick flick\\" without the sickly sweet aftertaste of the majority of films slapped with that demeaning chick flick moniker. The Devil Wears Prada retains the bitter bite of the movie's \\"Devil,\\" editrix Miranda Priestly.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays fresh-out-of-college Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs as the idealistic journalist the way you would imagine a Northwestern journalism grad to be. As so sharply pointed out by Stanley Tucci's character, fashion editor Nigel, Andrea feels that working at the fashion magazine Runway is beneath her training and intelligence. She's only there because one year as Miranda Priestly's assistant will guarantee her a spot at any of the more \\"literary\\" magazines in New York City.<br /><br />So desperate for that big break, Andy spends every waking moment as Miranda's handmaiden appeasing her most bizarre whims. She sells her soul to the job, leaving friendships, family, and a very cute boyfriend twisting in the wind. Everyone sympathizes with Andy, but don't understand why she continues to allow herself to be abused. Andy knows but is afraid to say it. It is because she wants to be successful. As the movie follows Andy down her career path, we realize that Andy is as fierce and as competitive as Miranda when it comes to her career. Who is the real devil in this movie? Is it Miranda Priestly who knows what she is and plays to win at all costs? Or is it Andy who pretends she has no choice to do what she does to get ahead?<br /><br />Meryl Streep deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination as the cold, berating, insulting, patronizing, condescending, back-stabbing, anal retentive editor Miranda Priestly. With her asymmetrical silver-haired bob and air of superiority, anyone within 100 feet of her should be both duly impressed and scared. Even when Streep allows the bitch-editor to reveal her humanity, we never feel sorry for her. Why? Because Miranda doesn't want it and you better not give it.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is a whirlwind of Manhattan scenery, top shelf wardrobes, pretty men, good music, and stunningly beautiful fashion. Half-way through the movie, my eyes were as wide as Andy's black-rimmed doe ones. My heart was in my throat as they flashed the montage of Paris Fashion Weeks' top runway shows. I was envious. It was at that moment that I understood what fashion is as Miranda sees it. It is a fantasy land to the outsiders, and they long to be in the positions of Miranda and Andy.<br /><br />I tried to read the novelby Lauren Wiesberger in preparation of the film. Reportedly, the book is based on her experiences as Anne Wintour's assistant at Vogue magazine. The book was overwritten, tedious, and exhausting. I lost my patience of wading through for the conclusion at 250 pages with about 100 to go. The movie was significantly retooled, and is a faster and smoother story.

0451191153|4.0|I apologize for using such a tired phrase to begin my review but cliches do have their use and I think this particular one perfectfully sums up my feelings on Ayn Rand's treatise.  If I break down pros and cons, which I will do in a moment, the latter far outweighs the former.  This review assumes the reader has read the book and thus will give away some aspects of the novel's plot.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Ellsworth Toohey.  Masterfully written, marvelously scheming, and a wonderful villain.  His picture of the future was as ominous as the one espoused by Orwell's O'Brien, and his obsession with power fascinating.<br /><br />Peter Keating. Despite being a fairly unsympathetic character he is by far the most beleiveable and his fall from grace has true pathos.<br /><br />Gail Wynand.  Something of a cross between Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey, Wynand represented one of the most interesting of the book's characters: the man who could have been.  His obsession with power (I Do) was quite intersting to read, especially when he finds out how little he has--a man who has become popular by lying can't suddenly begin telling the truth.<br /><br />The First Act.  Almost a story in and of itself, Part 1 (\\"Peter Keating\\") juxtaposes two men who are completely driven to success in their own ways, and ends with the amoral one succeeding fabulously while the principled one fails miserably.  The most complete part of the book.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Unbelieveable Characters.  Wynand/Toohey/Howard Roark/Dominique Francon are too smart.  They always seem to know exactly what the other is thinking despite their roundabout, baffling ways of thinking.  The relationship between the latter two never makes sense to anyone but Ayn Rand.<br /><br />Idealism vs. reality.  Roark and Dominique presented as hero and heroine, the ideal people, but they're stubborn, cold people who can be exceptionally cruel at times.<br /><br />Rape Scene.  Roark, as set up by Rand, would never have raped Dominique<br /><br />Pretentious Last Act.  During the final 200 pages or so all the characters seem to become mouthpieces for particular viewpoints and get exceptionally preachy.  While Toohey's \\"I will take over the world\\" speech is at times chilling, Roark's courtroom grandstanding is so transparently Ayn Rand talking through him.<br /><br />Mike.  The steelworker who only exists to prove that Roark is in touch with the common man.<br /><br />Hollywood Ending.  Dominique going up to see Roark on top of the skyscraper he's designing and getting buffeted by the sun's rays isn't becoming to the spirit of the novel.<br /><br />Anti-Socialism.  While there's nothing wrong (and indeed often many things right) with social or political criticism, the heavy-handed way Rand attacks socialism is so overt as to insult the reader's intelligence.<br /><br />So how did i like this book?  I'm not entirely sure, but it's well-written and enjoyable despite its 694-page length.  I won't call it a fast read, but it wasn't thick either and has enough ideas to keep the reader intellecutally engaged.ious Last Act.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|After a notably lengthy absence Pearl Jam has thundered back into the spotlight with their new self-titled studio album. If the album artwork is any indication the band strives with this new collection to get back to the core of what resonated with listeners back in the days they burst on the scene with their smash 1992 debut \\"Ten.\\" They more or less achieve this, eschewing the sales-be-dammed mentality of albums like \\"Riot Act\\" or \\"Yield\\" while not losing any of their unique punch.<br /><br />The set's lead single \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" complete with its anti-war sentiment and sharp political awareness, has become the band's biggest hit single since the late `90's. However, the entire collection is imbued with quality. For example, \\"Life Wasted,\\" which is currently climbing Billboard's modern rock chart, exudes wall-to-wall passion and world-weariness, while the invigorating \\"Marker In the Sand\\" examines the hypocrisy in killing in the name of religion.<br /><br />Despite the overall straightforward hard rock of the album, there are a moments of quiet introspection. \\"Parachutes,\\" for example is a mid-tempo vocal performance by singer Eddie Vedder that articulates that, with the right person, the joys of love make the pitfalls worth enduring. Also, \\"Inside Job\\" is a moody slice of self-examination, while \\"Gone\\" embodies melancholy in its purest sense, taking a cold hard look into American life and all its devastating aspects.<br /><br />\\"When the gas in my tank/Feels like money in the bank/Gonna blow it all this time/Take me one last ride/For the lights of this city/They only look good when I'm speeding/Gonna leave `em all behind me/'Cause this time I'm gone.\\"<br /><br />Anti-war sentiments also resurface on the disenchanted \\"Army Reserve\\" while \\"Severed Hand\\" weaves an interesting story with curious lyrics including wedding bands and dragons. Last but not least ,\\"Big Wave\\" and \\"Comatose\\" surge with propulsion and hard rock energy, while \\"Come Back\\" has the right cadence and intensity to linger over listeners long after it has been played.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Pearl Jam\\" is back in fine form with their self-titled LP. They have married what made their early albums runaway hits and their later albums unique and produced what is arguably their most accomplished work to date.r over listeners long after it has been played.

B00005JLF5|4.0|As is true with most shows, the first season of DS9 (seen in hindsight) has the actors groping a bit for their ultimate personality and style seen in later seasons.  Some of the interactions (between Odo and Quark for example) seem a bit over the top compared to the nuances seen in later seasons.  Still, there is a fair amount of backstory covered in this season that makes the later seasons more enjoyable to watch.  In my opinion, DS9 was the first Star Trek franchise to work more on a story arc than as individual episodes that could be watched in any order.  The quality of the DVD transfer is not as good as later seasons; Likely they didn't preserve the source material like today's shows.  The softness/dirtiness of the picture is about what a VHS tape would look like.  Not terrible, but not measuring up to today's DVD standards either.
B000001Y5X|1.0|Marilyn Manson is a very good lyricist. Anyone who listens to him knows that. This album was a good idea about how there are deeper messages in things like willy wonka than our parents would like us to know. Unfortunately, it was a failed attempt. It manages to merit a few good songs like dope hate, get your gun, and lunchbox, but that's about it. The album sounds like a cheap underground metal band, and there's a lot more to them on other albums. IT also seems really cheesy with all the child references. I can't blame it for sucking, because it was thier first album, i just prefer the other albums, especially Holy Wood.
B000FILW86|5.0|If you are a true Cheap Trick fan, you will love this album. I have purchased everything Trick has put out and I've been a fan since 78, and I haven't really liked anything they've put out in the last ten years, and I love everything they did in the 70's and 80's. This new cd is just great! It's like they found a lost recording that should have been released between Next Position Please and Standing on the Edge. They sound young again and Robins voice is back to what it once was in the 80's, and they've put the sense of humor back in the songs. <br />Buy it, you won't be dissapointed

B00005JOVH|5.0|After the beginning of the sage of \\"X-Men\\" beginning with the 2000 original and going all the way up to a much grander scale with \\"X-Men United\\", the third in what is sometimes referred to as the trilogy of X-Men films entitled \\"The Last Stand\\" brings the epic saga to a glorious close. I am very much clueless as to why this movie seems to be getting far more negative reviews than it's predecessors. While far from perfect, \\"The Last Stand\\" is true to it's title: It is a grand finale to the current X-Men movie saga. Yet I just can't imagine how they can make a fourth one after the events that take place here unless they are doing Wolverine or Magneto spin-off movies.<br /><br /> Some time after Charles Xavier's X-Men and his archenemy Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants united against a common foe hell-bent on wiping out the mutant race, the two camps are suddenly torn apart in an acrimonious division between the mutant race as non-mutant or `normal' humans devise a medical substance that works as a `cure' for mutant powers and suppresses the genes that cause the mutant powers to manifest. The so-called cure divides the mutant community into several camps but the prominent ones are the X-Men lead by Charles Xavier who work to bridge the divide between mutants and non-mutants, the second is of the scientists devising the `cure', and the third and most vicious is Magneto's camp who views the `cure' as a tactic to commit genocide against the mutant community and he and his army aim to destroy this cure and will destroy anyone who stands in his way, even if it's a mutant. So the battle begins and the battle lines are now drawn. Xavier, The X-Men and their allies believe in tolerance and bridging the divide between the mutants and human beings but Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants believes that mutants are the superior race on earth and aims to establish mutant control over non-mutants.<br /><br /> The so-called cure devised on a research facility on Alcatraz Island was made in reaction to the news of an enormously powerful mutant with the ability to wipe out entire cities with one fell swoop. Jean Grey, who was thought to have actually died after sacrificing herself to save the others from a large flood, mysteriously returns to life but with a far greater power that manifest in the subconscious parts of her mind. This power sees Grey revived as the Phoenix. Yet these enormous news powers that have manifested in her, have made her a monstrously powerful mutant whose powers endanger everyone around her, both ally and enemy alike, mutant and non-mutant alike, as well as the entire planet.<br /><br /> So the battle lines are drawn and the war begins between the three camps, the non-mutants protecting this `cure', the X-Men aiming to end the enmity between the races, and Magneto's Brotherhood organization's goals of mutant superiority. It is indeed the war to end all wars as so it is said. Who will turn out victorious when it is over?<br /><br /> I am absolutely proud to have seen this movie. A major reason for this is that the whole idea of a `cure' for mutants reminds me of the bigoted beliefs in `curing' homosexual and bisexuality in human beings and the horrific consequences of these bigoted beliefs. While too complex to jam into this review, watching \\"The Last Stand\\" really reminded me vividly of the gay rights movement occurring across the United States with one camp being those who've made their inner peace with their orientation and the other being the camp that views homosexuality as a `disease' which is completely and totally absurd. Such behavior is documented in almost every species of animals including dogs, cats, as well as our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Though there's much more about this that cannot be squashed into this review, \\"The Last Stand\\" story plot I felt has a lot of parallels to the battle against homophobia and intolerance against not just gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but also others because of their differences. There is no need for a `cure' for this orientation.<br /><br /> The movies problems though are similar to it's predecessors. Rogue is just another false-angst-ridden teen who's reduced from a dynamite comic character to just a wooden stock character who has almost no role in the events. In fact, Rogue felt more like an cameo extra rather than a main character. I really like this character and the complex background but after seeing some improvement in \\"X2\\" over its 2000 predecessor, I was disappointed. I think they should do a Rogue spin-off movie to make up for this. My biggest disappointment was the small role of Mystique after her front-row seat in the last movie. After being a major staple in the last two, Mystique is almost completely absent after about 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />Storm though is an improvement and has far better roles in this than before. The movie also somewhat tones down some of the emotional weight in favor of tons of action and a dazzling array of special effect. The emotional part is definitely there throughout but in many areas, it gets lost amidst the heavy amounts of action battle sequences and special effects in many parts of the movie. Who knows what may come next but after seeing this, I don't see how they could make another one without the characters who were so much a staple throughout this saga unless it's a total reboot of the film series similar to how \\"Batman Begins\\" rebooted the Batman movie franchise after the disaster of \\"Batman and Robin\\" a decade ago.of their differences.

0671027344|4.0|A friend of mine, who's currently going through her teaching certification, lent me this book.  Normally, I don't read anything teen-ish; I've since outgrown the genre.  But I like this book, a lot more than I thought I would.  The thing that strikes me about \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is that Charlie (the main character) is so detached.  He describes everything in astonishing detail (excepting that which is painful to him) but he's so emotionless about it.  I think that's something the other reviewers either didn't pick up on, or just failed to mention.  He just goes through life, studying and reading and learning math proofs, getting stoned along the way, but I don't think any it of means anything to him.  It's not about sex, drugs, football games and love (though many of the previous reviewers seems to be under that impression).  Those things happen to virtually every kid in high school.  It is Charlie's numbness that is most important, most articulated.  Even his pain and love and sorrow are distant.  I sincerely hope this is what Chbosky was going for.  Otherwise I'll be very disappointed.  And I'll go ahead and say that this reminded me of \\"The Virgin Suicides\\".  Go Jeff. <br /> <br /> <br />
0618001905|5.0|KING LEOPOLD's Ghost would deserve high praise even if it were not so well written, as it reveals the forgotten horrors of the Congo that took place only about 100 years ago.  We all learned about the horrors of this century, including the holocaust caused by Hitler and Nazi Germany, and the tyranny and gulags of Stalin in Soviet Russia, but no one learned about the ten million Congolese killed and millions more injured (hands and other body parts dismembered), kidnapped and brutalized by King Leopold II of Belgium and his cronies in history class.<br /><br />Yet, KING LEOPOLD's GHOST is anything but a dry history lesson.  It is an extremely well written work, and, if it were fiction, many parts would be considered quite entertaining. Sections about the explorer and thug Henry Morton Stanley's discoveries and exploits in Africa read like a travelogue, an adventure novel.  Other sections about Stanley and Leopold remind one of a gossip column- filled with juicy details of great scandals, incredible lies and wanton corruption.<br /><br />On the other hand, reading about the heroes such as ED Morel, Roger Casement, William Sheppard, and George Washington Williams is like reading several inspiring biographies:  these men, who were part of the first modern human rights movement, stood boldly against Leopold and his gang.  Like all good biographers, Hochschild does not romanticize his heroes.  All these men are shown as flawed human beings: Morel short-sightedly supported British colonialism even as he denounced atrocities in the Congo, Casement fell for romanticizing the struggle against colonialism and the myth of the noble savage, Williams couldn't help embellishing his biography.  However, despite their flaws, these men worked for the cause of justice in the Congo tirelessly and with great courage, and most ended up paying dearly.<br /><br />The heart of this work, however, remains the incredibly brutal treatment of the Congelese by Belgians and other Westerners: this included outright murder and dismemberment for not producing rubber quotas, merciless whipping with the 'chicotte' for being a 'lazy native,' burning and pillaging of rebellious villages, the kidnapping and starvation of women, and many other horrors too numerous to count.  The reason for these horrors was the insatiable greed of the colonialists, especially Leopold, who used ill-gotten profits obtained from such abusive slave labor to build lavish palaces, chateaus, greenhouses, and arches- and keep his prostitute lover living in high-style.<br /><br />As shocking and unjust as the horrors of the Congo was `the great forgetting' that took place afterwards, to the extent that even most Belgians did not know of this part of their history before this book was published:  Leopold was celebrated as a great and noble king whose mission in Africa was to `civilize' the natives and free them from `Arab slavery.'  Unfortunately, he often still is: Belgium is still trying to come to grips with this terrible episode of its history.<br /><br />Hochschild's book, in revealing and acknowledging the great horrors and injustices which took place in the Congo so recently in history, is a first step in understanding the problems facing Congelese today, and, one step in a long, long road towards healing.ners: this included outright murder and dismemberment for not producing rubber quotas, merciless whipping with the 'chicotte' for being a 'lazy native,' burning and pillaging of rebellious villages, the kidnapping and starvation of women, and many other horrors too numerous to count.

B0009S4IHY|3.0|The stylish and stylized \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is, as its name implies, a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd.  It is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town.  However, the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers' incredible skills as stunt men (and women) but the filmmaking prowess of those behind the camera as well.  Writer/director Stephen Chow (who also plays the main role) turns his flesh-and-blood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters, unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics, as they are stabbed repeatedly, fall from impossible heights, and suffer incredible bodily abuse, only to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  The razor sharp editing and multi-speed camerawork - ranging from fast-motion to freeze framing - also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.<br /><br />It's true that \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly.  And even for the most passionate of devotees, it can still be too much of a good thing.  The plot is frequently incoherent and the characters wafer-thin, but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a must-see for diehard fans of the martial arts.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I was worried about Superman Returns when after 20 minutes it failed to excite me. Then after Superman decides to rescue Lois on the plane things really become hot. The new actor who plays superman really has both Clark/Superman down. He really managed to portray the angst and sadness of the alien being which is superman without being a self-pitying sad sack.<br /><br />Lois was another matter. At first, I found the new actress for Lois a little annoying. She was fairly plain and her hair was always flying everywhere. It was difficult for me to believe she was a star reporter. She just didn't have any 'presence' or 'poise' when giving her interviews. I am glad she was less abrasive than her predecessors, but would've liked to see her look a bit more believable. She looked like an extra from Charmed, rather than poised confidant reporter. Perhaps this could be fixed with a better wardrobe, stylist, etc. Oddly enough though, the actress grew on me. While I don't think I could ever see the comic book Lois as a \\"Mommy\\" I ended up liking this Lois more than the previous one. Go figure.<br /><br />Jason was adorable, and I'm not a big fan of little kids in movies. They kept his lines to a minimum and he was perfect.<br /><br />Lois new beau was great. I'm a HUGE fan of Marsden, so I was pleased to see the actor introduced as the 'third' corner of the love triangle. I was glad he had a larger role, and that the character was not minimized to make Supes look good. He shown particularly in the plane scenes and the scene on the boat towards the end.<br /><br />The only downside of this film, I think was Lex. He was just too goofy. His sidekicks weren't serious. I'd like to have seen a more diabolical and calculating Lex, rather than the cartoon \\"I'm so evil\\" villain we were treated to. I guess I liked the Lex from Smallville so much, its hard to go back to the over-the-top version. Perhaps Lex was done this way to add some comic relief, but it seemed a bit flat considering the serious undertones to the film.<br /><br />There were a few false notes. I didn't care for the humor involving the Pomeranians...And Lois rebounding in the plane and walking around afterward was a little too much.<br /><br />5 Stars. A compelling, intriguing film.

0380789019|1.0|Based on what I've heard about this author and the interesting premise for this tale, I was greatly disappointed. Although I was drawn in at the beginning, I soon realized  that this was just an endless series of underground characters engaging in violent acts against each other while the plot meanders along passageways with little explanation for events and an ultimately disappointing conclusion. I may give Mr. Gaiman another try, but based on this first taste it will be a while before I bother. This was even suggested to me as a possible young adult novel, but I would suggest parents steer clear unless your student is a high schooler or older.  I won't be surprised if others rank this review as \\"not helpful\\" because they disagree, but please respect an alternative opinion. I am an open-minded, avid reader of a wide variety of genres, so I thought it only fair to include an honest review from a different perspective. Hope it helps wavering customers.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Well written and well directed, this movie converts more fans everyday and is on its way to becoming a popular hit long after it opened in theaters.<br /><br />Based on the sci-fi adventure series, Firefly, (which was never given half a chance on Fox network), this film runs the emotional gamet of laughter and tears with several thought-provoking scenes that keep you thinking \\"What if...\\" long after watching them.
B0000028UK|5.0|For my money Vs. is the pinnacle of Pearl Jam's career.  Ten was a great debut, but was bogged down by the grunge sound at times while Vitology had some better songs, but it was also a decent into lunacy with songs like Bugs and the closing \\"song.\\"  But it is Vs. where everything came together, expanding on the grunge sound, to make the best album of their career. <br /> <br />Vs. starts out with the one-two punch of Go and Animal, two songs that, if they can't get your blood pumping, nothing will.  But the band quickly showed their growth next with Daughter where they were able to slow things down without going into the power ballad cliché.  The musicianship really shines through on the song and I love the ambiguity of the lyrics with the booklet saying the line in \\"violins (ence).\\"  Granted intelligibility of Eddie Vedder doesn't work because for a long time I thought he was saying \\"a glorified version of a pelican.\\" <br /> <br />Dissident features one of the best riffs the band has come up with making you wonder how the duel attack of Stone Gossard and Mike McCready are always absent from best guitarist list, but that may be the answer, that there is two of them.  The band takes a complete left turn on W.M.A. with its percussion and bass heavy song about police brutality and still has yet come close to creating another song like it which is somewhat of a same.  Rats may not have been the best song on the album, but you got to love the Michael Jackson shoutout at the end. <br /> <br />Near the end of the album are two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs starting with the pulsing Rearviewmirror.  I remember after getting my license a few years later and I loved playing this song at night in the summer on a country road with the windows down as each passing headlight telling a different story as the song made a perfect soundtrack.  There was just a sense of optimism to the song.  On the other hand Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town took a much more subtleapproach and after two albums filled with doom and gloom, the song was a refreshing breath of clarity and simplicity. <br /> <br />The album ends with the haunting Indifferent, yet another chance the band took and the line, \\"I'll swallow poison until I grow immune\\" still sends a chill down my spine to this day.  The diversity and the and all the successful risks the band took on Vs. makes it the best of their career.  And yes, I do have one of the copies of the CD without the title on it.  (If you remember, the band did have a name for the album when it when to print, so the first shipment went out without Vs. appearing on the album anywhere.)

These 4 men of the Camel Club, conspiracy theorists and admitted oddballs, now realize that their own lives are in jeopardy and they must try to figure out why the man was killed as well as try to identify his murderers.   <br /> <br />Alex Ford is the secret service agent assigned to investigate the murder since a secret service pin was found in the pocket of the dead man.  But Alex soon discovers that forces beyond simple interagency rivalries will do everything they can to keep him from the truth.  What unravels is a complicated plot involving Middle Eastern terrorists let by mercinaries hired by the highest bidder.  Alex and the Camel Club are drawn together to solve the murderous mystery and keep the President of the United States alive while preventing nuclear war from erupting between the US and the various countries of the Middle East. <br /> <br />Baldacci has not been up to speed for his last couple of books, but this one is another step in the right direction.  The Camel Club has a more sophisticated plot than the last couple of books and keeps the reader guessing for most of it.  At times it drags a bit and the pages don't turn like Baldacci's early work, but overall it is a entertaining and worthwhile read.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|It's no wonder why Jerry McGuire is one of the few chick flicks that guys can actually enjoy because it had football for us dudes to focus on.  As for chick flicks, that's pretty much the list except for one caveat; oddly enough John Cusack who has somehow make a career out of making watchable romantic comedies from hoisting up the jukebox in Say Anything all the way up to one of the best movies of the past ten years, High Fidelity. <br /> <br />Cusack's latest entry into the genre is Must Love Dogs, a movie centered on what seems to be a booming business, internet dating.  Both Cusack and his female counterpart, Diane Lane, are recently divorced yet not ready to get back into the game.  But thanks to some nosey family members and an over-sex lawyer, both inadvertently make into the world of on-line dating.  Sadly that's where the hilarity stops. <br /> <br />The start of the movie starts off with a few chucklers and looks to be focused on the two main characters as they are forced to get back on the horse.  But once the internet profile is set up, it quickly turns into Lane's movie and Cusack wrongly takes a back seat.  At this point the movie is rarely romantic or comedic, which is never good for a film that is supposed to be in the genre.  Speaking of underused, Stockard Channing is grossly underused as one of Lane's father's girlfriends.  Much like the Cusack character, Channing's looked as if they had a bigger part for it, but never got around to fleshing it out. <br /> <br />Plenty of romantic comedy cliché about most notably the obligatory spontaneous break out into song scene.  Oddly Dermot Mulroney, who may have started this cliché in My Best Friend's Wedding, is involved in the scene and adds to the insainity of the premise by rushing to the piano to accompany the singing.  And what mobile home doesn't have a piano?  The biggest fraud of this movie hough is that not only did neither main character actually own a dog; Snoop Doggy Dogg didn't even appear in the movie.  What a shame.
0596007124|5.0|Different. Is the definition of this book. They teach you a new method, a new perspective of learning something. Usually, if you buy a book about Design Patterns you'll probably use it just in time, or just to a fast consult. This Head First not. You want to read. It's funny. It's understandable. It's easy.<br /><br />It was really funny to read about Observer and Subject dialog at Observer Pattern, two interfaces that talk each other, their relationship... Pretty cool. I think it's the best way to stuck something usually boring into the brain. Some humor is necessary and maybe the key to pass so many information without lose the main point. The topics are very easy and they walk slow, soft, don't try to burn your neurones out. Also, a lot of arrows, pictures, stories and everything else helps your eyes to bring to your head the big idea of the issue.<br /><br />Some exercises are very important too. You can buy this book and make sure that you'll do learn about patterns.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|OK, so I've seen everyone else's feelings about the movie, now I'm going to add my own comments, despite my not being much of a writer and not really wanting to write a \\"review\\", as much as just express my feelings on the movie.  <br /> <br />So, here's the deal: I'm a very emotional person (I'm thinking possibly because of a depression problem I may have, or it's just my personality), but yet never show any emotion, like I have a block or something. Embarrassment and fear of judgment is a large part of it...  <br /> <br />ANYWAY, that may kind of seem like unnecessary info but it's pertinent to my comments, in that this movie made me feel emotional and *GASP!* almost made me cry. :-) _That_ is how I know a movie is good, when it doesn't just touch me (like many a movie has in the past), but touches me to where my emotional block almost gives way. There's only been a few movies in my recollection that have hit me like that; this was one of 'em. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I _didn't_ cry! If I had then I would have given it the full 5. <br /> <br />There are many parts that move me (mostly Ennis's of course), but the part that really got to me was at the end when he opens his closet and looks at Jack's shirt and says, \\"Jack Twist, I swear.\\"   That's the part that gets me the most!  The saddest thing to me, of the whole movie is that Ennis denied his relationship with Jack, leaving Jack longing for him badly, causing his wife and daughters pain at divorcing, not to mention that last blonde gal he went out with, and eventually never knowing and having what could have been with Jack, because of his death. That is one of the things that makes this movie memorable, and reminds me that love is a wonderful thing that is worthy of chasing no matter what the odds, even though serious risks my be present. <br /> <br />I suspect this movie is more affecting and more \\"relatable\\" with a new meaning and significance, to homosexuals, esp. those that have gone through similar situations. I haven't gone through Ennis and Jack's plight, but I can sure relate to a lot of things about the story!   <br /> <br />Crash may have won the Best Picture, and Crash is a good movie for sure, that also affected me and made me think, but I highly agree that it should have taken second place to this amazing movie. Anyone that is homophobic or is trying to overcome that phobia, it would be a strong suggestions to see this movie as it presents some of the very common struggles that straight and gay people alike can relate to, that many a straight couple has probably had to go through in the past. And, it shows that love between two men is just as beautiful and wonderful as love between a man and a woman, no matter who or what both men are. <br /> <br />This is too long! Sorry for jumping on a soapbox! Hope that my 2 cents worth is worth something! :-)

In response to Darth Wader's review in particular, as well as any other Christian reader who decided they needed to bash Mr. Brown's novel, did you ever think maybe Mr. Brown is just an intelligent man who came up with a cool idea for a story to ENTERTAIN his readers?<br /><br />I don't see how your \\"defense\\" of Christianity or the existence of Christ can merit a full throttled bashing of a man's well written and highly entertaining popular novel. If I have it right, isn't there a reference in God's word to judgement and how we shouldn't go around judging others? You have your faith; even I have mine. If your faith is so strong, then why waste your time giving a bad review to a man who wrote a book and certainly doesn't deserve a bad review?<br /><br />And if he is attacking the Christian religion, so what? Stop crying about it.

B00005JOQS|3.0|Let me start out by say this;  <br />If Warners' was going to do another Superman movie. They <br />should've made a fresh start of it. <br /> Watching this movie was like visting a loved one's grave at <br />mid-winter. and seeing shadows flitter in and out of your vision <br />range. <br /> There was just to many references to the first movie. From the <br />opening theme, to Marlon Brando's post mortum apperance, and once again we have Lex Luthor's ridiculus obssesion with land! <br /> It was funny and clever the first time,(as portrayed by Gene Hackman). But this time with Lex (Spacey)being played as a nasty, sadistic, and bitter creep. It was just un-appealing. <br /> The scenes between Lois and Superman(Clark Kent). Were more of <br />a study in marriage consuling than just a strained reunion. <br />But a real failure in the movie is what the writers didn't do  with the introduction of Lois Lane's son Jason.  <br /> So much could've been done with this aspect of the story. <br />Instead of him being played as a frail asmatic dull child. He could have been played as a normal active five year old. (Supernormal if you get my drift!) <br /> Also, the part of Randy White, Perry White's nephew could have been eliminated altogether. He adds nothing to the story at all.   <br /> To sum it up Superman Returns, while not being a total flop <br />isn't a complete winner either. <br /> <br />

B00005JP0A|3.0|If you can, read the book, and then save the movie for when it is released for rental.  It wasn't bad. The story however, is predictable and the movie is (or at least seemed) long so we were squirming in our seats and ready to go about 20-30 minutes before the conclusion.   <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway is cute, transforming her self from undergrad to a NY girl channeling her inner fashion maven. (She did it better in Princess Diaries and she was a lot more fun and likeable in that).  <br /> <br />Stanley Tucci, as always, was great but didn't get enough time on the film.   <br /> <br />The saving grace and crowning glory though is Meryl Streep as the mean fashion editor (Anna Wintour anyone?) which she played wonderfully, not having to overact but rather relying on the smallest gestures.  She shows why she is still great and can open films!!

B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman Returns will be loved by followers of the Superman movies that was played by Christopher Reeves in the past.. I'm a follower and a Superman fanatic.. And I really like the new movie... Superman Returns, to put it simply, is like a mirror reflection of the first Superman movie.. At times uncanny.. Watch the first Superman movie and you will know what I mean.. Even the pace of the movie is similar to Superman 1.. And the homages in Superman Returns... just brilliant... Bryan Singer did a splendid job for Superman Returns..<br /><br />For the neutrals, maybe they were expecting something more from Superman Returns.... Like more action and a fast paced movie... They would be disappointed..<br /><br />Overall, Superman Returns is a good movie and will be loved by Superman followers who loved the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeves.

B000002HK4|5.0|for 10 dollars you can be the proud owner of the best DT song ever.  A Change of Seasons is the infamous 23 minute epic song that many consider to be one of the best progressive metal pieces ever written.  This may seem like the perfect scenario for multiple, emotionless chunks of guitar shredding that sometimes infect DT's work.  Contrary to what you would think, Petrucci's solos are few and far between but are played with emotion and end at just the right times. Labrie sounds his best on this  album especially during the section Another World.  So with two of DT's biggest flaws gone, what's there not to love about this song. Get it today and enjoy the covers as a bonus.

B00005JOQS|3.0|It was not to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, newcomer Brandon Routh channels Christopher Reeve very well, so there's a continuity of the character.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth was woefully miscast. As delightful as she is to watch, how did Lois Lane get younger if five years have passed since the last Supe movie, per the story line?<br /><br />Langella's a good Perry White.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, as terrific an actor as he is, just couldn't measure up to Gene Hackman's possession of the Lex Luthor role.<br /><br />The special effects were terrific; technology's definitely advanced since the Reeves movies. But surprisingly enough, not all that much. There wasn't much here we hadn't seen in the originals (which goes to show how much care was put into the first two -- the second two of the quartet were pretty bad).<br /><br />Being an engineer, I have to say that even though I'm willing to accept a lot of artistic license, when the science within the piece becomes inconsistent it has an impact on my opinion. For instance: Supe obviously doesn't need to breathe air, which is why he can fly in outer space. Yet in a scene where he's being rushed into a hospital, he's being oxygenated with an oxygen mask. In the hospital, he's hooked up to an EKG, which gives a blood pressure/pulse readout. I thought his skin was impermeable. The EKG reading should have been zero, as if hooked up to a stone. There are others, too, but it makes no sense to highlight everything.<br /><br />But more importantly are a couple of key elements that just didn't measure up.<br /><br />The major Luthor disaster at the action core of the movie was, in my opinion, somewhat pedestrian. It was basically a rehash of Hackman's Luthor escapade from the Reeves movies, with a different coat on.<br /><br />The real driving spine of the movie is, I think, the unrequited and unfinished love story between Supe and Lois. I hate to say it, but I didn't think this worked at all. It could have worked better if Lois didn't have the current live-in boyfriend, perhaps. I don't know. I also didn't pick up much chemistry between Routh and Bosworth. Nothing like we saw before between Reeves and Kidder.<br /><br />It was an okay two-and-a-half hours, but I'm afraid it didn't live up to the hype. Nowhere near the type of accomplishment that \\"Batman Begins\\" was to that franchise.ked better if Lois didn't have the current live-in boyfriend, perhaps. I don't know.

B00009V7P8|4.0|I would love this CD totally if he had not included the last 2 songs.
B00005JOIH|5.0|I had seen this movie at the theater,nevertheless I bought the DVD because there is so much to it that you have to watch it more than once.The acting is great,but above all it is another great Spielberg movie with the usual faithful historical background.Don't miss it.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|A stellar cast is drawn together for...what? For the biggest load of tripe I've had the misfortune to sit through in a long time. <br /> <br />Hmmm...Romantic COMEDY? Laugh...I thought I'd never start - and I was not wrong. Not a chuckle, not a titter was raised. Humour of the middle-class dinner party variety doesn't work for me. Lame, obvious jokes and cartoon characters abound. \\"Common as muck\\" Natalie swears in front of the \\"upper-crust\\" Prime Minister and we're supposed to find it funny? Charming? Believable??? PREPOSTEROUS?!  <br /> <br />LOVE? If Richard Curtis thinks his threadbare characterizations and superficial plot lines constitute or represent love in any meaningful way then he is bonkers, actually. <br /> <br />If Disney made movies for the adult market then this is what they'd come up with. Utter rubbish.  <br /> <br />
0679735259|1.0|dispatches is boring. herr read too much kerouac and obviously writes stoned, as other reviewers said. the result: when you read this you think \\"what a wasted opportunity\\". it may be herr's version of vietnam, but it's so personal and biased that it can't really be considered a work of art.   in between the lines he seems to say that he has endured vietnam - and there's no doubt about it - but in what capacity? as a reporter?  this is an important theme in the second half of the book, and herr gets completely lost in his ramblings. he also wants to tell us that vietnam is a hell, but the reader doesn't feel it's hell. one only feels boredom. it's almost like herr is saying, \\"forget it, I can't express on paper what vietnam was\\". So, why write this? (herr co-wrote the script of apocalypse now and full metal jacket and probably contributed the boring parts).  the book fails as a memoir and it also fails as a historical log - which we all know it's not.  could this book be succesful?: yes. if it had a structure, if herr didn't waste time on stupid details, if he wasn't so egocentric, if the rhythm was improved.   contrast: the movie platoon is much, much better. or the deer hunter. those works capture hell. this book doesn't.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I love sci-fi flicks. At the time, I had not herd of this one, but it sounded interesting. I have to say I was really impressed. Christian Bale is such a great actor, and with his performance alone it's worth seeing.  Along with an intriguing story, great atmosphere and awesome fight sequences, this has become a favorite of mine.
B000069KGM|5.0|This was the sound that drew me into a love affair with Chicago!  The gritty sound of Terry Kath's guitar (one of the most underrated guitarists ever!) meshed with the classic Chicago brass and funky / progressive rhythyms.  Oh.....and their great vocal harmonies were pretty darn good too.  This album has some terrific jams.....as did other vintage early Chicago during the Kath era.  What a trajedy when we lost him back in ' 78.  With all due respect to the other band members...they were never the same without him.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|I just happened to catch this one on TV. It looked like it was going to be a stylish kung fu flick, but quickly realized it was a comedy, and quite a good one at that.  The effects and fighting were really impressive. Dunno if I would buy it, but I would not have been sorry had i rented it.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This young lady is so very talented that it is criminal!  I am so glad to see true talent and true music.  To say the least, the majority of today's music is lacking.  But thanks to my girl, she has broken us off the real deal! I cannot stop listening to the CD.  She has true talent - tight lyrics, great band, and an emotion-infused presentation of soul singing.  You can feel her on every word - and she sings without effort.  I would have to say that her style is organic, and the likes of her have not been seen in a long time.  I am awaiting the next album soon!  There is no one like this sister. Do your thing Corinne!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Mr. Fawlty is the hotel manager in over his head, while trying his best to manage the chaos which swirls around him.  His stoic, quietly no-nonsense wife is the rock, supported by her young blond assistant, and the waiter, a young latin man learning English.  What happens in the hotel as the hotel guests interact with Mr. Fawlty, his wife and staff is delightful fun.  I recommend Fawlty Towers - The Complete Collection.
1594200823|5.0|Ostensibly this book is about organic versus industrial food, but I think that is just the launching pad for the best discussion of our culture since Daniel Quinn's \\"Ishmael.\\"  The writing is crystal clear, personal, and full of incredible insights.  It is the best kind of non-fiction writing,  combining journalism based on personal experience and academic writing based on the reading of a large number of relevant books and articles.  Pollan's examination of food encompasses, biology, ecology, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.  He takes a topic we take for granted, food, and turns it into a fascinating story. I give this book my highest recommendation enough because it is changing my thinking and my way of living.
B000002C2E|5.0|This collection brings up feelings you may wish you had forgotten, making it a little hard to hear if the moment is not just so..but it's real 'Bob' through and through.  I bought the remaster to hear it again after a long hiatus, because it is purported to be part of a trilogy that will include 'Love and Theft' and the new release 'Modern Times' due out the end of August 2006.  Sometimes I miss 'baby Bob' with his beautiful acoustic sets, harp, baby fat cheeks and crazy-making soft lips...but that Bob is in here too, just a little older, a little harder, heartbreakingly wiser...like of a lot of us I suppose.
B0001US8EO|5.0|When my family came home with this video I wasn't too impressed.  The reviews I had read were mediocre and I'm not the greatest fan of westerns anyway.  But I was wrong.  The Doc Holliday character reminded me of a close friend I once had.  I found myself sympathizing with the characters.  It kept my interest and as soon as the film was over I began researching the life of Wyatt Earp to learn new things I didn't know.  I gave this video 5 stars for two reasons.  The first 4 stars were because I liked the film.  The 5th star was because it caused me to learn something new that will stay with me.  Any 3 hour film that will leave me with permanent new knowledge is worth 5 stars.
B00000633N|5.0|`Introspective' consists of 6 tracks... short of the average 9 tracks on an album.  Always On My Mind / In My House, Domino Dancing and 4 other tracks... entertaining and dynamic in sound.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|FFVII - Advent Children was a great opportunity to look into the life of Cloud after the battle with Sephiroth.  The story was well written and there was no stretch in making the connection from game to movie(except for Barret's hair).  There was even a bonus section that showed actual screenshots from the game, to help bring back fond memories.<br /><br />  The only down side to this story is if Cloud was not your favorite character from the game.  Although all the main characters, Barret, Tifa, Yuffie, Cait Sith, Red, Vincent, Cid, and even Aerith, make brief appearances, the main story focuses on Cloud.<br /><br />  All in all this is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan, be it casual or fanatic!
B000FMGTTE|1.0|WOW! They BLEW IT! I have to say that I'm NOT surprised. With the passing of composers like Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, Bernard Herrmann & Miklos Rosza there are only a few REAL composers left working in film scoring. John Williams, of course leads the pac, followed closely by James Horner and John Barry, Ennio Morricone & Philip Glass. Then we have a few who stand out more than occasionally like John Scott, Laurence Rosenthal, Richard Robbins, and a few others. A few of the newcomers are putting forth some excellent efforts like Don Davis, David Arnold, and occasionally Hans Zimmer. It's interesting to note that all of the top composers listed above are older and come from a classical school of training or even jazz background. Now we come to today's composers: James Newton Howard, Howard Shore, Marco Beltrami, Danny Elfman, John Powell etc.  These guys are really just sound designers, not really composers. They are loud, soft, fast and slow, and without the film, there \\"music\\" falls dead born. Mostly getting there feet wet in the 80's and have pop music backgrounds and if you look at there beginnings, they weren't very good then either. They have managed to wedge themselves into the industry thru the buddy system and usually in the company of other mediocre talent as well. Now mind you, there have been some GREAT film composers that have come out of pop music, i.e. John Barry, Giorgio Moroder and Paul McCartney are the best known. But again, they come from 60's and 70's pop music era. I cant help but think that something happened in the musical idioms of the 80's that has left the new composers of that time and now with no inspirational ear for melody, or emotion or even originality. And thus, we are left with more forgettable scores for some of the biggest films of the last 20 years, i.e. SPIDERMAN, HULK, OMEN 2006, XMEN, FANTSTC 4, LORD OF THE RINGS, and most unfortunately SUPERMAN RETURNS. I read the excited reviews of these scores and it saddens me because I know that the talent is out there and perhaps a big part of the problem is in the knowledge of the producers, directors, composers and yes, the public at large, simply have no knowledge of the masterworks that exist out there, and we as a public must demand that filmmakers produce better quality scripts, acting, and music. Until we do, we will get the flashy, sometimes competent but empty music. Listen to the above composers mentioned, and then listen to Danny Elfman, John Ottman, James Newton Howard, Marco Beltrami etc.  You'll never listen to them the same way again. John Williams labors and Agonizes over his melodies, they only sound simple and easy. Lets get to work composers, and leave a true legacy of beautiful & inspired music for this and the generations to come.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey is not my type of singer. I don't usually listen to her. But I heard part of a song and then went online to hear the reast of the cd. It's a very good cd and I'm pleasently surprised
B00005JOQS|4.0|Critical opinion of this new take on the Superman legacy has been pretty spilt down the middle.  Our city newspaper gave it a C-, which disappointed me, since it was one of the films I was looking forward to seeing this summer.<br /><br />I was glad I gave it a chance despite the lukewarm reception some were giving it.  It is a fun, action-packed, well-intentioned movie that is perhaps just about 15 minutes too long.<br /><br />The story's plot is centers around the return of not only Superman, but Lex Luthor, as well.  Luthor's plot is cataclysmic, global, and just scary enough to satisfy any action movie fan.<br /><br />The action sequences are very well done, particularly an airplane scene fairly early in the film.<br /><br />A note about the actors:<br /><br />Brandon Routh is a worthy successor to Christopher Reeve, although he doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the screen.  It seems he is trying very hard to recapture Reeve's interpretation of the caped hero.  Kevin Spacey makes for a great Lex Luthor, although it has been said that Luthor himself isn't an evil enough adversary for Superman.  I say, he's ten times more menacing that the laughable Luthor played by Gene Hackman (who is a fantastic actor).  Kate Bosworth is much more fun to look at than Margot Kidder, but definitely lacks the expert grittiness that Kidder brought to the screen.<br /><br />Above all, though, Parker Posey stole the show. She brings freshness and vitality to the role of Luthor's girlfriend, and I kept wishing for more scenes with her.<br /><br />While \\"Superman Returns\\" lacks the resonance and power of the recent Spiderman ventures, the film is a pleasant surprise and just what one hopes for from a summertime trip to the movies.
B000E97HIA|4.0|For the record, I'm going to have to agree with the majority and say that the editorial reviewer's labeling Prince as \\"the black Beck\\" came too far out of left field (because among other things, Prince came out WAY before Beck did), although I do love Beck's music. I also agree when people say that before Musicology, Prince hadn't made a truly great album since Diamonds and Pearls. Fortunately, he keeps the flavor coming with 3121.<br /><br />Reviewer Michael A. Beyer really took the words out of my mouth. By now we should all know not to expect one style from Mr. Nelson, but he does still deliver in what we DO expect. There are baby-makin' jams aplenty like \\"Satisfied\\" and \\"Incense and Candles\\". And if you're looking for just plain funk, try the title track or \\"Lolita\\" on for size. Another good one is the single \\"Black Sweat\\", which I didn't really like at first, but I can't get enough of it now (although I don't really understand that \\"you'll be screaming like a white lady\\" part).<br /><br />When Prince skips the freaky talk and just tries to get sentimental, he hits (\\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\") and misses (\\"Te Amo Coraz&oacute;n\\"). By the way, the former features T&aacute;mar, and she is NOT Toni Braxton's sister. And although I've gotten used to that screaming Prince does at the end of certain songs, I never liked it, which is what ruins the end of \\"The Dance\\".<br /><br />All in all, 3121 is an exceptional album that reminds people why we keep listening to Prince after all these years. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000002P6R|4.0|This is a great album.  It is well written and superbly performed.  It has great Who tracks like You Better You Bet, Daily Records (my personal favorite on this album), Don't Let Go The Coat, and Another Trick Day.  Not every song is fabulous, but there isn't any that's godawful.  I think it's ridiculous that people expect The Who to play the same music when they were young.  They have to grow as artists.  And as for people who complain about Kenney Jones's drumming...it's fine for these albums.  Jones was a good drummer, but he was no Keith Moon.  But Jones never tried to be Keith Moon.  He couldn't.  No one can.  And besides, Moon's drumming on By Numbers and Who Are You was relatively subdued compared to The Who's previous work, so all the animalistic behaviour was catching up with him.  So even if Moon was still alive when this album was made, his drumming would have more than likely continued in that vain.  This is a better album than It's Hard and By Numbers.  I love the cover art, too.  Overall, a solid album....
0060763280|3.0|Nothing mentioned in this book is new, but it is a convenient collection of the programming one needs to develop an attitude toward attracting and keeping wealth. The author's style comes across as smug, and frankly, he isn't rich enough (depite what he thinks) to be qualified. But then the really rich wouldn't be writing a book. Please read as subjective guideline and don't be a zombie follower like some of the reader reviews you see here.
B000FA57RG|5.0|While I would like for this package to include all of her material from the tour, at least we finally have a live CD to sink our teeth into! I have never seen Madonna live (I would gladly give my right arm) but I am a huge fan of her work in music, video, and performance. The songs sound great, and even the rather stale by comparison American Life tracks sound good when performed live. I love that she did \\"The Beast Within\\" as the intro and then kicked it up with \\"Vogue\\". All the songs flowed together nicely and I always enjoy her interaction with the audience. There is so much energy and passion in what this woman does, it's just amazing. Could the live version of \\"Like a Prayer\\" be any more amazing? And who would have thought a Scottish bagpipe intro would lead to \\"Into the Groove\\"? How about her amazing cover of \\"Imagine\\"? Incredible! Next time I just hope if she does another live CD, maybe she could include all of the songs. But I'm not complaining! She's Madonna and she can do whatever she wants! As far as the DVD goes, I love it. I saw it when it aired on TV a while back but I didn't get to see the whole thing. Like all of the other Madonna DVDs, I enjoyed this one alot. Truth or Dare, it's not. Still, it's provocative in different ways now, and even though Madonna is no longer controversial for her sexual antics, she still is for her religious imagery/comments/beliefs and her newfound political agenda. On the DVD, we see Madonna raising a stink with some fans after the show for being a bit too preachy with the state of the world and the importance of voting. \\"Madonna should stick with music\\", one says. What? Isn't that the point of making music? To send a message? Just like in 1991's Truth or Dare doc, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret chronicles Madonna's ever evolving attempt at \\"waking people up\\"-with mixed reactions from the media and the public. This time, the action is not relegated to just stage and backstage. We go to Israel with her (against the wishesof her security), we chat with her adorable kids and adorable husband. We see the auditions for the dancers. Alot of people say this one is more about Madonna and her family rather than Madonna and the dancers, who she once called her \\"children\\". But actually we learn a little more about the dancers this time around and they don't seem to be as catty and dramatic as the ones who were on Blonde Ambition. Nikki and Donna are hardly shown at all, and actually I don't think Donna was even on Re-Invention (someone correct me if I'm wrong). I love the scenes with Guy singing drinking songs and with he and Madge going to the pub and she's bored out of her mind. I always enjoy seeing her dad and her step mom Joan. This time, it shows where she grew up and it has more about her dad as he recalls how Madonna was as a child and his feelings about some of her \\"naughty\\" behavior in her career. The best stuff though is the music. I think this one shows more performance highlights than Truth or Dare did. Personally I will always think Blonde Ambition was the best show she's done, but I love them all. This one is no exception. It was well executed and the DVD does a bang up job of documenting the blood, sweat and tears put into the show. Even if you're not a huge fan of Madonna, I think you could appreciate the sincerity, heart, and talent put into this piece of work. I found it to be informative, inspirational, funny, and thoroughly entertaining. While she is not the same Madonna she was back in 1990, one thing hasn't changed: she still keeps our attention.
B00005JP40|5.0|I have read many mixed reviews regarding this movie, but have to say that it's been a VERY long time since I've viewed a movie and walked away feeling \\"uplifted\\".  Kinky Boots explores so many areas of our human nature, with class and without vulgarity!  It teaches us to love ourselves for who we are, to never be afraid of reaching for our dreams and that it's always necessary to look inside the oyster to find a pearl!  This is a movie I'd watch daily ... it's a true ray of sunshine!
0802130208|5.0|John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece and Pulitzer Prize winning novel, A Confederacy of Dunces is much more than an epic comedy, but a tour de force in post-modernistic art--a true study in American Literature.  The character dynamic within the pages of this text will stay with you forever.  Ignatius, the main character, will keep you laughing throughout the entire book, however, the novel as a whole will bring you to tears.  Toole had talent, a force rarely seen from a writer--especially in modern times. <br /> <br />Anyone who has rated this book under four stars can consider themselves illiterate degenerates (as Ignatius might say) and completely responsible for the lack of talent, and most likely admirers of Paris Hilton and reality TV.  For the vast majority of you who has given this book the credit it deserves, I commend you; for you show me there is still hope in within the literary arts. <br /> <br />No review can depict the true nature of this book--it's something you just need to read.  Because deep within the epic character, Ignatius, lies a truth within each of us and A Confederacy of Dunces will expose much more than fits of laughter--but a meaning in life when all hope diminishes.         <br />
0312263120|3.0|I love Dan Brown books.  I have to say, I've learned much about France and Rome reading DaVinci Code and the Angels and Demons.  However, Dan Brown has to do more research in computer world and basic ideas about JAPAN.  The book was based on events in DC with National Sercurity Agency and in Spain involving chracters who are both based in US and in Japan.  His knowledge of the Japanese and Japanese culture depicted in the book, albeit small, are so inaccurate, it is almost offensive.  Names used, chracters portrayed about the boss getting massage naked in their offices....  my goodness!  and Dan Brown is a teacher and graduate of Exeter?  He needs to go visit Japan more often or have few Japanese friends.  May be we need to send more sushi chefs in New Hampshire. <br /> <br />That is your home work for you, Dan.
B00005JOX6|1.0|I have never really found Adam Sandler to be especially funny. But at least he has played some likable characters in previous films such as \\"Big Daddy\\" and \\"Spanglish\\". Here he plays a truly miserable jerk named Michael Newman. Michael is a workoholic architect who ignores his family while pursuing career advancement. He manages to come in possession of a \\"universal remote control\\" which allows him to fast forward through his every day life directly to the big promotion he is aiming for at work. Later the remote control begins to operate automatically and Michael comes to regret all the years he has wasted.  <br /> <br />This film obviously is attempting to imitate \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". But any serious comparision would be an insult to Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. This is because while that all time classic had heart and charm, \\"Click\\" is basically a series of crude jokes, racist stereotypes and product placement for big corporations. Truly it's the epitome of low brow Hollywood mediocrity and it is beyond me how anyone over age 12 could find this junk funny. I must admit I actually liked the central idea - that life is be appreciated on a daily basis rather than always wanting to \\"fast forward\\" towards future goals.This is something that I have to remind myself of on a regular basis. But the movie is just too mindless, rude and completely devoid of laughs to make it worth watching.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Jack White is my hero.  There is nothing this man attempts that isn't first rate.  This album is a trip back to the early days of psychedelic rock.  Like others I hear a lot of john lennon in these songs but also a lot of moody blues and the hollies and a touch of led zeppelin.  I recommend this cd for those who have steered clear of the white stripes because they are not melodic enough.
0440237688|5.0|There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said in these 2,000 plus reviews.  I have read this book many times since grade school and the words still echo in my head.  It really is hard for this story to leave my mind...I think that's what makes it such a successful book.
0385338694|1.0|The Undomestic Goddess by Sophie Kinsella is pure, unadulterated, undiluted Chicklit. It is written in the same style as her Shopaholic books. Why did I ever think that it would change?  And yet I read it all from cover to cover anyways. <br /> <br />In Undomestic Goddess, Samantha Sweeting is the heroine. She is a 29 year old lawyer on the verge of partnership at Carter Spink, London's number one law firm.  She works 100 hour weeks in order to close her bank deals for her clients. Just minutes prior to the partnership announcement, Samantha finds out that she has made a 50 million pound mistake and one of her clients loses out big time. Rightly scared of being fired, she leaves the offices and London in a fog and finds herself in the countryside, having been hired as a housekeeper for a wealthy family. Samantha doesn't have the heart or the ovaries to correct the family so she stays there, learns the ins and out of being a domestic goddess, falls in love and realizes that she never really wanted to be a successful career woman to begin with. <br /> <br />::pukes:: Need I say more?  Beach read, mindless.  Shallow characters.  Made me retch the entire time that I was reading it.  Don't even bother with this one.  <br />
B000003C4K|5.0|For me, 'real' thrash metal was born in 1984 as the b*stard child of Motorhead (Overkill, 1979), Venom (Welcome to Hell, 1981), Discharge (Why?, 1981), Bad Brains (Bad Brains, 1982) and Metallica (Kill em All, 1983). Three albums can be seen as defining this genre: Exodus' \\"Bonded by Blood\\" (recorded in 1984), Destruction's \\"Infernal Overkill\\" (1985) and Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" (1986).<br /><br />Going beyond the more 'civilised' speed metal of NWOBHM-influenced US bands like Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Overkill, 'real' thrash metal was characterized by a very straightforward, aggressive and much more black metal & hardcore punk influenced style. You might say that Exodus contributed the basic song blueprints and overall brutality to thrash metal; Destruction provided a unique combination of intelligent, intricate songwriting and sheer intensity (the US market, mostly ignorant of the European scene, had to wait for Death Angel to deliver this kind of combo); and with Slayer everything culminated into the Reign in Blood landmark that is still the major achievement of the genre.<br /><br />\\"Bonded by Blood\\" is basically one adrenalin rush from start to finish. Most songs are great, and often even quite memorable if you listen to them one by one (\\"And then there were none\\", \\"Lesson in Violence\\", \\"Metal Command, \\"Strike of the Beast\\", ..) but on the album they blend into such a rollercoaster of excitement and aggression, that after the album is over it's hard to remember any particular highlights.<br /><br />With this head start, Exodus was predicted a rosy future among the very greats of metal. Alas, the over-the-top-but-in-a-stupid-kind-of-way lyrics already testified of the not-too-sane state of mind of singer Paul Bailoff, and in effect he was kicked out soon after making this first album. After this, Exodus reverted to a more normal but also a more boring approach, making \\"Bonded By Blood\\" the main must-have album in their discography until today.
B00005JOX6|5.0|everythin is good about the movie considering the fact that adam sandler is in it. The only problem about this movie is that is is missing one song, whats it called the one where the movie just starts.
1594481717|2.0|The Strenght Based concept is interesting.  Psychobabble, but interesting.  If your company is implementing this strategy, then by all means get this book and read it.  Otherwise, it isn't worth it.  A little self reflection will do the trick.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been a fan since my older brother showed me By The Way, by favourites were \\"Universally Speaking\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\", so when I heard this album was coming out, I was immensly excited. <br />Along came \\"Dani California\\", and that made me so excited to get it, I rushed from work the day of it's release in the U.K, and bought it straight away, I was then in heaven on the 2 hour journey home. <br />I have recently seen the next single \\"Tell Me Baby\\" on T.V, and that song and video matches up too any off their previous work, it's already 39 in the charts after only 1 week off release! <br />I do not understand how they do it, but every album relates in a differant way to, and this album relates the best for me, and don't think I'm not a true fan, I have heard all of their albums, and yes I do agree that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a good album, but this one and By The Way makes me the happiest, even after 22 years, off drugs, sex, band members dying, then maturity, not matter what state there in they pull off every album, these guys are probably the most underated poeple I have heard of. <br />Anyway I am here to prove to you that Stadium Arcadium is a worthy album, firstly Jupiter starts off with \\"Dani California\\" which was the first famous single, then come what is going to be the 3rd single of the album, \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", along with another single going-to-be \\"Stadium Arcadium (the song)\\", so yes you could say the album starts of on a high, but that happens to be not the best bit on the album, as soon comes,  <br />\\"Hump De Bump\\", \\"She's Only 18\\", \\"Warlocks\\" which bring back there funkiness from the likes of Freaky Styley, so that is a like a wind back of time. Standouts on that cd includes, <br />\\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", \\"Dani California\\", \\"Stadium Arcadium\\",  <br />\\"Slow Cheetah\\", \\"Torture Me\\", \\"Wet Sand\\", \\"Hey\\", \\"Strip My Mind\\". <br />Then you swap other the disks from Jupiter to Mars, and then along comes a single going-to-be \\"Desecration Smile\\", which is a very sweet song, and very popular at schools apparently, well from what my son tells me. Then comes \\"Tell Me Baby\\", which is the single off the album at the moment, a video has been made, and appears on alot of T.V music channels. The highlights of Mars include, \\"Storm In A Teacup\\", \\"If\\", \\"Make You Feel Better\\", <br />\\"Animal Bar\\", \\"Turn It Again\\", \\"Death Of A Martian\\",  <br />\\"21st Century\\", \\"Readymade\\". <br /> <br />The only problem you will have on this 2 album set, is swaping the cds over =). <br />Mars is a better cd though. <br /> <br />Overal Grade: 9.8/10
B00005JOSS|5.0|WOW, This movie was so incredible. Hats off to the director and to Rachel Portman with the music. When I left the theater I felt that they had created a work of art rather than a cheap product to be forgotten. Go see The Lakehouse... It is breathtaking.
B0006399FS|1.0|Quite a few years back, the great band Nomeansno sang a song where they told us \\"only so many songs can be sung with two lips two lungs and one tongue.\\"  It seems Bono and company did not bother to listen to these words of wisdom because they keep trying to release more music.  This newest CD proves that the band has lost its touch even though millions of people buy it.  I doubt that would have happened had the song not been forced onto us in commercials.  U2 sold out big time with this one.
B000002KHH|5.0|Critics HATED this band, and sold their promo discs for food money instead of listening to them.  10 years later they were  lining up to sing the praises of BS, like they'd always been there. <br /> <br />The people who loved this music then and still do are now the folks who write about the music.  Amen. <br /> <br />BS made use of repetition and post-Hendrix guitar and group dynamics that drove kids and parents crazy, in their different ways. <br /> <br />If you like Wire or the Ramones, a lot of this may sound familiar.  Metal people tend to prefer Randy Rhodes (he's more of a technician than Tony), but people like me love Iommi's relentless, noisy, double-tracked blues approach.  And when Ozzie was great, he was the best - not the clown he turned into, poor sod.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|After listening to this album, it would seem that Pearl Jam \\"got its groove back\\". If so, where did the groove go? Pearl Jam have consistently made good album after good album, so the fact that this album is great comes off as no surprise. <br /> <br />This is Pearl Jam's heaviest album in a while, at least in the first half, with \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\", \\"Severed Hand\\", and \\"Comatose\\" all with great hooks and head-pounding rhythms. But the slower songs may be even better, with Vedder showcasing his lyrical talent on such masterpieces as \\"Gone\\", \\"Parachutes\\", and \\"Come Back\\". But the album closer \\"Inside Job\\" is the masterstroke of the album, an epic song that finishes on a \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" like note. <br /> <br />Say what you want to say about Pearl Jam being dinosaurs in the alternative rock field; but the truth is, they never missed a beat. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JP0A|4.0|What I enjoyed most about \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is that it's an intelligent movie. It maintains a sense of humor without getting juvenile or patronizing, and in an odd sort of way, it indirectly teaches the audience a valuable life lesson. Specifically, it states that you should live the life you truly want to live. I know how hokey that sounds, considering most go to the movies to be entertained. They rarely go to be given a positive message. But this film had that kind of effect on me, and as strange as it may seem, I actually feel better for having seen it. I initially didn't think I could appreciate a story revolving around the fashion industry. I've never been a part of that world, and I have no idea if its representation in this movie is accurate. But as it progressed, I began to see the big picture, one that has nothing to do with fashion. It has to do with maintaining personal integrity in the midst of a cutthroat world.    In that sense, this movie can be viewed as a satire. But that may be too much of a stretch, because it's one of the subtlest satires I've ever seen. That's because nothing about it is over the top, despite the quirky circumstances and the one of a kind characters. Even Meryl Streep's performance as demonically career-oriented Miranda Priestly isn't overdone. However, her character does have some distinctly caricature-like qualities: she's the impatient, capricious, and cynical editor of the fashion magazine \\"Runway,\\" and she demands much out of her employees. Most of the time it's almost too much, and they are barely able to keep up. (Why else would she be notorious for firing assistants?) Yet she expresses herself quietly and calmly, as if she were completely emotionless. Granted, that kind of demeanor does nothing to lessen the tension her presence inevitably causes. Despite a dedicated staff, it seems that no one is capable of handling such a difficult person.    Then enters Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent college graduate who hopes a job at a magazine will help her on her way to becoming a journalist. The moment she enters the magazine's main New York office, she's bombarded by flurries of activity and demeaning remarks about her sense of fashion (which she receives a lot during the course of the movie). The first person she meets is Emily (Emily Blunt), an outwardly snobby but inwardly insecure British girl who has just been promoted to First Assistant. She clearly doesn't take Andy seriously, and she doesn't expect Miranda will, either. When Miranda and Andy meet for the first time, we're led to believe that Emily was right in how Miranda would feel. Before that day, Andy had never read \\"Runway,\\" nor did she know whom Miranda was. Why should she take part in a magazine she's completely unfamiliar with? Andy leaves the office feeling rejected, thinking it was a complete waste of time. So imagine her surprise when Emily stops her in the lobby and tells her she's been hired.     Thus begins an absolutely whirlwind journey for Andy. She's asked to do a multitude of menial tasks, such as bringing Miranda coffee, picking up articles of clothing, answering the phone, taking messages, and setting up various appointments (among other things). She quickly learns that everything has to be done perfectly and in a timely fashion. Any mishaps or delays meet with intense, ego-shattering criticism, not only from Miranda, but from the other employees, as well. Emily's attempts to brief Andy on technical skills and proper behavior are almost degrading, especially when she gloats about accompanying Miranda to Paris in the spring (for an important fashion show, no less). Encounters with Nigel (Stanley Tucci)--Miranda's wardrobe manager--almost always lead to wisecracks about Andy's figure (she's a size six, which is practically obese in the fashion world). However, their attacks actually do more to teach Andy than they do to defeat her. Gradually, she comes to understand just how this industry works, and to everyone's surprise, she adapts herself accordingly. She wears the correct clothing and dons the appropriate shoes, all the while working to earn the respect of her coworkers (and hopefully Miranda).    But there is one thing she fails to learn: she's paying a pretty high price for success. Being at the mercy of a ruthless boss is driving a wedge between her and her social life, especially when it comes to her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier). From his point of view, she's trying to make herself fit into a preconceived image, in turn making her forget who she really is. The Andy who wore regular, unfashionable street clothes was the woman he loved; she was fun, energetic, and she knew what she wanted to accomplish. But now she wears chic, expensive clothing with gaudy accessories, and she's too busy to spend time with anyone (it reaches a crescendo when she misses Nate's birthday). She's basically trying to reach an impossible standard of beauty, all in the name of success. She initially defends herself, but she eventually realizes that she's sold her soul to the Devil (hence the meaning behind the title).    That's when everything suddenly gets complicated for Andy, especially since Miranda is learning to trust her on a deeper level. She now has privileges most new assistants never come close to earning, including access to a mock up fashion book and no longer having to hang up Miranda's coat and bag. She's even offered Emily's ticket to Paris (I won't say if she actually accepts it). However, Andy is still expected to complete difficult tasks, all of which are getting more and more outrageous; at one point, Miranda asks her to obtain the unpublished manuscript of the next \\"Harry Potter\\" novel (a gift for her twin daughters who refuse wait for its actual publication). The time eventually comes when Andy has to seriously consider what she wants out of life. She also has to decide whom she wants to share it with; in light of the problems she's having with Nate, shefinds herself attracted to Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), the seductive and high profile editor of another New York magazine.    All of the relationships in this movie--be it professional, romantic, or friendly--are complex, a quality I found appropriate given the way real relationships work. No one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype. Even Miranda, as hardened as she is, has another side to her; you might even call it a softer side (but I'm using the word \\"softer\\" loosely, here). Hidden within these various sides is the key to understanding why the character interactions are so important. Essentially, they're important because everyone's concerned about their current lives and their futures. To give a few examples, Nate wants to be a chef, Emily wants to be respected, and Nigel wants the freedom to think for himself. To some extent, we root for all the characters.     But the one we root for the most is Andy, who wants nothing more than to continue writing articles as a real journalist. In witnessing her struggle with the fashion industry, we learn something valuable: we need to be true to ourselves if we want to achieve our goals. It's that aspect of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" that made it an enjoyable movie. While it may not be inspiring enough to change your life, it at least gets you to think about the direction your life is going in. I think everyone needs to do that from time to time. If it takes a movie of wit and wisdom to make that possible, then so be it.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The first time you listen to this album, you're like \\"what the hell!, is this even music!\\". Especial singles such as \\"The Fletcher memorial\\", \\"The prost-war dream\\" and \\"Not now John\\" initially come across as just \\"ear-shattering noise\\". <br /> <br />But \\"The gunners dream\\", \\"The final cut\\" and \\"Two suns in the sunset\\" are good for a starter to gain a feel of the album. Then you gradually start to enjoy \\"Southampton Dock\\", \\"Paranoid eyes\\" and \\"Possible pasts\\".  <br /> <br />Once you're really enjoying the later singles give the rest of them (such as \\"Fletcher memorial\\") a try. It's truly amazing, now you actually enjoy them! <br /> <br />You know how you find a song that you really like and you listen to it so much that you get jaded of it. Well this album is different.

0375831002|5.0|Most amazing novels are simple stories told extremely well. The Book Thief is no different. I, personally, did not care much for I am the Messenger, but Zusak is so much more mature and commanding of the language and artistry with this effort.

Outstanding work of literature.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|This newest version of \\"King Kong\\" takes the old story, with a few twists, and polishes it with superb special effects that create the most human, the most believable, King Kong to date.  Aspiring and desperate actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) accepts a role offered by the shady producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) who promises her exotic travels aboard the ship he has procured.  Likewise, well-known playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is tricked into the trip and thus writing the script featuring Ann and her self-involved co-star.  Unbeknownst to all but the captain and Denham, the ship sails not for Asia but for the legendary Skull Island, where Denham hopes to film a 1930s brand of reality television, complete with bona fide danger and discovery.  What they find there, however, exceeds all expectations.<br /><br />Naomi Watts is radiant and adept in the otherwise thin role of a woman at the mercy of forces beyond her control.  She and Brody have remarkable on-screen chemistry, but she shines most in her Kong scenes, where she charms the enormous beast with her spontaneous antics and, later, her compassion.  Yes, she can scream to rival Faye Wray and Jessica Lange, but director Peter Jackson allows her to act as well.  When she leaves the screen for a prolonged time near the end, the viewer misses her as much as Kong does.  Despite her performance, the real star of this film is digitally created Kong, a creation so realistic and nuanced that one can forget that he is not a real, breathing gigantic gorilla.  His transformation from terrifying brute to an animal who can both be amused by a cartwheel and sit contemplatively before a sunset is one of this film's greatest triumphs.<br /><br />The cinematic atmosphere, in muted colors and Art Deco landscapes, of 1930s New York lends the film a nostalgic texture that fits perfectly with this remake.  Jackson's favorite New Zealand countryside has the raw savagery that seems likely to harbor creatures such as Kong, gigantic bugs, and hoards of dinosaurs.  Despite the technical and artistic elements, \\"King Kong\\" falters because of the story itself, a tale that has always been subservient to special effects.  Its progress is so predictable and lacking of subtlety that, if not for the visual stimulation, the viewer would fall asleep.  In fact, the viewer can probably wander out of the room and return fifteen minutes later without missing anything important.<br /><br />For the sheer exhilaration of Kong's creation and the cinematography, this movie is worth watching -- once.

B00005JOYA|3.0|At first when I heard that a Silent Hill movie is being released I had some worries for it. As you know, most of the video game adaptations so far have failed miserably. Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, House of the Dead, Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within and The Resident Evils-even though I would consider the first resident evil not to be the worst, it just doesnt give us what the Resident Evil video games are made of. Instead it piles in a bunch of zombies into a movie that seems so rushed and pretty pointless. But I still had to see what Silent Hill was like.<br /><br />As I was watching Silent Hill at the cinema I was thinking, can this be true? Did the movie makers actually develop the true meaning of a video game adaptation? The answer is Yes, absolutely. Ok, so it may not be your best horror film or scariest at that, but we werent exactly expecting it to be either. It does however deliver a big package in relation to the Silent Hill video games. Other than the other attempts of video game adaptations, here they really seemed to have taken the Silent Hill series into consideration. You will notice how the video game features are really brought into perspective. The atmosphere of the game is certainly held deeply within the movie, alongside the soundtrack taken directly from the game, brings you to the whole Silent Hill environment, with creatures and characters that seem incredibly accurate to the video game.<br /><br />But even though the CGI was done decent but not spectacular, I couldnt help think that maybe the CGI wasnt needed. As we know CGI can destroy a horror film, not help it. Yet it didnt destroy this film. I suppose they just could have laid a little low on it near the end. There are some scenes in the film I have noticed that was done extremely well without the CGI.(the creepy guy, in the bathroom, crawling along the floor with his feet by his head). Overall, Silent Hill isnt a masterpiece, nor will it have you shiver, but Silent Hill does, finally, deliver a 'great successfully accurate video game adaptation', with atmosphere and eerieness and a whole lot of fun for the Silent Hill fans.at successfully accurate video game adaptation', with atmosphere and eerieness and a whole lot of fun for the Silent Hill fans.

B00004SAAX|5.0|Helmut Walcha was named by TIME as \\"the\\" Bach interpreter for organ. I think that is true more than ever today with all the influences of the French Romantic school, the slam-dunk American style and the avant garde crowd vying for attention.  The recording has a Germanic sound, quintessentially Teutonic in both style and approach.  While Bach sounds different and even magnificent on an Aristide Cavaille-Coll organ it does not sound authentic - or as we perceive authenticity.<br /><br />The fact that the artist is blind(!) means that unlike other folks who can use the music as aids, he must rely on his phenomenal memory. This is truly the stuff of genius. The sonatas are brilliant and I have never heard a better B Minor Prelude & Fugue.  I only wish that his stupendous \\"Kunst der Fuge\\" could have been transferred from record to CD. (Note from 2013***  It has and it is stupendous but without his ending of the last fugue)
B000002LEE|5.0|By the late 1980's mainstream rock was in a bad way.  Cheesy glam metal bands were taking over, each one more indistinguishable than the last.  However, a select few bands emerged in this time, to offer up a much-needed change of pace.  Along with Living Colour, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, and a few others, Jane's Addiction helped give birth to the \\"funk metal\\" genre, combining, as one might guess, funk and metal.  These bands were more creative, more eclectic, more diverse, and just generally a whole heck of a lot better than the average Johnny Suck Poison wannabe band dominating the airwaves.<br /><br />This, the band's proper debut, has since become a timeless classic.  Listening to it today, it's hard to believe it's nearly 20 years old.  \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" is rocking, diverse, original, and tons of fun.  Initially, I pretty much hated Perry Farrel's offkey wails, but in time, I've come to accept, and even enjoy them, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Combined with the mighty Dave Navarro on guitar, and the super-groovin' rhythm section of Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins, you get one hell of a musical force.<br /><br />The album starts off with the trippy guitar-rock intro, \\"Up the Beach\\", moving smoothly into the double hard rock assault of \\"Ocean Size\\" and \\"Had a Dad\\".  Elsewhere, there's plenty of diversity, from the oddly hypnotic \\"Summertime Rolls\\", to the fun, rollicking \\"Standing in the Shower...Thinking\\", to the killer multi-part epic \\"Ted, Just Admit It\\", to the oh-so-mighty funk power of \\"Idiots Rule\\", to the crushing metal of \\"Mountain Song\\" (which Judas Priest recently ripped off with the song \\"Revolution\\") and the vicious closer \\"Pigs in Zen\\".  \\"Jane Says\\" is perhaps the band's most well-known song, and with good reason.  Built around a simple acoustic riff, adorned with subtle steel drums, the band shows a warmer, more heartfelt side, as well as showcasing Navarro's versatility, being able to shred out like a madman, as well as lay back with a tasteful, ear-catching strum pattern.  The short, jazzy instrumental \\"Thank You Boys\\" is pretty keen as well.<br /><br />This is, quite simply, one of the best rock albums money can buy, by one of the most innovative rock bands of the last two decades.  It's unfortunate that this band didn't stay together longer, or make more albums than they did, but they sure made a huge impact in that brief time.  Get all of their stuff.  It is all freakin' great.as lay back with a tasteful, ear-catching strum pattern.

0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men can be interpreted at several levels. It is quite symbolic in nature, serving to show how oftentimes dreams, hopes, can become difficult obstacles. Although Steinbeck narrates in a simple voice, the prevalent themes--isolation, loss of the American Dream, importance of friendship--give the novel a wider range of meaning. George and Lennie's failure to meet their dreams could be aligned with the context in which this novel was written--that is, the many struggles of the migrant workers to find their ideal form of life in the times of the Depression. Lennie's \\"living off the fat of the land\\" is akin to many of the people traveling from Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl to California with bigger and better dreams of daily work and life.  <br /> <br />     The story begins with George and Lennie running away from the town of Weed in California. George is small in stature, but has a \\"street smart\\" persona about him that helps him get himself, and Lennie, out of predicaments. He needs this because Lennie, who is slow in mind but tremendous in size and physical strength, often unintentionally gets them in some sort of trouble, such as accidentally touching a girl's dress. Lennie has a fondness for animals, which shows his innocent intent, but has just gotten blamed for a rape in Weed, which he and George come into the town of Salinas to get away from. They are searching for work to get them back on their feet and moving again. The new ranch could be a solution, but George has to look out to be sure that Lennie doesn't get them in trouble, and he also has to make sure others don't try to get Lennie in trouble. There is the bully on the ranch, Curley, who tries to pick on Lennie when he doesn't speak up. George, although seemingly resenting the fact that he has to be Lennie's parental-type figure, seems to relish in this role. He not only helps Lennie, but helps to keep Lennie's dream alive by telling him it is possible, but helping him relive that dream by repeatedly saying it to him, \\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don't belong no place... With us it ain't like that. We got a future.\\" While on the ranch, George and Lennie begin to find themselves, but not without potential problems from others, such as Curley and his wife. In the end, George has to make a decision that will effect his own livelihood, his own dream.  <br /> <br />     Although small in size (the book is only a little over one hundred pages long), this is a book that teaches about the importance of hope and the essence of sticking together with those who mean the most to you. Another great literary experience from Steinbeck, one which I definitely would recommend giving a try.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I have read through all the reviews so far, and could not believe how many people said Kate Winslet is fat! Argh! Having curves just adds to her beauty; I'd have a harder time believing in a corpse-like leading lady winning Jack's heart. This was 1912, not the body-image-obsessed present day. She is a beautiful woman and looked simply wonderful (albeit she looked a bit older than her movie-age, 17).  <br /> <br />I'm also in the minority here by declaring that I did not see Cal as \\"evil\\". Certainly, he had a temper and a clueless approach to romance, but I believed he genuinely loved Rose, evident by his expressions and the great lengths he went to in an attempt to keep her. Rose didn't have a dime, so it's not like Cal was adding another vast fortune to his own. It seemed to me his major fault was his approach in not treating Rose as a person to cherish but rather more his cherished possession. He finally realized he had a heart in time to have it broken, and reacted accordingly. I was touched when he went down to steerage on the Carpathia, hoping to find Rose among the survivors, and I don't think he was just hoping to get the diamond back. This happens a lot in movies like this- that the fiancee/husband is portrayed as a heartless jerk in order to make the competition more heroic. <br />Otherwise, the movie was dramatic, touching, and heartbreaking, especially the final scene-pure poetry.

B000FA57RG|3.0|The title of Madonna's latest offering is ironic. There's neither secret of Madonna's stupendous showmanship at her million-grossing live shows nor much of her current life. So what's this release for especially when it's about a tour that happened 2 years ago?<br /><br />Whereas most of her previous tours are well-documented on DVD (sans The Blonde Amibiton Tour and The Virgin Tour), the record-breaking Re-invention Tour which forms the basis of the documentary here, is presented as only a soundtrack to the documentary.<br /><br />What fans get will be 14 live tracks, 5 of which are from the American Life era, in their severely edited form. Some of the tracks sound almost indistinguisable from the original studio recordings (Vogue, Die Another Day). Madonna's voice is unquestionably strong on the tour and where she shines on the emotional John Lennon cover Imagine, she is brilliant and earnestly moving. Other noteworthy performance trackes include the much revered Music and the perenial classic Holiday. Into The Groove was good for the large part, but it would do a lot better without the pseudo-hipness of Missy Elliott's rap. I finally have a new found appreciation for the forgotten Nobody Knows Me, which is without a doubt, a roaring highlight of the disc. Finally, the rock version of I Love New York is a nice alternate treat to the one we hear on Confessions.<br /><br />As for the documentary, it is certainly well-shot and segmented by Jonas Akerlund. In it, you'll see that Madonna's reached a new maturity that has become the foundation of her life, though many of the revelations aren't necessarily secrets, if you are looking for any. Interspersed between chapters are interviews, behind the scene footages, rehearsals and concert snipplets, but no concert in full. And the promised Director's Cut of the American Life video is nowhere in sight (you are better here with YouTube). It all adds up to the disappointment considering that the Warner Bros. press release had that on it.<br /><br />As it is with the string of uneventful releases by Warner Bros. and Madonna, Secret might be little too late but still, the documentary succeeds in humanising Madonna, making her less distant to us us folks who love hearing her doing her sing and dance.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|worst movies of all time.  What we get here is a super nerd living in Idaho.  If this is how people are in Idaho I will NOT be visting soon.   <br /> <br />The acting is lifeless.  Some have found that funny but not me.  It scares & saddens me to think that Hollywood can put out this pathetic drool & people actually love it.  There is very little plot & you never develop a caring for any of the characters.  I laughed once through the whole movie.  That is a waste of 90 minutes. (180 really - read below) <br /> <br />But I will gladly spend five minutes to hopefully prevent you from buying this film.  I just saw 'Nacho Libre' it was done by the same producers & it too was AWEFUL .  Must be some bad stuff goin round Hollyweird these days because their idea of a comedy has really taken a nosedive with this movie being the biggest crash of them all. <br /> <br />The lead character has no depth of emotion.  And the other characters in the movie are but sideshows for the giant dork.  I know when I date one of my first questions will be how she liked this film. If she liked it even a little I will be heading down the road. I cannot grasp the kind of mind that finds this dribble funny.   <br /> <br />Bored out of my mind & stupified from watching this movie twice (as recommended is some ealier reviews) got me to thinking about some reviews comparing this movie to 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.  NOT even close.  That was a FAR FAR superior movie. <br /> <br />Again I URGE you to rent this movie first.  If you like it, buy it.  If you HATE it like I did thank me in your prayers this evening.  If this is what 60 % of out country finds amusing I am truly concerned for our future as a society. <br /> <br />PS And PLEASE do NOT click the \\"Did Not Find Helpful\\" Box just because you disagreed with my opinion of this cinematic disaster.  Take it on the chin like the good nerd you are and move forward with your life...............
B000FMGTTE|1.0|Ok, first off, this soundtrack sounds horrible on it's own. I don't even have to listen to the soundtrack to know it is crappy. There is a song that should've been put on this soundtrack and it wasn't. Has anyone forgotten the late Roger Troutman's Superman song that was recorded before his death and was supposed to be used for a movie of the same name? This movie would've been perfect. Thanks Warner Brothers for messing that up. Warner Brothers has a horrible reputation for putting things out of print, or not using songs that are relivent to the same theme. I will not buy this soundtrack unless it is revised and has the mentioned song above on it. Other people might like this soundtrack and that's fine. Not me! Warner? Get it together and pyut Roger's song on it. Bad job on this one Warner. Very very very bad.
1592401791|5.0|Like most people, I enjoy the Beatles music but I am not really a fan. I didn't expect this book to engage me as much as it did. I read it in a day! <br /> <br />The book is well written and easy to read, which I think is the contribution of co-author Howard Massey. Massey has written another great book entitled, \\"Behind the Glass,\\" which is a collection of interviews with top record producers describing how they create hit records. I highly recommend that book as well.  <br /> <br />This book is not technical and is really written to appeal to anyone with an interest in the 60s, the Beatles or the music industry. There are \\"cameo appearances\\" in the book by some other great artists of the times, including Judy Garland and top classical musicians that recorded at EMI studios.  <br /> <br />Some of the other reviews criticize Emerick for his favoritism of McCartney and knocks on the other Beatles. My attitude is that this book is about Geoff Emerick more than anything else. This is a recollection of his personal experiences with the Beatles and is written from his point of view. The fact that his impressions of the four Beatles as individual people don't always coincide with the mythology that has developed aboutt them over the years is interesting and understandable. It makes complete sense to me that Emerick, as a professional recording engineer/producer, would favor McCartney. While I strongly prefer Lennon's music over McCartney's, the fact is that McCartney was the best overall musician of the Beatles. Ask anyone who has seeen McCartney live lately, he effortlessly moves between bass, guitar and piano, and plays them all equally well. Since Emerick worked everyday with some of the world's greatest musicians (he worked with some pretty famous people other than the Beatles), he must have been impressed by Paul's talent.  <br /> <br />Emerick also claims that McCartney was the one Beatle that took the strongest interest in the process of recording. Since Emerick isa professional recording engineer, it makes sense that he would bond with McCartney. Let's face it, if one of the Beatles took a strong interest in what you do for a living, you would think they were the greatest Beatle too! <br /> <br />I rate it five stars. It is well written and gives a fresh perspecitve to the Beatles.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|My guess is that the few bad reviews posted are because of the lack of sex, violence and profanity in this movie.  It's nice, for a change, to simply be entertained and not disgusted by repulsive toilet humor. Hopefully Jared Hess will continue to respect our sensibilities and make more like this.
0141439513|5.0|As a high school student I was not sure I would like this book at all. This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good.
0312319517|4.0|Those who have read previous titles, over the years, will spot a few details inspired  by those titles. They will also feel comfortable with the heavy use of narrational exposition to fill out the characters' motivation and back story. I thought the plot  to be somewhat  contrived to keep up the pace of the drama, but this is typical of thrillers such as this, so it isn't too much of an issue.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I thought there was probably a deeper and better story centered upon aspects of the aid-agencies and the use of prisoners to support the requirements of wealthy foreign thugs residing in despotic states.
B0002IQNAG|1.0|I remember this movie well...for these reasons: It was boring, the effects looked stupid, it had bad acting, and it seemed like an eternity just sitting there watching it. I almost fell asleep.  <br /> <br />The problem is that there is so little excitement in this film, and many parts should've incorporated creepy music or atmosphere. I can't believe anyone would want to remake this film!...Then again...maybe they wanted to try making a version that didn't completely suck... If you want to see a better movie, try Night Of The Living Dead (the original, of course), and also the Evil Dead Series, which is 10 times better than this worthless piece of trash. People who gives this high ratings fathoms the hell out of me. <br /> <br />I hope I've made it all clear to you.  <br />

6305754969|4.0|What could be better...you get to see The Duke riding through beautiful western landscapes....with western towns populated with beautiful women...and bad guys in black hats....plus Robert Mitchum being Robert Mitchum and James Caan with that funny hat and big gun, and they play well with The Duke.  The staging and the filming in technicolor plus the Olaf Wieghorst western art with the opening credits characteristic of the late fifties and early sixties took me back to some great memories of going to the movies as a kid.   A side note...an acquaintance who was working on the set during filming says that John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were not talking to each other...who knows why, supposedly they were friends at one time..during the breaks Mitchum went off with the upper echelon while Duke would lunch with the crew....this is a great DVD to own for those Saturday nites when you feel like watching a fun shoot'm up western...you'll also love Rio Bravo..
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Already had seen this movie before i purchased, and was looking forward to seeing it in english and with added features. The previews are quite enticing, and the behind the scenes etc are also quite cool, worth the purchase. English voices were also very well done, as youd expect on a title this large. definite buy for any FF7 fan, and id also recommend it to any scifi/fantasy/cinematic fans out there too even if they know nothing of ff7.
B00005JOQS|3.0|The scenes are often too long.... Very few humorous lines. No development to Lex Luther story. Scenes of crystals growing and superman flying and enjoying the sun went on way too long and so did this movie.  <br />A couple of very good special effects - saving the plane etc. Its' amazing that after crashing around a plane for 10 minutes...Lois Lane .... doesn't have a bruise or a mark on her! After being kicked and beat up by a thug not a mark or any blood. Maybe she should be superman.:). <br />The original Superman theme by John Williams was used but the rest of the music was very sorely lacking.  <br />I don't recommend spending money to see this in the movie theatre wait for the DVD.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Both the title and the sound of the opening track on 'O' set the tone for what is to follow on Damien Rice's amazing debut album. 'Delicate' is a truly beautiful song, and the intricacy with which it is constructed shows the listener what to expect. <br /> <br />What will touch the listener most about the songwriting is the depth and maturity of the lyrics. Among others, 'Delicate', 'Cannonball' and 'Amie' are intimate testaments to the intricate nature of human relationships, romantic or otherwise. 'Cheers Darlin'' holds a poignancy and an element of hurt and rejection that will find its way into the heart of all listeners, specifically male ones. <br /> <br />Damien Rice uses music more sparingly than many other musicians and to beautiful effect. What some would term the almost minimalistic form of his music, combined with the beauty of his lyrics is at its zenith on the track 'Cold Water' performed with Lisa Hannigan. This is arguably the most moving and powerful track on the album. <br /> <br />The delicacy and subtlety of this debut album is something that will be a pleasure to music lovers. Here's hoping Damien can follow up on 'O' with an album of equal quality.
B00005JOSS|5.0|I loved this movie. It is a great romance story, date flick, with a great twist of time travel science stuff for the guys.... It isn't an academy award winning film but the pairing of Sandra and Keanau again was very effective. I can't wait to get the CD!
B00003CXE7|4.0|The plot of \\"Gladiator\\" has been adequately covered elsewhere -- a devoted and hugely successful Roman general slated to succeed the aging Emperor, is outfoxed by the Emperor's son, enslaved and returns to Rome as a gladiator to exact revenge. I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, with incredible fight scenes including tigers, and an awesome recreation of ancient Rome. It's gotten to the point that you know there is CGI work going on, but you can't tell exactly what it is.<br /><br />The film is superbly casted, from Russell Crowe as the betrayed general to Joaquin Phoenix as cunning young Emperor Commodus, to Giannina Facio who plays Crowe's wife - seen only is a few off-screen moments. The armor and weaponry are terrific as well, being appropriately intimidating and sticking to period themes. The writing was rather workaday, but at least did not detract from the action. The big clich&eacute; of the plotline - hero wreaks havoc to avenge harm to his family - was surrounded by enough new and interesting material not to matter much.<br /><br />The star attraction, of course, was the Roman Coliseum and the games that were held within. As stated earlier, the computer images were utterly realistic, making the place seem perfectly real. The filmmakers also had the wit to allow a bit of emotional depth to the characters  -- for instance, allowing newcomers the time to marvel at the wonder of Roman architecture.<br /><br />The one false note had to do with Commodus's fate and the intent of his enemies.  Though the historical Commodus seems to have enjoyed dressing as a gladiator and had a too-close relationship with his sister, his fate is not as dramatic as portrayed in the film. Neither did Rome revert to a Republic, as implied in the film. These touches were inserted evidently to appeal to Western audiences, but do damage to history in a way that is intolerable - like writing a film in which George Washington builds the Panama Canal.<br /><br />The DVD extras in this edition are rather lame, and are little more than promotions for the film. An in-depth look at the making of Rome in a computer would have been fun and educations, but was not included.<br /><br />Shortcomings aside, the film is riveting and fun. Definitely recommended.in this edition are rather lame, and are little more than promotions for the film.

B0000DZEE3|3.0|This show is awesome.  There is no better way to discribe it.  This is from the By the Way Tour.  They hit it right on the head.  Playing for about 80,000 people is just breath taking in itself, but they pull it off as if they were playing to 100 in a club in LA.  My personal favorite would have to be Purple Stain.  Damn that song is the best on the cd and even rocks more live. <br /> <br />The reason I gave the disc 3 stars, you may be wondering.  I always wonder how some of these reviewers can give low stars and rave about the disc when the stars show it sucks???? <br /> <br />My reason is just basically feature content.  There is no behind the stage, no interviews,  no extras at all.  There is not even a menu.  You pop the disc in and it starts.  I would, at the least, have liked to pick and choose songs. <br /> <br />So my better star assessment is: <br /> <br />5 HUGE SHINEY STARS for the show. <br />1 star(actually a flicker) for the disc content itself. <br /> <br />Thats how I come to the 3 average. <br /> <br />thanks Kiddies and Keep the Faith.  Be-Bop to Bob Dylan!!!

1564148793|5.0|Finally, a book that's not only aimed at Wiccans but witches as well! (If you don't know the difference, you might be part of the problem.) It's so nice to read a book that actually equates witchcraft to a *craft* and not a religion.<br /><br />Anyway, now that that's out of the way, I'll talk about the actual content of the book. This book is exactly what it says it is: a defense manual. While it doesn't go into full-blown cursing, it does present some very interesting techniques of counter-magic. I'll do a chapter by chapter summary now. There are nine chapters in this book, but I'll ignore chapter nine since it's just an epilogue and does not really present any info. Chapter one is titled \\"Recognizing Attack\\" and talks about possible sources and symptoms of psychic/magical attack. Chapter two, \\"Daily Practices,\\" discusses some practices that the author considers to be important, like: meditation, banishing rituals, and offerings (to spirits, etc.). There are techniques offered for each of these if the reader is interested. Chapter three \\"Personal Protection\\" and chapter four \\"Protection for the Home\\" go hand in hand. The first discusses things such as personal shields and cleansing baths while the latter focuses on protecting the home via wards, amulets, and spirit traps. Chapter five, \\"Exorcism,\\" talks about \\"possession\\" and \\"obsession\\" and how to deal with each. It also discusses the dangers of inexperienced (and even experienced) practitioners performing such rituals. Chapter six, \\"Spirit Guardians and Servitors\\" talks about working with various spirits and even creating your own (my favorite magical topic!). Chapter seven, \\"Reversals and Counter-Magick,\\" is the chapter with the most \\"meat.\\" It shows you what to do when everything else fails. And lastly, chapter eight (\\"Healing and Recovery\\") shows you what to do *after* the attack has been successfully averted and how to repair any damage that might have been done.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this book is that the focus of its rituals is the goddess Hekate. I've been interested in this goddess for a couple of years now and it was nice to finally see a book with practices focused around her. \\"Appendix B: Hekate\\" is excellent and it dispels the myth that Hekate is always viewed as a \\"crone\\" goddess. Besides its focus on Hekate, I also like how the book used different traditions/practices throughout, including the always fascinating practice of hoodoo (baths, washes, powders, etc.).<br /><br />Overall, I think that this might be the most interesting meta/magic book I've read so far (and believe me, I've read *A LOT*!). It's obvious throughout the book that the author actually practices what he preaches, unlike many books on the market today that just repeat the same old info over and over again.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to this author's next work.<br /><br />Even if you're not very interested in the topic of protection magic (I wasn't) you will still find this book of great interest and value.<br /><br />A breath of fresh air, indeed!<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />-Aterut this book is that the focus of its rituals is the goddess Hekate.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|My impression of John Mayer before this album were very low - generic acoustic guitar pop aimed soley at the chick market. But then I saw the video for \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\" and thought I should give the album a listen. <br /> <br />I listened and I was impressed. Now I know there are some one star reviews for this album from people that want to compare him to the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, but to do so is unfair. For one Vaughan is dead and therefore an idol, and also Mayer is still pretty young, not to mention the fact that his previous works are completely different from this one. But the fact is Mayer is an accomplished guitar player and a reasonably decent singer, and it's very rare these days for a younger artist to put out this sort of material (i.e. proper music instead of market-driven pap), especially after making a name for themselves as more of a pop artist. <br /> <br />Favourite tracks for me from this album are the slower paced \\"Gravity\\", \\"Daughters\\" and the more up-beat \\"I Got a Woman.\\" <br /> <br />Bottom line is, if you like blues guitar, have a listen, and make your own mind up. I can't wait to see if Mayer puts out another album in this genre.

B000002LCE|5.0|Let's face it, Ronnie James Dio has been through the runaround. The guy has been with 'Sabbath (who are basically the creators of metal), he's sang for Richie Blackmore of Deep Purple fame in the band Rainbow, and now he's turning ears towards his solo project, DIO. I mean, there a lot of awesome musicians out there who went solo (Ozzy, Page and Plant, etc.), and maybe or maybe not those rockers are better than Dio. However, if you want someone who's \\"been there, done that\\" and who has experienced all different kinds of metal, rock, and blues, then this is the guy to look up. All that said, here's a review on a great, no unbelievable metal album.<br /><br />Night People: A couple of keyboard notes here, a little effect there, and all of a sudden, this song races on with the best of 'em. One of the faster rockers on the album (there's quite a few), this song doesn't let up nor let go. The verses are sung fast with blazing guitars flowing over them and then there's a sudden STOP and you who know it can sing with me... \\"Night People!\\" Yeah, this song rocks and happens to be one of my favorites on the album! 9.5/10<br /><br />Dream Evil: As a Dio song itself, I believe it is a very impressive song. It's got a great, catchy riff, powerful lyrics during the verse, and a sweet chorus. I do not think, however, that this deserves to be a greatest hit. Yes, it's the title track, and yes it's a great song, but I would pick many songs on this album to be a greatest hit before this song. Don't get me wrong, Dream Evil is a great Dio song, with solos, catchy riffs, and everything else we love about the band, but it is just a tad too weak to be deemed a \\"greatest hit.\\" Still a blistering 9/10!<br /><br />Sunset Superman: This song is often overlooked by Dio fans. Don't ask me why, because I think it's quite a powerful Dio tune. It's definitly has its moments (like the repetitiveness towards the end), but overall it is a solid song. The chorus is very catchy, and the main riff is sweet. Not a mediocre song at all though; 8.5/10.<br /><br />All the Fools Sailed Away: Here's a spectacular song! This is the ballad off the album and it's one of the most meaningful and powerful ballads I've heard. You can just tell Ronnie put a lot of effort into writing and singing this beauty! The guitar during the verses is heavy, though slow, and the vocals are really distriputed well as far as tone and range. The chorus is also very well done, and it's really sweet that Dio got a group to sing a very of the chorus' with him. Also a little side note: This song is on the Dio: Anthology along with Dream Evil. It's just kind of sweet, because it's not the \\"expected\\" song. A perfect 10/10!<br /><br />Naked in the Rain: This is also probably my top three on the album! It's just really meaningful, heavy, and an all-around good Dio song. The guitar during the chorus is very catchy and you'll be singing \\"We're Naked in the Rain\\" all day. I really like the vocals during the verses' also; just something special. Another 10/10!<br /><br />Overlove: This is another one of those fast-paced rockers like Night People. Fast, speedy guitar work throughout the whole song and a solid structure as well. Gotta enjoy the solos and the start/stop method during the transition between the verse and chorus. Easily a 9.5 outta 10!<br /><br />I Could Have Been a Dreamer: This is probably one of Dio's weakest songs. Another song that, in my opinion, should not have been a greatest hit. The opening riff is sweet, and the verses' are really interesting and good, but what kills this song is the lullaby-esque chorus. I apologize to those who really like this song, but in my opinion it's a little weaker than most. Still not unlistenable though so it gets a 7.5-8/10.<br /><br />Faces in The Window: Finally we get to the goods. This masterpiece could possibly be my favorite Dio song ever next to Rainbow in the Dark, Rock n Roll Children, and Last in Line. Another speed metal-esque rocker that races on and on. The verses are very consuming and catchy, but the chorus is just phenomenol. The line \\"Faces in the Window, Noises in the Night, Faces in the Window, Hiding from the Light!\\" is almost always in my head. 10/10!<br /><br />When a Woman Cries: Quite a good song! Not one of my favorites on the album but it's difinetly above mediocre. Good chorus, with not so strong of a verse, it's a good, but not great Dio song. Just a suggestion, but I would have closed the album off with \\"Faces in the Window\\" or \\"All the Fools Sailed Away.\\" A solid 8.5/10.<br /><br />  >So get this album along with Holy Diver, Last in Line, and Sacred Heart.

B000GCFO0I|4.0|I have seen many horror movies and this one scared me so bad I fell out of my seat. Some parts are kind of confusing but it was scary. The ending is surprising and one of the parts I did not like.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is a monument in rock history as a work of both structured and spontaneous instrumentation, and of course, a concept album. It is indeed a production masterpiece, with so many musical elements and distinctly great songs, even as they blend so well into a unified work. The verselines are more easygoing, the instrumentation varied, more often with a sort of jazzy or jazz/rock feel, occasionally with good rock soloing--check out David Gilmour's guitar in \\"Time\\" and \\"Money,\\" for example, the latter of which is the \\"normal\\" rock song.<br /><br />The overall theme is difficulty and madness in everyday life. Pink Floyd is comprehensive in addressing subthemes of troubling aspects of human relations and existence: aging and death, greed and corruption, hate and war, and of course, \\"lunacy.\\" This is set against a backdrop that seems to constantly emphasize isolation in vast spaces. Look at those broad, elaborate images in the song titles: air, time, sky, color, the moon (the sun is subordinated, appearing in the song lyrics only ephemerally). The music is usually distant, often softly sweeping and otherworldly, filling all surrounding horizons. Actually, in only parts of this album does one feel as if there is ground below.<br /><br />The human side of things is also in the song titles: speaking, breathing, money, brains, companionship (OK, time qualifies here too). Then the sound effects: the album begins and ends with a heartbeat, no less. The cash register before \\"Money,\\" the clock before \\"Time,\\" we are being taken on a trip in which all the tracks neatly flow into the next, punctuated by a consistently somber mood and usually soft, smooth vocals, Gilmour's being the most so and the most prominent. Roger Waters kicks in at the end in \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse.\\"<br /><br />But, hey, \\"Dark Side\\" is a production masterpiece for its great music, first and foremost. Was so much ever combined within 43:01, so many different musical elements, so skillfully? Listen to that vibrating, circular synthesizer that makes up \\"On the Run.\\" Listen to Dick Parry's jazz saxophone in \\"Money\\" and Richard Wright's beautiful piano work in \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" in which Clare Torry's rangy vocals accentuate and contribute to a compellling mood. The percussion: Yes to the Roto-toms of Nick Mason leading into the verse on \\"Time.\\"<br /><br />It is the beautiful \\"Us and Them\\" that is Dark Side's finest moment, with its stunningly exquisite, gorgeous texture. Wright and Parry carry the day, while the chorus ladies contribute a majestic background as the melody is crescendoed into dramatic cadences. The great synthesizer work of \\"Any Colour You Like\\" then leads to \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse,\\" the finale, as sweeping music mirrors Waters' all-encompassing chants about all aspects of life and existence that are then ultimately ...

B000AADYRQ|3.0|<br />I missed Death Cab in their debut year, however I am quite familiar with most of their material, having listened to them quite a bit in the past 4 or 5 years. And I have to admit, when I first bought Plans, I was somewhat disappointed. It seemed a little less 'experimental' than some of their older songs (for example 'Line of Best Fit', 'Photobooth' or 'We laugh indoors'), and a little more easy listening. I was perplexed when I heard 'I will follow you into the dark' (a sad, acoustic song that hasn't got much texture to it).. but then, strangely, the album grew on me. especially after seeing them live, and hearing 'I will follow you into the dark' sung by the hundreds of people at the venue... I'm pretty sure that everyone attending that gig was singing along at one point or the other, and there was such energy, that I was unable to listen to that album in the same way again. The Winner with Death Cab is Ben Gibbard's ability to put beautiful moments into words and expressing feelings perfectly through his lyrics, like in the beautiful opening song 'Marching Bands of Manhattan'(which makes you want to be the girl he's singing this song to): If I could open my mouth/Wide enough for a marching band to march out/They would make your name sing/Bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings. <br />Ben still uses awkward and bizarre metaphors the way he's been doing previously with Death Cab and with his side project, The Postal Service, and as always, they work perfectly. <br /> <br />As for any The Postal Service fans... well my advice is, if you liked 'Give Up' and are trying to get something similar, 'Plans' is probably your best bet, even though it's quite a bit less electronic but still more accessible and 'pop' than any other album of theirs, and the songs aren't as polished as they are in 'Give Up' (which, by the way, is one of the best achievements of Ben's, regardless of it being a side project, as well as an album that was never recorded with thewhole band together in the studio). If you are looking for things as experimental as their earlier records, you won't find them here.. but get the album anyway, it might surprise you the way it surprised me. <br />
B000ESSTL0|5.0|At last, \\"Violator,\\" the most successful and most acclaimed album from Depeche Mode, gets the remastering it richly deserves.  When this CD was released in the Spring of 1990, it's multiplatinum success was all but assured.  With a rapidly growing fanbase and following a wildly successful 12-inch single, \\"Personal Jesus,\\" Violator shot straight to the Top Ten on Billboard's album chart and sold millions around the world.  Rhino/Warner did a decent job remastering this CD, which features \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" \\"Policy of Truth,\\" \\"Halo,\\" and \\"World in My Eyes\\" like you never heard them before.  Even better, is the excellent half hour documentary, which features current interviews with the band (including departed Alan Wilder), producer Flood, and Anton Corbijn, who's directed most of Depeche Mode's videos and does the artwork for many of their albums.  The DVD also has the entire album in 5.1 surround sound, with b-side tracks including \\"Dangerous,\\" \\"Happiest Girl,\\" and \\"Sea of Sin.\\" (The b-sides are NOT on the CD)  So if you're a fan of the Mode and if you love \\"Violator,\\" it's not a question of IF you should get it.  It's a question of WHEN and how quickly.  Revisit this landmark album and get violated for a second time.

And furtwangler's tempi are always right on the money.  <br /> <br />So if you want to see a modern production with Don Giovanni happening on the moon then this is not for you. <br />If you like singers that sound bad due to lack of vocal technique then this is not for you. <br />If you like your acting over the top and vulgar than this is not for you. <br /> <br /> However if you like excellent singing and tasteful artistry than this is not only the best Don Giovanni you will ever see. It is the best production of any opera ever.
B00005JP0A|1.0|Andrea has just graduated from college and opens up her day planner to realize she has an appointment for an interview with Runway Magazine. She somehow gets hired despite being totally inappropriate for the job of Editor-in-Chief Miranda's Priestly's second assistant. She's required to get coffee, hang up Miranda's coat, and many other personal details which have nothing to do with the magazine, but make Miranda's personal life easier.<br /><br />Although based on the book, the film tries to show Miranda being vulnerable and not a complete bitch every second of the day as in the book, she was. A few things have been changed or added: Andie now lives with her boyfriend, who's a chef instead of a schoolteacher of nine-year old first graders (check with the author of the book on that one), and her best friend is an artist instead of a drunken loser. There's also a male character (Stanley Tucci) who's been working under Miranda for 18 years who tries to buck Andie up when she whines at how Miranda never appreciates her.<br /><br />Other things stick: Andie thinks that after one year as Miranda's assistant (and so she is told in the book) that she automatically becomes a writer for any magazine she chooses (and if she can't write for a magazine, it doesn't matter because she'll write a tell-all badly written, boring book).<br /><br />This film is shallow, depressing, and goes nowhere - just like the book.  The ending is changed to try to give the story some redeeming value, but it fails.<br /><br />The acting isn't bad (even Gisele Bundchen is credible in a small part), but with the lame story the actors had to work with, it's a waste of Meryl Streep. And she's the only reason anyone would see this superficial movie.
1594481938|1.0|This book was one of the most painful things I have ever read.  I have loved other Hornby books so I kept hoping that I would start enjoying this book but it never did happen. <br /> <br />Simply put - I never began liking any of the characters and really couldn't care less what happened to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0307263118|2.0|At the recommendation of a friend, and after reading the many glowing reviews of Banville's work, I ordered \\"The Sea\\" and eagerly awaited its arrival. When it did arrive, I hastily tore it out of the box, and headed to my favorite place to read -- the bathtub. Twenty minutes later, I had set the book aside, and just enjoyed the bath. <br /> <br />Several times since then, I have valiantly attempted to find some sense of compassion or connection with the characters in the book, and it is impossible for me. When I say \\"The Sea\\" is masterfully written, I mean that the sentences are carefully constructed, and the vocabulary is rich and varied. But this is one very cold example of writing for the sake of writing, rather than to convey a moving or necessary story. <br /> <br />I have set this book aside for more fulfilling books...
6305531374|4.0|This movie ignores Halloween 3-6 and continues after number 2. No more thorn and cults its back to Micahel killing for no reason at all. It starts out marion Chambers the nurse from the first 2 coming home her house broken into and shes scared so she has her neibor check it out for her. Nothing is there she goes in and Michael gets her.  <br /> <br />Then we go to Laurie Strode and her son in California. She changed her name and is teaching at a prep school. Michael finds her because of some papers in Marion Chambers house. It is as close to the original. Overall it is a very good movie.
0060931736|5.0|A lovely story of growing up and growing away from some of our most powerful influences.  With a mixture of sadness and humor, this poignent tale of love, lives lived and unlived and the necessity of betrayal is quietly and deeply moving.

B000059Z8J|4.0|The original Superman:The Movie I give 5 Stars: without a doubt a monumental movie.  This version, while technically great, cuts in too many (wisely cut in the first place) extra scenes and extended versions of existing scenes placing a drag on the pacing.  The original theatrical cut is considered by Richard Donner to be his 'director's cut': this version is more of a curiosity piece.  Film students could watch it to learn something about film editing and pacing.  I saw the original movie at least 15 - 20 time during it's theatrical release and feel Warner's has almost ruined the film with this presentation.  Let's hope Warner's releases the theatrical cut on the upcoming (fall 2006) Ultimate Superman collection.  One thing I will say I did like was the audio remix for Dolby 5.1.  Although I'm a purist concerning this film, they did a great job remixing the dialogue, sound effects and music.
B00012BSHG|5.0|I got this pool for our back garden - I have a toddler and I'm heavily pregnant - I wanted a pool that was comfortable for both of us to sit in.  And it's PERFECT. <br />The aircushioned bottom is great for letting my toddler jump and land and splash around without hurting himself, and the sides are robust enough for me to lean against. Also they are robust enough for him to lean against from the outside and play with his boats in the pool (obviously only when supervised!) Because of the cushioned bottom, I could quite easily spend hours justing sitting in there; it's really comfortable.   <br />We got a little electric pump and it took no time to pump up, and although it takes a while to empty the water out of the bottom valve, you can do it without any effort (no heaving and tugging to turn it upside down). <br />We're really happy with it.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Definately an experience worth talking about, Richard Linklater has a unique voice and through his imagination you find you are in a place you could not have created on your own.<br /><br />This movie will not be liked by everyone, as a metter of fact - I had problems when I watched it the first time... But you can't deny that this movie sparks curiosity. I can't wait for his new movie A SCANNER DARKLY.<br /><br />I would not have appreciated this movie without taking a class on screen writing and I believe if have the patience you should really give this director a chance. Whther you like it or hate it  - this movie will open you up to something new!
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|I was expecting Aeon Flux(terrible) too be like this.To sum this up quick, if your a fan of matrix style sci-fi, kung fu,gun fu,and samurai style action this is great.Kurt Wimmer is a great director and filmed this movie in china which explains why some people won't like the CGI effects(Who cares it's just a movie).Remember this won't be nominated for an Oscar, it's for die hard fans of this genre. This could probably win an MTV movie award for best fight sequence,Also check out Kurt Wimmer's previous movie \\"Equillibrium\\" a great introduction too his world.
B00006FDCJ|3.0|It seems to me it is a film so full of itself that it was concerned from the start it would be considered for greatness..\\"Unforgiven\\"reminds me of a very different film years ago called \\"The Verdict\\"in that way;it seems to have been made with Oscar in mind..It is dark and violent  ,and sometimes unintentionaly camp(some of the lines are so obviously meant to be legendary , it reminds me  of a Mad magazine take-off) Do the girls playing the  1880`s prostitutes really look  like you`d imagine the  real mean thing did from those days or did someone page the set of \\"One Life To Live\\" in central casting?Or the blind, sharp shooting hombre?Now there was a real hoot! Where was Dennis Hopper when Clint needed him?But there are some entertaining performances in it (Hackman and Harris and the ever reliable Morgan Freeman.Buy it for that and the very good(though dark)transfer.The film  for me,however, was a real disappointment.3 bullets.If you want a  realistic western,rent out \\"The Wild Bunch\\"or Brando's \\"One Eyed Jacks.\\"
0345349571|5.0|A fantastic history of the 14th century.  A must read for any history buffs.  By following the life of Coucy, a particular Frankish knight, Tuchman takes us through all of the major events of the 14th century from the Hundred Year's War to the Great Plague to Nicopolis.  By following through the eyes of Coucy, she makes the story more person than is typical for a historical work and the reader finds him/herself caring for the well-being and outcome of particular individuals rather than merely being seeped in facts and figures.      The Calamitous 14th century is clearly one of Tuchman's best works, and indeed I enjoyed its prose more than \\"The Guns of August\\".  For those who enjoy medieval history, in particular, this is an excellent selection to buy for oneself or to find under the Christmas tree.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|And now for something completley different... <br />A good compliment to Emmylou's \\"Duets\\" CD, <br />the Hank Williams \\"Timeless\\" tribute <br />and the Notting Hillbillies. <br />If you like any of those, you'll probably  <br />like this also.  <br />Not the most energetic of Knoplfer's works, <br />but like most of his music, it has a tendency <br />to grow on you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0812550757|5.0|Ender's Game was fantastic, five stars. <br />Speaker for the Dead is fantastic, five stars, but in totally different ways. <br /> <br />I just finished going through this book a second time and it holds up remarkably well.  (And if you want to enjoy it even more, listen to the amazing unabridged audio version of it, available here and at Audible.) <br /> <br />Card constructed a wonderful conceptual world and parcels out the details in a perfectly-paced manner throughout the book.  Knowing the answers to all the questions the second time through, I was interested to see all of the clues sprinkled throughout that lead you toward the answers, if you're paying close enough attention. <br /> <br />There are four scenes in particular that I enjoy and that make up a large chunk of the book; they are so compelling and well-written that portions of them still give me chills. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about this book, and I can't poke any holes in it.  As an earlier reviewer said, one problem it has is that it leaves you hanging for the third book, even though Card has said that he originally never intended to write a third book.  Would that he had held true to this.  Don't let your curiosity get the better of you; the third (and fourth) books don't answer any questions or solve any problems in a satisfying way. <br /> <br />But this one?  Highly recommended.
B0000033TE|5.0|Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the early to mid 70's made a series of albums that in my mind are classics and always will be. <br />All of their albms are outstanding and many would argue which is best. <br />My personal favorite would be Brain Salad Surgery. <br />As usual Keith Emerson blows you away with his keyboards and Carl Palmer drums endlessly along. <br />To me the highlight is Greg Lake playing \\"Still you turn me On\\" on his acoustic guitar. They always had an acoustic song on every album and this would be my personal favorite. <br />Kark Evil goes thru several movements and could be Emerson's finest hour on the keyboards as well. <br />The only problem with ELP is that once you buy an album you have to buy them all, well at least the first 4. <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is by far the most thought out album I've heard by Pat. It is not his usual style, but it still comes out great. This album definately desreves that grammy. The music moves smoothly up and into the clouds. Like I said, it's not the usual sound you'll hear out of Pat, but it is still an awsome suite.
0792162803|5.0|Because of my disappointment with some SNL movies (The Ladies Man, A Night at The Roxbury) I really wasn't expecting much out of Superstar.  Boy was I in for a huge surprise.  This movie was hillarious.  It stars Molly Shannon as Mary Katherine Gallagher whose dream in life is to be kissed.  Will Ferrell is also in this, which only makes the movie funnier than it already is.  Mary Katherine Gallagher's actions in this movie are absolutely hillarious.  I would definetely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a very funny movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|I loved it the first time I heard it, (when I was in the 9th grade, 37 years ago) and I still love it.  One of the best albums from one of the greatest groups ever.  I realize that many rock critics may think the Beatles are over rated, but it is hard not to like them.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|There hasn't been a film yet made of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" that does the book justice.  So the makers of this film came up with a good idea.  Make up a new story with some of the characters from the book (including the vampires), and throw in Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and Werewolves.  It all makes for a very fast paced and entertaining film.  Kind of a cross between James Bond, Constantine, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in the 19th Century.<br /><br />Whereas Bond serves for Her Majesty, the Queen of England, Van Helsing gets his license to kill, and his peculiar armaments, from the Vatican.  After eliminating Mr. Hyde at Notre-Dame de Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to terminate Count Dracula, who is trying to use Dr. Frankenstein's science to bring his thousands of still-born vampire children to life.<br /><br />It isn't stuff for the Academy Awards, but it is good fun!
B00005JOQS|2.0|Special effects were great, but the first half was pretty slow and there were some attempts at humor, but it was not very funny at all...also he didnt use his superbreath to freeze anything!

B000F6IOC0|5.0|What can I say about Underworld: Evolution that hasn't already been said.  A great film, a great story, a great sequel to an almost flawless series.  This film is a direct continuation from the first film so it gives the impression of one big movie when watched together.  Watching the first one will help in understanding the story.  I believe there are some confusing points, but does not impact the plot all that much or the overall greatness of the film. <br /> <br />More hybrid Michael, more action, much more of Selene, more fun <br />Any fan of the original, vampires, werewolves will enjoy this film. Highly recommended and a must own. <br /> <br />A loyal fan.
3438052199|5.0|In the field of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament studies, 'BHS' carries a well-deserved resonance, much like 'Mercedes' or 'Beamer' does among enthusiasts of quality cars that are within the mainstream.<br /><br />The Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft's BIBLIA HEBRAICA STUTTGARTENSIA has no rivals except its own periodic updates. Like Mercedes and BMW, each edition represents improvements made to a venerable tradition, in this case one that associates its name with the renowned German scholars Alt, Eissfeldt, Kittel and their successors.<br /><br />Following introductions in the major European languages and indices to the sigla that one uses to follow the textual information presented in the two 'apparati' (running footnote references) on each page of the text, one launches without comment into the biblical text itself. The gruntwork of editing and annotating each biblical book has been placed into the hands of particular scholars. As a result, the reluctance or daring with which the editors present evidence gleaned from Hebrew manuscripts and the early versions varies, but always within the general parameters established by the Biblica Hebraica tradition.<br /><br />BHS is a 'diplomatic' edition. This means that a given text is presented as received. The apparati then provide the scholar with data from which he or she chooses to opt for a different 'reading' at any point along the way. The text in this case is variously known, but commonly called 'Leningradensis', a superb 11th-century manuscript in the Massoretic tradition. It is the earliest complete exemplar of the Massoretic biblical/textual tradition, thanks to the wear and scarring suffered by its slightly older cousin, the Aleppo Codex.<br /><br />BHS is not a visual 'copy' of Leningradensis - one of this is available - but rather a machine-type presentation of that manuscript's contents. The quality of workmanship is awe-inspiring.  Though I have worn out my share of BHS's, this is due to intensive use and occasional mistreatment in a backpack or overstuffed briefcase. I can scarcely imagined a more durable book.<br /><br />The Gesellschaft will eventually produce the successor to BHS, to be titled BIBLIA HEBRAICA QUINTA. It will provide its reader with even more textual data, much of it gleaned from the Dead Sea manuscripts.<br /><br />Quinta will earn its welcome. However, it is only with deep nostalgia that I will cede pride of place to the Quinta after having journeyed so long and contentedly with the incomparable BHS.stuffed briefcase.

0071373586|4.0|Hi everyone! I'm an MBA student and this book helped me very much on a project i had about positioning. I haven't finished reading the book yet but i can tell its a very good one! It is very illuminating and well written. I recomend this book to everyone who likes psycology and analyzing human behaviour.
0786860707|5.0|An absolutely gorgeous book, I stumbled across it in my university's library and curled up right there in the aisle with it and read for hours.  I knew I had to have a copy of my very own once I got home for summer break and found myself longing to find myself back in that aisle.  Beautifully done, it isn't just a bland history of Disney's animation--it's written by two men who were actually there through it all and who helped mold the art of animation with their very own hands.  This book is a fun read and shows the reader just what makes every Disney film created such a masterpiece of artwork.
0747582882|3.0|In this book the author relates how she was shattered and depressed during the last portion of her marriage and the divorce that followed. Finally, she decides to turn her life around by taking a year off and eating food in Italy, staying in her guru's ashram in India, and visiting a wise old medicine man in Indonesia. This is the story of her quest for enlightenment and peace.  <br /> <br />Quote: \\"Look for God, suggests my Guru. Look for God like a man with his head on fire looks for water.\\"  <br /> <br />My feelings about this book are really mixed. I thought the writing was excellent- right amount of detail, witty, charming, funny, but still the story itself often lagged and was only saved by the good writing. I expected the book to be more focused on the travels of this woman through Italy, India, and Indonesia- I didn't realize it was so centered around her quest for enlightenment. I got very tired during the chapter about studying in her guru's compound in India, although I do admit that I might have a lingering bias against guru's after reading My Life in Orange earlier this year. I enjoyed the Indonesia chapter the most (the Italy chapter was entertaining, but so narrow! I like gelato as much as anyone, but there are other nice things in the country too).

1400079179|3.0|The plot is around a conspiracy theory about Roman Catholic church, specifically Opus Dei order, trying to hide the role of Mary Magdalene, in their struggle against another secret organization (whose name escapes me) attempting to preserve the \\"true\\" story.<br /><br />I have no opinion one way or the other as to whether there is much merit to the theory/story, it may be true for all I know - I'm not even a Christian.  But reading the book, I'm constantly reminded of the resemblance with the Illuminati trilogy, the goofy 70's (60's?) mother of all conspiracy theory tome.  The author seems to progress along the other themes on the Illuminati trilogy - I hear that one of his later books is printed in Germany with the title \\"Illuminati\\".<br /><br />It's a knock-off, marketing-sanitized for the mass market today.  Still a decent page turner, though.

B000005ALP|5.0|I purchased this album used in 1997 having liked the songs \\"Novacaine for the Soul\\" & \\"Rags To Rags\\" which both played on the local alt-rock station.  Once I put it in my Cd player it stayed in there for a month as I loved it, every song was to my liking.  The stand outs besides the before mentioned songs for me were \\"Guest List\\",  \\"Not Ready Yet\\", & \\"Your Lucky Day In Hell\\".   I then went out and bought E's earlier albums.  \\"Broken Toy Shop\\" and \\"A Man Called E\\", both were pretty good although I greatly prefered \\"Broken Toy Shop\\" to \\"A Man Called E\\".  If you like this album I would suggest these two to you.    <br />Interesting enough I found when visiting their web site in 1997 I found this album posted in a new sound format (mp3) my first encounter with this now mainstream format and before it was endlessly traded on the many file sharing networks that would later spring up and hurt bands like the Eels.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|In the great scheme of things, this movie is hardly a blip on the radar.  <br /> <br />The costumes are fairly unique. The fact that the sun is shining in a post apocolyptic world is novel. The storyline forces you to reason parts of why certain things happen are only because they are in the script.  <br /> <br />Charlize looks pretty doing wirework. She's a trained ballet dancer and it shows - but there is nothing ground breaking here in the way of special effects.  <br /> <br />Still, if you can suspend every fiber of disbelief you own, it's an okay movie. Fun summer fluff with a pretty girl in tight clothes. Lots of butt-kicking and a sappy love story thrown in to appease the women folk who like that sort of thing. <br /> <br />I would say it's worth the purchase, if you don't have to pay new release prices for it.
B000FGGE68|5.0|NOTE:  This review is for the Unrated, Extended Cut version) <br /> <br />I don't understand why there are such poor reviews of this movie.  I thought it was very inventive and unique.  I'm so sick of people bringing up past movies and comparing new movies to them.  How many more million times must people compare movies to The Matrix?!  Can't people remember farther back than that?  I mean come on people, get some perspective on movies. <br /> <br />Ultraviolet is an awesome movie in and of itself.  Great story, great execution.  Some of the CGI isn't up to the standards of a lot of the high budget movies today, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all.  The sets are very inventive and colorful.  Like Equilibrium before it, Ultraviolet gets an A+ for style and execution.  The fight scenes are very pleasing.  The gun kata scenes (see Equilibrium) are great.  I went into this movie expecting much worse.  By the end of the movie I must say I was very pleased with the experience and find many bad reviews unwarranted.  I think Ultraviolet is destined to become a cult classic along the same vein as Equilibrium has. <br /> <br />I think people need to seek more out of a movie on its own merits rather than comparing it to something else (*cough* Matrix *cough).  I think people have become spoiled and are easily disappointed if a movie doesn't up the bar another notch.  Movies are entertainment, not benchmarks.  Ultraviolet is a movie about a comic book character and world.  It immerses you into that world and makes you feel for the characters.  It has great special effects and more style than many movies could ever hope to have.  I believe this movie deserves way more than people are giving it.  So with that I'm giving it 5 stars to help counterbalance the posers.  And yes, I truly believe it deserves 5 stars. <br /> <br />You can agree to disagree, but I challenge you to watch the movie without trying to compare it to something else.  People today are spoiled rottenand it shows with some of these reviews.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|For me, this film was an emotional rollercoaster.  As I was watching the movie, I felt happiness, lust, love, sadness, anger, emptiness and finally lonliness.  It didn't matter that it was two men, those human emotions touch all - gay, straight, bi, trans.  It's a movie that crossed boundries and I am so thankful for that.  Did it change some people's perceptions of gays?  Time will tell. <br /> <br />Heath and Jake both gave powerful performances (not to mention they are quite easy on the eyes too!).  You truly felt their attraction and love for each other and you wanted them to finally be able to stay together.  I was soooo sad at the end of the movie.  And when a movie touches me like that, it remains with me long after it's over. <br /> <br />Like I said, it was an emotional rollercoaster - I'm glad I was along for the ride.

B00005JOSS|5.0|Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock) both inhabit a modern glass house situated on a beautiful lake. Kate leaves it as Alex moves in. Alex receives a letter from the former tenant asking him to forward her mail to her new address in Chicago should the postal service fail, and she apologies for the dog's prints on the floor and box of stuff in the attic. Alex finds no dog prints or box in the attic but he does begin a correspondence with Kate which changes lives because Alex lives in 2004 and Kate in 2006. This subtle clue is followed by others including the situation that unlike modern professionals, Kate and Alex do not email nor seem to own a computer, a clue that this story is not the typical boy meets girl. And there is a traffic accident on the first day of Kate's new job and she aids a man who has been hit by a bus who later dies in her arms. It too is a clue that foreshadows what is to come in a convoluted story that transcends the ideas of time and space as scientific, empirical, and measurable. <br /> <br />Thoroughly believable are the mature actors Reeves and Bullock, a couple with enormous screen charisma. Long ago women noticed the boyish Keanu's great leading man looks and waited for him to mature into a handsome, sensitive, and older man. This fact is never more enjoyable than this film which provides both actors with great solo moments of on screen time. Sandra Bullock has lost her girl next door cuteness replaced with a face that is mature and enormously attractive, not beautiful, but interesting to see as life unravels around her despite a successful medical career. Both personalities have tremendous believability and their give and take echos the brief snips of the ultimate screen lovers, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman from Hitchcock's Suspicion, and in literature with Jane Austen's Persuasion. This is screen chemistry at its best. Th elegant Christopher Plummer is Keanu's cold, brilliant and distant architect father, who the son comes togrieve by elevating the design of his father's glass house into a home for Kate. How this comes to fruition is the gist of the film. <br /> <br />If 4 U, 2+2=4, this film might not be enjoyable but if the possibility that 2+2=x, this could be your kind of off-center love story. Tears, sniffles, and an audible \\"aw\\" were discernible in the theater where I screened this film, and it was an enjoyable group catharsis when the lights came up to discover numerous individuals quickly wiping tears with sheepish smiles. So what if the dog plays chess, the book under the floorboard has no logical explanation, and the characters could not possibly be situated in time two years apart. I did not see the word \\"documentary\\" in the descriptions, nor that films in general were irrefutable and factual recordings of the laws of physics. This is a love story, a sweet one at that and as entertainment, I enjoyed the actors, characters, and the house. With a minor role, Dylan Walsh of TV fame makes a small role thoroughly forgivable as the stuffy, controlling attorney boyfriend, Morgan, but on screen, this is Keanu Reeves and Sandy Bullock's most excellent movie.

B000028U0Y|5.0|If you are a Johnny Cash fan, there are two items that are a must-have for your collection, his concert at San Quentin Prison and his concert at Folsom Prison. This CD is the complete concert at Folsom, and it is historic. Cash defied everybody when he decided to do this show, and I am still amazed that he did it and did it so well. If you're a Cash fan and don't have this CD or the CD of the San Quentin concert, I highly recommend that you buy both!!!!
B00004RF8J|5.0|It's a musical, it's a horror film, it's a love story and because it's all three it's a comedy! It's \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\", the Frank Oz film based on the 1982 David Geffen produced musical based on the 1960 Roger Corman film. I've loved this film ever since I first saw it. It's colorful, its funny, its goofy, its got Rick Moranis and its got some great puppetry in it. All that and the songs are catchy and quotable too! <br /> <br />Awkward but kind hearted Seymour (Rick Moranis) works at a gardening shop along with sweet, passive Audrey (Ellen Greene) and gruff Mr Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). He works there, yes, but there's not really much to do, as the store doesn't get a single customer. On the day of an unexpected solar eclipse, however, Seymour finds a very special, very unusual plant in the wholesale plant markets, kind of like a Venus flytrap except he can't identify exactly what it is. He takes it back to the gardening shop, names it Audrey II, and puts it in the window, where its exotic features attract the passers by into the shop, and soon they are back in business. Little does Seymour know that this plant is mean, green and from outer space and feeds on human blood! Not only that, it can talk and sing (vocals by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops) and it is very persuasive. Will Seymour be seduced by this spacey shrub? Will Audrey II get its fill of blood? Will this innocent shop become a little shop of horrors? <br /> <br />I love 1980s comedies and 1980s comedians and there's plenty of them here. Keep an eye out for Christopher Guest, who plays the first customer, Steve Martin, who plays a sadistic dentist, Bill Murray, who plays a masochistic dental patient, and John Candy, who plays a quirky radio DJ. Rick Moranis, who stars, is his usual goofy self, and he's actually a pretty good singer. I love the colour scheme of the film as well, which Frank Oz claims to be an imitation of technicolour. The sets are great as well, I love the look of the bricks andthe gritty but cartoony Skid Row. Then of course there's the puppet(s) of Audrey II, which are brilliant. If they remade this film today, and did the killer plant with computer animation, it wouldn't look half as good as the puppetry here, I'm sure. I love the way its mouth moves, I love the snake-like vines, the leaves and the tongue. It's all so great! <br /> <br />Special features on this DVD include a music only track, a couple of original 1980s TV spots and two original theatre trailers. There's also a reel of \\"outtakes and deleted scenes\\", and while it contains many a bizarre blooper, the only \\"deleted scenes\\" you will see in the reel are the ones for which there were outtakes (including two giant Audrey II's attacking a city and Rick Moranis running through a foggy nothingness with glowing columns for some reason). You also get an original 1987 documentary covering the making of the film, the origins of the musical and clips from the original 1960 film \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" starring Jack Nicholson, along with interviews from Frank Oz, Rick Moranis, David Geffen and Ellen Greene. To top the special features off, there's the audio commentary from Frank Oz (recorded in 1997) which is rather meticulous and rather technical, which I found fascinating. I'm sure aspiring filmmakers and puppeteers would get a lot out of it too. <br /> <br />Recommended to lovers of musicals, Rick Moranis, puppetry, B-grade horror films and of comedy. I love it!

B00005JOX6|1.0|This movie is absolutely terrible.  There are not even any words to describe this horrific insult to Adam Sandler's previously funny and successful career.  This film is an simply an insult to Sandler, and everyone involved, including the enormously talented cult favorite Christopher Walken.  The film begins in typical Sandler fashion, with slapstick after slapstick, but even then never REALLY picks up to the typical Sandler style we have grown accustomed to in the past.  Unfortunately, the movie really takes a turn for the worst about halfway through when the writers attempt to take the movie a complete 180 and incorporate it into a sappy drama.  Unfortunately for us, they do this THE WRONG WAY.  The Sandler we see halfway through Click is reminiscant of the lovably serious character we saw him as in Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love.  Unfortunately, I don't think Sandler plays that role well here at all, and the shoddy script just seems to cause the film to crumble apart.  There is no follow through, and the feel of the movie changes so quickly you don't have any clue what the hell is going on.  They take the film from the typical and constant goofball joker to a sappy, overdramatic and completely unnecessary drama that doesn't crack one joke for about 45 minutes...and they do this all in a matter of seconds.  It is so sudden and done so poorly that you are left wondering what the hell happened to the movie you were just watching.  The only thing Click does have is a great premise, which unfortunately just was not executed to it's fullest.  In the past it has been proven by Sandler that the comedic aspect of a film can still maintain itself wholly throughout in order to create a winning story with a moral.  Sandler has previously demonstrated to us the effectiveness of maintaining a level of humor throughout his films, even when attempting to execute a sappy, moral soaked finale as seen in The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, etc.  Sandler executed thoseroles superbly because he never lost his comedic edge throughout, and he was still able to prove that the underdog can win.  A film does not have to lose it's comedic edge to show a softer side, and Sandler has proven that many times before.  This film on the other hand takes that idea and does just the complete opposite.  If the movie was done correctly, it could have been a sure winner, but here we are forcefed an attrocity that is just 30 minutes too long.  All that Click is, is a Sandler film that simply ran out of jokes.  And even the standard slapstick in the first hour isn't anything to write home about.  I mean, is it acceptable to be able to say that David Hasselhoff is the films only redeeming savior?  If so, I won't even begin to go into the embarrassment this film is to Christopher Walken's legacy, or how many times Sandler has to make comments about how hot his own daughter is towards the end(I think he does that same disgusting line like 3 times is it?) I think it's time to hang it up, Adam.  It just aint funny anymore.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Considering what accomplished hacks director Chris Columbus and writer Steve Kloves are, it's amazing that the first entry in the Harry Potter film adaptation is as good as it is, despite shoddy special effects.  <br /> <br />In their debuts, Daniel Radcliffe is the affable, earnest Harry, Rupert Grint is the cynical Ron, and Emma Watson is the bookish Hermione. Sadly, this is the ONLY film in the series that made any kind of effort to portray Hermione and Ron as they were meant to be, while the sequels either butchered or overblew them.  <br /> <br />Old pros like the late Richard Harris and Maggie Smith add to the charm of this engaging fantasy.
0375507256|5.0|This is the second David Mitchell I've read (actually I listened to this one), and I thought it was outstanding.  His shtick is to write interconnected stories as part of one novel.  In this case the connections are through time, rather than space as in the case of \\"Ghostwritten.\\"  He is amazing at bringing time and place to life vividly.  Cloud Atlas also was very thought-provoking in that as the reader goes from one setting to the next, you miss the characters from the first, and are sad at their passing, but it's also inevitable.  Sorry, this isn't very coherent, but it's like being sad when reading of the passing of a historical character.
B00005JMAH|5.0|As I said in my review of the second film, the real problem with Chris Columbus was not that he tried to be faithful to the books, it was that he didn't have the talent to pull it off. So after enduring the crappy 2nd film (which managed to be worse than the book, which itself was not too good), the Potter film franchise is given a much needed shot in the arm thanks to hiring of a real director, Alfonso Cuaron, who, despite still being saddled with that idiot screenwriter Steve Kloves, succeeds where Columbus would have fallen flat on his face.  <br /> <br />Perhaps we shouldn't be surprise that the best of Rowling's books proved to be the best of the films.  <br /> <br />Which is not to say that the film is not without flaws. The films continue to pointlessly butcher Ron into a stupid, cry baby coward instead of portraying him as the loyal, funny, protective friend that he was in the books, and Rupert Grint's inability to act doesn't help. Exactly why the filmmakers feel they must ruin Ron, and why JK herself allows them to ruin Ron, is unclear. While the original book showed Ron defending Hermione from Snape and, in one of his all time greatest moments, stood up the an alleged killer declaring that he would have to be killed as well if it meant defending Harry, but the first moment is changed to Ron agreeing with Snape after Snape insulted Hermione - which makes no sense following previous events that would have him growing more protective of her, not less, and also screws with the so called romance brewing between them. And who gets to say \\"If you want to kill Harr you'll have to kill us too!\\"? Hermione! That's right, once again, Kloves screws Ron while blowing Hermione way out of proportion, apparently unaware that he is ruining the balance between the trio and making it impossible to believe that Ron and Hermione have romantic feelings for each other. The films never portray Hermione and Ron as having a bond that is developing beyond friendship, and despite socalled \\"extra hints\\" that \\"foreshadow\\" their love, Ron and Hermione merely come off as two stupid brats who want nothing to do with each other while lacking the romantic undercurrent that charged up the sparks between Hepburn & Tracy as well as Han Solo & Princess Leia. Do you think that Princess Leia would have fallen in love with Han Solo if Han constantly acted like a stupid, effeminate, inarticulate, weak willed coward who's scared of everything - including his own shadow? Hell no. Han wasn't always gallant, but he was never stupid nor cowardly; he also had the guts and the quick thinking, which in the end is what drew Leia to him. While he's not exactly Beowulf or Hercules, or even Aquaman, what is supposed to make Ron redeeming to Hermione is that he's clearly not as dumb as he occasionally appears to be and he's clearly a brave guy, otherwise, he wouldn't have landed in Gryffindor along with the rest of his family. Sadly, it appears that none of the filmmakers involved here, not even Alfonso Cuaron, easily the best of them, really understand that, and they apparently have no idea of how to portray the relationship between Ron and Hermione; they just expect the audience to go along with it figuring that most of them have read the books, so they put little to no effort into making it believable. They don't even try to include the moments that JK Rowling herself used to demonstrate the ever changing relationship with Hermione & Ron; in fact, they have the nerve to throw out those moments and come up with their own crap, but their crap only comes out as superficial and insincere. Meanwhile, Hermione, as played by Emma Watson, continues to move away from the bookworm we knew in the novel to a shallow, \\"so cool & charming she's girl power\\" twit. (Since when does Hermione cackle at Ron, fret over her hair, wear a pink hoodie with a rainbow belt, has the strength of Rocky Balboa that allows her to punch Draco down rather than just slap him, and show up looking dirtyblonde instead of frizzy brown?).  <br /> <br />Ron deserved better.  <br /> <br />Adding insult to injury, while it may not have been intentional on the part of the filmmakers, is that Hermione and Harry, who are presented as sharper and more focused, which is somewhat true even in the books, come across as having much more chemistry between the two of them than Hermione does with Ron, and at the end, they are even shown mocking him, once again throwing the balance of the trio out of whack because we don't see that Hermione also has a tendency to annoy Harry even though they're friends. Maybe Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe just have a natural chemistry with each other, but this also screws with the audiences because the film versions of Hermione & Harry seem to play so well off each other that it seems they are the ones destined to be together, as opposed to Hermione being with Ron (this will also make it even more difficult when trying to sell the audience on the concept of Harry's future romance with Ginny in \\"Half-Blood Prince\\"). When Hermione reaches out to a distraught Harry at Hogsmeade and flashes her big brown eyes to him, while Ron keeps his distance, you half expect Hermione to embrace Harry and give him a kiss. When Harry and Hermione are alone in the Forbidden Forest, you half expect Harry to rip Hermione's clothes off and make love to her (their lovemaking would probably be spoiled by the arrival of either the Lupin wolf or the Dementors). I know this probably wasn't intentional, but the filmmakers don't seem to understand that they're giving off the wrong impression to audiences.  <br /> <br />Despite these unfortunate changes, star Daniel Radcliffe finally begins to show us just how good an actor he's becoming - he's easily the best of the three, striking the right balance between his serious and light hearted moments without going over the top like his co-stars. Radcliffe works very well with both David Thewlis, in the role of Lupin, and Gary Oldman, in the role of Sirius Black. It's too bad that Radcliffe was not given more of a chance to interact with the new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, a fellow Irishman chosen to the replace the late Richard Harris, who's life & career sadly ended with the last clunker.  <br /> <br />Cuaron's stronger sense of pacing and visual narrative along with characterization also become apparent in his handling of the action pieces and atmospheric moments of fear. I sincerely hope that he returns to direct either the sixth or seventh installment.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I saw the show live back in '04, and it was fantastic... Film does not really do it justice, as it chops the musical numbers from their full lengths into 2 or 3 minute clips.  The film is very good, however.  It shows a new, more mature and spiritual side to Madonna, rather than the attention getter that we know and love from Truth or Dare.  The real jewel of this set however, is the live cd, which includes 14 songs from the show.  My favorite is Like A Prayer, which here is given a sort of unplugged, acoustic sounding arrangement.  And to the reviewer who said \\"Madonna does not play any instruments\\", she can be heard here playing guitar on Mother And Father, which was only one of several songs that she played on during the tour.  Bottom line, for any Madonna fan, this is a must have, and for anyone who's never seen her perform live, this is a great sampling of the overall Madonna Show Experience.
B00008DDXC|1.0|\\"Chamber\\" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience.  <br /> <br />Skip it if you can.
B00005JOX6|4.0|So, my wife and I decided to go to the movies yesterday. I wanted to see Nacho Libre and she wanted to see Click and so to be diplomatic about things, we tossed a coin. I guess I am going to have to see Nacho Libre another time...<br /><br />I'm not really big on Adam Sandler movies. I thoroughly enjoyed, the Waterboy, however, and even though I have yet to buy that movie on DVD, I watch it every time they show it on television.<br /><br />So, I'm sitting through this movie and the first thing I find hard to believe is that the Adam Sandler Character landed a babe like Kate Beckinsale. But of course, this movie is a \\"Fantasy\\" and so I guess anything is possible.<br /><br />Michael (the Adam Sandler character) meets Mort (played by the always delightfully weird, Christopher Walken)in the \\"Beyond\\" section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond and receives a universal remote free of charge because it is not yet on the market. Well, this universal remote not only controls Michael's television it also controls his universe.<br /><br />I can't exactly say when the movie actually \\"clicked\\" with me because at first, it just seemed kind of cheesy. Maybe it's because those scenes just primarly had Sandler in them. To me, Sandler needs a strong supporting cast because I really don't think he holds up on his own...but then again, do any of us...we all really need each other...<br /><br />The basic message of this film is that Life is a process; that things that we normally find tedious, and dull, and difficult to go through are all part of Life. We would all love to just \\"fast forward\\" to the good parts, but maybe every part of life - including the dull and tedious parts - are good. Be sure to bring some Kleenex because even though I didn't \\"bawl\\" I did tear up a bit which is crazy in the first place...I mean, it's an Adam Sandler movie...who knew?<br /><br />I was having a discussion with my friend who had also seen the movie and he felt that I was \\"reading\\" too deeply into things and maybe it was just a movie. Maybe it didn't have any other meaning other than to simply \\"entertain\\". Okay, I'll buy that. For the average movie goer who just wants to be entertained, it is definetely entertaining, but if you are like me and want to be entertained as well as reminded of certain basic truths about life than this movie will definetely remind you of those truths that we often forget ( or misplace) during our own process called life.<br /><br />Besides, after all is said and done, Kate Beckinsale is in this movie for godssakes so you have to see it!!!<br /><br />Have a great life, people...ngs and maybe it was just a movie. Maybe it didn't have any other meaning other than to simply \\"entertain\\". Okay, I'll buy that.

There are many catchy tunes and also a lot of heavy stuff on \\"mars\\". The reason i dont think it is as good as some of their past albums is because many of the songs are slow, some of them good (especially \\"snow\\"), but after a while it gets kind of annoying. Of course, you can always skip tracks, and since there are 28 songs, you can skip a fair amount and still listen to at least an album's worth of songs.
B000058983|5.0|A young Jim Morrison once wanted to be more popular than the group of Love. Well, Morrison got his wish. The Doors eventually became more popular than the group Love, but this does not anyway, underestimate the Power of Love.<br /><br />This is such a great recording. It's dripping in psychedelia. It's dripping with that 60s sentiment that Love really could change things. Of course, nowadays most people don't believe that it can, that's why it's often overlooked, but to those who secretly hold onto that belief...like me...we know that it will be Love and only Love that will change our lives and eventually, our world.<br /><br />This is a very important collection of music and belongs on every audiophile's shelf. It's important not because it is a reflection of that time that once existed so long ago, but a time that could exist again if we let ourselves become hopeful, idealistic, and innocent enough to believe that \\"when the power of Love overcomes the Love of Power, the world will change\\"... a quote by the late, great Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Yeah, you could say the music is dated and old and not too relevant or you could say, \\"Wow...this is refreshing...this is original...this is what raw creativity is supposed to sound like.\\"<br /><br />I love to listen to this recording when I'm feeling particularly groovy and I want to once again reclaim the truth that Love makes all things possible.<br /><br />Discover the possibilities of Love.
B000F48CD8|5.0|At first, although i liked half the songs, i really wasn't as into it as i was the white stripes, but now the cd and the racanteurs have grown on me and are already one of my favorite bands. The first five songs are clearly better than the last 5, but all of the songs are pretty good. Steady as she goes is a masterpiece and is as you may know so far the only single and therefore the only song on the radio, but i cant help but feel that there is at least one more single to come from this great debut cd.

B00005JP0A|5.0|For the person who has suffered working for a boss from hell, he or she can relate to Andy, a recent college graduate who takes a job with the world's most famous fashion magazine, Runway, to get a year of experience under her belt.  Unknowningly, the doe-eyed, fashion-challenged young lady walks into the lair of the devil, Miranda Priestly.  Taking a job in a field she knows nothing about certainly does nothing to impress the vicious and EXTREMELY demanding Miranda, who chews her assistants up and spits them out on a regular basis.<br /><br />From the start, Andy is fighting an uphill battle.  Slowly, however, with the help of Nigel, one of Miranda's right hand men, who has not lost his soul while working for his evil boss, she decides to change and throw all her effort into pleasing Miranda.  Aided by Nigel, Andy slowly emerges as a fashionable, young assistant proving that she is capable of handling any of Miranda's insane and nearly impossible demands.  However, she soons begins to realize that her job is consuming her life and destroying her relationship with friends and her boyfriend, Nate.  The question that she eventually faces, is how far will she will go with her demanding job---to the top or abandon the normal life she enjoyed with her loved ones.<br /><br />I read this book and enjoyed it and was delighted to hear that Meryl Streep would play Miranda.  And while the book is told through Andy's eyes, Miranda is the person you can't look away from and this is the deliciously evil kind of role that any actress would enjoy playing.  It is no surprise that Meryl tackles it with amazing ease and oozes an aura of iciness that would freeze you in your spot.  Without raising her voice, she simply slices you down with a pointed sentence that cuts deeper than daggers or simply gives a look of disgust that makes you want to throw up your lunch---in these girls' cases, that would be a miracle since they eat almost nothing.  At any rate, I would love to see Meryl get a nomination for this role because she simply MAKES the movie.<br /><br />Anne Hathway is a great choice for Andy and your heart certainly goes out to her.  Whether she is trying to get Miranda's hot coffee or trying to get her hands on the manuscript for the latest Harry Potter novel, you feel the dread along with the character as she brings her tasks to the disapproving eyes of Ms. Priestly.  Stanley Tucci also does a great job as Nigel, who takes her under his wing and gives her the chops to make it in the halls of Runway.<br /><br />For those who read the book, you will not be disappointed.  And for anyone who is a fan of Meryl Streep, this is a movie you will want to see (and later own on dvd).  For those who love fashion, of course, this will be right down your alley!  But for all of us who know how bad a mean boss can be, you will sympathize!

0440238609|5.0|If you are looking for intelligent, thought-provoking and fine prose, look no further.  This is what Narnia and Harry Potter aspire to.  Philip Pullman has managed to bring together the alternate anglophilic world of Harry Potter without the treacle and combine it with the metaphysical questioning of Narnia (without the didactic religiousity) to come up with a startling and satisfying read.  <br /> <br />Particularly moving and effective is the characterization of Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon.  Also finely drawn are Lyra's relationships with various people and animals...her fierce personality makes me wish that I had been this type of young girl - brave, loyal, and determined.  All of this without being sappy or obvious.   <br /> <br />I have to say that as an adult I find this trilogy inspiring in its daring and depth...what other set of novels dares to take on the question of life after death, the state of the soul, religion, parental relationships, and soul mates? <br /> <br />I can't say enough to recommend this trilogy without gushing anymore.

From the flying through space opening credits to the new twist at the end (no spoilers) I was completely surprised and delighted. Everyone was very well casted and played there part so well even well known actress like Kevin Spacey you felt was Lex Luther.  Brandon Routh was the perfect choice and became the perfect Big screen Superman, He owns it as well as Christopher Reeves did (the only person otter the Reeves that could play such a role. But the big surprise was Kate Bosworth. She redefines the role as Lois Lane, after her ownership of the role, I can now not imagine any other actress ever playing that role. My hat of to her, she was the best surprise of this Great Summer movie. A must go out to the Theater and see, Movie!!!
0060734191|4.0|This trilogy is satisfying and surprising in the strength of its female characters while never losing sight of a good story.  Fantasy at its finest...you get parallel worlds, magic, mundanity, and misunderstanding, but not to comic effect, rather to catastrophic endings.   <br /> <br />What is really lovely about reading this series, other than the fine prose, is the ambivalence that each character encounters and doesn't quite overcome...in other words, it is a fine telling of the difficulties that we all have in the negotiation of adolescence to adulthood.

B000063JZQ|4.0|No true middle ground exists for this Roman Polanski-directed 1971 filming of Shakespeare's MACBETH; people either love it or they hate it.  Such often happens with provocative movies like this, whether it's Shakespeare or something else entirely.    But in bringing this most hard-edged of the Bard's plays to the screen, courtesy of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Enterprises and noted British critic and playwright Kenneth Tynan, Polanski not only stayed faithful to the play's dark, gothic, and tragic tale of betrayal and murder, he took many elements of the story that usually are done offstage and put them onscreen.  It is those elements that a lot of the derisiveness towards his telling of MACBETH is directed at.  This is clearly not a repeat of Orson Welles' 1948 version, nor Kurosawa's THEATRE OF BLOOD, by any stretch of the imagination.    Working with an all-British cast, notably Jon Finch (later to achieve notice as the beleagured innocent man of Hitchcock's FRENZY) as Macbeth, and Francesca Amis as Lady Macbeth, Polanski drips his version of the play largely in blacks and grays, with plenty of supernatural imagery--so much so that this could easily be classified as a horror film.  That incredible feel is enhanced by the first-rate cinematography of Gilbert Taylor, who worked with Polanski on his 1965 horror opus REPULSION, and with Stanley Kubrick in 1964 on DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.    There is no denying it, however.  Even now, thirty-five years since its release in late 1971, MACBETH remains an incredibly violent and graphic piece, very much in keeping with the Bard's intentions, and that violence, which includes several instances of severed body parts and much blood, placed it alongside two other notable 1971 films (Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS; Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) as a touchstone for the impact that graphic cinematic violence could have on the world at large.  And quite a good bit has been said about how much impact the horrific 1969 murder of Polanski's wife Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson clan had on the director's storytelling.    Much of the latter, however, remains in the end a sidebar to this lengthy but compelling dark story.  In the end, like Zefirrelli's superb 1968 filming of ROMEO AND JULIET, this version of MACBETH stands out as perhaps the best example of cinematic Shakespeare sans either Welles or Olivier, and still remains intriguing.  But be advised because, again, this is definitely NOT a film for the younger set, or people with a low tolerance for extreme violence.
B000002INR|5.0|This is the true and defining moment for the 80s and is an apropos summary for the decade. This album came out in 1989, after Motley Crue, Ratt, White Lion, Journey, and all the others had made their mark. The truth is this album tried to save the genre of album oriented rock (find a bad song on it and you'll have a thousand people telling you that you're crazy), tried to save glam metal (although they weren't exactly trying to get on the cover of a rock magazine every other week like Motley Crue) by having a look that matched the sound. This is good rock. You would be hard pressed to find another album from 1989 that influenced as many, sold as many, or was played as much (on the radio, home stereos, car stereos, etc) than this.
0156027321|5.0|Hard thing to read something that can actually change your life dramatically.  <br />This book does. <br />The way you thought things are, well, thing of the past until your read this story that puts your mind to work in such an extent that it confronts you with the \\"inevitable\\", not an easy task.     Hard thing for a book to remain in your mind for a long, long period of time, it's a time to question the impact it made, to analize it and to simply wonder about the universality of values.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Even a very weird love story such as this one is beautiful. Have you noticed how all stories of love are about fighting to overcome something in order to come together? Here the two lovers are fighting to retain such a basic good: their own memories. Disillusioned, as lovers often are, they had tried to blot out all memories and thoughts about each other and find out that the good ones are far more valuable than the bad ones. Here the love story is a fight for self-transcendence. As all love story ultimately is.  <br /> <br />But there is something more. When he, desperate to hold on to her, thinks of her she is actively there giving him ideas and pushing him on. So is she really there or not? What reality consists of is maybe the most fundamental question there is, and I think this movie as well as the great movie \\"Solaris\\" by Andrei Tarkovsky make you think about this. <br />
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Arrived quickly. Funny movie not the ordinary main stream stuff. Was bought as a gift.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the type of show that would probably be considered as a classic in twenty years. The plots are amazing. To new fans of Gilmore Girls, you first meet Rory and her mother in a diner. Unlike most shows, the pilot gets your attention quick. That's what i like about each gilmor girl episode.  <br /> <br />It's funny to see how many agruments Rory's mother and Emily Gilmore can think of. I really think that in the later seasons, they should have stuck with Dean. The first boy who enters into Rory's life. All of the town folk are hilarious and likes to be nosy with eachother. This is the best season of the show
0783226845|2.0|This movie is for you if you want to waste your time watching two people talking for over two hours.  I can't even begin to explain how boring this movie is.
B000FILW86|5.0|These guys do not sound there age on this one! I do not know if this is as good as the late 70's or mid 80's, and I don't care this CD is excellent! When one compares the newest to the oldest, one has that reminiscent thing in the way. So this one has great production, vocals, instrumentation, song writing, yada, yada, and yada.....Hey this one ROCKS!!!! Personaly it sounds like the Beatles meets 80's hair bands, if you like power pop it is a must! One critic said,\\" they punch up the ballads and sweeten the rockers\\",the whole CD flows together nicely. If you like melody with strong guitars, and vocals (strong bass,and drums too, sorry Tom and Bun E.)Then Blow out your speakers now! I have an addiction, and it is called \\"ROCKFORD\\"!!!!!!!
6305558167|5.0|Excalibur usually creates one of two reactions in veiwers. Either they loved it or they hated it. To be honest this is really Merlin's movie. He's the dominant personality and is the most interesting. King Arthur reacts to events rather than making  them himself, the actress playing Guinivere was downright homely and the scene where Lancelot runs naked made me laugh but the mood of the film, the way everything is shown in shadow or in an eerie overbrightness, the glorious Wagner music, the since of destiny and doom and the serious performances of each actor make this the best King Arthur movie ever made.  <br /> <br />Plus, the scene where Arthur finally rouses himself from a Theoden like stupor and rides out with his knights for one last time while the land suddenly bursts into fruifulness is amazing. I love this movie and whenever it comes on TV I'm there.
B00004RF9B|3.0|The best thing about Forbidden Planet is the concept of the power of Freud's 'Id'. Otherwise, without the base on earth from the 1950s, such as in This Island Earth, War of the Worlds, It Came from Outer Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still & maybe The 27th Day, it lacks the charm of comparison with the era then, thus has to be compared with the 'total space' movies of the latter part of the century, like the original Star Wars - still the top of the genre, Alien & Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan. The best films of aliens or futuristic creations combined with earth settings, like Blade Runner, Solaris, Terminators 1&2, Starman, Dark City, or even the inner space of Tron from more contemporary times have a far more sophisticated resonance for repeated viewings. In sum, after seeing it again after many years, I found Forbidden Planet fairly boring & simply not very well done overall.
B000FGGE68|4.0|I watched Ultraviolet in the movie theatre, and was totally jarred by gaps in the plot. Certain elements of the movie made no sense; Violet would be in a building, cornered, and then scene would cut to the next, and somehow she was out. Futhermore, the whole plot about the virus seemed absurb; there was so little context about the virus that it was silly that the movie expected the audience to understand what was going on. Something didn't seem right. So I was very curious to see what the extended version of the movie was like, particularly since I had heard that the studio did a lot of cutting for the theatre version. <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine that a few extra minutes in the \\"extended cut\\" can make much of a difference, but after watching this version of the DVD, the movie was much more enjoyable. Scenes were put into context, action scenes were extended, and a little more background went a long way. This version was superior in many ways than the theatre version. <br /> <br />The sound appears to still be lacking, however, with a lack of speech syncing or medicore background sounds at certain times. <br /> <br />Much of the movie is eye candy, with wonderful, artistic graphics that highlight this action movie's fast pace.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|\\"It's not out and you feel you can review it ?\\" Interesting comment from some reviewers who then rated the DVD with 1 star or so. It is contradictory, isn't it?  <br /> <br />Of all the negative comments on this DVD, there is one thing that is in common. That they are all from die-hard Roger Waters fan. Pity that they let their emotions towards RW blind their judgement on any music from David Gilmour. <br /> <br />I discovered Pink Floyd at a very late stage. My first PF record was \\"The Division Bell\\" and I loved it so much that I went on to buy all the PF records. These days DB is still the one I love most. Pulse was the DB concert tour and it had a great mix of songs. The concert was awesome and I particular like the way DG smiled and exchanged glances with the band during the show. They enjoyed the music and the performance as they played the songs together. They certainly had a lot of fun and that was what it should be.  <br /> <br />I have the VCDs for some time now and I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. To all who like Roger Waters and hate David Gilmour, I would say give this DVD a chance. Watch the wonderful movie that Amazon provides and then honestly ask yourself if it isn't really good.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|All who loved the original 1978 Superman Soundtrack should defintley buy this! John Ottman delivers a powerful moving emotional score for Superman Returns.  He pays homage to John Williams's theme while still making it something of his own.  I HIGHLY recommend this score!! You will not be disappointed.  Twenty seconds into the Main Titles, and you will know what I'm talking about.  Defintley a must have in your collection!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I finally got to view the movie that made the term \\"Vote For <br />Pedro\\" a popular fashion item. This movie portrays the life of a poor nerdy child and his horrible social life.He is always getting abused by the \\"popular\\" crowd at school.He isabused in one form or the other by being slammed into the lockers or other indignities.He has a prom date that leaves him at the prom by himself.His brother has a lady love that he has met over the internet.When she arrives on the bus in his hometown is <br />one of the funnier scenes.His uncle Rico is a card carrying conman who has many outlandish schemes that he is always launching.His little girlfriend also adds to the quality of the <br />movie.The most outlandish part of the movie is his friend Pedro's run for the Class President.Our star does a dance taught to him by his brother's girlfriend to save Pedro's run <br />for office.Now in every mall in America you see \\"Vote For Pedro\\" <br />clothing wear.A very entertaining movie that I enjoyed watching. <br />I was also happy to know what \\"Vote For Pedro\\" meant.
B00005YU1O|5.0|An example of anime being superior to live-action. Check out the source live-action film examples on the dvd extras. An interesting excursion into thought processes and life suppositions, which even if not true are conceptually mesmorising. Uniquely executed. Linklater's best & most continually interesting film. This is one of the 4 animes in my permanent top 550 film collection, the others are: Watership Down, one of my top 50+ & the best cartoon movie ever made bacause of the story, underlying spiritual content & lovely painted panels; Ghost in the Shell, for innovation, style & content; The Incredibles, because it's a lot of fun with repeated viewings.
0767802519|5.0|great movie, but the editorial reviewer of all people made a significant mistake, they wrote leon is a french hitman, no he is italian, tony is too, they even met at an italian restaraunt to discuss business, even gary oldman said \\"the same italian hitman i'm dying to meet him\\" he is an italian hitman, not french!!!!!!

B00000J6AG|5.0|I purchased this CD a couple of years ago on a whim, after having read the reviews and being bombarded with his name during some election periods.  While I don't agree with his political stance and methodologies, I don't let that affect my likes/dislikes in music.    I must say that this CD blew me away; it was so different than many things I have heard before but yet the tunes were catchy and somewhat addictive.  One of the songs is very repetitous and yet, it's one of my favorites.  Several other reviewers gave very detailed reviews of each song, and I'm not going to repeat their efforts here.     All in all, I just wanted to say if you have never given Moby a listen, you ought to do yourself a favor and pick up this CD.  I think you will find that you won't be disappointed.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Superman tries too hard to overemphasise on a small storyline.Superman,being away, from his loved ones is gonna cause a world of an impact. The movie lacks good direction, is full of cheesy goof ups and tries to rake in a lot of thunderous applause for it's action scenes but fails in doing so. The last half an hour was quite boring and the first forty five mins made me wish I had downloaded this film and given it a watch. That way I would've only cursed my download and not the money I had spent on watching this film.<br /><br />Superman makes me realise how I didnt miss much by missing out on films like Batman Begins. I've heard they were similar. Well, I'm twenty two and I like films with superheroes(or I can stand to watch them) but Superman Returns is a failure, a miserable failure.<br /><br />Three other reasons for my disliking of the film, a) Not enough scenes with Kevin Spacey, b) the child and the mother, none of whom can act; c) just how overdramatic it's limited storyline seems to be.<br /><br />You can hate me for saying this but this movie sucks. It's possibly the worst of it's kind. I'd much rather give animation movies like Cars a shot.<br /><br />p.s - there is not one scene in this film that will make you go \\"WHOA\\" [*sigh* what a let down]
1594200823|5.0|I do not exaggerate. This is a significant book. In very accessible prose, it summarizes the food industry of the US and what we are exporting abroad. <br /> <br />I find it very informative. After reading the first 100 pages, I found myself shocked when I went to the grocery store and realized the truth behind most of the products therein. <br /> <br />I think it your duty to your own well being and that of your family as well as to the future well being of the country to read this book!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's utterly awesome. The one thing you have to remember... no physics are visibly apparrent.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Since this movie is known most for the controversy, I am going to start and finish with it to reflect people's habit of starting and ending their impressions of something with a scene out of context. It wasn't porn, and my argument for that comes completely from the context... what happens directly before and after that moment. Basically, people have been angry at Gallo for being self-involved in this movie, especially that scene, but during that scene the self-involvement is literally the point. It's masturbatory, but the key is that it drains him, just like masturbation. One thing the DVD box says about it is that it's one of the \\"frankest portrayals of male sexuality on film\\" and so let's be frank here.<br /><br />His sexual confusion is part of his grief, and part of grief is the habit of trying to deny it actually happened. So when he starts acting dominant during that scene with what's happening, it's his subconscious trying to throw a sort of male sexual dominance over something he doesn't understand and hasn't allowed himself to accept. But when it drains him, he's forced to admit that he doesn't only grieve for her but hates her for forcing him into that grief, and from there comes probably one of the best conversations (or inner dialog) I've seen in film in a long time.<br /><br />But does it necessarily need to be \\"shown\\" rather than implied?<br /><br />Well yes. Because the character's focus is so involved on it, it literally is all his mind is allowing him to care about in that moment. Basic rule of a close-up: if the camera focuses on something like that, then the director is trying to point something out. If it's porn, it's meant to arouse... but this scene isn't arousing, especially because of its context.<br /><br />But enough of that, because I want to discuss something else about this movie. Partly because of the controversy around this movie, and partly because of the publicity, I had the initial impression that Gallo was an abrasive and over-masculinized character in this film. Wow, complete opposite... I totally related to his character. Of course, his short relationships with those women don't seem to work at first, but once we get an idea of where he's coming from in his grief (and men's general dislike of expressing it or asking for help), the relationships make perfect sense in terms of being representational (thus the obvious motif of all of their flower names and his name as \\"Bud\\"). Basically, the first woman fits what he's looking for courteously, the second emotionally, and the third emotionally, but none of them match the full attraction he has to the only woman he's ever loved. I liked it.<br /><br />And the long continuing imagery of the road trip was really neat too, as it actually really captured that introspective feeling of it. Most roadtrip movies show the car in moments of time from the exterior... which kind of changes the perspective of what a roadtrip is. This movie shows it literally from the passenger seat, complete with the dirty/smudged window and the long road stretched ahead. I think there was only one shot that was actually an exterior of the van when on the freeway, the rest of the exteriors were when the van was parking or he was stopped somewhere. I find it very lovely, ultimately, and as my mother once said, \\"The road trip is something of a rite of passage amongst American males. It's a moment when they take on as much of the world as they feel necessary all on their own.\\" Gallo seems to have the same idea, though there is a major American film genre built around that idea as well: the road as a literal transfiguration of self-discovery.<br /><br />So, going back to the controversy, it really disappoints me that this film has to be known for that when there is so much more art and beauty and innocence it has to offer. I also find the controversy rather inconsistant, considering most people have absolutely no trouble with the female body in various states of arousal, yet as soon as \\"the male gender\\" is shown, it's pornographic! The funny thing is, it contributes to that very male sense of fear and dominance they feel they must assert sexually. So I guess I could make an argument that Gallo did that scene to attack that inconsistant form of sexual censorship, but if I didn't already know that basically Sevigny and he agreed to do it because, \\"Why not, we were in a relationship, we did it before, might as well just show it!\\"<br /><br />--PolarisDiBal, yet as soon as \\"the male gender\\" is shown, it's pornographic!

B000CNFC76|4.0|Watching a movie about a kid's struggle to play golf I'd assumed would be about as appealing as sticking hot needles in my eyes. But I'd heard a few good things about THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED and found out that it was directed by Bill Paxton (ALIENS, 1986) so decided to give it a go. I ordered it from my online rental company and, to my additional horror once it arrived, discovered that it was a Disney film. Oh Lord, nooo! Not having anything else to watch, I swallowed my Mouseketeer bile and slid it into my DVD player.<br /><br />Well, it ain't too bad. Shia Le Beouf stars as 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, the historically amazing young man who had a knack for the game of golf and beat out two \\"veteran\\" British players (Harry Vardon and Ted Ray)  for the U.S. Open, and did so using a preteen caddy with a loud personality but a love of the game.<br /><br />There have been a lot of films made featuring golf at their cores and I've seen many of them. TIN CUP was probably my favorite. HAPPY GILMORE was funny but in a gruff, teenage sort of way. CADDYSHACK: `nough said. THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE was modestly entertaining. And now we have THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED. Being \\"Disneyfied\\" the film takes this historical golfing event and puts a gushing feel-good face on it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; just something you might want to brace yourself for. Francis is at odds with his father, who believes that golf is a waste of time and is outside their class. Francis and his family aren't wealthy and struggle to get by. So the tensions get moved up a few notches as Francis and his father find themselves in the middle of a generation gap. There's a love interest in a woman who's waaaay beyond Francis' means. And there's the growing attraction of the down-and-out toward Francis as they read about his success in the papers during the pre-depression times.<br /><br />The acting was okay. Nothing outstanding with the exception of Francis' little caddy, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) who steals almost every scene he's in.<br /><br />What made this film a success was how it was filmed. Cameras perched on top of golf balls as they're hit. Special effects that make the crowds vanish and leave the golfer all alone on the fairway with nothing between him and the green. The slow-motion swings of these men and how clean they were. That's what really helped move this flick along and didn't linger on putts, bad lays, or other golfing intricacies that easily could put many watchers to sleep.<br /><br />If you're a Disney fan you'll probably fall on your knees and give praise to such a high quality film. And even if you're not a big bolster of the Mouse Man, you might find this to be a relative gem amongst their more overly-sweet works.ery (Josh Flitter, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) who steals almost every scene he's in. <br /> <br />What made this film a success was how it was filmed.

0060926317|1.0|While reading this book, I underwent several stages of repulsion:  disbelief that such an inarticulate writer could be published; disgust at the author's unwavering egotism; skepticism of the book's illusory events; and finally outrage at the fact the Marlo Morgan degraded an entire culture to benefit herself.  Having read this book, I am now more stupid because of it.  I am well aware this book is a complete work of fraud, but nonetheless it has planted a grossly distorted view of Aboriginal culture in my mind.  My real concern is for the readers who actually believe this book is true.
B00005MP58|5.0|After checking this movie at least over twenty times from the library to watch I decided to buy my own disk.  <br />It is truly a great movie for those who love a romantic story where the characters have a love plight of their own. <br />I find this original version better than the new Pride and Prejudice as the story is more in depth.  <br />You won't be dissappointed!!! <br />
B000000HHE|5.0|Not only was this De La Soul's debut, it's also a landmark, classic album....De La carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 Feet High and Rising....They presented an almost alternative form of hip hop...One where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are....As a result, they were unfairly labled \\"hippie's\\".... <br /> <br />The music on here is top notch...Prince Paul, the groups main producer for their first 3 albums, delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much, much more relaxed....They do an amazing job of sampling Steely Dan on \\"Eye Know\\"....Some of my other favorites include 'Potholes in my lawn, Me,myself and I, and the funky collab w/ the Native Tongue Crew (A Tribe Called Quest (actually just Q-Tip) , and the Jungle Brothers) \\"Buddy\\".... <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album for anyone....
B000J10ERO|5.0|At long last it's here.  After a decade of studio development through flightless incarnations, Superman wrasslin' polar bears, and a black suit, the Last Son of Krypton has finally made it into theaters. Of course, nothing could have stopped The Man of Steel. I'm sure that after this long of a wait most people expect nothing less than the second coming from Superman Returns. With all of the Christ imagery in the new film, it seems that the filmmakers were more than happy to oblige. <br /> <br />However, while there are more than a few allusions to Christ in Superman Returns, I believe the film is actually dealing with the broader theme of Joseph Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. Much of Campbell's book deals with what he calls the \\"monomyth,\\" which is a single mythic structure that can be juxtaposed on just about any myth from any culture. This monomyth is supposed to be hardwired into us through Jungian psychology.  <br /> <br />Campbell then goes on to analyze the themes found in the monomyth. One of the reoccurring themes of the monomyth is the return home. A hero must venture into an outer mystical world (ex: Luke Skywalker leaving Tatooine and Frodo leaving The Shire) on some kind of journey. However, eventually the hero will return to his home with the skills he has learned abroad and give his homeland a \\"boon\\" (ex: Luke Skywalker returning to Tatooine and destroying Jabba the Hut and Frodo and his friends saving The Shire during the Battle of Bywater [not shown in the movie]). This boon is supposed to reinvigorate the once decaying society. <br /> <br />Predictably, Superman Returns deals heavily with the idea of Campbell's return. One of the revelations of A Hero with a Thousand Faces is that although the mythic hero is spoken of in terms of the ideal man, the mythic hero is really just a representation of each person's true potential. The hero is really just a stand in for all of us at our greatest. This is what Superman Returns understands. There'sa great bit of dialogue from Marlon Brando where he says something to the affect: \\"They can be a great people Jor-El. They wish to be. They only need someone to show them the way.\\" (Warning: superspoilers below). Furthermore, Superman is not the only hero in this film. Lois Lane's fiancé, Richard White, rushes to the aid of his love interest and their son (?).  (On a side note, it's nice to have a film that makes the other guy a decent human being. It seems like every film makes the \\"other guy\\" out to be some jerk. This puzzles me, because who has sympathy for a girl who's going to marry a jerk?) Superman himself needs heroes to come to his own rescue. They come in the form of Lois herself and, later, the police officers and doctors who bring him to the hospital and help him recover. The hospital part in the movie is genius because it expands the idea of a hero beyond the guy in tights to every one of us. The \\"boon\\" in Superman Returns ends up being an example that's not beyond the stars, but firmly within our reach. <br /> <br />There are other themes in the film that bear discussion (the new family dynamics for example). There are also little ways I could nitpick the film (the Christ imagery is a little heavy handed, and weren't Siegel and Shuster Jewish anyways?), but that's not a whole lot of fun. While not perfect, Superman Returns delivers some great action, drama, and a pinch of intellectual ideas, but, most importantly, it also leaves the viewer anticipating a sequel. My vote for the next title: Superman Again: Lois Lane's Quest for Child Support. Picture Brandon Routh out on his dilapidated porch sporting a wife beater with a beer in his hand, and Lois Lane with their kid resting on her hip yelling at that deadbeat.  Now that's a movie America can get behind.
B00005JOQS|3.0|The latest installment of the Supeman franchise, \\"Superman Returns\\" is nothing more than a re-imagining of the original 1978 film.  Let's look:<br /><br />He rockets back from Krypton, to be discovered in a field by his mother.  Returns to the Daily Planet (okay, that's a given), but his first big rescue is saving Lois Lane from a crashing jet plane (helicopter), which incidentally was plucked right out of an old Max Fleisher cartoon.  Another nod to former Supermen was his rescue of Lex Luthor's henchgirl, Kitty (a Miss Teskmacher replacement)which mirrors exactly the cover of Action Comics #1.  But I digress.  The big catastrophe involves Luthor's lust for land - again, and Superman saves the day by doing an impossible feat, just before Miss Teskmacher - I mean Kitty - foils Luthor's fiendish plot.<br /><br />Bryan Singer, who did a stellar job on his two \\"X-Men\\" movies, and who knows WAY too much Superman lore, added in the new wave junk about the tension between Lois and Superman, and a few other \\"Alan Alda-ish\\" touches, just enough for me to catagorize the movie as a chick-flick date film, although Christopher Reeve made a more convincing Clark Kent.<br /><br />All in all, an okay effort with passable special effects (that's right - I said passable - I watched the original movie right after I saw the I new one, and the flying effects DO NOT look antiquated!).  I just have one major glaring faux pax - aside from butchering Supeman mythology - to gripe about.  The costume designer for the film made over 80 Superman costumes and a few dozen capes at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars; yet the yellow \\"S\\" on the back of the cape is noticeably missing!
B000FI904E|5.0|This cd is one of the best Nightwish has ever maid. And I know that because I have them all. The first time I heard this band was a time at my firnds house and she playd \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" on her stero and I think I fell in some kind of trance I just heard the music comming from the streo and nothing more. The only thing I could say was \\"What's that?\\". And after that I have bought cd's and dvd's. But back to the album. The cd like I sad before is the best of Nightwish beacuse it has all and then I meen ALL the best songs from the other albums all my favorites. And sinse it's a live album it's not to dificullt to sing along with Tarja on songs like \\"Sleeping Sun and \\" Over The Hills and far Away\\". So this is defenattly a must have for all Nightwish fans around the world. But If you've never heard songs drom Nightwish I would start with \\"High Hopes: The Best Of Nightwish\\".  But like I sad this is the best album out there from this fantastic band! ^^ <br />:D <br />:P <br />:) <br />;D <br />;P <br />;)
0812550706|4.0|Good Book, great characters, and i loved the way he explained the story. The only downside is the ending. The ending ends very abruptly and i didnt like the story at the end because of reasons that might ruin the story for some of you buying. Good Book overall.Highly Recommended for teens especially. 4.5 stars and a must read.
B000089RVX|1.0|I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think evanasance is a wannabe. I think she needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to staple picture of my face on lots of things. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I guess there's a guilty pleasure wrapped up here somewhere in ULTRAVIOLET, a bloated video-gamer's paradise of a movie with action sequences quite possibly choreographed by Maybelline in order to provide the most subtle, haunting, and pristine glances at the features of Milla Jovovich.  All kidding aside, she is quite stunning to look at.<br /><br />The plot -- not that one matters! -- is inconsequential here.  All the film is shuttles between excuses to get from each action set piece to the next compliments of plenty of obvious CGI.  Don't get me wrong!  When it's action, it's quite pretty ... arguably as pretty as is the film's lead.  It's Milla fighting, Milla shooting, Milla on a motorcycle, Milla swinging a samurai sword ... so many bodies, so little time (7 minutes longer than the theatrical cut for those of you keeping track).<br /><br />In a film where the science is largely unexplained and sacrificed to the world of magic (Violet has a mystical belt buckle that not only allows her to ignore the law of gravity but also anything she's riding, too!), what matters is that it all look pretty, and, on that level, I guess it's safe to conclude that the package is delivered.  While she's young and in shape, Ms. Jovovich can make flicks like this around the clock, and she'll always have SOME audience ... once the movie ends, they'll all head back home to their XBoxes.<br /><br />I will say this: there's no doubt in my mind that whatever ULTRAVIOLET is based on -- a graphic novel, a video game, or something less three-dimensional -- it's probably quite better than this stinker of a story.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Perfect beggining for the end of Barrett, and his personality demise, even though he is in a couple tracks, give a lot of credit to Waters for stepping up to the plate as far as songwritting goes, even the keyboardist Rick Wright also includes a couple. This is the album that introduces David Gilmore, which ironically knew Syd from the Cambridge school years, yep he took over the guitar work on this album. This album is full of colorful sounds throughout, very much into the space rock with Let there be Light, and even Set the controls for the Heart of The Sun. A child like glance with Rick's Remember the Day, its been quoted he didn't like his songwritting, but at least he put some effort into it. You got your sarcastic Corporal Clegg which is ironic that this would also be put in place in the future with The Final Cut, in which Waters coming to terms with his lost of his dad in the 2nd world war, lots of emotions there. A Saucerful of Secrets would make a great departure song at a funeral home, it's eerie and beautiful all together, it's a song which expresses life and death all in 11 minutes, and the music kind of runs thru that path too. Then you got another on by Wright with See Saw, another childlike flashback. And then the finale state of mind of Syd's Jugband Blues, it's sad how he departured like this but it's a constant reminder of what drugs (especially LSD) can do to you, not a good choice, which is why the Floyd stayed out of the evils of harmful drugs since this time, well maybe they still toked a little, well anyways, try a listen it's worth it, and if you like this album try their first album Piper at the Gates of Dawn too, they're both trippy together.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Ive never been a fan of A7X, but this album caught my attention for a couple of reasons: <br /> <br />1. The amazing guitar work demonstrated by Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance. What these two guys can do on the strings is amazing. They deserve to be in a true Heavy Metal band. Their talent is somewhat...confined here. <br /> <br />2. At least they TRIED to go back to the roots of old school Metal like Priest, Maiden, and Sabbath. Kudos for that. In the end, though, they ended up sounding more like Guns 'N Roses. <br /> <br />What it comes down to is this: this album has some good tracks on it, but it fails to keep you interested for the full length of it.
B000002J29|5.0|Wow....I mean, what else can one really say after listening to something like this? This was my introduction to Genesis, and ever since this has been one of my favorite live albums ever!! It's amazing, and anyone who's a fan of the band will love this piece of work.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Possibly one of the greatest thrash metal albums of all time. Its amazing to me that bands can basically do the same thing that was done 20 years ago and make it better than ever. Bands like Kreator can keep doing this stuff because they are the originators. This record is a masterpiece. The rhythm guitars are amazing. The drums sound so good its unbelievable. This is a fast, heavy, and well produced album. If you want to listen to the band that is the flavor of the month, then this isnt your album. But if you want to hear some of the most brutal thrash metal ever recorded and hear it played well; then you better get this.
B00065MDRW|4.0|This definitely was a good effort, it's not my favorite one by them, but it did start up Greg Lake for the future E.L&P. This has its highlights too with 21st Century Schizoid Man, pure progressive jazz right here, then it mellows out with I Talk to the Wind, and then eve of destruction with Epitaph. Never much cared for Moonchild, it's o.k., I think it drags a little. But the finale makes up for it with The Court of The Crimson King, pretty solid there, lots of good sounds there, almost good enough to have been on Saucerful of Secrets album by Floyd. If you like this album, you'll be blown away by Larks' Tongue in Aspic, I also prefer Three of a Perfect Pair.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I picked this up at a Asian movie store today, and now I'm glad I own a copy of the film. I watched this today and it was awesome! Totally killer.<br /><br />STORY: 42 15-year ols students go on a trip to an island. They are knocked out, and they wake up in a room where they learn they are in for a \\"battle royale\\", where they are forced to kill each other. The one man standing wins and gets to go home.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: A very entertaining movie. Plus, it has a good ending. The girls are HAWT!<br /><br />So go buy this movie!
0670034711|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love is a lovely memoir--the story of her travels in the wake of an emotionally devastating divorce and another emotionally draining romantic entanglement.  Gilbert does not dwell on those two relationships in this book, but rather focuses on her journey and why she took it.  She was crushed, devastated, but decided (with her publishers help) to spend a year trying to find her way back to where she wanted to be.  She spent some time in Italy learning Italian and eating well, followed by a stay at an ashram in India (run by a guru she met through her post-marriage boyfriend) and finally she stayed in Indonesia learning from a local medicine man she had met several years earlier.   <br /> <br />Gilbert's writing is breezy and honest--you feel as if you are sharing the secrets of your best friend from high school.  Her frank tone is disarming and engaging--she's not afraid to share her flaws and faults, foibles and mistakes.  The book can ramble at times--it lacks the cohesive narrative of a novel, but that is ultimately part of the book's charm.  Gilbert's quest for inner peace is a compelling philisophical journey, that never gets too heavy or dull.  This is an inspiring, entertaining read.  Enjoy.
0694013889|5.0|this is the fifth once upon a potty book that i have purchased ...over the years i have used this book with my children and grandchildren to help them get excited about being a big kid..great illustrations too.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite album by Floyd, and it was the second album to change their sound, first being Atom Heart Mother, which was number one in the U.K., funny too because they hated it so very much, I think they were very happy with this one and they should from the very beggining with One of These Days, to their 22 minutes finale with Echoes, Love this album, this get just as much or even more play than Dark Side of The Moon. If you like the samples of this album, try out Obscured by Clouds, or even get the Live in Pompei video, good stuff there.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can be said about what has to be one of the greatest achievements in rock history? Are there sufficient superlatives? <br /> <br />I've already tried to write the review for this album a billion times, and each time I end up erasing it, finding it exhausting and futile to capture my experience in words. That should tell you something. This is simply a landmark album to me, and nothing less. It changed the way I listened to rock music. My best headphone album of all time <br /> <br />The obvious question at this point of the review is \\"What about the music? Does it justify all this adulation?\\" My answer is trite: I don't think any album does, but given the quality of music and painstaking contruction evident on this album, I certainly don't begrudge its status. The album runs from the barely audible to the loud and blaring (hence its popularity amongst audiophiles), yet fits together elegantly as a single work. The songs all explore the 90s human existence; greed, death, xenophobia, the isolation of human emotions and communication by technology, and madness all have songs dedicated to them. <br /> <br />This is an emotional work, and anybody who cannot connect on that level is not going to appreciate this album. It is also a complex one, with a structure like a musical inolving reprisal of themes at key junctures, and rewards many repeated listenings. <br /> <br />No record collection, british or otherwise, is complete without Ok Computer
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Great disc.  Very creative.  If I could, I'd give it a 4.5.  Danger Mouse brought some year 4000 beats and Cee-Lo added some equally ahead of this millenium lyrics.  Problem is, @ 37 minutes, any misfire is glaringly obvious.  Definitely worth a purchase, though.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|This is the ultimate movie about the office world, and you owe it to yourself to watch this movie if you have ever worked in an office. The flair edition is great, and I especially love the portion about the consultants.
B00005JP0A|5.0|Meryl Streep does an excellent performance as ice cold editor Miranda Priestley in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\". She perfects an English accent like that of Anna Wintour. She is a no-holds barred woman who expects everyone to worship the ground she walks on; even if those under her are miserable. Andy, played by Ann Hathaway, is looking to further her career in journalism by working as her assistant for Runway magazine. She learns the cutthroat business of the magazine industry which is deeply contrasted to what she was doing in college and her true style of writing. She wanted to get into the industry but finds that it isn't so fair to her as well as the people who work for the publishing industry. <br />As an aspiring journalist/writer I know already that this type of industry isn't what I am seeking to get into. I don't want to sell my soul to the devil as what Andy did in the movie. It cost her her relationships with her closest friends and family. Although, if you want badly to be in the business as Emily, first assistant to Priestley, then you'd better dig into your heels and do what it takes to get there.  <br />Getting back to Ms. Streep, she is a serious actress and digs into this role excellently. The industry needs women like her that are no-nonsense and intelligent.
0375413405|5.0|This is the cookbook that formed the foundation for Julia Child's famous series \\"The French Chef.\\" Some parts of this edition recognize the new appliances available since the book was published 25 years before, like the food processor.  The recipes, however, are still classics.  Although Julia apologizes in the foreword for being neither French nor a trained chef, it is this well-written, comprehensive cookbook that helped to change the way Americans eat.  Although some of the recipes are a bit intimidating like entirely boning a chicken or duck, most are attainable.  For the best quiche you've ever made - buy the crust if you can't bake - make Julia's recipe for this Lorraine classic.
B0000035E7|3.0|I remember bying Bleach when it came out, i.e. before they were famous and I was extremely unimpressed. I was at the time much more impressed with TAD, Mudhoney and Soundgarden. It has not aged well...the sound is not that great and the songs are not on the same level as the great stuff they would deliver with Nevermind and later records. In many ways it sounds like a completey different, and very inferior, band.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This film was based on a graphic novel, but do not expect a lot of action scenes in it, because compared to the typical super-hero, comic book action flick, there are very few.  However, the story and ideas of this film are very well put together and thought-provoking providing good entertainment without the expense of too much mindless action.  The story is relatable to many societies and governments throughout human history and almost nowhere near relative to our current government and should not be mistaken as some poilitcal propaganda tool.  Anyone who believes this film to be a message to our government or having a hidden agenda is an idiot.  The film is great, well directed, well acted, and has some small flaws in it, but nothing you keep your mind on throughout the film.  The story keeps you engaged throughout the film and you are not just waiting for the next action scene. This movie is definitely recommended for anyone who likes an action film with a great story and doesn't succumb only to it's action.
B00005JOQS|4.0|This was an excellent revival of the franchise.  I hope it will be the last time Lex Luthor is in a Superman movie, he is an over used villian.  I was surprised about Lois and Superman having a son together, but it makes sense from the perspective of reviving the franchise 20 years from now.  It would be nice to see other DC superheros in the future movies.
0767802470|4.0|If you would like to know how life was on a German Submarine in WW2, then this is the movie for you. It will keep you glued to your seat.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in WW2 history and how the thoughts of German sailor's were not much different then our own.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It's a really good DVD set, 4 discs long with some really great performances particularly from Freddie Mercury and Queen, U2, The Boomtown Rats and much more.  It's really only a 4 star set but the fact that sales from this set still aid the hungry earns it that extra star.  It was all very moving to me and still is.  AND it's really awesome seeing all these music stars 20 years ago. They all look so young! <br />
0761129235|5.0|In my dissertation for my Ed.D., I used a quote which is quoted in this book:  \\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\\"  I think Dr. Maurer has made a significant contribution within the concept of Kaizen regarding the neurological and psychological importance of One Small Step Can Change your Life ....  The illustrations and examples he has given help to expand one's understanding of these concepts.  I have recommended this book to many of my friends.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|A delightful family film set in 19th century England -- you might think<br />of it as \\"Mary Poppins with warts and in need of orthodontic work.\\"<br /><br />(SPOILER) What I found most enjoyable about the story was the wholesome<br />effect that the unsightly Nanny McPhee has on the mischievous behavior<br />of the Brown children. Her \\"lessons\\" would benefit most households<br />today.<br /><br />Emma Thompson's acting & screenplay are excellent, but Thomas Sangster,<br />as the oldest Brown sibling, sparkles as the ring leader of this band<br />of nanny marauders.<br /><br />Fine performances by Colin Firth, Angela Landsbury, and Kelly McDonald<br />make this a very entertaining movie that will provide wholesome fun for<br />family members of all ages.
B000E1OI7G|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is, in my opinion, a well put-together masterpiece. It is a film that truly shows off the talent of its director and its stars in a completely interesting way. The acting is top-notch (be sure to look for Don Cheadle and Louis Guzman as two DEA agents and Steven Bauer as a California drug lord) and the cinematography is excellent. I would easily recommend Traffic to anyone interested in learning how to make a movie. 5 Stars
0553213105|5.0|This is a really nice novel, one of the great classics. Highly recommend it.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam and I have to say, they let me down with Riot Act and Binural, but I wanted to give this one a chance as a loyal fan. I was expecting no more than Riot Act, meaning maybe 3 or 4 good songs and the rest were ones that you always skip. I got it the day it came out, and the only time it has left my CD player, is when I was letting other people listen to it, because it is so impressive. Definately better than the 2 formentioned. The lyrical quality is awesome, and the instrumentals seem more simplistic I guess, giving it a raw enery like The Ramones had given us. This album was awesome to begin with, and it sounds even better today than it did 2 months ago. Give it a shot. You won't be sorry.
0385513755|5.0|What a fantastic edition! The pages are high quality, the pictures are absolutely beautiful; they completely enhance the book.
B00005JNRY|5.0|After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!<br /><br />With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this. A must see, and must own children's movie.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?<br /><br />Plus 2 extra bonus points for Tow Mater! Tow is a one one a kind children's movie character that will not soon be forgotten.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Between 1991 and 94 Pearl Jam released three of the best CDs of the decade.  Unfortunatley after \\"Vitalogy\\" the bands releases became more and more inconsistent.  Don't get me wrong each of the releases in the latter half of the 90s up through \\"Riot Act\\" in 02 had some good tunes but none of these CDs as a whole held up.  There live shows were still fantastic and it looked as if Pearl Jam was headed the way of the Grateful Dead and being known as a great live band that would be better served releasing there all of their shows on CD.  With their new self-titled release the band shows they can still put out a great record.  \\"Life Wasted\\" ,\\"Severed Hand\\", \\"Marker In the Sand\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" are some of the best songs they've ever recorded.  The band sounds re-energized on this CD.  Welcome back PJ!
B0006399FS|5.0|It's interesting to read all these interviews on here about how awful this album is and how U2 is overated from the non U2-fans.  Guess what non U2-fans??  Get over the fact that they are the most overrated rock band in the world.  Let me mention the fact that they were nominated for five grammy's and won every single one of them.  Hmmmmmm and the vertigo tour was a sell out immediately.  Yeah U2 is the best and what ever non-U2 fan listens to....IT SUCKS!!!  So shut the hell up about U2!  Give this album a chance for a first time listener.
B00004XMV6|2.0|It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . <br />Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching \\"I like to play games\\" , its a much better soft-porn movie. <br /> <br />
B000002GFC|5.0|Terrific compilation.  Makes you regret the commercialized, synthetic music industry we have today. These songs are very well performed and recorded. What we really need in this day and age is more talent and less posturing.
B00004YKUY|3.0|When a successful band brings in a new singer, historically the band will play it conservatively.   Most recently, the Australian band Inxs used a reality show to select a lead singer to replace the late Michael Hutchence.   Inxs would end up selecting J.D. Fortune, who had a very similar style to Hutchence and would achieve commercial success and critical acclaim.    Back in the 1980s, Van Halen replaced David Lee Roth with Sammy Hagar.   Hagar's style made time tailor fit for the vocal style required for Van Halen's music.    Therefore when Journey decided to move forward and replace Steve Perry, it wasn't a surprise that they brought in a vocalist similar to Perry's style.    What was amazing is the vocalist - Steve Augeri has almost an identical voice to Perry himself.    Augeri's first full album with his new band-mates would be 2001's \\"Arrival\\" album.   \\"Arrival\\" does show a lot of signs of the old Journey, but it definitely isn't at the level of the work that Journey produced in the 1980s. <br /> <br />One thing that is important to realize is how integrated Perry had become in Journey.   Guitarist Neal Schon has been with Journey since the beginning and had earned the right to be considered the band's leader.   Keyboardist Jonathan Cain joined the band later and became a major songwriting contributor to the band.    Perry, like Cain was a major songwriting force within the band.  Perry had also taken his hand at producing - producer 1986's \\"Raised on Radio\\" album.     While the band members would change within Journey, it would be the nucleus of Perry, Schon, and Cain that would take Journey to its greatest heights.   The trio also was Journey's main songwriting combination.    Perry's departure immediately would create a void in the creative trio.    There is no question about Augeri's vocal abilities - they are right on target and fit Journey perfectly.   While Augeri was also brought in to make songwriting contributions, the songwriting dynamics of Journey had changed.    As a result, Journey brings in outside songwriters to work with Schon and Cain.     In some cases, things work.    In other cases, the band seems like the focus is lost. <br /> <br />It is worth noting that \\"Arrival\\" saw Journey bring in a new drummer.   Longtime drummer Steve Smith, who had recently returned to Journey decided not to continue with Journey when Perry left.    Schon and Cain brought in drummer Deen Castronovo to the band - whom they had worked with in Bad English.   Long time bassist Ross Valory, who also rejoined Journey in the 1990s decided to stay around for the \\"Arrival\\" album. <br /> <br />One of the outside songwriters that immediately caught my attention was the addition of Jack Blades.   Blades is most famous for his work with the band Night Ranger.  Blades is known for writing what I term \\"power ballads\\" with Night Ranger. Those songs that feature a mix of softer vocals and heavy guitar, bass, and keyboards.  \\"Power Ballads\\" mesh nicely with Journey   Blades contributes songwriting to four tracks - these tracks happen to be in the upper echelon of the songs included on the collection: \\"Higher Place\\", \\"World Gone Wild\\", \\"I Got a Reason\\", and \\"Kiss Me Softly\\".   It is also worth mentioning that Eric Bazilian of the Hooters also contributed songwriting to the song \\"To Be Alive Again\\". <br /> <br />The album gets off to a very good start with the song \\"Higher Ground\\".   This gives us an introduction to Augeri as the lead vocalist.   This song is a classic Journey song with all of the components clicking perfectly - Schon's guitar, Cain's Keyboards, Valory's Bass, and Castronovo's Drums are in perfect sync.  However it is going to be Augeri's vocals that take this song to the next level.   Augeri immediately establishes himself as a worthy successor to Perry and proves without a shadow of a doubt that he belongs in Journey.   On the surface, I assumed that this classic Journey sound had the Schon and Cain combination written allover it.   However this was a song written by Schon and Blades.   Blades shows he has no problem in integrating his songwriting style with Journey. <br /> <br />\\"Higher Ground\\" was the first song on the collection - it really pumped me up.   After that, I felt the next four songs really didn't impress or excite me and were kind of boring.  When I started to look at the titles of the songs of \\"Arrival\\", I found many of them to be boring.   Many of the titles just seemed \\"bland\\" - \\"All the Way\\", \\"All the Things\\", \\"Loved by You\\", \\"Lifetime of Dreams\\", \\"With Your Love\\", and \\"Live and Breathe\\" are all examples of song names that really didn't impress me much.    Perhaps this is because the Steve Perry connection is no longer there.  Only \\"Higher Ground\\" and \\"World Gone Wild\\" really impressed me from a song title standpoint. <br /> <br />The end of the album is where the strength is.  Next to \\"Higher Ground\\" it is \\"Nothin Comes Close\\", \\"Kiss Me Softly\\", and \\"We Will Meet Again\\" that are the best songs.  \\"Nothin Comes Close\\" has a bluesy feel to it and features some pretty cool improvising at the end of the song when they joke about Augeri's \\"red leather pants\\".   Other good songs include the haunting ballad \\"Livin to Do\\" and \\"World Gone Wild\\". \\"Livin to Do\\" has the classic power ballad feel to it and features some classic guitar by Schon.   Other solid songs include \\"I Got a Reason\\" and \\"Lifetime of Dreams\\". <br /> <br />One thing that I give Journey credit for is that they stuck to the style of music they have always done.  Many artists have tried to reinvent themselves by playing to today's guitar-laden post-grunge style of music.  Journey isn't afraid to stick with the combination of keyboards and guitars.    While the results of this collection are mixed, it still shows that Journey can be Journey even though they have had to adapt to change.  Journey fans should still be satisfied.  This collection is worth checking out.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|Every time I read a negative review of the original Lonesome Dove (although there are VERY few bad ones) it makes me want to reach through the computer screen, grab the reviewer by the shirt and say \\"what the #@%$!! are you talking about?!?!?!\\" <br /> <br />As long as we're talking about the original 360+ minute miniseries, starring Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, then we are talking about one of the greatest stories every put to film.  The story, the characters, the acting are all top notch.  The production values, even from a 1989 TV event, are all on par with most theatrical movies, except for a few very minor \\"special effects\\" sequences which show some signs of age and budget constraints. <br /> <br />In my life, I have never seen a better, more human, more realistic, more emotionally connected story than Lonesome Dove.  Most Westerns, while they may have their dramatic merits, are unfortunately poor portrayals of the American West as it was in the 1800's.  They are almost always overly romanticized, melodramatic stories which have little resemblance to what it must have actually been like. <br /> <br />Lonesome outshines them all, finally presenting the Old West as it probably truly was.  A wild country filled with REAL people, living hard lives with real relationships, adventures, emotions and heartbreak.  In fact, Lonesome Dove outshines most all movies and series in general, not just westerns. <br /> <br />And don't get me wrong, while it certainly has its share of death, sadness and hardship, Lonesome Dove is a wonderful viewing experience, full of life, humor and adventure. <br /> <br />Lonesome Dove is my favorite movie.  Please give it a chance. <br /> <br />
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|The soundtrack sounded refreshing and unique. Many of the tracks left a chilling impression on me, especially Passacagl ia, Kobal's Last Gleaming, and The Shape of Things to Come. <br />Two Funerals, and Forgiven has that nice emotional feeling to it. <br />The music that accompanied the battle scenes and tense situations in the show is amazing, the fast beating of drums and etc. enhances the tension. McCreary knows how to compose. <br /> <br />All in all, the soundtrack has a wide range of style and sound to it in each track, from Classical Symphony, New Age, and a little bit of Techno.
038073186X|4.0|That's my reaction after rolling thru the last 75 pages.  You'll stay up late to finish it, I think.  Some of the bad reviews on here, people complaining they gave up on it halfway through -- spot on, I don't doubt it.  Lesser Lehane...yeah, it sure seemed like it for much of the book.  But most of those people who didn't finish it made a big mistake.  The last third of the book makes all the crap that came before it worthwhile.<br /><br />I wish I could say more, but I'm not into spoilers.  Suffice it to say that this is NOT bad Lehane, but his story made it useful for him for a while for you to think that it was.  That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars...lots of eye rolling early...but I'm not sure he really could have done it any other way....
6305922756|5.0|If you are a rock fan and you have a good sense of humor, then this is the ultimate. The band Spinal Tap comes up with some of the stupidest songs but they can still rock. The Parodies in the movie nail how over the top metal and rock bands can be. I suggest buying this movie because it never gets old and it's just plain good.
1931559317|5.0|As a professional astronomer, I have been surfing plenty of sky atlases, ranging from very simple to heavy and complete ones. This book is just great for those observing the heavens with thier own binoculars or telescope, as everything is in your hands, requiring just a little space. The choice to divide the whole sky in RA is a good one, as you have the season maps close each other. You have stars down to magnitude 7.5 and the maps are really accurate and a joy to look at. The milky way is reproduced with two different colours, accounting for the different star densities. You can quickly skip to any other map, thanks to the general index and indications given on each page. <br /> <br />Plenty of double and variable stars, as well as deep sky wonders complete this book, which is going to stay w <br />very close to my portable telescopes by now.
0783227434|3.0|OK...this version is only good if you cannot get hold of the 2 disc version or the original release. It's had too much cut out and changed that made the film a classic!

0525948023|4.0|This book has a lot of good ideas in it.  It's written simply enough so if you are not a spiritual seeker or don't even know what that is, you can pick this up and like it. <br /> <br />The book describes how the \\"ego\\" works and what to do about it to be more at peace.  Personally, I don't see Eckhart Tolle as \\"enlightened\\", he describes ways of purifying the \\"ego\\" and if you were to do everything he writes, you would be saintly, not \\"enlightened\\". I think \\"enlightenment\\" is a term thrown around too much in the spiritual world.    <br /> <br />But anyway, if you like to read different ideas about why we're here, how to be in the present and at peace, this book is a non-quackish, interesting read.
B00005JOX6|5.0|\\"Click\\" is an enjoyable movie that follows no real pattern of expectations.  I rate a movie by how predictable or unpredictable it is.  And that's \\"Click\\"'s strongest point.  I don't believe people saw where this movie was taking us.<br /><br />Yes, there is a bit of bathroom (just not in the bathroom) type comedy that really didn't need to be in the movie.  I don't find dogs humping a stuffed toy duck nearly as funny as Adam Sandler must.  But if I overlook that little flaw, I think \\"Click\\" is Sandler's best movie to date.<br /><br />I know I feel like there is not enough time in the day to accomplish what should be done each day, so I completely understand how Sandler's character would be thrilled to be able to take control of his life using a super-remote-controller, given to him by Morty (Christopher Walken) in the Beyond section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond store.  That part alone was completely hilarious!<br /><br />Michael Newman (Sandler's character) lives next door to a family who always has the best of everything, and I really loved how Sandler and the writers included the annoying brat Kevin O'Doyle (played by Cameron Monaghan) into the mix.  His rants and raves about his family's luxuries, and Newman's comebacks, added some good filler to this movie.  People in the audience cheered when the little brat finally got what he had coming.  That means ya did good Monaghan, ya got people to really hate you!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is amazing in this production, landing her role at every opportunity given.  This woman is one of the best actresses in Hollywood.  Playing the role of a wife whose husband seems to be losing his mind, not to mention his family, cannot be an easy part, yet Beckinsale does it to perfection.  If you haven't seen her in Underworld or Underworld: Evolution, I suggest you check those movies out as well.<br /><br />Christopher Walken (Morty) is always a joy to watch on screen, and while this role doesn't really let him shine, he does manage to turn in a performance that delivers some of his famous facial quirks that just make ya wonder if he's not really just a little insane in real life.  Walken is a genius, like James Woods, even if the younger generation can't see it.<br /><br />David Hasselhoff (Newman's Boss, Ammer) is the one weak link in this film.  I wouldn't even let this guy get through an audition for a high school play casting mimes.  Hasselhoff may be one of the worst actors of all times!  I can't believe I used to watch Knight Rider as a kid.  I was young and dumb back then, so please forgive me.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Henry Winkler's role in this film!  Talk about a realistic, witty, and gutsy performance, this is it.  Just like James Garner nailed his role in The Notebook, Winkler may have turned in his best movie performance to date.<br /><br />\\"Click\\" is a combination of the old Adam Sandler (silly kid jokes) and the new Adam Sandler (acting gone good).

0743277708|5.0|An epic story told from the perspective of a group of rabbits.  A classic must-read for nature lovers of all ages.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is, perhaps, the most powerful movie of the year, which takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.
0743454529|5.0|I will not review the story of the novel as there are other reviewers who do this.   <br />It took me a year to finally read this book, but it took only a day to finish it.  When I walked past airport bookstores after my father passed on, I didn't think I was ready to read about medical matters and cancer. The book is medically quite accurate (I am a physician and a mother of a child with a chronic illness.)   <br />I was struck by the effect a sick child has on the other children in the family.  It is fascinating to be able to see in their minds, how they act out, how they get pushed aside by parents who are too swept up in the chaos to see the whole family dynamic.  This story and the skill of Picoult's writing exceeded my expections.  The lawyer romance was a distraction which added little to the plot.
0380789035|3.0|The short description on the back of \\"American Gods\\" immediately captures the reader's attention.  The main character, Shadow, is flying home for his wife's funeral, when he meets Mr. Wednesday, a man who knows much more about him than he should.  From that moment on, Shadow's life will never be the same.  After initially trying to escape from this 'bad dream', Shadow finds himself working for Mr. Wendesday and suddenly finds himself the target of some very strange people.<br /><br />As it turns out, Mr. Wednesday is a god.  When people immigrated to America, they brought their beliefs in various gods with them, and those gods took on identities in the new world.  But as the years passed, and people worshipped them less and less, they were (and are) being replaced by new gods of the modern age.  Wednesday's plan is to wage a battle against these new gods so that he and the others will not be a dying breed.  This plot takes him and Shadow across the country as they try to convince the forgotten gods, who now make a living through cons and the like, to join his side.  It is not an easy task, one in which Shadow encounters life-threatening situations, and is trailed by his dead and slowly rotting wife, Laura, one of a vast cast of colorful characters.<br /><br />While that may be a difficult premise to accept, it works; sort of.  Without a doubt, \\"American Gods\\" is an extremely well-written novel.  Gaiman is a gifted author who crafts stories that draw the readers into the characters and narrative.  Shadow is a likeable narrator, but one who I always pictured exactly opposite of his description.  The journey through the backroads of America and through the systems of beliefs is intriguing and original.  Yet there seemed to be something missing the entire novel; whether that is a cohesion between intention and what's written on the page, or the susceptibility of the readers to the premise of the novel, a key component is missing and not enough loose ends are tied up.  Truthfully, after finishing, I'm not quite sure what to think.  Even though I enjoyed the novel on many levels, it's not one that I can praise as highly as I thought I would be able to..

B0002NRRAG|5.0|Fortanately, I am in the DC area where we have public radio.  I heard \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\" and immediately copped Careless Love and absolutely loved it.  Then I went back and purchased Dreamland, another treat.  Hopefully she doesn't make us wait nearly another decade.  But I'm also glad that she isn't being rushed into producing an album a year either.
0380018179|4.0|The book starts with the legend of the thornbird - a bird who searches all his life for a thorn bush and once he finds it, impales himself on the thorn and while doing so sings the most beautiful song, even better that that of a lark or a nightingale and the song is so beautiful that even God smiles.  <br /> <br />For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain.  <br /> <br />This single sentence seems to sum up the common element binding the entire book. <br /> <br />The Thornbirds is the story of the Cleary family, and their journey from their unpretentious roots in New Zealand where they worked as sheep shearers, to the huge Australian sheep farm Drogheda, owned by Paddy Cleary's autocratic sister. The family being Irish, the land is in their blood and from the time that they arrive on Drogheda the land plays a unmistakeable part in their fortunes and destinies. The story spans 3 generations from Paddy Cleary and his wife Fiona, their sons and only daughter Meggie and the Catholic priest Ralph De Bricassart, to Meggie's children - the exotic actress Justine and priest Dane. <br /> <br />But we see all this mostly through the interaction of Meggie with her family and her forbidden love for Father Ralph. <br /> <br />The author Colleen McCullough has a wonderful descriptive style of writing. From the the dry dust, heat and flies of the Australian Outback, the relentless forces of nature like storms, drought, wildfires, to the power-hungry corridors of the Vatican all are brought to life in the pages of this book. And the element of love and pain is dealt with in a balanced way and not over excessively. <br /> <br />However, only the main characters are really 3D, and I often found myself skipping through large parts of the book that didn't interest me. <br /> <br />Overall it is a must read as it makes us realize love is not just demanding and wanting its more so about giving and sacrificing.

B00003CXTG|3.0|First, let me say I've read a lot of reviews of this film and have the reviews of numerous veterans I know who liked the special effects and action, not the story. I am a historian myself. I read \\"A lot\\" about World War 2, and numerous other wars. I love history. I read history books and biographies<br /><br />like other people read novels.<br /><br />  When I read that this movie was being filmed, and who would<br /><br />be starring, I dismissed it right away. To me, \\"Tora,Tora, Tora\\"<br /><br />was the best film I'd seen about Pearl Harbor. I had \\"no interest\\" in another attempt by Hollywood to recreate it....<br /><br />When it was released to theatres, I didn't rush out to see it.<br /><br />I read the reviews then, and figured I'd rent the movie when it was out on tape, and be \\"done\\" with it. Nope!<br /><br />  I got the video of the movie as a present. I watched it, and<br /><br />while cringing at some of the casting...Jon Voight as President Roosevelt...Alec Baldwin as Billy Mitchell!, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Is it \\"entirely\\" factual? It is NOT. If you've watched and owned as much Hollywood versions of war, though, how many of them are? I think people in my parent's day were a little more tolerant of those films then the people I read here. This movie was never advertised as a remake of Tora, Tora, Tora or as<br /><br />a documentary. The director and film company \\"did\\" seek the<br /><br />consultation of numerous veterans. I don't beleive this movie disrespects them in any way.<br /><br />  I liked the basic plot of two lifelong buddies fighting<br /><br />over a girl. I didn't like the script or the movie's length.<br /><br />I have the Director's Cut on DVD,and I've watched the movie<br /><br />numerous times...It's not great,but its not as bad as some here have suggested. If you want more factual films watch a documentary. Neither the director, nor the film company ever said this movie was one. It is what it is.<br /><br />  Atreides
B000A59PMO|5.0|This programme is a real find.  I bought the DVDs on the basis of reviews I'd read and  wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed both 'Wonderfalls' and 'Tru Calling' and was looking for a funny, smart, replacement and Veronica Mars certainly is that - especially as there is at least a second season to look forward to.  The wit of Buffy, an intriguing 'arc' concerning Lilly's death and a truly endearing herione.  Veronica is both sensitive and sassy.  Can't wait for the second season DVDs to be released.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Seriously, if you have not seen, or do not own this video, you cannot call yourself a Who fan. <br /> <br />This is the ultimate Who compilation.  \\"My Generation\\" from Smothers Brothers, \\"Pinball Wizard\\" from Woodstock, and many other rare performances, plus promo films, interview bits, etc. come together to produce the best collection of Who footage ever assembled.  Better still, every clip on here features the original band, no replacements.  This makes it a worthy investment for any true Who fan. <br /> <br />I've said enough.  Buy it and rock on.
B00005JOQS|4.0|it's all superb, except the action. i think it's Mr.Singer's weakness in all his super heroe movies. He goes into the emotions of the characters, but when it comes to it, something is missing. the actions although enough number of them don't really suck us into what's happening. (Like the X-2's oval-office break-in, the plane rescue was thrilling but only that, just the first action.  it's probably because Mr.singer's background as one of the graet indie filmakers who focus on the story and characters). but don't get me wrong, go see the movie.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I read an interview recently, in which Bryan Singer, the director, said that this movie is his first love story.  He wasn't joking.<br /><br />Yes, there is some action, some spectacular flying, and great special effects.  However Superman is best in its small moments, and it truly is a love story.<br /><br />The acting (except for Parker Posey... I don't like her as an actor) and directing is stellar.  However, I almost want to say that the sets steal the show.  A lot of care evidently went into this film.<br /><br />And the music!  Awesome.<br /><br />Don't bother sticking around to see the end of the credits.. there isn't a suprise added on.  The movie ends when the credits begin to roll.
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is engaging for about eighty percent of the book after which it becomes a slow somewhat laborious read. The story line is very predictable and written with an obvious Hollywood slant. Hence the movie...<br /><br />Dan Brown is a very good writer but this book is not one of his best. Check out \\"Angles and Demons\\" or \\"Decpetion Point\\" for more engaging and less predictable storylines. The former, A&D, being a difficult book to put down right through the final pages!

B000EHSVS2|4.0|Patton is an all time favorite of mine.  I have now owned five video incarnations of this movie, from Magnetic Video VHS to CBS/FOX VHS to widescreen laserdisc to the THX DVD 2 disc edition to this latest edition.  Here is the bottom line comparing the two DVD editions:  This new edition's color is slightly better than the previous THX edition.  This edition shows a bit more of the bottom of the frame, but a bit less of the left side.  This edition's sound is markedly better than the THX edition.  However the THX edition has a MUCH sharper video transfer...the best examples are the details visible in the closeups of Patton's right arm saluting the camera and the medals on his uniform, all at the beginning of the movie.  You can count the hairs on his hand and see many more medal details in the THX edition.  So Fox has yet to put together the definitive video transfer, which will hopefully be corrected when they finally release this in (whichever) high definition format.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|When I went to pick up this cd at the local music store last week, i was expecting a very good cd, something that when compared to the debut album, would be just as equally amazing.  Well, when I played it, i was pleasently surprised with what my ears heard.  Since the release of the self-titled album, Three Days Grace has definately matured as a group.  You can tell that their lyrics and guitars are much deeper and more involved than the previous cd.  Although, my only complaint would be that many of the songs sound the same.  But that's ok considering all the songs sound amazing!  I would definately say go get this cd whether you're a fan of Three Days Grace or not.  This one has moved to the top of my playlist with \\"Pain\\", \\"Time of Dying\\", \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Let it Die\\", and of course \\"Animal I Have Become\\".  This cd probably deserves 6 stars, but the limit is 5...so....5 stars for Three Days Grace!

B00004TH6O|3.0|I was a little behind the times with QOTSA.  I first heard Songs For The Deaf in like May of '05 and fell in love with it instantly.  Shortly after that I bought \\"Lullabies\\" and IT took a few listens before I considered it as good as I think it is now - which is better than Rated R.  Obviously it sounds as though it was mixed better than Songs For The Deaf, but I think the point of \\"Deaf\\" was that it's supposed to sound like a cheap radio (that's kinda lame) There are some good jams on THIS cd, don't get me wrong - if you can get it for under $10 then do it.  I am just saying, for the record, that in my opinion the two fore-mentioned cds are far superior to this one.
0385336691|5.0|Unlike other mystery writers, Child's work does not get stale over time, it only gets better.  In this installment, he presents us with a lesser than perfect Jack Reacher but his ability to ruthlessly deal with plagues of society has not changed. The book reminds me a lot of the Persuader in that Reacher is hired by a wealthy yet shady man to do a job for him.  <br /> <br />If you are new to Child novels, this is a good place to start.

I have been reading to Amanda since birth and her favorite things are animals. Ms. Numeroff's books are chock filled with animals. Bedtime for her becomes funtime when I bring out a couple of Ms. Numeroff's books, such as, If you give a mouse a cookie or if you give a pig a pancake (just to name a few) Her age group is really geared to pre-school age kids. I hope she writes more books and would highly recommend her to other parents of pre-schoolers.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Guys-this is a pretty safe movie to get for a date with your wife.<br /><br />John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale play the roles of Jonathan and Sarah exceptionally well.  The story line lacks credibility in several places, but it's unique and packs some good surprises.<br /><br />The basic paradigm of this movie rests on the fallacies of new age world views, and the movie takes several swipes at those very paradigms...but then goes on to prove it's true.  So as a Christian, I would point out that this is only entertainment...and that people should not put their lives into the hands of the mystery of fate (as Serendipity teaches by inference).<br /><br />Now that I've said that....let me say that we probably will watch this movie again.  It gives you a good feeling and has a great ending.  Both actors are enchanting and the whole experience is a positive one.
B000FMGTTE|2.0|As much as I enjoyed Superman Returns, I was extremely disappointed in Ottman's addition to Williams' classic score. Let's get this out of the way first: The Superman March, Planet Krypton, Prelude and Main Titles, and the Love Theme From Superman (Can You Read My Mind?) define Superman. Perhaps it was accidental, but when we think of Superman now, these are the tracks that instantly come to mind. I am infinitely glad that Bryan Singer chose to incorporate the classic score into the film.    What saddens and disappoints me is John Ottman's addition to the score which, while sometimes rising above the muck, usually comes off as either filler music or sounding like a weepy soap opera refrain. There were times while watching the film that the score clashed with the images and action on screen (somewhat like the score for Troy).    I say that the Ottman score saddens me because, well, it truly does. It was definitely not what I expected to underscore such a heroic, classic figure as Superman. I hope that with the sequel, Mr. Singer will either see fit to get a new composer or attempt to redefine what the score needs to be with Ottman.

THEY ALL SUCK, And the Beatles White Album has to be one of the stupidest, dumbest CDs on the planet contains awful jokes in WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, Each and every song <br />especially that one is awful. Stay far away from this and go download songs from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, GNR, and Nirvana insted. I'm glad you can't download THE BEATLES as they suck.
B000EGDC0A|5.0|After watching Goldfrapp perform \\"Ooh La La\\" on Jools Holland's show I was hooked and instantly bought their album a couple of weeks later. I was hooked, their fusion of disco, glam-rock and electronica is extremely addictive. Alison Goldfrapp's voice teamed up with Will Gregory's production mastery is superb. This album is a lovely array of sounds from the robotic \\"Ride A White Horse\\" to the guitar and synth duet of \\"Ooh La La\\".<br /><br />The album opens with a single, \\"Ooh La La\\". The most successfull single off the album it's quite fitting that it opens such a great album. Alison's voice sounds very manufactured and vocoder-fed, but that adds to the disco feel of the song.<br /><br />\\"Lovely 2 C U\\" has a very epic feel to it, with it's opening combo vocals , to the superb instrumentation. The song has a very commercial feel to it and flows on well from the previous song.<br /><br />\\"Ride On A White Horse\\" has a similar vocoder feel to the vocals as \\"Ooh La La\\". The song is very robotic and has a march rhythm to it. It feels very retro, but not dated by any means.<br /><br />\\"You Never Know\\" sounds like it came from their debut album, the critically lauded \\"Felt Mountain\\". It's string instrumentation gives it a little bit of Eastern flair.<br /><br />\\"Let It Take You\\" is a very chilled-out track, it sounds like a cross between a dimmed down Frou Frou and a very subtle Bjork. The overall feel makes it seem like an electronic lullaby. Very calming.<br /><br />\\"Fly Me Away\\" has all the things Goldfrapp are good at, husky vocals and superbly programmed electronic beats, the chorus here is very well structured indeed.<br /><br />\\"Slide In\\" has a lovley swirling electronica background instrumentation, I like that cute \\"wowo-ow\\" thing Alison does, it's very sexy.<br /><br />\\"Koko\\" starts with some epic strings and sounds a lot like \\"You Never Know\\", except it's a lot more commercial and has a better rhythm.<br /><br />\\"Satin Chic\\" is very retro and I can picture Alison prancing around in a cute satin dress while serenading this song to many Goldfrapp followers at a nightclub in New York.<br /><br />\\"Time Out From The World\\" takes over from where \\"Let It Take You\\" left off, except this time it has more of a trip-hop feel to it.<br /><br />The album ends with the lovely \\"Number 1\\". There is so much I love about this track, it has such a warm feel. I like the accessibilty of it as well. Alison's voice leave you wanting to listen to the whole album again.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Supernature\\" is a very solid album, it satisfied me for every second and I thoroughly am interested in purchasing the rest of their albums after also having their debut on loan from the local library a few weeks back. If you like Frou Frou or Portishead, you will love this album.an picture Alison prancing around in a cute satin dress while serenading this song to many Goldfrapp followers at a nightclub in New York. <br /> <br />\\"Time Out From The World\\" takes over from where \\"Let It Take You\\" left off, except this time it has more of a trip-hop feel to it. <br /> <br />The album ends with the lovely \\"Number 1\\".

0743487486|5.0|this book is wonderful. I am re-reading it for the third time, and every time i am reminded how important it is to be a mindful, caring parent. How important it is not to dismiss your children's requests, needs, demands. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B000BQ7D9E|3.0|i loved the cast members.. but what was up with that bland story line? OMG. i don't know if it was the story line or the directing but i was so disappointed in the film.  it was a shame.  well at least i got to see some of my favorite actresses of all time in there :) and john cusack. :)
B000005ZGZ|5.0|By far their best album in regards to musical composition. A must for any Fugazi fan. Some say it's \\"too jammy\\" but I believe it's part of the natural evolution of the band. Fugazi probably never would have gone on to make \\"the Argument\\" without \\"End Hits\\" as its precursor. A great album.
B00005NOM0|5.0|Well.. I saw this one, before the \\"original\\". :) so.. for me, I liked this one better :)  Elizabeth Perkins is beautiful and unlike the original movie character, she has a bit more softness to her, which I found beautiful.   <br /> <br />The little girl who played her daughter was wonderful too. Actually the whole cast was :) <br /> <br />Definitely worth the money, and don't forget the original. I liked that one, but I loved this one &hearts;.
1400032717|5.0|I read with amusement the reviews of the people who didn't get this book....and of course they wouldn't, since this book is written from the point of view of a teenaged boy who's head is wired differently from the average person's. As a person with Asperger's and as a parent of the child on a spectrum, I can say with absolute certainty that Mark Haddon gets it, and he has written a true word portrait of a young man who has a story to tell. What makes it so true is Christopher's voice; I laughed out loud many times throughout in recognition, almost as many times as I cringed. <br /> <br />It was an enjoyable read. It was a painful read. But it's a read that will be with me a long time. Thanks, Mark Haddon.
B000002NFM|5.0|when i first listen to the song,`firestarter', i was hooked!!! <br />pulsating,hynoptic... <br />one of the greatest of  electronic track i have ever listen to...just never tired listening to this track... <br />great car music!!! <br /> <br />other tracks are great to listen to(that is probably why these  tracks like mindfields,smack my bitch up are movie soundtracks) <br /> <br />ultimately,this is prodigy's best album yet!! <br />must buy!!
B000F7CMRM|1.0|The images, mostly of familiar, stereotypical people and institutions we read about, are not I expect meant to provide depth and insight. <br /> <br />I get the images as they are shuffled through; but not a lot of meaning comes through. Nothing new, no insights or informative portrayals. Like, all headline and no bodycopy.  <br /> <br />The writer/director's aim seems all for style's sake. But with such a complex subject, a wee bit of comprehension would've been maybe something which would have saved this scramble of half-made, flickering observations. A sad disappointment, considering what I thought to be extremely talented people.
B00005U2JL|4.0|41/2 stars for this dvd Manson always puts out the best shows, you can hate him or love him but you'll have a great time. This dvd looks and sounds great the only problem is that you have shots from more than one show ans sometimes it gets a little confusing.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Truman Capote was such a wretched, damaged, and contemptible caricature of a man that lobbing salvos at him seems unsportsmanlike; indeed, despite his abrasive superciliousness he was so pathetic as to engender not disdain but pity.  Ironically, this well-crafted film finds us recoiling in horror as we witness Capote's descent into complete moral oblivion, while the cold blooded killers he exploits appear increasingly like hapless victims of a devious opportunist.  Capote is a very small movie that focuses a laser beam on one specific thing, the relationship between Capote and the killers.  In doing so, it is able to carefully, and leisurely, develop a very nuanced and subtle psychological drama, a drama almost as chilling as the slaughter of four innocents in a desolate Kansas farmhouse.<br /><br />There is a sense in which all writers are vampires, invading the inner lives of others for material.  Under the best of circumstances this process occurs in good faith, with respect for the subjects and their dignity.  What we see here is what it looks like under the worst of circumstances, when there is only bad faith, betrayal, callous narcissism, and an endless succession of lies. Capote makes his deal with the devil and gets his reward, heightened celebrity and a fabulously successful book.  In retrospect, however, his methods cast doubt on the book's credibility, and the price he paid was dear, typewriter silenced, suicide by alcohol.  Not as quick as hanging, but probably more tortured.<br /><br />Many wonderful performances in this picture.  Clifton Collins, Jr. is faultless as Perry Smith, the limited, almost childishly innocent killer Capote has set his sights on.  Catherine Keener's Harper Lee is equally on point, while Bob Balaban is perfectly cast as New Yorker Editor William Shawn.  Which brings us to Philip Seymour Hoffman's celebrated embodiment of Truman Capote, a subject presenting two different problems.  The first is that his recreation is so uncanny one feels one has spent two hours in the presence of Truman Capote, roughly the equivalent of a month in Leavenworth.  The second is the effortless way Hoffman slips into Capote's tiny shoes, almost as if the part had been designed for him.  Indeed, from The Talented Mr. Ripley to Magnolia to Along Came Polly, Hoffman is always exactly the same person; pasty, bloated, debauched, passing for straight, alcoholic, corrupt, and completely devoid of moral fiber.  This is a man who, if he noticed a burning bishop on the other side of the street, would not cross that street to pour his beer on the bishop's head.  So, while the performance may be justifiably admired, I am more inclined to tip my hat to the casting director.spent two hours in the presence of Truman Capote, roughly the equivalent of a month in Leavenworth.

B00006CXSS|5.0|The movie is definitely a step up over watching it on History Channel especially with 5.1 digital dobly.
0316172324|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which creatively examines the impact and implications of making snap decisions. The variety of examples the author puts forth to explore the significance of intuition is exciting and fascinating. Gladwell finds one aspect that virtually all major industries and successful people in those industries have in common. He uses professional athletes, art historians, music producers, soft drink companies, etc., to show how meaningful it can be to give heed to the most basic instincts we have. I think that he has made an excellent study, however \\"cursory\\" it may be. I found that I was able to relate to many of the situations in the book, especially the consequences of over-thinking and second guessing yourself. When intuition is a result of subconscious or unconscious \\"knowledge\\" and not the result of a psycho-emotional judgment (rooted in neuroses), than I think it has the power to help us make excellent decisions that can transform our lives in an instant.
B000FGGE68|1.0|I was surprised that I disliked this movie as much as I did.  The previews actually looked pretty good.  Milla has done some good action films (i.e. 5th Element) and thought this could be another one.<br /><br />I'd call it low quality at best.  The CGI is blatant and in some scenes a disgrace.  The actual sets they do use are used over and over again, you get a feeling the city is three blocks by three blocks.<br /><br />While the first fighting scenes were good, the same things just kept happening and happening.  Great, she walked into the middle of a circle of enemies.  Over and over and over.<br /><br />That isn't even the real detractor, the acting sucked!  The enemy was awful, the kid was annoying, the tech sidekick was just scuzzy and distracting, and Milla couldn't act her way out of a  bag in this one.<br /><br />I'd consider this more of a Spawn type action movie.  Do not buy.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This was a surprisingly outstanding film, I was really captivated. Full of fascinating perspectives on the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War, strategic bombing, Vietnam, etc, from the point of view of one of the chief orchestrators.  <br /> <br />Most eerie quote... <br /> <br />On March 10, 1945, the US Air Force dropped incendiery bombs on Tokyo, starting a firestorm which killed 100,000 peopple, mainly civilians. <br /> <br />McNamara:(Rhetorically) \\"Is it moral to kill 100,000 people; civilians, women and children, in one night?\\" <br /> <br />Interviewer: \\"Did you know ahead of time that that was what was going to happen?\\" <br /> <br />McNamara: \\"In a sence, I was a part of a mechanism that in effect, recommended it.\\"  <br /> <br />He is an amazingly intelligent man, went to Berkley, youngest associate professor at Harvard, president of the Ford Motor Company, secretary of defense for 7 years. <br /> <br />A brilliant, keen analytical, engineering type mind. Loves data and analysis, asks the right questions, yet presided over a titanic failure of leadership and vision. Why? He says it was a constant struggle of differeing opinions between him and LBJ. That their compromises included the worst of both perspectives. McNamara wanted to pull out of Vietnamn entirely by the end of 1965. LBJ refused to appease the communists, and kept upping the ante. They never had enough to win, but they always made sure they had plenty to lose. No strategy for winning the war, no exit plan. No way politically to admit defeat. Sound familiar? <br /> <br />McNamara admitted they were fighting the cold war, while the Vietnamese were fighting a war of colonial liberation. It was a complex disconnect of cognitive frameworks. McNamara totally misunderstood the nature of the (1,000 year) relationship between Vietnam and China. McNamara wrote three books, one dealing specifically with talks later with DRV leaders, in which these misunderstandings came out. He said, \\"we all make mistakes,no military commander doesn't make mistakes and those mistakes get people killed, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands, or tens of thousands, but you have to learn from those mistakes and not make them again, but maybe you will make them 3 or four times, but not 5.\\" He also said \\"there is no learning period with nuclear weapons, one mistake and you destroy nations.\\"  <br /> <br />If you re a thinking person interesting in history, politics, expediency, warcraft or bureaucracy, you should find this film captivating.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Its definately a movie I'd take to college with me for some great ideas (streaking, haha) and for a good laugh.  I didnt think there was alot of nudity though for what the edition said.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|I like watching it, but I'm not sure it's worth buying the DVD...
0060512806|5.0|A brilliantly complex book with descriptions so detailed I truly felt like I was 'there' -- seeing, hearing, tasting the scene.  I had to use sticky notes to keep track of the characters, but it was worth the effort.  It's a book about solving puzzles, and the book itself is a puzzle.  I'm reading it again, just for the joy of it.

0743243153|5.0|A book that is a real treasure for any human being, and for animals too if they could read. Certainly you will come across things that you already thought of yourself, but it never hurts to see your own intuitions \\"confirmed\\" by \\"specialists\\". I think this book should be mandatory, because everyone has, to some extent, psycho-material to heal and even if you're perfectly ok, there are people around you who may not be, and reading this book can be a first step in helping, others or yourself.    Peck provides lived examples of the things he put forward; it is very easy to understand and so it is accessible for anyone; you don't need to be learned in psychology or psychiatry at all.     If I had to make a list of 100 books I'd recommend you carry with you on an island, that one would be of them; and I truly think it should be some mandatory reading in schools and else.
0333726324|5.0|Not all my favorite authors are as good to listen to as they are on the page - but EYE OF THE NEEDLE, unabridged, is the perfect companion to a long trip (try Idaho to San Francisco). I tend to read too fast, and listening let me savor the impeccable period detail, the complex characterization, and the Swiss-watch plotting. As fans know, this story is Lady Chatterly's Lover meets John Le Carré. Even if you've read the book a couple of times, do yourself a favor and listen to the audio version.
0684830485|2.0|I found this book, which takes place during the Spanish Civil War, interesting in its descriptions and although it is excruciatingly slow in its development (five hundred pages detailing three days worth of events), somewhat compelling in its own way.    And yet in the end, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.    For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his?    Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists?    Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.    This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \\"Thee\\" and \\"Thou\\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me.    This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.    Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.

071563318X|5.0|This excellent guide will prepare you as well as any book can. The realities of an outbreak of the Solanum-infected is something that will test your physical and psychological limits. However--and with apologies to Mr. Brooks for using this space to editorialize--the only way we can fully prepare, is for the government to finally make the recorded incidents available for public scrutiny and analysis.     I know from bitter experience how ill-prepared local, state, and federal authorities are to deal with these outbreaks. It is only a matter of time before containment and cover-up are shown-up for the pathetic band-aid type responses they are; and we have a full-scale infestation that will have to be dealt with by the clueless.    The incident I experienced wasn't covered in the book, which is very surprising, considering how recent it was, the number of people involved, and the fact that it resulted in the death--among many others--of a former Cosby kid. At least a few of Mr. Brook's sources would surely have know about the events in and around Black Creek, Wisconsin in October of 1998.    My involvement began when I was pulled off the site of my security supervisor position at a nearby Department of Energy facility to support a county SWAT team dealing with a \\"civil disturbance\\". This type of order was unheard of, yet me and a few others with sniper training had to respond. This isn't the place for a long narrative, yet I need to give some sort of public account. Screw my security oath; I also took an oath to protect the United States from enemies foreign and domestic, and the only way to do that, I'm convinced, is to reveal the truth.     Long story as short as possible: a charter flight out of Canada went down in the dense woods surrounding the unincorporated town of Black Creek, and we were given vague instructions to set up a perimeter around that locus and stop, by whatever means necessary, anyone attempting to leave the area. We all thought it was a trainingexercise and were joking around when the first of \\"them\\" lurched out of the woods. You can guess what happened. Our perimeter soon became an inner perimeter as we ourselves were hemmed in, engaged in the fight of our lives. 18 horrifying and surreal hours later, huddled in an abandoned grist mill, the remains of our group were rescued by troops from Fort McCoy. The incident was covered up. Civilians as well as law enforcement and military personnel were threatened into silence, and I can only assume the press was as well. I am aware of some attempts at lawsuits still going on, but I think those are doomed to fail.    Had we had even a fraction of the knowledge contained in this guide--or even knew the nature of the enemy we battled--we would have fared so much better, and many good people would still be alive.     The advice in the book is solid, although I have a few thoughts of my own based on my experiences: I don't agree that edged weapons are superior to bludgeons. Blades will stick, splatter infected blood all over, and pose a greater risk to any of your allies in close proximity. You don't want the distraction of crawling around a dimly-lit floor, looking for your buddy's ear, accidently hacked off while you flailed at a horde of creatures. (True story.) Also, If you have the time in advance, use low-grain rounds in your firearms if you're planning on using them indoors. In an enclosed space, the muzzle-flash and noise from rounds like those in a magnum will leave you disoriented and numb after just a short time, severely limiting your combat effectiveness. Finally, wear pathogen-resistant boots. You won't believe the amount of blood that pools at your feet while defending a static position from a major onslaught.    Mentally toughen up. I realize that advice is a bit non-specific. I really don't have a solid indicator of what will make someone react better than others in those terrifying situations. Combat veterans panicked, with fatal consequences, while anintrepid band of Cub Scouts--clearly camped out at the wrong place at the wrong time--performed admirably.    Your Uncle Sam IS making small steps toward training its first responders, albeit secretively and obtusely. For example, see the 2005 copy of the FEMA Small Unit Managers Manual, 109-A. They mention \\"Transient Anomalous Social Disturbances\\". A roundabout and halfway approach to some sort of level of preparedness. And a close examination of the Department of Homeland Security charter will reveal small clues to a weak effort at defense against the undead. But, bottom line, it is the informed citizenry that will make the difference when the Solanum hits the fan. Get this book and get busy.

But like a lot of Ridley Scott's films, the darkness makes it great.  <br /> <br />The story is an easy one, but very entertaining: two cops capture a japanese criminal in New York and are orderd to take him back to Japan, where things get out of hand. The criminal, named Sato, escapes and Cops Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia are willing to do anything to get him back, although they are not welcome in the for them unknown Japan. <br /> <br />The casting is superb.  <br />Michael Douglas is perfect as the tough cop Nick, who shows that isn't the one to mess with. He acts convincing and was the right choice for the part.  <br />Andy Garcia steals the show as Charlie, Nick's partner. He knows how to bring the character of the \\"have a positive look on life\\" Charlie to life. <br />Then there is Kate Capshaw as Joyce, a woman in a club that helps them a hand. She is sexy and acts great. She plays her part convincing and strong.    <br /> <br />Although the movie has some great actionsequences, it is all about suspence. It is a great thriller that takes place in the perfect place to set a thriller: the dark underworld of Japan.  <br />The great thing about the film is that although the hard and cold darkness, it has some nice warm scenes of humor that give you a smile on your face.  <br /> <br />So if you are looking for a dark action thriller, you are looking at the right movie: Black Rain. <br />
B00005JOQS|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the first two Chris Reeve films were the first movies I ever saw as a little boy. They changed me. Superman and the films sculpted my entire childhood. 19 years later, we get to witness his return. And what a wonderful return. By now, you probably already know the details of the film. Superman comes back after 5 years, Lois Lane has moved on and has a kid and a fiancee, and Lex Luthor is plotting a new real estate scheme involving Superman. But really, how is the film itself?. Folks, I had a great time with this movie. It's big, it's breathtaking, and makes you happy. Superman is back, and we couldn't be happier. Brandon Routh is wonderful. I saw Chris Reeve in him early on, but it doesn't last long. He becomes Clark/Superman and makes it his own. Spacey is wonderful as Luthor. There is some humor there, but this is not Gene Hackman or Michael Rosenbaum. This Lex is nastier and deadlier. Bosworth does well, is beautiful, but doesn't have much beyond being hurt over Superman's disappearance and being the damsel in distress. Story wise, it's out there(at least the Lex part, but does one come to these films for intricate plots?. John Williams' theme and other familiar Superman scores pop up, and they really take you back and make this film soar. The effects are not only astonishing and visually stunning, but some are just breathtaking. The look of the film is beautiful and so well detailed and planned out. The movie is just superb looking. Some complain the film is too long, light on action, and moves slow. The movie is long, but this shouldn't be a problem to anyone. Light on action?. If you call the chilling and mesmerizing airplane sequence, roof top gun fire, earthquake, water rescue, and more and more light on action. Folks, this movie isn't light on anything. There are a number of homages to Richard Donner's film, and they will bring smiles to any true Superman fan. How about Lois' kid?. The boy is great. Just a normal boy who isn't forced to be cute or whatnot. A great kid and a great kid actor. There are a number of memorable moments here that aren't soon to be forgotten. The airplane sequence is incredible and the best sequence in any Superman movie. I could go on. Do I have complaints?. Very, very minor ones. I would've liked more scenes that were cut in Smallville(James Karen must be ticked)back in, and the last half seemed kind of dark. Like it was a \\"Batman\\" film or something. Basically, my gripes are meaningless to the greatness of the film. The movie is dedicated to the memory of Chris and Dana Reeve. Sadly, this comes after the end credits when it should of come before, when more people would see it. Noel Neill and Jack Larson are along for the ride as well. And what a ride. Superman Returns is filled with wonderful humor, real, genuine heart and emotion, wonderful set pieces and score and imagery. This is one summer blockbuster that justifies the term. Go see it, and await anxiously for Superman's next big return.

B00005JP0A|4.0|The Devil Wears Prada is one of the best comedies and funniest fashion themed films in recent years. I found it totally entertaining and enjoyed every minute of Meryl Streep's wicked and devilish rendition of Miranda Priestley. She managed to make the most of lesser screentime and chews up every scene effortlessly. She's so good at her expressions and body language that she upstaged everyone else in the group scenes. Her character is totally unlikeable, because she's heartless, cold, ruthless, but her performance makes it so delightful. It's unfortunate that Anne Hathaway's unfashionable Andie role took up most of the screentime. Her scenes with the boyfriend and friends really took away from the focus of the film. I wanted to see more of her opposite Streep, and how she worked around the Devil. Yes, I did find the scenes of Miranda's nasty treatments towards Andie became too repetitious, but it was pretty much the funniest moments of the film. It's obvious that Hathaway's performance is not as impressive as Streep and the scene stealing Stanley Tucci who helps her to transform from an ugly duckling into a fashion chick. Emily Blunt who plays Miranda's first assistant gets to have some funny moments to work with. I couldn't stop thinking that she looks so much like Cilian Murphy in Breakfast in Pluto. Overall, the film is very stimulating comedy with lots of high fashion moments, not to mention that they got all the top designer wardrobe for the cast especially Streep who had the most lavish wardrobe changes. Even Valentino made a cameo apperance! I must say that Patricia Field did a marvellous job with the costume, even the \\"stuff\\" she put together for Andie looks so hideous that it was perfect. I won't be surprised if Streep and Field will receive an Oscar nomination for their memorable works come 2007.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|ok, you can either love or hate deep impact. for me, i am one of them who loves deep impact. unlike most disaster flicks this one really focuses on the human side of the story but still boast some impressive special effects. the premisis of the story goes like this. two teens discover something in the sky one night and unsure what it is decide to report it. a year goes by and a reporter gets wind of a person named \\"ellie\\" and tries to dig it up. then the president makes an announcment that the object the two teens discovered is actually a giant meteor on a crash course to earth that will decimate all of humanity. now as the world prepares for the coming threat, the all star cast must now mend there lives before its too late. this is were it gets me as each story is so heartbreaking and the premisis so dire. by far the best scene in the film is when the reporter and her father both forgive each other just before the comet hits and a title wave comes right at them. by far the best disaster movie, a big recomend.
B000683VI4|5.0|Hands down, this is the best romantic movie ever! Definitly one to keep...it will be a classic one day.
0740748475|5.0|A must have for a true Calvin & Hobbes fan. All comics together in 3 hardcover books. The comics are printed on top-quality paper. Only downside is perhaps that the books are a little heavy and unwieldy when reading compared to the normal thinner Calvin & Hobbes books.
B00004YA66|5.0|I first saw this movie in the movie theater, at a time when I was just beginning to stop going to the theater for every new release, and opting instead, to wait for the DVD release.  But, I had received some Gift Card Movie Tickets, and I couldn't pass this one up.  It was really good!<br /><br />The thing I loved about this movie compared to other time travel movies, is it allowed different time segments to cross and interfere with each other (sort of like Back to the Future, when Marty's current self was interfering with his past self) etc.  I like seeing the interaction between father and son, both past and present.  It was really entertaining.<br /><br />Of course we all want a good ending, which this movie has, but the director/writer didn't sacrafice a good story, with lots of loose ends, to accomplish it.  And that's what makes it a good DVD worth repeat viewings  After all, don't you hate when you re-watch an old favorite, only to find its full of holes and open endings  That's very frustrating for somebody like me, who watches the same movie multiple times.<br /><br />Great in the theater, and on DVD!  This movie is terrific!!!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!  5 Stars!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|Fabulous!! I like every song and love most of them! If you like Coldplay, you will love this.
0312995423|3.0|This book moves fast and provides plenty of action to keep you turning the pages.  The only problem I found with this book is that there were too many \\"cheesy\\" moments for my liking.  Romance is cool but \\"cheesy\\" romance is inexcusable.   <br /> <br />The relationship between Susan and David is very sophomoric and tiring.  Whenever Susan gets stressed over the slightest bit of tension she whines on about missing David or worrying about how he's doing.  He returns the favor by mulling over how much he misses her while on temporary assignment in Spain.  It just seems odd that Susan happens to be the number two cryptographer for the NSA while acting like a number one wimp too head-over-heals in love to focus on what should be her highest priority:  figure out what's going on in TRANSLTR.  I wish Mr. Brown had made both characters a little tougher - grittier. <br /> <br />While the book reads a lot like a made-for-TV movie you might find yourself watching on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon on one of your local independent television stations, it is still a bit fun.  I think Dan Brown whipped this book out in very little time.  It was not as compelling as Deception Point.   <br /> <br />Digital Fortress is a fun, quick read but best left for a quick flight from say Dallas to Los Angeles.  That's about all the time you will need to figure out the plot. <br />

B000FFJ85I|5.0|I'm not an idiot and I know everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but some of these negative reviews are just pathetic. Writing a bunch of nonsense about how AFI aren't 'punk' anymore is ridiculous. Yes, they have changed over the years, and I think for the better. After all, hearing men in their 30's sing about cutting off their testicles to join a women's bowling team is ridiculous. They have grown up and have matured. Some fans actually like that fact. <br /> <br />Now, for Decemberunderground. When I first listened to it wasn't my all-time favorite. A few tracks stuck with me, but nothing too special. I listened to it again, though, and gradually the songs I wasn't super into sort of grew on me. Now having listened to it several times, I can safely say that I adore the album. For a couple of weeks it was the only CD that I played. This album also reminded me how much I truly love AFI. Not many bands change their style and hope their fans accept whatever direction they decide to go in. Labeling them and saying they 'suck' is silly. Again, we all have our opinions, but being babies about it won't get you anywhere. <br /> <br />Now, because I can and I feel like it, I will list my opinions of each song. <br /> <br />1) \\"Prelude 12/21\\" -- Catchy intro, though they always manage to start their albums wonderfully. This was originally one of my favorite songs on the album, and I still love it.  <br /> <br />2) \\"Kill Caustic\\" -- When I first heard it I hated the song. From some of the reviews, though, it seems I'm not the only one. Hell, I even resorted to skipping it several times. At last, though, I made myself listen to it a few more times. Despite how crazy it is, I think the chorus is nice. <br /> <br />3) \\"Miss Murder\\" -- The hit single... I like the song, though it got sort of old rather fast. Not my favorite, but it's not unbearable to listen to. I love the bass intro, too. <br /> <br />4) \\"Summer Shudder\\" -- Hands down my favorite song. The beginningseems a bit bland, but when the chorus comes in, it blew me away. It reminds me of \\"Ever and a Day\\" in some aspects. Beautiful, beautiful song. <br /> <br />5) \\"The Interview\\" -- Again, another song where I'm fond of the chorus. Also, the best part of this track is the duet with Davey&&Jade at the end. I've always been fond of Jade's voice, so I was very excited at hearing such a lovely duet. <br /> <br />6) \\"Love Like Winter\\" -- It reminds me of a lot of 80's music, which isn't a bad thing at all since I love music from that time period. It's very catchy and I always find myself wanting to dance or something... <br /> <br />7) \\"Affliction\\" -- It's a bit manic, like \\"Kill Caustic\\" in some ways, but not horrible. I especially love the parts where it slows down a little. <br /> <br />8) \\"The Missing Frame\\" -- Not my favorite track on the album... not even close. I don't hate it, but it just doesn't catch my interest all that much. <br /> <br />9) \\"Kiss and Control\\" -- Another great song. At first it wasn't my favorite, but again, it grew on me.  <br /> <br />10) \\"The Killing Lights\\" -- I love Davey's voice in this song. Not a typical 'AFI sound' but I like it, anyway. This is one of the catchiest songs on the CD, I think. <br /> <br />11) \\"37mm\\" -- Just... wonderful. Another brilliant AFI song. <br /> <br />12) \\"Endlessly, She Said\\" -- The prettiest song on the entire album. It's so soft and sad, and yet so beautiful. It is easily one of my very favorite songs on Decemberunderground. <br /> <br />And, before I get labeled as a 12-year-old `gawth' girl who is in love with Davey, just know you're wrong. I may be a newer fan, having been first introduced to AFI with Sing the Sorrow, but I'm not someone who likes them because they're the latest trend. Over the years I have become a bigger fan of theirs, and though I don't claim to be the all-time biggest fan, I do pride myself on being able to listen to and enjoy every album they have come up with. Each one is quite different, yet still very good. I only wish those who claim to be `huge, devoted' AFI fans would be able to respect all they do, for if Davey, Adam, Jade and Hunter are pleased with this album, I don't see what all the fuss is about. And that is all I have to say about that. Feel free to pick apart all I've said, but all I know is that I love AFI and I plan on being a fan for quite some time. The end.
B000063JDE|2.0|Let it first be said that everyone who considers themselves a serious student of film should see \\"Blue Velvet\\" on principle alone-- this review is intended for people who have seen it, and thus contains SPOILERS.    David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\" is that rare breed of film: an unquestioned modern masterpiece, upheld by imdb geeks and Entertainment Weekly-pop culture hounds as something truly special. Everybody seems to like it, and everybody's got their own reason. Some see it as allegory, some simply as a living nightmare, some as genuinely effective drama, some as a coming-of-age story.    I've seen \\"Blue Velvet\\" three times now. The first time, I admit a prejudicial point of view-- I wanted to prove Roger Ebert right in his criticism of it, because Ebert was my hero at the time. I was unimpressed. Later, I returned to it after a number of critics upheld it as the genuine article. I'd seen Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, and loved both of them-- perhaps I was more prepared for Lynchian weirdness this time around. Nope. I was still unimpressed, although I was entranced by the visual look of the film.    Recently, I found myself picking it up again, after seeing Mulholland Drive with an artsy group of friends who were convinced that they could explain everything that happened in it to me, and pretty much did (except for the blue box and the scene with the huge dude who knocks out the   director's wife). With an increased appreciation of Lynch, I returned to what most consider his masterpiece, ironically enough, prejudiced IN ITS FAVOR this time around.     Well, I'm still not impressed. \\"Blue Velvet\\" thinks it's so damn cool and subversive. It thinks it's turning Americana on its head by depicting sexual perversion behind white picket fences. I don't think it's doing anything at all.    Granted, for forty minutes or so, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is compelling. From the opening scene to the discovery of the ear all the way up to  Dennis Hopper's unforgettable apperance and including the dream sequence afterwards, Lynch had me hooked. He seemed at that point to be ready to go for broke, to show us unimaginable horrors, to penetrate through to the darkest aspects of human nature.    Yet something odd happens after the forty minute mark-- the story that we thought was gradually unfolding into something complex and sinister stops unfolding altogether. After forty minutes, we have all the plot we're going to get. We have a woman held in sexual slavery by a drug dealer who has kidnapped her husband and son, we have the naive college kid who tries to help her out, we have the sweet high school girl he's falling in love with, and that's all we have. Those expecting \\"Blue Velvet\\" to \\"go somewhere\\" from this point will be sorely disappointed.     In the end, \\"Blue Velvet\\" goes down an entirely conventional path towards its conclusion. Instead of exploring the Hopper character, Lynch makes him into a campy villain. Instead of exploring the Rosellini character, Lynch makes her into a conventional damsel in distress, longing after her husband and son. Instead of exploring the MacLachlan character, Lynch turns him into an uninteresting do-gooder. The latter choice is particularly odd, given that Lynch has set him up to have his whole world turned upside-down-- yet he heroically takes everything in stride and saves the day.    Most egregious of all is the resolution of the plot, which I've got to assume is intended as a joke on the viewer. After all of Lynch's pretensions about inverting Americana, he gives us a reaffirmation of it, in the form of a conventional ending in which a simple act of violence   restores the natural order of things, the robins make everything better, and, gee, everything's just great! Even though I'm sure this is intended as ironic, I found myself frustrated anyway. If Lynch isn't going to take his art seriously, why should the viewer?    I don't want to seem like I'm making an attack on Lynch, although it may seem that way, asI'm criticizing his most canonized work. Lynch has proven that he is capable of taking himself seriously, and developing stories that go places-- even if they work with a logic that conventional films do not. \\"Blue Velvet,\\" by contrast, goes nowhere and does nothing truly unusual or interesting in the process. I've endeavored to work my way around to enjoying it, but I can't. It simply is not interesting, as a dramatic work, or even as an abstract collection of images.     I would direct those who want to see Lynch at his best to \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,\\" \\"Lost Highway\\" (my personal favorite), and, in a more conventional vein (well, relatively speaking), \\"Wild at Heart.\\" These are virtuoso films that see the director exploiting the most fearsome resources of cinema to lead his viewers on journeys that begin and end, with point and purpose. They are masterpieces, and no matter what anyone tells you, they make sense if you are willing to do the intellectual heavy-lifting.     Compared to these later works, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is positively forgettable.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not \\"fun,\\" but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster.

And I HATE that studios are greedy and save the good extras so they can persuade you into buying a 2nd one.  But they've done it again-this version is a real improvement over the first DVD.  So if you've got some extra cash, and this movie sends you into fits of laughter (as it did me)-buy this edition.  And throw your old one at a studio executive's head.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|I'll keep it short, since as of this writing there are 335 other reviews, mostly raving about this CD.  The title of the review says it all; do not attempt to operate machinery while listening to this album.  Not a single track is designed to keep you awake long enough to listen to the next track.  What's unfortunate for me is that, while so many 70s rockers are now writing and recording funeral dirges, I still like to keep my blood flowing.  Expect NOTHING like Floyd; then curl up with some soft food, a warm bed, and this CD.  Do not, however, expect to be conscious by the last song.

B000BVD460|5.0|To all the Eminem fans out there this is an absolute must own. Well you can't really go wrong when you take all of Em's hits and make a CD can you? I recommend that if you get this you get the one with bonus Stan's Mixtape. It has some songs from Eminem's mixtapes and non famous one's from Eminem's albums. I would not say this album is missing tracks because it's a CD of the hits from his solo albums so they did not decide to put in songs like Purple Pills and My Band.    Also got three new tracks Fack, Shake That feat. Nate Dogg, The new single When I'm Gone and Stan feat. Elton John (Live)    If you don't have this album go get it now.
B000063UR2|2.0|In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.  To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs?  That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend.  Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together.  I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade.  I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes.  It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs.  What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures.  We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top \\"Price of Darkness\\" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.<br /><br />Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling \\"bang\\".  We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light.  Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esque creatures.  Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively).  Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait.  With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait.  The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us.  Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film.  While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping.  I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film.  This hurt Legend.  Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet.  With Legend, I never felt that.  I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination.  I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.<br /><br />I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous \\"director's cut\\") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie.  Scott had some (I stress \\"some\\") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions.  What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters.  In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters.  Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of \\"anyone-itis\\".  Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask.  Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone?  Follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more clich&eacute; than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend.  I wanted to like this film.  I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.<br /><br /> Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film.  I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a \\"direct to video\\" release.  Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed.  Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting.  Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together.  During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect.  Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece.  From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****the film, it is another case of \\"anyone-itis\\".

My favourite famous song would have to be Trapped where he talks about jail etc however Brenda's Got A Baby and If My Homie Calls are amazing songs with great beats etc. In the non famous song's Soulja's Story has to be my favourite with his soulja voice and great beats. Other great songs are Young Black Male, I Don't Give A F***, Violent, Words Of Wisdom, Something Wicked, Rebel Of The Underground and Part Time Mutha.  <br /> <br />This is a good album to get to start your Tupac collection, listen to Tupac when he started in the rap scene. You will not be dissapointed!
B00005JOQS|5.0|Batman Begins saved the Batman franchise, Superman Returns does the  <br /> <br />same for the Superman franchise.  It is not as good as Begins or  <br /> <br />the Spiderman series but it still is a very good movie.  The  <br /> <br />effects were great and the acting was great in some cases(Brandon  <br /> <br />Routh, Parker Posey) and bad in others.(Kevin Spacey, Kate  <br /> <br />Bosworth)  I like Spacey as Lex Luthor but I don't like how he  <br /> <br />portrayed him.  Gene Hackman had fun with the role Spacey just  <br /> <br />made him a big jerk.  Bosworth was um nevermind.  The only other  <br /> <br />problem with the movie is that it is a bit too long and there is  <br /> <br />not enough action. <br />     <br />    Overall though an enjoyable movie, hopefully the sequel has  <br /> <br />even more action.
B0007GAERG|4.0|MARIAH CAREY IS ON A ROLL AND THIS CD KEEPS IT GOING. I HAVE THE CD AND I HAVE TO SAY I LIKE MOST OF THE SONGS. SOME OF THE BALLADS ARE BORING BUT ALL IN ALL THIS IS WORTH BUYING
B00012BSHG|5.0|It is a great pool we are thinking about buying a second one to fill with balls and let the kids jump around. The padding on the bottom is so comfortable and much better than having it sit on a hard floor or ground. Also the clear sides are great for you to see in or them to look out.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Each time I listen to this album, I'm left speechless. Every single selection is so carefully crafted, and no matter how unconventional, the entire album has matchless originality, sincerity, and musical integrity.  It is really unlike anything I've ever heard. <br /> <br />I feel like Sufjan is directly communicating with the listener throughout every song.  He has pushed me to research almost every aspect of the state of Illinois throughout the CD.  His incorporation of both personal and historical elements is masterful.  For example, the content matter of \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" seems to have nothing to do the title holiday unique to Illinois, until I noticed one of the last lines of the song, where he discreetly references remembering his lost friend \\"on the holiday\\".  But he makes that subtle reference the title of his song, and it is nothing but appropriate.  And \\"They Are Night Zombies!! . . .\\"  seems like the most bizarre, far-out, self-indulgent piece of music, and it is, but it mentions a huge range of cities in the title state throughout the song, as well as some goosebump-worthy lyrics of a man speculating about death. <br /> <br />The instrumental songs somehow also incorporate the same elements as the songs with lyrics.  How could I bring myself to skip over \\"A Short Reprise for Mary Todd. . .\\", a tribute to Lincoln's wife, when the chords just hauntingly melt into one another? <br /> <br />Sufjan Stevens' uses a very effective minimalist approach, where he spells out a simple if unusual musical theme as many times as he can with appropriate variations within each song.  Therefore, his music feels comfortable and appropriate to the listener.  I have never heard another artist so capable both technically and musically.  I hope that every one who listens to this album can feel what I feel, because no album that I have ever listened to has spoken to me like this album has.
0451526384|4.0|I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite).  This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.   <br /> <br />Let's begin with a summary.  Anne Elliot fears life as an \\"old maid\\" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married.  She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth.  At the time, he was not considered suitable.  Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect.  Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth.  Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her.  Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him.  The question now is does he feel the same way?  This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.   <br /> <br />I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons.  First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man.  Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character.  Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics.  However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them.  I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time.  She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves.  She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us.  I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways.  Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.   <br /> <br />Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way?  Austen was an early psychologistof her time and really understands human behavior.  I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself.  It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem.  I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.   <br /> <br />Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time.  Enjoy! <br />
B000000WCA|5.0|All the songs in this album are just incredible. It's very diverse, featuring ballads, dance, songs with \\"robotic\\" vocals, and it includes the all time favorite ballad \\"2 Become 1\\"...What can I say? If you like pop, this is definitely for you! Go ahead and buy it!
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|First of all, let me state that I am not overly critical of movies. I have loved movies that were deemed terrible by critics and viewers. I loved Aeon Flux. So, I thought that I would give this film a try. It seemed like something that would be right up my alley... vampire, sci-fi, ect. I'm sure you get the point. But this film bored me. The characters seemed to me to be very unconvincing. This is especially true of Violet. I think they took the whole maternal thing a little too far. The story seemed to be a bit redundant. When you watch it, it feels like something you've seen before because it follows a pretty standard storyline. I'll admit, it does have some aspects that are used to try to differentiate it from other such films, but it just doesn't work. Even the action seems somewhat... I'm not sure what the word for it is exactly, but it's disappointing. I would have expected better. Some of the action scenes do redeem themselves though. I also didn't like the random bit of technology that kept changing Violet's costume. It seemed completely unnecessary and, honestly, annoyed the hell out of me. Another thing that they didn't do is explain things as fully as they could have. The movie isn't even an hour and a half. It wouldn't have killed them to explain more things in detail. They do cover some bases- the essential ones- but they leave viewers in the dark about many other things. If this film didn't manage to capture and keep my interest, I think more critical viewers would have a much more difficult time finding enjoyment in it. Maybe there was something I was missing.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I wa supset that theres only 8 episodes for season 5 but with the real life pregnecies of 2 of the actress it had to be cut short. Overall not the best season but it's still enjoyable. Not much happens in this forgetable season as the lady just more whine then they do have fun. But it's irrestable not to laugh at the charactors and it'smposiable not to love. Wee see Carrie's carror take off, Samantha learns what love is and the aftermath of a breakup, Charlette tries to be fun but her charactor gets lost in the other charactors, and Meranda deals with being a mother.
014305760X|4.0|This book resonated with me primarily because of the character Jess, the 18-year-old member of the group. She, unfortunately, reminded me of my daughter. On the good side, her comments and ruminations actually gave me a better understanding of why my daughter behaves the way she does. This statement from Jess is particularly telling: <br /> <br />\\"I suffer from a failure of imagination. I could do what I wanted, every day of my life, and what I want to do, apparently, is to get walloped out of my head and pick fights. Telling me I can do anything I want is like pulling the plug out of the bath and then telling the water it can go anywhere it wants. Try it, and see what happens.\\"
0812550706|5.0|Imagine this:<br /><br />You're a child. The school bully has it for you no matter how many non-violent ways you avoid him or attempt to weaken or discourage him. When he comes for you, he comes for you hard. You get damaged. One day, he's really mad and gunning for you. You sense in every cell that this will be the day you will be badly broken or die. He's not just gonna hit you once. He's got a gang and he's gonna pound you to a bloody, maybe unbreathing, pulp.<br /><br />  What do you do?<br /><br />Imagine that adults are of no use in this situation. You can't call the principal or the security guard or your parents or the cops.<br /><br />You're alone, facing brutes who will happily turn you into human compost.<br /><br />  What do you do?<br /><br />How much action does \\"surviving\\" justify?<br /><br />Depending on how you answer this, you may or may not like or love or respect the classic, best-selling, rivetting, page-turner that is ENDER'S GAME, winner of both the Hugo and Nebula. (The sequel won both as well.)<br /><br />ENDER'S GAME is one of the most accessible of sci-fi classics. The straight-forward prose rises to something higher and magical only in spots, but its page-turning plot and rivetting boy-hero keep you reading. Card created a highly-sympathetic character in a horrible situation to which we, nevertheless, become addicted spectators.<br /><br />It's not a novel that makes you stop and admire the prose, although I did go back, later, and see how he made me feel so strongly in some parts with such unvarnished writing. The storytelling skill and the narrative drive are such that if you aren't kept up into the wee hours, desperate to finish, something's not wrong with the story. It's wrong with you.<br /><br />Yes, there you have it. You. Not the novel.<br /><br />And I'm only half-kidding.<br /><br />So, back to the bully question. How do you answer?<br /><br />It's the question Ender Wiggin, our protagonist, must answer from the moment he's able to think and act. He is an extraordinary boy, six years old and so smart it brings him to the attention of the government, the same government that tested his elder siblings, his sister and brother, who are also remarkably gifted. Ender's life is a torment. His parents are ineffectual. His brother is a monster. His sister loves him, and mitigates some of his suffering, but she cannot guarantee he will not be killed. When Ender is approached to attend Battle School--effectively cutting him off from everyone in his family and on earth for years to come--the boy accepts. It is the way to save his own life.<br /><br />And the crux of the novel: What does one do when bullies threaten one's life. . . and the lives of one's family?<br /><br />  What would you do?<br /><br />Ender is faced with bullies in the home, in school on Earth, and then in Battle School in space, and then beyond, in Command School, and then at last in a place where the biggest, scariest enemy isn't human, but an ant-like creature termed a \\"Bugger.\\"<br /><br />What does one do to survive? How do we train the people who fight our biggest battles?<br /><br />And is it morality correct to train people THIS way, and to fight THAT way?<br /><br />I'm not usually big on militaristic novels. Battle strategy, fight after fight--that tends to bore me. In this case, I was eager for the next mock encounter. The zero-G battles between the \\"armies\\" of boys (and one girl) are exhilirating. And I was even eager for the next real confrontation between the bullies and Ender, because Ender is no ordinary boy and following his mental and emotional processing of his surroundings and options, and how he reaches his ultimate choices, is mesmerizing.<br /><br />Ultimate choices. It must come to that.<br /><br />I hear that the book is studied in some places specifically for the psychological insights into leadership. I'm not surprised.<br /><br />ENDER'S GAME has one of the most sublime endings of any novel I've read in this genre. It's powerful and mystical and dark and hopeful. I wept.<br /><br />But to get the pay-off of that beautiful ending, you've gotta live through what Ender lives through, and fear what he fears, and then know what he knows.<br /><br />I recommend this journey highly for any reader, even those not usually drawn to speculative fiction, even those (like me) who avoid child protagonists.<br /><br />If you're a writer who struggles with less than poetic sentences, you can learn from this how the power of a cracking good story brings magic to prose lacking in literary \\"artistic\\" levels and finesse. Card's prose gets out of the way of Ender's struggle, so that you can remain focused on the boy and his journey. And it works.<br /><br />Mir<br />of MIRATHON blog<br />Asst.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best TV show I've ever seen. You feel with the characters and laugh with them. They just exude energy and love for the show. I feel Mal's love for his crew and know why Simon sacrifices everything for his Sister. <br /> <br />You owe it to yourself to go watch Firefly.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|As a kid, I saw this movie and I remember that it had a big effect on me. The scene where all the gangs are going to the big meeting is one of my most memorable movie memories.     While watched it then I was thinking that its from an ancient Greek story. I was pleased now when I saw the comic introduction that I was right.     What this movie proves that to make a really good movie, you don't need a massive budget and big name actors. They help but they are not necessary. The story, acting, directing, music, filming etc etc etc are all first rate.     A warning if you don't like these surreal comic type movies, you will not like it as its certainly not a realistic story. Also I wish that they had included the original theatrical release on this DVD as I thought that it was better then this version.     Like so many really good movies, the memory of the picture remains long after you have seen it. This film is a classic.
B000062X90|5.0|I remember hearing of this band when I was just a lad, but I never owned any of their albums, and none of my closest friends played this for me, so this is a great discovery for me. I'm only on my second listen, but it's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite. It's from my favorite rock period, the early seventies, and it's not only nicely remastered, it's also remixed, meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks, not the stereo master. I wish more reissues were done this way.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|I hate punk. Let's get that clear from the start. <br /> <br />That said, this is not exactly punk, to my ears. There is far and away much more musicality going on here than in punk music I am used to hearing. <br /> <br />I like the record's political leanings, but for someone who is more into 'groove-based' music, a lot of \\"London Calling\\" is not really my style. <br /> <br />There are several songs I really enjoy, however, starting with the title track. \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" is a nice slice of mutant-reggae, and my favorite, \\"Guns of Brixton\\" has been described perfectly elsewhere as \\"a dread-sick skank,\\" which also satisfies my reggae jones. <br /> <br />Someone once described The Clash to me as 'punk-meets-reggae.' My thought is that there was too much punk and not enough reggae.  <br /> <br />It's certainly worth multiple listens, however.
B0009K7QZ8|2.0|Overall I found the season to be a big bore. I am not a hugh fan and season 1 was pretty good but not great but I had to watch this season and will continue to watch the other season's. The season started good but went downhill fast becouse nothing happend you can miss all season adn it will be right were you left off. There are good moments like the last few episodes were really good. Overall not a great second season.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|This movie definitely has a cult-B movie quality about it.  Therefore, I suppose it is safe to say that this film isn't for everyone.  However, I am not sure why people are so appalled by this movie.  The center of the story revolves around a rape and the aftermath of that event.  I also realize rape is one of the most disgusting acts that could transpire between two human beings.  With this taken into consideration, we as a society shouldn't watch this a pure entertainment, correct?  Well if that is the case we as a fellowship should wipe out viewing 90% television and motion pictures.  Reason being is that murder is a pretty nasty act, next to rape.  However, how many movies as \\"entertainment\\" do western civilization watch that includes murder and/or killing people?  Lethal Weapon (any part), XXX, Pulp Fiction, Face Off, Blade, Die Hard, Scarface, Desperado, Matrix, Bad Boys, should I keep going?<br /><br />I haven't even listed horror films, but let us think of twisted ways to kill other people.  Then the killer(s) can be dressed in really cool Halloween costumes and have multiple sequels.  Finally, we go to the theater and get seats for a showing that fits our capitalistic schedule, while eat over priced popcorn!  Isn't that the entire point of a horror movie and going to see one?  Well how about to sell it to the masses we remove all the blood, then we can make it PG-13!!!<br /><br />A perfect example of a movie with plenty of violence and killing is \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\".  This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but that aside, watch the last action scene of this movie.  Branglina must have killed a hundred people, but there wasn't any blood.  This makes it alright for a PG-13 rating; therefore it is alright to send our youth to watch this movie.  So if you want to say \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" is a terrible movie and is tasteless, fine.  However, you better close theaters for blockbuster summer movies and/or cancel many televisions programs, because violence is everywhere, regardless if it is sexual driven or not.<br /><br />As for \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" itself, does the movie have the greatest story line? No.  Is the acting unbelievable and amazing? No.  Will it win any awards? No.  However, all the aspects of the movie give it an element that is mesmerizing.  Now this movie is about a brutal rape, but that isn't all it's about.  One should wear the sign \\"Myopic\\" if they think this movie is only about rape.  It is about a rape and its aftermath.  How the character Jennifer reacts and deals with it.  I know I stated prior that the acting in this movie isn't unbelievable and amazing.  However, Camille Keaton (who sort of has this Fiona Apple quality about her) does a pretty good job in the movie.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, ELITE ENTERTAINMENT did a great job in restoring the picture and sound.  However, I don't know why this movie was remastered in THX.  There is no major sound effects or really any music.  I suppose any conduit to George Lucas and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a good one.  There is also an audio commentary track with Joe Bob Riggs, which is very insightful.  As for the genre, I wouldn't list this as a horror movie at all.  I would consider it more a drama.  Nevertheless, the bathtub scene still makes my skin crawl.  Right fellas?<br /><br />In conclusion, I am not a person who is inclined to forgive a rapist or am one of these people that are turned on by sadistic acts such as rape.  I enjoy this movie because it is edgy; not your normal cookie cutter movie of today.  This type of motion picture wouldn't be made today; I suppose it is that postmodern John Calvin attitude that is bleeding over into media.  As for movies about rape, I want to remind everyone that there was a movie about rape that allowed Jodie Foster to win an academy award.ecause violence is everywhere, regardless if it is sexual driven or not.<br /><br />As for \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" itself, does the movie have the greatest story line?

I HAD HER CD BEFOREHAND WHICH I LOVE...SHE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED ARTISTS AROUND TODAY.  MY  HUSBAND IS A MUSIC EDITOR SO I HEAR THEM ALL!  ANYWAYS, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS ALBUM AND IF YOU GET THE CHANCE, MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT TO SEE HER WHEN SHE COMES TO YOUR TOWN.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  SHE IS CHARISMATIC, SOULFUL, BEAUTIFUL AND OH SO TALENTED.  I LIKED HER ALBUM MORE AFTER I SAW HER, WHICH I DID NOT THINK WAS POSSIBLE.  THERE'S A CD IN MY CAR, IN MY COMPUTER AND IN MY COMPUTER AT WORK.  I'VE BOUGHT CDS FOR ALL MY FRIENDS...THAT'S HOW GOOD IT  <br />IS!  YOU GO CORINNE  !!!!!...I'LL SEE YOU AT THE ROXY IN JULY!!!!

0786838655|5.0|Percy Jackson has been kicked out of 6 schools in 6 years. He is diagnosed with ADHD, he has an abusive stepfather, and a mother who is supportive. He discovers that he is a half-blood--son of a mortal mother and a Greek god. The adventures are fast and furious. Percy must go on a heroes quest to stop the gods from a war that will destroy western civilization. A sixth grade student of mine recommended the book and I'm so glad he did. Riordan incorporates Greek mythology into a modern day setting and immediately the reader is caught up into Percy's quest. Can't wait to read the second book in the series.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It seems as though it was yesterday, but it was actually 5 years ago, the day that I first discovered John Mayer. It was in the summer of 2001, just before the forth of July, months before the release of this album. I stumbled upon Johns work somewhere online, and found a true talent, yet to have been formally introduced to the world. At first it was just the acoustic version of John, it was so raw and yet so beautiful, it was something that I had never heard before, and I loved it! I burned the CD and went bragging to friends, playing it at every chance I got. The reaction the CD received from nearly all of my friends? Awful, they actually hated it, especially the girls. Inside I was actually angry, the music that I had just picked out of obscurity being bashed by everyone. Then it came, the day I had been waiting for, the John Mayer coming out party. The music video for Real World was released. People were starting to understand. I was no longer alone in my passion about John Mayer. Fast forward exactly 5 years from the date of my personal John Mayer discovery and here I am as big of fan as ever. This CD is something that I will never forget.<br /><br />This CD is one of the few that come around that are truly amazing, one that can be listened to many years after its original release date. Of the tracks on the CD I do have a few that I believe stand a cut above the rest. The tracks that I most admire on this album are (in no particular order): Your Body is a Wonderland, Back to You, My Stupid Mouth, Why Georgia, and No Such Thing. Those are what I consider the top 5 songs on the CD, but the entire albm is excellent. This is by far the better of the two albums that John Mayer has released and would recommend this over `Heavier Things' any day of the week.<br /><br />Brian Bowen
0767830555|2.0|Not that Crime and Punishment was happy but the film and the book are undeniably similar. From the isolation felt by the protagonists, to the heroic child prostitutes.  <br /> The film is compelling there is no doubt of that but is that a good thing? With a book like Crime and Punishment where the character murders, the author at least shows the consequences of such a deed both inwardly and in the world. <br /> With Taxi Driver the climax is the violence, it is the insanity. An insane man saying 'you talking to me' is cool and funny. Travis is the hero, an insane man who murders and tries to assasinate people is looked up to and idolized. Thats a hallmark of Scorcese films and why I dont like a lot of his work. He shows the seductiveness and romanticism of satanic actions and people, but brings too much sympathy to them, too much idolization. Instead of showing the real consequences of these dark impulses, Scorsese seems to be infatuated with them and splashes them pornographically across the screen for his own amusement. <br /> This film is seductive yes, but certainly unhealthy.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|For those who (like myself) were disappointed/outraged by the remixing that was done to this fine album when the box set was released some years ago, all is now well. This is the original mix in all it's basic and straight-on splendor. This is the album that \\"made\\" ZZ Top, and rightfully so. With classics like \\"Waiting For The Bus\\", \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\", \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\", \\"La Grange\\" - hell, the entire album, if you buy only one ZZ TOp album, this is the one to get. If you only know the MTV-era ZZ Top, then this will show you what they were really about before they descended into self-parody. This is raw and real.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is a classic science fiction movie that contains an excellent plot and the special effects are still \\"reasonably\\" good even with todays capabilities.
B00005JOQS|4.0|SUPERMAN is back and its good to see him.  ROUTH is very appealing and has the look of our hero.  all the others:  LANGELLA, BOSWORTH and SPACEY are well cast.  story: new continent made from crystals and kryptonite with LUTHOR owning the new land and SUPERMAN returns from searching for planet KRYPTON.  STARTLING state of the art special effects(basically the plane sequence)--the rest are ok and you can tell the minatures in many of the scenes.  ROUTH showed his emotions well with likeable subtle nuances.  the length of the movie is a whopping 2hrs and 34 mins.  I love getting more bang/movie for the dollar but longer is not always better--they could have shaved a few mins here and there.  really nice interplay between lois and clark/SUPERMAN and it does make you like them even more.  LANGELLA and SPACEY do their best(SPACEY alittle more) in roles but I would have liked LUTHOR be aweebit more evil.  for some reason I really enjoyed SAM HUNTINGTON as JIMMY OLSON(his giddy innocence) and EVA MARIE SAINT as MARTHA KENT(his caring mum)---their roles were not significant, however-memorable at least to me.  you could tell alot from their role playing that they captured the essence of who they were.  lois has a child?-----is it with her husband or with SUPERMAN the twist is nice and you do wonder at times.  so, with all things said:  GOOD SHOW - go see it at IMAX theatre in your area.  this was a very good movie and all fans should go right out and see it.  I bought into it and can't wait for his RETURN again.  ps, even though we all saw this coming--in the credits they dedicated the movie to CHRISTOPHER REEVE and his wife DANA REEVES both who have recently passed on.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I got tired of watching the repeats on tv so I bought the complete series and boy am I glad I did. I didn't realize how much of the show's character gets lost when it's edited for regular tv. It's such a great series and now I can watch it any time I want!! This is a must have for any fan of Sex and the City!
B00000FZ1V|5.0|It is a commonly accepted truism that when one returns as an adult to a book or film one loved as a child, the book or film proves to be a very different work from that which one remembered.  One usually finds that the story one fell in love with as a child is significantly less funny, exciting or appealing than it was back then. <br /> <br />\\"Ghostbusters\\", which I recently saw for the first time in twenty years, is an exception to this rule.  Admittedly I did not feel the same overwhelming excitement, amusement and awe that I experienced in my aunt's living room in 1986 -- I am no longer six years old -- but the **movie** itself is the same film, almost exactly as I remembered it.  It was like meeting an old friend after twenty years and finding that he had not aged a day.  So many scenes came flooding back to me:  Aykroyd sliding down the firepole; Moranis running around New York looking for the Gatekeeper; Weaver greeting Murray at the door in her vamp outfit; the precise movement of girl-Gozer's arms as she shouts, \\"Then DIE!!!\\"; the first appearance of the Marshmallow Man, glimpsed between the buildings... <br /> <br />Another commonly accepted fact is that comedy is harder to do well than drama.  Even so, I'm not sure people realize how much work goes into making a film like \\"Ghostbusters\\" as good as it is.  The steadily mounting levels of humor and terror in this film crescendo so effectively that, by the time Mr. Stay-Puft shows up, we willingly suspend our disbelief.  On some level I am aware as a viewer that our world isn't quite as wacky as the world of \\"Ghostbusters\\" -- but on some level I wish it were. <br /> <br />Seldom can the cast of a motion picture have been so intrinsic to its essence.  \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" would have been much the same film with Sean Connery as Gandalf, just as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" would be the same with W.C. Fields in the title role.  If John Belushi had lived to star in \\"Ghostbusters\\" instead of Bill Murray, or if John Candyhad signed up for the role taken by Rick Moranis, it probably would have been an excellent film... but it wouldn't have been the **same** film, not by any stretch of the imagination.  (But I have to say that Aykroyd delivers my favorite performance in the movie.) <br /> <br />As Ivan Reitman, Joe Medjuck and Harold Ramis point out on their DVD commentary, the unsung hero of \\"Ghostbusters\\" is Elmer Bernstein.  Unfairly overshadowed by Ray Parker Jr.'s deservedly successful theme song, Bernstein's music captures and enhances all the charm, humor and terror of this film, from the ickiness of Venkman throwing the slime on his hand onto the library books to the blossoming of the love theme for Venkman and Dana over the happiest of happy ending scenes. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, the feature of the film that stuck with me most strongly as a six-year-old is almost never mentioned in reviews:  the one moment of sincere manly emotion between Murray and Aykroyd's characters at the film's climax.  This moment, perfectly played by the two actors, does not even appear in the final shooting script and must have been a last minute addition.  It is very fitting that this moment is as brief as it is, and is soon forgotten in the jubilation of the end credit scene.  Little boys long for this kind of emotion, and yet at the same time are deeply embarrassed by it.  The heroes of \\"Ghostbusters\\" are the kind of adults most little boys want to grow up to be -- clever, funny, kind and brave.  And after twenty-two years \\"Ghostbusters\\" remains (and this is no criticism) one of the best movies ever made for those who are little boys at heart, whether they are six or twenty-seven. <br /> <br />And it has the best final line in the history of cinema.  \\"I LOVE THIS TOWN!!!\\"

B00005JOQS|1.0|I have been a fan of the Superman series since my dad took me to see the original in the theater back in 1978.  When I heard they were going to make another one, I was excited but at the same time, I could not imagine anyone else but Christopher Reeves playing the title role.  Yet, I was curious and my friends wanted to see it was well, so we all went ahead and saw it.  I want my money back! <br /> <br />This movie is a joke.  The plot is weak and the role of Superman is out of character.  There are siuations that Superman is in which he, the actor, acts and does things totally out of the character of Superman. <br /> <br />Lex Luther, played by Kevin Spacey, is a joke as well.  The simple truth is he simply is not believeable.  He does not act ruthless, nor does he seem to have a true hated for Superman.  He shows he would like to destroy him, but not with the zest that Gene Hackman showed.  In the original, it was clear that Lex Luther wanted to kill Superman <br /> <br />In the final analysis, it's obvious that this plot really does not make much sense at all.  A lot of things are not explained and there is no real climax.  If you are a Superman fan, I'd strongly recommend seeing the first two installments made back in 1978 and 1980.  And for you die hard Superman fans, you may be interested to know that Warner brothers is going to release a special edition of the fist 4 film when this one is released.  They are also going to release Richard Donner's version of Superman 2 which never has been released.  Donner was fired when the film was almost complete and the producers hired Richard Lester to take over and basically remake the movie.  It is rumoured that Donner's version of Superman 2 is far better than the one released.  As for this movie, the best part was during the credits where they dedicated the movie to Christopher and Dana Reeves.  Christopher, you are the real Superman!!!
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Starring Nicolas Cage as a Ukrainian immigrant who becomes a gun runner, this is what I would call a \\"black comedy\\" on a serious subject.  It's funny, fast-paced and interesting.  And  it's almost embarrassing to identify with the smooth talking and risk taking arms dealer whose business results in death and destruction.  Jared Leto is cast as Cage's younger brother and the two of them make a good team.  There's love interest, of course, played by Bridget Moynahan, the wife that Cage tries to keep in the dark about his real profession.<br /><br />The settings are Brooklyn, the Ukraine and parts of Africa and Nicholas Cage is at home in these places.  He's witty, self-confident and likable.  And the audience cannot help but feel some empathy with him.<br /><br />There's something about this film that reeks of bad taste.  But so what?  It's enjoyable, and it pokes fun at a profession that we all know exists.  I enjoyed it and recommend it although it's not for the squeamish.
B00005JOQS|1.0|I was hoping it would be good but it wasn't. Here's why. Parker Posey, Kate Bosworth are really bad actresses. Kevin Spacey as Lex was good but he wasn't in it enough. plot was slow. Effects were good but story was way too long. Brandon as Kent was good only look wise.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I purchased this for my kids - they really like these movies from producer Hayao Miyazaki. This one is about a young girl who finds harmony with nature when the world has been poisened from polution and war.  The few surviors learn to live with the land. <br /> <br />It's for kids 13 and over- younger kids wouldn't understand the meaning.

B00005MP58|5.0|This story, in all its variations, is wonderful . . . funny, heartbreaking, heartwarming and timeless.  This particular version is one of my favorites . . . comes closest to the book than any other.  The characters are well developed . . . and the actors well chosen.  Colin Firth is masterful as the \\"proud\\" Mr. Darcy . . . but he shows his warm side (albeit to only Elizabeth and his sister, Georgiana!), as well . . . he portrays a humbleness and eagerness to please without losing his sense of self!  An excellent performance . . . other actors have not always done, as well!  Six hours . . . and you want more!
B00005JOQS|3.0|\\"Superman Returns\\", written by Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris; directed by Bryan Singer.<br /><br />A long time ago, two Jewish boys from New York created an immortal figure in pop mythology, who has come to define the genre - the very state - of being a superhero.  But maybe that's a little too far back.<br /><br />About thirty years ago, a team of filmmakers decided once again to tell that story - the tale of Superman, \\"strange visitor from another planet, with powers far beyond that of mortal men\\".  I saw \\"Superman - The Movie\\" when I was thirteen, and was delighted.  Like many of my favorite movies, \\"Superman\\" was everything I wanted it to be, and some things that I didn't even know I wanted yet.<br /><br />\\"Superman\\" was also one of the first superhero comics that I read, and I responded strongly to the story's iconic qualities.  The first film (not counting the movie serials) preserved and expanded on those  elements.  In the forty years since his creation, Superman had gone from being an American icon to a world citizen, the 1978 movie ending with him soaring high above the earth.<br /><br />Which brings me to last Friday,  when I saw the latest version of the orphan son from the planet Krypton.<br /><br />Here, Superman's role has expanded yet again, this time to the scale of a Christ figure.  I suppose the parallels could always have been made, and here Mr. Singer and his writers don't hold back.  When his spacecraft again plummets down to the Kent family farm, Martha draws Kal-El from the wreck in a tableau meant to evoke Michelangelo's Pieta.  The film is rife with comments and images meant to evoke a divine quality - Luthor calls Superman a selfish god and later stabs him in the side; some of the flying stances mimic the crucifixion; and so on.<br /><br />It's a natural connection to make - a powerful son from the heavens is sent to lead, rescue and inspire us - but even taking Superman's considerable iconography into account, it's a rather outsized and unwieldly one.  I'm assuming that Mr. Singer intended it to give shading and dimension to the story, but instead it cloaks the proceedings in a veil of gloom.<br /><br />Superman represents something very specific to me, and while Mr. Donner's film captured it, I think Mr. Singer's misses the mark.  Superman is a product of the '30s - a figure of unabashed optimism emerging from the shadow of the Great Depression; the friendly, dependable policeman on everybody's block.  While I'm sure there was corruption then as now, Superman at that time represented the best that Americans could hope to be - powerful and just.  He was the other, the immigrant, but he was a part of us, too.  Christopher Reeve's goofy charm managed to make that very squareness sincerely work through its own merits.  In the current version, we're treated to the type of grey brooding, weighty symbolism, and life trade-offs better suited for Spider-Man or Batman.  But for me, Superman's never been that sort of hero.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to believe that he'd be so fixated on his past that he'd so thoroughly neglect his present as he does in this film, abandoning his adopted world and his true love to discover what we knew all along - Krypton was destroyed and he is the only survivor.  There's not much to motivate this, except that his home planet's former location was determined.<br /><br />Naturally, Lois (Kate Bosworth) is heartbroken, and while he's gone (it takes five years to get there and back, though it's not clear to me why Superman needs a spaceship at all) she moves on, marrying a clear surrogate (he's even a pilot, for goodness' sake).  She's written her article on \\"Why We Don't Need Superman\\", winning a Pulitzer in the process, and had a child.  This is what Superman (Brandon Routh, an eerie echo of Reeve's performance) returns to - while most of the world gleefully rejoices, Lois wants little to do with him.<br /><br />So mighty Kal-El, for all his fame and power, becomes a mopey ex-boyfriend.  When he's not involved in heroics, he's hovering over Lois' home, peering inside with his X-ray vision.  It's sympathetic for an ordinary guy, but it's more than a little creepy coming from an omnipotent super-being.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is at large, and once again up to mischief.  This is all Superman's fault, since he didn't show up to a hearing (again, why not hold off the Krypton trip until the guy who tried to detonate two nuclear warheads and drop California into the ocean is behind bars?).  Luthor high-tails it back to the Fortress of Solitude and steals all of the crystals that educated Superman on his maiden voyage to Earth.  It turns out that they're capable of far more than we realized (but, assuming that Superman knew that, left them unprotected for quite a while), and Luthor builds a far larger version of his previous plan.<br /><br />These parallel threads weave on throughout the story, but not before one more big surprise is unveiled.  The origin of this twist is extremely murky, and its emotional payoff somewhat limited, raising more questions than anything else.<br /><br />The Christ parable abruptly stops when the story requires a larger sacrifice to be made.  Superman has already lost Lois with no way to truly reunite with her; and the hero of the biggest tentpole picture of the summer can hardly be killed.  Lois changes her tune and decides 'we' need him after all, but since there's so little chemistry between them, it hardly means much.  The plot, Luthor notwithstanding, basically ends in a romantic stalemate.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film doesn't have its pleasures.  Most of the cast is fine, with Routh and Bozworth at least dispelling my concerns about baby-faced reporters.  The only true squandering is Parker Posey's moll - she's neither daffy sex-doll nor snappy spitfire, so it's hard to see why Luthor keeps her around.  The special effects are naturally on a grand scale, the technical portrayal of Superman is especially vivid, convincing and impressive.<br /><br />The Richard Donner \\"Superman\\" was a huge inspiration for the director, and it clearly shows.  Much of the film - from the acting styles of the cast, the faux-slit-scan credit sequence, the savvy blending of the retro-Daily Planet/Smallville/Americana/Clark Kent garb in a contemporary setting, the return of the John Williams score, right down to the labeling of a Kryptonite meteor - labors mightily to revive the feelings that many of us had in 1978.  Yet as a whole, the grafts don't take, not really. Mainly because, at its heart, it's not much like that film at all.<br /><br />\\"Superman - The Movie\\" made me wish I was Superman.  \\"Superman Returns\\" makes me glad I'm not.power, becomes a mopey ex-boyfriend.

0790731509|5.0|A classic for a reason.  If you haven't seen this one, you should.  Borrowed it from the library last week and we sat thru the whole thing in one sitting (something my husband very rarely does).  Definitely a man's movie, but I really liked it too.  The rebel inside you will aplaud.  If you like Oh Brother, Where Art Thou, this will give it more depth next time you're watching George Clooney on the chain gang.
1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters' Fingersmith is not for those faint of heart.  When you begin her amazing book you may recognize her graphic descriptions of the sad and deplorable conditions of the lives of the \\"working-poor\\" in Victorian London thanks to similar characterizations provided by authors such as Dickens, Emma Donoghue and Sheri Holman.<br /><br />Well sit down. That's just the warm up. Get a fresh drink ready to help you wash away the disgusting taste that will be soon left in your mouth. Get your teddy bear. Ms. Waters is about to introduce you to some things you haven't before considered.<br /><br />Be ready for duplicity, manipulation, heartbreak and suspense on par with few other historical fiction novels. Prepare for yourself to confront abandon, hopelessness and confinement. Prepare for heartbreak. Prepare for love.<br /><br />Can one prepare for such conflicting situations and feelings? Of course not. That's the joy of this wonderful story. Waters will surprise you and horrify you time and time again. I wanted to put the book down and hide; I wanted to quit reading and yet was compelled to continue. Thank God I did. This is one of those books that will burn its story into your mind.<br /><br />I also recommend the wonderful \\"Crimson Petal and the White\\" by Michael Faber for another enthralling and dark story of Victorian England's seedier side.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever been unforsightful enough to endure. Why does it matter if it is a perfect transfer or not? If they had a ferfect Blu-Ray transfer in glorious 1080p of a pile of crap, would that warrant 4 stars? I hope not. Well, it is the same situation here, unfortunately. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time with this embarrassment of cinema.
B00000I07P|1.0|I'm really starting to hate Bon Jovi like a passion. Out of all the stupid hair metal bands of the 80s, Bon Jovi has to be the worst of the entire bunch! Like all hair metal bands, Bon Jovi were very mainstream and were played constantly on MTV back in the day which was sad considering heavy metal is suppossed to be non-mainstream and it shouldn't have party anthems. I liked other bands like Slayer and Kreator which weren't mainstream and were very heavy. Bon Jovi are the complete opposite of Slayer and Kreator which is not good news at all.<br /><br />Let's start with their fans. While not as retarded as Atreyu or Simple Plan fans, Bon Jovi fans mostly consist of girls who act like the band's groupies or teenagers who hated Slayer, Kreator, or Death(the non-mainstream bands that ruled). They say sh i t like, \\"JOHN BON JOVI IS THE GREATEST!!! HE HAS SO MUCH PASSION!!! HE ROCKS THE HOUSE!!! I LOVE HIS HAIR!!!\\" Enough already! John Bon Jovi was a horrible vocalist who sounds like he's whining when he sings sh i t t y anthems that they play at school dances in the 80s. And please!!! The guitarist is not amazing and the bass is inaudible at best. The drumming is lame as well. For fu c k's sake, STOP TREATING THIS AWFUL BAND LIKE GODS!!! The songs as well, from a lyrical standpoint are so far from the standard heavy metal content that it's just stupid! Love ballads are NOT metal.<br /><br />So in conclusion, Bon Jovi has to be one of the most overrated bands in history and they just plain suck! For real somewhat mainstream 80s metal listen to Metallica(old), Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, or Dio. For real non-mainstream 80s metal listen to Slayer, Death, Kreator, or Celtic Frost.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The feeling you get after you have seen this film is so wonderful. <br />I have watched this film seven times in 7 days. bought the book (to see if it separates a great deal from the movie). and i've bought the soundtrack! just can't get enough of it... <br />A tremendous lovestory that can melt the hart of any stonecold creature. <br />I'm a little disappointed because they had eliminated so many characters from the book. but i still give it five stars just because of the feeling the movie brings to you!!! <br /> <br />See it! Read it! enjoy it....
0792165020|5.0|Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a talented but penniless young man, pretends to be a graduate of an elite school while playing piano at an upper-class garden party.  When he is asked to go to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the playboy son of a shipping magnate, to return to America, he sees an opportunity to taste the kind of high life that he has always dreamed of.  In Italy, he continues his pretense in order to ingratiate himself with Dickie and his fiancee, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow).  He becomes infatuated with Dickie and his lifestyle; his desperation to continue this idyllic new life leads him to increasingly desperate measures, ultimately including murder and the complex juggling of identities. <br /> <br />One of the many pleasures of this excellent film is watching the evolution of Ripley's character.  In the beginning, he is likeable.  As his situation deteriorates, we see his horror and panic as he commits crimes he had never anticipated.  We also see his dawning belief, powerfully dramatized at the end, that he can never go back to a time of innocence; he can only go forward, which means maintaining his deception at all costs.  It's a tribute to Damon's performance. <br /> <br />
B000006OS2|5.0|One of the most memorable parts of this film DVD is the quips that McLintock (John Wayne) uses. When about to punch a fellow, McLintock says: \\"I won't...I won't...The h___ I will!\\" When conversing with his estranged wife Catherine, who suspects him of adultery, he describes her attitude towards him as \\"having a burr under the saddle\\". She shows him the divorce papers to which he coolly replies: \\"No deal\\". There are various attitudes shown towards the Indians. Most of the men call them savages. But McLintock displays at least an element of fairness in dealing with them, protecting them in this instance against a false accusation.<br /><br />McLintock's adult daughter also comes from the east, wanting to find out why her father and mother are at odds with each other.  She really does not consider it her business. Later on, several of the women have a conversation, and they mention the fact that men are accused of things most of which are not true.<br /><br />Finally, what western would not be complete with endless processions of cattle and horses, repeated fistfights, garish drunken sprees, etc? This film has it all. I will not spoil the plot, for those who have not seen the film yet, by disclosing what happens between McLintock and his estranged wife at the end of the film.
B000FA57RG|4.0|On her first (!) live CD, Madonna releases a concert performance from her \\"Re-Invention\\" tour backed by a 2 hour documentary titled \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\" on DVD.  The live CD is an interesting affair, with Madonna breathing new life into her vast catalogue of pop/dance songs.  The material leans a bit heavily on her 2003 album, the stiff \\"American Life,\\" but Madonna is at her best when she rips through the classics such as \\"Vogue,\\" \\"Like a Prayer,\\" and \\"Holiday.\\"  As for the documentary itself, it's entertaining and it will hold your attention, but it's no \\"Truth or Dare.\\"  It weaves together behind-the-scenes footage with Madonna coupled with clips from the Re-Invention tour. Still, any film that shows the Material Girl drop the f-bomb in front of her father is definitely worth a look.
B000BJS4OY|4.0|The video is a rare view at an early live concert. Unfrotunetely, it is an EXTREMELY LOW quality picture.<br /><br />I'd be interested in knowing if anyone else thinks the Boss is stoned during the show.<br /><br />HOWEVER, it is still a great set well worth the price.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is back in a big way! After the hum-drum Lateralus release we are finally back to the Tool we all know and love. This album has the haunting, surreal guitar and percussion instrumentals that are a hallmark of this unique band, as well as very cool lyrics and one of the, no I take that back, THE coolest CD case of any band ever! Welcome back to Maynard and the boys, your fans have missed you.
B000001EL7|3.0|This album is ok, but was filled with filler material such as  Then she...., Hooligan, Got love for sale and tomorrow and tonight. Thats 40% filler. That along with really weak production (probably rushed at the time) equalls 60% ok review.. aka 3 stars... Not one of their better albums.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Many other people have already written some very informative reviews of this movie, so I won't discuss the actual film except to say that I have enjoyed it very, very much.  Also, everybody I have made to watch Battle Royale is always blown away!   <br /> <br />What I really want to write about here are the details about this particular DVD edition.  It is, indeed, a region-free DVD and should, therefore, be viewable with any DVD player.  This edition was apparantly produced specifically for the US and other English-speaking nations as the information on the case cover is entirely in English.  I suspect that it is possibly a bootleg but the quality is great! The transfer is very good and the subtitles are excellent!  This disc contains a lot of interesting special features, most of which also contain good English subtitles. <br /> <br />I previously purchased a 2-disc Korean version of this movie also containing English subtitles.  For the most part, the subtitles here are the same as the Korean edition.  However, the subtitles are more clearly presented in the this edition and are better timed!  Also, there are a few occasions (not many, but they are there) in the Korean edition where the subtitles don't make a bit of sense.  That problem has been corrected in this edition.  The special features on this disc appear to be the same as those on the second disc of the Korean edition.  The Korean disc, however, does not have subtitles for any of the special features. <br /> <br />All in all, this Uncut Special Edition of Battle Royale (labelled Battle Royale Directors Cut on Amazon) appears to be about the best version available for American audiences!  Unfortunately, this excellent film has never been distributed domestically in the US, and it probably never will.  There has been some confusion about this.  Many people are under the impression that Battle Royale has been banned in the US.  This is simply not true.  Battle Royale was a blockbuster in the Japanese theaters upon its original release in 2000.  Therefore, Toei studios is demanding far more money for US distribution rights than any US distributor would ever be willing to pay. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this movie for fans of thought-provoking action movies!  There are many versions available.  So be careful when making your selection.

It's been that way with all of the Boynton books.  For some reason, they've had to grow on her and then suddenly we can't get enough of them!
B000002KAT|5.0|This album remains an enigma because it's Van Morrison's most critically acclaimed album, yet it doesn't contain any \\"hits\\". Most people are familiar with Van Morrison, may have heard this is the best one from reading Rolling Stone or something, but are unfamiliar with all the tracks. So, here are some things you need to know...<br /><br />1. This album is NOT for everybody. Normal people who take huge amounts of interest in mainstream tripe such as reality shows, tabloid magazines, American Idol, Nickelback, the Bush Adminstration, as well as those who do things like drive too slow in the fast lane, think ALL kids are cute, or annoy others in restaurants and theatres with senseless yapping about meaningless topics, should steer clear of this album. The lyrics of the first track, also entitled Astral Weeks, declares \\"I am nothing but a stranger in this world.\\" This album is intended for those with similar beliefs and experience what society considers \\"abnormal\\" thought process.<br /><br />2. This is an EXPERIMENTAL PUNK album. Astral Weeks is in the same category as The Velvet Underground, Wire, Sonic Youth, The Jesus & Mary Chain, etc. The publications that rate this album the highest are also the same publications that rate albums like Daydream Nation and Marquee Moon so high. Visit fastnbulbous.com to see Astral Weeks at #3 right behind The Stooges & Talking Heads.<br /><br />It belongs in this category because it does not conform to any uniform standard of music, is free of structure, choruses, and the same bland tunings that every other band uses. Furthermore, as mentioned before, its targeted audience is unique people with different thinking patterns, strangers in this world. It's a mixture of tones (instruments & vocals) harmoniously combined to create the perfect sound.<br /><br />3. Contrary to some people's opinions who do not like the album, this is NOT hippy music, nor a product of 1968. There is no resemblance whatsoever to Donovan, The Youngbloods or anything psychadelic. While it may be good listening for drug-induced euphoric late-nights, there should be no comparisons to Uriah Heep.<br /><br />It breaks down like this...if you're definition of brilliant is being unique and unconventional, you are considered a bit unique and brilliant yourself, buy the album right away and prepare to become seriously addicted within a few weeks.<br /><br />If you have interest in Van Morrison b/c you heard Brown Eyed Girl at a wedding reception, or playing over the intercom at the grocery store while you were getting the latest on Brittney's new baby, I encourage you to check Van Morrison's greatest hits and skip this one.<br /><br />If the other CD you own is a Shania Twain, if you're puzzled why Lindsey Lohan hasn't been nominated for any awards, or bummed because Joan of Arcadia is a re-run this week, not only skip the album, but also avoid dating any person who claims to be an all-time fave.<br /><br />If you consider Blink-182 to be a legitimate punk band, shop at Hot Topic, and are eagerly anticipating going to The Warped Tour, you may dig this album, but not yet. Wait a few years for that all to pass. While this is very popular with the punk/alternative crowd, there's not one crunching guitar on the whole album. This is pretty advanced listening also. Next you'll hit Radiohead, then venture into more obscure territories, then this. Be patient.<br /><br />Die-hard heavy metal fans who judge ALL music by the sheer heaviness of its guitar riffs should steer clear too.

0312323867|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Emily Giffin's Something Borrowed. The character of Rachel struck just the right chord of sympathy and horror at what she was doing (sleeping with her best friend's fiance). The way that Giffin is able to draw you into her story and make Rachel such a sympathetic character is amazing. You find yourself rooting for her despite the situation. And you find yourself despising Darcy even though she is technically the one wronged. In Something Blue, Darcy takes over the story. Shallow and unbelievably self-righteous, Darcy is pregnant with her ex-fiance's groomsman's baby. Fianceless and friendless, she invites herself to stay at long-time friend Ethan's (who is more Rachel's friend than hers) and has to come to grips with the state of her life. Although I was interested in knowing the rest of the story, I just couldn't get into Darcy. It is hard for me to believe that she completely changes her entire personality in such a short time. I just can't connect with her. It is an interesting book as a continuation but I couldn't root for the main characters' relationship. I found myself thinking that he could do better. But if you read Something Borrowed, read Something Blue ... you might not be completely satisfied, but you'll like seeing where the characters end up.

B00005JOQS|4.0|It is inevitable that 'Superman Returns' will be compared to the series of 'Superman' movies starring Christopher Reeves that came out in the eighties, but it is best to judge this movie on its own terms.  'Superman Returns' is a fitting return for the caped crusader with advantages and disadvantages from its predecessors.  The technology and grandeur are stunning enough, and the situations he's placed into are dire enough to keep our interest for long stretches throughout.  The acting is a mixed bag, and the side melodrama, while not as compelling as 'Spiderman 2,' is interesting enough to garner its place in the movie. <br /> <br />Superman returns after a voyage from the his home planet, Krypton, leaving a void that was filled by Lois Lane with a lover and a boy--and a world returning to injustice.  She is resentful, and he has much explaining to do, but his return is timely enough to coincide with a wrinkle in the justice system:  Lex Luther has found a loop-hole, upon which he may return to the civilized world and wreak havoc.  The causality of his criminal mayhem should raise eyebrows by motive and method:  He wishes to control the world by creating new land via small samples of crystals obtained from Superman's arctic lair.  He will lay waste with his new land creation and implement an environmental terrorism meant to wipe out billions of people and near continents, both submerged under water.  Next, he will be in charge of the new real estate.  The execution of the plot certainly creates substantial tension where the unintentional silliness fails to make us believe... <br /> <br />It is Kevin Spacey's portrayal as Lex Luther, however, that bridges much of the credibility gap.  While Gene Hackman's portrayal was thoroughly entertaining as Luther, Spacey's is creepy and menacing.  And the directing has made all the difference.  While madcap director Richard Lester ('A Hard Day's Night', et al) made the 'Superman' series into a glorious cartoon, Bryan Singer turns 'Superman' into a foreboding spectacle.  This is not to say there aren't funny moments, but the general campiness of the Lester fare has been abandoned for a more taut adventure.  The other performances aren't as worthwhile, but they do provide a different venue.  Brandon Routh's Superman provides quiet strength, but little of Reeve's charisma.  He does the duo identities decently, but not spectacularly.  He is nerdy enough as Kent, but only exhudes the strong silent type to sustain his stature.  Similarly, Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane is attractive enough in looks and personality, but there are a few missing nuances as well. Comparisons to Margot Kidder aren't fair because she did well for Lester's carnival atmosphere.  Bosworth gives us an immediate emotional anchor for the film's plots, though. Also, sometimes the plot is fragmented, which can only be justified as a series of warm-ups for the main plot.   <br /> <br />In sum, 'Superman Returns' does to Superman what 'Batman Begins' does to Batman.  It removes the campiness, returns to basics, and starts to thrill us with ominous adventure.  Only in 'Superman Returns' it doesn't do it as well.

My toddler, Ethan, doesn't care much for stories just yet (he's into books that show pictures of things), but this one really caught his attention.  It is very creative and not too short or too long.  An exciting adventure.
B000B8QF14|2.0|I was excited by Green Day releasing a live DVD.  I enjoy concert DVD's and I was impressed with Green Day's American Idiot album.  I do not consider myself a huge fan, but I recognize a well-crafted album when confronted with it.  I do believe they outdid themselves with American Idiot.  In the end, this concert DVD was very disappointing for me.  I am quite sure that their many diehard fans will enjoy the DVD, but casual fans or others who just enjoy good concert experiences may wish to steer clear.  In fairness, their performance is solid.  The vocals and music are quite good live.  Certainly that much cannot be said for some bands.  So to be fair, you do get a good recording of quite a few of their hits.  It is in the concert's entertainment value that I felt really let down or underwhelmed.  Billie Joe is evidently talented, but he is not the greatest entertainer (crown and cape aside - I suppose it takes a little more to reach me).  Some have complained that the concert is interrupted with interview clips.  This was no real detraction for me because you can pretty easily skip to the next track.  The problem for me was in the interviews themselves.  There was no real point.  Nothing was compelling.  I did not feel I was getting any real insight into who the band is or what they are about.  The other possible conclusion is that the problem is in the band itself.  Maybe they are just not that deep.  For a group that has been together for 16 years and who should display the correlating maturity, I just didn't see it.  As for showmanship, the closest they came was their facial expressions.  Billie Joe shouted &#34;England&#34; and &#34;come on&#34; quite frequently.  He insisted on introducing many of the songs by title, which seems largely unnecessary and out of place.  He led the crowd in chants of &#34;hey&#34; and in clapping and arm waving.  But that was it.  Everything else was just strutting or running around the stage.  Big deal.  The concert did have the requisite fireworks and pyrotechnics.  But I would prefer to be impressed with the showmanship of the band members rather than the gadgets.  As far as Billie Joe's antics on stage, he did seem a little loose in referencing rednecks and Americans as necessarily one and the same.  In introducing his band mates he was pretty sophomoric (whether in pretending a sax note was flatulence or in speaking gushingly about Mike's or Tre's nakedness).  Maybe it's a punk rock thing.  I think it's just pretty simple and tired and would like to have seen more substance.  In the end, you get a pretty good live recording of some of their biggest hits... no more and no less.  Maybe that should be enough.  It just wasn't for me.  This recording is probably best reserved for hardcore Green Day fans.

0425156842|5.0|To date I've bought 27, yes twenty-seven, copiesof this book. Jostein Gaarder did a great job writing it. Sophie is a young girl, who finds herself enrolling in... a correspondence course of sorts regarding philosophy... before long she finds herself in an Alice-in-Wonderland sort of aventure through her life, and someone named Helga's. The book was written for children, by a childrens teacher to help them learn philosophy and to help develop a philisophical view on life. I've given a copy of this book to many many people that I know and they've all enjoyed it. I suggest reading it a few times after you purchase it. Now stop reading my review and BUY THIS BOOK!<br /><br />-Ryan Mercer
0446677450|5.0|Before reading this book, I was doing okay.  I had a good job with benefits, saving money and also putting money away in my 401K.  A friend recommended this book to me in May of 2005.  Prior to reading this book, I had not read more than 2 books in the prior 10years.  I went through this book in about two days and I must say it changed a lot of my views about money. <br /> <br />This book explained an asset as anything you own that puts money in YOUR pocket.  If it does not put money in your pocket, it is not an asset to you.  For example, he explains that most people incorrectly call the home they live in an asset even though the home is taking money out of their pockets in the form of the mortgage, taxes, electric bill, etc.  He goes on to explain that most people have a very low financial IQ which leads them to call liabilities assets.  He also goes into cash flow and the importance of maintaining a positive cash flow in ones life while working to increase the flow of passive income.  This is very important because you achieve financial freedom when your passive income is greater than your expenses.  I could go on but you just have to go get the book and read it. <br /> <br />A little over a year after reading this book, I am still doing okay and working at my good job but I am also now buying and investing in assets (things that put money in my pocket).  I now understand that the home I live in is NOT an asset to me.  It is however an asset to the bank because it is putting money into their pocket.  I now read a whole lot more books and in that past year have read more books than I had since my college days.  I have improved my financial IQ and work daily to keep improving it.  <br /> <br />This book is simple to read and is written so that even a 9year old can understand it (which was Robert Kiyosaki's intent).  I have since bought my own copy of this book and bought and read 5 others in the rich dad series.  I have shared the books with my friends and  family(especially the young one) because I which I had read this book 10yrs ago when I was in still college.  If I had, I know I would be probably financially free today.  Not to worry though, with the knowledge I have gained since reading this book, I am sure I will be financially free in less than 10yrs. <br /> <br />I would also recommend the following books, all read in the past year :) <br /> <br />Cashflow Quadrant by Robert Kiyosaki <br /> <br />Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: What the Rich Invest in, That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not by Robert Kiyosaki <br /> <br />Rich Dad's Prophecy by Robert Kiyosaki <br /> <br />Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker <br /> <br />One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch

B00005JLYW|4.0|I know everyone is going to say that my reveiw is not useful before they even read it but thats ok.  I thought that this movie was a great ride.  Its fun fluff and is not ment to be taken seriously.  Thats where its strenght is.  It know exactly what vibe it wants to give off and it does that perfectly.  The action is really well choreographed and the actresses are good and making their angel an individual, not in the \\"crash\\" way, but in the \\"mary-kate and ashley\\" way.  Im so happy that Lucy Lui made this movie because i was so tired of seeing her as a angery serious character, but rather wanted to see her bubbly side.  The cinematoraphy is B-E-A-Utiful.  Everything is alive with color from the boxes in the irish mob boat, to Cameron Deiz's wet beach hair.  The look of this movie is great.  The story is slim and the movie is very silly but i personally dont want to sit through a History of Violence everytime i go and see a action movie.  But then again...i might just be alone on that one....
B0002UOK04|5.0|Wow. Just Wow. This is a brilliant CD, for several reasons. This cd contains some of the best song lyrics (and associated vocal performances) I have ever heard. You can tell that Wintersun are playing right from the soul! Jari's voice is simply AMAZING here, because he spectacular at both regular singing, and harsh growling (listen to a sample song- his growl voice is amazingly understandable and clear, and his tenor voice is beautiful). One peculiar thing that I noticed is that each song gets progressively longer than the one before it. Now for the individual song ratings: <br /> <br />Beyond the dark sun- (2:40) <br />This is the song that got me interested in the band. I had received the \\"Monsters of metal\\" nuclear blast video collection as a gift, and this song was on the 3rd volume dvd. I thought to myself that this band had extreme potential (and this was a short song, too; only 2:40) so I had to check out the rest of their material. There is a nice breakdown/tempo change at 1:20, and the lyrics are perfect for an introductory song. (10/10) <br /> <br />Winter Madness- (5:08) <br />This song starts out with furious blastbeats on the drums, with melodic guitars. Soon, Jari introduces you to his Tenor singing (absolutely great), and this makes you say \\"wow.\\" The drums are relentless and insanely good here, as the drummer does blastbeats for over half of the (5:08) song. Some really fantastic lyrics here: \\"My hands are frozen, my mind is at the edge of madness; Oh how many nights and days, I've been lost in this land of sadness...\\" The lyrics are the thing that REALLY impressed me about wintersun- I can't reiterate enough how good they are. Read some of them on the internet, because they are truly impressive.  This song also contains the album's best guitar solo, and because of these aforementioned things, I would say this is one of the best songs on the CD. (10/10) <br /> <br />Sleeping Stars- (5:41) <br />This song slows the tempo way down to an almost dream-like tempo. For some reason, I am compelled to say it was too abrupt of a tempo change, as it interrupts the onslaught of songs that is to follow. Nevertheless, the song is very good once it gets going. Good lyrics as usual, competent drumming and guitar playing, it was just the abrupt tempo change that was bugging me. (8/10) <br /> <br />Battle Against Time- (7:02) <br />Again, we get a furious blastbeat intro. Good tempo change at (1:56) that picks up the pace, and thrusts you right into the main part of the song. I feel that this song is a tad overlong though (at 7:02- not that you can't have songs this long in the genre, as you will see below, it's just that this song doesn't seem musically diverse enough). (9/10) <br /> <br />Death and the Healing- (7:12) <br />Another slower song, but this one is flawless. Clean singing to start out the song, with a cool melodic beat for the guitars. On almost all the songs, there are keyboards in the background to give the songs additional texture, and in this song they work really well. Great guitar solos in this song, too! The guitars work really well with the keyboards. You can hear the bass in all of Wintersun's songs, and in this one especially, the bass work is exceptional. Great drum work rounds out this perfect song. (10/10) <br /> <br />Starchild- (7:53) <br />This song still blows my mind, even after listening to it well over 100 times. The song starts out with furious double-bass work for the drums, complex melodic riffs for the guitars, and great bass lines. The use of keyboards in this song is absolutely perfect - the keyboards accentuate, but never become a leading element. This song is very fast, and after a rhythm change at (0:46), it seems even faster. This song is very complex musically, as there are many breakdowns, and five distinct segments to the lyrics. This song has some of the best song lyrics I have ever heard. Here is a sample:  <br />\\"But I will make the time run backwards and <br />I'll make the stars shine again <br />I will light up the sky to a bright, crimson nights <br />... And they'll shine together forever <br />With brilliant silver colours they'll shine, forever!\\" <br />When you put these lyrics into the context of the song, they are wholly moving and unbelievable and great. Every element of this song is truly perfect, and that makes it the best song on the album by far. (7:53) of musical perfection! (10/10) <br /> <br />Beautiful Death- (8:15) <br />This is a great song to bang your head to, if you are in to that sort of thing. Crunchy guitars and bass play a chugging rhythm at the start, while the drums perfectly accentuate things. Jari belts out the central lyric to this song: \\"'Cause life is just a beautiful death!\\" Great guitar solo at (4:45) goes on for 40 seconds, and there are blastbeats abound for the drums. The drumming on this album is truly something to be admired (I wish I could find a session drummer like Kai). The ending segment of this song starts at (6:54) with beautiful operatic singing. The last segment also features keyboards and the light playing of the guitar, to create a beautiful effect. It is another great one by Wintersun! (10/10) <br /> <br />Sadness and Hate - (10:15) <br />This is the longest song on the disc. The introduction of the song is very atmospheric, as is much of the song. It is slower than the other songs, which makes for a suitable last song. Competent drum work and guitars; Wintersun retain the folk vibe they are known for in this song. Jari's great tenor singing round out this song. (9/10)   <br /> <br />Overall: (96/100) <br />or: (5/5) <br /> <br />Based on the superb quality of this CD, I am simply dumbfounded that Wintersun have not received more recognition. I would recommend this disc to people who like melodic death metal and/or any kind of folk metal (and fans of Ensiferum for obvious reasons). The production is perfect- no element of the music becomes too leading, it just blends together perfectly.Wintersun is the brainchild of Jari Mäenpää, and he deserves ALL of the credit for putting this album together- he played every instrument on the recording, save for drums (which were played by a fantastic session drummer). He also did all of the producing for this album. I look forward to Wintersun's new (2006) CD with great expectations; now that they have a full band, it will be interesting to see what they sound like. Hopefully they can iron out the minor flaws (after all, it was their debut record) and take their music to the next level.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|The newest Mike Patton Album Peeping Tom is definitly some more great work by Patton, there are some really damn good songs on this album such as Five Seconds, Mojo, We're not Alone remix, and so on, and they just blow you away because their great, but there a few other songs that are just too dry because of rapping on it, and they get boring, I think throw out those songs and you got a great record. Thats the only problem I had with the album other than that its def worth the buy.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|How was that for a pithy review title? hah <br /> <br />Yep, the first time I saw SOTD this I thought it was okay. <br />but then I kept thinking about parts of the movie. <br />So..I watched it again!! This is a really intelligently written film though the title is deceptive.  Surprisingly good acting and directing, some of the composition of the shots are amazing. <br />AND LOTS OF FUN! and there is a couple of scenes you may rewind and watch over and over! (Like the scene in Blue velvet where <br />the guy sings the roy orbison song) <br />My top 3 picks of the last couple years, Shaun of the Dead, <br />Batman Begins, Napoleon Dynamite (which I also had to see over again.  Thats a sign of a great movie if you want to view it over and over!
B000F48CD8|4.0|I see Jack White's history all in reverse. Here he is, making obvious chord changes, all in patsy slaphappy mokeys melodies, who, zep and you name it references. Power rock? You did it before, better. Honestly, I dissapprove. He started with Canon fergodsake, on the self titled debut! Have you heard it? Where's the punk gone? Where's the twisted lyrics? What is this 1975 brit smorgasbord? <br /> <br />I've turned the disc a few times, and the genius is apparent, as usual. But better to carry through a new authentic self inspired and noncommercial sound than serve me this pop, it is too sweet. The band is tight, the tunes are very well produced and very good, but I am not slayed. Shucks.
0671015206|2.0|I'm a 19 year old business owner looking for some tips on how to make wise decisions financially. I have recently started to read some of the popular financial books. I picked this one up a few weeks ago, and have become pretty disappointed.  <br /> <br />Very nicely written by two doctors, this book includes tons of data from a research experiment done on millionaires. The problem I have with this book is that after reading almost the whole thing, I have only come out with a few new ideas. Be frugal your whole life, buy used cars, and don't give your children cash gifts. <br /> <br />The book starts out pretty enjoyable, but once you realize that they keep stretching the same message over and over again, it gets very boring. For instance, there is a whole chapter (about 40 or so pages) set aside for telling you that most millionaires buy their cars a year or 2 old to save money. Completely unneccesary. Also, there's another chapter set aside to tell you not to give your children cash.  <br /> <br />It's a book that backs up common sense ideas with an in depth study of the affluent. Not very helpful, I don't recommend it.  <br /> <br />So, skip this book.. all you'll learn is to be frugal, buy cars used, don't give your kids cash, and spend time studying the market. Chances are, you know these ideas already!
1400095913|4.0|I first heard about this author and this book from a colleague of mine at a NJ library. She loved it and I knew her to be a lady with a dark sense of humor. When I took her up on it and read the book, I was fascinated. At times, the notion of a dark Passenger, controlling Dexter's behavior seems a little contrived but his ability to sense the dark Passengers in others and the results of that could be construed as laudable. Either way, Dexter is a character who resonates with anyone who has ever wondered if we all see the world the same way or not. (Especially if you think others don't see the world the way you do!) His attempts to imitate \\"real life\\" remind me of children on the autism spectrum of disorders and gives me a sense of what they must go through. Dexter handles \\"real life\\" with a wry sense of humor - surely an important ingredient in success!

B000002G0P|5.0|Sometimes truly great art just goes unappreciated; whether it is film, literature, or music. The Boston band Extreme's third album \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" (1992) stands as the perfect example of something that, because of timing, just flew over the radar of the public's consciousness. Truly a masterpiece (and I don't just throw that word around arbitrarily) \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" is one of the finest rock albums that I have ever heard. Equal parts the Beatles, Queen, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and the Chili Peppers; \\"III Sides\\" is an ambitious concept album that just didn't come out at the right time.<br /><br />While Extreme's self-titled debut (1989) was decent, it was ultimately just another by-the-numbers, Van Halen-lite 80s rock album. Extreme proved themselves, however, on their classic sophomore release \\"Pornograffiti,\\" which was far more rocking, well-written, and ambitious than the debut. The album's major single, the acoustic \\"More than Words\\" was somewhat of a double-edged sword for the band. While it was a huge hit, going on to become one of the biggest singles of the year, it gave the public the wrong impression of the band. While Extreme was a gifted, hard-rocking eclectic band, encompassing many sounds and styles, \\"More than Words\\" gave people the idea that Extreme were light-weights.<br /><br />Extreme were far from lightweights, however. Lead guitarist Nuno Bettencourt was an up-and-coming virtuoso, the \\"new Eddie Van Halen\\" that could rival the original Ed in terms of technique and musicianship. Charismatic frontman Gary Cherone, (a sort of cross between Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Queen's Freddie Mercury) a thoughtful lyricists, proved to be the perfect voice for the band's eclectic style. Paul Geary's intense drumming and Pat Badger's funk-laden bass were several cuts above average, providing an exciting rhythm section and was an electrifying counterpart to Nuno's exhilarating, screeching, guitar work.<br /><br />As the band went underway to make their third album there was a major shift in rock with the release of Nirvana's groundbreaking \\"Nevermind\\" (1991). Nirvana's seminal album changed the entire landscape of popular music, moving youth culture away from AOR melodic-hard rock, to fully embrace alternative rock. Overnight, bands that were extremely (no pun intended) popular were instantly killed off and rendered obsolete. Extreme was unfortunately one of those bands that got left out in the cold during the grunge/alt. rock heyday of the early 90s.<br /><br />Recorded during the rise of alterative rock, \\"III Sides\\" wasn't a response to the public's changing taste, but was just the next step in the evolution of Extreme. While the band's signature sound, a sort of Aerosmith/Van Halen/Zeppelin hybrid with a little bit of funk, is fully intact, \\"III Sides\\" saw Extreme reinvent themselves, adding a touch of the theatrical, a touch of Queen into the equation.<br /><br />\\"III Sides\\" is both progressive and retro, and is equal parts 70s, 80s and 90s. It has the theatrical flair of 70s-era Queen with Rush-esque prog rock compositions, the 80s style guitar heroics of vintage Van Halen and the decades signature sing-along lush background harmonies, with a crisp 90s production.<br /><br />Divided into three sections, \\"Yours,\\" \\"Mine,\\" and \\"The Truth,\\"  \\"III Sides\\" is a high-art concept album.<br /><br />The \\"Yours\\" section consists of hard-rocking, guitar-heavy songs, and is musically the most Van Halen-esque part of the album. These songs are political, focusing on racism, war and peace, and institutions (wikepedia).<br /><br />The album slows down considerably, but is no less enthralling, for the \\"Mine\\" section, which is less guitar-oriented, and sees the introduction of more keyboards, and experimentation. The songs move away from worldly/political issues all together, dealing with meditative, self-reflecting subjects (wikepedia).<br /><br />The third and final \\"the truth\\" is itself divided into three sections, under the heading \\"everything under the sun.\\" The three sections here include \\"rise and shine,\\" \\"am I ever gonna change,\\" and `who cares.\\" This section of the album can be considered prog rock in terms of format and style, with alternations in time signature and complex intricate arraignments, including a 70-piece orchestra. Lyrically, the themes are more religious and philosophical (wikepedia).<br /><br />NOTE-I am citing wikepedia as a source because it describes the details of the technical aspects of the album.<br /><br />YOURS:<br /><br />The breakneck opening \\"Warheads,\\" as the title suggests, is about war, and peoples willingness to kill, as Cherone states \\"hey kid, wanna have some fun, choose a side and here's your gun.\\" The cynical \\"rest in peace\\" points out the simplicity and nativity of such cliches as \\"make love not war\\" and warns the listener to not take world-affairs and complex global situations lightly. The funk-laded \\"Politicalamity\\" discuses governmental institutions and is musically akin to \\"Pornograffiti's\\" \\"lil' Jack Horny.\\"  The melodic \\"Color Me Blind\\" looks at racism while \\"Cupid's Dead\\" examines the media. The closing \\"Peacemaker Die\\" explains how people who try to make a difference or strive for world peace are destined to be murdered. A clip from Martin Luther King Jr's \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech works very nicely.<br /><br />It should be noted that with the tragedy of 911 still fresh in people's memories and hearts, and with the current turmoil in the middle-east, these songs seem more relevant now than they did back in 1992.<br /><br />MINE:<br /><br />The opening waltz, \\"Seven Sundays\\" (which features no guitars, only keyboards) is a total change of pace as it is a radical departure from the album's previous songs. The outstanding \\"Tragic Comic\\" tells of the protagonist's struggle to be himself on a date. It's very honest with a real sense of humility. It's very Beatles-esque, with the solo sounding as though George Harrison himself had played on the track. \\"Our Father\\" looks at family relations, and the feelings of having an absentee father, and asks whether or not family patterns are destined to repeat themselves. \\"Stop the Word,\\" is a rather morose, depressed plea to not have to deal with life/people/the world.  \\"God isn't Dead?\\" acts as a prelude to \\"the truth,\\" as Cherone pleads for the confirmation of God's existence.<br /><br />THE TRUTH:<br /><br />The third and final part, \\"the truth\\" is musically the most ambitious, with orchestration and is religious/philosophical in theme. Although the subject matter in \\"the truth\\" could be interpreted as Judeo-Christian, it encompasses universal themes that could be applied to all faiths.<br /><br />Epic, beautiful and breathtaking, \\"Rise n' Shine\\" sees the dawn of a new day, the optimism and hope that one can strive for. The equally majestic \\"Am I Ever Gonna Change\\" asks just that. While Cherone seems frustrated with who he is as a person, he seems to resign himself to destiny, but hopeful that he can strive forward. The closing \\"Who Cares?\\" is the album's most pessimistic piece. Wrapping up \\"the truth,\\" Cherone seems apathetic, yet at the same time extremely frustrated with the futility of life, asking \\"who cares?\\" as in, what's the meaning of it all? But as loud as he pleads, perhaps to the listener, perhaps to God, perhaps to himself, he knows that no answer will be forthcoming.<br /><br />Extreme's \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" is many things...epic, ambitious, thoughtful, breathtaking, angry, morose, beautiful...This album is a true masterpiece that deserves to be heard. The fact that this album is out-of-print is as sad as it is appalling. The fact that this album went unnoticed because of the fickle nature of the public is very sad indeed. Still, \\"III Sides\\" is available used so it shouldn't be hard to own a copy. Hopefully someday it will be re-issued, preferably with detailed liner notes. As it is, \\"III Sides\\" has achieved somewhat of a cult-status.<br /><br />If you missed \\"III Sides\\" the first time around, do yourself a favor and check out this album to see for yourself how brilliant it is.gs of having an absentee father, and asks whether or not family patterns are destined to repeat themselves. \\"Stop the Word,\\" is a rather morose, depressed plea to not have to deal with life/people/the world.  \\"God isn't Dead?\\" acts as a prelude to \\"the truth,\\" as Cherone pleads for the confirmation of God's existence.

B000002AGE|5.0|I first heard this as an album in the late '70's.  It was great to find the cd to share with my boys and wife.  The music was as good as I remembered and your services was as well.  Weather Report is one of the best fusion groups to come around and this was their best recording.  It inspired me to search for more memories of other groups and as usual you came through on each search.  I purchased a total of about ten cds of music from that time in my young adult life.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon, I am a customer for life.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning. I put up with them during, SOFAD (gospel vocals should NOT be on a DM record), Exciter and Ultra. I went to their shows and was contentlistening to the old songs praying, they would one day return to their glory. <br /> <br />Well I wasn't expecting too much when I heard they were coming out with a new record last year. I LOVED IT!!! They have returned back to their dark wonderful glory!! Daves vocals make a girl happy! I also was amazed at what a great writing job Dave did with his 3 songs. Now I am looking forward to another. A great moody, sexy record!!
0670033375|5.0|The book was a very good book.  I wounder if the high gas prices in parts of Europe like Holland and other places have anything to do with their chances of seeing December 31, 2100?  It makes you realize that the peoples who have at least 10% chance of not seeing 2100 as an intact people are not all primative hunters and gathers, some of such peoples have reached the post industrial level of sophication.  Some of those peoples could easily be the finaciers of all threatened peoples including themselves.  Some examples of state socities that might not be around in 2100 are Beglium, the Neatherlands, and the small island nations as well as others.  It just to shows you that maybe we need include the Dutch and some others on the list of threatened peoples, which inludes the tribes of the Amazon and others, to wake people up on global warming.
0312995423|2.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code, I was a fan of Dan Brown, but Digital Fortress was a big disappointment.  The romantic parts were cheesy.  The book, and especially the ending (which was very predictable), is an insult to cryptographers who were supposed to be the best of the best in the book but who took half the book to figure out a simple riddle that took a common person like me all of 2 minutes to solve.  This book fails to challenge the reader intellectually.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|Dear Sir or Madam: <br /> <br />     I am writing to you to inform you of my response to my shipment from the above seller. I am very Impressed with the seller and I want to give him a THUMBS UP.
B000777J2S|3.0|THIS ARTIST IS DEFINETLY ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE AND TALENTED GUYS I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. RIGHT AWAY HIS MUSIC CAUGHT MY EAR AND I WAS TRIPPED OUT WITH THE VOCALS. THERE ARE ABOUT 4 REALLY GOOD SONGS ON THE RECORD AND THE REST ARE FILLERS. I AM AWARE THAT THE ALBUM DID GET THE MERCURY PRIZE THOUGH I FELT IT COULD HAVE GONE TO BETTER ARTISTS SUCH AS SUFJAN STEVENS OR SOMETHING. I LOVE THE TRACK \\"MY LADY STORY\\".. MY FAVORITE SONG; AND THE FIRST TRACK IS ALSO AWESOME. THE ALBUM JUST LOSES STEAM AFTER THAT. IF THE WHOLE ALBUM WERE LIKE THOSE SONGS IT WOULD GET 5 STARS BUT ITS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SONGS. ANYWAY, VERY GOOD ARTIST AND I AM SURE HE WILL MAKE GREAT MUSIC IN THE FUTURE.
B000002J1O|5.0|one of the best albums of the band and far away from the boring phase they have gone after Peter Gabriel left.

0688145078|5.0|My son is just barely 6 and will be a big brother in about 3 weeks.  I got this book to help prepare him for the arrival of his baby sister and it was a great purchase.  It has helped him understand that the baby will be pretty helpless for a while, and that he can help with the baby.  It also talks about how great it is to be the \\"big kid\\". It is a simple book that doesn't have a lot of pages.  It would definitely be appropriate for younger children.
B000050X31|1.0|I was decieved by a review at this site that made this into being one of the best DVDs out on the market. To clarify; It's not!!<br /><br />It begins ok, with an orchestra that is lively and playful, and a smiling Levine in the grave as always - but the the stage is set, and we find Tamino, who is supposed to be a teenager, as a greyhaired old man with no acting skills. He sing all right, but without feeling and nouance. Enter the three ladies; not bad at all... Then this disaster of a Papageno enters. My god! Is it possible? Emanuel Schickaneder made Mozart compose Papagenos arias so they would be easy to sing, so that he could take on this crowdpleaser role himself, but that was a peoples theater outside Vienna, this is the MET! Couldn't they find someone that could SING and ACT? No, no, no. The bottom line is that he doesn't come through the orchestra at all, and I suspect the people in the theatre heard even less of him.. Well well, enough of that, I thought this couldn't get any worse, but that was before the battle. Kathleen Battle, that is. Its no wonder that there were over 500 employees from the MET that bought the T-shirt with the text \\"I survived the Battle\\". Off stage she was rumored to be absolutely horrible to people. But enough of that; Her singing is not all that good either, and all the strange faces she makes while she sings; I mean, come on! How is anyone gonna belive that? Theres no room for acting when we clearly can see that the only thing she is thinking of is her next frase. Sorry! No points from me.<br /><br />The only thing in this DVD which is worth mentioning in the positive direction is the Sarastro's deep notes. That is truely amazing. His low notes are more strong in volume than any of his other notes. That was quite impressive.<br /><br />If there is one recording of the magic flute I recommend, it is Ingmar Bergman's production from 1974, wich was the breakthrough of Håkan Hagegaard as Papageno. If you can bear the swedish language, and get a good translation at a subtitle, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />PENCIER!anguage, and get a good translation at a subtitle, you are in for a treat.  <br /> <br />PENCIER!
0694013013|5.0|I read FROM HEAD TO TOE to my baby, who is now 10 months old, and to a good friend's child, who is about 22 months old. Both enjoy it!<br /><br />FROM HEAD TO TOE, like all of Eric Carle's books, offers multiple kinds of learning in one book. The first page shows a penguin saying \\"I am a penguin and I turn my head. Can you do it?\\" On the facing page, a girl has turned her heaed and answers, \\"I can do it!\\" We proceed through the book, going all the way down the body: head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, back, hips, knees, legs, foot, toes. At the same time, we meet an assortment of very appealing pictures of animals and learn their names: penguin, giraffe, buffalo, monkey, seal, gorilla, cat, crocodile, camel, donkey, elephant, and parrot.<br /><br />I love that in the last pairing, the child takes action first: \\"I am I and I wiggle my toe. Can you do it?\\" This is followed by a parrot who copies the child wiggling his toe and says, \\"I can do it! I can do it!\\"<br /><br />At our house, the 10-month-old is currently more inclined to enjoy the pictures, and is just starting to join in with the motions occasionally. The 22-month-old friend now joins in with many of the motions.<br /><br />This is another great Eric Carle book, and will be a great addition to any child's early book collection.
0689865384|5.0|this is the first trilogy ive ever read, and i simply loved it!!!! they were the first books over 300 pages that i read in less than 2 days!!! and we all know that in every book there are always those boring parts where you just want to stop reading, but in this book (and the other two as well) i hardly felt like i wanted to stop reading.... actually, i never felt like stop reading them.... they are just great!!! I highly recommend them....
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This was the first album I ever bought of Guns N'Roses. GN'R is now my second favorite band. This is a great album, but why only 14 songs? This album is missing some great songs such as: <br /> <br />Nightrain <br />Mr. Brownstone <br />Mama Kin <br />Bad Obsession <br />Get in the Ring <br />Breakdown <br />So Fine <br /> <br />and where the hell is Estranged? that's one of my favorite songs. This is an ok album if it's your first GN'R album. But I suggest don't waste your money on this and just buy Appetite for Destruction first, Then the Use Your Illusions, Then Lies, Then Live, Then the Spaghetti Incident.
1401307450|4.0|Anthony Kiedis is one amazing person with an amazing story to tell.  He has lead an interesting life of decadence and excess but learned humility.  He overcame so many obstacles to become what he is today.  I recommend this book to any RHCP fan, anyone who loves rock music or someone who has struggled in life, which is many of us.  He is an inspiration.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Owner of three Lamb of God CDs, and having been graced to see them live in Rochester, NY, I can say without hesitation that any track you hear will have you floored.  All metal fans must have this album in particular.   <br /> <br />Ashes of the Wake starts off with a nuclear reactor's worth of energy.  The drummer, Chris Adler, is impressive throughout with his skill and power, in particular on the double-bass.  Songs that lack in high tempo make up for it with clearly audible lyrics (still growled) and strong guitar riffs.  I can barely put into words what I feel when I hear this album.  You must hear it for yourself!  If you haven't heard LoG before, I recommend getting a higher-than-sample-rate quality bit before you decide whether or not to explore this band further.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Perfect!!!  Felicity Hoffman is so believable as a transgendered invidual that it was creepy.
B000EQ47HC|3.0|\\"Don't Look Back\\" is a deservedly killer single, but a fairly weak album. <br /> <br />The album really doesn't compare to their debut, and this is a classic example of a MAJOR sophomore slump. <br /> <br />It starts off with that amazing single, here sounding better than ever. The tasteful remastering brings back that warm 70's sound...dare I say \\"analog\\"?...and I rocked along to every guitar lick and drum break. <br /> <br />But to be honest, I couldn't tell you the name of any other song on the album. I listened through the whole thing, yet still, I couldn't recall ONE of them. <br /> <br />Now I know why: they're all fairly boring, unmemorable tunes. Lots of borrowing of stuff from the first album...not just sounds but melodies and guitar lines... <br /> <br />When I was a kid, I simply must have just played that first song over and over again, because I just didn't LIKE any of the other songs... <br /> <br />...and I still don't. <br /> <br />Here's the thing. It's still worth buying for two reasons. One, that one song is actually worth it. Two, the Boston \\"sound\\" is worth hearing in this pristine state, even if you won't be able to hum any of it afterwards...
B000FMGTTE|3.0|First of all, the prospect of taking on a film scoring assignment where the composer must make use of some of the most well known film themes in history is quite simply a thankless task.  That said, credit must be given to John Ottman for accepting the job of scoring and adapting John Williams' monumental themes for this summer's \\"Superman Returns,\\" and for doing a pretty good job with it all.  Film history is full of examples where earlier themes had to be woven into new scores.  Some worked and some did not.  Franz Waxman was stunned to have to weave his friend's, Alfred Newman's, themes from \\"The Robe\\" into his own adaptation for \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators.\\"  Waxman's efforts were triumphant.  David Arnold has done a fine job scoring the James Bond epics in the shadow of John Barry.  And more in tune with this subject, Ken Thorne did an outstanding job of adapting Williams' \\"Superman\\" themes for \\"Superman II.\\"  Truth be told Ottman did a better job with his scoring for \\"Superman Returns\\" than the producers, writers, and director did for the film itself.  Ottman's adaptations are fine, at least as good, if not better, than Thorne's efforts.  In fact, he actually adds some new emotional life to Williams' music in places (note especially \\"Memories,\\" and \\"Not Like the Train Set\\"), and his own music blends nicely with the adaptations.  Overall, the score works to enliven the film and give it musical roots.  It is also a very enjoyable soundtrack album.  For this we say \\"thanks\\"!  A good recording with some fun enhanced extras (do we really need these?) by Rhino/Wea., but a bit disappointing in the packaging.
B00005JLR2|4.0|\\"Treasure Planet\\" bombed at the box office and that's a shame because there is a lot to admire in this under-rated gem. The animation is top notch, the pacing is swift and the movie by and large avoids the treacly conventions that mar most Disney films. If your household is home to a young fan of Pixar features and the animated films of acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Myazaki, I think you will find this a Disney flick worth watching.
B00004NRWH|4.0|Before the whole rock sound of the 2000's that includes loud crunching guitars, mindless drum beating, and a lead singer screaming off the top of his lungs for long notes a la Defaut, Theory of a Deadman, Seether, Shinedown, Avenged Sevenfold, and countless others came the Canadian band Nickelback (who I consider the father of our new rock sound). <br /> <br />With grunge dying off in about 1995 led to a 4 year period of great alternative rock, which soon let to this crisp, somewhat over produced sound we have now. The State features some great songs, but some fillers as well, thus the following review: <br /> <br />By far the best song is \\"Breathe\\" at the #1 spot. Thankfully it was a single and continues to be a great singalong. <br /> <br />\\"Leader of Men\\" the 1st single by the band ever is jsut a step down. The slow beginning eventually picks up into a ruckus chorus. Good lyrics. <br /> <br />I would have to classify \\"Old Enough\\" into that filler status. As a radio single, I'd have picked something else because the song seems to be a repetive echo of itself and the lyrics aren't too great. <br /> <br />A bumpy ride with \\"Worthy to Say\\" ocillates w/ Chad's voice up and down throughout the song making it a rather nice roller coaster with a few intermissions here and there. <br /> <br />Nothing to special with \\"Diggin' This\\" either. Just another song to fit the bill. <br /> <br />\\"Deep\\" is rather deep with a Creedesque crunch w/ Chad's voice. <br /> <br />Thankfully \\"One Last Ride\\" shows up and you start to really rock to. An instant classic I'd have easily made into a single. It has an uptempo beat to it which lets you just jam out to any time. The drumming is what actually makes this a great song, with a nice solo along w/ some layered guitars. <br /> <br />I could have swear I was hearing a song by Silverchair (particulary \\"Freaks\\") with \\"Not Leavin' Yet\\". The song is eerily similar to the sound. I wonder if they sampled...hmmm...still since I like Silverchair, this is a good song. <br /> <br />Now \\"Hold Out Your Hand\\" might just be a filler if they didn't include that great repeating guitar crunch. <br /> <br />Finishing off is an acoustic version of \\"Leader of Men\\" which personally isn't as good as the other regular version, but since I guess they needed to plug that song in your skulls they included it here. <br /> <br />Not as over produced as their later albums, but still a great follow up to Curb (which actually was made in 96). Officially their first major release, State provides some of Nickelback's rawest and finest songs, but still some mindless fillers. <br /> <br />
037571457X|5.0|_Persepolis_ is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi's experiences as a young teen during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979.  While the drawings in the graphic novel are simple, the story is a moving one.<br /><br />Satrapi's observations and recollections are wry and witty, with a touch of the independence and recklessness of a teenager.  Growing up in an affluent family under the Shah, Satrapi was to some extent removed from the larger political issues that wracked Iran before the revolution, although her family was very involved in politics.  This of course changed as she matured, and as the revolution and war with Iraq began to effect her on a more personal level, with death of friends and family.<br /><br />But the novel is more than its parts - it demonstrates simply and clearly the complexity of life in Iran, especially after the revolution.  Many westerners (and Americans in particular) have a distinctive image of what Iran and the Middle East are.  Satrapi's story gives a human face the region, and addresses themes that transcend geography, culture and religion.  A recommended read.
B00004T8RK|5.0|It was \\"Light Years\\" that attracted me to this album more than any other song for it's simple undemanding drums, great bass, and a perfect lyrical ode. Eddie really has a knack to put out at least one great song on every album and this is the one for Binaural. <br /> <br />\\"Nothing As It Seems\\" which may appeal to any pearl jam fan, not only exemplifies great songwriting, but also turn back to clock dark, resonating, vibe via viatolgy with a more rock friendly atmosphere. <br /> <br />Other great songs include \\"Insignificance\\" which is like an anti-war song so to speak maybe, which has a nice chorus, and \\"Thin Air\\" is a slower more rich and deep song. <br /> <br />The first 2 songs, \\"Breakerfall\\" and \\"Evacuation\\" are also fun rock in your face Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />Binaural by no means is a blockbuster, but still should rank as one of their more listener friendly album. The album is really a complete listen from start to finish and the band really does show signs of moving on from their roots. Personally, it is my 2nd favorite behind Viatolgy. Perhaps more polished than No Code, and less stringent than Yield, and definately better songwriting than Riot Act. If you need to move on from earlier stuff, give this one a shot.
0385474547|5.0|_Things Fall Apart_ is the story of European colonialism from an African's perspective, and as the title implies, there is no happy ending.  Nonetheless, it is a fascinating glimpse into the antithesis of Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_.<br /><br />It is the story of Onknowo, an Ibo warrior who worked hard to be a success within his village, and the gradual, tragic destruction of his world.  Some of this is the result of matters beyond his control; some of this is the result of flaws within his own character; and of course, some of this \\"falling apart\\" is the result of the incursion of Europeans.  Okonkwo's story is a microcosom of the entire continent.  That \\"white people\\" are not exclusively (nor immeadiately) blamed for the wrongs that are done to the main character is indicitive of the larger issues facing modern Africa.  Yes, colonialism is responsible for many of Africa's problems.  But many of Africa's problems are the result of the actions of Africans themselves.<br /><br />For some, the frequent use of Ibo words may be a challenge - I was fortunate enough in my copy to have a glossary included to help with that.  For others, the vivid description of West African culture may be difficult - I found it refreshing and very interesting.<br /><br />It is a short read (my edition was less than 150 pages), but very worthwhile.  Highly recommended.
B00005B4GU|5.0|To really be a skeptic of radio head they first have to put out bad music, but since they never really have, then there shouldn't be any haters to \\"Amnesiac\\", the similar sounding follow up to \\"Kid A\\". <br /> <br />It'd almost make sense to package both the albums together as I believe most of the songs were written around the same time and knowing \\"Amnesiac\\" was released just a year after \\"Kid A\\", but this is what we got. <br /> <br />\\"Packt Like Sardines in a Tin Can\\" gives you the image that someone really is in a sardine can w/ the pulsating popping of metal and that reverberating beat box and synthesizer. A nice beginning to the album. <br /> <br />I'd put \\"Pyramid Song\\" as one of the best songs on the album with the non-rock, non-guitar, but haunting ehcos, forceful piano/keyboards and Thom's soothing vocals puts you in a trance unlike no other.  <br /> <br />Perhaps a nuisance rather than a song comes with \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\". Entirely electronics of syblimanal messages relives something of \\"Fitter Happier\\" on LSD in a long 4min adventure. <br /> <br />Meloncholy \\"You and Whose Army\\" brings us a taste for \\"Hail to the Thief\\" for its rich and lush vocals and tropical soft riffs with a jazzy flare of drums and piano.\\" <br /> <br />Guitar roots still found in \\"I Might Be Wrong.\\" Memories of \\"The Bends\\" but with a trippy beat. <br /> <br />\\"Knives Out\\", another single I believe, is my favorite song with a gutsy wave of acoustic guitar and some great electric and bass guitars. Matched by some great sounding vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is slower, more forceful, and tripier than that on \\"Kid A\\". This version in my opinion is not better, and perhaps could be left off, but still nice to hear another version. <br /> <br />Another great is \\"Dollars and Cents\\" which is my 2nd fav. The pace is somewhat moderate, with a sort of string/synthesizer, bass guitar, and drum mix plays nicely to the tempo. <br /> <br />2minutes of a Hindrix type guitar and soft keyboards comes with \\"Hunting Bears\\" with no vocals. A great song to think to if nothing else. <br /> <br />\\"Like Spinning Plates\\" starts like some spacey alien abuduction reverb sound wigh Thom finally settling down some studio mixed vocals almost halfway in the song. Not bad though. <br /> <br />Finishing with \\"Life in a Glass House\\" pleases your earlobes w/ some a great jazzy blues song of horns, woodwinds, drums, and piano that only radiohead could pull off. <br /> <br />Slightly less in quality of songs compared to \\"Kid A\\" and not commercially successful as \\"OK Computer\\" but still a great lineup of genuinely unique songs.
B00005JMCN|5.0|The matching white casts worn by spunky Seabiscuit and anger-in-motion jockey Red Pollard (Toby Maguire) near the end of this beautiful movie remind us that the story it tells is not about a horse. Nor is it, as some have alleged, just about the people with the horse standing in as equine eye candy.<br /><br />It's about both. Two white casts. Two stories of healing from the pits of disposability, anger, hopelessness. 'We all get a little banged around', Jeff Bridges' elegantly acted character tells us.<br /><br />Seabiscuit is a feast for the eyes, for the ears, and for the heart.<br /><br />An historian who writes like David McCullough should not be allowed to have a voice like that. It's not fair.  And it's the first human sound you hear in this superbly crafted movie. It lends a true-to-life frame to the move, one that the soundtrack leads you to intermittently, so that you don't forget: something like this really happened, and not that long ago. The Great Depression was a defining moment for this country - ignoring for just one moment the rest of this interconnected world - and it lives on as the wolf at the door for those who know those who knew what it meant in shattered lives and down-the-drain assumptions about hard work and its expected fruits.<br /><br />A little horse with an attitude came along just at the right moment to show people stuck in life's mosh pits that there might be more to the story. It's about the future, Jeff Bridges' 'Mr Howard' tells us, seeming quite naïve at times, except for the now obvious fact that he was right.<br /><br />The story has its poetry and its music. Randy Newman manages a score that is at once sonorous and understated, perfectly complementing the horse and its people without once intruding on the foreground, where it does not belong.<br /><br />The casting is superb: Bridges' upside-down thoughtful scowl is humanized by the light in his eyes. He carries his pain around in a heart that can still respond. He also bears his privilege lightly, becoming the target of a greater number of metaphorical slaps on the butt from common people without seeming to mind, or even to notice.<br /><br />That's the poetry, someone says, as he watches the Biscuit run. But it's on the human side of the rail too, in this sympathetic film.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire as the too-tall jockey. Red Pollard distinguishes himself in a serious film, and Cooper's character is magic. When Cooper's Tom Smith talks to a horse and Newman's score gently merges sound with sight, you realize you're in the hands of craftsmen who are unlikely to disappoint. And they don't, pulling this story off in a way that justifies the accolades it received.<br /><br />Elizabeth Banks' Marcela.  Aah. Are there actually women this beautiful at thirty, or is that just lights and mirrors?  A check of her filmography shows that the toothy girl-next-door unselfconsciousness of her persona is real, natural, and perhaps ever so slightly lamented as a determiner of the kinds of roles that come her way. No matter, Lizzy. Just keep doing what you do.<br /><br />Arguably, the best wide scene in the movie occurs at Santa Anita Park, I believe, when the camera catches the infield crowd running for angle, a scene you can only truly appreciate if you've experienced public pandemonium and the momentary glimpse of chaos that it offers.<br /><br />What a movie.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The bonus material on this DVD is amazing. It lived up to my expectations. If you're a fan of this movie, I highly suggest you buy this special edition.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Loved the CD. Robbie Williams is still making great music with interesting lyrics as well fun easy to listen to pop.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Songs like \\"Your Song\\", \\"Elephant Love Medley\\", and \\"Come What May\\" make this soundtrack. The more crappy ones like \\"Lady Marmalade\\" don't. If you're going to buy this CD, I suggest you buy the second Moulin Rouge soundtrack which includes the amazing end credits song \\"Bolero\\", many instrumental background music pieces, and songs like \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"The Pitch\\" which were fun songs in the movie which shouldn't have been left out of this CD.
1401302378|5.0|This book is the perfect introduction not just to the long tail itself, but also how it is changing are culture and the way we do business.  If you're not familiar with the long tail, it is simply the part of a demand curve after it slopes down past the blockbusters, chart-topers, or otherwise popular goods or services and then drags on seemingly forever representing the demand for niche goods or services.  The bottom line for business is that the combined sales for these niches can add up to rival or even overtake the sales of the chart-toppers.         Traditionally, due to limited shelfspace, showtimes, broadcast channels, etc, companies have been forced to chop the tail off somewhere.  But now, online stores like Amazon, ebay, itunes, and Rhapsody, have the capacity to offer a much greater variety of product. They can simply let the tail grow as long as it wants and profit greatly from the hits and niche sales.          Chris Anderson was no where near the first to discover the long tail, but his book very clearly articulates dymanics that effect the long tail and how the long tail effects our culture and businesses.  This book is the ideal jump-off point for anyone who is not yet familiar with how the long tail is, and will continue to, impact our everyday lives and culture.
B000060OFT|4.0|I bought this movie because I loved Moulin Rouge. I definitely would watch it again. I thought it was well made. It's not my favorite movie, but I did like it and it's worth watching.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I'm 46 and my wife is 52.  She doesn't care for 'screamo' metal bands and she wasn't down with the the other two A7X albums.<br /><br />When I played this she was amazed. The new style of vocals really appealed to her AND TO ME!.  I LOVE THIS ALBUM.<br /><br />It's a bit Metallica, some-what Iron Maiden; the vocals are a bit like Queen (says the wife) or someone I just can't nail down.<br /><br />Doesn't matter.  This and Wolfmother are my fave albums of new tunes so far this year.<br /><br />Eagles of Death Metal is #3!
0790731452|3.0|I saw this movie several years ago, and thought that it was really funny, but after recently buying and re-watching it, I couldn't really remember why I liked it so much. There is lots of quirky humor and unexpected plot turns (like what defeats the Martians), but nothing to celebrate about. I appreciate the fact that it is Tim Burton's, and I also feel that having most of the enormous (and very famous) cast die was a brave thing to do, but the movie as a whole just isn't that spectacular. I suggest renting it before buying it.
0345457692|5.0|I have read a lot of science fiction in the last 40 years, and I have a passion for CyberPunk so finding a good book is a joy. Finding a new author is like finding treasure. Morally ambiguous characters, odd technology, post-information society, social despotism, and large caliber handguns! The internal narrative voice-over adds nicely to the neon-splashed visions. The tone and tenor of the writing blends styles across many hundreds of years from Gulliver's Travels to dectetive noir. Many lines can be read as 'homage' rather than text and that adds to the post-information blended quality of the world that is the backdrop. The story line is neither straightforward nor linear, but always moves along the tracks toward some not-so-clear conclusion.<br /><br />This is a fully-formed world at all scales, from interplanetary politics to virtual porn. Read a book, be a book. This book is a nice place to be and should be considered a CyberPunk standard.
B00005JP01|4.0|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift isn't a deep, thought provoking movie, but it doesn't purport to be either.  It's just what it was marketed in trailers to be: an action packed fun bit of mind candy filled with fast cars, dozens upon dozens of hot Japanese girls, thumping music, and body flinching car crashes.  The basic plot is that a high school driving nut gets in trouble (yet again) after racing with a rich boy.  To keep him out of jail, he is sent to his estranged father in Japan.  Alas, there he discovers the world of drifting, an even more dangerous style of racing.  Unfortunately, he also soon finds himself in trouble with the relative of a high ranking Yakuza.<br /><br />For me, the only really noticeable mistake in this movie is that way too many people walked away with only a few scratches from what should have been fatal crashes.  For example, there is one crash where a car rams into a concrete tube while going at least 80 mph.  Yet the two occupants didn't even require a hospital bed!  A more minor mistake might have been putting in a little too much plot, especially when some things weren't followed up as well as they could have.  In the end, though, the plot is mostly there to serve as some spacer between all the hot cars and awesome races.  I should mention one other minor mistake.  Vin Diesel's cameo was so completely pointless.  The movie already had a good ending, it was just kinda senseless.<br /><br />The cars in this movie are the real stars.  So many hot little numbers, including American muscle cars, hot foreign vehicles, and one pimped out van that you just have to see to believe.  The acting is good, for what it is, though Luca Black's twang-filled voice might annoy some folks.  Twinkie, another army brat played by Bow Wow, is such a hoot!  I know I said the plot was mostly spacer, but I did find the interaction between Sean, Han, and Twinkie to be awesome.<br /><br />So I suggest you don't think about the logistics of things.  Just sit back and enjoy the cars, the some times over-the-top characters, and, for the men (or lesbians) the multitude of Japanese girls who barely wear any clothes. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised that they attempted to include at least some true elements of Japanese culture, such as the changing shoes thing in schools.<br /><br />I do recommend this one been seen in the theater.  The music and pulse of the movie are made for big screen, surround sound viewing!  I might get this one DVD just to have something fun and rocking to watch when I want some mindless action.Just sit back and enjoy the cars, the some times over-the-top characters, and, for the men (or lesbians) the multitude of Japanese girls who barely wear any clothes.

0553801503|2.0|If I knew Mr. Martin, and he'd given me this to read before publication, I would have said, \\"George, what are you doing?  Why are you beginning the 4th novel in this series with 3 chapters focusing on new supporting characters that no one is familiar with?  In sequels people want to encounter some familiar characters right away.  THEN you can introduce the minor characters you want to add into the plot. Please, George.  Also,put Tyrion Lannister in somewhere. Your readers LOVE that character!  Cersei Lannister isn't a sympathetic or enjoyable character to read about, and waaaaay too much of the book focuses on her.\\"<br /><br />Alas, I don't know George R.R. Martin at all.  This book was a chore to read, and I don't know if I'm going to come back for the 5th installment.
B000002GWN|5.0|Of all of the concerts that I have attended in and around LA, this was the one that leaves me with a smile and a tear. That it was Joni Mitchell, and the lovely lady with me. It was cold out, that night. This was when there was no roof over the place(Always thought that it lost something after the roof). Joni turned in a solid performance,along with the backup band.Considering how much she scaled back her live appearances after, it was a priviledge to be there.How much better the story would have been,had I married whom I was with.
B000007VCM|5.0|As a longtime U2 fan, I believed that there was precious little else in the mid-80's. But this CD proved me wrong. While this is clearly an 80's production with all the sheen of the era, these songs are far stronger and diverse in scope. Not a bad song on the disc either. \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" was the biggest hit (and still gets airplay!), but in reality most of the songs are even better.  <br /> <br />Buy this CD, and forget about all the weak, contrived crap the 80's usually gave us. And give your U2 CD's a rest...
B000EULJLU|5.0|first i have to say that this is a fantastic album, i don't know if it's better than lateralus or aenima but it's just different, for me their best is lateralus but its something in this album i can't stop to listen to. <br />this cd satisfy me in each way for his complex and darkness, it's like a film you have to listen to from begin to the end, no separate songs. <br />the highlights are vicarious(uhhh one of the best tool songs), the beautiful wings for marie pt 1 and pt2, lost keys-rosetta stoned and intension-right in two... i like a lot this so called filler songs that they put before a long song. <br />finally they are in continuous evolution and i will be very happy if in their next album they satisfy me like with this 10000 days.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This is definitely a great album.  Better than most out there.  BUT, for those that said this is better than anything radiohead has ever done, get your retarded head out of your arse.  Muse is much more accessible to listeners, but that moment you truly get radiohead is an experience that only radiohead can provide.  This is not to take away from muse because this is a great piece of work.
B000000WJZ|5.0|There are no words to describe this album, you have to buy this if you are a alternative music fan. billy corgan is the most amazing guatarist of the 90's, now i understand that kurt cobain and nirvana's \\"nevermind\\" was a huge cd and everything, but really whos a better musician kurt cobain or billy corgan? you tell me after listening to siamese dream and nevermind, but dont get me wrong i love nirvana but people need to know that the smashing pumpkins were a more talented band during that time.
B000002UCN|4.0|There's no other George Harrison or even close. His music lives on. And he lives on in my heart. Buy this and everything else by the Beatles. For me I'd rather buy this stuff twice than the new artist clones that flood the market today. <br />Capitol will get around to reissues hopefully before all the first generation Beatle fans are dead. <br />That goes for the Capitol Album remasters too. <br />Capitol... are you listening ?... <br />Dave
0790729628|4.0|Film editors play an important role. They help enhance the story by making edits in just the right places, and some are masters of their craft. This movie \\"felt\\" much more like a Sci-Fi Bogart Noir with Harrison Ford's P.I. style voiceover, which has been absent from the only available DVD version for nearly a decade now. Instead, we are served up some obtuse surrealistic mythological imagery, and drawn out silences at what is supposed to be the climax and denoument of the film.    Save your money until the theatrical version of this Cinematic Masterpiece is finally re-released.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Pitiful. Moore's comments on the film are justified. His story of facism, Orwell-ion society and supression of the masses has been turned into a liberal social agenda designed to try and attack the world today when in reality the material has nothing to do with our current society. And thats where it failed. I wanted to see an adaptation of one of Moore's master-works, not someone elses take on the subject and characters, twisting a classic of the genre into thier own creation. Don't waste your time. Read the book. You'll be smarter for it.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|I just purchased this 2013 remaster set and it's even more amazing that I remember it.  Starless is just DEVASTATING.  The heaviest thing I have ever heard both musically and emotionally. Unbelievable. I think Wetton was right, they were on the cusp of something big when Robert walked away and &#34;wrecked your favorite train set&#34; (Bruford).  One can see how Bruford would have been upset, he gave up a lot to join King Crimson.<br /><br />When I used to pop this little goody on the turn-table in my dormitory at Seattle Pacific College - A &#34;Christian&#34; University.  I believe my dorm-mates thought me possessed by Beelzebub himself.  Fallen Angel?<br /><br />I picked this up as an import prior to the US release at a recordshop in the University district.  I walked from Queen Ann hill across the Fremont Bridge to go and get it.  That was in the fall of 1974.  It's a brilliant recording but it was hard to listen to back then, knowing there would be no supporting tour. Every track is superb and HEAVY - even the spooky Providence (Stockhausen meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  That one had me wondering whether I really was, you know...<br /><br />All three studio release by Crimson Mk IV were superb, each one was different yet you knew it was Crimso.  Red is a fantastic swansong for this lineup.  Buy now.
0930289234|5.0|We knew from the start that the medium that birthed the genre would ultimatley be the one to bear it's judgement. I have always had a vested interest in comics, but this just altered everything. I am a convert and a believer now that the medium is capable of things that only this book has ever come close to.<br /><br />Along with this, I pruchased DKR, and I find that to be a highly overrated book. While it felt rushed, Watchmen was well drawn out, giving you time to choose the characters you care about, while DKR relyed more on common knowledge to move the story of batman. A first-comer wouldn't understand by DKR's quick-moving story about his past with the Joker, with his parents murder or what truly drives him. But Watchmen starts the slate clean and lets you pick and choose with a story that is as relevant today as ever. Though dont get me wrong, DKR is a FANTASTIC book (there are still parts I have a hard time reading, like the ridley baby rescue and the woman in the subway), but DKR only encompassed a character, while Watchmen, an industry.<br /><br />I've read alot of books in my life, but this has topped everything. I've never read it's equal. From the symbolism, to the plot twists. The way the smiley face keeps appreating, the way the Comedian almost becomes a true COMEDIAN for the world(\\"I never said it was a GOOD joke\\", \\"professional jealousy\\"). Moore stands alone as a writer, and frank miller could take some hints from him. The irony and details discovered after several reads are truly rewarding, like the fact that even though it's based on the violent superheros comics of the past fifty+ years, it is arguably light on violence (minus the first pages of \\"A stronger loving world\\") and relies more on a detective-like story, and the only SUPERhero with powers is the introverted, alienated Jon Osterman.<br /><br />The last question we are left with is also the last line in the book, and involves the ultimate plot of the story. It is left \\"entirley in our hands\\" to decide if the good of the many outweigh the good of the few (NO SPOILERS).<br /><br />If made into a faithful movie, which I would only trust in the hands of Terry Gilliam, it stands to hold rank as one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />Who watches the watchmen? Me for one.

B00005221M|5.0|Yesterday I browsed through my wallets of DVDs and chanced upon Michael Mann's expanded edition of The Last of the Mohicans. Hadn't watched it for a while, so I thought 'why not?' Hadn't seen it for a year or so. And now I'm going to rant about it.<br /><br />If there's anything I regret with regards to movie-watching, it's that, when it came out in NZ in 1992--I think--we were too strapped for cash to afford going to the movies. Also, it didn't last that long, for some incomprehensible reason. As a result I missed out on seeing this movie on the big screen, and when I finally picked it up in VHS years ago, it was like 'damn, damn, damn!' It still is.<br /><br />If ever there was a movie that qualified as having just about everything your heart might desire--and if you are that way disposed, of course--it's TLotM; and the slightly expanded director's edition, though hated by some, is, overall, a much better film than the cinema release. I think so anyway. If you look at some reviews, you'll find some vehemently differing opinions.<br /><br />The movie starts with the most 'architectural' and sweeping of its tunes--and an amazing soundtrack it is!--and a large and incredibly elegant title.<br /><br />The title sets the tone for the movie; which is large and in your face and unapologetically romantic, tragic, grandiose; vast in scope, subtext and context, yet tightly focused on its characters, almost all of which manage to get fleshed out to the extent that we end up 'knowing' all, even the 'bad guy'.<br /><br />The cinematography is often leisurely and sweeping, and always at the same time beautiful, yet unintrusive, unlike some other instances of 'great cinematography', where it either subtitutes for story or occasionally destroys it. This here reminded me of Ridley Scott and 'The Duellists'; which, if you haven't seen it, you really ought to.<br /><br />After this brooding, yet peaceful opening, we follow a deer hunt by the three 'last Mohicans', one of whom is a white child, adopted by the eldest of the three.<br /><br />Back to the picturesque, stately and elegantly misplaced in this frontier world.<br /><br />If anybody ever managed seamless integration of story and truly great imagery; well, here's the best example I can think of.<br /><br />Based on James Fenimore Cooper's story--which I read, long time ago, in my teens, the full version, though translated into German--but freely adapted and modified to fit the medium, and thereby made into a better, richer story, LotM gives us a few movie-'greatest'.<br /><br />For one, it has the...the word is 'hot'...one of the hottest love scenes ever. No words and not a shred of clothes coming off; at least not that we see. But there's more sex and romance in this one scene than most movies pack into their entire length.<br /><br />It also has the most breathless, panicky and edge-of-your seat rescue-the-girl sequence ever, pushed along in perfect rhythm by a score that's got to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />All that is set in the context of the battle between England and France for the Americas; with the Indians either becoming exterminated or else corrupted; not necessarily by alcohol but simple greed.<br /><br />And the monologue by Chingachcook at the end--which does not appear in the theatrical version--is a sad summary of the inevitability of the future and what it brings. Not a condemnation, but acceptance of what is inexorable, and a summary of the human condition, individual, social and historical.<br /><br />Ultimately it is a lament for the disappearance of something we all fear, yet yearn for, and will openly or secretly, depending on our disposition, mourn after it has vanished: that strange thing known as a 'frontier'.<br /><br />There are no villains in this movie. Not even the colonial powers are actually condemned. People do what they do for reasons perfectly valid to themselves; and what they do will appear to them--and if we accepted their assumptions, it would to us also!--as if it were perfectly sensible and justifyable. The colonials and the Indians all ultimately exhibit the same traits, strengths and limitations.<br /><br />Magua, the 'bad guy' of the piece, also is not really 'bad', but rather twisted by contingency and predisposition and a yearning of revenge that gets out of hand; though, of course, for him and within the context of his culture, it is a perfectly sensible way to react to what had been done to him. Still, he's not a nice person; and ultimately he is psychologically defeated and effectively humiliated by the weakest of the protagonists, and killed shortly thereafter by a man whose motive, like Magua's, is revenge. There's irony galore. Still, there's a savage kind of satisfaction when Magua finally falls.<br /><br />Ultimately--or maybe it depends on one's disposition--LotM is ineffably sad; for though the characters at the heart of the movie survive and presumably will raise a family of their own, they also will have to change into something else than what were when they first appeared on the scene. Something has to go, so something else can start.<br /><br />An amazing film that never ceases to grab me. I can only imagine what my reaction would have been seeing it on a big screen, and for the first time. Alas, some things cannot be; and this is one of them.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com.epted their assumptions, it would to us also!--as if it were perfectly sensible and justifyable.

B0006L16N8|5.0|After having had Coldplay's X&Y for quite a while i re-listened to it again recently.  it is brilliant, powerful, moving, transcendent.  if you disagree, you're wrong, or a metalhead.
B000001ESF|5.0|It begins with '2112' a 20 minute song that takes up 'side-one' of the CD. '2112' has classical-like song structure and at the end of the '2112 Overature' explosions are heard in space - homage to the cannon fire at the end of Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overature'. This was the last Rush CD to be in good part 'metal' music and arguably the last Rush CD to have a less accomplished sound. The song 2112 tho has a SF/technical sound and doesn't really sound dated. 2112 does sound tense and angry. Neil Peart must have wore out 3 sets of drum skins recording the overature alone, pretty amazing. Many people like the slow 'Soliloquy' movement on 2112. It may be the most genuinley sad moment Rush has ever captured, - \\"I wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams, just think of what my life might be in a world like I have seen\\" and Rush have done melancholy well over the years.    On 'side-two', the sad song 'Tears' is good and so is a single on the CD 'The Twilight Zone'. Rush's previous CD 'Caress of Steel' was dedicated to \\"the memory of Rod Serling\\" who had passed. A number of musicians would go on to record songs about The Twilight Zone, The Manhatten Transfer having a hit. Rush have had a number of their really good singles, like The Twilight Zone, just never see airplay. Many of these songs haven't really been featured on their compilations or on their live CDs either. Bacchus Plateau, Circumstances, Middletown Dreams, Speed of Love, and some others, all have been really nice. Perhaps it's a nice treat for the buyer when they take these CDs home and discover them.    This was the first CD I ever bought. All I knew was that a friend of mine liked Rush. When I listened to it I thought it was cool, and it was like nothing I'd heard before. Why wasn't I hearing this on the radio? I wondered. This is just like the story of the charcter in 2112, who, in the year 2112, discovers a guitar and expects to be sainted. Only to find the ruling class isn't interested - \\"Yes we know, it's nothing new, just a waste of time. We have no need for ancient ways, our world is doing fine\\". My real world, is just like the world of the guy in 2112. Wow man
0446677450|1.0|I've read this book and come across Kiyosaki on tv as well. All I can say is that I completely back the reviewer who posted before me. I've even decided to investigate Kiyosaki online. A quick web search will quickly deflate the hype that this book is. Save your time and avoid the hype.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Every song on \\"Broken Boy Soldier\\" is great! The songs have a British 60s feel (Beatles, Led Zeppelin)in a timeless sort of way.  The CD sounds like \\"classic rock\\" and it is hard to imagine the songs are newly written. I checked it out after seeing the online video and purchased it on because of my faith in Jack White.  Everything he touches turns to gold, yet he's not the frontrunner in this CD.  It appears as truly a collaborative effort with Jack Lawrence (bass), Patrick Keeler (drums), Brendan Benson (vocals, guitar). Don't listen to the so-so reviews.  I love this CD!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|I bough this CD with the hopes that it would be great. After all, the two singles that came out on the radio (Sorry, Hung Up) were awesome. The rest of the songs, though????? Not so much. I was incredibly disappointed to find that those two songs were the only ones I liked. And, I already can hear those for free. The other songs were just boring beats and lyrics that were either spoken word (weird) or when sung, they weren't sung well. I have only listened to it all the way through once, and don't even remember where I put it after. That was a few weeks ago....Needless to say, I haven't looked for it. Seems to me that, just like her concerts, this CD was way over-priced. Not worth it at all. Buy the single
B00008WT5C|5.0|One of AC/DC's best - if underappreciated - efforts. Raw, with an immediacy not heard in today's polished and manipulated rock. The remastered AC/DC albums are clearer, with greater definition and power. Highly recommended.
B00005JP0A|4.0|Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's \\"She-Devil\\" and 1992's \\"Death Becomes Her\\", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.<br /><br />Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous \\"Miami Rhapsody\\", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of \\"Sex in the City\\" and \\"Entourage\\". He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep-dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers.<br /><br />The plot's protagonist is not Priestly but Andy Sachs, a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from Northwestern. Even though she has no interest in fashion, she lands an interview at Runway. Because she is not a typically bootlicking, anorexic fashionista toady, Priestly hires her as her second assistant. It becomes a nightmarish trial by fire, as Andy slowly earns the trust of Priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant Emily. And despite the derision of her circle of friends, including her live-in boyfriend, Sachs starts to respect Priestly's style and power, which leads to the decision to have Andy go to Paris for Fashion Week. Further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at Runway.<br /><br />It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should. Although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone's standards, the naturally likable Anne Hathaway plays Sachs serviceably and looks sensational in a series of Chanel outfits. She brings the necessary heart to the story, even though the character arc is rather predictable. It does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character's reduction from size 6 to 4, but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film.<br /><br />There is terrific work from the reliable Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's no-nonsense fashion director, especially as he patiently works under Priestly's shadow and gives Sachs hard-to-take survival advice, and from Emily Blunt, who plays first assistant Emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation. Overly metrosexualized with the strangest blond eyebrows I have ever seen, Simon Baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer Christian Thompson. Far less interesting are Sachs' judgmental friends, in particular, Adrian Grenier as Sachs' sous-chef boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms as art gallery manager Lilly (whose putdown of Andy seems way out of line). The ending is inevitable, but it moves in a creative way that makes neither Sachs overly heroic nor Priestly absolutely villainous. This is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of Streep.It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should.

B000FGGE68|3.0|Milla Jovovich was superb, the poise, the grace, the presence, as always, incomparable.  The grace in the actions scenes was superior to what can be seen in world class ballet.<br /><br />Oh yes, everything else...  The story was choppy, with elements that deserved greater development being dropped in like a snippet of another script.  This was most obvious with the 'Blood Chinois' gang.  Clearly there were relationships that had no connection to the rest of the story.  The head bad guy, Vice Cardinal Daxus was... well, a cartoon overstatement of a bad politician.  Understandable, given that this movie was derived from a comic book, but it would have taken so little effort to tone him down, making him twice as believible and three times as menacing.  The CGI and computer generated effects were spotty.  The aerial approach to the ministry looked like a last minute, slapped together change, but the motorcycle chase had bits that were pretty good.<br /><br />OK, the action had some merit.  Milla was the merit, everything else had the texture of the second rate Hong Kong martial arts movies of thirty years ago.  The sword fight with flaming swords was pretty cool and even made sense in context, but other than that, there wasn't much that wasn't done better in \\"Matrix\\" (you knew the comparison was coming, didn't you?).<br /><br />A special person note to the graphics guys;  We get it.  You have a thing for the biohazard logo, the radiation trifoil, and crosses.  We get it.  You were inserting symbolism as a dangle for the artsy crowd.  This stuff works much better when it is not bludgeoning the viewer.  For pete's sake, every muzzle blast from Violet's SMG was a biohazard logo, OK already! She's a carrier of a blood-borne pathogen, we get it!  Ummm, and you don't want to overdo the symbolism...<br /><br />This was worth watching once, as a rental.
B00005631D|5.0|This recording reminds me of my college days and I consider it as one of my \\"Desert Island CDs.\\"<br /><br />This is my number one choice as the BEST from all of Eumir Deodato's recordings. He has gained a worldwide recognition as one of the greatest artists in the history of jazz and has earned 16 Platinum Records to his credit. This album is a testament of his extraordinary talent not only in arranging and composing but also as a keyboard player, vocalist and percussionist all rolled-into-one.<br /><br />My highlights include \\"Take The A Train\\" and three of his very own compositions \\"Tahiti Hut,\\" which features himself on keyboards and synthesizers, congas, percussion and vocals; a lovely tune \\"San Juan Sunset\\" features a fine guitarist, Larry Carlton, playing acoustic and electric guitar; and the fascinating title track \\"Love Island.\\" Here you will appreciate the exquisite guitar solo of George Benson, one of the best guitarists America ever produced. (I can't wait to be at his concert with Al Jarreau at the Hollywood Bowl this August).<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this CD not only for Deodato fans but also to jazz buffs who truly enjoy great jazz music as performed to perfection by talented and gifted artist such as Eumir Deodato.<br /><br />Timeless music to enjoy forever!
B0006L0LOS|3.0|I am a little suprised by people's reactions to this film, though I guess I shouldn't be. Nice camera work, solid acting and direction. Special effects were weak - the CGI Catwoman was simply not as smooth as we have come to expect. The script was patterened around the original Catwoman comics (at least as I remember it) and likely is too pedestrian for today's audiences. <br />THis film is by now means a 'disaster', however, it was quite entertaining. Just not aimed at anyone who thought 'Team America' was anything other than complete garbage.
0375703861|3.0|I was on page 186 when I finally realized what this book was about and once I did, though it intrigued me a bit, I was ultimately disappointed. I give this book a three because the author's voice was mature and the characters were deep and complex. The story's road map was confusing at times and often wondered who and what the story was really about. The ending actually seemed rushed, especially with Irie having sex with the twin brothers and nothing ever developing further, except a pregnancy. Another positive was the rich dialogue of all the cultures involved: Jamaican, British, Indian.
0800105141|5.0|We are not perfect, but if we decide to do better than what has been the norm for humanity, we can. Gandhi chose to be a better man than he was and through his will power, guided but not blinded by his convictions, he embarked on a life that led him to challenge accepted notions on many aspects of our lives. He was creative, asking questions others did not ask and inventing answers others did not offer, with respect to problems we still face. And then he lived by what he discovered. He did not let his fears control him, but rather experimented with his own life to try out those answers. He sought the \\"truth\\" and tried to live by it. Above all, he tried to be honest with himself and with others. He tried not to inflict suffering, while also not allowing it to be accepted.  <br />He was not a supreme, magical being. He was not a saint. He was one more human being. He just slowly, sequentially, and then decidedly chose to find and follow whatever the truth may be, within a path of love and acceptance for fellow human beings.  <br />Most of us focus on the negative side of human nature. Most have no real faith in humanity. Here, though, is proof that we can do better.  <br />There is hope for us. But hope exists only if there is willingness to steadfastly, stubbornly, but DEFINITELY NOT CLOSED-MINDEDLY work for it. <br />I recommend this movie for teenagers and young adults, after an introduction to the history that led to the conditions in Ganghi's India, and the ideas permeating Western politics and ethics in that era. <br />To anyone wishing to understand his psyche more fully, I'd recommend his autobiography:  <br />THE STORY OF MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH
B00004Z459|3.0|O.k. before I get started, I refuse to classify this CD as metal. I'm just going to call it how I think it is and say it's Industrial. Sorry if that's a problem for some of you but when people call this album metal, it makes my skin crawl.  <br /> <br />Now that I've gotten that out of my system, onto the review. Linkin Park's debut CD \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was a bit of a change on rock radio because it was one of few Industrial/Rock CD's that saw air time on Top 40 radio and rock radio. It was quite a bit of a change than the usual norm when it comes to rock on Top 40 radio but for the time when it came out, it was a good thing.  <br /> <br />O.k. now the reason on why I refuse to call these guys metal is not because of their radio success but it's because they don't use a drummer or bassist and use a quintent consisting of 1 guitar, 1 drummer and 3 DJ/samplers. On \\"Hybrid Theory\\" the guys  show some promise as 2 what they could do with a line up as unconventional as this. For what it is worth and to their credit, their heavier songs like \\"Papercut\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\" are good songs. The mixture of guitars and sampling on these songs are represented very well on these tracks.  <br /> <br />The vocals on this album are also a mixture of screaming and even some rapping. Honestly, I didn't have a problem with that at all. I guess it works because they have 3 guys taking on 3 separate vocal roles (lead vocalist Chester Bennington, backing vocalist Joseph Hahn and emcee Mike Scmoda). My only gripe about the vocals is that on \\"In the End\\" and \\"Crawling\\" the vocals are just a little whiny at best and droning altogether. Sorry but these 2 tracks just bore me to sleep.  <br /> <br />All in all, I give \\"Hybrid Theory\\" a 3.5. Even though Amazon won't let me give a half rating and normally mathematical principles would force me to round up to 4, I'm still going to round down to 3 on the Amazon rating scale. I admit it is a little on the lame side that I dothis on the basis that this isn't a true metal album or even rap/metal album. Sorry folks but for those of you who are musically inclined, that statement should ring some truth there. Again still a good CD, just don't expect metal.
B00008DDXC|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining. After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large, which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch. <br /> <br />It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry, Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out? <br /> <br />All the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career, Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book, has hardly anything to do here except get petrified. <br /> <br />There were other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression. <br /> <br />Special features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called \\"Colin Creevey's Darkroom\\" where you can select pictures of various characters, then play them in a slideshow of sorts. <br /> <br />Apparently there's a whole stack of stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series. <br /> <br />All in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first.
0783225725|3.0|This classic western deserves better than the studio gave. The digital transfer is very disappointing. There are dust, sploches and other artifacts that should have been \\"cleaned up\\" before releasing this DVD.     The film itself is enjoyable as ever, but the poor quality of the transfer is distracting. The studio should redo this.    Edit: If you have any doubts about the quality of the transfer watch the restored version of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. There is no comparison.

B000002A3T|5.0|First of all, it's time to draw the line: It really cheeses me off when people find lame reasons to bash this album like \\"behind the Gilmour singing, the tunes are simple and boring\\". What's the big deal with Roger Waters solo stuff?. He left the band in 1983, after releasing what I call his first solo album (and his best): The Final Cut. Ever since he hasn't wrote even a decent album, awful singing and terrible waste of talent. I'm not saying he's a disposable and forgettable artist. He was such an outstanding songwriter, singer and musician when he was in the band... but then... A distressingly bad solo career. <br /> <br />Now back in The Division Bell. The songs build emotional momentum, and though the lyrics are not exactly shiny and happy, I always become filled with what I can only describe as optimism, and that's always a good feeling when confronted with those moments that make up a dull day. <br /> <br />Like Dark Side Of The Moon, this quintessential piece of work was written over time, improved, enhanced, embelished, played several times live before being released. Thus, they had all the time they needed to work on it, and they did it good. The album works as one. And there's all that feel on it that enhance even more the effect of the album. It's beautiful and complex. The darkness, as terrible and consuming as it was, need not be permanent.  <br /> <br />This album is absolutely necessary. The first proper Pink Floyd album since 1979 at least.  <br />

B0001NBMBC|3.0|O.k. now I'm a big time Knotter just on the basis of when they came out in 1999 they broke a lot of ground and changed the mold with the their debut self title CD \\"Slipknot\\" and then 2 years later in 2001 they released \\"Iowa\\" and to the delight of the \\"maggots\\" around the world, they delivered a full metal mouth shot that also got them a surprise Grammy nomination. Recently in late 2004, they released their 3rd major release \\"Volume 3 the Subliminal Verses\\". Just as I said before, I'm a big supporter of this band but I'm truly on the fence about this album. <br /> <br />Although it's not nearly as heavy as the previous 2 ventures, artistically it shows a more mature side. This album is extremely experimental (in my opinion) because they go with sounds and tunes that are distant in comparison yet still somewhat enjoyable. Again, I can understand why some other Knotters would be turned off by this album is because of the lack of really heavy stuff and I can agree to that because that's what puts me in between about this album but the music that isn't heavy when you take it at face value it's not that bad but yes to an extent it's not the Slipknot we're accustomed to. <br /> <br />First off, for those of you looking for a \\"Heretic Anthem\\", \\"Surfacing\\" or \\"Spit It Out\\" you might not find that on this. I would attest to say that a good portion of the songs on this album are slower and a little more on the side of say Iowa's title track \\"Iowa\\". Very eerie and a bit of a return of sampler Craig Jones inserting strange and spooky effects. One good thing is that the ever mixture of guitars, bass, sampling, drums and percussion gives us the patent Slipknot \\"wall of sound\\" where you hear just layers upon layers of fluid instrumental performance.  <br /> <br />One thing that I hear people complain about is that they felt as if singer Corey Taylor didn't put his all into the lyrics this time and for a pretty lame reason (very little swearing). I have to disagree a bit there because it shows a little more maturity than his usual rants and curse laden raves. Yes swearing can show a lot of emotion and passion about something but in the same light, doesn't just saying what you think mean the same thing? Just an observation I thought I'd point out. <br /> <br />Again, just because it's a new and different sound doesn't make it bad. Yes I was a little disappointed that I didn't get a heavier album from \\"Iowa\\" but \\"Volume 3\\" is what it is. I think it's a growth in maturity but I will go on record as saying I hope it's not a permanent direction of the band. I really don't want to do this but I feel as if I have to be fair at any cost so I regrettably give \\"Volume 3, the Subliminal Verses\\" a 3.2 stars. If you're looking to get into Slipknot, I'd check out the self title \\"Slipknot\\" (the enhanced extended version preferably) and then \\"Iowa\\". These are the better building blocks for the band. Also, if you're looking to check them out on DVD check out \\"Welcome To Our Neighborhood\\".
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Wown for Jarhead is slightly deceptive. From the get go, Mendes sort of baits the audience into thinking that they know exactly where this movie is headed. As the film opens, we are even treated to a sequence in which an abrasive, gung ho drill sergeant practically beats (literally) the rules of war into Swoff's head, in what could be best described as an ode to Full Metal Jacket's bigger than life R. Lee Ermey. The war film references don't stop there. There's also nods to the likes of Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter (a film I will never be able to watch in the same way again after seeing the way it's used in Jarhead) and the movie does have a tone that recalls David O. Russell's Three Kings, but Mendes ultimately takes Jarhead in a much different direction. The irony is, that while the journey itself is different, the outcome is virtually the same. <br /> <br />Given that Jarhead revolves around the war theme, and more to the point, those who fight in a war, it may come as a surprise that the movie isn't necessarily anti-war or pro-war. It's somewhere in between. Jarhead isn't so much a political statement as it is a unique glimpse into a side of war that I've certainly never seen depicted in a film. <br /> <br />Anchoring the movie is Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) who continues to mature as an actor with each passing performance. His Swoff is a compelling young man with layers upon layers of complexity, and Gyllenhaal is dramatic, vulnerable and extremely lively in the role. The rest of the cast is stellar. Peter Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Flight Plan) is extremely effective as Troy, the voice of reason in the field. Every time things begin to get out of hand, Troy is there to rectify the situation. Jaime Foxx lends his usual likable demeanor chewing up the scenery as an energetic sniper platoon leader. The rest of the actors who make up the sniper platoon are perfectly cast (they include Sling Blade's Lucas Black), and all are given a chance to shine individually, but it is the way they play off one another that really make the film tick. This cast has genuine chemistry. They truly come across as a brotherhood. <br /> <br />As Mendes films go, Jarhead didn't leave the same impression on me that American Beauty and Road to Perdition did., but it's still an exceptional film and takes this particular genre in to uncharted territory. It's well acted, well written, and well shot, and even though it's completely different than I thought it would be, I admire and respect it for it's patience and it's unique vision. While Jarhead may be about the \\"suck,\\" I'm happy to report that it doesn't suck at all. It is yet another masterful title on Mendes' small but impressive resume. <br />
B00014K5TQ|1.0|I think Seth & Mac are great actors, so they must have received horrible direction in this [more than painful to watch] movie.  Even though the people portrayed in this film were dramatic, over-the-top club kids, the acting was so over done, it was laughable.  I couldn't even watch the whole movie.<br /><br />If you want to see an interesting documentary (minus the murder) about a iconic club kid (but so much more), see The Legend of Leigh Bowery.
B000FILW86|5.0|In 1977 a mid-western RockNRoll band from ROCKFORD, ILL. called Cheap Trick made a name for themselves by re-invigorating ROCK music. They made RockNRoll fun again!!

B000DWMN2S|5.0|Everything is Illuminated has it all. Jonathan Safran Foer's characters have incredible depth to discover as we delve into three very different lives sort of thrown together on a journey to discover the past.  <br />This move has some hillarious moments, but takes a more serious turn that explores our relationships and links with one another.  <br />A new favorite movie, I picked up the book as well, and will be reading it shortly. I also picked up another of Foer's novels, which I loved.
B00005JNRY|4.0|Cars is yet another jaw-dropping animated work from Disney's Pixar Animation Studios.  The animation is breathtaking, beautiful.<br /><br />As usual, the characters are all cute, loveable.  You can read the story line in other reviews.  Suffice it to say, the story arc is typical Disney.<br /><br />What's best about Cars is that it teaches children that selfishness, vanity, and winning at all costs are not admirable traits or behaviors.  Putting others first, seeing the potential and beauty in things that, on the surface, are not beautiful, are  values glorified by this movie.  For that reason alone, kids (and their parents) should see this film.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I like Will Smith, and I read Asimov's original \\"I, Robot\\" long ago, as a teenager. So I had high hopes for this movie, but they were not fulfilled. The production is pretty good, and the film's basic message is OK -- but the high-speed action sequences aren't even remotely believable, as Will Smith fends off computer-generated robot armies time and again.  Not really a bad movie, but it could have been so much better!
B00008DDSC|4.0|Secretary explores the attraction of a dominant/submissive relationship, and other less \\"normal\\" preoccupations. <br /> <br />James Spader seems made to play these parts since \\"Sex Lies and Videotape\\" and the return with \\"Crash\\".  In \\"Secretary\\" he plays a lawyer with obsessive compulsive tendancies who has undergone a series of unconsumated forays into S & M or D & S  relationships with his secretaries, but ultimately has bowed out because he is unable to take them further. <br /> <br />Maggie Gyllenhall is excellent as the self-harming, low esteem child of an alcoholic father who is seeking to live a \\"normal\\" life.  She wants what her sister has, the husband, the family, the home in the suburbs.  Instead she has an obsession with cutting herself, an activity which delivers a momentary high once the pain has been delivered. <br /> <br />When the self-harming secretary and the OCD lawer meet it is a match made in heaven, almost.  Dr Grey tries to bow out as he has done in the past.  But this time he has met his match, a girl who is prepared to up the stakes to continue the relationship.  How far can they take it?  You must watch to find out. <br /> <br />The film contains only adult content, and extensive sexual scenes.  Yet it is not pornographic and manages to avoid descending out of the artworld and into seediness.  It is well done, with a strong cast and a humorous undertone throughout.

B00005JOIH|5.0|This is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, but also one of the hardest to watch.  It's extremely tough and challenging, confronting deep issues, and asking questions that inevitably must be answered.  In light of the massacre at the Olympic games in Munich, who's to say how a nation should react?  This movie is haunting, with excellent music, acting and cinematography.  The violence is pretty graphic; this movie is not for everyone.  But for those who will watch it, it's unforgettable.

B0000TG9E2|4.0|The story of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.<br /><br />Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.<br /><br />Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled \\"drink me\\" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.<br /><br />Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.<br /><br />Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.<br /><br />I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.<br /><br />For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches \\"Fantasia\\" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.<br /><br />This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears used to be known for her music. Sure, her looks played a huge part in making her so marketable, but songs here like the stunning \\"Toxic,\\" garnering the pop star her first Grammy, \\"Showdown\\" and \\"Everytime\\" only solidify that back in the day Spears did bring a lot to the table. In the Zone, her fourth studio album, may not be as consistent as her previous three (though sales have continued to be steady), but it shows artistic growth with now-pregnant Britney taking the helm of her career for once and doing what she wants. Her voice, of course, has never been an instrument to write home about, and here it's mostly processed to the point of unrecognizability (save for the two ballads here), but its unique quality at least sits heads above most of her unoriginal similar sounding pop star peers. Hopefully, in the near future before she totally washes out into the sea of musical obscurity, the infamous Britney Spears can close her legs for awhile, put her highly-publicized personal life to the side and focus more on her career again, because it's records like this one that show the girl could rock.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I saw a picture of David Gilmore recently. \\"My GOD! Has THAT much time really passed already?\\", I thought. Then, I looked in the mirror & confirmed the awful truth! It has!!<br /><br />So, okay, a bunch of years have gone by since the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" glory days...<br /><br />Does this guitar hero still have what it takes?<br /><br />Hell yeah!<br /><br />He's (wisely) called in a few friends (David Crosby, Graham Nash, Robert Wyatt, Phil Manzanera -on piano!), to round out the nucleus of his back up band. This gives him a sort of Pink Floyd feel, but maintains some distance & a better sense of his individuality.<br /><br />Pink Floyd's dreamlike music has always caused my \\"eyes to roll back in my head\\"<br /><br />and take me to mildly hallucinatory \\"places\\". This album does that as well.<br /><br />His stately, (and perfect!) guitar licks compliment the compositions beautifully; never embellishing where it isn't needed.<br /><br />It's often said that it's comparatively easy to be flashy & dramatic; but oh so difficult to play a perfect, simple melody.<br /><br />There are a great many perfect simple melodies on this album.<br /><br />This is a must for any true \\"Floyd\\" fan!<br /><br />-Dennis the mad vinyl junky

B00005JP0A|4.0|Fresh from A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION the incomparable Ms. Streep hits the street this time in designer shoes. And the rest is, as they say. . . As always Meryl Streep shows that she can play any role perfectly. Cast here as the dragon lady of a fashion magazine \\"Runway,\\" she is of course a joy to watch. Anne Hathaway, fresh from BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, is the recent college graduate who lands a job as an assistant to Ms. Streep while waitng for her ship as a fledgling writer to dock. No slouch herself, she gives Ms. Streep a good run for her money, helping Streep find her own heart, however small. The plot is predictable with only a couple of surprises. After all, this is a comedy; and good always triumphs over evil.<br /><br />These two women have a fine supporting staff; and the photography is spectactular, especially the footage of New York and Paris. I haven't seen so much about high fashion in a movie since Richard Gere wore all those Armani clothes in AMERICAN GIGOLO.<br /><br />So treat yourself to an entertaining movie in these, the Dog Days of summer.
B000002LCB|4.0|I'm sure everyone has fond memories of this film. The soundtrack always manages to make me smile.
B000002ADT|5.0|As the sheer number of reviews on this page - and the frequency with which that number grows - should attest, Miles Davis' most famed recording and the album frequently referred to as the greatest jazz session ever continues to hold unlimited appeal for neophytes, experts and everyone in between. Stellar, spare compositions eternally realized by a justly all-star band under the guiding vision of the genre's most important postwar figure; you simply can't go wrong. This is the album which first got me and many other rock fans I know into jazz, and its value as both a bridge between musical styles and an absolutely essential possession in its own right is beyond question. Fundamental!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|i would have to say that this is the best movie i've seen in a while. jane austen's classic novel was beautifully adapted into a great movie. i loved kiera knightley as elizabeth. and overall, i would reccomend this movie to everyone!
B00005JNQS|4.0|This is a great movie with all the elements for good family fun.  There is humor for the adults and children alike.  Compared to a lot of other animated films that are appealing to adults (i.e. Shrek, Shark Tale), this is still a children's film and doesn't contain a lot of humor that's over the heads of its audience.  All three generations of our family have enjoyed this film together.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|this new album is being very much over rated....i feel this album only has a couple of good songs...would not reccommend...
B000E8QVWY|4.0|When I was little my father would play Johnny Cash records and I distinctly remember \\"I Walk The Line\\".  While watching Joaquin Phoenix perform the song, you'd swear that it was Johnny Cash, himself.<br /><br />Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person.  Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash, the man. Not the legend and not what everyone thought he would be. What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an \\"everyman\\" and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being.  Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.<br /><br />The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing. But the love story between these two, the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart. I would recommend this film to anyone, Johnny Cash fan or not. If you don't like him now, you will when the movie is over
B00005JOQS|5.0|Superman Returns was better than the first two. It had the good elements of the first movies but with way better special effects and an even better plot. Superman Returns was NOT a remake of the first movie and does not re-do any scenes from the first movie as it would seem from the trailer. All it does is show how superman first learned how to fly, which the first movies didn't even show. And the ending was awesome. It was a Superman fan's dream. Definately better than other superhero movies. If you are a fan of Superman this is a must, and if your not, you'll understand the story quickly and enjoy it anyway. The trailer dosen't do it justice.   <br />
B00005JOQS|4.0|So I wasn't a very big Superman fan to begin with. I'd never seen any of the other movies, never read any of the comics, but I was able to easily pick up on the plot line throughout this movie. I did like the scenery very much. They made the places seem real. The water/crystal reactions were really well done, not some flimsy cardboard crap. There were a few places where it was obvious that Superman was CGed in, but it was tastefully done, so it didn't look cheesey. Overall, this was a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />....The curl on his hair annoyed me though.... <br /> <br />^_^
B00005JOX6|4.0|All I can say is that it was a good movie really! I think it was created for those workaholic people who often choose work over family...and in the end they still end up unhappy. This movie was a bit drama too and it did touch my heart which I never expected to feel such in an Adam Sandler film. It was really more of how you manage your time between your family and work. For me, it's a must-see movie.
0679601686|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (originally titled \\"First Impressions\\") is a witty, smart, sharp, and insightful comedy/romance of the 18th century. The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.<br /><br />  Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This album is wonderful the tracks are smooth and easy to listen to. Its truly the soundtrack of summer. Corinne Bailey is next rising star.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first saw Serenity at the movies and loved it.  What a ride.  And I have always liked Joss Whedon's other series and friends have continually said...you should see the Firefly series.  I know you will like it.  So after seeing Serenity....I decided....I want to know what came before.  And what a great albeit short series it is.  Lots of fun, adventure and drama all at the same time.  Whether or not you are a Joss Whedon fan....this is a great series to check out.
0143034901|3.0|This novel left with feelings both contradictory and intense, but there is no doubt to what they are. On the one hand, I felt completely underwhelmed by many aspects of this novel, and, unfortunately, those aspects that disappointed me the most were the very things that had initially attracted me to the book. While the NY Times might say that it's a combination of Eco, Borges and Marquez, this is, at best, only a half-truth. If you dive into this work expecting something of the magnitude these comparisons imply, then expect to be frustrated: the story itself has none of the depth that the works of these other authors are so widely praised for and Zafon himself does not have anywhere near the facility with and/or control of language that is synonymous with those three names. There are, to be certain, echoes of these other, more respected writers in this book, but it seems more like Zafon merely took immediately identifiable tropes from the works of these others (e.g. The Library of Forgotten Books which seems taken straight from a minor Borges story or the various \\"magical realist\\" qualities that could easily have come from Marquez's pen) and then applied them to a hopelessly and hokily conventional novel. And, what's worse is that it's a hopelessly conventional novel written in hopelessly mediocre prose (but, as is always the case with translated books, I don't know how much, if it at all, the translator is to blame).<br /><br />However, on the other hand, it should be noted that I did not hate this book, and in fact I read all 480 pages of it during one 24-hour period. The story is engrossing and the characters (for the most part) are fleshed out exceedingly well. It is easy to see why this is such a huge seller and I don't think that anyone would regret reading this work. This novel managed to grab my attention and hold it hostage until I was able to finish it. But, sadly, this fact still does not allow it to overcome its manifold flaws.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Spanning just 12 episodes (by design), Fawlty Towers is one of the great gems of British comedy, with the tall and lanky John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, owner of a small hotel which would run smoothly if not for his habit of getting into the most hilarious situations due to his boorish and obnoxious behaviour.<br /><br />The supporting characters, like Manuel (Andrew Sachs) who barely speaks English, Basil's wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and Polly  the maid (Connie Booth, who shares screenwriting credit with Cleese) are all perfect as their respective characters, serving more as a counterpoint to Cleese's madness. Highly recommended.
0767847431|5.0|This Sindbad film is a little slower to get going than many of the others.  But the writing is very fun, and the dialogue, acting, and story are all engaging.  Harryhausen's creatures are great, as always, and there's plenty of adventure.  John Phillip Law as Sinbad is very good too.  And Caroline Munroe is just beautiful. <br /> <br />I really liked this one almost as much as Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.  Maybe about half a star beneath Seventh Voyage, but a great and fun film that has aged very well.
1573225517|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to the funny, true world of Nick Hornby's fiction. If you only know the story through the film, you will be pleased to find a more fully developed lineup of characters as well as the room to let your imagination flesh out their quirks. Hornby lays bare many of the single man's worst flaws, and gets to the truth of dating in a way that few other novelists can hope to do. This is a romance that feels like it could really have happened.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I love this movie!  It is witty, classy and very funny!  Harrison Ford is brilliant and Julia Ormond is so elegant! <br />This is a very good romantic comedy.  It's a good family movie too . . . My whole family loves to watch it!  It's quite clean too, so I wouldn't worry about letting any little kids watch it with me. Overall just incredibly well done! Even better than the original! (and that's saying something!)
B00025ETIW|5.0|for Lifeson Hendrix \\"bobby\\" who said: Please folks, listen to some good music for your own good. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Dream Theater, Death, DragonForce, Tool, Children of Bodom, Jimi Hendrix, Rush, ANYTHING FOR GODSAKE, but not this... <br /> <br />I just like to say that I listen to my chemical romance and I listen to the bands u named. It was really shallow of you to come on here and say that. No one is gonna stop liking them just because you don't like them. Maybe MCR isnt your type but other people like them. they might think the same for your bands! get over it!  <br /> <br />This cd rocks! buy it if you haven't yet. I promise you won't be disappointed! If you want my opinion the best song is Thank You For The Venom!  <br />

0312954468|3.0|I love books on Egypt and enjoyed the book enough to over-look the inaccuracies and enough to overlook how the plot blends from life of father to son without significant transition. However it was very irksome how the slave/narrator character was so much larger than life. It got so out of control as to be unbelievable. Not to mention that the book was unnecessarily long. It started off well enough but finished poorly, leaving me empty. It's worth a read, but I'd check my library first. If you want a good egyptian read Id recommend instead \\"The eye of horus\\" by carol thurston. A similar story line but more cleanly written, with a glorious begining, middle and end.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I saw this on some movie channel awhile back and fell in love. Every aspect of this movie is incredible, from characters, design, story, to the voice-overs, it was wonderful. It's definitely not your average giant robo/magic girl/samurai/demon/action/what have you-style anime. Instead it's a touching (almost believable, as far as anime goes) and engrossing film about a trio of hobos in search of an abandoned baby's parents on Christmas Eve. But there is so much more than that. Simply put, this is one of the few anime's to really touch my heart. Unless all you are into is Inuyasha style mediocrity, you must see this. A movie has never made me cry, yet this one came real close. I can't say exactly why, but I love this movie more than almost anything else I've ever seen. (even more than Spirited Away)
B000F0UUIM|5.0|The Seachers is a story about a racist, ex-Confederate soldier seeking his neice, a girl captured by Comanches.  The problem is that the longer it takes the more likely she will end up becoming one of them.  John Wayne's character of Ethan Edwards struggles over the five year seach between his hate of the Indians and his love of his family.  This movie has few good guys and no real bad guys.  Everybody seems to have a dark and bloody history behind their character.  The humor, used with a light touch, keeps the film from getting too depressing.<br /><br />Like in the Shootist, another film I enjoy, John Wayne is not playing a John Wayne character.  His character, in fact, seems to fall apart as the search continues.<br /><br />This Disc set had commentary by Peter Bogdanovich who does a great job, along with two features on the movie and Behind The Cameras segments from Warner Brothers Presents TV series.  It seems John Ford decided to film what was happening behind the cameras at the same time he was making the film.  This makes for great extras from a film product made before the age of DVDS.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|A sign of of a really good movie is how well it tells a story. In this new, modern, fast paced and exciting film we are transported into the world of Kong and swept away its storytelling.  It is nothing short of a miracle that Peter Jackson has been able to bring this story to a contemporary audience and retell the story of Kong without said audience laughing.  It is both epic in scale and human in its pathos -- we care about Kong -- when was the last time you had true emotion for a CGI character is recent memory?  Great movie and Great storytelling.
1400079179|5.0|This book was a great read!<br /><br />It is fast paced, and full of action and intrigue.<br /><br />This book gets you thinking and the thinking continues past the ending!
B000F5GNX8|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, so I came to it with an open mind.  What I came away with was that this is an \\"Art Film\\" wannnabe.  The acting is Ok.  It is good to see Robert Downey Jr.  return to film and good to see Val Kilmer as well, but the film plods along baiting us into thinking that at any moment it is going to break into something other than an average film.
B00007LTIA|4.0|This 2 CD set allows you to hear the band not constrained by a 4 or 5 minute song.  All the songs are long, and they weave in and out of the various sounds that made Yes so distinct. <br /> <br />The Rhino recording is just OK, a bit too flat sounding to me, but it's been a few years since I've heard the original album.  It could be the original was not audiophile quality either. <br /> <br />A good set for real Yes fans - lots of memories here.
B00005Q4ED|3.0|The plot of the book has been simplified, the dialog is not particularly faithful to the book, and the overall tone is rather more melodramatic. However, there are few really glaring errors in terms of spoiling the period atmosphere, except for Rochester's statement that no one would care if he and Jane lived together without being married. In 1971 when the film was made, perhaps few people would have. In the Victorian era when the action takes place, every woman in their social circle would have refused to associate with any kept mistress or allow her to appear at respectable gatherings.   <br /> <br />The acting is good, and it's nice to see major characters who are not Hollywood stereotypically attractive.  The costumes are rather a mixed bag of mid-19th-century styles. The settings aren't bad. Thornfield Hall could be more luxurious, but Lowood School is done very well, complete with the constant noise of many girls chanting different lessons in the same room. The lighting is excellent, and the background music is sweeping enough to make you forgive a great deal.   <br /> <br />EXCEPT: <br /> <br />The DVD quality is atrocious.  The many and large streaks and blips on the screen, always worst right in the middle of it, are constantly spoiling the film.  I don't care if they had to use an old print, there is editing software to clean up this kind of thing. I spent about every other screen being distracted by a huge green line all the way down the middle--they could at minimum have cleaned up major problems like that. <br /> <br />So, when you buy this DVD you're getting your $4.99 worth.  No more.

I'm sick of this band, be sick of them too, Waiting for a Girl Like You. <br /> <br />PS. Waiting for a Girl Like You may like this band better than me. So go buy it for her........
B00000IOSU|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Sarah McLachlan is a gifted artist with a tremendous singing voice that's capable of touching the deepest depths of my soul.  Take the song \\"I Love You\\"   for example, this soft, slow, passionate song makes me close my eyes and dream about the love of my life every time I hear it.   <br /> <br />The cd is full of great songs and is a recording that will get played repeatedly by people in and out of love, allowing all of us to get lost in the words, music and passion that is Sarah McLachlan.  <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Mark-Allen Harris
B0002OERI0|2.0|I used to really like American Idiot, but now it's over. Boulevard of broken dreams needs to be over right now...so as the rest. Green Day are so overrated...Punk is overrated, go get Foreigner insted. <br /> <br />\\"For you, Waiting For A Girl Like You, have a nice day, you may not like this but that's ok.\\" <br /> <br />
B00008J4P5|5.0|I love this duo! Though this is the only White Stripes CD I own so far, I am a confirmed fan of Jack and Meg White. I am in my forties and have eclectic taste in music but tend to love rock best. I own and enjoy Audioslave, Alice in Chains, the Beatles, the Police, the Foo Fighters, Bonnie Raitt, No Doubt and even some French music among many other artists and genres. The White Stripes give me everything that I love about all of my favorite music: great lyrics, a compelling beat, hypnotic guitar and a truly unique voice. One of my favorite aspects of the music on the Elephant CD is the bluesy undertone to the music, expecially on Ball And Biscuit, which may be my favorite cut. Jack's voice is a physical, seductive sensation on this one. He seems to really unleash that voice and it is powerful! Black Math is another of my favorites because of the tempo changes. I have to stop whatever I'm doing during this song and let it carry me along. Jack's voice changes with the tempo also. Brilliant! Seven Nation Army is probably the most commercially successful song on the CD and it is still as fabulous as ever but there is so much more to love. All of the songs are very good. I highly recommend Elephant.
B000000W5N|1.0|Wow my friends, this is a total awful album. Mick Jagger is one of the crappiest singers of all time.and made some of their worst <br />songs ever in Brown Suger. Don't even say a word about Green Day either...say any word about Nirvana, Dire Straits, Foreigner, or <br />GNR insted as they were the GREATEST!!!!!! Stop messing around with this crappy band and their awful albums and go with all 4 of them bands insted. STONES WILL ALWAYS SUCK!!!!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I love these movies.  They are two of my favorite movies.  I remember seeing part 2 with my father a long time ago.  These are at such a low price and have so many good things in them that it's almost a crime not to buy.  Both are very well written.  They are funny and you will stay interested the whole movie.  So what are you waiting for? Buy BUY BUY BUY!
B000059LGC|5.0|Death on the Nile , an Agatha Christie mystery makes for a wonderful entertaining film. With stars which includes Peter Ustinov , David Niven , Bettte Davis , Mia Farrow , Angela Lanchbury etc. you cannot go wrong. Apart from the inevitable murder , Egypt and the Nile adds to the mystery . Angela Lanchbury`s wonderful portrayal of a sordid , romance writer who  totters around on the boat in a constant inebriated state and Bette Davis`s wry remarks definitely adds to the fun part. Highly recommended. <br />

B000F8DT4Q|4.0|When you look at this deluxe set it seems incredible the amount of material that you get--b-sides single mixes and 12\\" remixes.  Please note that most of the b-sides offered are instrumental early versions of songs that made it on the album.  Only the marauders and sea song seem up to par with the album itself.  The much touted a-side is from a few years earlier and fits more closely with the hurting album.  I liked the 12\\" remixes as primitive as they sound by todays standards, but I challenge anyone to listen to track 11 which consists of someone repeating \\"James Brown\\" close to 100 times, similar to the tom tom clubs genius of love in trying to add credibilty? to the recording.  Stars are for the album itself.
0385720920|5.0|Victor Mancini is a $exaholic who dropped out of medical school to care for his psychotic mother, now in an assisted living facility.  The story, told in first-person by Victor, begins with a warning not to read the rest of the book.<br /><br />Victor then accounts the tale of his life, liberally interspersed with flashbacks to the times his mother broke out of prison or asylums to steal him back.  Victor's best friend is a self-abuser who collects rocks to keep him in recovery.  They both work in a Colonial-Era theme park, playing roles of servants and nobodies who more often than not wind out in the stocks at the village center.<br /><br />Victor finances his mother's care by pretending to choke in restaurants.  Once \\"saved\\" by a fellow human, he has found that people will offer money to keep him on his feet.  He keeps an account of the names and dates from which different people \\"saved his life\\", and occupies his spare time sending thank-you notes to the hundreds of people he has scammed this way.<br /><br />A strange relationship develops between Victor and his mother's doctor, Paige Marshall.  Of course, Victor will discover that Dr. Marshall has extreme oddities of her own.<br /><br />'Choke' is filled to the brim with oddities.  One could almost describe it as having \\"too much information\\", but Victor is relentless in his descriptive narrative of comparisons and discoveries.  From $exaholics to the insanities of the \\"nursing homes\\", old-people's diseases and hallucinations, behind-the-scenes accounts of the recovery meetings, and Victor's own recollections of his childhood, 'Choke' is one messed-up book.<br /><br />Dude, if you like the bizarre, the psychotic, the deranged, the loony, the batty, and love to cheer for the lunatic protagonist, then you will love Palahniuk.  'Choke' is an amazing stream of meanderingly meaningless and subtly delirious mind-farts from the twisted brain of one Victor Mancini.  And if you think he's bad, wait till you meet his mother.<br /><br />Enjoy!t his mother.   <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br />
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Outstanding!  Adventure, romance, color, history, special effects, cannon, swordplay, nver a dull moment.  Not only does Depp paly the role to a tee, but the Barbosa is his perfect counter-foil.  Five stars for casting, continuity and color.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Amsterdam, one of the funnest places in the world.  Where better to begin our trip?  Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are two horny young men vacationing through Europe with new friend, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson).  Staying in a hostel in Amsterdam and accidentally locked out after curfew, they are invited in through the window of a neighboring house by an oddball named Alex (Lubomir Bukovy).<br /><br />Alex tells the young men of a hostel in Slovakia where the girls will do anything for Americans, so instead of traveling to Barcelona they leave for Bratislava.  When they arrive, they discover they are sharing living quarters with Natalya (Barbara Nedeljakova) and Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova) who show the boys a good time.  The next morning, Oli is missing.  Paxton and Josh wind out partying again with Natalya and Svetlana while searching for Oli, and they too are separated after becoming extremely drunk ... or drugged.<br /><br />It is here that this movie takes off, and dips us into the horrors of what the girls call an \\"Art Show\\" but turns out to be a horrifying nightmare for those whose admittance is free.  It is here in this exclusive \\"resort\\" that the very wealthy pay enormous sums of money to commit torture and murder on real humans.  (5K RUS, 10K EUR, 25K AMR -- I found it a bit ironic that killing an American cost the most, probably because most of the world hates Americans)<br /><br />I really loved the way the film corresponded the sleazier sites of Amsterdam (peep-rooms and streets of prostitutes) and utilized it for the titillating grotesqueries inside the warehouse.  Drill bits, hammers, scissors, metal claws, shackles, chainsaws, guns, and hooks.  Chains with hooks are cool.  It doesn't matter if its fishhooks ala Hellraiser or heavy-duty cargo hooks like Ghost Ship; chains and hooks are a meaty favorite of the true horror fan.<br /><br />Our antiseptic society also craves some nice filth to go with our gore.  There is plenty sludge and muck in 'Hostel'; dirty walls and backed up drains and grimy, stinky goo.  There are rubber gloves, rubber aprons, rubber boots, filthy tools, and cart full of bloody bodies.<br /><br />Some additional niceties worth mentioning are the street urchins, a bit of automotive revenge, a toilet swirly, the chainsaw finger removal (finger chopping with a chainsaw is much tastier than with a knife) and a very satisfactory ending for the revenge bug in all of us.<br /><br />I also got a kick out of the janitorial service.  How would you like to clean up that place ... daily?  Of course, methinks the janitors were slackers, it was still messy when they were finished.<br /><br />For those who like their horror slippery with blood and touched with insanity, 'Hostel' is a must have.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!ge and muck in 'Hostel'; dirty walls and backed up drains and grimy, stinky goo.

B0002XVQNU|5.0|My favorite comic heroes included The Thing, The Fantastic Four, Conan, The Flash, Wolverine, The X-Men, Captain America (and the Falcon), Tarzan, Spider-Man and Daredevil. What intrigued me about Daredevil was that, although he was very similar to Batman (and, to a lesser extent, Spider-Man), he was BLIND.<br /><br />Daredevil really started to get hot when Frank Miller and, later, Ann Nocenti wrote for the comic in the 80s (Nocenti's run started out unimpressive but slowly became outstanding).<br /><br />With this understanding I was naturally excited to see the film rendition of \\"Daredevil\\" that debuted in February 2003. After seeing the movie I thought it wasn't bad. They got a lot right -- like Daredevil's costume, the mood and the casting (this was my first exposure to Ben Affleck so I had no beef with him playing Matt Murdock/Daredevil). Still, there was something wrong with the picture; it was too light and brisk. Yes, it certainly had pizazz, but it was mostly superhero fluff with little depth -- a perfect example of style over substance. Plus the cutesy playground scene where Matt first meets Elektra was out of place.<br /><br />The Director's Cut reveals what went wrong: Some studio dork made the idiotic decision to cut out the meat of the story, which naturally dumbed down the film. In plain language: THE FILM WAS GUTTED.<br /><br />All I can say is: Thank God for director's cut DVDs! Two years after its theatrical release I picked up the Director's Cut of \\"Daredevil\\" and was blown away. The director, Mark Steven Johnson, took out some unnecessary fluff, like the premature Matt/Elektra sex scene, and added over 30 minutes of material that was integral to the story and SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CUT in the first place. This new material centers around the character-defining subplot of Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson working on a case that ties into the whole Kingpin storyline. Many say the fight scenes are also superior in the Director's Cut, which is hard to tell unless you view both versions back-to-back.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: Everything about this film magically works. Colin Farrell is entertaining as the crazed Bullseye, Jon Favreau is splendid as Foggy, and Michael Clarke Duncan is outstanding as The Kingpin; yeah, I know they deviated with the skin color, but who gives a hoot anyway? The soundtrack, which includes selections from various heavy bands, is stupendous. The touching scenes are truly touching, like when Matt & Elektra share intimate moments on the roof and Elektra's solo workout, and the kick-axx parts are really kick-axx. Two great songs by Evanescence are featured: \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" There are a lot of great lines in the film as well, in particular from The Kingpin and Bullseye (\\"Tell me, how do you kill a man without fear?\\" \\"By putting the fear IN him\\").<br /><br />Daredevil's origin story is also perfect -- emotionally charged but not over-long or needlessly complicated like \\"Hulk\\" (2003).<br /><br />One of the greatest successes of this film is simply the mood. It's dark and reverent at the same time. Daredevil is perfectly portrayed as the tortured loner; Affleck does a fantastic job.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The aforementioned cutesy playground scene was obviously included for fun and to liven things up at that point, but it doesn't belong; it destroys the believability of the picture and characters. It should have been omitted from the Director's Cut. Still, it's not that bad. I can tolerate it, and admit that it is a fun scene, if nothing else.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is good but she doesn't really fit the character of Elektra from the comics. She has a quality to her disposition that's simply too innocent, pure and likable. Not that these are bad traits, of course; they just don't fit the character of Elektra, an assassin. Kelly Hu, who played Lady Deathstrike in X2, would've been the perfect choice. Still, I personally don't mind Ms. Garner in the role; it's an acceptable deviation (one must allow some latitude in comic-to-screen adaptations).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"Daredevil: The Director's Cut\\" ranks up there with the best superhero films of all-time. In fact, it's my personal favorite. If you haven't yet seen the Director's Cut get a copy and see for yourself. I encouraged a friend who's in the comics business to view the Director's Cut. His appraisal of the theatrical cut was (understandably) a mediocre 6/10 Stars, but after seeing the Director's Cut he raised his rating to 9.5/10 Stars! Like me, he was stupefied that the decision was actually made to gut-out such important story elements in the theatrical release.<br /><br />Ahh, but all is well with the Director's Cut.

B000EULJLU|2.0|First of all this review is not meant for the die-hard nonthinking Tool fan because I know that you picked up this album the day it dropped.  I already know how Maynard changed your life and expanded your simple horizons, as I've heard this argument from every other \\"unique\\" Tool fan. Spare me your time.  As for the album, the songs are one-dimensional, static, repetitive, and the lyrics are surprisingly sophomoric.  Nothing on the album even seems to stand out.  The only thing that keeps this album from getting generic radio airplay is the fact that most songs are too long for public broadcast.  This album is everything that Tool musically stood out against.   <br />     The worst part of all is that much like Lateralus, the only worthwhile part of this album is the packaging.  Unfortunately,  a pretty package,unlike a musical masterpiece, can only entertain you for about ten minutes.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Wolfmother sounds like they were frozen in time somewhere around 1974 and thawed out in 2006 and then listened to Queens of The Stone Age and the White Sripes for some modern influence.  This is just guitar rock at it's most basic and purest...just what we need right now with some of the subpar new hard rock/metal bands that are popping up that all sound the same.  At times the lyrics are a little cartoonish but who cares?!  It's about the music and it RAWKS!!!!! My favs on here are \\"Dimension\\"(sounds just like Black Sabbath during the bridge section), \\"Collosal\\", \\"Joker & The Thief\\" and \\"Witchcraft\\".
B00005JMX6|4.0|Teen comedies always turn up big business at the box office, this is generally due to the fact that the creative forces behind these movies include plenty of crude humor, sex, and nudity as can be allowed under the MPAA ratings system.  Most of the time these teen comedies are a dime-a-dozen, opening big and fading shortly thereafter, with little lasting appeal with audiences.  However, there have been some successes in the genre that have had more staying power than others, examples would be \\"Animal House\\", the `Scary Movie' franchise, and the `American Pie' series.  With those examples of successful teen comedies, they all have some common traits in which they share, basically they are packed full of sex, nudity, and crude humor and language.  However, one thing these examples of successful teen comedies, and even the unsuccessful ones lack is any amount of heart or soul in the story.  In 2004, Fox Studios produced yet another teen comedy to appease the masses for a short while, \\"The Girl Next Door\\".  Starring Elisha Cuthbert (TV's \\"24\\") and an unknown lead actor named Emile Hirsch, \\"The Girl Next Door\\" would stand out from the other teen comedies that have come before it or even after it, for this movie contained the one thing that I said was lacking in those others, that is heart and soul. <br /> <br />\\"The Girl Next Door\\" is the story of 18-year-old Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), a straight-laced, overachieving, good boy who has never really lived life to the fullest.  That is, until he spies his incredibly sexy neighbor (Elisha Cuthbert) changing in the window, and finds that through his desire to be with her, he will do anything and everything to be with her.  But, Matthew gets thrown for somewhat of a loop when he discovers that his perfect `girl next door' is actually a former porn star, who is trying to forget about the life she used to lead.  Now, Matthew's sheltered life quickly begins to spin out of control as he attempts to help his new girlfriend leave the life she knew to embrace the life she longs for. <br /> <br />The reason I feel this movie is far and above those other teen comedies I listed, some of which I enjoyed by the way, is like I said earlier \\"The Girl Next Door\\" contains plenty of heart and soul in its story.  This movie isn't simply about having sex, yes there is that obligatory teen comedy element in this movie, but this movie is actually about the discovery that sex isn't the only thing to look for in a relationship with someone.  To prove that point the main character in the story, Matthew, who by the way is played perfectly by Emile Hirsch, is forced to learn that to have a true meaningful relationship with a woman, he must get past his lustful desire to only want the physical body, with no regard for the emotional side of the woman.  A lesson he has to learn the hard way, and it forces his character to mature throughout the story, until finally he is able to have a committed relationship with this `girl next door', as he discovers that she is more than just a beautiful woman, and former porn star, and in fact that she is a person with real feelings.  And all she asks of Matthew is that he move past her former life and see her for who she truly is. <br /> <br />The writing in this story is better than most contained in this type of movie, generally the story is fairly thin, and is pretty much there to link each crude joke to the next or to bridge the gap between sex scenes; however, in this movie the story is the main focus, yes there are the crude jokes and a couple of sex scenes, but the story isn't simply a minor plot device to get the audience to these obligatory teen comedy sequences.  The actors all do a very good job of bringing their characters to life, and appear to be enjoying themselves immensely with the roles they've been given.  Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch share a great chemistry that helps to elevate this movie to almost a romantic comedy level, instead of just teen comedy.Timothy Olyphant (\\"A Man Apart\\" and \\"Scream 2\\") makes several appearances throughout the film as a shady porn producer, and he manages to steal almost every scene that he's in, and actually provides Matthew with some rather sage advice, though inadvertently I might add. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of teen comedies, but are perhaps tired of the same old thing, then check out \\"The Girl Next Door\\", I promise you it is more than your average teen, gross-out sex comedy. <br /> <br />\\"The Girl Next Door\\" is available in both rated R and Unrated editions, both contain language and sexuality/nudity.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I went to the Eagles Farewell I tour in Denver Colorado, and so was excited to see this DVD slated for release.  I was a bit worried, however, that the concert experience would not be adequately portrayed on the DVD,  I'm glad to say I was wrong. Aside from the incredibly good music the band is very entertaining, from Joe Walsh's antics to Glenn Frey's joking familiarity with the audience to the overall \\"good times\\" vibe the band puts out when it plays, and this element of entertainment was very much a part of the DVD concert.   <br /> <br />The cinematography on this film is spectacular, the audio is great, and the camera work excellent.  In short, this DVD set is of the highest quality, and showcases the band's remarkable talent perfectly.  Add to this the great performances of the hits and the band's easy going ability to poke fun at itself and at various other things (the tour is called Farewell I, after all) and you've got a very entertaining couple hours of live music.
1400079179|4.0|Three-and-a-half stars.<br /><br />Dan Brown may not be the greatest literary force of the modern world, but he can sure generate controversy (and book sales) with his writing.  He takes the literal Holy Grail of all Holy Grails and thrusts it into a web of deceit and treason by way of the historically-questioned Priory of Scion and the Catholic Church.<br /><br />The basics of the story are that four essential members of the Priory have been murdered, an American professor, Robert Langdon, has been framed for their murder, and pretty much all of France is after him.  He is aided by a French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu.  He's being chased by a number of people (including a misguided, albino monk) and seeks out the help of others in hopes to prove his innocence.  As the story barrels along at a very quick pace, it is determined that the answer to everyone's problems lies with the discovery of the Holy Grail.<br /><br />I won't go into the numerous inaccuracies of Brown's revised history.  I won't bother with the whole Christianity vs. Dan Brown aspect either.  Just realize that this book is FICTION.  If you base your soul's destiny on a work of fiction, God help you.  If you base your arguments of why Christianity (Catholicism in particular in this book) is false, controversial, etc. on this book, then you have no weight to your arguments.  This is fiction and nothing else.  I sometimes wonder that had the Christian community kept quiet about this book, then perhaps it wouldn't have garnered the attention that it has received.<br /><br />In short, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is nothing more than an above average adventure/mystery that ranks somewhere between the tech-heavy Clive Cussler books and the scientifically exciting Steve Alten \\"Meg\\" series.  Brown manipulates history and, in some cases, completely fabricates facts to move his story along.  In college, I was always told that when writing something, you should always write about what you know.  Brown seems to have done a little research on his \\"Code\\" subject, but he eventually gave in to fabrication in order to make his story the controversy that it has become.<br /><br />Would I read it again?  Probably not.  Would I suggest it to others?  Sure, if you enjoy fast-paced, easily digested thrillers.  Mildly recommended.<br /><br />P.S.  In case you're wondering, I am a Catholic who decided to read this book just to see what all the ruckus was about.

B0000VD04M|5.0|Tim Burton's \\"Ed Wood,\\" a surreal bio-pic is one of the most entertaining, inspiring, and funny bio-pics I've seen. No wonder really since it's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio-pic writers Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski (who, after this film, would pen the Larry Flynt bio-pic \\"The People Vs. Larry Flynt\\" and the Andy Kaufman bio-pic \\"Man on the Moon\\"). It's also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, 'Finding Neverland'), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, 'Ed Wood'), Sarah Jessica Parker ('Failure to Launch'), Patricia Arquette ('True Romance'), Jeffrey Jones ('Deadwood'), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray <br />(Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation'). Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr., an aspiring filmmaker who's down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Parker). After hearing about a film being made about a transsexual, without a script, Ed pens a script called \\"Glen or Glenda.\\" <br />The movie is kind of close to Ed's heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman's clothes. But he's not gay. While walking past a shop that sells coffins Ed meets the actor Bela Lugosi (Landau), who played Dracula in the classic Universal film and recruits him to star in the Glen or Glenda film. The movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made. Not letting it get him down, Ed goes to work on his next film \\"Bride of the Atom.\\" After a few more films and meeting a few new people, including wrestler Tor Johnson (George \\"The Animal\\" Steele), TV personality Vampira (Lisa Marie), and psychic Criswell (Jones); Ed goes on to make his masterpiece \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\\" The latter is the only film I've ever seen by Ed Wood. While the movie has been called the worst film ever made, it wasn't bad. It's campy and stupid; You can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Ed Wood was an interesting,and quirky, guy...Which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life. Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona. He looks and sounds like Lugosi. Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood's life, through his first film to his \\"masterpiece.\\" We hear the downside of his life through the epilogue. This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to \\"B\\" movies that is over-the-top yet perfect. As I said, the movie is very funny. Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi. Bill Murray co-stars as Ed's transsexual friend Bunny. <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
B00005JOQS|3.0|I guess I'm in a different boat from these other reviewers.  I went to see this movie simply because I wanted to see if today's technology/CGI/special effects could add a better/different dimension to the Superman films of the past.  I think the answer is easily yes.  Though some of the special effects are far from flawless, most of it is pretty darn good.<br /><br />The movie itself is an entirely different story.  What trips this movie up time after time is its reliance on the old Superman movies that starred Christopher Reeves.  I have to agree with the reviewer that said:<br /><br />\\"The young actor playing Superman? He's not bad at all, really. But he doesn't play Superman; he does an impression of Christopher Reeve doing Superman.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't put it any better myself.  There were plenty of moments in the movie that made me roll my eyes, but none were as bad as when Brandon Routh (Superman) stops a plane from crashing and then quoting a line from the original movie word for word about \\"flying being the safest way to travel.....statistcally speaking.\\"  Kate Bosworth mails in a pretty hollow rendition of Lois Lane and her \\"husband\\" (what part of the storyline is that?), played by X Men star James Marsden (Cyclops), is equally as cardboard as Bosworth is.<br /><br />There are great moments all throughout the movie that do manage to overshadow the points stated above.  Great special effects, a pretty good job by Kevin Spacey, and Superman having a son (thus leaving room for a sequel) are probably the most intruiging aspects of the movie.  The action is pretty good, but don't expect a two and a half hour thrill ride; it simply will not happen.  I think the most excited I got was when the trailer for Spider Man 3 came on.  Superman was done well, but it did leave a lot of room for improvement.  As far as religious conotaions, only if you were reading too far into the movie would you find those kinds of things.  The characters were way too lifeless for it to be deliberate.  As far as special effects go, I believe you will get your money's worth.<br /><br />Bottom line: Superman Returns had potential to be great.  Though it was done well, I can't help but feel like being good simply wasn't sufficient when greatness was within reach.ial effects go, I believe you will get your money's worth.    Bottom line: Superman Returns had potential to be great.  Though it was done well, I can't help but feel like being good simply wasn't sufficient when greatness was within reach.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is the story of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans (werewolves); a war that has been raging for over a thousand years. One of the great things about Underworld is that it takes  Vampire and Werewolf lore and fleshes it out, avoiding tired cliches, leaving us with a very fresh story.<br /><br />One could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story. There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches. For example, there is an attraction between a Vampire character and a Werewolf, but it never deteriorates into cheesiness. We are left wondering what happens after the movie ends as opposed to being tortured with loves scenes that would have been out of place in a flick such as this.<br /><br />Those who don't have much of a taste for action movies and monsters might hate Underworld, and those who think Anne Rice's universe is the only one that matters might hate it as well (because it breaks tired vampire cliches), but those looking for a fresh monster story will love it. If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.<br /><br />Understand that Underworld is not perfect, but it entertains. The story does drag at times when the action sequences seem to go on forever. The fight scenes start to blur into one big fight. But I was left wanting more. The worldbuilding was great. Anytime I walk away from a movie wanting to know more about the world, I give kudos to the writers. Underworld did this for me.<br /><br />A side note: some compare this to the Matrix? Other than a few minor fight scenes where the action flipping is similiar, this comparison is unfounded and unfair to both films. Underworld never comes off as trying to be Matrix-y. It is a modern action trend to have Matrix-like fighting scenes, but a good thing about Underworld is that they did not turn every fight scene into a fight scene from the Matrix. The use of modern fight cliches was limited.<br /><br />Underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it. Those who want cliches or the Matrix part 4 will hate it.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 65<br /><br />27 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

B000000JO3|5.0|I bought every single one of the albums on this cd back when they originally came out. I listened to them over and over and over and over. I preached the gospel of Minor Threat to everybody that would listen. Some thought I was crazy, others got on board.  <br /> <br />I am currently a professor at a small private college. Every time a student enters my classroom and defines themselves as 'punk' I ask them in they own any Minor Threat. If they say 'no,' I demand that they get a copy of this CD and report back to me. Some think I'm crazy, others get on board. <br /> <br />I suspect I'll still be listening to Minor Threat when I am old and grey.

B000957O7S|5.0|Will Smith does a great job! I think this is one of the better romantic comedies I have seen.
B000005JA8|5.0|There seems to be a misplaced note at the halfway mark of the album; I've listened to it over and over and am convinced that note shouldn't be there. <br /> <br />Other than that, all the rest of the album is great! I especially love the beautiful, melodic vocal harmonies and the sweet guitar passages.   <br /> <br />My only regret is that Beefheart & Band didn't do a Trout Mask \\"trilogy\\"; following up this album with 2 more just like it.  You know...like Star Wars, Die Hard or Free Willy trilogies.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|My husband and I heard David Gilmour on the Tonight Show, which prompted our purchase of this album.  We've enjoyed it immensely and bought two copies as gifts.  The CD booklet is original and beautifully made.  Highly recommended.
B00005JOYA|5.0|I dont care what anyone else has said about this movie.  I had never heard of the game or played it before seeing the film and I really enjoyed the movie.  Yes it was a tad confusing but I thought it was well played out and the acting was great.  Im a big movie buff and it takes alot to impress me and this movie did just that.!! The monsters were scary and not cheezy, I was kept on the edge of my seat, and not once did I lose interest in it.  Yes it is a tad bloody but deff. a scary movie.  I will buy the dvd once it comes too for I will watch this movie again and I recommend it to anyone who likes scary movies.  If you want a movie that doesnt make sense and is cheesy go see An American haunting.  that was bad.  This was great :)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is my 7-year-old daughter's favorite director, but the first time we watched this (about a year ago) she was creeped out by it and didn't want to finish.  I let it rest for about a year then tried it again.  This time I explained a bit to her ahead of time about the Shinto traditions and how the spirits in the movie should be viewed not as monsters but as the essence of the things they are believed to inhabit (rivers, radishes, etc.)  I watched it with her and tried to answer questions as they came up.  Now it's one of her favorites, and we've viewed it several times.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Great music! Great cinematography too. Loved the stories of the musicians. Watching the movie gives me the feeling of being in Cuba.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Okay, I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to movies. There is a lot of junk out there. More than ever before. Tired of the same ol' same ol. Tired of the excessive ratio of 5-to-1 horror movies shot by your neighbor on the video shelves. Tired of talentless people getting GOLDEN opportunities to star in films and less then average screenplays getting green lit.<br /><br />That being said... I'm not NEAR as jaded as some of these SUPERMAN geeks who are whining about the costume (ENOUGH ALREADY). They've read so many comic books so many times that they can't bare to see ANYTHING altered.<br /><br />That being said. SUPERMAN turns out being what going to the movies is all about. An adventure. Escapism. If you're going into this movie LOOKING for things to complain about, I feel sorry for you. ME, I found myself wrapped up in a film more than I've been in a long time. I felt the dread. I felt the emotional moments. I laughed and I cried (well... I didn't cry, but I welled up once... I'm a new Dad... give me a break).<br /><br />Superman has it all. Most importantly, Bryan Singer (the director), did what a lot of these superhero films are forgetting to do (i.e. see fantastic 4... er, don't), that is, get the audience EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.<br /><br />SUPERMAN's opening sequence sets the stage wonderfully. As his ship crash lands once again in the Kent family farm in Smallville, Kansas, you wonder briefly if we're looking back in time, rehashing, and then his earthbound mother finds him in the wreckage, cradles him and says, \\"Clark. My son.\\"<br /><br />Many things have changed. Most noteably, Lois Lane is now married with son. Lex Luther is free from prison and SUPERMAN wastes no time realizing that the world was missing him.<br /><br />I won't give away things, because SUPERMAN has surprises. But, I will say that KEVIN SPACEY brings Lex Luther to life. He is phenominal, kooky, funny, insane and dangerous. You feel the dread. You feel the danger in the plan he is concocting. I mean... how to do you defeat the unbeatable man of steel? Well, the creators of this new version of SUPERMAN hooked me.<br /><br />I think, Kevin Spacey, in a lot of ways... made the film.<br /><br />The film is gifted with comedy, nostalgia, action, romance, dread, surprises and heroism, and despite what some are criticizing, this IS, WITHOUT QUESTION, one of, if not THE BEST Superhero movie to come along in a long time. Many of the tactics and techniques used in this film will set the standard for future hero films.n he is concocting. I mean... how to do you defeat the unbeatable man of steel?

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this movie. It is actually perfect. The casting is great, the acting is great, the scenery is great, and the pacing of the movie is great. Nothing, nothing to compare it to. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it now. Its the BEST BBC/period film I have ever seen, and worth the 6 hours it takes to watch it. Jennifer Ehle is the best Lizzie ever, and Colin Firth was so convincing!
B00008L3U1|5.0|One of the best William's movies,it'll make you cry, laugh, and think about how lucky you are of being normal and healthy and how valuable are love and time in the life of some people.<br /><br />Excellent movie to be seen in family or alone (if you are ashamed of crying in front of other people)I loved this movie
B00000F169|3.0|A classic if underbudgeted satire from the mid-70's.  The humor and atmosphere is a cool reminder of the \\"What are we fighting for?\\" popular mentallity of the Vietnam Era
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Thank you, thank you, thank you for finally releasing the \\"real\\" versions of these films. Star Wars (a new hope) is the first movie I ever remember seeing and the \\"new, improved\\" versions are messing with my childhood memories. All I ever wanted was DVDs of the movies I remember and love. Maybe they weren't everything Lucas wanted them to be, and it's his right to revisit them, but they were an amazing achievement for the time and I am grateful he's finally allowing us to own a piece of cinematic history. I sympathize with the people who have bought all the different special editions over the years, and I wish he wasn't bundling the new versions with the old, but don't trash the movies' ratings because of that. Items should be rated on their own merits, and these movies are amazing.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is my fav Metallica CD. After being a diehard fan for many years, I would not have thought that I would ever like to hear Metallica's music goobered up in some grandiose Moody Blues way. But the fact is, I love this music, and I love hearing it in a new way.    \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is definetly the highlight, but there is much to find. It takes several listenings to just to take it all in. Then you can start making your decisions about what works and what doesn't. I pretty much like all of it.
1878424114|5.0|This book changed my life forever!  I found it at the airport bookstore, while en-route to making a life-changing move from LA to Maui, Hawaii!  It's been a fixture on my desk ever since, as a constant reminder that we possess pure potentiality to achieve anything in life we want.  Best part, its so easy to read, yet amazingly profound.
B0000028UK|5.0|This CD brought Pearl Jam to their peak. They have done much good music since this, but it stands together as a whole in a way that not all of their CDs do. Kind of like that Outgrabe \\"City of God\\" CD, this collection brings together varying musical appoaches and melds them into a unified, if surprising, whole. <br /> <br />I have liked this band a lot since I was a kid, and I still find them of interest. In my opinion, they have surpassed their \\"grunge\\" label and moved on to become very much their own unique thing.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|\\"Good company is always worth seeking.\\"<br /><br />\\"My idea of good company is the fellowship of clever, well informed people, who have a great deal of conversation and a liberality of ideas.  That is what I call good company.\\"<br /><br />\\"That is not good company.  That is . . .\\"  (If you want to know the rest of the line, then rent the movie).<br /><br />During her lifetime Jane Austen published her novels anonymously - a choice common for female authors of that time.  One of my favorite college professors had a sentence on a piece of paper on his office door.  It said, \\"I'd rather be reading Jane Austen.\\"  In the early 1800s, before psychology was a science, Jane Austen, an unmarried young woman, had the audacity to publish her thoughts on the workings of the inner mind.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie adaptation of Austen's final novel, a novel she wrote when her health was failing and she probably knew she had little time left to express what she had to say.  Reading the cast list for this movie is a \\"Who's who\\" of great actors:  Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Sophie Thompson, etc.  The acting is terrific.  There are certain movies that are so good that I don't wish to comment too much on the movie itself because it is not improved by my commentary.  Other movies in that category include Emma Thompson's Sense & Sensibility (to which Ms. Thompson added many of her own sensibilities to the screenplay).<br /><br />Austen's characters are often caught up in an internal dialogue, constantly re-evaluating the decisions of the past.  In Austen's era, these thoughts were made more desperate and consequential because romantic love could only be found in one other person.  Her characters are constantly jockeying to gain power, stature, & wealth through social, exclusivity contracts.  For Austen's characters, the one person is usually separated by distance, time, or rules of society.  Austen comments on how the mind seems to concentrate on the imprinted loves of the past (See Spielberg's \\"A.I.\\").  Her heroines tend to think there was a person in their past whose character so well matched their own, that to be reunited would bring some fulfilment.  And in her novels, often the two are combined in the end, defying the odds and rewarding their moral behavior and steadfastness.  The reader can see that the two are not just imprinted on each other;  rather, there are many good reasons why their chemistry works well.<br /><br />\\"Captain Wentworth . . . You have an extraodinary ability to discompose my friend sir.\\"<br /><br />This is true.  The book is titled \\"Persuasion\\".  It is not titled \\"Control\\".  The protagonists in the movie argue regularly with the intent to be persuasive, not to be controlling - and that is an essential distinction.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps you have not been in Bath long enough to learn to enjoy these parties they give.\\"<br /><br />\\"They mean nothing to me.  Those who hold them believe the theatre to be beneath their dignity, but I am no card player.\\"<br /><br />\\"No.  You never were, were you?\\"<br /><br />Jane Austen, as a young woman was a genius ahead of her time, and in some ways is still ahead of our time.  Great authors and artists find a way to speak to their generation in a way that both respects the status quo, yet somehow uses metaphor or narrative to look on the status quo's priorities from a new perspective.  For example, Willa Cather's \\"My Antonia\\" may be one of the first great works of lesbian literature (although most people would probably disagree with me).  That book certainly is not written from an ordinary male \\"voice\\", even if the narrator is male.  Similarly, Jane Austen questioned every social construct around her and tried to illustrate the conflicts that the social systems created against the natural, moral drives of the human psyche.  Her debate has fascinated us for hundreds of years.<br /><br />The movie is not about \\"old, boring people who lived hundreds of years ago.\\"  Likeall her novels, this movie is robust and a worthwhile social discourse today.<br /><br />Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related works.comment, express feedback, or suggest related works.
B0007GADZO|5.0|This is an awesome work of art by Vai. Sure it isnt as hard as say Bad Horsie but just look at the title of the album. Does that really seem like something with hard rock on it. Many people complain about Vai's Singing and i got to say its pretty good from how much everyone complains about it. When he plays little wing live he does the vocals and its awesome. The only song i dont like on this album is under it all. Its to long and just hard to listen to for very long. But overal there are many incredible songs on here such as Building The Church with its awesome space like fretboard tapping, and Freak Show Excess is just a perfectly played song with a Jaw Dropping solo in the middle of it, K'm Pee Du Wee is a short and awesome song along with Lotus Feat?(i mean the damn song got him a grammy so its pretty good), and all the other songs on this album. And if your a true Vai fan you should enjoy this album easily. And if anyone really has listened to all of Vai's work you'll know he does not go one way with his music for long so if you are that down about the harder metal like music it will proably be comming back some time soon.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The best description of this musical came from Joel Grey who played the original cast's Wizard of Oz. He said Wicked is \\"a thinking man's Disney show that has more intelligence...wit and sophistication.\\"<br /><br />Wicked's music is highly engaging and this Original Cast Album has two incredible female leads Idina Menzel as Elpheba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda. The most memorable numbers are The Wizard and I, What is this Feeling, Popular, the show stopping Defying Gravity, No Good Deed and For Good, which always brings tears to my eyes.<br /><br />My deep \\"Gratitution\\" to Stephen Shwartz, Marc Platt, Winnie Holzman for creating this musical and ofcourse to Gregory Maguire who wrote the book that inspired it!
B00005JKOI|4.0|Although this is a part of the great John Hughes-Molly Ringwald fascination fest that gave us other 80s Teen Titans Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, the true gems here are the supporting performances by John Cryer and Annie Potts.  Cryer's lip-synch performance is worth the price of admission, as is his conversation with Andie's dad. Potts' never-grown-up record store manager is a great refusal of adulthood.  And don't forget a nice bit by a pre-annoying Andrew \\"Dice\\" Clay. <br /> <br />What's a John Hughes movie without a legendary soundtrack.  I'm hooked the moment the Psychadelic Furs kick into the title track.  The movie and the soundtrack are a must for any 80s collection.
B00005JNRY|4.0|The beginning of Cars is a little lame since the beginning race goes on a little too long and it's not either very entertaining or funny. The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.<br /><br />  At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film \\"thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak\\". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt all do fine jobs.
B00005JOQS|3.0|The reason to bring back Superman to film is because the movie technology is there to realize the potential of what special effects can do to the character in a live action movie.  That is the reason why George Lucas decided to do the next trilogy to his STAR WARS saga. The technology was there to bring his vision(s) to the screen.  SUPERMAN RETURNS misses the opportunity to realize what can be done with Superman with modern movie CGI.  What little they did in SUPERMAN RETURNS is great, but it wasn't enough.  The movie is an astounding 2 hrs and 37 minutes, but for some reason it seems like a hollow and empty shell of a movie. This reviewer remembers coming out psyched from the Spider-Man films and BATMAN BEGINS, but dissapointed cominig out of this film.  It has been touted by its creators that this new version is to pay homage to the Richard Donner films (Superman I and Superman II.--Actually, everyone is forgetting that Richard Lester is the credited director of Superman II.). One of the first problems facing this film is again, the Lex Luthor character.  Kevin Spacey chews up the scenery and is evil beyond comprehension.  However, we don't know why he is this way.  In SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2  (Spider-Man definitely has a better rouge's gallery than Superman), the villains are fully realized and fleshed out. In all the Superman films, Lex Luthor is evil with no thought behind the character except that he is evil and he is Superman's archenemy. After four films (including this one), it has become old and tiresome. In, SUPERMAN RETURNS, his obsession with land and real estate is brought over from the first two films as a plot motivation.  It is hilarious in a way, but also trite and annoying. In the first film he wanted California, in the second film he wanted Australia. This time, he wants to create his own continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean by using Kryptonian technology stolen from Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Note: If the creators wanted this to be \\"almost\\" a continuation of the first two movies, why not bring back the \\"Otis\\" and \\"Miss Teschmacher\\" characters. The next problem of the film is the relationship of the support characters. Brandon Routh does a great job as Clark Kent and Superman, but has little to do or say.  In the first movie and in the comic books themselves, part of the charm was the Clark Kent and Lois Lane relationship, which is badly absent in this movie.  Kate Bosworth does a fine job as Lois, but spends the whole movie ignoring or dissin' Clark and the two are rarely seen together interacting even as co-workers, collaborators, or old friends. He comes back after 5 years, and all Lois can say is \\"Oh! Hi, Clark! Welcome Back!\\" Her attitude towards Superman is even worse. The next problem is the support characters. Jimmy Olsen's total admiration society attitude for Clark Kent was not funny and is unwatchable. Jimmy Olsen should be played straight and mature instead of adolescent.  Jackie Cooper was a great Perry White and had more to say in the first two Superman movies. Frank Langella has no presence in this film whatsoever. Lastly the next problem is the character in Lois Lane's son.  Supposedly it is revealed that this son is a result of Superman's/Clark's and Lois' consummation at the Fortress of Solitude when Superman briefly gave up is powers (from Superman II). The creators have painted themselves in a corner by creating this character at least for the purposes of the proposed sequels. In the film, the character is pretty much a distraction and an annoyance with no relevance to the story or to the Superman mythos. Lastly (a nitpicking flaw) Superman claims he hears everything.  Why couldn't he hear Lex Luthor when Luthor was at his Fortress of Solitude or when he was planning his plot to create a continent out of Kryptonian crystals and Kryptonite? Overall, a 200 million dud-buster that was over-hyped and basically had nothing to say and nothing to show.  The creator's shouldhave started off fresh like what the creators did with the Batman franchise in BATMAN BEGINS. It's as if Bryan Singer helmed SUPERMAN RETURNS to purposely sabotage it so that he knew it wouldn't out perform his own X-Men franchise. If this movie was a homage to the Donner vision, why didn't they just get Richard Donner to direct the film? It's obvious he is still an able director and can direct sequels (i.e. his LETHAL WEAPON series!).have started off fresh like what the creators did with the Batman franchise in BATMAN BEGINS.

0446691437|3.0|This book started out really good. The first section on resistance is excellent, but then you start to get a feel for just how weird and negative this guy really is. From the personal anecdotes he gives involving his past, you'd think this guy was a complete loser. He didn't get anything published until his mid-forties, and says he was 'starving' until then. He talks about how he lived in a trailer crammed with garbage and that his neighbor (who slept in a trailer named 'moby dick') would teach him 'the evils of the marketplace'. He also worked in an oilfield and lived with a bunch of 'transient geeks' as he calls them, one of whom gave him yoga lessons at night. Not to mention he goes golfing with some scottish guy named 'the Hawk', worships his muse like a god, and believes in Zeus. He also says his prayer 'loud & in earnest' (mental image of him acting it out like a play at his desk). All in all, I'd say this guy is a bonafide fruitcake.  <br /> <br />Another thing is that I kept finding this guy contradicting himself on whether or not a professional should love his work. One minute he's saying that you have to truly love your work, the next that you should be completely detatched from it, and 'let the divines do their work'. He talks about the person as a vessel through which angels work their magic and bring already-realized pieces of art (in the heavens, that is) down here into our world for us all to enjoy. Going by that, he's saying that no work is really original, that it's all already laid out in heaven - we're just the lowly servants bringing it into reality. While I agree with this somewhat, it seems like he's discrediting the whole creative process entirely by saying that he just lets spirits work through him. I feel that there's a whole lot more to it than that, and I hope others do too.  <br /> <br />He also believes that writers who write for a target audience, and not for themselves, are 'hacks'. If you've read Stephen King's 'On Writing' or Dean Koontz's book, you'll realize that these two popular authors treat it like a profession, and therefore are 'hacks' in Pressfield's eyes. I don't agree with this...you can still write for an audience and throw in your own brand of originality, and you can keep food on the table and support a family. This guy believes in staying 'hardcore' and starving if need-be (and he ruined his marriage, as he states so matter-of-factly early on in the book).  <br />I also don't appreciate his apparent disdain for anyone who doesn't commit themselves fully to being an author, whom he calls 'amateurs'. I don't believe that someone who writes just as seriously on weekends and has a steady week job in a different avenue of creativity is simply 'amateur'. Actually, early on in the book he states that real professionals only take on tasks that are new to them, and never repeat things they've done before (no longer challenging). Is it really 'amateur' to take on different avenues of creativity, like sculpting, art, film, comics, game design, etc., as well as writing? This guy seems to believe only the hardcore purists are the real deal. Everyone else is just on the wrong path.  <br /> <br />Sigh. This book came highly recommended to me, and I was hoping it would have more than just a chapter's worth of genuine, sound advice. But in all honesty, this guy really isn't a great role model. If you're not bothered by being a 'starving artist' like this guy apparently was through most of his life, then maybe you'll identify with the later chapters. I, however, was a little ticked at his cynical, negative attitude and a little weirded out by all his greek god fantasies and pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo (and this guy actually claims he's a christian in the first chapter - a christian who prays to Zeus's daughter, and holds the Invocation of the Muse from Homer's Odyssey as his deepest prayer? Riiight).
B00005JOSS|3.0|I wouldn't recommend this movie because it really isn't that entertaining or good. The script was very poorly written for starters. The voice over parts are rather silly and hardly read with any real interest. The music is just plain terrible and thw acting is rather bland.
B000002OCP|4.0|It's funny how when it comes to the products that Amazon sells, company reviewers just happen to always write glowing reviews -except in this case. Here, Steven Stolder really picked the wrong recording to knock. \\"Electric Mud\\" isn't for everybody, but it's great for what it is. It sounds like the spirit of Jimi Hendrix possessed Muddy Waters for a session at Chess Records. This important album turned new generations of listeners onto the Blues. If you dig this album, then you must watch \\"Godfathers and Sons,\\" a film which is the fifth disc in Martin Scorsese's \\"The Blues: A Musical Journey.\\" In this documentary, Marshall Chess (the producer for \\"Electric Mud\\") explains the history of the project to none other than Chuck D.  Furthermore, the film captures the reunion of the Electric Mud band with the addition of a DJ and rapper. If you've been able to put aside the negative reviews and find a place in your heart for \\"Electric Mud,\\" the film is essential. As for me, I picked the disc up after watching the film. I am happy that the film turned me onto such a unique recording.
B000002UAX|5.0|When I first layed eyes on the plain white cover and the simple lettering of \\"The Beatles\\" I thought it was some kind of joke. Then when I heard it I new it was far from it.  The tracks do seem arranged quite out of order but it also adds to the effect. Before I talk about the music I want to touch upon the 3 issues taht every White Album review has to have. They are: <br />1. Revolution 9 <br />2. \\"Paul is Dead\\" <br />3. Charles Manson <br /> Revolution 9 is a collage of odd and random sounds and voices. You either love it or hate it. From 2 different standpoints it could either be an artistic and interesting piece of music or... a waste of space and time on a perfectly fine CD. <br /> This leads me into my next topic. Yes, it is true. If you play Rev. 9 backwards you can hear \\"it\\". \\"It\\" being the single most talked about hidden secret on a rock album. You can hear the sounds of sirens, a car crash, people screaming, and the infamous, strange, and ominus voice sayin the haunting lines \\"I buired Paul today\\". <br /> My final topic is the Charles Manson murders. They were apparently influenced by this album (I'm sure the Beatles are happy wuth that on their consience). \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Piggies\\" being big ones. <br /> And now onto the music (if your still with me). The CD pulls together nicely. My fav tracks are Revolution 1, Helter Skelter, Yer Blues, and Glass Onion. BUY IT!  <br /> <br />

B00005JOX6|4.0|Having read all the bad critical reviews for this I went in to this film not expecting much.  This movie is way better than what has been written about it.  This is one of Sandler's best performances (along with Spanglish) as Michael Newman (hey, that's my name too!) a struggling father who has no time for his kids and wife because he devouts all of his time to his demanding worklife.  In a tale that combines the lessons of The Monkey's Paw and It's a Wonderful Life, Newman comes across his own Angel (Christopher Walken) in the \\"Beyond\\" section of Bed Bath and Beyond.  Walken playing the wierd Morty, has just what Newman needs and that is a remote control that can change Newman's life.  Walken lets Newman know the caveat which is that the remote is non-returnable once accepted.  Not being familiar with The Cat's Paw tale (where every gift has a catch) Newman starts using the remote to help him skip uncomfortable situations in life that prevent him from getting to his ultimate goal (to get some work done without the distractions of family obligations). <br /> <br />Each time Newman thinks he has succeeded he has unforeseen circumstances thrown at him by his demanding boss (David Hasselhoff).   The movie has some very touching moments especially from Newman's well-meaning father (Henry Winkler).  When Newman finally learns that the things that the remote is causing him to avoid, are really the things that he wants to experience the most, it may be too late to change his mind. <br /> <br />A really fun and touching movie!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid! It is one of those movies that draw kids into it. I bought this movie for my four kids and  <br />they didn't budge from the t.v. threw the whole movie. I've got VERY active kids, so that is a miricle in itself. Awesome movie. I suggest this movie for anyone young or old, that is into action-packed adventure.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Superb casting and dark, realistic character storyline make this one of the best crime dramas ever.<br /><br />Deniro's character really deep inside does not want to live anymore since life as he knew it is basically over (the life of crime that drives him). He is also in love and does not understand that and does not know how to deal with it. He makes a stupid mistake at the end letting his emotions cloud his decision making, but is it really a mistake or a death wish in disguise?<br /><br />Pacino fulfills his wish.<br /><br />Pacino's character is just as driven but in the opposite direction. Two sides of the same coin, same coin, different face. Just as Deniro cannot let go of what is killing him neither can Pacino. It takes Deniro's life and leaves Pacino alive but missing the best of life, thus he is also dead, the walking dead.
B00008URYM|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, I'm a bit biased when it comes to Madonna and her music. I'm a HUGE fan. However; since she is such prolific artist, it is sometimes very difficult to collect ALL of her albums and singles. This particular CD single is one example of the \\"What do I buy?\\" question. The big problem: It's short. Clocking in at a total of just over 13 minutes this CD features ONLY two songs, one of which you could of heard on the radio, the radio edit of an \\"Amercian Life\\". The redeeming quality is the second song, a VERY good dance mix of the James Bond movie theme \\"Die Another Day\\" by Calderone & Quayle. Value oriented people may like the price. The CD only costs 4 bucks. But for the NON-hardcore listener, pass on this CD single and get the MAXI-single, which as four more songs and is only 3 bucks more.
B000001AFY|5.0|Just relax to the song \\"I thought it took a little time\\" this album is timeless. Here it is several years from the orginal re-lease date and I am jammin this CD as if it was released today. It's a CD thats legendary. Miss Ross put down the lyrics that will follow our hearts forever. So ask yourself? \\"Do you know where you're going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you?\\" When you listen to the lyrics of this album you definately get what you're hoping for, good music is still alive. Do you know?
0312323859|5.0|this is a perfect bookend to the story started in something borrowed (both of which i read over one weekend!). i loved reading darcy's side of the story and found her to be a lot more compelling and interesting character than i expected. giffin does a great job of describing darcy's fall and rise and the story will transform your opinion of darcy in much the same way that darcy transforms herself throughout the book (you'll go from hating her and revelling in her fall from grace at the beginning to genuinely caring for and loving her by the end of the book). giffin tells another excellent story that takes you close to hating darcy and writing her off altogether, but then shows that everyone has redeeming qualities and the capability of reforming and changing for the better. i also liked that the end of the book, while wrapping things up between rachel and darcy, doesn't take the easy way out and really makes you think about how friendships change and break and heal throughout our lives.    it's not necessary to read something borrowed before reading this book, but i would recommend that you try to read that one first. it gives the story about the friendship between darcy and rachel the context and depth to really appreciate both of these fantastic novels.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|After seeing the original David Lynch version of the film, the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, and now this extended edition, the obvious conclusion is this -- you cannot compellingly tell the story of Dune in a motion picture format and expect to keep it anywhere close to intact. <br /> <br />The evidence? Even with more than three hours of screen time, every director who has tried to tell the story has been forced to use the amateur, Lucasian technique of showing, not telling, and that has one effect on viewers -- it puts us to SLEEP.  <br /> <br />Seriously. I fell asleep twice watching this mess of a movie before I was able to make it through the entire thing. <br /> <br />And for the uninitiated, cramming in as many possible references to Bene Gesserits, Mentats and Kwisatz Haderachs doesn't make the story seem appealing -- it just makes it seem like it was written by a lunatic with a penchant for ridiculous-sounding names and long-winded plots. <br /> <br />So what's there to like about this movie? It's beautiful, not only by science fiction standards (and for the fact that it was released in 1984), but for the \\"noir baroque\\" style and the incredible detail on some of the sets. The decision to use \\"Weirding Modules\\" was a bizarre one, but actually pans out later in the movie as the battle scenes bring some excitement to the screen. And if you like the series, despite its many flaws, the movie is an interesting retelling of the Dune story. If you're a fan of Dune this is probably worth picking up. If you're not, watching this movie means you're guaranteed to be confused.

Buble's voice reminds me of Sinatra at his prime time. Buble can indeed sing and has an impressive control of his voice and delivary. And thanks to Foster, the whole production is wonderful and gives a fresh sound to the masterpieces from past generations. <br /> <br />Definitely worth buying for me. <br />On a side note, Buble sounds better live than on his CD.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|We purchased this for purely nostalgic reasons, to introduce our teanager to the Beatles & as a trip down memory lane for her old fogey parents.  We're not recording experts so we don't have a clue whether this is a good one or not, but it serves its purpose for us in giving us a taste of the Beatles.  Nice selection of songs, & having them in chronological order is a plus.  If you're a Beatles purist, stick to the original albums, but if a sampler's what you need, this will serve well.

630469654X|4.0|Certain movies are instantly classics. Back when I first saw this movie at the theater I was fairly impressed but I thought Matthew Broderick was not cast right for it and the music was techy. Since then I honestly think the reason I thought that about Broderick was I associated him with Ferris Bueller to much, and I have learned to accept the music too. Even though Broderick is to well spoken for his part and sounds a bit like Ferris, the music is a bit techno-new age, and Pfeiffer makes a couple non-period language slips, it still is just beautiful. The camera work was exceptional and the director must have done a fine job with this wonderful story because along with the beauty of the camera work the acting, sets, and scenery are great.<br /><br />I have probably seen every fantasy movie made in the last 40 years and this is one of the best. If you are a fan of well crafted fantasy movies like \\"Princess Bride\\" and \\"Ever After\\" I suggest you see this one. It has slipped by many since it was made so long ago. Typically most people that did not originally see this at the theater or on TV catch it by word of mouth. I highly recommend it. If you haven't seen this in awhile I think you will enjoy seeing it again and you first time viewers are in for a treat from a young Matthew Broderick, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />The plot is basicly a knight and a lady are banished because of their love for each other when the bishop had designs on the lady himself. The good news is the two lovers are together. The bad news is one is always an animal thanks to a curse by the bishop. One is a hawk by day and the other a wolf by night. In walks a petty thief played by Broderick that wiles them, and then is actually touched by their trajedy. He comes up with a plan to make things right. Only one disappointment, this DVD is your normal cheap cardboard box with no extras on the DVD. Keep your eye peeled for a special edition as this has been out long enough that they come out with anniversary editions.niversary editions.

0312323859|4.0|I have tried desperately to like Emily Giffin's books Something Borrowed and Baby Proof, but neither of them struck the right chord with me.  As she seems to be a critical favorite right now, I thought that maybe I just didn't get it.  Not so, I learned after finishing this wonderful follow-up to Something Borrowed in just one day.  The plot is stronger and flows better. The characers are the same, but for some reason it just works better this time around.  Darcy is everything that I normally hate in a chick-lit heroine: spoiled, shallow, self-absorbed. I found myself thinking, \\"This is it. If she turns over a new leaf, like some freaking Lifetime Movie, I am done with Emily Giffin and I will just have to let it go.\\"  Luckily, that wasn't the case and I could actually enjoy the journey instead of worrying about a trite chick-lit ending.  In my estimation, this is the best of Giffin's three novels, though I would suggest reading Something Borrowed first for a bit of context.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I know this subject has been brought up again and again, still, after viewing Brokeback Mountain, I still cannot understand why this movie lost over Crash. Sure, the simple minded would be bored by this movie since nothing about this movie suggest a Pop or Rock nature that young people today seem to degrade themselves to. Still, this movie shows true emotion, master craftmanship, and dedication which Crash, though well intentioned, cannot match! Regardless of Oscar's decision, this movie probably invoked the most amount of support out of all the movies within the last decade, and if times were different, this movie would definitely win the Best Pictures of the year.

Sure I program out a few songs...only because I prefer no vocals...so I program out fine performances of Black Magic Woman & Oye Como Va; and track two on CD two, a long drum solo, can be programmed out; etc... But the rest is brilliant, spiritual, intense & magical.  This is music of enlightened beings.

0156421178|5.0|Although Orwell hardly needs another review...  Orwell's matter of fact style lends clarity and provides a rare insight into a complex period when the revolution that effectively saved the Republic from the Nationalist uprising was being subsumed by Communist centralism.  Somebody had to be scapegoated, and in a way we are all fortunate that one of the greatest authors happened to be among the P.O.U.M. scapegoats, providing us a view of history that few other survived to write about.  For an additional view of this history, watch Ken Loach's \\"Land and Freedom\\".
B000E1YVZU|5.0|My family loves musicals. I have seen several, but I have yet to see this one on broadway. My grandmother is probably the reason for that, or my mother. One of them did not find the broadway show too good or interesting. So when I went to see this movie, I was a little iffy. <br />Right away in the movie you are thrown into \\"SEASONS OF LOVE,\\" which was the class above mine's graduation song and then \\"RENT\\" the song. I was hooked from then on. I think Tracie Thoms has the most amazing voice and adding Rosario Dawson was a smart move. I have seen the two from the original cast and they were great, but it is probably because I have seen the movie that I prefer Tracie and Rosario.  <br />I am glad they redid the music soundtrack into more modern music than leaving it as 80s. It may sound cliché but I do believe it reaches my generation better. Some people I know complain about it being too long of a movie in itself, but they love  the music by itself.  <br />The 2-Disc is amazing. If you own it, watch Rent with the commentary on; it is hilarious. Watch the short movie about Johnathan Larson- it will make you teary eyed. Watch all the deleted scenes- my favorite song is in one of them. No matter how depressing the movie is, and believe me I know it is, it is still amazing.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Phantom of the Opera on stage is my favorite musical. I have seen it multiple times since i was 12 and love it. So when the movie came out, I was more than eagered to see it. <br />The first time you watch this movie it is magical. It takes the stage production and gives more depth to the story. The costumes and stages are nothing short of beautiful. I believe Christine and the Phantom where casted well, along with most of the other cast, but I did not agree with Raoul. He always looked ready to cry and extremely weak to my likings.  <br />I bought the DVD when it came out and sat down to watch it again. As I watched it, something was bugging me. PArts of the movie did not line up with the actual musical. I haven't read the book yet, so maybe it lines up with the book? About have way into the movie I got a little bored. I am not easily bored with movies- heck I even work at a movie theatre! But the movie just seems to lose its edge in the middle. The ending is still great- minus the chandaler being dropped in the wrong spot (that bugs me the most!)  <br />All in all, I recommend this movie, but it might be disappointing.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Director:  Francis Ford Coppola <br />Cast:  Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper. <br />Running Time:  202 minutes <br />Rated R for Rated R for disturbing violent images, language, nudity, sexual content and some drug use. <br /> <br />We hear \\"Apocalypse Now\\" before we see it. The low 'whup-whup-whup' of a helicopter's propellers is audible over a black screen, which slowly reveals a lush, exotic forest. The camera holds a long shot on this peaceful scene before the forest explodes into a fiery inferno as the napalm attack is launched. On the soundtrack, Jim Morrison tells us that \\"This is the end\\" and we are sucked instantly into the mad, horrible, wonderful world of \\"Apocalypse Now\\".  The 1979 film is Francis Ford Coppola's loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', scripted by John Milius, and updated to take place in the Vietnam War. The story concerns an American soldier named Willard (Martin Sheen) who is living a drunken, tortured existence in a Saigon hotel room while waiting for his next mission. Soon he is called into action (\\"I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one\\") and given the task of assassinating a decorated Colonel who has gone AWOL. Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is in fact living as a kind of god to a local tribe on a compound deep in the Jungle. Willard must travel upriver and \\"terminate - with extreme prejudice\\". <br /> <br />Well that's one story anyway. The other, more incredible tale surrounding \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is how this film got made. There's the story of a six-week shoot that lasted for sixteen months. How Harvey Keitel was cast in the role of Willard and replaced after two weeks by Martin Sheen, who promptly had a breakdown (captured on film for the opening sequence) and suffered a near-fatal heart attack. Then there's the typhoon that struck the Philippines and destroyed most of the film's sets, putting Coppola (\\"The Godfather\\" trilogy) even further behind schedule. Coppola ended up plowing most of his personal fortune into the film, risking bankruptcy, his marriage and his reputation on a project which was out of control. As he said himself: \\"We made the film like America fought in Vietnam - We had too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane\\". It's astonishing that Coppola could salvage anything remotely coherent from the chaotic circumstances in which \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was made. In fact he produced a masterpiece; an intoxicating, utterly singular audio-visual experience which blows away the timid ambitions of most American war films. Aided by the great editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and the glorious cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, Coppola made \\"Apocalypse Now\\" less of a typical war movie and more of a hallucinogenic trip down the river of a young man's mind and soul.  That young man is Martin Sheen, who plays the introspective Willard to perfection, but his performance is unquestionably eclipsed by some of those around him. In a few short scenes Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore seems to sum up everything \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is about; the madness, power and machismo. To see Kilgore standing tall, admiring the waves, while all those around him duck to avoid the flying bullets and explosions, is to witness one of modern cinema's most memorable characterizations. Kilgore is blessed with some of the film's most memorable lines - \\"Charlie don't surf\\", \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\\" - and is at the center of 'Apocalypse Now''s greatest sequence. The helicopter attack, accompanied by Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries', is one of the most incredible pieces of filmmaking in history. Spectacular, horrific and undeniably thrilling, the attack is masterfully orchestrated by Coppola and is even more satisfying in these days of CGI and digital fakery. It's a high point from which the film, for a while, fails to recover. <br /> <br/>The rest of the film has an increasingly looming shadow cast over it. Willard and his crew slowly make their way up the river to confront Kurtz, and the anticipation of Brando's appearance grows. Brando turned up late, overweight and had read neither the script nor the source material. To hide his bulk, Coppola shot him in semi-darkness, with the light glinting off his enormous shaved head. It turns Kurtz into mythical figure, and Brando's portrayal suits the character of Kurtz, a man drunk on power, broken by warfare.  In 2001 Coppola produced a director's cut entitled 'Apocalypse Now Redux', adding 49 minutes of deleted footage to his original masterwork. Some of this footage was welcome (More Duvall, more Brando, the Playboy bunnies), while the long, politically motivated French plantation sequence adds little to the film and detracts from the film's narrative. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was a film made by people out of their minds, with the odds stacked against them, and the film reflected that background - it's what made it so special. \\"Redux\\"' is an attempt to make sense of an insane film by people who have had time to reflect, to mature, and their attempts only manage to dilute some of the original's edge.  Nevertheless, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a film that everyone should see in some form, a true masterpiece which reveals new layers and aspects with each repeat viewing. Will we ever see the like of it again? I doubt it. The film is the ultimate apotheosis of 70's filmmaking - a drug-fuelled, self-indulgent, daring piece of work which is so filled with ambition it almost collapses under its own weight. There is no denying the film's raw power and many of the trademark set pieces will never be forgotten or equaled. It's an awesome paradox of a movie; crazy, insightful, overblown and intimate all at once. In it's own unique and magnificent way, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" reflects the madness, intensity and \\"the horror, the horror\\" of warfare.  <br />
B00011F5DK|5.0|I only bought this game because it was recommended to me time and time again. It looked boring and simplistic, but I figured there must be something I wasn't seeing. And there was! It is a great game! All of my kids can play it and challenge each other and me. This game does not necessarily favor the oldest(and supposedly wisest?) player. My seven year-old can beat the pants of me. <br /> <br />It also gets the brain working in non-traditional ways. You have to look at the grid in unique ways. The pieces aren't lined up in rows and columns like most games. You connect pieces by the corners. So sometimes you can connect a piece in an area that looks like it is totally bocked by your opponent. <br /> <br />And of course there is the strategy... I still haven't decided which is the best piece to start off with.  <br /> <br />The game also takes a nice length of time, not too long and not too short.
B000FBGBPC|3.0|It's typical that most bands end up lagging down to the typical machinations of the recording industry with their sophomore efforts.  As an industry standard, it's sad to watch, and most careers are either make or break.  Bands like Staind propelled to musical heights with their \\"major label sophomore\\" album, and for good reason.  The musicianship went through the roof, and the band stood together and made classic songs.  Now, with the release of Three Days Grace, it seems that another band has instead fallen victim to the sophomore slump.  Regardless of what all the MTV teens will tell you in their own Amazon.com reviews on this record (which I already have problems with the fact that every album seems to get five stars), this effort just doesn't stand up to their debut album, and honestly, it isn't a good sign of things to come. <br /> <br />The first thing most people will flock to is their single, \\"Animal I Have Become\\", which is a rather funny song when you think about it.  In their previous single \\"Just Like You\\", they talked about a duality between not being like the past generation of their fathers and mothers, while at the same time, talking about how they refuse to be like all the other bands out there with their radio singles.  It was the promise of \\"I Hate Everything About You\\" that made the band seem so good and warm and easy to grip onto.  However, they've fallen into cookie cutter fashion by providing exactly what the record company wanted:  a single.  Sadly, the album follows in the same suit, rather than offering up more than maybe two songs worth of advanced musicianship. <br /> <br />As you continue on the record, you'll find songs like \\"Pain\\" and \\"Never Too Late\\", which do nothing better to disprove the failings of this record.  Not only do they follow a by-the-numbers idea of a rock song, but they take the band far away from their emotional and evocative feel on the first album.  Instead, they get even closer to being that little band on TRL that has to entertain all the little kiddies with stories of anger and atypical pieces of lyrical content that can be found on any random CD you pick up from the shelves at Best Buy. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Riot\\" and \\"Time of Dying\\" are gems on the album, but still, they never reach the same emotional level as previous tracks on their last record like \\"Take Me Under\\" or \\"Wake Up\\".  Still, they hold enough of the good parts of the cookie cutter rock band while offering their own unique style of downbeat and crunch heavy flair to keep you attached.  The drum work, guitar rhythms and some of the slightly off-time signatures, and more over, the inspired lyrics make them true treasures to find embedded into the tracklisting. <br /> <br />Then again, there are flat out weak offerings that turn the disc into a bit of a farce, also.  When you look at songs like the pathetically underwhelming title track \\"One X\\", or even try to submit yourself to the wretched rip-off of \\"Just Like You\\" that they call \\"Gone Forever\\" (at least in the chorus), you have to question whether this band really cares about the music they are writing. <br /> <br />Such a good guitar sound, solid drumming, and unique vocals carried the first album, but only a few times is it ever displayed on this album.  Hopefully, the next effort is better.  No, I'm not going to break down each song for you and rate them, because that's just retarded.  If I wanted to rate a single, then I'd criticize the radio.  Here, I'm speaking about an album, and while \\"It's All Over\\" is a pretty decent song and solid opener for most bands, Three Days Grace can do so much better than what is heard on One X.  We know this, only because they did a better album last time around.  Take precaution in checking out this album, as it'll be for everyone that \\"matters\\" and only mediocre, if not bland, for those true to the ways of rock 'n' roll.

B000E97Y6K|1.0|Given the level of creativity and the seamless implementation of WETA's effects, I expected much more from this movie than a long overdrawn saga.  The story was okay, but hindered badly by the poor integration of live-action and cg.  I mean, the compositing was just plain lousy and the movements of the large creatures weren't scaled well at all.  I was so distracted during the scene in which the characters are running from the herd of brachiosaurs (or whatever they were) by the obvious fakery of the images that I couldn't see past it.  Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong.  I don't expect to see this kind of crap on screen when it comes from the same people who were behind LOTR. <br /> <br />In short, King Kong was overhyped, overbudgeted, underproduced and overall underwhelming.  The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology:  Jurassic Park.  Let's hope that Peter Jackson decides to take on something less classic and less demanding on the audience.
B000067DNC|5.0|Okay, so I might be a little bit biased, but I love Stargate and I have to say that I totally enjoyed every minute of this first season. I highly recommend it to all sci-fi lovers.  You will absolutely adore the characters--Jack is of course my favorite because heck, that guy is funny.  Always good for a laugh.  But don't take my word for it, buy the DVDs!
B000F3TBIO|2.0|Mike Patton is practically a one-man genre, having so much going on in so many different styles. <br />The most anticipated one has been Peeping Tom. <br />Which, in hindsight, I think is a shame. <br />In my opinion, Peeping Tom is the least interesting album he has put out. (Ignoring the Adult Themes and Maldoror stuff). <br />What do I think is wrong with Peeping Tom? <br />The music sounds outdated, its a throwback to nineties Massive Attack style Triphop, but it lacks the moody, dark,  <br />and sinister feel of it. It is watered down triphop. <br />Mike Patton's \\"rapping\\" sounds like he's imitating himself at the age of 15. (Then again, 99% of Hiphop nowadays sounds like  <br />adults dumbing themselves down to impress the kiddies). <br />The lyrics are TERRIBLE. The important thing is Mike's delivery, true, but on his other records, WHEN he writes lyrics, he does a damn good job...not so here. \\"When I come around, I'll bring you the crown\\"??...\\"Starbucks\\" references?? This is the guy that wrote \\"Midlife Crisis\\"? <br />The main attraction for everybody was to hear the man sing. <br />But the songs come across as poorly written, 90s regurgitated and ultimately CORNY. If you want to hear him sing his *ss off-try Tomahawk. <br />I gave it a 2.5 because this guy has an incredible menu of albums, from Tomahawk to Mr Bungle, Fantomas, back to F.N.M., collabs with Eyvind Kang, Dillinger Escape Plan, Lovage... <br />COMPARED TO ALL THAT- <br /> Peeping Tom sounds like the Patton equivalent of the Happy Meal for kids. Fast food for mass consumption.  <br />I know I'm gonna get lynched now... <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is as good or better as Aenima, which is one of my favorite albums ever.
0684857219|5.0|Encyclopedia is an understatement.  Charts, graphs, history, images, meal plans, workout programs, and on top of that, I was certain it was going to be a \\"I AM ARNOLD THE GOD\\" book, he certainly gives credit when credit is due and gives thanks, praise and inside info on his experience and personal outlooks.  He will show many training/bodybuilding accepted methods of things, but then he'll give his own insight and version of excercises. There's even info divided into sections from just a beginner or up to the PRO.  I recommend it even if you do not plan on picking up ONE weight, very cool book.
B00004YM0D|4.0|I saw where others have said that a song was missing...but I also noticed \\"Fire and Rain\\" By James Taylor is not on it either? What's up with that? I'm gonna have to watch again to see if anything else is missing. What a great great soundtrack...and I LOVED this movie!
B000005H4X|4.0|This was my introduction to Bu in my college days, and in retrospect it barely scratches the surface. For a follow-up, pick up the eponymous collection on Columbia with Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd. Also, be certain your Blakey collection generously represents, among trumpet players, Clifford Brown, Kenny Dorham, Freddie Hubbard, and Bill Hardman (not to mention Valery Ponomarev, Wynton Marsalis, and Terrence Blanchard). As for saxophonists, Golson, despite his compositional talents, is one of the lesser players to occupy that spot in a Blakey ensemble. Even when it comes to composers, if there's a \\"genius\\" among the Blakey contributors, it's Walter Davis, Jr. \\"Jodie,\\" \\"Ronnie's a Dynamite Lady,\\" \\"Backgammon,\\" \\"Uranus,\\" \\"Gypsy Folk Tales,\\" \\"Scorpio Rises\\"--these are all Davis compositions that Blakey saw fit to record--challenging, adventurous material that places Blakey in the forefront of modern, progressive music, a musicmaker beyond category as opposed to being simply leader of jazz' foremost \\"hard bop\\" ensemble.<br /><br />It's not easy to find, but look for another \\"Moanin'\\" on Laserlight. Recorded live, it features Hardman playing the title song like there was no tomorrow along with a cadenza on \\"Blue Moon\\" that Freddie, who introduced the tune on \\"3 Blind Mice,\\" could have played only in his dreams. Another good introduction to Hardman's trumpet artistry is the Italian LP, \\"Art's Break,\\" on which Art stops the band while Bill plays for half a dozen choruses unaccompanied.<br /><br />That's jazz. That's the inexhaustible world of Art Blakey.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Disassociate this movie from the book by Isaac Asimov. The movie contains the three laws of robotics, from Asimov's classic book, and the flaw in the three laws, but that's about all it borrows from the book. Nevertheless, it is a fun action flick with enough suspense to keep you interested to the very end. <br /> <br />Will Smith does a good job as the police officer with an ax to grind against robots and James Cromwell is always a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br />It's a good, fun movie that will keep you guessing till the end! 4 stars. <br />

B00005K3O4|4.0|We caught the last half of Killer Klowns from Outer Space while flipping channels and got a good laugh out of it. The premise was just so silly and the clowns so ridiculous that we laughed most of the way through it. The clowns came up with all kinds of clever ways to kill their victims, all variations of silly clown tricks.  <br /> <br />The movie doesn't try to be anything other than it is, even the acting is stupidly bad, but that's okay because it is all great fun. 4 stars! <br />
0977326403|5.0|Jim Collins has hit the nail squarely on the head. This monograph should be mandatory reading for all nonprofit staff and volunteers who want to by truly great.
0792839692|4.0|This 1976 science fiction film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way.  The premise is a future society in which life spans are limited to 30 years, through forced euthanasia, although the plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally.  The symbolism can be read in several ways.  At one level, the film attacks organized religion for keeping people docile with the promise of an imaginary afterlife.  At another, it implies that material comforts reduce the ability to think critically.  But what Logan's run offers primarily is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state.  There are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death.  The world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic.  The environment is a kind of shallow, Disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape.  The implicit subtext of the movie, that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap, is well taken.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|For years, fans of the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy have been waiting for George Lucas to release the unaltered version of the movies. And we finally get it on DVD, in its original aspect ratio! And, just in case you didn't get the first boxset of the enhanced original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, you get the enhanced versions with them! But unfortunately...    George Lucas does NOTHING to make the quality of the UNALTERED versions better.    1. The widescreen is NOT anamorphic (which means the picture will be very narrow on your widescreen TV).  2. The picture, although it's clear, is not digitally remastered.  3. The sound is not enhanced. Dolby Digital 2.0. The sound can be very meshy, and might not be effective if you have surround sound.    George Lucas said he did not intend to release the original versions. It's obvious he wasn't very proud of them. And ONLY just because of mad fan protest, he gives them a quick release, but shows his fans that he doesn't care that much about the original versions.    It's a great product to have if you're a die-hard fan, still. I would only recommend just buying the enhanced version boxset if you're a casual fan.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious, and the \\"Scottie doesn't know song\\" very cool tune. I'd recommend this movie for anyone who loves to sit down not analyze, but just enjoy a movie.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I was glued to the screen when I watched \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: A young protege actress is taught by a mysterious Angel of Music, who's beginning to make demands of everyone...<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some mild bad language, a few skimpy costumes, violent and disturbing scenes, deformities, a scene of mooning, scenes of seduction, themes of possesion.<br /><br />Characters: 4 of 5 stars. Some amazing acting in this, I thought. The Phantom and Christine were cast well. (The girl playing Christine was only 16 when this was filmed!) You feel for the Phantom, and understand Christine's temptation. Minnie Driver as Carlotta was really funny. My only complaint was that Patrick Wilson was a little too soft-faced and perfect-looking for his part.<br /><br />Plot: 5 of 5 stars. Enough plot to analyze, but not enough to get lost in. There's lots of intrigue, musical numbers, action, pathos, and romance. The end result of the story is very powerful. It's easy to see why this is such a beloved musical on Broadway.<br /><br />Cinematography: 4 of 5 stars. I couldn't see it all because I was watching a full-screen DVD, but I could tell that the sets were well crafted and the lighting excellent. Love the candles.<br /><br />Music: 5 of 5 stars. One of the most important parts of a musical. (Duh!) The songs and underscoring perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I found it to be memorable and exciting, though all the songs kind of melded to be indistinguishable one from the other.<br /><br />Impact: 5 of 5 stars. Let me first say that I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and I hate opera in general. That doesn't stop a good movie, though. I got heavily involved in this movie, and it was almost a tear-jerker. The end leaves you wondering a little, and given the movie, I didn't mind. I thought about this movie long after I watched it. The Phantom of the Opera is inside of my mind now.<br /><br />All in all, 4.5 of 5 stars.f the Opera is inside of my mind now. <br /> <br />All in all, 4.5 of 5 stars.
B00005RHGL|5.0|One of the best movies out there . They definitly need more like this!!!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|Director Francis Ford Coppola once said of his epic movie, \\"My film is not about Vietnam...it IS Vietnam.\\"  This can be grossly misinterpreted.  Whether or not you agree with America's actions in the Vietnam War, it is obvious that our soldiers were not as outlandish and insane as they are portrayed to be in \\"Apocalypse Now Redux.\\"  The actions and attitudes of the soldiers of the film aren't accurate in reflecting the real-life men who actually served in the war, but instead reflect the characteristics of the war itself-madness, evil, hate, etc.  So this film, as a matter of fact, is Vietnam, more from a psychological standpoint than a physical one. <br />     Starting with the opening hallucination/dream sequence, complete with napalm explosions and the continuous \\"thwock thwock\\" sound of approaching helicopters, \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" dives deep into a dark, unforgettable head-trip of a movie and never resurfaces.   <br />     Captain Willard(Martin Sheen) is ordered to locate Colonel Walter Kurtz(Marlon Brando), who, to put it mildly, has fallen off his rocker.  According to intelligence, Kurtz has gone outside military regulations and formed his own renegade army.  Once he locates Kurtz, Willard's job is to \\"terminate...with extreme prejudice.\\"  The rest of the film, in a nutshell,  chronicles Willard's adventures and interactions with many strange and despicable characters.  As he gets closer and closer to his objective, he becomes more and more obsessed with Kurtz.    <br />     While the content of the movie is violent, there was not as much on-screen bloodshed as I had been led to believe.  Like I said, the film is much more of a psychological metaphor.  Psychological or not, \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" truly is an unforgettable viewing experience.  One aspect of the film that really impressed me was the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, which gave the landscape a lush, yet deadly, image.  None of the actors particularly stuck out, even Robert Duvall's well-known character Kilgore(\\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning...\\") didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Not that the acting was bad, but the film owes more to the story, which is heavily based on Joseph Conrad's famous \\"Heart of Darkness\\", than to its cast.   <br />     Amidst the napalm explosions, \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" is one movie that will leave a lasting impression on your mind, for it IS Vietnam, from, of course, a psychological standpoint. <br /> <br />DVD features...Pretty slim.  Only a theatrical trailer, but I have heard that a two-disc version of the film will be released in August.  Besides, the movie's length takes up a majority of the disc.  Sound and picture are both pretty good.              <br />
B000002JSJ|5.0|It might not be their greatest album, but comparisons to the Untitled (IV) album aren't fair--that album is as perfect as music can be.  Nevertheless, if you want to hear the heaviness of Led Zeppelin, this is the one for you.  Back to the basics for the foursome.  As others have said, get it for Achilles' Last Stand and Nobody's Fault but Mine.  Also, don't forget the classic blues Tea for One.  The song was written by Plant as he was seperated from his wife due to the car accident.  The song is amazing and the solo is fantastic.  Good enough for a young Joe Bonamassa to cover it in 2006.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|I have been a huge John Williams fan for as long as I can remember.  And to give an example of how big a fan I am, I am open enough to appreciate any variation, or interpretation of his music.  I love hearing peoples different takes on his music.  And one thing I love about Williams is he is constantly updating.  It seems that when he makes a new recording of a previous recording, he has changed some of the instrumentation to keep it fresh sounding. <br /> <br />     I thouroughly enjoyed the movie, and I thought the music was beautiful.  Sure, I was disappointed that Williams didn't continue the superman epic, but I don't think enough people are giving this score enough credit.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie was breathtaking from start to finish.  Johnny Depp, as usual, proves that no matter what type of character he plays, he plays it well (ok, except for Willy Wonka, which seemed like a bad impression of Michael Jackson!).  And for the boys, they were incredible, especially Freddie Highmore, who I want to steal and make him my own kid!  He has exceptional talent: you smile when he smiles and you cry when he cries.  Kate Winslet, is gorgeous, despite the fact that she is sick in the movie.  Dustin Hoffman also gives some funny line while looking very rigid!  This movie has some very silly parts that has you laughing like a kid and it also had some very serious parts, which will have you weeping.  Both sides of the movie are fantastic and the best part is that you won't find a lot of cursing to ruin a good movie.  I think this shows Hollywood that you don't need filth to make a great movie.  It's all about the plot and the actors.  As far as whether everything in this movie is accurate I'm not sure that it really matters.  The movie says that it is based on true events, so like any kind of movie like that, you will find artistic liberty to make a story more entertaining.  The point is that you will find what the impact of innocent, playful children can have on the imagination of adults.  The end result of course, is Peter Pan, one of the most celebrated and revered children stories of all time.  So grab your tissues and be prepared for an outstanding movie that never drags...it just keeps you wanting more!
0553277472|5.0|I am an engineer that has been doing some soul searching for about a year now.  I came about this book and just consumed it.  It spoke to so many things that I have been feeling, and helped me open new areas for existential exploration.  A must read for anyone who just can't put their finger on IT, whatever IT is.  The perspective the author presents is not necessarily the correct one, but it helped me learn more about my perspective on life and living.
B000B7QAHO|2.0|First things first, I absolutely loved the original and it's hard not to judge this movie against the original version.  And second, I think Johnny Depp is an incredible actor, someone who chooses roles that interest him or challenge him, rather than trying to make quick cash.  And thirdly, I thought Freddie Highmore, like in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" was absolutely incredible.  With all that being said, this movie was close to being a disaster!  On paper, this should probably work - Depp can be weird and is highly enjoyable when he is at his zaniness.  And Tim Burton is known for his strange films and the great shades of colors that he puts onto his film.  And Highmore, as I already mentioned, is a natural talent.  So where does this go wrong?  Depp is just TOO weird in this movie, subconsciously channelling an eerie Michael Jackson.  His whole looks in this move made me feel put-off and distracted me from enjoying other elements of the film.  And the backstory with Christopher Lee as the strict dentist father did nothing for me either.  It was a good idea, but I felt like it was executed poorly.  The other children, too, seemed too much like the originals.  I felt like they should have mixed it up more, maybe something other than a white kid (that's not racist, b/c I am white also).  A lot of the aspects were so similar to the original I began to ask myself, \\"What is the point?\\"  I do agree, however, that Highmore is much more enjoyable than the original Charlie Bucket.  But once again, it is Depp, who normally steals scenes, that is too utterly creepy to allow me to enjoy the movie.  I also found it funny that the original, which focused on Charlie Bucket, is called \\"Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory,\\" and this version, which focuses on Willy Wonka, is called \\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.\\"  If you have kids, you MIGHT want to let them watch it, if only to tell them to stay away from creepy strangers like Michael Jack, er, I mean Willy Wonka.  I hope Hollywood can come out an make a more enjoyable remake in the future.d can come out an make a more enjoyable remake in the future.
0385336691|3.0|Firstly let me say that I am a massive Lee Child fan and I have read every book and I eagerly anticipate seeing who will play Jack Reacher when the books get made into films !!! <br />However I think this latest offering was written to a deadline or perhaps Lee Child just got bored along the way!! <br />I have waited for the new title since I read about it on the Lee Child web site and ordered it from the US just because I could not wait the extra 3mths before Uk release, To my horror I found what was to be a brilliant plot line very thin indeed and the ending a major let down, where has the Reacher of Killing Floor, Persuader and The Enemy gone too ??? <br />I would hate Jack Reacher to turn into a \\"Pulp\\" charactor and should retain some depth and mystery !! If Lee Child has to rest him a bit then fine I can wait, just do not deliver him in mediocre plots !!
B000062X9B|5.0|How many artists do you know who can cover as many songs as Johnny Cash (from genres of pop, country, blues, rock, hard rock, and metal - sorry, no rap!), and still make each song his own?  His interpretations of the songs shed a new light on what the original writer may have meant, but that is the magic and sheer brilliance of Cash.  From Tom Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down\\" to \\"Wayfaring Stranger,\\" there is enough meat in between to satisfy all types of listeners.  I love \\"I Won't Back Down\\" and his cover of U2's \\"One.\\"  Not many people would be able to take on a U2 song successfully without trying to imitate Bono, but Cash sings the song with the passion that makes Cash one of the most iconic figures in music (as well as makes Bono a huge fan).  I also enjoyed \\"That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day),\\" which sounds so hauntingly beautiful and which such sparse instrumentation that Cash's lingering voice settles into your skin long after the song is over.  Some songs might be hit-or-miss, but it is the \\"hits\\" that makes this album more than the worth the money.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I have been a fan of AFI for years. Ever since 'Answer that and stay fashionable.' It's great to hear how much they've come along and matured over the years. I must say, after reading a few of the negative reviews I was a little iffy about buying it. I don't know what some of these people are talking about. They obviously don't know good music when they hear it. Of coarse they're not gonna keep the same sound. Change is sometimes good, and in AFI's case, it's great. I love their sound and especially Davey's vocals. This album is great from start to finish.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|This is a return to form somewhat. I have enjoyed all their CD's but this one has a little more passion and a few more hooks then their last few. They will go down in history as this generations greatest band. The great thing is I have heard most of these songs live and they are just amazing. I am glad people have started to return to true rock music such as PJ and RHCP.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|Unlike The English Patient, which was AMAZING, The Constant Gardener was a quite a disappointment. <br />The film sheds light (as it should do) on the reality of major pharmaceutical companies' dirty dealings in the third world with the support of various governments. More importantly it does a good job of showing who is, more often than not, behind the various plots, schemes, and wars, not to mention how corrupt the world has become, and how tragic conditions really are in most of Africa. <br />Ralph Fiennes' performance was surprisingly (!) average, while the rest of the cast seem totally out of place. <br />As for the characters, they are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.   <br />Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given.  In addition, Bill Nighy who was wonderful in Love Actually and the Underworld trilogy has his talent go to waste in this film. <br />Other setbacks are in relation to:  <br />1) Ralph Fiennes' character was a major pushover bordering on ludicrous. <br />2) Rachel Weisz who does not seem to belong in this movie.   <br />3) Rachel Weisz' character who overdoes it in all respects, becoming VERY annoying, very early on!  Give me a break! <br />4) The weak first half of the movie as opposed to the rest of the film. <br />5) The writers/director lacking the ability to... write and direct. <br />In short, the acting is average, the setting is good, the plot is interesting (could have been amazing!), while the dialogues are below average. <br />Though the potential for a good movie was there it fails to take off.   <br />A shame really...  No masterpiece here. <br />
B00005JOQS|3.0|All in all, a decent film. <br />Good special effects, but not exceptional. <br />Generally good acting. <br />Good story-line. <br />A little slow at times. <br /> <br />NOthing super, but moderately satifying.
B00005JL2O|4.0|Austin Powers in GOLDMEMBER<br /><br />Not a bad movie at all. Pretty funny, but not as funny as Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me.<br /><br />Should've given more dialog to Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child); instead, she's just the next girlfriend for Austin, and not a more fleshed-out character, like Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley before her.<br /><br />The character of Goldmember, while not in the film a lot, could've been cut down a bit more. He isn't particlularly interesting. He's not as evil as Dr. Evil, and not as disgusting as Fat [...], and comes off as a washed out amalgam of the two.<br /><br />Fred Savage, from TV's \\"The Wonder Years,\\" is good in his two scenes as \\"the Mole.\\"  It's Dr. Evil, as usual, who steals the show, however.

Avoid this soundtrack at all costs!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I hate to admit this, because I have been saying how there is nothing good on television for a while, but this show has got me hooked!  I love the mix of the ethical questions they raise and how they bring humanity to each person's decisions.  I am amazed how they blast you with something shocking and then let you breathe with laughter the next minute.  The show has the best writers out there as they weave their magic spell.  It is almost too much to handle in an hour.   <br /> <br />Also Burke, McDreamy and Alex are equally easy on the eyes (and great actors).  And Izzie just makes the show fun to watch.  At first I thought she was just a barbie, but then she proved that she's an amazing actress with both comedy and drama.  Christina is great with her dry, hard shell.  It really is an all-star cast.  I love how their personalities counter-balance each other perfectly.
B00006JDVV|2.0|As Bart Simpson would say, this movie both Sucks and Blows ! While the dragon effects are cool, nothing else is in this movie, which should've been titled \\"SuckFest 2020.\\"<br /><br />The concept is interesting, but the \\"plot\\" is hackneyed, the acting bad, and it just gets worse from there. They couldn't even be honest in the commercials. Matthew McConaughey is not the star of this movie, it's Christian Bale (two roles of which were as a psycho killer in the universally panned American Psycho, and as a JFK Jr. clone in the fairly awful re-make of Shaft. THAT's star power, baby! The new Batman will be trying to live down this fiasco as well).<br /><br />Particularly good is the unending use of every tired cliche in the movie book. Post-Apocalyptic world? Let's make it look like Mad Max/the Road Warrior, and give everyone an Australian/British accent. Who comes to save the day? Americans, of course. Let's make sure the two heroes neither like nor trust each other... until they have to team up to defeat the bad guy at the end, of course. Add one attractive female for a love-interest. And the teenage boy who won't listen to Dad, and wants to fight himself. Or the tough-as-nails, always screaming, army sergeant, chewing the stub of a cigar.<br /><br />And there are just too many inconsistencies, even for a fantasy \\"dragon\\" movie. For people who are starving to death and are, as they say \\"leading lives of quiet desperation,\\" they sure know how to party when they kill a dragon: with lights and wine and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Fire\\" blasting from the stereo. (For people who watched dragons burn up the whole world, would YOU be blasting \\"Let me stand next to your fire\\" ?) And where IS the stereo in this bombed-out Keep / Castle / Cave they're living in? And where is the electricity, or how do they make it? And with no water source around, where do they get water for drinking and their fire-hose equipped trucks ?<br /><br />And all these \\"starving\\" people have quite a bit of muscle-tone, don't they?<br /><br />Where do the Americans get the fuel to run their helicopter and tanks, and whatever troop carrier they used to get from the U.S.A. to London, England?<br /><br />It's movies like this that made TV popular in the first place.<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * *<br /><br />Rating: Duscle-tone, don't they? <br /> <br />Where do the Americans get the fuel to run their helicopter and tanks, and whatever troop carrier they used to get from the U.S.A. to London, England? <br /> <br />It's movies like this that made TV popular in the first place. <br /> <br />* * * * * * * * * * <br /> <br />Rating: D

B00005JP0A|5.0|This is an excellent little satire on getting ahead in business and how we sometimes have to sell our souls in the process.    Or, rather, how we *choose* to sell our souls in the process.    The Devil Wears Prada is about a fresh out of college, would-be journalist (Hathaway) who gets her first job as an assistant for a high-powered fashionista (Streep). She soon learns that nothing about her job is fair or even palatable, but that she's going to have to adapt to it in order to accomplish her dreams of being a serious journalist. However, she eventually has to confront the question \\"is it worth it?\\" as she realizes that the job changes her in the process, and puts her at odds with the people she'd once loved and was loved by.    This is an excellent question, and this film is an excellent examination of that question.    People who've never been in the kind of work environment shown here might not find as much humor in it as I did. What makes it all so funny/painful is how true it all is. I trust that the author of the novel upon which this movie was based must have had a strong real-life experience in a similar situation. While perhaps exaggerated, it's really real.    This is a great film and a good time, and brings up many things worth thinking and talking about. Finally, this review would be remiss if I didn't bring up the incredible display of beauty, here. Anne Hathaway is breathtaking, and she will be one of the great sex symbols of the next several years to come.    Well worth watching.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I think there's about an eyelash of a difference in the love I have for this SAN QUENTIN CD and my FOLSOM CD .... they are both AWESOME!!!!    If I had to choose just one, it would be difficult -- extremely difficult -- but, I would go with San Quentin... I think... well... maybe....
B00007KWHP|5.0|Hi my people. I am back once again to expound yet another wise and ethereal musical choice worth further investigation. You all will be happy to know that I acquired a smart looking red.white, and blue Seers cap for this holiday season. It was given to me by Chance (my neo-maven guide whom you haven't met yet). So, indeed, I am taking a chance wearing it in the hopes that it will help me make crisp observations about this selection.<br /><br />First off, Fragile is the ultimate high-water mark in the world of progressive rock. How did this come to be? Well certainly Yes, before this, was quite a talented and creative band. But this album represented a quantitative leap from their previous effort and remains a true classic in every sense of the word. But why should this be so? Certainly Rick Wakeman, the advant garde prodigy of keyboard, had alot to do with it. With his effort this band was given polish, nuance and the freedom to explore different uncharted waters of popular music. Like the wooden plane on the cover, the discovery and searching for more aspects of the world (and music) became an over indulgent pleasure. But his competence gave all the other band members the ability to raise their own level of play, and in this selection we have the greatest example of creative interplay ever recorded.  Sound like I'm awed? You better believe I am.<br /><br />There are many musical themes here.  And themes within themes. Repeated, then lost, then reappearing, sometimes changed and then sometimes not.  It is up to the astute listener to really hear how all the individual parts equal the totality of the sound. But this, good friends, is what Seers talk about in their mystical chatrooms. Don't tell Chance I told you. Although spiritual, he can be very vindictive.<br /><br />Each artist on this recording provides thematic glue to bind everything together. Not that they are all on the same page every moment. But the individual forays into what their own instrument can accomplish somehow, magically, all falls into place. It is a puzzle which produces amazing results.<br /><br />We begin with \\"Roundabout\\" which I equate with a dimensional shift in perspective.  Listening closely you can hear how Wakeman introduces the song seguing into Steve Howe's excellent intro. The song moves from that soft passage to driving beat with all contributing equal parts of flair and snippets of incredible nuance to the whole. It then slows down to Jon's soft vocal and then rises dramatically back to the rythmn's driving force. Pay attention to this motif, because Yes uses this plan many times throughout. Just like the cover, Yes's music can travel high to the sky and then swoop down to the ocean and then rise over mountains.<br /><br />Wakeman then gives us a wonderful classical break with \\"Cans and Brahms\\". This selection reveals his mastery of moog and keyboard and, interestingly enough, provides us with a glimpse of the genuine class you can find in this genre.<br /><br />We then have the jaunty \\"We Have Heaven\\" whereby Jon Anderson's vocals really have a field day singing lyrics that, although each has it's own melodic structure, somehow blend together. This key also extends to the music. How each distinct unrelated pattern can blend to make up the whole.<br /><br />\\"South Side of the Sky\\", after the swirling wind intro, provides you with some very fine juxtaposed complimentary riffs from Steve Howe and Chris Squire. And have I yet mentioned Squire to you? What he does with bass guitar in this album is make it a formidable force and a distinct, essential instrument in it's own right. It provides bottom for sure, but then extends into it's own spatial realm and becomes a force equal to the other instruments. The music changes path during midway and after Wakeman provides a dramatic stop with the piano, he is then off offering a new a delicate piano theme. Although about being trapped in a snowstorm, this song coveys amazing range.<br /><br />\\"Five PerCent For Nothing\\" is quite a quizzical short musical piece. Jumpy and erratic - they all throw snippets of musical excursion into the mix and somehow, somehow it all comes together! It boggles the mind!<br /><br />\\"Long Distance Runaround\\" is sheer pleasure. Listen for Squire's dancing bass pattern and listen how Wakeman transposes the main riff with an alternate version in the song. Bruford's drumming on this becomes adventurous and essential. A lyric they include here is \\"Hot colour, melting the anger to stone\\". How can this be? Does it make sense? How can anything melt and become stone? Maybe lava perhaps. But, in Yes language, this is such a great line.<br /><br />We then have Squire's interesting and quavering bass on \\"The Fish\\" and then, another beautiful classical snippet from Wakeman called \\"Mood For a Day\\". The thread that links all these selections together, although being magical, are also fragile indeed.<br /><br />We then come to the gem of the album. Yes, \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" incorporates and extends all the qualities I've talked about so far. Listen to that beginning. That fast, dual driven riff by Howe and Squire(with fills by Wakeman) are to die for. You then get to the Squire solo starting off with just the most incredible drum fills by Bruford. After this barrage of sound enter Howe again with that wonderful, soft see-saw intro into Jon's vocals. It is beautiful, lilting and an emotional texture and homage to lost love. It swerves, moves upward, into that final awesome crescendo at the end. Everytime I hear this song it just gets better and better.<br /><br />On the remastered version we have a version of \\"America\\" and an early mix of \\"Roundabout\\". Interesting and excellent as they are, they really offer no further insight into the main body of work.<br /><br />People. This album is such great stuff. My enthusiasm never dims. It is a lush, generous recording and, amazing enough, with each listen you will discover more worlds as Fragile did when it was recorded.  The wonder of this album is that you can hear it differently each time you hear it? How? Well, one time I can listen to Squire's bassline. The next, Howe's contribution. And so forth accordingly. Then, to get really creative you could listen to Howe and Squire or Wakeman and Bruford or Jon and Wakeman or Bruford and Squire. Pick out your own permutations. They are all equal value to the sum of the parts and this is what drives Fragile into the exceptional range.<br /><br />Well People. That's it. Got to look for Chance now and get to that Independence Day party. I am wearing that hat and sunglasses as a disguise. I hope my flowing robe and long white beard don't give me away. Do you think it will?<br /><br />Ah well. To all --a wonderful and exciting holiday. Let us all celebrate the freedom of our minds as well. Blessings - your Metamorphol short musical piece.

B00003CXWV|5.0|Well, I have to say first, I was sad to hear that the director of this movie had passed.  I don't know the exact circumstances of his demise, but suffice it to say, he'll be missed.<br /><br />This is one of only 10-15 movies I've seen in the theater over the last 5 years.  I pretty much stopped going to the movie theater, and enjoy saving lots of money, while still getting complete enjoyment from DVD viewing on my wide screen HD television.<br /><br />However, I'm very glad that I chose to see this one in the theater.  It was definitely worth the effort.<br /><br />Re-watching this movie multiple times, and enjoying the DVD extras really is quite a treat.  I like DVD's that include lots of extras, and this movie certainly is one of them.  And if you're wondering why my title centers on the Director, it is from viewing the extras.  You really can tell what a caring person he is, watching him interact with the cast and crew, and especially the actual person the movie is about.<br /><br />You get to experience what a crazed and varied life Jung lived through the eyes of the director in the movie, and than again, from his words and video on the bonus features.<br /><br />Great movie!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!
1592400876|4.0|A neighbor of mine highly recommended this book to me.  I am not sure of her background, but she knew I had a background in grammar, so she thought I would like it.  However, I had since spoken with two friends of mine who are both smarter than I (and don't have a background in grammar).  Both told me that they didn't like the book as they found it insulting. <br /> <br />In both cases, they read the book to learn more about punctuation but felt that the author was insulting them for not being as good at punctuation as she.  In reading the book, I can see where this comes from, but that is not the author's purpose.  The author is showing us proper punctuation, but she is also trying to get us to set our collective foot down.  I see what she means.  At the courtroom in a nearby town, a door in the back states \\"Employee's Only.\\"  I don't exactly know what they mean by that, but the sight of the unneeded apostrophe bothers me.  What are we coming to? <br /> <br />Although there is much to learn here about punctuation, the book is intended more for a reminder rather than a primer.  If any reader has trouble with the comma and its ilk, then this is probably not the best book.  For both the skilled and unskilled, take a close look at the book.  As it was originally written in England, it may very well be geared towards British English.  There are differences in the punctuation used on both sides of the ocean, so be wary.
6305252572|5.0|This is absolutely Eddie Murphy's best movie!  Certainly better than most other stuff he's done this century, and the past decade!  I saw this movie for the first time in the theater, and also have it on VHS.  I have watched this movie easily 50 times.  I'm sure it might be more though.<br /><br />It is a true classic, highlighting the true natural talent of Eddie Murphy.  He and Nick Nolte play off each other well, and Nolte isn't too bad himself in the comedy department.  Though his type of humor is much more subtle.  He does get his digs in, on Mr. Murphy's expense, mind you.<br /><br />To the best of my knowledge, this was one of the first movies that combined excellent humor scenes with extreme violence and emotion.  And while many tried to duplicate it, in later years, including other Eddie Murphy vehicles, such as Beverly Hills Cop, nothing can compare to the original!<br /><br />A true classic. I will probably buy this on DVD soon, but I'm kind of holding out for an \\"extras loaded\\" special DVD, if it were to come out!  Don't know that for a fact, but I'm still holding out hope!<br /><br />Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!
B00005JOWF|4.0|There are many reasons why I liked Ultraviolet but first and foremost I liked it for the intense, graphic and innovative fight sequences that splattered my screen from the second I pressed play. In books I expect the story to stir up the images but in movies it's the visuals that rock my world, and the story follows closely behind.     This movie surely had my eyes  and my mind captivated from start to finish. The story as far fetched as it was didn't throw me off, as I followed Violet, played by Milla Jovovich who in my mind was born to play quirky high combat characters, and her team of friends and foes as the so called, Blood Wars fed life cycles of modern Earth. She  is on a  mission which  I will not give away, but  that  mission makes her angry,   unstoppable and out for blood as she flew, drove , kicked, shot, sliced though and propelled herself again st laws of gravity towards her goal. The colors, liquid metallics, flying  scraps of matter,  bullets, heart stopping stunts and  her motorbike skills left me with my  mouth open and my brain entertained in a way that  is hard for most movies.  I have never seen the Ultraviolet comics but this movie was swimming in special effects so collaborative that all fantastic movies now have more to struggle against as this set new standards .      I know I  might have more unusual liking for movies than the majority, and as many people didn't seem to like it, I have to  say that this was wonderful and intense  beyond what I expected. The music by Klaus  Badelt was just as magnificent  and will have to go on top of my movie scores list. Great movie,  as long as seen with an open mind and total openness for some fantastic butt kicking as it blends  Kill Bill, The Matrix,  Aliens and  all my favorite super heroes into one.
078324228X|3.0|This is an entertaining movie, albeit historically inaccurate at times.  For example, there is a scene in the movie where Carter is \\"robbed\\" by a decision where he lost to Joey Giardello, the middleweight champion.  This was a real cheap shot at Giardello, who won the fight on all three cards, in Philadelphia. Like most big punchers, Carter tired in the later rounds, with the champion hurting him with left hooks in the last three rounds.                                                          <br />As boxing historian Jack Newfield pointed out, the only person who believes Carter won that fight is Norman Jewison, the movie's producer. In today's world, the most prominent historians are filmmakers; it would be helpful if they tried to be more accurate.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|I became a fan of the Peppers when their first album was released.  Having grown up in LA, Ive probably been to 30 of their shows.  They were different and fresh and their distinctive sound was driven by Flea's driving bass and Anthony's sing song rapping.   <br /> <br />Well excepting a handful of songs on the two album disk, thats not who they are any more.  Anthony is just a singer (and not an especially talented one) and Flea's bass is largely just another instrument in a solid but unexciting quartet.    They are a solid rock group that stil has some of their original influences, but I have hundrds of CD's, I dont listen to them to hear a solid rock group.  I listen to them to get up and jump.   <br /> <br />Flea, recently told a reporter that \\"If you don't like this album, you don't like the Peppers\\".  Alas he may be right.  I wont buy the next one.
0931838401|5.0|There is no better source of information about older cameras. With hundreds (thousands?) of photos and excellent descriptions, if you collect, buy or are just interested in cameras you can't go wrong.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The bootleg version of this has been out and circulating for years.  Thats how people can rate it before it's release. <br /> <br />I have seen the DVD from beginning to end and it's an excellent concert.  The sound on the bootleg was pretty good, should be better on the official release. <br /> <br />Can't wait to own the official version.
B00003CX8U|5.0|The origional modern musical.  Even by todays standards ... a cutting edge piece of work.  I enjoyed it years ago ... and enjoy it just as much today ... fun and quirky. <br /> <br />
B000EHSVQE|1.0|Like many others, I heard that this was a good movie.  I missed out on it in theaters, but saw it on a field trip bus with my dad.  After being seated in seperate sections, our consensus when we stepped off of the bus was, \\"that was funny?\\"  My parents have raised me on Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Airplane!, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, and Zorro the Gay Blade.  That is our sense of humor, and Napoleon Dynamite just didn't appeal to us.  I cringe when I see \\"Vote for Pedro\\" shirts and special editions of this cult DVD.  I form instant prejudices against anyone who claims to have enjoyed it, so heavily does sense of humor factor into my opinions of people.  I know this seems wrong, but oh well.  To those of you who didn't enjoy it, thank goodness there's some sainity left in the world.  To those who did, I consider you lost souls.
B0000542D2|4.0|In many ways, I don' t think to sound exaggerate to affirm it. A day in the lives of these emblematic integrants of the most famous Band in the history, perhaps under the perspective of more than  forty years elapsed, it may be seen as a naïf picture if you want, but you should turn back the needles of the watch and to set in the right moment; perhaps the most important aspect to remark is that it allowed to establish the first possibility of expression backstage, that eventually would open the gates for future documents of enormous historical transcendence.

0553293397|4.0|Elijah Baley solves another case with his logical yet unreasonable partner, R Daneel Olivaw. This time it is not within the steel caves of New York City, but in the open plains of the sparsely populated Solaria. A world that has reached the epitome of technological paradise.<br /><br />Though, the book is not necessarily well written as a detective piece. The murderer is somewhat obvious, and the investigation can at times be dull. What is interesting is this new world Asimov created. A world so wrapped up with the companionship of their advanced robots, that people shudder at the thought of seeing another person in the flesh. Some people will faint at the sight. Some people will stay a good twenty feet away from a man. Some people will do worse. They are enslaved to the robots for their livelihood, their protection, and they are even mothered by the robots after birth.<br /><br />It turns out that Earth is exactly the same in many ways. But instead of being isolated from individuals, Earth is isolated by other cities, other planets, other ventures. Baley can barely last five minutes in the Solarian sun without fainting himself. Whereas Solaria's wealthy estates ran only by robots cause people to fear anyone one person, Earth's primitively walled in cities cause people to fear manifest destiny.<br /><br />PS: There was a certian individual who claimed that the nudity exhibited in this novel should have been cesnored.  I am in complete disagreement in the first case because I do not believe in censorship.  Despite this, I do not believe that there is anything in this book to censor.  The only line that makes desciption of the female form is as followed, \\"Gladia looked down at her nudity in surprise and said, 'Well of course'\\" (61).  Not a single word is used to illustrate a nude body other than the word \\"nudity\\" itself.  Everything is left to the imagination and is very tasteful.  I would say the taboo of nudity in this novel, though it is not portrayed in explicit detail, is what makes this book intriguing as oppose to revolting.icit detail, is what makes this book intriguing as oppose to revolting.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|For the all Dream Theater Fans, here is the token that the all band had reunited in order for us to enjoy. This DVD contains the whole concert they played on the Radio City Music Hall (NY) April 1st 2006. This was the final show of the Octavarium 20th Anniversary World Tour, and it a real special Dream Theater show since they played, not all of the show, 90 min, with an Orchestra. According to Mike Portnoy he said: \\"I truly believe last night (April 1st) was the PINNACLE of our 20 year career, thus far and an incredible ending to the latest chapter in DT history.\\" This DVD also includes a 1 hour Documentary tracking the entire career of the band from the very beginnings at the Berklee College Of Music in 1985 all the way to the Radio City Music Hall grand finale. Including rare never before seen footage and interviews with current and previous members of the band. So for you all fans and non-fans this DVD promises to be a great master piece earned to be collected by you all. I know that we are still one month away to be finally released, but still you deserved to know what's up with this DVD and why it is so special.  <br />Long Live DT!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|First off I have quite a background on silent hill since I have played all but one of the American games released. So I have what you can say a better understanding of what to expect than I person whose going to see Silent Hill because of an captivating trailer or a friends opinion.  Now, in every Silent Hill you play as a character that is drawn to the town of Silent Hill through a plot. In this case you look through the eyes of Rose Da Silva searching for an answer for her child's illness. So the movie plays out as Rose searching for Silent Hill and is determined to go there to hopefully find some answers. When she arrives there she meets characters, solves simple puzzles of leading one clue onto the next until finally finding her daughter. Of course along the way she gets to meet a bunch of memorable badies from throughout the entire Silent Hill series of video games.  Now it's quite easy to simply throw a video game into a movie blender and puree on low for 127 minutes. But what comes out can be quite disappointing, which is a pretty high reputation for video game to movie conversions.  Instead Silent Hill is seemingly integrated from its origins and is plotted out step by step literally immersing you into a silent hill game on autopilot. You get the action, puzzles, creepiness, the mysteriousness, the music, the atmosphere, the immersion; you get Silent Hill THE MOVIE. (Intense!) . However this takes me to a review I read previously and enlightens me how carelessly someone has overlooked the movie with shallow expectations. This goes back to that person mentioning that Christopher DaSilva as a character deemed pretty incoherent or pointless. Sure at first glance he is quickly recorded bickering throughout the movie with the cop here and there. But If you take a closer look at his role, he is actually the entity that the visually shows you the separation between Silent Hill and the \\"Real world.\\" Just a small example to look at the whole picture.  So whether or not you're still deciding to watch Silent Hill, I think it's worth the experience, and although you may or may not like it, this movie will ultimately give you the definition of what Silent Hill really is!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|My wife and I enjoy this CD very much!  Well done.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|First time you hear Corinne Bailey Rae, you're thinking--who's that?  Well, Billie Holliday's out of the question, but Madeline Peyroux isn't and there's a touch of Norah Jones in there, too.   <br /> <br />\\"Put your records on\\" was the song that caught my attention first. Love the backbeat and jazz.  The whole CD's well worth listening to.  Like another reviewer said, good for a slow Saturday afternoon.
