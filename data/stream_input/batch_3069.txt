B006ZAZ31U|5.0|many books I have read in military genre  stories and deeds of men in uniform across globe ,they all stand United ,this book is indeed special in th  lot close to heart to be read by anyone who calls for war on drop of a dime
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|super awesome show, its an hour long which is a bit much for a tv show but I still think its worth the time
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This is a great woman's story.  Since I was born in East<br />Tennessee, I particularly related to the setting and the<br />culture of the Appalachians.  The science included made<br />it much more interesting, a la Barbara Kingsolver.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I Love this show was hooked from the very first episode. This is a very well produced show.  I also love the period costumes.
B0026Q8EWW|2.0|This movie seemed to have potential. Decent actors, decent story line. Etc. However, it misses the mark. It ends up being slow and boring.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I clicked on this app out of curosity and am glad that I did. I enjoy playing it when I have some free time or just want a quick chuckle. I especially love the video!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dr. Sleep is a good book that follows King's mastery of quality horror writing.  Although the main character &#34;Danny&#34; is the boy from The Shining this story stands on it's own a unique novel.  If you are an avid King reader you will notice he draws a bit from plots from previous novels.  I noticed elements of &#34;Fire Starter&#34;,  &#34;Thinner&#34;, and &#34;Dead Zone&#34; in the development of characters.  Overall a good Stephen King read!
B004YXE438|3.0|And that is why I downloaded this game.  It is fun, and a good way to spend a little extra time.  My only complaint is the limited quantity of pictures, and the boring nature of the ones that are there.  Otherwise, a good way to while away a little spare time.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Ok... I loved comic books as a kid; here they are come to life.  Attractive people, comic book storyline, cool special effects.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I downloaded this app not knowing if I would like it. I love it for some reason it doesn't bore me at all!! Get it, it's cute and fun.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Great behind the scenes of what probably really goes on in Washington! Great acting, stories and style! Cannot wait for season 2!!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I've had a lot of car chargers over the years - as I am sure many of us have in the digital age.  They are always a varying level of quality or features.  Some times even the OEM charges are not designed or built well.  Fuses blow, cords permanently stretch, ends get gunked up with things from the car, etc...<br /><br />For the first time I can say that this is a truly great car charger.  It simply does exactly what it is supposed to do, does it quickly and then also seems to be built like a tank.  The coils have just the right amount of tension and the connector fits snugly.  And then, there's the light.  Unlike many chargers with a little LED, this features a white light ring that comes on when the charger is plugged in.  It sheds just the right amount of light in the car to help you see things at night, without being distracting - although I am sure that depends on where your socket is located.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a car charger, this one rocks!
0099519852|5.0|I only wish I had read this book when I was younger, it has changed the way I look at people and processes. It speaks to every level of how real talent is developed - And if you approach what every you do with excitement ( ignition) and commit to deep practice and find a coach to mentor you - what every you peruse will be enhanced a 100 fold - great book.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|The one that started it all.  This is a great movie on so many levels.  I am not a professional reviewer, so I will just say that my wife really hates science fiction movies, but she loved this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad I can finally play on my kindle device.  Really love the game it is Fun and addictive.
B004P68T30|5.0|I'll bring my Kindle to Dr apts or other such things, and this will keep my kids busy for a while at least. =)
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I'm still trying to get through this book.  It is a slow go for me.  Story not bad but to many thought details which makes it drag.  If you don't mind taking your time to read it, this may be a book for you.
159448385X|5.0|Hard to believe it, but it's better than Kite Runner!  What an amazing story from start to finish.  For the first half you think you are reading two different stories simultaneously.  Surprise ending, but well thought out, well developed.  The author takes his time to let the reader enjoy the ending.  Leaves you wanting the story to continue.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great entertainment.  Not flashy, low key and the characters are well cast.  Story lines are interesting, believable and always intriguing.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I wondered if antivirus apps actually did any good on android devices and apparently the answer is YES.  AVG Antivirus has found a couple of questionable behaviors that I was unaware of and I was able to remove them before they became problems.  With the free price it seems you can't go wrong,
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have read the first two books in the series and was looking forward to the final book. I was very disappointed in this book. It was boring! It had none of the excitement of the first two books. The worst part was the ending...it left you empty.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome show very addictive. Do yourself a favor if you like episode one go ahead and buy the season you will save at least five dollars!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love this show! I get wrapped up in it and can't turn it off!I was so excited to see that you had season 3.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Sons of Anarchy was not another 'bad biker' drama.  It had captivating sequences which held your interest to the end.  The violence and sex was marvelously filmed and was not over bearing.  The acting was excellent, except for an occasional mis-cast actor.  This is definetly for mature audences - not for childern.  Good story.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very good game for a freebie would definitely recommend downloading this game is it if am go to the last call
B0051UT7Q2|5.0|Wow, just couldn't put the book down. A great read that brought history to life interwoven with a story of love and intrigue.
B00E0SX118|5.0|As an adult, I have watched this movie over and over. My boys, three and five, love it as well. You will want to purchase this one!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the chapters being narrated by Tris and Tobias. The big step they made toward keeping their relationship intact was their promise not to lie to each other anymore. Tobias really comes across as a character in love with Tris and she makes him feel more secure and a better person, even though they argue and agree to disagree as well. Tris is still more obstinate and very sure of herself- her way of thinking and reactions are so much different than Tobias'.<br />I loved how they showed much more affection for each other and kiss in front of their friends and they are definitely ribbed about it (but they don't care). There are many upheavals with the factions (more history about before the factions), continued drama with Tobias' parents, and Tris' brother, Caleb. I liked the Old Chicago and New Chicago and the aspects of the truth serum and the ambiguity they feel about using them. I never expected the surprise end, but you will have to read the book. I love Roth as a writer and these 3 books were some of my favorite dystopian novels.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Loved the creepiness and the acting was fantastic.  Highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the real mixed in with the fantasy.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I am a fan of Rainbow Rowell- her characters, her plot, her dialog and all the dysfunction in families, with friends, etc. I LOVED Eleanor and Park and I Loved Fangirl!!! They both have an insecure main character in Eleanor and Cather. They both have an adorable male protagonist in Park and Levi. But Rowell has crafted a totally different story and gratifyingly absorbed me the whole time I read this engaging, humorous, and ultimately GREAT, GREAT, GREAT story of growing pains, tremendous insecurities, and fearsome love (for family and friends and boyfriends). Cather is a freshman in college and her twin, Wren (who has been her staunchest ally up to freshman year)is not her roommate and out partying hard and drinking and not returning Cath's calls. Cath has a scary roommate, Reagan (I loved her- she totally grows on you)and with Reagan comes her boyfriend, Levi. Cath has so many hangups and they are even more pronounced since Wren has ditched her and Cath isolates herself in her room, writes fan fiction about Simon and Baz (and has a huge readership). Rowell reveals all of Cath's insecurities in her dealings (or not) with her roommate and Levi, not eating in the cafeteria, and not going to parties. But the reader likes and roots for Cath- that she will throw off the blanket of fears and anxieties she has cocooned herself in and participate in life, college, and love. I love how characters don't give up on Cather, how Levi and her Professor work with Cath at her halting pace and how, in Cath's own crippling way- she achingly blooms. Please read this book; it is great writing, dialog, and characters trough and through. If you have not read her other book, Eleanor and Park - then read that after- I promise, you will not be disappointed. Her books and characters ring true (she gets family dysfunction, teens, and best of all romance)
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|What can I say, this movie is just plain FANTASTIC!  The acting is awesome all around.  Watched it twice and will watch it again.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this to not only be informative but also inspiring.  Despite the fact that Tesla allowed himself to be swindled out of his frightful fortune he still goes down as a giant amongst ants.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|It's not bad, but it gets very difficult quickly. But it's still really fun to play. A good pastime .
B006Z00R1Q|2.0|I only watched because my wife made me.. And I'm only writing this because it requires more words? Oi, still nor enough.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was the most beautiful book I have ever read I finished very fast because I was so hooked and when the book ended I was so sad but perk of being a wallflower is the best book I have ever read and my favorite
1600597963|4.0|Jamie Cloud Eakin has done it again!! I fallen in love with yet another of her Bead Embroidery books, and rekindled my love of creating jewellery and works of art with Bead Embroidery. Thankyou Jamie for producing such gorgeous books ox
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good app works well does everything it should.  Wish I could play music for my alarm but it is still awesome. Happy with this!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was one of the better pieces of fiction I'd read in a long time. Excellent dialogue and very suspenseful,
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After receiving my Chromecast, I was able to set it up in no time.  5 minutes after unwrapping the package,  I was broadcasting YouTube videos to my TV with ease.  Although the Google platforms and Netflix are the primary broadcasters (AT THIS TIME), everything and more can be found on YouTube, so that doesn't bother me.  As far as the price is concerned, you just can't beat it!  I watch videos from other sites through my Chrome browser and broadcast with ease to my TV as well.  If you're on the fence, I would highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Since the climactic ending of the book was revealed to me, I almost didn’t even bother to read it.  If part of the book is revealed in someone’s review (especially if there is a spoiler alert), it is my own fault for reading it but when it is revealed in a quote usually there to advertise the book, it is giving way too much away.  However, since I knew the end I was able to anticipate it and therefore see it from a different perspective.  Although it wasn’t my ideal ending sometimes the ending should'nt be perfect.<br /><br />But aside from the ending, the story line just wasn't the same quality as the first two books of the series.  There were too many holes in the story or details left unexplained.<br /><br />I did like the narrative coming from both Tris and Tobias.  And I loved the continued development of their relationship.<br />I just expected so much more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. Very addictive. It has stopped working 3 different times but I have deleted and downloaded each time to start over. As I said, it's addictive.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good beach reading. Kept me guessing. Really enjoyed the developed characters in the story. Made you really think what one  suburban family would do with this kind of secret?
B003G4W49C|5.0|I liked that you got to know the characters, new ones added slowly, story held my interest, and there was a twist at the end that I did not see coming.  The only bad thing was that the twist at the very end is not continued in the next book in the series, don't bother with it.  Maybe try one of the 5 or 6 books that Card had written since to fill in the space between these first two books.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|If you like Rafa, and if you'd like to get to know him more this book is for you. Interesting reading about tennis player and person, his family, behind the scenes from some grand slam finals, and what was going through Rafa's mind in these matches.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|A second book from the Founders of 37Signals ( Rework) which outlines how they have made working remotely really work. Lots of examples form their experience and those of other large and small companies, put the lie to the Yahoo story about working remotely. Some great lines.  You shouldn't hire people you can not trust nor should you work where you are not trusted.<br /><br />Good suggestions on easy screen casting, meetups and conferencing tools.  Plus years of experience in assisting their wide ly place \\"stars\\" in dealing with what can come up. I appreciate that time slots should overlap by four hours to make for smooth hand offs.Equal pay across geographies is a great concept.  And in hiring paying extreme attention to the writing's in  the cover letter since  to be good at remote work you must be able to write.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I saw the blurb in People's Magazine for this book and was intrigued...did not disappoint and will suggest for my book club!  I was so captivated;I couldn't put the book down.
B00B2QA646|5.0|I thought this movie was absolutely wonderful. Brilliantly acted, true to the book, creatively artsy. It was a pleasure to see Jude Law in a role that doesn't play on his looks, I was really impressed by his performance. I always like Kiera Knightly and I thought she did a fabulous job portraying Anna's decline. The young man who played Vronksy was very compelling, I'd go out of my way to watch him in other movies. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As the books go one the plot thickens, the twists get more severe, and the books get better. Can't wait to get the next one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am an avid John Grisham reader and this writing would fall toward the bottom of my list. That said it is a Grisham story and the telling (along with a few good plot twists) made it a good read. It is a \\"I been done wrong but made it right\\" tale that will probably be made into a screen play.
0761172726|5.0|I've used the Mom's Calendar for the last 8 years and will continue to use it as long as it's produced.  The spaces for Mom are preprinted and you can add 4 other family members.  Love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Really nicely written, good story. This book drew me in and I had a hard time putting it down. I enjoyed it much more than the kite runner.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My 5 year old loves this game!  I enjoy watching her play...but it constantly crashes my Kindle.  The last crash put my Kindle in to a coma and I can't do anything with the unit!  I can't turn it off, I can't turn it on, it's just stuck in a black hole.  Save yourself the trouble and don't purchase this app!
038533348X|5.0|I was just out of the army the first time I read it. I had lost my sense of humor and was on the verge of becoming a Republican at 21. Vonnegut helped me rediscover laughter in the strangest ways. You really shouldn't laugh at death and the end of the world, but this story was just too funny to ignore. Vonnegut must have looked into the darkness of his own soul saw the cosmic joke. He was a mad genius.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|In Outliers, Gladwell gives us an insight on how systems affect individuals. In David & Goliath he now takes the other view and shows us how individuals can make a difference in spite of the system. Is this it? No, once again he does what he knows best: He analyzes systems from a deep and unconventional perspective. As always, he is entertaining, profound and intelligent; he has a gift for tackling complex themes in a graceful manner. If you have read his other books you will enjoy the aging of his ideas, if you haven't you should probably start with Blink or Outliers. In any case, you will end up feeling smarter than before.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved it and found it so interesting.  It is beautifully written and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love the movie. Love when they remake old cartoons into movies. Would love to see more of the same in the future.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! You can't get a step a head of this book no matter how hard you try it definitely keeps you turning the page!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this game for about a year; it lots a fun.  Have played other bingo games I have not found one like this one.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The book was awesome...best SK book in a long time.  I love how it tied back to the shinging!!!  I will definitely read again.
B000GWE44U|5.0|With all of today's &#34;new&#34; horror flicks, nothing beats the older ones. I just finished reading the Shining and the movie tracks the book very well.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|You cannot cast any browser tabs from a tablet and only get audio from tabs cast from a PC. This means the TV I stream at my PC can be watched on the TV.  Chromecast is next to useless.
0811869261|5.0|I love the artwork, and the story is fun. Lots of facts about various countries. My three year old loves looking at the pictures and pointing out all the characters and asking what they are saying. There are stickers, though I am waiting until she's older to give them to her. The pages are made to allow the stickers to be reused, which leads me to believe the book will last a while as the pages are sturdy.<br /><br />The one downer is the US page. It wasn't very interesting. But the other pages are fun.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Just love this movie.  Great action movie, cannot wait to see the new one coming out.  Super effects and fun for the kids.
157421327X|1.0|Useless book. You can find all of this and a whole lot more for free online. Pintrest is more helpful. Complete waste of money. Tiny, thin book what looks to have been printed very cheaply. Should not be more than a couple of bucks.
B000006YXV|5.0|Great cd to listen to while working.  The best!  He's always been one of my favorites and this collection didn't disappoint.
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|kreator, i have been into this german thrash metal band since i was a teen back in the good 'ol 1980's. i started off with coma of souls, which blew me away. every song on this album is great. please keep in mind, for those whom cannot/do not understand german,  milla petroza sings in english but speaks to his fans in his native german, well, this is a german show and live album companion for their phantom antichrist album, which i also own a copy of the deluxe digipak alternate cover-art edition.<br /><br />i very much advise those whom love this band to buy it now, before you lose out! why? this is another band whom never went mainstream, stuck to their principles for good or ill of their success, unlike other american bands i won't mention.<br /><br />overall, kreator still rules!!!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Damn near broke my back trying to moon walk...I'm 67!  What a great disc.  My grand kids look at me with a look I don't often see but they DO dance with me.  As one of my granddaughters said:  &#34;Grandpa, you're a BRAN muffin!&#34;  She's out of the will!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I had read the book and this followed it almost exactly..Leonardo is great in whatever he does...I really loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game...it is fun but addicting...oh well I did say I would never play,  hays, my choice I guess.Most of my FB friends are also addicted.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is wonderful entertainment. The episodes are individually interesting and they leave you wanting to know more of this family. It is really escapist entertainment and don't we all need some of that once in a while.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|The movie is a classic! The music and everything are stunning. Only downside is some streaming versions do not use the same soundtrack.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|a much awaited final book that left me angry and let down :( I admit I am a sucker for a happy ending and that is most definitely not what I got with this.... Great read.... Stupendous disappointment in the conclusion :(
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Best strategy game for the kindle! I hope they can get kingdom rush frontiers. Anyway this game is well worth 1.99$.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game it always changes to make it great fun can't wait until I find more levels. Thanks!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really love this app cuz it gived me any answer of math that I need.So I think you should get this app if you need answers to math :) thank you and please get this app cuz if you do I will make me very happy :)
B005ZB91KY|5.0|This was a great movie in that it epitomizes what the Nazi's were trying to do during the war... It was not overdone as many of the new movies are so it made for better watching.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is exactly what I expected.<br /><br />Its much faster than any other smart TV / wii/ roku/ etc I've used.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|While I love  Meryl  Street I did not like this movie jumping back and forth. And I thought sometimes even boring. I have a lot of Meryl movies  and will keep this one in my stash some one else may like it. But it did not hold my interest.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I am a happy panda. Her writing lights up my life.<br />And I can't even point to an exact reason why. I would want more if it existed already.
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|Great movie. I watch at least once a year or two. The ending never gets old. One of my favorite Jom Carrey movies.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Arrow was a great Series, i think any comic book fan should watch it. Ther is the right amount of action, mystery and suspense. In the first couple episodes there was some not so hot acting but it got better as the show progressed. The characters get stronger and more interesting with every episode and the plot continues  to thicken with every moment.
B004AFFZNI|1.0|I received a normal GoPro housing and not a skeleton housing. Not sure if it was a mistake or misleading text in the description title. Got a refund and bought elsewhere.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|It is exactly what I expected from Cher. It was a GREAT comeback from her early years from the music business.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a big Stephen King fan I was happy to read this.  The fact is tied in with The Shining made for an even better storyline.  I look forward to more books from him
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|This could be her best album. I love the music and so does my daughter. Finally something we can listen to together
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this addictive game.  it is fun and not boring.  I will continue to play it for a long time.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Would give it 5 stars, if it offered a lot of music choices or even adding my own music to it
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Well written--great characters and generally creepy.  The acting and is great and the story unfolds in an interesting manner.  Really recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a fun game I can now play on my Kindle, smart phone, or my computer! Entertaining and  addictive!
B00A287PG2|1.0|Some dude out to make a quick buck by criticizing McKinsey. Tends to point out only the negative, and often uses baseless/fact-less claims.
B00000IQW5|5.0|It's a great love story with great actors including Audrey Hepburn.  It has action, suspense, and of course romance.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Just a great book and story!  I will recommend it to others. Lots of emotional ups and downs. I want to be friends with Auggie!  I think kids should read it!!
B00AY5B9QA|4.0|I liked the many characters, and parallel stories that all tied together in the end.  Great cast of stars.  Happy ending.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Oy, with the poodles already! COFFEE! COFFEE! COFFEE! Luke & Lorelai 4 EVA! I want to stay at the Dragonfly and live in Stars Hollow.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Much more realistic than other versions of Stargate while staying true to the theme that was already defined. I enjoyed the fact that it was more character driven than the others.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|One of the funniest comedies ever made. Will be one of the classics for a long time.  The writing, acting, and chemistry between the cast is great.  I keep thinking that the writers will run out of interesting stuff or it will get old, but it hasn't The sixth season is as funny as the first.  The characters continue to grow and the jokes grow with them.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The characters were described so well that I felt as if I knew them personally.  An old fashioned love story where the good people all win. I do think I have seen or read the plot in another story a long time ago. I knew where the story was going early on in the book.
1400031354|5.0|I love the No. 1 ladies detective agency series and this second book in the series is as good as the first.  The characters continue to develop while they learn how to solve crime.  The author is good about instilling the characters Botswana way of life and beliefs into the story without feeling like it overwhelms the story.  It draws you in and keeps you entralled throughout. It is not a difficult read and can be a bit simple but not simplistic. Enjoyable book and particularly recommend if you like mystery.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|If you enjoyed the previous albums by Arcade Fire you really need to give this album a try.<br /><br />If you have loved the previous albums and you know how beautiful their music can be then you really should purchase this beautiful album.<br /><br />I do not buy much music but when I heard about the new album I knew I had to own it. I was very concerned when I read that initial impressions were negative. I was even more concerned when their SNL presence was so awkward. After really sitting and listening to the album I can say that it is fantastic.<br /><br />My initial first listen was a little bit uncomfortable. It is not uncommon for me to have a barrier of entry to a new album. I will say though that many of these songs have grown on me after only the second listen. Their music is so captivating I have no idea how else to describe it. This album has a slightly more drawn out floaty dreamy quality than the previous albums and it is amazing.<br /><br />This is a double album and it is incredibly long. There is a lot of meat here and it will take a long time to process. I cannot give any insight into the deeper portions of this music. The mythology aspect is lost on me for now. So far I am sitting back and soaking everything in.<br /><br />I have no idea how to introduce this music to somebody that hasn't listened to arcade guts before so I apologize to new listeners. I would advise falling in love with the original music first before trying jump in here as this music isn't fit diverting. ( start with NEON BIBLE)<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br /><br />The only thing I can say so far is that the packaging is really terrible. The packaging is basically two CDs sandwiched in-between cardboard. I feel that the discs are relativity safe but getting the discs out is a very clumsy experience. The only way I can describe it is that it feels like you the cd is bring held inside of a gift card holder. This is a really small detail but I felt like I needed to share my displeasure.<br /><br />Anyway, that barely detracts from the experience. Give this album a try.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|This film is Mr. Crowe at his best and the cinematography at an often good level. Buy it and you'll see it again and again.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Good story line. A fun challenging game. Worth the price and the graphics are awesome. Hard to put down once you get started.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|London really puts himself and the reader inside the heads of the dogs.  He doesn't advance an agenda and moves the plot forward very rapidly.  An easy read even if you don't like dogs, the outdoors, or the psychology of the human/canine interaction.
B00070QXL8|5.0|Love to watch funny( not corny !) stories!!!  Cheaper the high street shops! Have collected all Bridget jones movies! Will recommend this movie!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Had read Huck Finn and had to see why it got so much more love than this one.  I suppose Huck Finn is a little meatier in some issues like race.  I feel Clemens is out to show us his view of people and ideas without preaching or selling us anything - draw you in with the story and let chips fall where they may.  When he pokes fun at anyone, young or old, it's with a good deal of sympathy.
006202406X|3.0|I LOVED this series and the first two books were so well written and kept me engaged from start to finish.  In Allegiant, when the small group left the city and joined the compound, I found myself constantly asking myself-- this is it? This is beyond the gate? Disappointment is an understatement.  Tris reading about her mother through her journal...not how I feel Roth set her mothers character up to be-- sounds like a spoiled girl at times and no real insight into her motivation for jointing factions and city life. And lastly the ending...I get it. I really do, but come on. I felt like Roth was forced to do a Big Bang ending and this is not how the books set it up to go down. Inconsistent. Where is the hope? Felt let down. That's all I can say.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Maybe.  The plot line of mystery and menace builds a little.  The porn is still pathetic and I can't escape the feeling that she recruited a man to write some of those parts.  I really believe this is a good author in a genre that's a clumsy fit.  The explicit sex gets her past barriers that took authors like Evanovich much longer to beat.  But the problem remains that the men don't care what kind of shoes our heroine is wearing.  And the women don't buy the psychology of masochism.
B008CGQM10|4.0|I am not very old but this is most certainly one of my favorite books of all time!!!! You fall in love with the characters and laugh and cry all the way through!! I loved it and I am a hard person to please, but this ending was perfectly satisfying and so was the story!!!!! Now time to watch the movie!! :)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Thought this was going to be like other ho games where there's a story line to follow throughout the game but it's not. Still a fun ho game.
B005SFR7YE|3.0|Ask yourself this question: Is it possible to make a scene emotional by the music, words, and the sadness in your face and demeanor without breaking your voice and sobbing through half of the lyrics?<br /><br />The pure heartbreak of the song \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" was never do to some gasping in between the notes or a dramatic flinging wide of the performer's arms; not to me. A gentle, wistful and defeated depiction of grief is often more moving than a sobbing, almost hysterical one. When someone is not crying aloud in agony, often it is not because they haven't reached that level of pain yet; it is because they have moved beyond it.<br /><br />Sierra Boggess unfortunately ruins the sting of that song with her overacting and disjointed singing. Her voice would be absolutely lovely were she not constantly breaking it in a sob or gasp of pain. Similarly, in some of the other songs she sings (\\"Think of Me\\" and \\"All I Ask of You\\"), she interrupts her own voice with quick breaths of nervousness or excitement. All this while flinging herself about in a wild manner that is not necessary even for a huge audience. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. However, I must add that in the last two songs, \\"Past the Point of No Return\\" and \\"The Final Lair\\", her acting improves considerably, and she is actually quite convincing as being heartbroken in the last scene. Her singing, too, is not so broken or exaggerated. In other words she seems to have calmed down a bit.<br /><br />Hadley Fraser's acting is actually quite good; but his voice seems often strained on the low notes and rather than being gentle and soothing as perhaps Raoul's voice ought to be, it made me feel tense and uncomfortable.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ramin Karimloo gives a quite literally stunning performance. He seems to be able to change his voice from one of powerful command to an incredibly soft and smooth lilt. I did not know one person could have so versatile a voice. He has the necessary high range for the songs he sings without having a thin voice, and his acting performance is often wild, insane, and abrupt; in other words, very good for the part he is playing. In his case, excessive theatrics are not unwelcome: the Phantom has mostly lost his mind and being wild and impulsive is warranted. But this does not often intrude into his wonderful vocals, and he commands the eyes not because of random changes of volume which cause you to turn to look at him just to see who on earth just punched him in the gut, but rather because you want to pay sufficient enough attention to catch his every glorious note and because you must see what he will do next as his character is obviously very unstable. He also gives an incredibly touching performance in the final scene where his character is brought back to sanity by love, even bringing tears to my eyes.<br /><br />The filming of this 25th Anniversary Edition is wonderfully done; rarely have I seen a stage performance so masterfully captured. The props and effects used on stage are all quite real looking and the way some of the scenes were set up was very inventive.<br /><br />The music and story of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" are always powerful, beautiful and moving. It is actually my favorite musical, and definitely worth seeing; however, I would recommend finding a different version. Perhaps this one is worth watching on the basis of the effects, filming, and Ramin Karimloo's performance alone; but I suggest checking it out at the library or renting it before buying.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that this game is now available on Kindle Fire. Good Times. I enjoy the game even when I am stuck on a level for a month. it's a challenge. Love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fairly easy, but difficult enough to still provide a challenge.  Each item when located will be used, but if you haven't found a key, you know you are missing something.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I hate that you can't just keep on playing. as soon as I get close to completing a level I run out of life! I just want to play!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am now addicted to this series!  Cant wait uintil the movie comes out in December! \This is a must read
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game. No matter what,I play this every day! Wish I could win more bongos, but none the less I still love it.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I think the series is better but I think it's because I watched the series first be it was really good
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|App actually works unlike some of the others.  A fun challenge that progressively gets harder and harder the further you go.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|What makes law firms hot? Those guys!!I love this show so much I could watch it twice! I want more seasons!!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I knew we would need a cup holder solution for our Uppababy Vista. Based on the price and the reviews I went with this Diono organizer. We are very happy with it and use it every time. We regularly throw our keys, cell phone, a pacifier, and burp cloth in there. And of course we use the cup holders if we have beverages. It could ideally be a little longer / wider for the Vista, but it's a multi-purpose organizer so the size was obviously designed for many different strollers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very excited to be able to play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire.  It's a game I play every day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE this game. I'd played it on my phone and like using the larger screen. I wish I could use the boost that are available on the computer version.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The movie provides a lot of action.  Stallone, Scharzenegger, Willis and Norris get to take jabs at each other through references to each other's previous action flicks.  If you want some good action, this is the movie to rent
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Alien monsters vs humans in robots!  Completely over the top, but well done with a nod to anime and manga.
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|This is an Ok story with a realistic ending. Oddly enough; didn't live up to the movie. Good enough though for a holiday read.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The second book was better than the first, and they fixed the POV shift formatting problem. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A realistic view of Christ's life and how Christianity spread. If it wasn't for Paul, Jesus's brother James, and the Romans, he would have faded into obscurity.
B005544V6A|5.0|I watched season 1and 2 within a couple of weeks,I loved it so much. Started to save time just for suits .wish Prime carried season 3
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|The story line was all right, but I didn't like the nasty interplay between the main characters, although the mix of types was interesting.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show grabbed me in the first episode.  One of my favorites.  Wish I could get USA network. Glad for prime
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|i like it but not totally sure what i think its getting kind of depressing. we will see. ill keep watching :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Fabulous insight into a fascinating culture.  Do you like to learn while getting immersed in a great story?  If so, you'llmreally like this book.
B006VREN86|3.0|the acting was good, the writing pretty good, but for some reason I just did not get hooked on this series after the first episode.  Not really a family series, more of an adult theme.  May try watching it again this winter.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is as good as advertised. Lots of fun. To bad I'm now stuck on level 35 for 2 days now and can't go on unless I pay (which I will not do). Getting old real quick!
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Awesome ! I loved it I only wish I had seen it sooner. Can't wait to see the other seasons to get myself up to date.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Can't stop playing this one.  I have already recommended this one to family and friends!  cute and fun and sometimes really challenging!  Keep the sound on.
B004742Y68|5.0|It's a classic! This movie was sharp for its age and the sound was excellent. I highly recommend it for a night of terror.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I found watching the series a pure pleasure. The character developement unfolding was fascinating. Following the story was somewhat addictive to me since I had a hard time stop myself from watching more than one episode at a time.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I could have done without Danny being an alcohol and drug abuser, but I understand how it is VERY personal to the writer and does make the story have a little more direction. I do wonder how much this will hurt the sales of motor homes. All in all, a good follow up to The Shining, and I did enjoy the book very much.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|After a litte bit of a slow start, this one captivates the audience.  It is another remarkable tail by a very gifted author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|suspenseful, hold interest, fun to watch with my wife,  doesn't feel like a chick flick!  I would recommend it highly!
B00BSBVJVE|4.0|Don't expect anything but drawings. But they all made me laugh and look so cute. I saw it all in one day and I would have loved more drawings apart of what I already saw on the internet, but only a few are new, that's the reason it didn't get 5 stars. But still it's lovely.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|We are all flawed, but we can rise above the flawed and learn to be brave, selfless, honest, and nonviolent. That's the eye lesson in this series ,and I find it a beautiful and worthwhile one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Highly recommend. Hard to put down. Couldn't wait to get to the next book in the series. Totally awesome book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Overall:  The book was enjoyable and I'm happy with it overall and the later chapters kept me glued for a day finishing it<br /><br />Likes:<br />*  Grisham eventually caught my eye and I couldn't put the book down<br />*  Very interesting plot<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />*  Grisham took a long time to formally introduce all the characters making it difficult to keep up with them all early on
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I can play Candy Crush Saga anytime on my Kindle Fire.  It's more convenient than using my computer. Thank you
B00EB6F1TY|2.0|Another great movie, with another poor experience streaming through Amazon. It's amazing how Amazon can provide a vast array of services and products, including their awesome AWS (Cloud Offerings). Yet, whether I've rented movies or purchased them (which I've stopped doing so), they all intermittently buffer, buffer, buffer, fail, I have to reset, start watching again, then, buffer, buffer, buffer, fail. I've spoken to support and they run you through the standard set of troubleshooting - unplug this, restart that, bring this up in this order.. then shrug... call your service provider. Ok.<br />Yet, there's absolutely nothing wrong with my connection, internet service, Netflix, Hulu, Youtube.com... etc.<br /><br />You really need to fix that issue.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan. I love the original series of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. The movie was done very well plus the added special effects made the movie extra special. All the characters in the movie were fantastic, Overall I love the movie.
B00FEN000S|4.0|Not great but ok for what I excpected. It did have a lot of the same old theme of an action movie I like the Transformers much better and Iron man movies a lot more.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have read the entire Divergent Trilogy.  I felt that up until this book it was an enjoyable and mostly well written trilogy. The last book seems contrived and it becomes increasingly difficult to like the characters or even understand why they like each other.  Tobias comes across as moody and childish and Tris carries a &#34;holier than thou&#34; attitude through the majority of the book.  This only highlights the disparity between Tobis and Tris and makes you wonder why they love each other.  The ending seemed hastily written and made little sense overall.  I am all for authors taking risks but there didn't seem to be a point to this ending.  No real resolution was gained by the end of it.  It felt like Roth was just trying to get it over with and did so by providing a poorly thought out ending where she tied all of the loose strings up into tidy little unbelievable bows.  What a disappointment.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|very easy and intuitive to use.  simple as putting in USB drive and then easier to set up computer to TV set up.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this Blu-ray.  We both love David Attenborough.  It's educational and I'm so glad I was able to find this version over the other &#34;Oprah&#34; narrated one.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|The implication here is that Dr. Alexanders brain was \\"not working\\" during his NDE. So his visions, experiences, whatever, where manifested from some other mysterious unknown origin. Great, sounds awesome, so where is the corroborating evidence to show that during these experiences there was a corresponding absence of brain activity<br />vis-&agrave;-vis EEG's, MRI's etc? It seems the author is relying on his credentials rather than readily available medical records for authentication. Not much to ask for and a  rather large and obvious gap.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie!!  It came with some cool stuff and the Goonies game.  I didn't care much for the game as its for children but having the movie on blu-ray is what I bought it for.
B0030MKGKY|3.0|A rogue EOD specialist would either be dead or suspended from duty. I watched this with some guys who are actually headed to the EOD course and spent a lot of time pointing out what an actual EOD team would NEVER do. And a staff sergeant who was MI and a trained sniper AND EOD? Yeah, I call BS.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is a great album by Lady Antebellum.  Their music is always good as is this CD.  I love her voice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited a long time for this to be available for Kindle Fire.  Such a fun and challenging game.  Now it would be great if we could have Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes as well.
0786958731|5.0|Well, this is an awesome D&D dungeon crawling board game.  I think being that it's D&D says enough.  This was designed well and plays well.  One of the best dungeon crawler board games out there along with Descent 2.0 and Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Ashardalon.  The components are top notch and the hero variety is good.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome cuz it just has that awesome talent<br />I bought it because this looked cool oh yeah it just is really fun to play
B004X2M3N8|5.0|One of the best seasons to date in my opinion.  It will not let you down.  Matt Smith is my favorite doctor and he is good in this season.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Unfortunately not pay attention to that detail. Well, could not download the application on my android chromecast, after trying for several ways I could set it up. I put less points not because of price, but I definitely keep my Raspberry Pi as HTPC (OpenELEC)
B0013ND36G|5.0|I'm not sure why so many people dislike this movie.  I thought it was fantastic!  The ending is the best of any movie I've ever seen how they tied it together and all.  Arnold as usual was great.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|i believe that other streamer will do the job better.ok .i know.its only 35 dollar.but google dont let other android developer to have a app on google play.<br />before buying look in google in few forum about it.<br />there is a big disappointment  about this issue.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love this documentary and David Attenborough.  You can tell by my other reviews that's for sure!  This is educational and the music is fantastic!  I had to get the soundtrack as well after watching this.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I have started collecting the Narnia series on Kindle.  I have found very few errors so that it is easy to read.  The stories themselves are very good.  It's nice to be able to re-read them so easily.
0783229364|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid growing up.  I'm glad I own it now so I can introduce my wife to it.  This is classic 80's fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I liked the Shining (I like a lot of Stephen King's work) and this book did not disappoint. I really enjoyed it, Danny grown up and battling his demons, a young girl like him in danger and needs his help. King is a brilliant writer/story teller in my opinion. Some parts were a bit rough (kids being the victims of the &#34;vampire&#34; type monsters) but when I cringe even though it is fiction that tells me that the author has done a good job of getting to me with his story. I highly recommend this book.
B002KC8BSO|4.0|This follows the Evil Dead movies and is a good and also funny movie.  This is def a good movie for those Bruce Campbell fans.  I did enjoy this movie.
B000KRMZA6|1.0|I had to return the product because it is from the UK and does not play in my American DVD player. It took 4 weeks to get here who knows how long it will be to get a refund. :(
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Big Bang Theory has always been good.  Every season is hilarious and this is no exception!  One of the funniest shows out there right now on TV.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Great game.  It's fun  and challenging, but not too hard. You can skip levels if you get frustrated or stuck on one, so that's nice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun.  I think some of the level are impossible but finally will finish and move on to the next.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|It just gets better each year.  Awesome writers and excellent cast. Great to watch at the end of a hard day
B004JN1CW4|3.0|The series started off strong but I think by the time i got to The Death Cure I just wasn't on board anymore. The characters were boring and transparent,  the plot was confusing with no direction, and we seemed to be rehashing the same concepts, and the last part wasn't much of a shocker or maybe I just didn't care..
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. I play every day and find it hard to put it down. Very challenging and fun. Addictive.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love J.J. Abrams's shows and for some reason I just discovered this series.  I am now in the midst of a 5 season marathon and am hooked!
B00ENBTI8C|3.0|I know it was inevitable, but I still hated the way it ended. Overall a fantastic series though. Great characters, great acting.
B00E9ZATVW|5.0|Cars was maybe the best pixar movie made. The characters of the movie could be played out by people in place of the cars they would have driven. A beautiful story of how a race car learns to slow down and enjoy the smaller things in life.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Liked this book a lot always enjoy Nicholas Sparks he does not write filth and keeps his books interesting Love the settings in North Carolina.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good, intense story that I thought about when not reading it and even dreamed about it.  Not quite like the title might indicate.
0812550706|5.0|Child needed this book for school.  Book was in excellent condition.  It arrived earlier than expected in the mail. Child stated that this book was an excellent read for a teenager.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game, and recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles. It's just hard enough to be engaging, but not so difficult to be impossible. Worth it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have only finished the first chapter and find it hard to put down.  It really challenges your problem solving skills.  A great game.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It had a good premise. But it does take awhile to make progress in the game, and I think a lot of PC users cheat, making it less fun for everyone. My major complaint is there is no way to exit the app, so if you want it to stop running you have to use an app killer. And even if you kill it, it will start running again by itself soon after.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If I can't cast my own videos and pictures that are stored on my device to the TV what good is this piece of junk? I have Netflix and hulu, WOW! Don't waste your money until Google wakes up and removes this ridiculous limitation (that you know is only there so you push everything to youtube, etc so all your stuff is in their cloud).
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Pixar at it's finest.  Michigan director Dan Scanlon tells a great story of how Sulley and Mike meet in college at Monsters University.  Mike is of course the underdog who never gives up which teaches kids the valuable lesson to keep trying to attain your dreams no matter what.  I'm not going to spoil it for you, we purchased it before it was available on disc and it was well worth it.<br /><br />Only complaint and I'm still waiting for followup from Amazon is the &#34;bonus features&#34; which were paid for as part of this selection we did not receive.  I will edit this to add reviews of the content which was some cut features/extra features of how Mike and Sulley actually met in grade school.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|While I love the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, this one was very entertaining and spot on as well.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|Not going to tell you the 2nd movie didn't grow on us but with the same stellar cast in the first, this movie has so much heart and our family loved it.  As most Pixar films do, it teaches life lessons on top of providing top quality entertainment for kids and adults alike.  Cars is certainly one to pick up for the family if you don't own it already.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I read this on my Kindle so wasn't sure how many pages it was -- it seemed like a thousand. The first 20% of book was excruciatingly slow, but I had faith it was going somewhere so I plowed on. I'm glad I did. Alma's story is vividly brought to life through the many characters and experiences she encounters -- her insecurities and flaws make her easy to relate to. I think about 1/4 of the book could've been edited out without having a real impact on the story, but that's just me. I loved the ending.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It is a good movie if you are looking for some gripping thriller. Would give it 5 star if the climax was something different. But still worth a watch.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed the 2stories being told at the same time, how the past can affect the present. As well as both the young and the elderly helping each other, learning from each other.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|It has been a long time since I have heard a new album that is as creative, exciting, and fun as Reflektor. This is the sound of a band at the top of their game. I don't know how long their run of outstanding albums is going to last, but I for one am enjoying the ride.
B00CRMASUQ|5.0|After all this comic is pretty cool. It leaves out some important details but after all th  art is cool and they did a pretty good job. Just a tip for further readers is that it helps a lot if you read the book book before this because it helps you understand it more.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This is a great all ages movie for Halloween with fun, over the top performances by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.  Special mention to the great Doug Jones, all but unrecognizable as Billy, the undead boyfriend.  It's a great autumn romp for the whole family.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|it brings a mix of fun from the old serie over the new generation with a spin.<br />good cast and plot which is twisted enough to be good both for new fan generation and &#34;oldies&#34;
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great action. Not too much gore. I was on the edge of my seat through out the whole movie. Wow
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really great! I loved how it ended and how just the whole book! Suzanne Collins is amazing! Can't wait for movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, one of my all time fav's . Was so bummed when I couldn't play it on my Kindle . Thank you ,  Thank you, Thank you, Amazon
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It helps me a lot thanks calculator plus FREE !!! :) and it has a good memory and it doesn't tell yo the steps but it really helps
B006LSZECO|5.0|Because the book held your interest and was a real page turner.  Also, character development is very strong.  It's a real page turner.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I thought this movie was as good as Matrix, if not better in some ways.  Lots of excitement and a good story line.
B00005MKA1|5.0|Well what can i say about this album, this is a good album to listen to, this album has a different feel to it then bob's other albums, this album is lay back, and the vibes are amazing and when bob first did this album because when he release it it got criticize because of the sound and vibe on it, all of this album is talking about is Ganja and love songs, but it's a great CD, and i Really like it alot, in a matter of fact all of  Bob's CD's are great because bob was a great singer, songwriter, and musician!, he is The &#34;king of Reggae&#34;, a must have for all Bob Marley Fan's and Reggae Collection, i first Heard of Bob Marley on a Cruise that i went on in 2007, it was my first cruise and the last stop was St. Maarten and i wanted a Bob Marley bag and i saw one on the Beach it was $10.00 and i bought it, i knew who he was because i heard of him before but didn't know any of his music but after that cruise i heard all of his music and research him and i am a huge reggae fan and a huge Bob Marley Fan, R.i.P- Bob, a must have, !Buy it!, and if you are a bob marley fan and the only CD you have is legend, you need to dig deeper into Bob's Discography, and become a True Fan, like i am, and every time i listen to Reggae music and bob's music make me think that i am back at the island's, the only music i listen to is Reggae and it's the best music!, !Jah Bless! I have been a fan of bob's for about 7 years now, and after i discover bob i got into other Reggae Artist's, !Buy it! !Jah Bless!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Author Aslan has done a huge work of synthesizing all that is currently known of Jesus' life and the beginnings of Christianity. His readers are lucky that he also knows how to write well.  He acknowledges his narrative is what he believes to be the best synthesis of the available research.  He writes about an historical Jesus in a place and time of growing dissent against Rome, which years after his crucifixion would lead to a Jewish revolt and Rome's vicious suppression.  The catastrophe of Rome's destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, part of that suppression, resulted in the transformation of Judaism, the religion of Jesus. The author links early Christianity's need to distance Jesus the Jew and revolutionary to Rome's violent suppression of Judaism. \\"Thus began the long process of transforming Jesus from a revolutionary Jewish nationalist to a peaceful spiritual leader...\\" writes the author. The author's assertion that the gospels are \\"testimonies of faith...written many years after the events they describe,\\" seems reasonable enough, unless one's faith needs the assurance that the Bible is the literal word of God. Then one may need to reject this book with all the might of those other zealously written anti-Aslan reviews. For the rest of us Aslan's work is fascinating.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|Excellent set of actors. Chemistry works to produce an excellent action packed thriller with great plot twist. No gore, no gratuitous sex, no moral to the story; just a fun entertaining production. Enjoy.
B004OR199G|5.0|Do not avoid this book because it says \\"diet\\" on it.  I almost didn't and I can't imagine not having this book in my life.  It in itself wasn't a game changer, but the research, ideas, positive outlook and humorous writing make this a winner.  I've read it through twice and the second time I made notes on all the things I wanted to change in my life and either how to do it or where to further research to get additional information.  This is not a diet book, this is a cleansing book, a way to change your outlook on food, on energy, on sleep, on skin care, on water, on ridding our body and mind of what does not serve us.  She goes all out and you can follow her 100% or, like me, tailor it to what I believe, what I can handle and what I want.  My only regret was that I didn't buy it hard copy so I can mark it up. I have it on my kindle and I keep having to spend way too much time scrolling back to the many highlights that I have.  Love you Kris Carr - you rock girl.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It's a bit of a fast read, because of the style of her blog, but the book is still nice and thick to accommodate for that. It's fun and it's so good to have some new Hyperbole to read and cheer me, while also having my favorite older blog posts right there in full color anytime I want without booting up anything. It's funny and cute and I can think of nothing about this book that isn't worth the full price. I would buy another book from her at full price. That's a hint. There's a reason this book is getting such great reviews, because it really IS All That.
B00FPCG674|5.0|I could listen to these two sing anything but the lyrics are just as good as their voices. If you like good music buy this and Weight of the Globe.
B003BWERF8|5.0|The unit works flawlessly connecting my iPod to my other bluetooth enabled sound devices, thus far an altogether pleasing and dependable purchase at an attractive price.
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|I believe that it is a wonderful way to start my day.  It is always nice to remind us all to be kind, considerate, loving, respectful, and know that whatever choices we make, there is a ripple effect.  Whether it be negative or positive.  Isn't better to start and finish each day positive.  Doesn't it feel good.
1439107955|5.0|The book gives the reader an excellent idea of the discovery and treatment of cancer throughout the ages.  It helps the reader realize that our treatment to date has been mechanic in nature and only with the use of genomics can it be hoped for predetermination and foocused treatment.  I would like a sequel in a few years regarding the use of nanotechnology, stem cells and genetics in treatment.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great Show!  Missed it the first time around, but enjoy catching up on Kindle!  Sure wish it was still on as a regular series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was so into this show that I watched the whole first season in 2 1/2 days.  I love all the different types of characters introduced into the show. It keeps me engaged to the point where I am ready to watch the next episode right away.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This book is well written and taken from a point of view we rarely allow ourselves to consider.  This perspective helps to us understand and hopefully enlighten us to possible solutions.  Bravo!
B0060D3BWK|5.0|We watch this movie every year around the same time. Its a Halloween classic, and definitely worth the money to be able to watch online, anywhere.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Everybody loves it. We watch it frequently. Grandson loves it.<br />The premise is cool and so is the ending. Recommend.
B000WEMH3C|4.0|I was really skeptic about this product when I read through all the reviews.<br /><br />I have used this for about 5-6 months now, and this cover stays nicely on the grill - the wind did not blow the cover away, and the hot sun did not destroy the material of the cover. And I live in Alabama - we have hot weather here.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy set up. Was able to easily stream from a Windows 7 laptop and a Droid 4 phone. Still a little buggy running it on a Ubuntu machine, but it's more Chrome related that the actual product. I don't think 'd replace my Roku with it, but it's still a  fun toy for the price.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|As an old-time mechanical pinball fan, I found the games fun and realistic. I didn't find the ads especially obtrusive, but I only play occasionally, so I can see how regular players might find them annoying. But after all, it's free!<br /><br />A very nice app, though regular  players might want to consider the paid version.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|A lot of the reviews I read where really disappointed by the ending.personally, I liked it. This book wasn't nearly as good as the other two. I don't really like the genetic war aspect.
006202406X|1.0|Horrible and heartbreaking! I feel like I have been waiting forever for this book to come out, because the Divergent series was my favorite....and now I wish it never had. Shame on you Veronica Roth!!
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|The picture quality and sound is phenomenal. It's like watching it for the first time. Great classic Disney film. Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin for a review for this. I was completely speechless when I finished it. I am going to give it a go, so I apologize in advance if I ramble a lot. But I loved this book, so I can't help it!<br /><br />Sky by far was simply amazing. Living with her single mother, and the best friend that was always with her, she is one those girls that doesn't care what people think of her, she's blunt and say what she wants, and does her own thing. It was a major reason I just adored her. When Holder comes into her life, she tries her best to keep him away. He is the guy who is girls fall all over, and I can certainly understand why. Yes he comes across as the \\"bad boy\\", but as the story goes on, there were so many layers to him, and knowing all of this, it's not hard to fall for his character. Holder is just Sky needed, they banter between them made me laugh, and root for them even more.<br /><br />The world building was beautiful, and completely enthralling. It grabs you and there was no way it is going to let you do until you read the very last word. The connection between Sky and Holder was intense and the chemistry was filled with a passion that just leaves you breathless. It was never rushed or felt forced, it was just a sizzling, sweet romance. As the story unfolds and the truth of Sky's life, I became more anxious to know everything. I carried this book with everywhere until I finished it, that's how much I wanted needed to know the truth. But when I did, I was a complete mess and sobbing. The scenes of Sky's past that was laid out were graphic, violent and utterly gut wrenching, and even now I have goosebumps. The ending was perfect for the story, and so fitting.<br /><br />Hopeless isn't just a fluffy romance, it is filled pain, grief and unthinkable events that leaves your heart shattered, and so emotionally attached to the characters that you don't want it to end. This is a book that I will not forget, I can't wait to read Holder's POV in Losing Hope.<br /><br />Hopeless is a must read!sing Hope.<br /><br />Hopeless is a must read!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good movie, great story, wonderful actors.  It was great to see Sam Shepherd, I used to crush on him years ago.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie has it all! A little bit of mystery, suspense and hope. A great story with a beautiful ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  Love the challenges it presents at different levels.  I could play for hours but am sometimes happy enough when I run out of lives and have the choice to purchase more or simply wait with anticipation for time to elapse to gain more lives.  Forces my fingers to rest.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I just love this show. The special effects are superb. I have never seen a show that reminds me of the fairy tales I grew up with as well as this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's such a challenge and a lot of fun!!!!!!!! I was excited when I got it on my kindle.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|The story is so real to life yet holds interest to the last pages which as you might expect are her release days. Not all such stories manage to include the mundane along with the horror of prision life and keep it readable. The insight I went away with was that more than anything the prisons are a mixture of good and bad and some of the bad were on the outside of the bars. Yet some of the good are also on the outside of the bars. A really human story without an ounce of self pity.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is the best book I've read all year. So many big changes and an enormous twist and a very food ending. I never saw it coming.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Aggravating and exhilarating at the same time.  Some times the waiting is aggravating as hell, but that makes the game more addictive.
0525478817|3.0|I was eager to finally have the opportunity to read “The Fault in Our Stars” by John Green being that I have enjoyed many of his other novels. This book had a lot to live up to considering that I had heard numerous positive reviews. Indeed, I took pleasure in reading such a heroic love story; however, I was disappointed in how the plot and characters developed.<br /> In the story, Hazel Grace Lancaster is a very mature and sophisticated sixteen year old who is battling a terminal case of thyroid cancer. One day, she meets Augustus Waters, otherwise known as Gus, who has lost his leg due to bone tumors. Throughout the book, they grow as people and flourish together as they become two star-crossed lovers. In fact, Gus makes his one “wish” that he has granted to him for the sake of Hazel. Her dream, which becomes a reality, is to meet her favorite author. This part, although touching, was quite predictable.<br /> They travel to Amsterdam, only to be disappointed by Hazel’s idol. At first, the two were upset and despondent. Yet, together they make the best out of their situation and enjoy Amsterdam and each other’s company. Even though traveling to Europe with minimal supervision may sound like a dream come true to most teenagers, I kept going back to one thought while reading this book. Could any of this actually happen in real life? Is it possible that a mother would ever leave her dying daughter to meet a strange man and walk around in a foreign country alone? Answering my own question, I concluded that no, it is not a realistic plot for two young adults.<br />  Another problem I came across while reading “The Fault in Our Stars” is the intricate language used and general knowledge known by Gus and Hazel. As a teenager myself, I find it hard to believe that the characters are real life people. Because of this, I cannot relate to anything that they do or say. Additionally, such a perfect relationship like that of Gus and Hazel at such a young age is unattainable. One could argue that cancer forces kids to grow up quicker than most; however, I do not believe that even adults could possibly act as mature as Hazel and Gus did in situations presented in this book.<br />  Nevertheless, the way John Green writes is simply magnificent. His sentence structure and word choice makes the book come alive in ways that many authors cannot achieve. Credit must be given to Green in making a book about two dying children somehow happy and hopeful. The theme of courage is consistent throughout the entire novel and inspires people to live life to the fullest. Even though the characters may seem a bit unrealistic, I could not help to form a bond with the characters and care about their own wellbeing. I did become teary-eyed when Augustus passed away, proving that John Green had done his job of creating a story that provokes emotions in every day teens. Because of this, despite the flaws that I found in “The Fault in Our Stars,” I would still recommend this captivating love story to others.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Set primarily in Australia, the book relates the ups and downs of the narrator (who has Asperger's syndrome) to find a wife through a systematic and scientific selection process known as the &#34;wife project&#34;  .  It is a slightly different take on a conventional romance - the moment Rosie enters the picture (the Rosie project), we know they are bound to live together happily ever after.  There is, however, some genuinely inspired lunacy along the way.  Its great fun although the genetic subplot of the story seems a bit contrived  and the narrator's transformation into a more conventional romantic role is not exactly believable.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|This movie follows up with Tony Stark after his Earth-saving stunt in the movie The Avengers.  This one is not as good as the first movie, of course, and some might even say not as good as the second.  I'm on the fence, though -- this movie is more a &#34;Tony Stark&#34; move than an &#34;Iron Man&#34; movie.  You be the judge...
B00BRUPICM|5.0|At first, this seems to be a straightforward police procedural.  A woman is kidnapped and held caged  for reasons that are unclear.  A cast of traditionally eccentric police characters is introduced - a short detective; an independently wealthy and incredibly well educated detective; and a tightwad detective who makes Scrooge look profligate.  The hunt is on for the woman and her captive before it is too late.<br />This is a deliberately misleading set up.  In an unexpected twist, mid way through the book the captive becomes the hunted and a series of gruesome crimes are committed.  The denouement and resolution of the central mystery is entirely unexpected - a grimly satisfying tale of  cleverly executed (in two senses of the word) revenge.<br />The book in some ways is difficult to read (my wife was unable to for example) because the violence was graphic and disturbing.  But for me, it was a terrific read.  Something new and different.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I'm always looking towards expanding my collection of movies in the best resolution, at the lowest possible price, and this particular collection did it for me. It was a Daily Bargain, so I don't know if the reader can score it for the same price I did.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|Worth reading. Can't wait to see the Movie! Interesting look into the Fast Life & Crash of a Wall Street Wizard!
145168939X|5.0|This my first DeLillo novel. I think you have to look at it the way people look at Kabuki plays, not realistic but significant. The dialogue also is not realistic (people are not that skilled or precise in talking)  but it is effective. It does what the author wants. I pity the poor actors who had to voice it in the recent movie of the novel. By and large movie audiences didn't care for the movie. The novel is uncomfortable but you may want to read it again, the way you may want to return to the scene of a car accident. The plot is simple. Our hero, if you can call him that, is a 28-year-old billionaire, a hedge fund manager, who wants to get a haircut. So he jumps into his stretch limousine, which has nearly as many electronics as Air Force One, to go to the barber. Now we know that billionaires don't go to barbers; barbers come to them. But this is explained later. The limousine creeps along because the American president is visiting New York and many streets are blocked. As it crawls along as various minions of Eric, his employees, his lovers, even his doctor, enter the car. It moves by streets where a riot is going on, by a mother with a chikd begging (Eric doesn't have any bills in his pockets) through Hell's Kitchen. But where Eric is really going is to his death. Brilliant financially, and quite ruthless, he has always gotten what he wanted. Now he wants to self-destruct. I prefer to think the final scenes, when Eric meets his assassin, take place in Eric's mind.<br /> Why does this somewhat unrealistic novel have so much power? Why does it give you such a strong sense that life is meaningful and precious, that every moment counts? (I too am puzzled how DeLillo was able to create this feeling in me, considering the subject matter, but he did) He did it partly through the magic of his prose and the way he handles everything. He does not judge Eric, he does not preach, he narrates. So the novel has more impact than reading a non-fiction book about the career ofsome financial sociopath on Wall Street. Eric is very intelligent and observant but he doesn't seem to appreciate beauty. He just wants to buy it and own it. He has a lovely rich wife, he married a month earlier, but she seems to be a tourist in his life. Connecting with any woman is simply a matter of sex. Near the end Eric shoots himself in the hand because he wants to feel something. Pain is real. Death is real.You have to have a soul to enjoy life.<br /> Many readers consider DeLillo a great writer. I agree.
B00785P2QC|4.0|First timer and if you pay attention you can have an awesome city. I have not bought anything with real money and my City is looking good!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I get why she made the ending the way she did...(spoiler alert) It makes sense for the arch of the character of Tris to sacrifice herself at the end to save her brother who she loves, I get it, it makes sense...that being said I still was disappointed that she and Four didn't live happily ever after...the rest of the book is great, as are the other two.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Everything you would come to expect in a pearl jam record. An amazing rock album. Great song writting from all members of the band.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|For a film by M. Night S., this is not too bad and certainly better than his last two films.  It's just hard to buy Will Smith as a military officer in the future. His kid Jaden is all right as his son but wears a perpetually worried expression.  Mildly entertaining.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|You can't fit a whole keyboard on a kindle, but this asked if I want to play with my right or left hand, and shows me what to play and what notes to hit.<br />I almost feel I can play the piano right off the bat.<br />With enough repetition, I bet I could play the song.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love Nancy Meyer stories & this is no different.  Great acting by Keaton & Nicholson. Smooth transaction fast shipping
0374533555|5.0|Highly recommended.  I just finished listening to the audio book of this book and truly enjoyed it. This is a great book about how we make decisions and when/how we deviate from rationality. The book is written for the general audience, but it does not sacrifice the rigor of scientific writing for the benefit of accessibility to the public.  I'm going to buy the paper book as well, since I know I'll refer back to it in the future.
B00ESNE696|5.0|The Goodwife is one of the best TV programs ever produced.  Distinctive characters, solid acting and an enduring story unlike Revenge which is like watching the same episode over and over.
B003G4W49C|3.0|A good, entertaining story. Not a classic or anything but I knocked it out in just a few days and it was time well spent.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I really like this game!  I have it on all of my devices now and play whenever I get a chance.  I love the graphics, they're getting so sophisticated now.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|I seriously don't understand how so many mediocre super hero movies can make millions upon millions, but actually unique and interesting super hero movies like \\"Kick Ass 2\\" can be largely ignored in theaters and derided by so many critics. Like, \\"Man of Steel\\" got a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than \\"Kick Ass 2\\". Seriously, that awful, awful movie, \\"Man of Steel\\"!<br /><br />This was an awesome flick, extremely well-acted and well written, and a fantastic followup to the original. Usually, sequels are terrible, but this movie has escaped that curse. I hope, and bet, this will become a cult favorite.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show. It's total escape an hour at a time. Well defined characters and great writing make this a very entertaining show.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|One of Audrey Hepburn's best.  Truman Capote's novel is barely recognizable, but so what?  The movie lives on and the novel is read today mainly by those who, after seeing the movie, want to check out the book.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn was impossibly beautiful and never more beautiful than she was in Breakfast at Tiffany's.<br /><br />Some have commented on Mickey Rooney's Asian character. Yes, it's pretty bad.  But the year was 1961 and there were still millions of men not quite forty years old who fought in World War II.  I'd save the self-righteous anger for the war and not the stupid character.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works with both my ipad and macbook pro.  does a good job at streaming and allows me to continue to use my device for something else.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love dub step music but the first time I heard Lindsey Stirling this was set apart from the rest. This is a very unique style. The music will relax you or energize you depending on your mood. I love the whole album. Crystalize is one of my favorite songs
B00407PNY2|5.0|I adore this movie.  It was great t ofinally add it to my &#34;bad ass car movie&#34; collection.  A must for any car lover.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|dangggg...this is the worst ending to any book ive ever read. WHY VERONICA WHY?!?!? There was no hope...it made me feel awful!
038533348X|5.0|This was a stellar read! While I enjoy many of Vonnegut's works, this is the only one I have read that I felt truly gave &#34;Slaughterhouse-Five&#34; a run for its money. Vonnegut is at his best here, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who thinks they would like to try some Vonnegut who hasn't yet or anyone who considers themselves a seasoned Vonnegut maestro. Just a grand overall decision.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's a cool game but It freezes on me and won't let me update sometimes. But all and all it's a cool game.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Discovered this series due to the movie that came out.  Jack Reacher's character is fascinating.  Lee Child's plot is never obvious or trite...
B00ESNE696|5.0|Great story lines and top performances by all actors but especially Margolies!  Stockyard Channing is great as her mom.  What a change her daughter  has made. I live the family dynamics and intricacies.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the most beautiful version of Emma available in my opinion.  As much as I love Kate Beckinsale's Emma, there is something absolutely lovely about this rendition.  The relationship between Emma and her father most especially touched my heart.  If you are are a Jane Austin fan, don't miss this one.
B004UID2LC|2.0|They could work on this. Is takes to long for videos to load. I do appreciate the effort but please try harder. Thank you
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Evernote works really well at taking notes and syncing between devices. Some of the features offered in the pro features look interesting, but I am not sure who would want to pay $50 per year to have them. On top of that, I get interrupted every now and then to update to the pro version. I've seen some reviews of Springpad that looked interesting, but I haven't tried it.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|Full of twist and suspense,also action pack,and it's not a waste of time for watching it. I only like watching recent releases, but this one is not bad
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is the way I relax after working hard all day! Very addictive, fun and challenging, fun to play with friends.
B002APS61I|5.0|This is my favorite love story and this version is fantastic. The score is amazing. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy is electric.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|This season just keeps getting better, a much more character based drama with a new plot twist that is providing more interest than the usual goodies vs zombies or good humans vs bad humans...
1451696191|5.0|I haven't seen the movie and I don't think I will....it can only diminish my love for this book. I didn't expect the story take the turn it did, but it only made me love the characters more.

B005LVR6ZA|5.0|I can't say I've heard much of PKD, but after looking over his list of works, I'm astonished. One of the great literary minds of modern science fiction without a doubt. Ubik is definitely a must-read. I was very drawn in to its mysticism, which I did not at all expect. Highly recommended.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|999 is one of the best visual noval game I've ever played. Virtua's Last Reward is the second sequence of the game and really being consider the pervect upgrade. I highly recommanding playing 999 first before starting VLR since the story related. One last thing, do NOT ever miss these two games.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|We read this book for book club.  Very interesting discussion.  Most of the members participated in the discussion and had varying opinions on what they would have done.  I think if you enjoy a novel once in awhile this is a pretty good read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I was enthralled by it from the prologue to the last page. The characters are so rich they are like old friends by the end of the story.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I felt it drug just wasn't compelling to continue reading.  However, I did finish the book.  Wouldn't recommend it to my book group.

B00A0SICYI|5.0|Dick Van Dyke Julie Andrews how much more does a person have to say Superb wonderful...Seeing it again was a delight for me as well.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Let me just preface what I have to say with this: I'm only truly writing this on behalf of the ending since so many people have been complaining about it, and frankly, the ending is the best part in a book that otherwise sort of had me scratching my head at times.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by the Amazon reviews or spoilers about the end. Read this final chapter in the series for what it is; a work of art by the author in a story we've all loved. Yes, it's up to you whether you actually enjoy this art or not, but some of the best writers know how to create catharsis for the reader, we grow connected to these characters, and it's only natural we want what's best for them. But, we are just their companions, not the mother of their existence.<br /><br />Thank you to Ms. Roth for creating an ending that isn't swept away. It's raw, it's real, and it ended exactly how she envisioned, that I am sure.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|A super hero story was a bit of a departure from stories that Brandon usually writes but entertaining as any of his other books.  I tore through this one as fast as any book that he's written and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Can't wait for the next one in the series

B00C061HZY|5.0|Daft Punk does an awesome job moving their sound forward and creating a new era for them. Some might complain it's not as true to their original sound; which I agree with. I think growing and changing musicians tend to be the ones who are most passionate about their music and Daft Punk exemplifies that remark.
B00000FC5H|4.0|I love working around my kitchen listening to this CD....there are pieces with which I am not familiar, thus my rating...but all in all, it is genuine EWF so enjoy it.
B00EZ7K58G|5.0|This review is about the vinyl release of Jimmy Page and The Black Crowes Live At the Greek as the album was previously released in digital and CD format.  I was amazed at the quality of the vinyl at only $27.00 for three records. The sound is good and I think it will be a durable record.
B000A1KY7I|5.0|I loved the subtitled version as well.<br />This is such a wonderful, bittersweet story...very enjoyable in the English version.<br />And....it's one for the entire family.

B001NA2NM4|5.0|We watched this for a history course that I am taking.  It was sort of shocking the first time I saw it because of the content and the fact that it was filmed in 1932.<br /><br />However, it is extremely well done & was very eye opening about the lives of these people.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this camera bag for a trip to Africa this past summer. This bag is a rock star! It held 2 cameras, 2 lenses, battery chargers, batteries and assorted cleaning supplies. Perfect design and size for intended use. Don't be fooled by the price, this bag would be a bargain at twice the price. As a bonus I was able to slide my macbook Air in the sleeve pocket. What's not to like.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books and my biggest fear going into book 3 was that Four would be killed off. I honestly thought that would be the only thing to ruin this series but I was wrong.  This was one of the most unsatisfying endings to a series.  If you read the other two, maybe you should just stop there and make the rest up in your head.
0761172726|5.0|I get this calendar every year.  I finally realized I could buy it from Amazon instead of spending time looking for it locally (sorry local shops!!) The calendar works perfectly for out family of 5, with different activities and schedules every day.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|A nice overview of the politics involved in safeing our nuclear weapons.  The human factor is always the major consideration.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Really enjoyed it! Genuine moments of suspense and worry for the characters.<br />Ending was too open for my taste but emotionally satisfying.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game but waiting for tickets is disappointing, I am prevented from playing until someone sends me tickets! Also if not connected to Facebook the YOU can only play once every 24 hrs to complete a mission to advance. Fun &amp; addicting game, wish I could play whenever I want.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am sorry I ever got started with this game, I spend way too much time with it. I wish there was some instructions on how to master some of the more difficult levels. Also what seems to be the norm with one game is not the same for another, similar one. Tips would help. I refuse to buy any points, and resent the constant offers to do so. I also have no idea what it means to send or receive extra moves, as I never seem to find them anywhere.
B000LGOPW2|5.0|This version of sleepy hollow is by far the best johnny depp makes it I would recommend buying this movie it's that Good
B00EYE0ECW|5.0|I use Google Maps often. I live in a Rural area. I dont always have Cell signal for GPS. Google maps works fine.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|AMAZING I would smell all of my other apps just to get this one!!! And.... a pop up told me to rate it.
B001EBYM8A|1.0|It came to me with a broken spindle & therefore the DVD was badly scratched & won't play. I need a refund.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I suggest you to not buy this app. It does let you log in. It's just a waste of time. Kik has never given me any problems until now. WHAT THE HECK??!???????!!?????
B008RTE08E|5.0|It was wild & weird, but it arrived secure & in good condition. Thank you very much ! I am not the Walrus !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting.  Love trying to get to each level but also frustrating when you get so close to finish each level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for finally making it available for kindle..... I had been disappointed to find it  was not obtainable when I first bought my kindle but now all is well.
B00E8LUAKC|1.0|Please avoid this version. It is not a newly 2013 remaster and is not SHM. It is the old 1995 version and even states that on the OBI strip on the back. The sound quality on this version is very poor for a Japanese copy. Too bad as this is a fantastic album!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this show, can hardly wait for the 4th season..  The cast was superb, and the story line was very interesting.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|A great game and pass time, if you like this type of card games you will enjoy this one a lot.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a very helpful application just to have as a backup while traveling, but is easy to use every day. Easy to set but tricky when trying to turn off in a sleepy condition.
0810983915|5.0|This Wimpy Kid book was a request from my 9 year old grandson.  He thought it was very funny and really enjoyed it.
B003UESJEM|5.0|This was a fantastic movie for anyone who has ever been laid off or fired from a high paying executive job.  The human nature of the men and women who were let go during the last recession really holds the viewer's interest in this captivating film about having it all and losing it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Well written and hard to set down just make dinner for my family.  Defiantly a perfect read.  Get it now.
1451666179|5.0|If you have been deciding whether to order this book, do yourself a favor and just put it in your cart and check out now.  Allie Brosh's essays and accompanying illustrations will make you laugh out loud, will make you cry with laughter, and will surprisingly make you examine your own perceptions on life.  Her brutal honesty, clean writing style and near-iconic drawings really make this book a treasure.<br /><br />This is the perfect gift for people in your life that you really like; they will thank you more than once for giving them this gem.  And if they don't, then you know they're a terrible person and should at least cut them from the Christmas card list.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The power cord with the adapter works so well, I Wish I knew I needed this when I bought my Kindle. It would have saved me alot of trouble. I was having so much trouble charging my kindle and it died so quickly once it did charge that I thought I had a big problem. Thankfully it was just the cord. I am so greatful.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|I am another who did not read Eat Pray Love and am not about to. I loved The Signature of all Things. Nobody could make the in-depth study of moss so readable. Such an unusual book, couldn't put it down or stop thinking about it when I finally did.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Classic  Beatles boxset must have for any serious fan!! Pricey but worth it for what u get!!  Buy this set!!
B0096HIEE2|1.0|After all the hype, expected better.  This was not exactly what I had hoped for.  Definitely didn't like and would not recommend unless you just want to kill a couple of hours on purpose....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At first I got it to play a prank on my mother but I still live it. I get to watch stuff that was on my laptop to my TV. It came in early so I'm happy about it.
B0091W4IRY|5.0|Robert Downey repeats his role as Sherlock Holmes that helps carry the movie and keep you entertained to the very end.
B00F88H5K2|1.0|Too graphic.  Unnecessary to the story gay soft porn.  Michael Douglas over-acted and I never saw Liberace.  Only Michael Douglas's over the top impression.
B0091WQ58E|5.0|Robert Downey Jr, not only is good as iron man, but also makes this new role of Sherlock Holmes his own. He is entertaining and keeps the movies flowing to the very end.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|You'll want to read this one twice. Once to find out what happens and a second time to marvel at how it all comes together. Every scene, every bit of dialog, every character plays an important and necessary role in developing the plot and explaining not just the how but the why. It's not often that murder-mystery meets sci-fi so it's a big risk for an author to try it. Suarez succeeds brilliantly.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Waste of time and an insult to intelligence. This film would be captivating to a preteen but even then I wouldn't subject then to this.  Poor at best.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A great read by a master of his art. Le Carr&eacute; manages to make his characters real and leaves you feeling you have to know what happens to them. You forget it's just a book and a story.<br />The very best sort of fiction does that and he succeeds where many others try and fail.<br />It's wide open for a sequel. Can't wait.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game! Each level was a challenge.  I am looking forward to the next levels to be released.  I hope that happens soon.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I'm always ready to suspend some disbelief for a good zombie flick, and the book was great. I even like Brad Pitt. But this was just a travesty of completely unsympathetic protagonists getting away with idiocy. DO NOT WATCH. Listen to the radio play of the book, instead.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I highly enjoyed the first book in the series. The second book was okay but not like the first book. Then there is this book Allegiant. This is by far the worst ending to a series I have ever read and I read quite a bit. I read the book and the beginning and middle were just okay. It was hard to keep track of what was happening. Then there is the end! NO SPOILERS IN CASE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY. The ending felt rushed and it was awful. No author should end a series like she did and nobody does for a reason. If the author ever plans to write another book ever she shouldn't have made the ending like she did. I know I won't be reading her books again. I was quite excited for the movie to come out but now I do not think I am going to see it! Veronica Roth has ruined the entire series for me. I highly do not recommend this book. Make up your own ending. You will be wasting your money and time if you get the book.<br /><br />SPOILIERS<br />No one should make the main character die. I understand a side character like Uraih. But Harry Potter didn't die. Katniss didn't die! So why should Tris! Also, she didn't even die a good way! At least let her take a bullet for someone else like Tobias! The book had no structure to it at all. This the worst books I have ever read! I have read some pretty crappy books too!<br /><br />Still confused why she did this!!!
B002KVCA1O|5.0|Good collection of tunes from Rolling Stones. I Love that when I ordered the cd, Amazon provided the mp3s. LOVE Amazon!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|What can I say about this show. I cannot get enough. Makes me cringe with its gratuitous killing scenes, one more shocking way to kill a person ever single show. But I cannot get enough of it. It is such a well crafted show. Looking forward to watching the next season.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Great browser for Kindle Fire.  Like having the second option besides Silk browser on my Kindle.  Especially for viewing movie files.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|This is a fun Halloween App.  My grandkids really like it.  It keeps their attention but sometimes has a bit too much repetitive action.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I almost overlooked this movie based on what the critics said. I loved it! Fast paced, full of fun and surprise ending, what more could I ask for….
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great CD.  Very good for all ages.  This CD was very nicely thought out and arranged.  You can tell KP is maturing.
0761171703|5.0|I bought this for myself, being an ex-dancer, and I love it! Perfect gift for anyone who loves dance. It's touching, beautiful and even sometimes funny.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|It was an excellent movie. Very informative and was well acted  my whole family enjoyed it. I highly recommend it.
B0098460O4|5.0|The title says it all. While I am not particularly a fan of opera, Jonathan's voice and the synergy of this duet are both magical. Amazon's AutoRip, however, is a complete scam. I am just sorry I could not rate it separately from the music.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I missed him the first time around. So glad I saw the documentary of his life. Got a copy for my son.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. Great way to pass the time! Glad i downloaded it. User friendly and good graphics. I recommend it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Can't say enough about all of his 5 Love Languages books if you really want to give the love others in your life need and feel.<br /><br />Awesome look into the mirror as well.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Great movie to watch if you want a chuckle and not have to think...as always they built the ending to lead to another movie...No Men in Black but still worth watching during the congressional hearings
B0058OUJA4|4.0|A very entertaining twist on a tower defense game. Keeps you going back for more to try and beat the harder versions of the maps. Lots of maps to choose from keeps the repetition level down.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Great scary moments....great movie for prequel...They should have focused on other stories behind plot...Only scary movie for Fall 2013 worth watching
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Anyone who love's Stephen King books, you have to read this one.<br />I enjoyed the story very much.  A+ Book
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love this game.  I have several puzzles like this.  Very challenging even my six years old loves these puzzles.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thank you Jehovah for this wonderful tool of knowledge !!' I use it every day it's fast and easy and reliable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series was recommended to me by a friend. After the first show I was hooked and can't wait for more!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a good game.  I enjoyed solving the puzzle. It wasn't too hard  but kept me thinking. It was too short though.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|This movie was a very good one. It kept me interested and I didn't even want to get up and go to bathroom without pausing so I wouldn't miss anything. I highly recommend to anyone if you like movies that keep you interested
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|A decent romance novel. It wasn't as endearing as some of his other work. The story line was lacking a little depth in my opinion.
B00005NIE1|5.0|My daughter turned  me on to the Strokes and I always thank her for that. This album(cd) is always in my car and the vinyl in the house.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Good to great is inspirational and rich with insight. I took away life applications as well as business technique. Worth the purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Pretty fun game, that is untill it informed me that I couldnt play anymore because I was out of lives and had to wait a couple of hours. Stupid.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|It's a good movie but not really accurate,as I spent 2 years in the Nam (navy) river patrols,it was alot worse than shown.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a wonderful,awesome and amazing game .This game is like the game jewels but this game is about candy and I love candy. THE END.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):(:(:(:(;(:):):):):):):):):):)'
B0063IH60K|5.0|Too bad I spend so much time with games such as this, but, the kindle version is comparable to the pc version. I have not experienced any problems with playing the game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I am a huge Wizard of Oz fan and it was a great experience to read the book. I did find it challenging to read while thinking about how certain scenes in the movie were so different from the book. It was a great quick read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing Spider solitare, and and kindle makes it easy to plane at home or on the airplane.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|I don't know why I thought this movie was good.  Maybe because it's been so long since I've seen it, I was wanting a refresher.  It's just ok.  Could've been better.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a good and precise alarm clock app, it work great on my kindle fire,no problem at all. It's loud and the good thing about it too ;I can set my own alarm tone from my music playlist. I can even use it as a screen saver. You won't regret getting this alarm app. It worth the cents. It's also work when the kindle fire is in sleep mode.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have to admit that some of his works lately are kinda blah…such as The Partner, The Litigator.<br />But for The Racketeer, John Grisham is back to his form.<br />I couldn't put the book down, the suspense and twisted plot are unpredictable.
1416955070|5.0|I love it.I recieved the book before the deadline that you've promised.keep it that way...I'll b ur loyal customer. l
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Arcade Fire find themselves stirring up emotions and dance floor beats on their double CD, \\"Reflektor.\\" As the most famous band of their beloved Indie scene, they have to contend with being the little band that could, as in could win a Grammy for Album of The Year (\\"The Suburbs\\"). Their answer? To invoke Orpheus and the failed love to Eurydice (she's the image of the cover art), bring in Haitian musicians to lay down some serious grooves, let David Bowie sing back up (the title track) and make what feels like their least densely produced album of their career. If anything, it frequently reminds me of how Talking Heads sounded when they used \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" to open up their overall sound.<br /><br />\\"If there is no music in Heaven, then what's it for?\\" bemoans Win Butler on \\"Here Comes the Night Time\\" (the first part, the second opens disc two as a dirge), and he's here to celebrate. That means giving \\"Reflektor\\" over to James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem to make the grooves pop. Granted, this isn't Saturday Night Fever, but the percussion and bass drive better than half the album. Eurydice and Orpheus tangle again on twin songs \\"Awful Sound\\" and \\"It's Not Over\\" to again invoke their tragic love before moving onto other topics. Like \\"Porno.\\" Not as bad as the title implies, it's a slower tune that contemplates the simplistic ways that men misinterpret love, like \\"little boys with their porno.\\" Yes, Arcade Fire may be loosening up, but that doesn't mean their lyrics have gone soft.<br /><br />Which is what makes \\"Reflektor\\" a really good album. Arcade Fire are still finding ways to get their sound to new places without losing their identity. If I have any gripes, it's that the expansive grooves seem to often come at the expense of over-lenghty songs (some judicious editing - like the 5 minutes of drivel at the end of \\"Supersymmetry\\" - could have made this a single disc), and the album packaging comes with lyric sheets that tore as soon as they got caught on the CD's. But that's hardly a fault to Arcade Fire. I'd gladly take a two CD set of music this ambitious than a single disc of poorly thought through laptop pop. So go ahead, dance to a song about dying (the New Order-ish \\"Afterlife\\") till \\"we work it out.\\"s. But that's hardly a fault to Arcade Fire.

B00000JPH6|5.0|I love my movie Amason! I was soooo glad you had it as so that I could add it to my library!! Yahoo ; - )
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Enjoy the interplay between the characters and their involvement with the history unfolding in their lives. We look forward to each new episode.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I have been reading Sephen King novels for as long as I can remember and am rarely disappointed. Doctor Sleep has great appeal since the main character is the little boy from the Shining. Now he is grown up and has his own set of supernatural problems. Could not put it down
B0060ANOXY|5.0|This album really holds up after 20 or so years.  For those considering a purchase, the advice is simple.  If you like Roger Waters, you should definitely get it.  It's got the typical Roger point of view and he weaves it onto a nice album with typical continuity.  I'm not sure why the album is so underrated, but it really is in my opinion.  No Floyd/Waters collection is complete without Amused to Death.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|So &#34;Into Darkness&#34; is roughly equivalent to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in a number of ways.  I think this polarized a lot of Trekkers/Trekkies - most of my hardcore fan friends did not like this movie and this cemented their dislike of JJ Abrams new Star Trek movies.  I, on the other hand, loved this.  It was a great followup to the first redone movie, I think it was well cast, and I liked the story.  Yes, there are a few plot-holes, but I didn't find them to be large and they didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie.  I encourage new viewers to go into this with an open mind and don't go expecting great cinema.  It's a popcorn movie, and a good one!  Very thrilling action scenes, and some great dialog.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game, The Room, is a great puzzle game. I have really enjoyed this with my kindle fire hd. I use my kindle primarily as a reader,but with the responsive touch screen and great graphics, this was very entertaining.I hope we see more like this.thanks.
1603420398|5.0|No old-fashioned Granny squares here. I like the really stylish and colorful combinations. And if you can piece the shapes into anything you want with just a little imagination and planning.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was an entertaining book.  I wouldn't have normally chosen it but am looking forward to discussing it at our next book club meeting.
1449305172|5.0|Although Lean is becoming more accepted Ash was a pioneer!  What I like about this book is that it is sooooo practical.  Great job and a huge thank you!<br /><br />Stephen
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game reminds me of the Gardens of Time game I played on my iPhone. Challenging and fun! You must be patient with waiting for &quot;energy replenishment&quot; if you don't want to pay extra.
B001IASHWY|5.0|Great movie, highly enjoyable, lots of action and humour. This is one of my favourite movies, Ron Perlman as Hellboy does a fantastic job!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this all the time. it is fun and there's always a new goal to reach. I also like the subtle differences in the characters selected. Some run fast some make turns fast some jump better than others. Provides a lot of variety.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|If you use the Test Drive, you will be able to see the actual game/simulation, so I highly recommend trying it first. It has a great tutorial that covers each section of the process of building the rocket. For the in-depth tutorial alone, it is worth at least two stars.<br /><br />It is more than simply a rocket launching program. You can also try your hand at landing (on the smoon) and even working with wheels like a lunar rover. However, the skills required to determine the proper launch (through atmosphere and against the pull of the earth) make this hard for little kids. However, teens and adults will find this a great way to pass some time. It is a challenge. Great game play is a star, holding back one star due to time it takes to really understand what you need to do.<br /><br />There are no annoying permissions, so another star. Overall, great game, even if you don't get it as the FAOTD.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|The puzzles are really beautiful, but are pretty hard to do. You must give yourself time and be relaxed before you start or you will feel defeated to  begin with.  Once you start and are able to finish, you will feel the challenge and will have completed a lovely picture.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This film keeps you on the edge all the way. I watched it on a 3D television and was amazed on what the effects did. I was very pleased on the content of the film and the concept of the storyline as well.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have seen pewbiepie play scribblenauts on youtube and my friends play this game too so there for I will play it and see how it goes
B0091TGWYE|5.0|Since my first one-star review, Matt has been unbelievably responsive with his customer service.  He recognized that I was sent the wrong case (twice!) and made sure that the problem was corrected.  I now have a new Snugg case for my iPhone 5S that works wonderfully.  DO NOT hesitate in doing business with this company.  Thanks again, Matt for all your help.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm speechless. There are simply no words to describe what this book has done to me. Absolutely breathtaking and utterly amazing.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Anticipating a new book from Sophia kinsella every year and never disappointed. Funny, romantic and another successful can't put it down novel.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|After reading this book I can understand why they would want to make a movie from these pages.  I did not see the movie, but I am satisfied with what I read, did not want to put it down at night when my eyes were tired.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|You have to read If I Stay first; then read this one. It is a little whinny until the end but still a good read as I loved the two characters and want them to succeed. (I do review YA books higher then if they had been meant for an adult audience)
B009DMIZM6|5.0|This is a Very entertaining movie. It has a good plot and kept my attention. I would watch it again.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|This album is a good album and shows, and lets everyone know, Geoff Tate is not Queensryche, there are others in this bans as well. There is no I in band, and by releasing this album, getting a new singer, who, by the bay, comes from Crimson Glory, proves that. It's a good new beginning, though, I wish it was a bit heavier, but it still rocks.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|The album is definitely worth the money. Bastille really made a splash with their album. I can't wait to see what's next
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Motorhead are the one band that stands for all that is rock n roll and metal, They do what they do without question, and don't care whether you like it or not. They just run it up the flag pole and see if you salute it. This  album is no different, it rips and roars and takes no prisoners. I was waiting on the edge of seat waiting for this one, like all of them actually, and it didn't disappoint. Go get this, have a shot of Jack and a beer and turn this mutha up.
B00D48BSBA|4.0|Frederick Forsyth must have inside information to write such a realistic story. The political correctness of the procedures before action can be taken is so frustratingly real, the reader would sympathise if, in real circumstances, short cuts were taken when dealing with terrorists.<br />For an author that I thought had past his retirement date, he has shown that he is still abreast, or even ahead, of the field of current action thrillers.<br />A damned good read!
B00AW89WU4|4.0|This Dio album is a good album, really underrated actually. The remastering helped and we all know it really need it. If you're a fan, you're going to buy this anyway, it's Dio, and he really was a God amongst men. I miss him,  Just add this to the collection and enjoy this album. It should have been recorded better, but it is, waht it is. They have improved upon the original.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Nice quality and size for storage and imaginary fun to play with as a house for dolls. A good buy for any Barbie / doll lovers.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|This is the second album from these guys after getting back together. I like this one as much as the first one they did, if not more. I highly recommend this album to not only new comers, but the old fans as well. It's nice to see they decided to stick around and not run and hide again.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|Love this movie as two of the best put on great performances. This movie makes you want to locate and read the book.
B00CSSS2V6|5.0|This was probably the first live album I ever bought as a kid. I would wear the grooves out of this album. I loved the way it made me feel; It made me feel like I was there, and all the songs stood up on their, just like they still do today. I was a huge Wings fan and think Mr. McCartney should have never broke up this band, it rocked to the core. I guess if you haven't figured it out by now, you should have this in your collection, and the remastering has been done well, or as the billhillies say, it een done good..
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good writing and interesting characters.  Each episode leaves you with thedesire to start watching the next one immediately.  Hope that season three will bring more of the same.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I got this one for my daughter, and was surprised how good this album is. I find myself listening to this from time to time without her asking me to play it for her when we are driving down the road. Check these guys and girl out, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|was a good movie, like it a lot and would recommend to watch what a girl wants. 100 % please and will watch it again, so go ahehad and watch it
B00D78J7SI|5.0|This album just tears your head off from start to finish. If you like them and in Flames, get this and turn it up, forget everything and let yourself go.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|My significant other like Hamlet, he like all older movies at 26, I would recommend this movie , for me it just not me but still if theses are the kind of movie you like, my significant other was 100% please
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|Testament, one of the coolest bands ever. I have listened to this once and in the process of waiting for the dvd to arrive, which I can't wait. A testament show is something you never forget, they kick your backside so hard and leave you wanting more. Having seen them many times, and in doing radio, hung out with them and drank a few beers, and having all the guys be really cool. They make you love them on so many levels. Just buy this, and if you haven't ever seen them, take your backside to a show, and experience it for your self,but until then, get this and watch it in your living room, FARGING LOUD!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because I couldn't put it down.  Stephen King is at his best here.  I loved it.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Brilliant book - well worth the 'man Booker ' prize it recieved. Comes highly recomended as an intelligent read and is one.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett has a way of intertwining the lives of several families in an engaging and nearly-believable way (though one has to chuckle about how they happen to be on the same street in the same town in the same country at the same instant over the years). As usual, though, i loved his storytelling and look forward to reading books 2 and 3.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This is really a brain teaser. It have you using a part of the brain you haven't use in awhile
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I watched Seasons 1-3 and they were good, but the writing is sharper in season 4. Don't start here; start at season 1 and enjoy the character development. The kids especially!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It keep you on your toes, trying to figure out how to clear the board to get to the next. It is addicting. It is hard to put down
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Typical Cher.....her style is unique, her voice is amazing and she owns this!!!<br />Anyone who loves Cher must get this CD
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is one of the awesomest games I have ever downloaded,even though it&nbsp;is&nbsp;99 cent,you should buy  it,this game is awesome.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a quick, good read of historical fiction based on the orphan trains that ran between New York City, Chicago and the Midwest during the late 1800's through the early 1900's. Kline doesn't mince words about the horrors many children experienced when they were &#34;adopted&#34; off the trains but also includes some stories about successful adoptions, mainly of babies and toddlers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the fact I can know play on my kindle. Not so for my husband hehehe.<br />It is so addictive I go from here to my phone and back. The higher level the harder and the harder the better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's great to have this game on my Kindle, finally.  The graphics and colors are bright and big.  It's a fun game that is nice to have handy for times when I want something to occupy my mind but don't feel like reading.  But be very careful, it's easy to get addicted to this game.  Of course, the fact that you only get 5 plays at a time helps to keep you from wasting too much time playing.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I love the different types of game modes. And it's an easy and fun game. I really recommend you get this game.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the fact that I can bring this up in the middle of the night to see what time it is and that it will ring even if my Kindle is off. But there's really no way to keep it on all night without it's light shining in the room, too brightly.  Even when my Kindle is dimmed way down, it's still too bright in a dark room.  But it's functional and handy.
0061950726|4.0|This is good book.  I was unaware of the events leading to the actual &#34;Orphan trains&#34;.<br />It certainly was quite logical to accept a teen boy to work on the farm, in the &#34;business&#34;  or whatever was needed.  Babies were/are always  welcome in the family, and I suppose the &#34;middle&#34; children, not as desirable.<br />The characters were well defined, and I guess, most people like a Happy ending - not matter how soap opera it seems.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I got this app on my Kindle so I could make notes in the middle of the night when I wake up with a great idea and know I'll forget it before I wake up for the day.  It's so much handier than a paper and pencil, since my Kindle is always lying on my nightstand!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was too much stretch of the imagination to be plausible. It did not appear to be one of Grisham's better reads.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I totally enjoy this very well written, acted and directed show.  It's a don't miss and I am so glad it's still going.
0316219266|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. There are occasionally books that come along that I just can't seem to put down. I read almost all of this book in about 1 day simply because I found the story so engrossing. I already ordered it for two friends and recommended it to another half dozen in the last 2 days.<br /><br />Simply put there is so much fascinating content, from the explosion of the internet and how businesses succeeded and failed in this new way of doing business, to the tactics (love them or hate them) that amazon used to become so successful. Being an entrepreneur and someone with a deep technical background I found the book engaging from both of these perspectives.
0887081770|4.0|I didn't realize how small this book was when I bought it. The book is a flip out book where pages flip up or down or out. My son is not very careful with things so I thought this would get broken fast, but it has stayed in pretty good shape.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting game, hard to stop playing once you get started.  Fun to see if you can get 3 stars.
031623480X|5.0|I ordered a coppy for my Doctor, he thinks it's great as do I. Easy to read, clear well resurched and put together. It's hard to find accurate information. We have looked into this one, it's for real. By chapter 4 I was in shock and planing a new family menu.
B005NAE04E|5.0|There are some people who say that London has no heart and if it has a soul it was sold, wrapped and delivered to the devil a long time ago. It is no use arguing with these people; what ails them will not be cured by reason or logic. It is quite possible that there is no cure, that they may be saved but never healed. I am convinced, though, that if there is a cure, it will come in the form of something very much like Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere. The first thing that the former doubter will notice is that London, far from having no heart and no soul, has a surfeit of them.<br /><br />For, like the doctor from Gallifrey, London has two hearts and, unlike the doctor, two souls to match. Within one heart and one soul lives the magical, infinite variety of London, with its evocative place names, its ghosts of eccentrics, stuffed shirts, urchins and poets, heroes and cowards; and its streets and alleys that echo with footsteps long buried beneath rubble and stone.<br /><br />It is this London that Gaiman plays with in Neverwhere. His London Below is not a parallel London. It is an intersecting world, coloured and shaped by London Above. There, in that intersecting world, the Seven Sisters are a fabled family, not a place; Serpentine is a feared but sensual figure; and just to keep the balance skewed, atop Centrepoint lives a denizen of Below who is only comfortable with distance between him and the ground beneath. And as if part of the reality of both, London's cavernous sewers run like a fetid umbilical cord between London Above and London Below.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, a book of imagination and inspired storytelling. Gaiman has a knack for seeing the curious and odd in the ordinary. And despite the fact that most of his female leads are all variations of the same character, there are so many more who are delightful, even when they are not completely original or fresh. The dark ally, the Marquis de Carabas (from Perrault's Le Maître Chat, ou Le Chat Bott&eacute; (Puss in Boots to us) is a great creation; the implacable murderers, Croup and Vandemar are a classic villain combo - one smart and eloquent, the other a simple, single-minded brute - who are Gaiman's vehicles for the best comic lines in the book.<br /><br />Gaiman's best works are fairytales (or \\"otherness\\" tales?) that are not weighed down with gravitas: Stardust, The Graveyard Book, Neverwhere and even his collaboration with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens . Each one of them is a better book, a greater feat of the imagination, than his slightly ponderous and self-consciously pop American Gods. In his otherness tales, his skill with language joins with his talent for story and his own alchemy of imagination transforms skill and talent into gift.
0307586901|4.0|It is probably cheesy but I wanted to see the ideas Martha had for holiday decoration.  I am pleased to report that she lived up to her reputation of clever easy craft ideas, best of all most of them are cheap!  I tried her Easter egg decorating ideas and appeared above average ingenious when company arrived for Easter dinner.  The projects have clear instructions with pictures for those who only read instructions as a last resort—yeah, you know who you are.  For more craft book reviews check [...]
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|total disappointment! the idea is great Google but this device lacks reliability. the power adapter stopped  working in the first 2 mins of operation. I had to use one of my own adaptors. the software crashes randomly and quite often during playback. although &#34;ready to cast&#34; sometimes it is not discoverable and I need to reboot it. the video quality randomly drops from hd to low res with no apparent reason. and yes, I am an experienced electronics user. and no, it is not a fault of my tv or wifi network.  btw I use Google Nexus 7 FHD amongst other devices. sorry Google maybe a few s/w updates later or h/w versions later. I wanted my kids and wife to use such an idiot proof device but it is a waste of $35.
0307949486|1.0|This is a book filled with debauchery and violence of every imaginable variety but with only a so-so mystery. I had the killer down to 1 of 2 people, possibly both, and had the eureka moment experienced by the investigators before they had it. It takes place in Sweden, though the only way to know this is by reading the introductions to the book segments and trying to read the names of places. Speaking of book segment introductions one of them states, \\"92% of women in Sweden that have been sexually assaulted have not reported their most recent incident to police.\\" Think about it.<br /><br />The book chapters are broken into spans of dates, i.e. \\"June 19th through June 29th\\", \\"July 11 through July 13th\\", for no apparent reason. The only character I liked was the patriarch, Henrik Vanger. All other characters had serious character flaws, to the point of being unreal. When he's not getting laid by the nearest woman in sight the protagonist is making coffee. Coffee, coffee, coffee. The author name checks props, almost as if there were product placement, \\"Lisbeth took out a Canon digital camera\\", \\"the man had a Hasselblad camera\\", \\"he called her on his iPhone\\", etc.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like violence, debauchery, torture, and licentious depravity, this is your book. There are multiple murders, sadomasochism, torture, violence with knives, guns, and tasers, animal sacrifices, animal cruelty, bestiality, beheadings, parent-child incest, sibling incest, rape, bondage, immolation, suicide, adultery, homosexuality, lesbianism, fornication, anti-Semitism, emotional abuse, libel, extortion, embezzlement, and let's not forget Nazism, then this book is for you. If you were looking for a fast paced thriller-mystery, not so much.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A good adventure movie that is as exciting today as it was 20 years ago.  The streaming quality was good.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I've read all the Bridget books and by far this one is the best.  I was so engaged with the character tha I found myself exasperated, overjoyed, sad and crying towards the end. Loved it, loved it, loved it!
1451666179|5.0|Followed my boyfriend around the house trying to read it to him, but couldn't because I could not stop laughing.  Finally just had to hand it over so he could read it himself. I could tell which part he was at by the way he was laughing.  The parrot one!  Oh golly oh golly!  The maniacal looks on the little girls' faces!  Buy the book.  Buy it now!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Bought this set as a gift (I have my own set).  The receipent said she had planned to watch on long winter weekends, but got hooked right away and has already completed the seasons and wants to know when we can get season 4!  Who doesn't love Downton Abbey!
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and a fairly interesting way to present the timeline of the story. Predictable but it doesn't dampen the fun.
B00G118LYY|5.0|My  favorite  part of toca cars is that I get to run over all the houses and buildings, I also get to build the town and when I'm done I destroy it and start over. so if your thinking of buying it buy it!.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Very happy with my purchase and would gladly do business with again. Have no problem recommending them to other people I know.
0525952926|3.0|I had trouble keeping track of the second generation characters.  They also weren't as interesting to read about.  I will still read book 3 of the trilogy.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, its awesome and challenging and you can unlock a multitude of different levels as well as upgrade your vehicle of choice, I have recommended this game to many people of all different age groups and all have found it fun
B0067TQQI8|2.0|The idea of having this unit to charge your phone or iPad when you don't have electricity is good but this product not good. The adapter that fits my Samsung Galaxy Note II cell phone stopped working after the first use. If I was able to use the USB cord that came with my cell phone, this would be an excellent product.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I really liked this movie, it got me hooked on the TV show as well. It catches your attention and you want to keep watching to find out what happens next.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Season 4 is already so good. The show is finally starting to resemble the comics. Here come the zombie herds!
B0067Q42BY|2.0|It turned out not to be as interesting as I had hoped it would be.<br />Also very difficult to get started with it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|tbere were too many product endorsements. tje cliche hollywood ending made any scary scenes irrelrvant. appreciated the authenticity of the AA scenes.
B000FBJG04|3.0|It is just another story of an outfit, company or individuals accomplishments during World War 11. I applaud and thank them for their<br />sacrifices  they made to keep us free.
B004JMY312|4.0|It was a great movie. Creative classic, and I would recommend to people of all ages. Good deal on Amazon to rent from home considering it's not on Netflix or Redbox
B00AV68GOA|5.0|i am waiting patiently for the second sxcript,  i like to read it in this form evenb after seeing the seriers
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I like a well-written steamy erotic read every now and then but this was just bad in every way. Bad writing. Bad characters. Bad story line. The devil is in the details and the details were not realistic. For example you can't tell me there is a college girl that does not have her own e-mail address. HE had to get one for her. Not realistic. Make him a millionaire OK, but a mega billionaire that is super young, super gorgeous, a pianist, a pilot? Over done. Not believable. I love to read fiction but I want it to be believable and realistic and something that transports me away. This was a waste of my time. Will not read the other two books.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Funny, lighthearted an easy read. I could relate to many of Tina's stories from my own time growing up.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If it were possible, I would have gave four and a half stars.  It was a great read and my only problem was with the ending.  Almost anti-climatic, because after the great revelation the story seemed to drop off to me like he had to end it in a hurry. But it does have me at least going into the second book with any expectations.
B009A87X80|5.0|This is one of my favorite cd's. Amazing voice, beautiful renditions of some familiar songs.  My husband keeps trying to &#34;borrow&#34; it for his car.
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|This will allow to look at the forecast in my neighborhood and in other cities. This is very reliable to me.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is  a great game to keep my granddaughter occupied for a long time.  She likes it because it gets progressively more difficult at each new level.  I like it too, but am no match for a 10 year old.<br />The game works very well on my Kindle Fire and has not caused any problems with the device.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written. Pithy. A love story of magnificent proportion. A great read even for adults. I highly recommend it. Jane
B001AEF6BI|5.0|My daughter has watched \\"Pitch Perfect\\" a thousand times. They reference \\"the Breakfast Club\\" movie in Pitch Perfect...so I wanted to go down memory lane with my daughter and bought the Breakfast Club DVD so that she could see what life was like for her 80's Mom in High School. the Breakfast Club is my \\"brat pack\\"!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed the journey this took me on. We read this for book club, and provided an interesting discussion.

B0068THAGY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It kept me entertained through its entirety. While it's not necessarily the most unique story, it was done very well.
B004JMY312|5.0|We introduced this movie to our 8 year old this Halloween.  It was so much fun and we're still talking about it!
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|This movie is funny and entertaining. Some silly parts t overall, it is a fun movie to watch. Product arrived on time and new as stated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Many challenges-plenty of strategy needed and a little bit of luck makes this a great App!!!!<br />Wonder if there will be a sequel.....just saying
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|each season takes you down a different path in a world full of zombies, they are not the biggest threat.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|The extras that come with this and the cool layout of the CD'S (not to mention all the HOURS of bonus material) is totally worth it! I'd buy it if I were you!
B00B52F278|5.0|Absolutely loved this series & own it all! Even though I knew the history of the event & how it would end, I liked Starz ending better than the original movie which starred Kurt Douglas! It gave our hero a much more honorable end than I remembered from Kurt's movie! My hat is off to Starz for this most excellent effort in recreating this most memorable time in the history of ancient Rome & the world of the gladiator!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Why would someone buy this to attach to their tv and be limited to what you are able to stream to it? Why not just pay $30 for VGA and audio to HDMI converter and connect an actual computer to your HD TV? That's what I did. I use my 47\\" HD LCD TV as my monitor for my computer. I have a wireless mouse and keyboard also, so it makes it easier. Or if your computer already comes with an HDMI output, connect it instead. This is a gimmick, like a lot of the new products coming out, that people will lose interest in and will fade out within a year.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I really have enjoyed watching Dexter & will be a bit disappointed when it ends! This season was good & the ending, while not a total surprise was quite satisfying since I was quite glad to see The Captain get what she deserved! Also I thought the Ukrainian Mob boss was very good & I was sorry to see him go near the end! Why is Dexter drawn to blondes though, especially bleached blondes! He needs to try a brunette for a change as maybe he will have more luck next time!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great app love all the sounds and that you can mix sounds. I use this app for daughter it would be nice if there was movement to go along with sounds too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love this show can not wait for next season!!! :) Does anyone know when it starts on TV or if it has started when can we watch it online?
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great acting abd script suoerb. A little keft leaning but ok otherwise excellent. Alan cumming us a delicious and great actor
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|This game makes me laugh.  It is nonsensical and allows the stress of the day to just melt away.  Plus my bowling scores are pretty good, too.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|My kids like to play the game, but since they do not have FB they can not get past level 20 without purchase.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Trite story, shallow character definition, doesn't challenge the reader.  I guess I'm most disappointed because I expect more from Sanderson.  This would be a good graphic novel or comic book, but not much as a novel.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I like the game slot but u have use all it gems and energy and coins to get a boy friend
0525478817|5.0|This book is both tragic and hopeful.  A simple story but completely complex.  It is a story of two teenagers who have terminal cancer but fall in love.  I let my 13-year old read this book and though something intimate happens between the characters it is not described in detail and I felt it was okay for her to read because the rest of the story is so moving.  I recommend this books to adults all the time.  It would be great for book groups too.  I really think it is a fantastic story and hats off to John Green.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great Show! Can't Wait For The Next Season! I Highly Recommend This Show To Anyone Who Enjoys Legal Dramas and/Or Romantic Dramas!
1476727651|5.0|This was a great purchase. The book was shipped fast and arrived in excellent condition. Stephen King is a wonderful writer and this was an excellent read. Love it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This by far my favorite book of this series. However I fail to see how this is not the last book. I will probably not read the other books I simply feel this story ended. I'm an avid reader and the only thing I hate more is when authors overwrite a story. When you finished the story just end it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun and very addicting. Great way to pass the time when waiting at an appointment or ready to call it a night.
B003TSDI0E|5.0|Sophie's World.<br />This is an excellent book for young readers. An introduction to thinking carefully about things and situations.<br /> Challenging and exciting.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie follows the book fairly well.  There are plenty of differences and the book is always better than the movie.  That being said, I thought that the movie was very well done.  The acting was good and the characters believable.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I admit it...I am a real Stephen King fan...one of his &#34;Constant Readers&#34;.  The biggest reason I am I love Mr. King's work is because of his incredible research and amazing character studies,  Mr. King gets you into the heart and soul of each and every one of his characters, and you are totally invested in what happens to them. When you finish one of his books, it's like you're leaving your beloved friend behind, wondering...what happens now?<br /><br />Ordinary people, extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />&#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is the ultimate fan payoff!  If you read &#34;The Shining&#34;(and I suggest you do [again] before you read &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;) this picks up years later,  We get to know the older Danny, all the while reminiscing with him; re-living his past terrors and grieving at what he's become - and what he's going through today.  You hold on page by page watching him emerge as the true Stephen King hero we fell in love with when he was just a little boy.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing.  When you read &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;...take a big nap before you do.  This is one book that only hints at &#34;sleep&#34; in the title - and I'm pretty sure you're not going to be able to stop and take a break or go to bed once you start reading this!  For Stephen King fans, this is truly one of his best treasures - and a guaranteed an all-night read!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Awesome Movie, and way better then the original. I feel this movie followed the comic a lot better then the last one did.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I sell my paint paintings and other random things on eBay and the eBay app is very helpful for me!!

B00BIPKROU|4.0|If you like drama then this show has lots of it. Quite engaging. It has work, family and political drama.
0307743659|3.0|Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic, desperate for a new start. He drove drunk regularly, drank heavily daily, and was encouraged by his alcoholic best friend. Two events changed his life: breaking his son's arm in a drunken rage and hitting what turned out to be just a bike on the highway with his best friend. Now he's on the straight and narrow. Jack, his son Danny, and his wife Wendy move into the historical and grand Overlook Hotel for the winter to act as caretaker, running the heat, doing maintenance, and making sure the hotel can open easily in the spring. The hotel has other plans and mysterious things start happening. At first, the happenings are relatively harmless, presenting as horrific visions, but soon, the visions give way to violence and horror. Can the family escape the hotel before it's too late or will they perish in the Overlook Hotel?<br /><br />I know the story of The Shining very well. I first read it when I was about 10 or 12 years old and I remember absolutely loving it. Afterwards, I saw the various film adaptations and the story is still creepy and effective. This is the first time I read it as an adult and parts of it still hold up. It's one of the few ghost stories I like. It doesn't bring in religion (which is a pet peeve of mine as few of them are done well). It focuses on real life problems through the supernatural and the struggle of good versus evil. The Torrance family never really talks about their problems at all. It's the big elephant in the room that no one wants to acknowledge. Poor Danny doesn't know what's going on frequently with the situation with his family, reading peoples thoughts, seeing horrific images around the hotel, and finally being attacked by the apparitions. The only way they actually mention anything about Jack's drinking or anger problems are after the supernatural phenomena are present. It allows the family to unite (for a time) and address their problems. Jack Torrance is an interesting and deeply flawed character. He has a drinking problem and anger management issues, but he's a good person at heart. He cares for his family and wants to succeed for them. This job at the hotel is his last chance at success. The hotel exploits his flaws and turns him in to a literal monster, tragically destroying any humanity left in him.<br /><br />The Shining has a lot of flaws that I didn't notice when I was younger. The writing is mostly good. King writes characters well and gives them little habits and quirks to make them memorable. However, the descriptions of everything and delving into every single detail of the characters' pasts just grew tedious. I wanted to move forward with the story instead of constantly revisiting the same past events through different perspectives. There was a lot of telling rather than showing. The reader can make connections in the text without it being explicitly stated and I felt that it was overkill to do so. I also had issues with Wendy and her choice to stay with Jack after he broke Danny's arm and beat a student rather severely. Her passivity and willingness to stay with Jack despite huge red flags simply disgusted me. Her reasons for staying were rather selfish, centering around not wanting to live with her mother and show that she failed rather than thinking about saving herself and her son from abuse.<br /><br />The Shining is a good novel that I enjoyed. Parts of it dragged along and the writing was not always engaging, but the overall story and characters make the novel a classic that will continue to be popular for years to come. I hope the sequel Doctor Sleep is as good as, if not better, than the original.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the way he showed the way Don Torrence dealt with the shining while trying to maintain his sobriety. As usual, good character development
1451666179|5.0|We've been waiting and waiting for this book to come out and, of course, it is awesome!  I need to buy one for our vet's office as one day, I was in there and the girls at the front desk were both crying after reading a book about dogs going to Heaven.  I told them they needed to go to your website and read your witty dog stories and they would then have tears of laughter!<br /><br />I hope sometime in the future (no pressure of course), you would write this book for children (without the &#34;F&#34; words which don't bother me but some moms may not like that part and this book is too good for anyone to miss).<br /><br />Thanks for finishing it.  I know it was a long journey for you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a really great &#34;edge-of-your-seat&#34; book.  If they haven't made a movie from it yet, it's probably just a matter of time.<br />Fast paced,  entertaining and the ending leaves you scratching your head for quite some time. I read it in one day on the plane home between London and Houston. Admittedly, it was a long day, but I didn't want to put it down.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|After falling in love with the movie, I wanted to read the book.  The book is different, but very good.  I'll keep it on my Kindle to read over and over.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Heart breaking and heart warming all at the same time! I had  such a love/ hate relationship with the main character. A wonderfully exhausting read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game you sometimes for get the time you want to beat the borad so bad sometimes I just want to see what the next borad looks like
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Ohhhhh my.<br /><br />One of the things I liked about the previous two books in the series is that the action flowed along at a brisk pace to keep the reader wondering what would happen next. This particular installment is awfully wordy. I found myself thinking \\"Just get to the point already\\" more times than I could count.<br /><br />The alternating point of view between Tris and Tobias was a good idea in principle, but not so much in execution. Both of their voices sounded exactly the same. When I was a kid and reading the Babysitter's Club series, once of the things I appreciated even then was that each character had her own voice. There was virtually no difference between Tobias' and Tris' chapters.<br /><br />This, then, leads me to confess that I still do not feel any attachment to any of the characters. I felt like there was not much growth going on except in the area of Tris' and Tobias' relationship. If you're into teen romance and awkward angsty teen relationships, maybe that will appeal to you. It didn't do much for me. Caleb, truly, showed the most growth out of any of them, but is never given the opportunity to truly redeem himself.<br /><br />I feel like there is far more worth discussing about this novel, but I am unable to do so without revealing some pretty massive spoilers.<br /><br />Is it worth the read? Sure, if you just want to know how it all plays out, and don't mind awkward teen romances and a disappointing ending.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Not my type of game I didn't really like those kinds of games. It wasn't really what I thought it would be.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|i am not usually scared by films, but this had a couple of good moments! i read up on it and one of the children (now adult) who lived in the house said the director did a good job depicting their reality. not sure about that, but it was a good movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga  I love this game so glad you was able to put it on my kindle now I can play it more thank you
B001HM1PFO|5.0|It's easy to view a film like this as simply a time capsule - providing a glimpse of another age: the clothes, the hair, the styles, the language. But that would overlook the brilliance of the songwriting; both the musical cues that satirize Hollywood and Broadway simultaneously as well as the very witty lyrics and catchy melodies. It would also undermine the truly great acting that's going on. We're not only introduced to the genius that is Tim Curry but the equally great comedic turns by Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, not to mention the over-the-top Meatloaf. O'Brien had lightning in a bottle with this one and to just think of this film in terms of what costume one should wear while watching it, or when to squirt your water gun, would miss the point: this film is a cultural milestone that delivers in all the areas in which a great film should.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This game is a good game I play it just about every day. It's entertaining and keeps you on your toes lol
B002T9H2LK|5.0|This movie is a wonderful depiction of war and drama and the realness of the characters are damaging to the weak hearted...I don't think anyone made it...lol...great story and the actors displayed a tremendous amount of talent vocally and visually...great film all around!!!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|This book takes the reader on a wild and crazy ride. I found myself pulled into Gabriella's world (much like her legions of admirers) and wondering what outrageous thing she was going to say or do next. Who knew a cricket match could be that entertaining?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love this series. Lots of drama keeps me coming back for more. Great actress and actors. Intrigue and romance are a recipe for success.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well developed plot and characters, definitely reading the series. The movie does a good job of telling the story as well.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|Could this happen today?<br />This is a timeless movie with a cast of super stars from it's era of the cold war.<br />It should be recycled and updated.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|This app froze my phone set; only after several re-starts was I able to uninstall. This was made even more difficult as the app constantly dimmed the screen into darkness.<br /><br />I nwouldn't recommend this app.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|This film is very scifi fantasy....good if you are into fiction movies with a lot of robots. Bad if you like movies that are not far fetched.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I found this book to be a very interesting and entertaining read detailing all the amazing interactions between current and former Presidents
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|It contains most of the hits, plus songs that he wrote for others that became hits. It also contains my new favorite Richard Marx song &#34;Through My Veins&#34; written in honor of his father, which resonates with me having lost mine two years ago, which is heartfelt and profound... It also features Matt Scannell, Sara Neimietz, and Hugh Jackman... Richard Marx is the definition of Singer/Songwriter/Musician..., one who unique and who sounds just as good live, as he does on record. If you are a fan of his, or just a fan of great songwriting and music, you owe it to yourself to get this!!.
006202406X|5.0|Even tho it ended the way it did it was an amazing book! Veronica Roth truly is a brilliant author.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Would read it again. Great for group discussion.  If you like non fiction great book.  Love love love it. Must read
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very quick read.  Well written!  Would recommend this book to my friends.  Good sense of humor.  Could picture characters very well.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|For those who have read my other reviews of Steven King's works you know that I think that King is hit or miss. This book I thought was pretty good. King takes an interesting premise and keeps you reading with suspense. You keep reading wanting to know how Jakes changes to the past affect the world in 2011, and trying to find out what part the mysterious &#34;yellow card man&#34; plays in the story. Those who liked Under the Dome will enjoy this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|still trying to figure out how to work it with my system. But over all it is very nice to have
B005COO1X6|2.0|So I find Steven King very hit or miss. This book fits in the miss category. The book starts off good and I enjoyed the first chapter. But by the time the 2nd chapter ended I thought the premise of the book was completely ridiculous. I immediately stopped reading. I can get into. I can get into books where a high school girl with telekinetic powers murders her high school or invisible domes covering a small town, but when King writes about a car eating people, that's where I draw the line.
B00ELOOYZI|1.0|I got the game for free, expecting a timewaster that was easy to understand. Instead, I barely got past the fourth training segment, and I didn't understand that higher level vocabulary at all! And that was just the training! This game is not exactly meant for the younger kids, and it isn't really what I'd call 'simple' either.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|There is no app I use more than the Kindle app. After the recent app update this app is now even better.The recently read books now show up on the home page along with book recommendations from the kindle store. Great app and its FREE!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This can  is cool because the goals are cool. When the goal wants you to buy something it lowers the price of the item so you can buy it.
0547884591|5.0|Great book. Not just for the recipes, but how well it ties it with the 4 hour Body. The food is a great supplement to the diet! It's the book that keeps giving!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have not been able to put it down. I love the challenge. the only problem is I hate begging for lives and having to wait 15 min. for a new
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan and this sequel does not disappoint! I loved it and devoured it in just two days.
1476727651|5.0|Continued the first story perfectly.  One of King's best books in a few years.  A must read for anyone who's a fan of the Shining.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Does what is says and I just love using it<br />I know it violates YouTube policy but I mainly use it to download content for my travels, so I can watch videos while offline.<br />When I am done watching I delete the files.<br />I wish that the YouTube app would support this feature out of the box.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This band was a little weird to me at first. I didn't think I'd really like them at all, I mostly just listened to &#34;Sail&#34;. But I started listening to more songs over and over again, and found myself buying this CD. I LOVE them now. AWOLnation either grows on you, or it's just simply not for you. I Love them!
0486424510|4.0|Not quite as suspenseful as Wilkie Collins's the Woman in White, since this book got a bit boggy for me in the middle, and the narrators changed throughout, which caused a little repetition and loss of smoothness. I found the first part of the book to be the best, with Betteredge, the house steward, an engaging character who provides the background for the first period of the story, which revolves around the disappearance of an ancient gem with evil powers. The Moonstone is, reputedly, the first police procedural ever written. There is, in that regard, a huge red herring the size of a whale. I won't elaborate further on the afore-going, so as to avoid giving out any spoilers.<br />I like that the Dover edition of this book was not only printed on recycled paper, but was very economically priced too.
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|I have always loved BMTH and I still do. This album though seems a lot lighter for them than usual, yet still dark lyrically. Overall, if you're a true fan, Buy it!
B003G93ZCM|5.0|A very insightful story, describing the emotional physical and technical challenges of the Apollo program astronauts. I loved reading it and through Gene Cernan's words &#34;living&#34; how it felt walking on the moon.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|No matter what he writes about, Bill Bryson is at the top. I have all of his books and have read some of them twice. I defy anyone to say his books are less than stellar.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Character development was less complex than many of his other works.  Got the feeling this was done with less passion..
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|If you like to be forced to buy  more to move on or join face book  then this is for you.  Found it fun until it made me choose in order to continue.  Frustrated....
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my son and he was blown away. Both he & I grew up with Legend of Zelda games and to read all this information about them was amazing. Plus the book is beautifully done! It's a work of art - truly.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|If you have played the 1st fruit drop this one lacks something.  1st 2 levels are too easy if you have played the original.  There are not enough games of the hard ones.  Would be a good one if you havent played original one first.<br />In
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I downloaded this game because it was free. I started playing and then my son wanted to try. Now my other boys want a turn! It's lots of fun.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson draws you into this world right away and keeps you on your toes. The magic system is awesome, I only wish the story was longer!
B005EIS5IW|3.0|Too many &#34;been there, done that&#34; type joke.  You know, same flavor, different presentation.  I'd appreciate more original material.  Not sure I even liked the cat.  Thought the pup waas great.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Not good. I'm sure the book is better. But if you'd rather see the movie, don't waste your time. I don't like writing bad reviews but I didn't enjoy the movie at any point. I will say the female soldier aid was a fresh addition to the zombie genre. However, everybody else's performance was lacking. Enjoy the movie at your own risk. You may regret the little money you spend.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Based on the novel, this series offers the viewer a glimpse into the &#34;other&#34; side of England---not the glamor of the manor or the sordid darkness of Dickens' Victorian London but the harsh realities and differing perspectives of the industrial North.  In particular, we see issues of gender, class and faith through the lenses of not the &#34;landed gentry&#34; or  aristocracy but of the working poor and manufacturer and the women living in those realities.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Jim Carey pure comical expert reveals what happens to regular people when empowered and noticed by others.  He always says and does stuff that we would love to do but, dare not too. The Mask is a great tale that combines a naughty but generally good hearted lad with a super hero ish twist that once amplified by the mask gets noticed by others and embarks on an adventure of sorts where he discovers himself and eventually excepts himself.  Diaz portrays the woman of his dreams and a slow but changing person with quality that rises up in her as she see's who the man behind the mask really is.  She might get won over eventually? The mask gets noticed and even beguiled by her.  Without the mask he is himself and initially that is of less interest to her than The Mask's romance and style..  This is a great film with a little phantom of the opera twist.  This film challenges you in, if you had power what would you do with it.  This even appeals to older kids and would be suitable for younger ones if the language and content was a little less strong, a great film overall.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story-telling, and acting. I watched this series during the PBS season and again on Amazon. Nice to see the details I missed the first time around.
B00170M2GW|5.0|This movie makes you feel like you are part of it, feeling the tension and even the fear.  You feel like you are in Hackman's town and oppressed by him.  You feel the fear and emotion of Stone and her courage and anger.  The humility of Crow and conviction and slow unwinding of Hackman proving his way against the town using his selfish leadership to justify his way is very compelling. DeCapprio always delivers young enthusiastic lad seeking approval and dying for it as he shows his father's enemies fair play and challenges Hackman for his fathers approval.<br /><br />These elements relate to many peoples real lives.  In business a bad leader kills others off (career wise not physically) to make themselves look good and retain control through fear control.
B0000039QA|4.0|I didn't know how good this cd was when it came out years ago. I am glad that I did make this purchase. It's sad that B.I.G isn't here to continue on with his music.

0375869026|5.0|This is a beautiful story about kindness.  I have purchased this book for my elementary library and I'm currently reading it to my 5th grade classes.  I recommend this book every chance I get.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Its a great little smarttv device, I strongly prefer it to my TV's built in &#34;SmartTV&#34; software.  Works perfectly basically every time.  Unfortunately it only really works with Netflix and YouTube, hopefully that'll change eventually.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book caught me off guard and kept me turning pages.  I was so sad when it was over and I couldn't be with the characters.....all of whom found ways to express themselves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Kindle for adding on Candy Crush....I already love my Kindle and this just makes me love even more.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Disappointing ending but Dexter is still great and maybe the writers can come up with a Dexter movie. Maybe the death of Deb could have been just a dream to a way out and Dexter just disappeared to his logging job and it picks up from there to save Deb. maybe an idea.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So often the third book in a series can get diluted and not much more than a rehash of what's gone before not true here.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These are definitely some cheap knockoffs, and I usually have had poor luck with lithium batteries for laptops, phones, etc. that are knock offs.  These seem to be holding up, though.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great cd, I'm a drake fan, so I'm biased but nothing was the same, was an excellent cd...and i loved how I recieved a digital download as well as the actual cd
B008PZZYB2|4.0|The movie was very funny.  There was a lot of hidden joke so be very vigilant when you watch it.  Its very entertai ning. You have an open  mind.
B00DJWV11I|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book I really was! I bought this book 5 months ago and was saving it for a long trip that was approaching because I just KNEW it was going to be so good! Smh I was so wrong that I screamed aloud while only being 15% into the book! I was mad that I fell victim to the high reviews *sigh* First off the book was written in first person from the \\"male\\" perspective and I put the \\" \\" around male because this book TOTALLY read like a woman and not a man at all.<br /><br />I honestly found the writing perspective super annoying I found myself rolling my eyes and putting my Kindle down. It took me 3 weeks to finally finish this book because I'm one of those people who HAS to finish a book once I start it. I didn't feel any connection to the characters NONE and I mean NOT A ONE character and I hate that in books I really do! Especially in books that cost as much as this one *insert VERY hard eye roll* Like I work hard for my money and when I do spend it, it makes me mad when I think I'm getting quality and the truth is I'm getting nothing close to \\"Q\\" in quality.<br /><br />There is nothing about Drew that made him a likeable character he seemed more like a horny high school boy than a 28 year old man. There was no love development at all it was ALL about/based upon lust, all Drew did was talk about how beautiful/sexy but mainly how hard Kate made his peen. Like this really read like we were trapped inside the mind of a 16 year old boy who just found out that sex existed. There was no foundation laid for a real relationship or connection to even be had for Drew and Kate. Like I said he spent most of the time talking about his peen and how hard it is when Kate does this or that.<br /><br />It was super annoying and just again made me mad that I spent this much on a book that is hands down a piece of crap that isn't worth the energy spent reading the synopsis. Now I know this may sound mean and like I'm bashing the author and I'm not I'm bashing the amount that this book is priced. I'm telling my dislike with the contents within this book ONLY and not the author as a whole but then again to charge this much for a book this horrible is just all the way wrong. In my opinion DO NOT buy this book save your money and some brain cells.bashing the amount that this book is priced.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I picked this little device because it was cheap and I could just use my phone as a remote which seemed like a cool idea. Unfortunately, the reality is that the apps suck at controlling the Chromecast. Using the Netflix app in particular can take a full 2 minuets from the time I tap on the app until I get something up on my screen.
B004RX03NK|4.0|I have recently gone on a Sylosis binge. Their latest album is quite a bit better than this one in my opinion.<br />However, this one is quite good. Very bummed they didn't make it to the Devil Driver show. Get better soon guys!
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This movie is virtually untouchable in the annals of moviemaking. Peter Sellers was peerless with George C. Scott. Stanley Kubrick's genius shines throughout the film.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book. I couldnt waite to see what the secret was when I read the promo for the book.It is a real mystery at the beginning trying to figure what it  had to do with the Berlin Wall. The further you read that all makes sence. I recommend this book.
B00942Y35S|4.0|This delightful fairy tale of a girl cursed with a pig's nose is suitable for the whole family.  The film is made stronger by excellent supporting actors and actresses, including Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones, Death at a Funeral) and Reese Witherspoon.  This movie is cotton candy, but it is very good cotton candy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun a must buy and easy to to win. It's also sorta addicting. I would recommend this to anyone
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the book and was emotionally attached to the characters. I liked the way the author connected the characters together.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|The Black Eagle Inn is historical fiction with heart. Christoph Fischer does an excellent job blending detailed accountings with emotional characterizations. The end result is story that makes you feel as though you are deep in the heart of Bavarian Germany during the most tumultuous time in history. Fischer is not afraid to tackle subjects once thought taboo. He gives a very believable portrayal of how a family might have dealt with religious and sexual conflicts during a time when such things were swept under the rug.<br />Although, the Black Eagle Inn is the final book in a fine trilogy, it certainly has legs to stand on its own. This was first of the three books I have read; I look forward to the other two.
B00ATSBIIG|2.0|I liked the free version, so I upgraded, but I'm not very happy. It stalls frequently, although if one waits it eventually reactivates itself.  I can't tell what the different levels are, and I have the impression that I keep doing puzzles at about the same level. I need to use the help provided, I guess.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of my favorite games. It's back! I am so VERY very very excited. Too many of my friends have passed me.<br /> I need to catch up!!!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great item and it works very well. Thanks for having this calculator. barb<br />Will tell all my friend about this.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|He seems to be a rear cross of 3 or 4 singers from the 70's and 80's. Takes a few plays,but you will enjoy Rodriquez.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|It's not flash. I'm not technically savi. So it's not working. I'm very disappointed. It stops me from viewing things.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|It has been fun to watch the documentary about Rodriquez on the Starz network. I believe it is called<br />Serching for Sugarman. Most all of his songs are played and it is a facinating story.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|One of the kids enjoy it but the other did not. It is good for their age. Very good game program
B00459EZLW|5.0|...and the episodes for this season got stronger and stronger throughout the season. Epilogue is an excellent episode.<br /><br />I thought this series ended too soon. It had fantastic talent not only in front of the camera, but behind it too.<br /><br />It was my favorite of the three SG series.<br /><br />It is good to see that the talent has gone on to other shows like Once Upon a Time, Longmire, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that are successful.<br /><br />I highly recommend SG:U for your viewing pleasure. It is great TV.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|Classic movie from my childhood. Has cool effects given the time it was made. Definitely a different perspective on Peter Pan and Captain Hook. My 5 year old, who watches &#34;Jake and the Neverland Pirates&#34;, easily followed the story and enjoyed the movie too.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Fantastic fun that is never impossible to be rewatched. Just the right of emotion, action, imagination, and comedy wrapped into a single bundle.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great book!  I am enjoying it and it is a real page turner.  You can not put it down.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|The whole album is good in general and much much better than the previous one<br />  Somewhat bad<br />Intro is good even though it reminds me of symphony x or nightwish themes...out of place maybe<br />4th song instrumental ...not good spoils the album<br />20 minute song not good. It is not that easy to make a long track without being boring. Just by adding riffs and melodies and boring pauses doesn't mean that you have a solid song. Unless you write a cliffhanger like SG, or an epic 30 min odyssey like Sx there is little hope. It subtracts from the album.<br />  The good<br />Much better than the previous album which i didn't like, better songs, easier even though I don 't know if that is good or not but I liked it. A bit more commercial but not in a bad way.<br />Great vocals....great improvement, different with wider range<br /> The bad<br />No matter how they try and no matter how i liked this album DT cannot be epic. I like they songs but they cant make feel that much... For example listen to the beginning of odyssey, or the gates of babylon or the ballad sacrifice , or when all is lost by symphony x and feel. This epic ness doesn't exist here. Good songs yes. Songs that make me wanna scream no!<br />On the other hand on terms of originality Haken's the mountain is a level up compared to this album. Way much progressive and difficult, but so much feeling and things to discover.<br />Finally if i compare it with nine by circus maximus i find nine better and more solid album as a whole.<br />So, fans of DT won't be disappointed. For me I hope that it stays in my cd car half the time i kept paradise lost and it will be worth its money.<br />--------------after many listenings<br />i really like this album. i don't think it will disappoint any  DT fans and it plays on my car's cd skipping only the 4th instrumental song while the previous album was boring and difficult, this is easier, lighter and has feeling. However, the drums no matter how technical and fantastic they are, sometimes they are too much and deduct from the whole feeling. Its not a classic album up there with burn the sun, or a shadow gallery album, or paradise lost. Its not better than haken's the mountain. But is good and solid like redemption's last album and its progressive that no many bands can create. So until SYMPHONY X makes a new album this is the best you re gonna get.ic they are, sometimes they are too much and deduct from the whole feeling.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game with a variety of challenges.  I like to challenge myself to beat my friends when connected to Facebook.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I was expecting that this would be some sort of continuation of storyline or at least related to the first movie. Apparently not - except for a few cameos by the stars of the first movie. Arnold & Sly really need to retire from acting. And they killed off the only good looking member of the cast.
B003U80I5G|4.0|Not as good as I expected for more famous actors but worth watching, but still a good rendition, costumes great.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|After seeing a video of the research that led to this diet, I purchased the book and put twice a week limited fasting to work.  The health reasons for this practice are more important than for losing weight although that is a benefit.  This practice is manageable and simple requiring minimal lifestyle change.  It reduces interior body fat, the kind that packs around your heart and liver and every other thoracic organs.  That's the fat that causes fat related diseases.  Men who have guts that look like they have a basketball under their shirts, as I did, look that way due to internal fat.<br />The practice (twice weekly 600 calories fast days) lowers BP, cholesterol, insulin resistance and other problems.  All of those have improved in the month and a half since I started.  I weight what I did 40 years ago and I eat normally on the other days of the week.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Good version, never heard of these actors but their portrayal was very good. More realistic than some of the other versions I have watched.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I recommend this product to anyone looking for a gaming headset.  Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!!  He even prefers to listen to music through them instead of his speakers.
B000244FDW|4.0|Good rendition, am collecting as many versions as I can for comparison to the book, this one was very good.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This is the worse \\"thriller\\" I have ever read.  The first half of the book is about 4 people in a car.  Then you get 90% of the plot laid out for you in one chapter.  Then the rest of the book is about running around and trying to save the day and finally...and you see this coming a mile away...the girl saves the guy.  It ends with a chapter of additional plot.  Absolute waste of time...give me a John Lyman novel any day!!
B005GRF2UK|4.0|Have 5 different versions of Jane Eyre all very well done, some closer to the book than others, very interesting.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|All of the cast was perfect for their roles.  The movie was very well done,  I would encourage anyone to watch it. Some of the situations are a little disturbing, but they had to be to make you understand the story.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|The computer graphics were amazing. The story line was in much greater depth then it showed in the trailers. I would watch it again
B008IGAJJK|4.0|Very irreverent silly and outrageous, and great acting.  I also love the sitcom spinoff.  If you haven't seen it, you should.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was not a Star Trek fan until the last two movies. Great addition to the Star Trek series. Watched it multiple times.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great.  Occasionally I have to manipulate the sound on the computer to get it to play on the TV, but all in all, this is a great little device for the cost.  Get one!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|The movie was boring and the computer graphics were not up to par. Not a movie that I would watch again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love  this game I can't get enough of it. I play this all the time. Was looking for a new game to play on my kindle and now I have one.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It was a great addition to the Iron Man saga and the action scenes were awesome. I loved that it kept on track with the Avengers movie.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I got totally engrossed in this book.  Harry Hole took us down to Australia and kept me on my toes the whole way.<br />Great characters.
B00F08ADX6|3.0|I bought this game for his superb art direction. I love it. but when you play it the frame rate is awful, it hurt the eyes! but despite that is a fun game. please this good game needs an upgrade fixing the frame rate
160774418X|5.0|One of the best cookbooks I have ever used.  Recipes are amazing and easy to follow.  Results are incredibly wonderful.
B000HTTMEE|5.0|I was talking to my granddaughter about this book. I'd had read it years earlier.<br />I decided to buy it for her. Great price
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is one of the few I've seen that have brilliance in both the writing, producing AND the acting. Tatiana Maslany is a genius actor as she plays different version of herself...sometimes playing different versions of herself. Since she plays clones of herself, of course. She deserves every award possible for what she accomplishes in this series. The logistics in writing and shooting a show where the main actress is having numerous conversations with other versions of herself must be quite the feat to produce and shoot, but this team does it exceptionally well.<br /><br />This series is exceptional on every level. To not watch it is a crime.
0345803485|3.0|This was a gift for someone. I didn't read it my self, not my genre.<br />The person loved it a lot.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. So beautifully written and interesting ever page, ever chapter. I think anyone would enjoy her story of her early days in NYC even those not familiar with her music. Excellent read.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|I needed this for a college project and found it difficult to find in the store.<br />It was necessary to analyze the characters and plot for this project. I had to watch it twice! I had gotten so involved in the plot that I stopped taking notes and had to watch it again. It was well worth the second viewing!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie and have seen this movie several times now. Good addition to my library!! A definite great buy!!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read as a student. I recommend this book to people because it was a very good book
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This is the first installment of the Hobbit Trilogy. I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the second movie in the trilogy coming out this December.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't put the book down. I don't like the fact that the next book is not written. I need an ending to the novels I read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great gadget - especially for $35. Would highly recommend to anyone who does not have WiFi enabled devise connected to their TV.<br /><br />Only complaint I have is that when I used the USB port as the source of power (on my Sharp Aquos TV), the pictures often got fuzzy.  It did not happen all the time, but it was annoying enough, that I used the provided power adapter instead.  Since then I have had no problems.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a great puzzler! It lets you interact with it so much! And the graphics are great! If you love puzzle games, this is the perfect thing for you!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Good flick. Just as good as the first one and the 3d was impressive. Money well spent. Hope Downey sticks with the character.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh god. This book will never leave me, will it?it's brilliant and it got me so emotional, I don't know if it's because I can relate a bit or what it is.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I so enjoyed the multiple stories within another story. The connectedness of the individuals to the family, to the<br />Community, to the country to the world but eventually to within the soul. Intriguingly beautiful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love love love candy crush saga, I am so glad I can play it on my kindle now!  Fun game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyable game, somewhat challenging especially with each level. Ready for more rooms to be added so I can continue to play.
B002K9C0Q6|4.0|10-29-2013  I never actually studcied genetics while in I&#62;U&#62; School of medecine, but I know the reality of inheritance when I see it, or hea it.  I think this cd beas this out nicely.  Paavo Jarviis a &#34;kid&#34; with considerable talentand it doesn't hurt to have Nemie Jarvi for a father.  I have 6-12 recordings by this dynamic young maestro but, oddly enough, not a one by Papa, and that's just the way my record collectiong has gone.  I haven't heard or read about anythng spetacularr regarding the senior Jarvi to make me race to the nearest record store, but starting with the Sibelius 2nd symphony and the glowing reviews it got, I started with thatexxcellent Telarcrelease and just went on from there.  &#34;Junior&#34; has given us a powerful and massive 2nd Symphony and this bruckner 9th is not far from the grandness of that earlie effort.  Recorde live in November 27, 29th of 2008 in Frnkfurt this frankfurt Radio Sym Orch plays this veldadictorian  and Autumnal Epic soundscape in 65:39, or a good 5 minutes morre than the competitin,and, indeed he HAS some competition.  I own 9ths from, colti, and  Barenboim, both with Chicago.  I also have Karajan, Jochum ( Dresden and Berlin) and Tintner, Inbal and, of course, a 9th by the great brucknerian, Gunther Wand.  What all these recordings have in common is their adherance to the epic lyout of the &#34;grand&#34; symphony, grand in the trdition of Beethoven and Mahler.  Size DOES matter and since the composer was rthinking along epic lines we get epic  treatments.<br /><br />  The opening movement runsa grand and opulent 27:41 and feelseverybit the sgrandcutain raiserit was intended to be.  Bruckner's farewell tothe wlorld will notbe ameek afir,but a grand and thunderous god praising climax.Bruckner also thought he wouldlive tocompleteit,but changedit  his mind as his heart healthworseened, probably Coronary congestive heart failure, a miserable condition with ll the symptomsof  decreasing cardiac performance along with an inability of the cardio-pulmoary complex to evacuate the fluids from the body, thus the patient feels he is drowning to death.  Edema builds in the distall areas of the body,swelling hands feet and movement and energy levels weaken severely.  In Bruckne'sday,it was called &#34;Dropsy.&#34;  Bruckner,made the decision,during the middle his writing of the 9th to place the adaagio in the 3rd position, so that if the composer was too weak to finish the symphony, he wanted a long and beautiful adagio to be his last completed movement. It was, and it'sbeautyand poinniancy , to this day,take my breath away.  Jarvi opens the Adagio with huge, powerfful gestures and the frankfurt radio responds with a glowing and splenderous tone.  The recording venue, the Alte Opera housein frankfurtt is , I suspect a large and cavernous location, but there isn't too much reverberance.  What it does have is a sense of a wide open space,like a celestial kingdom.  Bruckner fills this space with warmth,might and zealous devotion through his use of the orchesral, embellished, asit is, by the addition of aquarttet of Wagner Tubas.  I've often wondered how the composer's 5th sssSymphony would have sounded with these additional instruments.  I think gloriousin this, the 5th, his 1st &#34;big&#34; symphony,<br /><br />  This Jarvi 9th is on the SONY label and they should be proud.  It is a SACD releaseand along with the fine, but less impressive 7th,I eagerly await the 8th, hopefullyinMr. Jarvi's plans and, perhaps the rest of the works in the form of a cycle.  Do we &#34;need&#34; another Bruckner cycle?  No,not eally, then this young and perhapsbrilliant conductor has Bruckner in his system pehaps in his blood..Time will tell, and I for one, WOULD takea chance on Paavo ,  Go for it!!!<br /><br />  An eloquent and gorgeous 9th, worthy of repeatedhearings both through headphones and out of a surround sound galleryof speakers.  Enjoy this well recommended 5.0 STAR cd,<br /><br />  Bestwishes, Tony.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son can't get enough of this.  If I would let him he would play it non-stop all day every day.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like the game and think it is cool and I like to hunt the dear, wolves, and ducks. I also like to shoot stuff
B0089LOG02|3.0|This story line changes back and forth between one young life in theist and a more current life to show comparison of how to people in different generations found common ground and a friendship. It was a little bit of a slow read, but it was interesting and entertaining.  This was my first book reflecting on the orphan train topic. This has lead me to want to learn more about the orphan train experiences.  Vivian (Dorothy, Niev) had an interesting 92 years and sheds light on experiences that very small children may have gone thru in a very early time in their lives. The hardness that those children learned and the love they grew to find in some cases.  I would recommend for a rainy day read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that this game is awesome and that everybody should have this game because it keeps your mind going on. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
0529064847|5.0|Very satisfied with the purchase that I made and would highly recommend to anyone else in need to some spiritual guidance or to utilize for their religion class(s) which is the reason for my purchase..
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Surprisingly well made mindless action film - very interesting and clever use of slow motion<br />Some clever dialogue and concepts that take film beyond the ususal of this type
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is awesome. Though I have seen the movie many years ago, it holds no candles to the book. Very good read can't wait to read the next book by Steven King.
B008Y212PI|5.0|challenging in higher levels but doable.  the graphics are simple and nice.  i find this to be a great way to unwind.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great game, can't wait for the next one! Graphics are top notch, especially for my kindle. I hope the new one comes out soon
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are well developed. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns. The story lines are faithful to history and Downton Abby is much more then a magnificent building, it's a leading &#34;character &#34;.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Kenny did something  different , put something with Stephen stills was very good both very good musician  liked it a lot
006202406X|2.0|I wanted to give this one and one-half stars. I'm still reeling from this book. Having devoured the first two, I couldn't wait for #3, along with the rest of the world. Such a disappointment! It was poorly written, contrived, and didn't seem in sync with the first two. I think her publisher must have been rushing her. This COULD have been a fantastic story, alas. There were many inconsistencies throughout. As for the ending? Such a copout. When the author is more mature, I believe she will look back and regret her choices in wrapping up this tale. Readers want to be entertained, to be entranced, NOT to be pushed over a cliff, going \\"ouch ouch ouch\\" all the way down. I'm not sure I can trust Ms. Roth enough to read her future books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my third time reading this book, and it still gets to me. I love it. I can't wait for the movie!!
B00DW1WR14|3.0|If you recall the intensity of the performance that first garnered Eddie Vedder so much attention upon the release of Ten, you'll only have to watch him now to know what's missing from PJ 20 years later. On one hand you might say holding that would be a far stretch two decades later, but I present artist from Elvis & The Beatles to Metallica and the Rolling Stones as argument that growing and become more fierce with age is possible.<br /><br />Lightning Bolt kicks off with 10 minutes of solid PJ rockers that recall the freedom and immediacy of Go & Spin the Black Circle. Then the unspeakable happens, arena rock, the great, big, should never have happened Sirens. I'm not sure why we should be impressed that they can pull off a Journey style power ballad thirty years later, but we shouldn't be.<br /><br />We get one more burst of energy, the should-have-tweaked-the-chorus title song which aims but never fires, it's just \\"ok\\".<br /><br />Then the album pulls over and gets out of the car and walks home, dragging it's feet. Sure, Let the Records Play is a do-whap beat with a throw back message, a solid B side. The other songs are purely devoid of energy, phone-in mini opus's that seem to just blend together and drag on until the CD repeats and the three really good songs play again. Why we would re-do \\"Sleeping By Myself\\"is confusing, but Swallowed Whole sounds like a through-away from the superior \\"into the wild\\" soundtrack. Yes, the final 7 songs are all passible and one or two of them on any PJ record would be ok, but these songs aren't Black, Release, Indifference, Immortality or The End. The lack the passion and all grouped together they collectively sink the ship.<br /><br />It's also worth noting the slick, polished sound. Takes all the life write out of the music. Every since Yield the production on PJ records (other than the self-titled one) has been a dreary wash of radio-friendly clean and crisp. It's like they try so hard to live up to the expectations they perceive us to have of them that they fall even shorter for it.<br /><br />PJ, is a great band, but they show the ease in which they write, especially considering this was done in two quick sessions a year apart. EV says they aim to put out the best record, period, shame they didn't try to write it first. I think the worse thing is that we all know they could do this record in their sleep, which is why I wish they'd wake up.erceive us to have of them that they fall even shorter for it.<br /><br />PJ, is a great band, but they show the ease in which they write, especially considering this was done in two quick sessions a year apart.

B00ENYKBD0|3.0|This film was recommended by a friend as I was struggling with some issues (NOT schizophrenia).  She felt the moral was about putting your energy where you will benefit the most.  I didn't actually take that message away until I looked up the real John Nash and read about his life, which is quite remarkable.  I thought the first part of the film was a bit slow and the second half a bit hard to swallow.  Although I blame this in part from what I considered to be over-acting.  At moments, Russell Crowe was brilliant, at other times, I simply saw Russell Crowe acting.  His wife (can't remember her name) was beautiful and brilliant and acted the part marvelousy, until the very end, when the make-up artists brought one back again to the fact that these are actors, NOT real people, as you want to believe when watching a film.  One additional point, I have a sister-in-law who I have known for over 40 years, since she was a pre-teen, who has suffered from severe schizophrenia.  This is a severe and frightening disease.  People who have it must take medication.  The fact that the real John Nash had an extraordinary mind may have allowed him to quit taking his meds.  This is extrememly dangerous for most people with this illness and their families.  His decision should not be glorified.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I really should have paced myself, but I just couldn't stop reading. Allie Brosh's writing is just as delightful in book form as she is on the internet. The book is much longer than I was expecting, with far more new material. The quality is just lovely--glossy paper, bright colors. If you've never read Hyperbole and a Half before, you are in for a treat: brilliant comedic timing, gut-wrenching honesty, and the ability to bring the dullest events alive with deceptively simple illustrations. Her chapters on depression are some of the richest I've ever read. She has an astonishing ability to rip your heart open and make you laugh while she's doing it.<br /><br />You will laugh out loud when you read this. Possibly to the point of breathlessness, or slight pants-wetting, certainly to the point of getting yourself in trouble at work or school if try to read it when you should be doing something more productive. So take a sick day, go potty, take a deep breath and jump right into Allie's world. You will not regret it.

B002X9GX4S|5.0|I just got into Alesana a couple months ago, and this is definitely the album to have by them. It's absolutely fantastic! I bought a used copy, so there were some tears in the case, but that was perfectly fine and they had it labeled that way when I purchased it. The CD wasn't scratched either.<br />I ordered this album and received it three days later, only purchasing standard shipping! It was great doing business with them, and I will most likely order from them again!

B004GHNIRK|3.0|I found the writing very long winded. The character development could of been shorter for a modern reader. The story is still compelling,
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Love the character growth throughout Sandersons books, as well as the detailed background of the world they live in. Can't wait for the next in this series!
B005IS565S|5.0|Great music, great cd. I love that it comes with the digital download as well, it saves me from having to rip it to my computer.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I am a Baz Luhrman fan and I enjoyed some aspect of this movie although at times it got away from me. I can certainly see why a number of people just gave up on.<br /><br />Basically the is too much fluff and tinsel and not enough substance to keep one engaged. My wife stuck with it but I went to bed...
B002ZG975Q|2.0|After watching previews I was psyched to watch this movie, and it was a decent movie but it wasn't a favorite. It had too little character development and lacked in the story line.
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|So , having seen Frankenstein in films and parodies, I decided to finally go to the source. I enjoyed it for reasons I hadn't expected, understand why it's a classic,and look forward to rereading it in the future.
159463176X|2.0|This book was a huge let down compared to his last two, \\"The kite runner\\" and \\"A thousand splendid suns\\". I begged my Husband to buy this one for me once it was released and was disappointed. It started off great then slowly got boring. There were to many characters and it continued to switch back and forth it was hard to follow and several months later I finally finished it because I felt guilty my Husband spent money on it! I rented his other two from the Library luckily however those were Excellent! I highly recommended \\"The kite runner\\" and \\"A thousand splendid suns\\". But as for \\"And the mountains echoed\\" this one was his dud. If you must read it I highly recommend you rent this one from your local library, Don't spend a dime on this dud like we did. :(

B00FOWX6NM|3.0|this is my second Ultra Hybrid ...<br />had bought the BLACK one when it was just launched<br />now am back hoping the Cafe Brown MATCHES my GOLD 5S<br />bummer, doesn't even come close to what's shown in pic (lose a STAR for that ... had contemplated 2 stars but tot otherwise)<br /><br />luckily for me, mine came with the plastic wrap intact<br />cosmetic wise, i expected better from a brand like Spigen!<br />bottom left corner ... a pork mark, opposite side of volume buttons ... an excess layer of bumper material visible!<br /><br />have always been a fan of PowerSupport Air Jacket ...<br />but have had enuff of the headache of removing it on travels (exchange SIM card with destination's country prepaid card)<br />so opted for a bumper ... and this Ultra Hybrid makes removal and installation a breeze<br />also bcos it's TPU, lesser or no risk of resultant scratches<br /><br />i also like that the bottom areas are compartmentalize ...<br />and that the Volume buttons and Power button are protected by the bumper ...<br /><br />after all that's been said abt the color ...<br />this Cafe Brown is definitely a better compliment with a GOLD iPhone than the BLACK one<br /><br />Verdict :<br />3.5 STARS !<br />would have been a 4 had mine not had cosmetic issues !<br />and a 5 IF it'd only (i) looks as advertised color wise OR (ii) the advertised image (color) looks like the product itself!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like it so do my kids. it is easy and colorful the music is soothing also I like that you can earn pearl's
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I truely enjoyed this movie, the acting of Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith were both excellent- the script for the movie was full of emotional scenes and family.  both were full of facts and human falures as well as acomplishments- and the ending was suspenseful but ended great- i dont cry much at watching movies there was 2 scenes in the movie that i cried at, not because of anguish but crying from truely great love of a creature other than mankind- i recommend everyone to check out this movie and pay close attention to the small details that make a movie really great- i rate it actually more than the 5 stars available.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|If you like zombie movies then its worth renting it. I liked the immediate action and quick, simple story line.

0316204366|3.0|Like all Gladwell books, this is a very well written book and it is a quick read.  So I can't say it is a 'bad' book because it held my interest and I enjoyed certain parts of it.<br /><br />However, as a whole, the book is an example of creating a thesis and desperately trying to find examples to prove said thesis.  He starts from the premise that disadvantages can actually be advantages and then provides a series of examples to prove this.  For example, we learn about David Boises and Gary Cohn, two very successful people who have dyslexia.  Of course, we don't hear about the millions of people who have dyslexia who aren't successful.  Gladwell's argument is basically akin to pointing to Michael Dell and saying, \\"look, he dropped out of college and got rich.....so you should drop out of college too!\\"  It is silly and stupid.<br /><br />The book really goes off track in the end, especially the final chapter when he discusses a person in Vichy France who hid Jews from the Nazis.  Gladwell idiotically states something to the effect of, 'you see, it's not easy to wipe out villages; people will fight back.'  Well, actually, Malcolm, this isn't actually true as evidenced by the six million Jews who died during that time.  He is reaching non-stop in this book.  In sum, I think Gladwell peaked with 'Blink' and it has been downhill ever since.

B00D41H2PS|3.0|Figure out what happened to the people who disappeared from a small town where a man was experimenting with a time machine (again?)<br /><br />Gameplay wise if you played The Mystery of the Dream Box you already know how it works.  Even the interface is carried over from Dream Box.  At least the controls were a bit better than Dream Box.<br /><br />A lot of the visuals and music were lifted from Dream Box.  I consider that an unfortunate but necessary deal since I don't believe Magic Frame Studios is a very big developer with enough resources to make a variety of music.<br /><br />The story is more fleshed out than Dream Box.  There is an epilogue and conclusion (unlike Dream Box).  However it doesn't do a very good job of explaining just what happened to the townspeople.  They don't say whether there were any repercussions to the man who tried the time machine experiment in the first place (despite warnings not to).  This is just the writer in me but I would like to see the story fleshed out just a little bit more.<br /><br />However you may feel about The Mystery of Dream Box, Lost Town won't do anything to change your mind one way or another.  You can see some progress but Magic Frame Studios still has some ways to go before they create the next Myst or Mystery Case Files.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|Devil Driver is Awesome & Better than Ever! I Love this Album, these guys jam down hard. Dvd is great also.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Getting three incredible musicians together to make music doesn't always mean good song writing.  The Winery Dogs make it happen.  They pull it off live without a problem also.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Got this for my 11 year old.  She loves it and it was a good challenge.  Would love to get the rest of the set, but you know that lego isn't cheap.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a long movie presented in episode format.  The acting, directing, story, and sets are all first rate.  Don't miss it.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|This is a great CD. I immediately put it on my iphone and listen to it in the car. It's a little bit different for Elvis, which is great.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this book.  Mr. Grisham didn't disapppoint.  Living in the desert southwest, I enjoyed the setting of the Old South and glimpses into its culture.  Let's home there are more &#34;Jake&#34; novels.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just finished reading this, without having read The Shining first.  It stands alone as another great novel by Stephen King, that keeps you running to the next page.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Our little niece comes and uses my Kindle all the time and she just loves the overal action in this.  Keeps here entertained for hours.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not too easy but not so hard that you give up. I refuse to pay to play so you only get a few lifes before you run out and then have to wait a few minutes before you can continue play.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I absolutely love this keyboard, but it needs Chinese! I've tried just switching keyboards but then I miss how easy it is to write in English! It really is the best keyboard I've encountered and willingly recommend it to people that want to cut down on their typing time and increase their accuracy
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|A complex tale of a true warrior, who despite all the war atrocities and horrors that come with these environs, we strip away the layers and reveal a real human with real feelings and emotions.<br />Thank you Chris, for your service. Thank you for also being willing to show compassion, pain, ethos, and love for God, country, and most importantly, family and humanity.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars<br />By John Green<br /><br />I seldom read straight literary fiction.  I used to, but then life got complicated, and I wanted my reading to be of a strictly entertaining nature, so I gravitate toward mystery, adventure, fantasy, a little sci-fi.  My days of reading tomes such as Dear and Glorious Physician are far behind me.  So, I would have usually ignored a book like John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars -- much too serious a subject matter for me.  Not the sort of interesting, but not necessarily realistic, reading I’m drawn to.  But the author is one-half of the fascinating vlogbrothers duo ([...] two brothers who make not only entertaining and fun video blogs, but who also approach big issues with a clear and honest touch.  And, he’s an Indiana author, and I love becoming familiar with the work of authors from my home state.  So when my friends started recommending that I pick up a copy of this book, I was very willing to veer away from my usual reading choices for a while.<br /><br />The book is exquisite in every way that word can be used.  The writing style is seamless, elegant, yet believable as the first person narrative of a teenage girl living Hazel Green’s complicated life.  The pain of Hazel, her parents, and her friends, is so real, so gripping, that it is physically disturbing to the reader.  Still, her joy, her humor, her unfailing curiosity and enthusiasm about the life she’s been dealt, shines through.  Hazel is every girl, yet a special girl, too.  Her friends are ordinary teenagers living extraordinary lives, dealing with issues most of us, after multiple decades on this earth, have been lucky enough to escape.<br /><br />I simply couldn’t put the book down.  I would sit down to read for an hour, and two hours later would have to force myself to stop reading in order to get ready to go to the classes I teach.  I’d take the book along when I went to meet friends for lunch or dinner, then would be almost disappointed when they showed up on time, because it meant I wouldn’t be able to steal an extra few minutes with the story.  Yes, I basically knew that things would not end well for Hazel and her friends.  The ending was much less important than the journey.<br /><br />Green does a bang up job of showing the development of the relationships in the book.  Obviously, the relationship between Hazel and Augustus is prime, but their relationship with Isaac plays an essential part in showing the depth of connection between these three teenagers, all suffering from one variety or another of childhood cancer.<br /><br />It’s difficult to review a book like this.  I could say I didn’t notice one misspelling, one grammatical misstep, one flaw in the plotting or characterizations.  Nada.  Perfectly written, perfectly edited, perfectly proofed.<br /><br />It’s not particularly an easy book to love, but love it you will.  I highly recommend it.  But if you decide to read it, be prepared to have your heart broken.
B00BRUPICM|1.0|Beginning with a kidnapping of a lovely young woman,<br />things just get worse and more brutal as you go along.<br />By the time you come to the end, the brutality is stomach-churning awful.<br />The outline of the detective story is very good if the author had<br />just dialed back the gore.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Downtown Abbey is well produced and acted if you like the soap opera type show. I'm sure others would like it, but it wasn't for me.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very engaging story right from the beginning. Also, a fast read. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction.
B005VT42BS|5.0|AutoDiscovery is wonderful.  I have a lot of systems that run under a bridged network so they have two IP addresses and this displays both interfaces on one device.  Wonderful tool.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Calculator plus is a good app that make math calculations easier.  I would definitely recommend this app for another that takes college math.
0399255370|5.0|This book was read to my fourth grader's class. It's a really creative book filled with gorgeous and silly illustrations. The book is about a box of crayons who go on strike because their owner doesn't use them they way they want to be used. It's fun and silly. My daughter begged me to buy this book and it inspired her to write her own version and illustrate it using all of the colors in her crayon box.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game. It is challenging, but fun. I don't like the limited number of lives, even to play previous levels.
B008EL25LE|5.0|The more you play the more you want to advance to the next step, just cann't put it down... great back ground music
B00C5R8364|5.0|well written - Forsyth is always a good tale master - actual stories, hand in hand with Captain Phylips true story
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Very fast RSS reader and it is quick to mark all as red to keep up on latest news coming in.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Cubetris - A Block Puzzle Tangram Game is a very addicting and challenging game.  The app was free when I downloaded it.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Good movie. Not one I would watch over and over again, but a good movie none the less. Definitely worth the rental
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the first 3 seasons...one episode every night on my iPad...and I couldn't wait to go to bed to watch the next one.  Maggie Smith is incredible, but the whole cast is great.  Can't wait for the next season to start.  Thank you Amazon Prime!
B00EKJWS1Q|2.0|The only advantage this app has over my standard android browser is I can see the subfolders I created within my inbox. However, every time you fire this up, an ad in the form of a message box appears which got annoying fast!<br /><br />I uninstalled it about 12 hours after I downloaded it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very helpful to me and user friendly is what I always look for.  Very reasonable pricing.  Plan to use it often.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great (crazy) book that kept me engaged from the very beginning with its twists and turns. Wish it ended differently but all in all a great read!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|ZDefense is a very addicting and challenging.  The app was free when I downloaded it.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|Can't wait to see what their future brings!  Such raw talent is a rarity and it's great when they can showcase it and share their music with the world!
B007L5LD9O|1.0|Boring... It just was not the type of movie we thought it might be from reading the description. Wasn't funny enough, or fast moving enoung.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|She loves it! We watched the movie with her and she fell in love with Gizmo. The song it sings is pretty cool. Very cute.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|One of the best musical ever. Great songs, great cast and then some.<br />Innocents at its best. We should have more of these today.
006202406X|1.0|Let's just say it took me a lot longer to finish this book because I got bored. It was more like I have to finish it now because I want to know how it ends. I was very disappointed. People have made good points about why she killed off Tris but I don't care. You don't kill the main character. It's lame.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush  is very addicting and challenging.  The app was free when I downloaded it.  Most of these free movie themed games are no good, but this one is a hit.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Needs to be an Xbox game, but then I wouldn't get anything done.  It keeps me waiting for more lives.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Awesome book! This is a very intense and hopeless story. I could not put the book down. I read it in three days. Even though its fiction, this book did a good job portraying the sad and unbearable lives of slaves in that time. This book was full of tragedy. It was one thing after another.<br /><br />A couple of aspects separated this book from other similar books I've read:<br />-I enjoyed reading the differences between the lives of the slaves who were owned for life versus Lavinia who could possibly be \\"set free\\" after her time was served. This was a creative angle to the book.<br />- The author's decision to mainly focus on slaves who lived in \\"the big house\\". They were very aware of how better off they were and frequently felt guilty about it.<br /><br />One thing I didn't care for was the abundance of characters I had to keep up with. Sometimes I had to remind myself who they were.<br /><br />Lastly, Belle and Lavinia were aggravating me by the end of the book because I knew the tragedy that lied ahead ( I wish the author did NOT include the prologue!). However, I can't judge them because I definitely could not walk one centimeter in their shoes.<br /><br />Great book! Now I have no clue what to read next because I know it won't compare to this book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I downloaded this book thinking I would put it on the long list of books on my Kindle but after reading the first chapter I was hooked!  It was heartwarming and sad and parts of it actually made me cry.  So great!!!!!!
0307341577|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. Gillian Flynn does a fantastic job with her writing, leaving you teetering on the edge then pulls the rug out from under your feet. Her story here is twisted, evil and sad. In some ways, this story is a tad predictable and stereotypical, but the mystery, the characters and how Flynn pieces everything together in the end is phenomenal! Dark Places won't leave you disappointed, at all!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game, to me it's like reading a good book at times I just can't put it down. But I do limit my play to just an hour
B007AL48UK|5.0|Summer Mahjong is very addicting and challenging.  The app was free when I downloaded it.  I would definitely recommend this app.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Not as good as Divinci code or angels and demons, but still good. He certainly knows his way around Italy. Everywhere he goes you can almost visualize what the places look like in your head because he is so detailed. Otta be a travel guide.<br />Anyway, a good read. Enjoyed it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show. It is very witty and intelligent. Love all the characters. The style and clothing is fun as well.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Kept me reading way past my lights out time. This puls 11/22/63 have brought me back to the King fold.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|A very funny movie, it has you rolling with laughter throughout. A new favorite.  This movie flips stereotypes on their head.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a good show. I do find it typical of the lawyer courtroom drama shows.<br />I've not spent much time in real court rooms so I don't really know what is just tv drama and how much is true life lessons in the study of the law. Having said that, I will add I found this season entertaining.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|very nice how much this is the best thing in the web just watch whenever you want and pay so lessss
B004XZR63M|2.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad was one of my first personal finance books I ever read and it really got me into investing and reading a bunch of books on personal finance and investing. So, I credit it for the inspiration to really get into creating personal wealth. However, beyond that the book only offers generic advice that is offered in most books, some interesting perspectives on assets (which can help a little if you don't know anything about assets vs. liabilities, but otherwise is pretty pointless), and most importantly - Rich Dad, Poor Dad suggests some really sketchy, borderline illegal real estate methods. Check out this site for more analysis of the book: [...]
B00005BGV2|5.0|this album was amazing on CD, but having it on vinyl was ten times better. the sound quality was amazing, not to mention the discs were gorgeous. If you're obsessed with vinyl, you have to add this to your collection. Its mind-blowing.
B00F880BWG|3.0|This show has lost it's Walking Dead spunk.  I don't really have an interest of watching any more shows! It is nice Amazon has current shows to watch when you don't have cable.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|When I can't fall asleep the app helps me so much  and I'm only 9 when you have someone yelling or screaming it helps me. the next day I woke up when I used this app I felt amazing
B002EXEGTW|5.0|We watched this with our teenagers who LOVED it!  The blending of a historical event with a gripping story-telling made it very enjoyable and had the whole family on the edge of our seats (again).  My wife and I first watched this when it came out on IMAX.  Just as exciting watching it a second time around.  Really like that it focuses on the storyline and doesn't try to introduce the negative influences (sex, drugs, violence) that so many movies use to try and capture audience.  Highly recommended!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|It was more than I expected :D The cover was so sparky ,I didn`t expected that!And the quality is perfect! Thaaank you!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love it never play a game likes.I say if you do not have it go get it.I let u see for ur self.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun! No issues woth it on Samsung Galaxy SIII. My kids always want my phone so they can play
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Movie was an ok movie to watch one time.  In my opinion it was simply a different version of I am legend. :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. I am so glad that you can now get it on Kindle. Cannot wait for Pet Rescue and Farm Saga to come out on the Kindle also...This game does not require internet although you can connect to facebook if you are so inclined.  I love the fact that you don't have to connect to play it.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|I found this movie to be disturbing yet in the end it proved that people's humanity always triumphs.  Held my interest all the way through.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This novel is simply fantastic.  The story, the characters, the dialogue, the twists -- all delicious.  I have not enjoyed a new author, or any author, so thoroughly in many years.  It's the kind of book where you finish it and sit there grinning and thinking, &#34;Wow!&#34;  One thing's for sure, I cannot WAIT for the other two books of the trilogy, and more by Lemaitre.  By the way, I was leery of reading a translated book, after recently trying to read the Italian translation of &#34;I am God.&#34;  But no, the translation is absolute perfection.  Enjoy!
0345530578|5.0|This is one of my top Grisham books.  I had not heard of it until about 3 weeks ago.  I pretty much read all his books.<br /><br />The interesting thing is this is slightly different than his other books. Can't really tell you why, but it is still a fun read!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check it almost every morning. Love the by the hour feature. I use it to better plan my errands around storms.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Most Daft Punk albums are long, repetitive, and drag on too long. Their songs are amazing, but are designed for live mixing at concerts. Random Access Memories feels more like individual tracks with a purpose as opposed to a groovy beat that can be applied to something. The album has a lot of funk/disco, but its fantastic.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Robin Williams cuts loose again - both very funny and heart warming - a must see for Peter Pan and/or Robin Williams fans - Dustin Hoffman as Hook is a welcome added talent
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The only superhero movie I have watched is Thor but I enjoyed it so I thought I'd try this.  It had a good mix of tongue in cheek humor and action.  I think I'll watch Iron Man after watching this movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really fun and easy to play. The three minigames and one bonus game to level the ponies are entertaining and simple to figure out! The graphics are adorable and the voice acting is good. I have seen some people complain about the gem system. The solution is easy: buy the ponyville theater. You can watch videos and get unlimited gems. I used this method  on my kindlefire doing this. The game does crash from time to time, but otherwise I highly rec it.
1476727651|5.0|Really liked this sequel, it kept me intrested and involved until the end. Mr. King has hit a home run with Dr. Sleep.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In all honesty this was a well written book. And i would highly recommend this.<br />Check out my Power Point on this book.[...]
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game moves quickly.  It is very easy to learn. It is very colorful.  I would recommend it for all.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I loved it allllll, the action, how the story line panned out, the only part I didn't like was how (SPOILER ALERT) Razim died, he melted like a snail in salt, by getting crushed by salt. Just gives me the creeps
B001FB563E|5.0|Such a grood movie. If you're into a father/son drama with a ton of suspence you will really like this movie. Or if you're into post-apocalyptic movies, this is one to see.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I've given it a little bit of a chance, but I don't see what all the excitement is about. Not particularly fun or challenging, just another way to waste time.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Fantastic story. The scenery is just amazing - from the \\"slums\\" to the \\"castles\\". I didn't find myself skimming much over unimportant details and the plot and action always moved along at a good clip. There are things I didn't like about some of the character developement, particularly how Locke is already a criminal mastermind at 6 years old and I might have liked some of the other characters to be developed a bit more. Also, some of the reactions of the characters didn't seem very believable (usually when they were being \\"too good\\" or doing what they were told without enough questioning or resistance). Neither really kept me from enjoying the book, though. All in all a great read. I kept coming back to it and read it for hours each day, so I would recommend it...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ive been. waiting to c what the hype was about this game is... now I c. I'm hooked...when I stop playing I cant wait to get back to it...  my kind of game... seems lime it never ends ... cant wait to c what's next ...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />Update!! I will be purchasing one of these for each room. Pandora Radio is also available and it sounds amazing through the TV.<br />1) The COST!!! What electronic device costs less than $40?? This one!<br />2)Excellent Quality and uninterrupted playback , even if your phone dies and s***s down, this player will continue playing over your wifi.<br />3) 1.2.3. installation.<br /><br />Cons<br />1) Not blue tooth compatible<br />2) You can only use it for netflix and you. I don't have netflix, so , I use it for youtube only.<br />3) You cannot use it to view pics, videos and other media from your phone<br />3) Strictly for youtube<br /><br />With so many cos, how could you give it 5 stars? \\" this thing cost $35. thats cheaper than a good memory card. If it was called youtube-only-caster.... I would have brought it and had zero complaints.<br /><br />Youtube is the new Free Tv, I will be purchasing one of these for each room.<br /><br />Jesus is coming. Repent. Peace.
B002M9WW30|5.0|among the best sports movies ever made. You can easily watch these over and over again as the acting was incredible and the fight scenes so exciting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|(Un?)Fortunately finally we have our crazy addiction available on every device....the HOURS devoted to the little candies....how am I ever going to find the time to move?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book haunted and teased me with the turning of each page.  I wanted to devour,yet savor each moment.  Every word and phrase was masterfully chosen to create a scene, a character, an emotion that you ponder and gnaw on long after it is read.  Thank you for engaging me so intensely into a story that rattled all of my senses and left me wanting more.
B008M4HB1W|5.0|Also very cheap (in price) so I highly recommend this collection of the Queen. I will say if you are looking at this product thinking you'll get jewel cases with the albums think again they are just sleeves holding the discs with the appropriate artwork on each. I don't see that as a complaint though as it comes with a case to hold all the sleeves. Good buy!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I couldn't stop! This was so well written and the entire series was so good. The story between Lena and Hana was my favorite.
0061733199|5.0|I bought this book thinking bear grills can only show me so much haha. It does have so much info bad part is that it has some info id probably never use like being stuck in russia what plants to eat . I live in cali.
B00013F38K|5.0|A really great older series with incredible acting and action to draw you in. Bought as a gift for a fan of the show. Should really consider buying this as you will enjoy for many years to come.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Our family from 2 to 50 love Shaun the Sheep. It is funny on lots of levels without being too adult. The humor is not mean or naughty. Just fun comedies of error on the farm.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I bought these a few months ago. They are great for keeping the spoon/spatula from touching the counter. Easy to clean and the nonstick has held up well. I would recommend them.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Although special effects were good ,this movie was reminiscent of the old Godzilla movies. There was little character development which made it impossible to care what happened to these characters.  No care ,no tension ,equals tedious.
B00FAOK0Y2|3.0|There were so many positive reviews on this cover that I thought it must be just what I was looking for! This product CANNOT be functional for what you need it for unless the phone can be quickly and easily accessed.  Unfortunately, when I put my 5s into it, I couldn't get it out.  The pull tab didn't move it out enough, and the thing was so tight that it took me 5 minutes to get my phone out of there and in so doing, many buttons were inadvertently pushed!  And I was afraid I was going to break it.  I was about ready to cut through the case to retrieve my phone.  Maybe it's a QA issue, but unless mine was an outlier (which the many negative reviews tell me it is not), I wouldn't bother with this one.  Note to self: READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU WANT IT!!! It is a pretty color, though :(<br /><br />  UPDATE AND ADDITIONAL NOTE: I was contacted by the Snugg folks after this review was published, and they offered to send me another to try, although I had already returned my initial case for a refund.  I received this replacement today, and it does, indeed, fit my iphone 5s very well, and the pull tab works quite smoothly to raise the phone for access.  This time, they included a card which says \\"as this is for a new Apple product, some changes may have taken place since our case went into production\\" and requesting that they be contacted directly for an immediate exchange if there is any problem.  I'm very pleased to report this and to note that the case works very well to protect the phone in pocket or purse and appears well made, and - now - fits the phone well. I therefore upgraded from a 1 star to a 3 star in my edited review.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I had faith in this device from the beginning. I actually set up my house in anticipation of the device coming and working, having my tv set up with no cables running to it at all in hopes of having everything run through chromecast. My router is a new AC router with 800mb/s throughput,  a very high end home built gaming computer, and internet is 30+mb/s. There is no bottleneck causing my issues with this device. To make this clear I have never given any product 1 star before and hope I never do again. When attempting to use youtube the chromecast will fail to move from one video to the next in the queue and after the first video you watch it is no longer usable until you reset it. The feature that works best is casting from my desktop files from my computer.That isn't to say it works properly, but at least you can watch about 20 minutes of video or so before the chromecast breakdown. Casting videos from amazon prime or hulu dont work at all. In response to this device I am now going to run HDMI through some pretty inconvenient places to my new TV because it isn't moving after I have remodeled. Please wait for version 2.0, at least maybe a 5.0 GHz model that can do double the throughput and maybe stream HD. I'd pay 200$ for a device that worked as advertised.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game for even adults to play.I got stuck on one level for like three days and was so excited when I finally got it.now I am awaiting more levels to be available so I can continue.I recommend this to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game really cool and gives you a good feel on what you do with horses it  really addicting keep it up
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Gotta love the guys at Google.  Think of this as a USB Thumb Drive only as an HDMI device.  You plug this into an HDMI port on your TV and plug in it's power cable (which is a mini-usb port).  Then, the device creates an ad-hoc wifi network that you connect to either with your laptop/mobile device.  The Chromecast app on your laptop/mobile then automatically detects the widget and allows you to connect it to your preferred wifi network.  Once that is complete, all of the devices on the network see the Chromecast and can control it.<br /><br />Watch Netflix, Hulu, Google Music, Google Video, or stream a Chrome browser tab to your TV.  Super slick, easy, small, etc.<br /><br />I love using it in hotels, though that setup is a bit more complex as I travel with an airport express that I setup in my hotel room, connected to the hotel wired internet (if there isn't a wired connection, the setup doesn't work).  I can then plug in my Chromecast and it connects to the airport express and I'm set to watch whatever I want in my hotel room on demand.  Sweet!

B00ESB6GBY|4.0|Consistently funny and cute sitcom that we've enjoyed for many years. Not the best show I've ever seen, but is a really nice show to watch if you're looking for something ~20 minutes long that isn't too serious. Fun and light hearted.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|I loved this movie and the message it conveyed.  I have watched it a few times now.  I would happily recommend it to friends!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Book 1 had the best action and it draws you in with it's vivid and creative backdrop and wild ride as Tris starts to tap into who she is and what she is capable of.<br /><br />Book 2 is cool because it developed the characters and the plot into something bigger, richer...you start to have this sense of a growing importance and scale to the characters, their relationships, and their plight.<br /><br />Book three starts a bit slow but ultimately delivers the richest and most rewarding character interactions, plot twists, and action sequences.  Its intensity is made more meaningful, raw, and indelible as it tackles some weighty themes spanning tragedy, romance, coming of age, the power of family and friendships, socio-political justice, and I dare say at times the meaning and beauty of life...even when all seems nearly lost, this book reminds you the beauty is there if you look for it in friendship, love, and purpose.<br /><br />Bravery is obviously held up as a beacon of light throughout the chaotic darkness and distress of the series, which grows from one book to the next, and this book is certainly the peak of bravery in the face of darkness.  I would even  go as far as to say that this book itself is brave in going where it needed to go in order to burn that which is truly beautiful about Tris and Four, both individually and as a couple, into your memory for a long time to come, and in a way that is honest and true to the way life is.  There is apparently some controversy over where this book ventures to go based on some of the reviews posted thus far.  I feel that if you, too, can be brave in how you ultimately process what happens in this book, you will be rewarded with the kind of memories you hope to have at the conclusion of an epic...like you are sad to part ways with people you have come to care about deeply, and like you are rubbed a bit raw with emotion if it strikes a personal chord on some levels, but at the same time you feel elevated by the beauty of the characters and ever grateful to have them in your heart and mind for a long time to come after the turn of the last page.  If you are brave, you will see no controversy.  And you will want to remember.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent graphics,  very fun to play. it was challenging,  but not overly so. I only got stuck a couple times,  but with the hints it was easy to figure out. It was easy to control unlike some other games I've played. All the puzzles were interesting and enjoyable. Wish it was longer and can't wait for more!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I thought this book was written as well as the first two, but I didn't Iike the ending. It seemed as though Roth wanted it to end abruptly.
B006QPX7UI|2.0|Watched this after a family trip to Gettysburg, which was great. Made us all curious, and wanted to watch some movies about the history of Gettysburg, but this movie was a snoozefest.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My five year old so LOVES this game. He plays it every day! Worth every cent. Recommend it to everyone that likes to build things.
B00FEN000S|3.0|It's a bit Godzilla vs. Transformers only bad. I watch a lot of movies and I see what they were trying to do but I think they failed. You have these giant machines that you control with your mind, but you have you use your legs to run, walk, move? entertaining in a pinch.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Slow to start but it really picks up.  The last 100 pages were fantastic and unpredictable!  I selected this book for my November book club and I'm glad I did.  There will be much to discuss and I'm sure we will have some interesting opinions!
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise I ran into. As a long time fan of Stone Temple Pilots, I had to pick this up. The album only has a few songs but still makes for a great album. I'm enjoying all the tracks and I'm glad I have another Stone Temple Pilots CD to add to my collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|long flight? perfect? killing time in a waiting room? definitely! so much fun! I play on an original kindle fire and it plays beautifully. very few lags. great graphics! get it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My 3 yr old loves this game the animals are his favorite &amp; the graphics he is in love with he loves this game period many games he has but this is by far his favorite
B009CGGCSC|5.0|I absolutely loved all the upbeat, singing, story and fun, in this movie. I watch it over and over then finally decided it was time to own it.
B0015XHP4K|4.0|although corny, but typical Stallone they are entertaing to watch when you are desperate and can't find anything else on TV
B001EN71DQ|1.0|the movies are just incredibly bad on so many levels it's not even funny and I can only attribute this to the laziness of George Lucas.  He had mountains of money (billions) and time (20 years) to plan out the most amazing star wars films, at least on par or close to the originals...but he failed spectacularly.<br /><br />I attribute the failure primarily to his overuse of CGI and general laziness in mapping out the plot.  The overuse of CGI was the true cause of the wooden acting in my opinion and the lack of a \\"real\\" feeling.  The plot was also just incredibly stupid.  There were also a million foolish things that make no sense, we go back and forth between seeing Anikan sadistically kill children to seeing slapstick robot humor, it really makes no sense.  I have no idea what genre this film is and nothing makes any sense.<br /><br />And although the cast was filled with talented actors, Anikan was miscast twice imo.  And the love story was not believable.  Padme was too much of a hard-head and Hayden was too much of a whiner.  The two would have hated one another irl and we can just sense it on screen by the way the characters treat one another.  Padme seems to hate Anikan and Anikan's character seems more interested in adventure and power than girls.<br /><br />I don't know this whole trilogy is like bad breath on the star wars saga.  I wish it was never made.
B00EO10M54|5.0|I have all of Miley Cyrus' albums and this album turned out to be great, not as great as her Hannah Montana albums, but still a pleasure to listen to. While I don't enjoy her antics and desperate acts for attention, I focused on the music and that was enough to get me to buy this item. It's a great listen and great addition to the rest of you Miley Cyrus CD's should you already have one.
B0041KVYIW|2.0|Obviously Revolver is a great album but this particular one was warped when it came in the mail. Very disappointed.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It is a good app and fun to use.I like this a lot and is one of my favorite games.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|The movie itself is a classic. It remains one of my all time favorite Tim Burton films. Even all these years later, it's still fresh and funny and completely unique.<br /><br />I docked one star from my rating because of the video quality. While this Blu-ray is a worthy and noticeable upgrade from the DVD, it could and should be better. While the lossless audio track is pretty solid, sadly Danny Elfman's excellent score sounds a bit muddled here. It really should have been remixed and remastered for the transition to 5.1 surround. In regards to the video, this is the best Beetlejuice has ever looked on any home viewing media. However, it was clearly struck from the same HD master as the most recent DVD release. It's too bad Warner didn't take the time to clean up the print and strike a new 2K or 4K master. This movie really deserves the full, Blu-ray upgrade treatment.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, it's still a recommended buy. Most fans won't be disappointed and unless Warner decides to release a &#34;collectors edition&#34; or something in the future with newly restored audio and video, this is the best Beetlejuice you're going to get for home viewing.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|if you want action, this won't disappoint, Having The Rock in it was a nice change of scenery. Not a bad sequel.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints! I can see this as a hit movie in the near future! Exciting, thrilling and emotional!
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I took a chance on this CD, buying without listening to any songs and my gamble paid off. The tracks are great, the songs are joyful to listen to, and the girls are hot to look at.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I liked the actor for Dredd I think he did a pretty decent job.  I have however never seen a co-star so horrible she (Olivia Thirlby) screws up the entire movie, not until I watched Dredd that is.  I'd pay to see a sequel to Dress if that character is killed off, not replaced, killed in the opening 3 minutes.  The only other problem was Ma Ma never seemed like a credible threat.  A well written and directed sequel would do better.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Yes, Star Trek has fallen into the trap of &#34;explosions keep the audience's attention&#34; that wasn't all that prevalent in the olden days when Gene Roddenberry had direct control of the franchise.  But that doesn't mean the writers and creators of this alternate timeline have ignored the relationships and the banter and fun that are integral parts of Star Trek.  Yes, this movie is continuing the pattern of making this all seem much more grim and gritty, but once again they've stuck to the core concepts of the crew being family.  And with the new timeline there are so many stories that can happen in different ways it makes me very excited for this reboot universe.  I was wary.  I am happy to report that my fears were put aside most gently and I truly enjoyed this movie.  I hope there are many more.  These actors are playing roles that have been almost set in stone, but they do bring fresh perspectives and breath new life into them.
B00003CXI1|5.0|i have watched this several times and enjoyed every bit of it. so nice to the all the harry potter stars so young when they started their film careers.
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan was excited about another movie with him in it, but it's starting to seem desperate. The story line was a bit ridiculous, but it was action packed, so if that is what you are looking for it won't disappoint
B009JCL58G|5.0|I watched the movie and loved it so much I bought the sound track. I listen to it daily on repeat and cannot figure out why it is so great and mesmerizing. I normally do not like this type of music but when I listen to it I feel entranced and able to focus on what I am doing.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Does AFI fail to disappoint? This album has been a long time coming and I was glad to finally able to get my hands on this. After the first listen, I loved it. After the third listen, I'm still loving it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This series has been long in terms of number of books.  &#34;A memory of Light&#34; is the final story, and is very well written, finalizes the characters well and in general, is a must read.  The &#34;Wheel fo Time&#34; series is suggested for those who enjoy this genre.
B008EL25LE|4.0|I'm a big match three fan. This one poses somewhat of a challenge into it! Good game for the Kindle!
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Tracy has caught the breath and scope of the artist and those who suffer because and for them and others.<br />A love affair without sex yet sexual in nature. A great read.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Not your old Star Trek. I am not a trekkie, but the new movies are fun, exciting and glad I gave them a chance. Have seen the old ones and was a bit worried at first. Now I am a fan. Still won't be dressing up :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son can't stop pestering me to get new cars and levels. Told him a new beach level and hovercraft are available, so I'm waiting for the update to come for the kindle game version.
B008WALV94|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. It's something new and different from Belinda, though the outcome is still the same: Another great album. This was great to listen to, and after my third time through the album, I'm still enjoying it.
B009LDD22U|5.0|If you're buying season six you already know how great this series is.<br /><br />Go for it and you won't be disappointed.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was my first time reading anything by Dashner. I picked it up only because my middle school-aged daughter couldn't seem to put it down, and I wanted to know what all the addiction and fuss was about. I was hooked by the second chapter. I kept having flashbacks to Lord of the Flies, Holes and Hunger Games but they were brief. This book is truly unique in its approach to a dystopian teen nadventure. It is ripe with unusual yet lovable characters, bringing to mind a number of popular entertainment (Goonies, Survivor) but never really re-hashing them. If you plan to recommend this to younger readers (like my daughter), I say it's a &#34;go&#34; and would encourage parents with the creative use of expletives/cursing. Rather than using actual curse words the &#34;society&#34; of characters has developed their own language, including expletives which are no worse than &#34;klunk&#34; and &#34;shank&#34;. Their meaning is understood without peppering a story meant for younger teens with inappropriate words. Besides the plot is enthralling no matter your age.<br /><br />It's worth the race!
B009K0P10K|4.0|with Emily and her goal of revenge on everyone who &#34;did her wrong&#34;.  Some of the story lines are starting to be a bit far-fetched, but still entertaining, all the while.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job. He should have won the Academy Award for this. His singing and acting was unbelievable, dare I say sounded better than the real Johnny Cash.
B00CL151G4|5.0|It is easier to appreciate this modern version of the Sherlock Holmes mythology without the commercials and at one's leisure.  The introduction of a new setting (New York) and a female Watson (Lucy Liu) caused some concern in the beginning, however by the end of this first season both seem to work.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|I love this CD! Zendaya is hot and her music is awesome!!! I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the entire album was a great listen. Hopefully there will be some remixes of her hits to follow. That would definitely add to the joy of her already great music.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I understand that this book and the others in the trilogy were written for a young person's market.  Oops, I am in my seventies and I enjoyed the heck out of all of them.<br /><br />Very well written and with with exciting plots and lessons for all ages to be learned and remembered.<br /><br />Urge all your friends, of all ages to try the trilogy, starting with 'Hunger Games'. I think they will find them a good read as well as a reminder that 'Freedom is not free'.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I cannot come up with sufficient accolades for Mr. king, but I have loved reading his works down the years.  The proudest title I can have is as one of Mr. King's &#34;Constant Readers&#34;.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I thought this was a little bit over the top for violence.  Of course, some people advised I stick with it and it gets better.  I just couldn't make it, though.
B0019IMVDG|4.0|We went through our mob movie phase and this was ok. was violent, expected, but longer than it needed to be. I still reccomend if you are looking for mob/gangster movies
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad to get this game on my kindle..love this game. so addictive..thank you so much for finally adding this game on kindle fire.....
B00BD62X14|5.0|This was a such a great CD to purchase. I couldn't believe how beautiful her voice and music were. From the first track to the last, this is a fantastic CD to buy.
B00D014E4Y|3.0|This movie is for children, pure and simple.  It takes talent to create a movie for children that is also enjoyable for adults, and in my case the movie succeeds, but obviously your mileage may vary.<br />Lex Luthor wants to be President.  He figures his main obstacles will be Batman and Superman, so he breaks the Joker out of jail to help him defeat the two heroes.  The main focus is on Batman, with Superman as a supporting character.  In the final battle sequence, the whole (well, most of them) Justice League (Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Cyborg [Martian Manhunter just does monitor duty]) joins in.  Other Batman villains the Penguin, Two Face, Catwoman, Bane, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn appear in brief cameos.<br /><br />If you're a comic book geek, you might overthink this and say \\"Luthor doesn't really need the Joker to help him,\\" and as an adult, common sense would leave you wondering \\"how would Luthor become President just by getting the votes of Gotham City?\\"  So don't overthink it and you'll be fine.  There's nothing much here that would go over the heads of a 10 year old, other than a possible reference to \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" about 2/3 into the movie.<br /><br />Batman's voice is provided by Troy Baker, who's provided the voice for numerous US animation and anime characters, including the second Greed from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  The voice of the Joker is provided by Christopher Corey Smith, but my untrained ear thought it was Mark Hamill.  The voice actor for Superman/Clark Kent is Travis Willingham (Fullmetal Alchemist's Roy Mustang.)  Lex Luthor is by Clancy Brown (who provided Luthor's voice for the animated Superman series )<br /><br />I don't think the film has anything parents need to worry about: there's no blood, no deaths, and Catwoman and Wonder Woman aren't particularly sexy because they're, ya know, Legos.  The film has the nicest, sweetest version of Superman I've ever seen on film, even nicer than Christopher Reeve, which makes it a little creepy that Batman has a stockpile of kryptonite \\"just in case Superman goes bad,\\" but that's about the most \\"objectionable\\" thing I can think of.<br /><br />Rating is based primarily on age of the viewer:<br />4.8 stars for 5-9 year olds*<br />3.8 stars for 10-12 year olds*<br />3.4 stars for teenagers still capable of enjoying this kind of thing<br />1.8 stars for typical teenagers<br />2.9 stars for adults still capable of enjoying this kind of thing<br />1 star for typical adults<br />0 stars for people hate CGI.  (I don't believe the film contains any actual Legos.)<br />*Caveat: these ratings are only a guess and should be confirmed by actual children<br /><br />DVD extras<br />-Not a whole lot.  Some previews, a couple of episodes of \\"Brave and the Bold,\\" an episode of \\"Teen Titans.\\"ve, which makes it a little creepy that Batman has a stockpile of kryptonite \\"just in case Superman goes bad,\\" but that's about the most \\"objectionable\\" thing I can think of.<br /><br />Rating is based primarily on age of the viewer:<br />4.8 stars for 5-9 year olds*<br />3.8 stars for 10-12 year olds*<br />3.4 stars for teenagers still capable of enjoying this kind of thing<br />1.8 stars for typical teenagers<br />2.9 stars for adults still capable of enjoying this kind of thing<br />1 star for typical adults<br />0 stars for people hate CGI.

B005PK57NU|5.0|Wow!! The best season yet! Omg! I never thought there will be a day that I'll be disappointed at Alicia... Can't wait to see how this play out... But I fear the Alicia and Will team is never going to happen... :-(..
B002XTBEDI|5.0|was as good as the original.  I really enjoy these British miniseries.  The characters are amusing and the story lines were great.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Great story. I would recommend it. I had already read the second Maggie Newberry mystery not realizing that it was part of a series.  Hope there are more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It makes me so happy Amazon added this to their app finally! It is wonderfully addictive. Need I say more?
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Halcyon Days Deluxe Edition is worth getting. I loved this CD. Ellie Goulding has a beautiful voice that makes this deluxe edition even more special because you get more of her to listen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|easy setup and a lot cheaper than cable...luv it!<br /><br />we have netflix and use our laptop as the &#34;remote&#34; and it's even for my kids to use.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|This movie was ok. I thought it would be better. it was a cool idea and cool effects. but i could have waited for redbox instead of shelling out 5 bucks
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|like this movie.  I'm a little over Tom Cruise, but he did a good job on this one and I liked the fact that they didn't push the usual male lead/female lead romance at all.  Good story with a twist at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have to say I won this and didn't purchase the item.  My TV sits about 8 feet from my wireless router.  My laptop is about 5 feet away.  First installation, it knocked my wireless router off and took over as the main router for everything.  Took about 3 minutes to reset that and had everyone reconnect to the network.  Easy fix, but it was pain not knowing why I suddenly had not wifi in the house.<br /><br />The only thing I can stream is Youtube.  I tried streaming from my laptop and it runs great the fisrt 2 minutes, then the screen freezes but the audio continues to go along as if nothing is wrong.  I've tried to fix this but I can't seem to make it work with streaming videos from my laptop.  The upside of streaming Youtube from my S4 is that I can create a play list and leave it alone or add new videos.  This works great for thinks like Nerd Machine panel interviews that run an hour long.  Once in a while it will drop the network connection.<br /><br />I have a roku plugged into my tv, plus an xbox, and HD attentna.  I have no problems with my roku connection and can stream movies from amazon prime no problem, netflix no problem.  I've read some reviews that says the roku box can cause interference, but the two are not next to each other and the roku is off when I'm using the Chromecast.  I'll try disconnecting the roku this weekend, if that's the cause, it will be disappointing because the roku is used more than the chromecast.<br /><br />Finally got it working and loving it.  I don't use it much but it has been useful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally I can play on my kindle fire! Highly addictive! It helps keep my mind busy and I love playing it!
B00D9PUXQY|4.0|This CD is a great listen. If you have any of DevilDriver's previous CD's you can expect the same rocking kick-butt songs you've come to enjoy.
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|This group's music is very unique and outstanding in a field of mediocrity.<br />Candice Night is the best lyricists I have ever heard.  What a great poet she would have made in the years of which Richie Blackmore derives the group's music.
B008AX1HD8|1.0|Before I attempted The Bat I was embarrassed about enjoying Lee Child's Jack Reacher series as much as I do, regarding it as low-brow and not much more than cheap escapism. Having tried really hard to get into this book, however, I realized that Lee Child actually writes really well, in the sense that his writing doesn't get in the way of the narrative and he consistently achieves a satisfying economy of expression that — as pared back as it is — still paints a vivid picture of the story.<br /><br />Frankly I found the standard of Jo Nesbo's writing comparable to that of a mediocre high-school composition, the characters lifeless and (less of a problem because this genre requires some suspension of disbelief) the content itself unconvincing and flat.<br /><br />This might be perfectly good fare for someone who just enjoys the genre, but if you appreciate the writer's craft I think you'll struggle as I did (to the point of giving up on it entirely).
B00BI73CVI|3.0|that 1) my husband HATES musicals.  2) this WHOLE movie is singing. 3) Russell Crowe singing? Really?!? 4) Redeeming factor for only a small part: Anne Hathaway - whoa she blew the role out of the water and the singing part was perfect for the character.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|So glad I was not the only person to pass on the kool-aid when this Gatsby was released in the cinemas. BUT, to my eternal regret, after suffering through the Buzzkill Luridman version on DVD, it hit me how grossly I had underestimated the Aussie knack for hideous kitsch. When compared to Luridman's Fantasia on a Theme by Inspired by Fitzgerald, the problematic 1974 Gatsby becomes the very model of refinement. At least the '74 version has a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who apparently did actually read the original novel.<br /><br />Everything we see here suggests that Luridman was much too discombobulated on a combo of pills, powders, pot or whatever to maintain the concentration to even listen to the audiobook for such a very short novel. His movie is ludicrously over the top, utterly tone deaf, and quite possibly displays either:<br />(a.) the tackiest art direction in the entire history of Hollywood or<br />(b.) the worst, most cluttered and absurdly excessive CGI,<br />either (or both) of which make for rather a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />The casting is absurdly awful throughout, with the minor exception of Carey Mulligan, who does marginally more resemble a brain-dead Daisy Buchanan than Mia Farrow did in the '74 Robert Redford vehicle, where at least Redford had quasi-charming moments as Gatsby (and wore the Ralph Lauren wardrobe reasonably well). Leo DiCaprio's Gatsby, when not preoccupied with doubling for the Pillsbury Dough Boy, demonstrates somewhat less charisma than a cardboard cut-out surrounded by a gaggle of gargoyles, and to call Toby Maguire \\"lame\\" playing Nick Carraway would be truly unkind to genuinely handicapped and disabled people.
B004H22RTY|4.0|Was waiting for a long time to get this at a great price. Now my RE SB collection is complete (at least until the next RE movie comes out and if it gets a SB in the US).
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was challenging, with many levels, locations and puzzles.  I also like the story behind the game.  I did find it difficult at times to deduce the next step in the game, so I did have to consult a walkthrough in order to figure out what I should do next.  However, I highly recommend this game and found it well worth the price.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy this game it is fun and a good challenge. No wonder it is so popular, it sucks you in!
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Wish there were more movies like this being made today! Great family movie.<br />Grandchildren actually sat thru the entire movie. Good entertainment for adults and children
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I wasn't expecting the story line.  However, you just didn't see exactly how it was going to turn out, so that was the best part. Surprise at the end.
B00CL1SQVG|5.0|Its difficult for me to pick my favorite Emerson Lake and Palmer Album, but this one is right up there. The Tarkus Suite is just a masterpiece. For me I do still listen to this and enjoy it as much as when it was released. Emerson Lake and Palmer still do it for me very much.
B009346RSS|4.0|How much do you need to spend to get a decent DAC? Some people will tell you that this little number is you'll ever need. Others will swear that you need to spend thousands, that if you spend any less and you might as well pull a Van Gogh.<br /><br />Let's see how the Fiio does against a few other options. I compared four DACs:<br /><br />1) Fiio D03k<br />2) Musical Fidelity V-DAC (original model)<br />3) Emotiva XDA-2<br />4) The DAC inside my Vizio E420i lcd tv<br /><br />I've got more details at the end of the review, but here's a summary of my semi-scientific testing methods: I downloaded an SPL meter app for my iphone and placed it in the same location for all these tests. I measured a baseline SPL for my amplifier, and used that as a point of comparison.<br /><br />I'd say the most important measurement for a DAC is signal-to-noise ratio. Most sources and DACs tend to have roughly comparable signal levels, so the noise level is what's going to primarily distinguish them. For my first test, I measured the noise floor of the DACs by measuring the sound levels with no signal coming from the source. The results, relative to my amp's baseline:<br /><br />Fiio d03k: +11db<br />V-DAC: 0db<br />Emotiva: + 2.5db<br />Vizio TV: +20db<br /><br />Looking at these results, the V-DAC is the winner, followed closely by the Emotiva. These are both a good deal quieter than the Fiio, which beats my TV by a similar margin. It looks like you get what you pay for, but the operative word is \\"pay\\": the Emotiva is over 10x as expensive as the Fiio, and even a used v-dac is 3-4x the price of the Fiio.<br /><br />To follow up I measured the signal levels of the V-Dac and the Fiio (Unfortunately I'd already boxed up the Emotiva before I thought to do this, and the TV's noise floor was so miserable I didn't think it was worth it). Playing a 1000hz sine wave at the same (moderate) volume, the v-dac's output was 2.5db higher than the Fiio. So the total gain in signal-to-noise ratio between the two DACs is 11+2.5 = 13.5db (remember, decibels are a logarithmic scale). That's a bit lower than the advertised difference (98db vs 116db). Since Stereophile measured the v-dac at its advertised 116db, I'm guessing the disparity is due either to the imprecision of my methods, or modesty on Fiio's part.<br /><br />To wrap all this up, the Fiio is a fine little dac that's cheap and should give you the full quality of 16-bit (cd quality) audio. Still, if you're willing to spend more you can do measurably better in terms of sound quality.<br /><br />--- more methodological details -----<br /><br />Full disclosure, I'm not a professional reviewer or audio engineer, I'm just someone who reads about audio equipment on the internet too much.<br /><br />The app I used was called \\"decibel.\\" It measures the ambient SPL based on the iphone's mic. I'm not sure how accurate it is on an absolute scale, but it is consistent. Since I only want to measure differences that's probably good enough. Then, I set the iphone on top of one of my speakers (PSB 5t) with the mic near the tweeter for all of the tests. Then, I set my Rotel RA-1060 integrated amp to maximum volume and measured the noise level with no inputs connected. There's a bit of white noise from the amp at this level. The ambient room SPL was 40.5db and the measurement from the amp with no inputs was 44db. The results reported above are relative to this baseline.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the sheep is not only a kid-friendly show, but it is also entertaining for adults! Whenever we pull out Shaun the sheep, my 2 year old niece is glued to the screen, and the rest of us can't help but watch episode after episode. Real quality here!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is still a master of weaving together threads, people, places ,times, and events that all come together in unforeseen ways to make the fabric of a compelling tale. I got nothing done for 2 days because I had to read this book!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I only began watching Doctor Who when David Tennett was introduced as the 10th Doctor because I had seen him in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and wanted to learn more about him. So...after watching now for a few years, I decided I needed to go back and pick up the episodes with the Ninth Doctor. I was not disappointed. I've become a huge fan of this series and was happy that I had the option to watch back episodes on Amazon Prime. Thank you!
B004R0WKNE|4.0|and entertaining.  I was just happy that they didn't push a romantic situation between the two main characters. Well acted.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I've tried quite a few metronome apps and this one has features which are simply amazing. I love that you can not only set the beat to hold, but that you can create new beats for new sounds and adjust and change everything about it. Interface is easy to use and looks great. Sounds can be adjusted and changed. My favorite prior to this was Metronome Beats Pro, which has a few features I also like, but overall, I now prefer this one. Great job!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A fascinating legal thriller that's impossible to put down, this book will continue to haunt you long after you've finished. Told from the viewpoint of a man whose shy 14-year-old son is accused of murdering a classmate, we see the slow disintegration of his family, his marriage, his profession as the legal system takes its toll. Even if the &#34;evidence&#34; can be explained away, even if the jury returns a not guilty verdict, can they ever escape the accusation itself? The doubts even their closest friends feel? Can his wife and child ever escape the secrets of his family history that leak out? Was he wrong to have hidden an ugly truth from them? As shattering as the accusation is, there is much more terrible in store...<br /><br />There is good reason this book ended up on the New York Times Bestseller List...it's dynamite!
B001GCUER0|5.0|Mad Men had me hooked. I was a latecomer to this series, but once I found out about it, I was hooked! Bought 7 seasons and went through them pretty quickly. I liked all of them!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. John green had some deep thoughts in this book making me think twice of certain things. I must say though this book was very sad. I'm not going to give away anything, but honestly I would recommend this book to anyone. It truly is a love story I'll want to re read even if it made cry a lot. All those tears were worth it in the end.
B000L53D4O|5.0|I did not think it would grow with her, but she is nearly 15 months and still plays with it every time she comes over.  It is easy to set up and fold down.  Lots of activities for her.  Good product.
B0031KE9C6|3.0|for this story.  I watched the first one and then didn't ever go back to it.  I don't recall just why except that it didn't suit my tastes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great entertainment.  good value!  puzzles aren't too difficult.  enough to satisfy and give you sense of accomplishment.  good job devs!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|..like Yann Martel's writing style and sense of humor. The story made me think about the role of religion in a different manner.
B005IQZB14|3.0|If you have an interest in hiking this would interest you. I do, and it did. However I felt it really dragged in parts and I found myself skimming ahead to something that would actually hold my attention. After reading it I'm more curious how the book will be portrayed in the movie.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The book was not as scary as the Shining, but should it be made into a movie the possibilities are certainly there. It did keep my interest all the way through and was a very good read. I would definitely reccomend to all Stephen King fans.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Funny.  Enjoyable. Different. Would recommend to anyone.  Certainly provided me with new and different thoughts about persons that are &#34;different&#34; from the &#34;norm&#34;.
B005OP7162|5.0|What a crazy girl - and a story line to go with her! It's like a soap opera with twists and turns - and better acting than daytime.  You like a character - then hate the same character - and maybe fall back in like with them! It's hard to imagine all of this, so just go with the fantasy of revenge on just about everyone!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The characters are beautifully developed within the language of flowers.  Diffenbaugh gives the reader complex characters whose flaws and strengths are believable and give the story a compelling plot.  It is an uplifting book and great for book clubs.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is one of the best 007's there has been, great graphics and stunt action. shipped in great time and was packaged well.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Left out some details I would have liked to know- how and where did it start?  But interesting format, held my attention
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Ok this is a fun way to spend some down time. My only. Problem with game is you can only go so far. Then free game cost you real money to get more levels. Sorry guys no can do. In my book free mean just that free. Will I buy more?  No, ask my friend on fb sure. All in all great game (not free) in the end
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I have enjoyed each and everyone one of Michael Connelly's book. this one was just as suspenseful as  the others.<br />Thank you for  giving me hours of enjoyment in reading
B00F35BV64|4.0|if this was going to be good since it is a new generation for me. However, I did like it.  They did the back story very well.  It kept your interest throughout.
1452110581|4.0|Hilarious and purrfect for cat lovers! The titles are cleverly labeled, and the accompanying pictures compliment the poems very well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun. And a challenge I enjoy playing on my kindle fire original more than my razor cell phone the bigger screen allows for easier play
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|TWD  is getting better and better.  Never know what is coming next.  so glad they got renewed  for season 5 !
B004ZBFRTY|1.0|This did not work on my blu ray player. Its a great package with tons of extras but no, am sadly going to return it. And was looking forward to watching one of my favourite movies
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush is a fun game to play and I am glad it is available on a mobile device. Lives can run out quicky when playing the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't often have time to read, but I bought this on my Kindle thinking I'd read it every now and then.  I didn't realize how long a book this was until I saw the page count online -- I breezed through it because it is just so ridiculously good!  This book takes place over the course of about a week and is written from three different 3rd person perspectives interwoven throughout the plot.  At first, I was struggling to find out how all three woman were related to each other, and then throughout the book you discover more and more about their secrets.<br /><br />It should be titled &#34;Everyone's secret&#34; because it goes into detail about what happens when people keep secrets, and what those secrets might be about.<br /><br />The level of detail Moriarty goes into isn't boring like a list of food at dinner, but it's intricate and purposeful like someone's thought process.  Great read!
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|All of the songs, all of the actors, every part of the scenery and costumes are wonderful.  They have picked the best singers and dancers to depict this movie perfectly
B002RXZF6C|4.0|Good visuals...but sound was somewhat disrupting. Sometimes you could hardly hear what was being said and other times it was very loud. But never the less it was fun seeing it.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I was so excited to find Hocus Pocus on blue ray. It is a childhood favorite and I am so excited to have it in our collection so we can share it with our kids when the get a little older.
B004IK30S2|5.0|I hope the new one is just as great as this one, one of the best comedies ever in my opinion
B003G4W49C|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down. Loved the twists and loved the ending. Bitter sweet that it had to end! Can not wait for the movie. But books are always better!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|It was interesting, but if your fear is telling the truth with no one believing you, or believing you but not willing to help, then this is a show for you. Zachary Quinto was by far my favorite character. There are some hokey moments that are meant to scare people who like the cliche monster. Overall, I think it's better than the first season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it!!!! Once you start playing you can't stop!! I love the challenge. I must say it is a very addictive game.
B002MG2RG0|5.0|It was wonderful seeing this again...loved it when I was young... and as good now. Sound varied some but nothing you couldn't live with.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Fun game. Liked the simplicity of it. I wouldn't have bought, but as a free paid app it is decent.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|I am really into Japanese animation cause they know how to capture a massive dramatic scene that would never exist. This movie does just that.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I really enjoy this take on Snow White!  It's way more interesting than anything I read as a small child.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this read.  Have always found the lead character wonderfully quirky and yet at times altogether too sane and serious.  He's freakishly intelligent and a fascinating fellow.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for Amazon to get this game. I love to play it. Would recommend everyone downloading this one.  Fun
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|My wife didn't ask me to pause the movie on the frequent times she left the room, which lets me know her opinion.  The premise was good enough that I kept the movie on, but I was thoroughly underwhelmed.  Jadan Smith isn't a strong enough actor to be the sole person on screen for 75% of the film, and the rest of the characters lackluster and not very well fleshed out.  Inconsistent accents were distracting, and the ending was completely predictable even though it didn't follow Shyamalan's usual \\"twist\\" ending (and hte only reason it took me until 1/3 of the way into the movie to know how it would end was because I kept trying to think of what the \\"twist\\" would be for that first third.) Definitely not worth watching a second time and I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way to watch it a first time.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I Love this show! Rewatched and enjoyed it as much the second time around! I love the characters and their drama along with the daily drama in the courtroom!!
B003IWYOF4|5.0|What a great movie to have in my collection. I will watch it many more times and share the laughs with others
1451666179|5.0|I love to read.  And i buy books on amazon and for my kindle all the time.  It has been a long time since I belly laughed out loud reading a book.  I even put it down so I can enjoy more tomorrow...to prolong the reading of it.  That never happens!!  This book is fantastic.  I completely relate to ALL of it.  Thank you Allie (you don't know me, but maybe you ARE me? Or a way funnier version of me?). I love this book so much.  Also, it's much bigger than i imagined, meaning way more content than i expected, and a really nice hearty book.  You did everything right with this book.  You can tell there was attention paid to all details.  &#60;3
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|Not as good the the first - but still good clean fun - 1 bedroom scene where you will see &#34;naked backs&#34; - everything is implied - no swearing, lots of action.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|this was an exciting film. we watched it with our grandson and great grand daughter EDGE OF THE SEAT film
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book...the struggle for self awareness...and love of self coming to a young woman going thru life full of feelings of abandonment...the growth of her relationships...and the language of flowers...I want her dictionary to stay in my memory!
B00FN811SY|3.0|Fantastic app for serious Bible students and scholars.  Works great on my iPad, iPhone, and Android devices.  Unfortunately, it will not install on any version of the Kindle.  This is too bad.  I truly enjoy the Kindle for reading, in fact, prefer it over the iPad.  It would be very helpful if Amazon made this app compatible.  I am not sticking with Amazon until they improve their compatibility issues.  If not for this serious problem, the Kindle would rule the tablet world for reading, video, and other similar interests.  Until then, it is very limited and cannot compete with the other tablets that do offer a wider range of applications.<br /><br />UPDATE  11/5/2013:  I'm keeping my old HD Kindle but returning my new HDX back to Amazon. I cannot use it with the apps I need most. JW Library is outstanding, yet I cannot use it on any of my Kindles. Too bad! The Kindle is a better solution, but useless if I can't use it. I will buy an Apple Air or Apple mini because these devices can use the JW Library. You would think that Amazon would realize these limitations and act quickly to remedy the conflict. Apparently not!<br /><br />One thing they should consider ... there is a huge market among Jehovah's Witnesses. Between 7 and 14 million potential buyers of Kindle, if .... JW library worked. Word would spread quickly if it was, thus creating a great opportunity ... and gratitude ... for Amazon.<br /><br />To give credit where it's deserved ... The application JW ORG PLUS is a browser link that takes you directly to JW ORG and the WT Library.  You can download it for your Kindle.  I highly recommend it for it's ease of use.  There are several other applications you might consider as well.  They all require a small purchase price.  Not certain if they are written and maintained by brothers.  JW ORG PLUS will cross link directly to JW.Org where you can access the library.  Those without the knowledge or time to link to the internet may find this shortcut helpful.  I wrotea review on this app that you might find helpful.<br /><br />Another App that is great, but only available on the Apple iPad and IPhone is EQUIPD.  Great app!  Do a Apple Store search and you can access it.

B00271DNP4|5.0|As with all the Harry Potter movies - this one does not disappoint the viewer - great special effects too, especially the flying scenes.
B008HJGPVO|2.0|To hard to hold.  I didn't like that it's so skinny and slick.<br />I have a pencil grip on it and that helps.  I don't use many of the<br />tips.  Plus it's already wearing out.  I like the screen stylus' MUCH<br />better.  Won't buy this again.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great scrip.<br />Fantastic ideas,  fast action and inteligent, you can watch one after other episode all day, fun and inteligent, great

B000006045|5.0|Nothing bad to say. But did notice that the orange of the CD is brighter then it use to be on the original copies when they first came out
B001NESPHC|5.0|Beautiful music for those who love a bluesy - Joni Mitchell melody with a French twist. She's definitely on my favorites list of Artists!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable story about David and all his future friends faced with somewhat fearsome obstacles.  One point Gladwell somewhat neglects is that Goliath, in his mind, was just stomping out another shepherd boy.  Big disadvantage.
1451666179|5.0|If you've never read Hyperbole and a Half, you should...and even if -- maybe especially if -- you have, you should definitely buy this book...Allie Brosh is perhaps the most honest person you'll ever encounter, and she's damn funny...and poignant at the same time.<br /><br />There are *very* few people who can be legitimately self-effacing and honest at the same time, and Allie is clearly such a person. I'm guessing that this book was terrifically difficult to write and that it caused a lot of second-guessing about what to leave in and what to take out...what's here is a very real, very brave, and yet also somehow seems meant to be.<br /><br />I can tell you this: you won't find another book like this unless and until she writes another one...all the best to you, Allie -- you've clearly faced down a lot (yes, pun intended for fans of the blog) to see this through to fruition, and I sincerely wish you many more years of success as an author and dog, er, whisperer ;-)
B0073XORLU|5.0|This album exceeded my expectation! I don't usually think that follow-up albums like this have much of a chance of working, but my belief in Ian Anderson's genius is well-founded. I wasn't sure how he would achieve this, but he did, tunefully and creatively. The album is one that is as listenable as the first, a high compliment. If you have the chance, don't miss the opportunity to see him perform it live, along with Thick As A Brick 1--pure magic!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I love how edgy horror story manages to be. I wish they'd stick with the same story line, would have been cool to see what those sick minds could have come up with.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I loved this game but then for some horrible reason the game disappeared from my Kindal device (but was saved in my cloud) and when I downloaded it back to my device from my Cloud it started all over form the beginning! I lost all of my Ponys and the Pony Village. I have probably spend about $100 buying Gems so I can buy Ponys. I am very angry and sick to my stomach that this could happen. I want my village back. I am changing my review from a 4 star to a 1 star until this issue gets fixed.
B00CIAYTL6|5.0|I am first and foremost a fan of the Bruce Lee genre. I had always heard about his master Ip Man, but for quite some time, there wasn't anything out about him. I got the first Ip Man to see more about how Bruce Lee's fighting style came into being. I was taken by the story of the man himself, and found a whole new path here...first, anything about Ip Man, who had his own very real trials and tribulations...and then Donnie Yen as the artist who portrayed him. I have a new favorite in martial arts movies in Donnie Yen. I will watch nearly anything that has his name on it. I see here, that Sammo is the one whose name is on the box...but he is NOT Ip Man. Sammo has lots of movie credits under his belt, but he is just not my &#34;hero&#34;, although his skills speak for themselves. Donnie Yen's portrayal of Ip Man is what caught my fancy and fed my idea of the character of the man himself. &#34;Smashing&#34; movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Absolutely love this show, it keeps you on the edge of your seat in every episode. There is so many twists and turns that you are not expecting that you cannot take your eyes off of it.  Love It!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I gave it a 5* because that's exactly what it deserves, a brilliant series that I'm so glad I stumbled across. The only fault I could add is that of the actual DVD, which didn't want to work in my Xbox or DVD player, but it worked in my Laptop...Must be the american make or something, but that wasn't a major problem.<br />All in all, a seriously delicious series that anyone (over the age of 16!) could get their teeth into.
B004WR125O|5.0|This works well. I haven't had it miss out on my wireless network once. It always gives me a strong signal.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is probably the best Grisham book ever. Only read it to get ready for his new book follow on. I am extremely glad I did

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just got this last night after wondering what all the fuss was with my daughter.  Now, I have to say we are both hooked on it. Nice twist
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!!!  I loved the first in 2009 and I love this well as well.  I am not a Star Trek fan but even I love these movies!!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Did not like the movie much, was under the empresition that the movie would have been better actors were poor.
0060555661|5.0|That's the only reason I bought it. You can tell that the content is from a long time ago, but I think the concepts are still applicable today. I'm no financial planner or investor, but this is a cheap book and a good, quick read for anyone looking to get sound advice (for FREE)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I saw some but by no means all of the first season on TV and I was pleased to click my way down the episode list without bothersome ads. I subscribe to Amazon Prime and have caught up through the currently available seasons listed on Prime and will wait for subsequent seasons so I can see all episodes in rotation on Prime without using the DVR or paying $. One area that I found humorous was these lawyers' ability to drink what looked like six ounces of booze straight with nary an ice cube in sight and still always beat the opposition in court!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really fun and I love MLP so much I don't really care if you have to buy stuff you should really play it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is sooooo addictive. The app makes it easy to just quick stuff when you are trying to explain what you mean to someone.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Spashtop Remote Desktop works. It works better than you would think that it would work. Not only does it allow me to view my desktop from my phone on my wifi network at home, it also streams the audio as well. My phone basically functions as a mirror of my monitor. Splashtop Remote Desktop works and it works better than the competition. This is basically the best Remote Desktop that you can acquire without being Batman.
1476712042|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is about a girl named Abby who wants to get away from her past,  she moves with her best friend America to attend a  college at Eastern University. At a underground fight Abby meets Travis Maddox. Travis is America's boy friend Shepley's cousin. They share a apartment together.<br /><br />Abby and Travis become friends. They spend a lot of time together. Travis fell for Abby  at the beginning. Abby was attracted to him but she tried so hard to fight it,  she was scared.<br /><br />They make a bet. If Travis loses he has to remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses she  has to live with him for a month.<br /><br />I loved this book, it was very hard to put down. Jamie McGuire is a talented writer. I love her writing style.<br /><br />I just  loved Travis. He  was so sweet and protective.<br /><br />I liked the parts where Travis brought Abby home to meet his family at the poker game and when he brought her home for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Although the game is free, It's a money pit designed to ensnare feeble minded game addicts into endlessly purchasing &#34;lives&#34; and bonus features until their wallets are sucked dry!
B007SSDS24|5.0|I enjoyed this movie I thought the special effects were pretty cool ,and I think that if you let go of the critical watching of it I think you I think you enjoy it as well. I guess I'm trying to say is if you look at it and say they did this ,and the alien force didn't see them, you know but yet they saw them  in another instance , if you just let that go then  it's an enjoyable film
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|I'm giving it 4 because I really wasn't expecting it to be good at all, but it was and what a surprise.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Its a fun game that is easy to fit into sitting around waiting for an appt. It keeps your mind sharp.
B00985E3UG|3.0|Takes you on a very detailed and long, boring tour through the food industry.<br /><br />I was expecting more of a self help book, not a handbook for how to run my own mega-food company.  That said, it was carefully researched and reasonably well written. If you are trying to develop a theory for why everyone else is responsible for getting you fat, this is the book for you!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is so great.  I'm reading a really heavy book and it's so great to take the book with me on my tablet wherever I go.  The app is easy to use and intuitive.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is on the money. Hi Johnnie here to tell you that this game is for you.If you like to play bingo than this is the game for you. The tournaments are fun. Being able to have teammates adds to the game.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Yeah like this movie a lot I mean what's not to like has Navy SEALs, lots of gunplay ,plenty of patriotism, it's a good guy flick
B00AALX5SI|3.0|my child was interested in katy perry and wanted to see the movie. she was entertained which was great with no raunchiness.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good movie for women, but not for men.  I really enjoyed it, but I don't think my husband would have connected with it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use it all the time. Great for on the go. Recommend it for anything that doesn't require a full fledged 10-key.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read Ender's game over 15 years ago. I remembered it being a great and complex story on many levels. I decided to re-read it before seeing the upcoming movie. This is a story that has stood up to the test of time. The characters are well developed & the author does a great job of putting you inside of them so that you understand what they are thinking and feeling, not just what they are doing. For me, this is still one of the best stories I have ever read. I hope that the movie can do it justice.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I found this to be a pain to read.  I don't like stories where some of the main characters are killed off (usually with a lot of gore).  I don't like having so many characters, it's hard to keep track of who's who.  And I really don't like to graphic blood letting.  No more George Martin for me!
B000IDCJK8|5.0|I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan and prove me personally this is my favorite movie, it's almost a bit of a ghost story Hidden in the Western. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and every time I flip through channels and it comes on I stop channel surfing.  The story was pretty good and the subtheme of both worldly and otherworldly justice was interesting twist.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|Interesting but labored read. Could have been 2/3s the length and been more gripping and less tedious.Still not a baad vacation read.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Great book. Could not stop reading it . Since I have a child with Autism whose high functioning I can tell the book give you some hope , even thought it is just a book . MUST READ!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This doggle is easy to set up and use. I was amazed at how it interfaced so easily and cleanly with my Netflix and YouTube apps on my iPhone. The same is to be said for casting tabs from Chrome on my Dell. The only disappointment is that non-&#34;approved&#34; utilities like Hulu and Amazon Instant Video don't cast well from Chrome on my Dell at all. When I tried to streaming video it was choppy, positive, and overall not watchable. I also could not find a way to use Spotify or iTunes through the Chromecast as well. Google Play worked some, but not as crystal clear as Netflix/YouTube. However, overall it is a wonderful product streaming viewing material to my TV while freeing up my devices.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I decided to write a review because this book is not a 3-star book. I finished yesterday while walking on a treadmill while my hubby lifted weights. That wasn't easy let me tell you. I was upset like the first time I watched Gladiator. But I thought about it later and any other ending would be a cop out. Tris would not have been Tris if she didn't step in. I could see the connections in every character and how they ended up where they did. Advise though....take it slow and enjoy along the way.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book was good why can't I go on to my next book without writing this review. Kindle is getting to be a joke
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Spoilers<br /><br />The thing I disliked most about this book was that there was absolutely no change in voice from the Tris to the Tobias POV.  I was constantly having to remind myself who I was reading.  However, I thought the ending was appropriate to the story.  Tris is a wounded soul.  Compared to the ending for Katniss Everdeen, who was forced to live on despite the utter devastation of her being, I found this ending merciful.  Four had family and friends to help rebuild himself, but Tris was irreparably isolated from everyone left to her, arguably including Four.<br /><br />I thought the (admittedly somewhat heavy handed) statements that the novel makes about identity and about trauma and coping vs actual healing were significant and made it worth the read.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sanderson's novels always have terrific characters, superbly detailed worlds, and well thought out rules for how the &#34;special powers&#34; work.  This novel is no exception.<br /><br />This book is for anyone who enjoys stories about underdogs; the superhero genre; a pseudo-cyberpunk landscape.<br /><br />Every new novel by Sanderson, I believe he outdoes himself - and this one follows suit.  And if you like this, please try his other work because it is just as excellent.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you're into beautiful graphics, free will, and puzzles, this game is for you! It's running and fun and a tad creepy. The puzzle aren't excessively hard, if you just pay attention, everything can be solved. Ooh one amazing bonus, free hints!! That's absolutely awesome for any puzzle game to include free unlimited hints. They don't give the answer away but find more like personal notes. Great game! Totally worth it!!
B00CIVLZ3U|3.0|Good read! If you like Brandons books then you have to read this! Easy read,  one character perspective,  young teenagers would like!
B00G32OER4|1.0|I have waited for this movie to come out on DVD for months.  Talked to a lot of people regarding how good the movie was, or wasn't Not one bad review.<br /><br />I purchased the movie for $14.00. Ordered some Pizza with my girlfriend and sit back for what I  knew was going to be an awesome scary night.<br /><br />Supposedly, according to reviews... \\"you won't be able to sleep!\\" Really???  It was all I could do to stay awake!<br /><br />Paranormal activity went over the line about episode 3. The conjuring couldn't even get out of the box.<br /><br />One word... \\"BORING!\\"<br /><br />Don't waste ur time!
B001VZY4M8|4.0|My partner and I both had the song 'After the Gold Rush' stuck in our heads after hearing it again on the radio. The usual fix for this problem is to listen to the song again but we didn't have this one in our collection. Only solution - order it p.d.q.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|I truly wonder why the need so many musicians. Most of this album sounds like a man and a woman and protools. No live sounding drums and the lyric sheets are pompous. Horrible let down from the suburbs.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was a continuation from the Shinnng.  Stephen King is a wonderful writer and I hope he writes another follow up. To this story.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great read and will help children (and adults) understand how it feels to be different and misunderstood.
B00EVW013E|1.0|I'm not usually too critical of movies, but this had horrible special effects and authenticity. Story and acting were cheesy at best. Not sure what they were thinking when they casted this movie.  I felt the producers were blatantly trying to make a buck from a somewhat compelling marketing scheme.  I was very disappointed.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book kept you reading for the next happening.  It was a little hard to keep up with when it jumped from one story to another.  After the first few I was able to keep up with the events.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My husband and I both love this game. It is soooo addicting.  I seem to end up playing it off and on all day.
B007REV4T8|1.0|An absolute disaster...I could not finish to watch it was so bad...I expected the (usual) great 007...got a bad joke instead...Odious end to a great series...
B009AJD5E0|2.0|I'm the kind of person who will watch a movie all the way through even if it sucks. In fact a film has to be particularly atrocious for me to stop watching half way through. Since I made it to the credits and cracked myself up with baby-momma jokes at the end when the little baby alien popped out, I give Prometheus 2 stars. That's not saying much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I checked until I found the candy crush game on kindle and Its the best. love the game and the device also.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Really sharp pictures and sound! I'm a big fan of the original series.  I loved  watching it with the excellent graphics!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|By far best show on television!!!<br />Ryan Murphy is a genius. Keeps me guessing every season. Jessica Lange is flawless as is the entire cast.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is a top of the line fighting simulator, but could definatly use some better prices and rewards from the achivments.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|No wonder YouVersion is the most popular bible app...slick, customizable, and the interface begs you to read more. The only downside is it lacks study tools like Olive Tree and Acrobible have...but that may be a matter of &#34;so far&#34;.<br />In integrating some if the reading plans into the youth group I lead, and some of the live features into a men's group.
B00873GRU4|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book where the end of each chapter had me thinking &#34;Just one more chapter&#34;. This was most definitely one of those books. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am very keen to read the next one.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|The game itself is really good. But you only get 5 levels, I think. Unless you want to spring for the paid version.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I'm an independent consultant and this app makes calculating orders so much easier! No more parentheses and algebraic equations, just put in the % symbol without having to change anything!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't read many fantasy books but this one captured my own military and Christian sensibilities. It took me to the terror of my own heart and to the coy laughter of innocence.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Just wanted to keep moving on to the next page, but really didn't want the story to end. A fun story and enjoyable.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is a really good CD and I am glad that she is back with some really good music. I recommend that all Cher fans check this CD out.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Even better than part 1. Deffinetly for mature audiances. Great in the collection and I will watch it more than once.
0451169514|5.0|Back in the 90s - before there was ever a Twilight or a Harry Potter - this was the book that I couldn't put down, read breathlessly during 3 summer days/nights, and that transformed my reality to a dangerous world of treacherous water and sewer grates. When the movie came out I made homemade posters, invited my closest friend (also an avid reader [we were 11, cut us some slack]), and jeered at every deviation from the literal page. Thank you, Stephen King. You wrote my favorite childhood book, scared the whatever out of me and my closest friend, and made me want to write a few stories of my own. This is a fantastic book.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I LOVE BINGO BLITZ!  Funnest game on my kindle hasn't disappoined!  The bonuses have become haarder to earn but it's worth the challenge!  It's a free app so you don't have anything to lose (except an exciting game of Bingo)!
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Easily one of the best sequels. Most disappoint by trying to be as good as the original.  This is a brand new story with its roots in the past.  Like the way it all ties up and also the way King has made space for another story.  I am sure Abra would want her own story soon.  All the best Stephen.
B000083E79|5.0|This has all the good hits on it, from the very past oldies but goodies to her dance music of her most recent years. Its a wonderful collection of goodies. Get it now!
B008RV5K4U|5.0|Awsome, for mature audiances, great animation, good in the collection. Rent or borrow if you are not an avid fan.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|I purchased the movie 2 days ago and it still has not downloaded completely so I can watch it - I purchased the movie because it is one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies and am so disappointed in the poor service in downloading.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical lee child novel, suspense and good ending. I couldn't put it down just Like his other books he wrote
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think this is a good dictionary but It needs more explanations<br />Also, it is boring and it has very little words.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|This is Joan Jett at her finest. I was lucky enough to see Joan Jett in West Virginia, so  I knew what to expect, as I seen a good bit of the Unvarnished CD live before it even came out. She is back and Rockin' once again. I recommend that all Joan Jett fans get this latest master piece.
B00A285OOW|1.0|I am not even sure where to start with this train wreck of a novel. I almost didn't even read it after being disappointed with the first three in this series. I had passed on #4, but couldn't resist the story of Elizabeth of York. Little did I know that this book is really the story of her brother, Richard Duke of York, told from her insipid first person point of view.<br /><br />If one is going to write the story of Perkin Warbeck or Richard of York, why not just write that story? Instead, Gregory insists on forcing his story as Elizabeth's, and the result is painful. A majority of this novel focuses on the Warbeck rebellion and the author can't even decide what to call him. This leaves the reader inundated with references to \\"the boy\\", incessantly, until it will seep into your nightmares. Just call him Richard or Perkin for heaven's sake! Besides the fact that this \\"boy\\" is well beyond what is considered an age of majority and the age that his alleged father was king and battle seasoned warrior. I almost stopped reading, but forced myself to persevere to Elizabeth's ending . . . . which is never reached!<br /><br />PG ends with the death of Warbeck and Warwick, not the end of Elizabeth's life. As if the most important, and only, thing that ever happened to her was the York rebellions. Even those aren't covered in their entirety, as Edmund de la Pole is barely mentioned. I am astounded at the number of high ratings this book has received when there is just so much to not like about it.<br /><br />I had hoped for better. Though disappointed with the first three in this series, I had hoped that somebody would do poor Elizabeth some justice. No characterization of her that I have read has honored this woman who has ties to so many kings. Near the beginning of this book, Elizabeth thinks, \\"I am, like England itself, part of the spoils of war.\\" I loved this line and its simple, sad truth. It got my hopes up that the rest of the novel would be as beautifully written, that Gregory would surprise me. She didn't.<br /><br />Before turning too many pages I was sick of hearing Richard III referred to as \\"my lover.\\" I don't even mind that PG decided to make EofY and RIII lovers. Fine, it's fiction. Whatever. But she's a writer, right? Exercise that vocabulary a little!<br /><br />If only that was the only example of repetitious, eye-roll inducing, make-me-want-to-throw-this-book-out-the-window vocabulary. Perkin/Richard is always \\"the boy\\", RIII is always \\"my lover\\", everyone keeps asking \\"what d'you think/mean\\", and Elizabeth's answer to every question is always \\"I don't know\\". Seriously, I have no idea why this is told from her point of view because the girl never knows anything. To emphasize the fact that she is as slow as her cousin, Edward, she frequently repeats what people tell her in the form of a question, creating some of the least compelling dialog that I have ever read. Dialog is repeated, thoughts are repeated, everything is repeated. The novel could be 100 pages shorter if the author wasn't so condescending to the reader.<br /><br />Within the first few pages, the characters had been forced into their stereotypical roles of scheming former Queen (Elizabeth Woodville), scheming want-to-be queen (Margaret Beaufort), naïve-lovesick pawn (Elizabeth of York), and insecure cruel tyrant (Henry Tudor). Henry is particularly poorly done as a tyrannical, suspicious, cruel villain. Then Elizabeth starts to love him, but we don't know why. Then he stops loving her, but we don't know why. ugh.<br /><br />Then we have the magical powers of the York women, which was my least favorite theme in the rest of this series. Labor is painless as floating down the lazy river with Elizabeth Woodville in attendance, and our lovely pair of Elizabeths accidently curse their own descendants though it takes young Elizabeth hundreds of pages to make this connection that the reader made the first time the curse is uttered. Once the light bulb does come on, she is like some kind of prophetess who can foresee the end of the Tudor line with exacting detail. Just don't ask her about anything currently going on or you'll get, \\"I don't know\\" (twirls her golden hair).<br /><br />I'm done. No more PG for me.n, she is like some kind of prophetess who can foresee the end of the Tudor line with exacting detail. Just don't ask her about anything currently going on or you'll get, \\"I don't know\\" (twirls her golden hair).<br /><br />I'm done. No more PG for me.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I was amused to find, at the end of the ebook, an invitation to Review the book or to Share on twitter and Facebook.<br />Isn't this everything this book warns against? What's wrong with this picture? Good god!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't get what is so fun about this game you are just matching candy. NOT THE BEST GAME EVER QUITE BORING I'D SAY
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|If you liked the first movie, and thought the 2nd movie was okay, you'll probably find that this movie is just a little more &#34;blah&#34; than the 2nd movie.  It had some funny moments, but the &#34;Chow is crazy!&#34; schtick has been overdone in the course of 3 movies.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I was kept on the edge the entire time, it was a good amount of action and romance. And the ending made me smile.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is really fun, I have played a million times. I think a lot of people should play this because it fun, Its really entertaining, And I recommend this game for sure.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I can't believe that ending! I am so sad I can't get over it. I kept waiting for it to not be real. I understand that it is supposed to be a tragic story based on a dystopia  but no way did I see that coming. Didn't we kill enough people? And good characters at that!! I'm just so horribly disappointed. I felt as though they would be books I'd go back to in the future but not sure I can now :(  poor Tobias
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I read this book with great anticipation.  I enjoyed the subject matter of botanical studies. Historical novels about strong women, ahead of their time, are right up my alley. The writing style in the first part of the book was elegant and I commented with delight on some of Gilbert's phrasing. But then it lagged and as I read I kept waiting for more highlights  that I could note.<br /><br /> The characters were so flawed that I had a hard time feeling empathy for them.  Relationships seemed contrived.  The book picked up for me in the final chapter of Alma's life and I found writing that I wanted to re-read. I might have liked it more if it moved faster and the writing style was more compelling all through the story.
0345530578|1.0|I've basically read everything Grisham has written and would consider myself a \\"fan\\" of Grisham - he's possibly my favorite author. Even my family knows how much I read Grisham, so I thought when I received two copies of this book as Christmas gifts, I would put one on the shelf for good keeping and read the other without any sort of delicacy.<br /><br />I stopped reading the book after about 100 pages or so. Put it down, tried to restart the book a month later. Put it down again, attempted for a third time to get through it. This seemed to be an experiment for Grisham to which only the hardest of hardcore Grisham fans would probably actually read twice. The story is tedious. The writing style is forced. And, although Grisham can still paint a picture, this was not worth the time.<br /><br />I donated both of my books to the local library in hopes that someone may possibly enjoy this story at some point (sorry to those who gifted this to me). This story was so horribly written, I could not devote any space on my bookshelf for it.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|This movie seemed to flow but it was quite simply not my taste in entertainment. The plot was weak and the characters annoying but they were able to tie it together at the end.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|So, after 9 seasons of listening to Bob Sagget narrating to his kids, the past story of how he met their mother, we finally see who it is... can't believe it's going to be gone...
0120884674|5.0|Whether you conduct scene investigations for a law enforcement agency, coroner's office, or medical examiner's office, I would recommend that you have this book in your scene bag. Easy to find information, clear and concise black and white photos for comparison, and it even has 2 fold-out rulers for scene photos. However, it's not &#34;Bones for Dummies.&#34; It does contain technical information, and you should already have a basic working knowledge of skeletal remains. I also have the author's Human Osteology book, which I highly recommend for students interested in forensic anthropology.
B0007P0LO8|5.0|this is a good opera for the first timer like me. Its easy to understand, the music is so beautiful and the story is incredible. well worth seeing and buying!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I found this to be a very well written book. I like how the author wrote from the different character s point of view. It added a refreshing spin on things and shows that we don't always see the same situation in the same light. My daughter was reading this for school and I decided to read it for myself. I'm so glad I did. I found myself cheering for Auggie throughout the entire book.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesomely gross. Story line has interesting twists and surprises. Acting is good and looks like a fun show to work on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It is soooooooooooooooo much fun! I could play it all day! I love love  love love love love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was on an airplane and ran out of things to read, when I noticed that my teenage daughter had downloaded a preview of this book on my kindle. I read the preview then could not wait to get Internet access to buy the book. After this, I read it for the next week or so every night I got a chance.<br /><br />To attempt to describe this book is to vastly understate it. It's a story about kids with cancer, love, friendship, and cheesy sounding things like that, but it's so much more. It's a book of thoughts. You're inside the mind of the main character, a teenage girl named Hazel who miraculously survives a bout with cancer and who becomes part of a support group where she meets cute and charming Augustus Waters, also a cancer survivor. They become involved in an adventure that takes them to Amsterdam where they have an unfortunate encounter with a former author, now a disgraceful drunk.<br /><br />Over time, some very large changes happen to the characters. In the final analysis, this story proves that life, and indeed the universe, has much more in store than we can possibly realize.
0385738765|4.0|I gave the first book 3 out of 5 stars, but sort of withheld my opinion on the series simply because I wanted to know how things were handled. The first book's beginning started out strong, and sort of fell apart soon as things heated up to the climax. Book 2 starts running, catching you off-guard multiple times, which was usually enjoyable. But sometimes events occurred that seemed to make no sense and had no context. This may be due to the nature of the trials the characters are being subjected to, to disorient them with bizarre events. But its also quite jarring for the reader, where there's long lead-ups to certain events only to have them fall short and leave you wondering what just happened.<br /><br />Despite all that, and the writing style being annoying sometimes- it was still /good/. It was good enough that I am very much looking into the third book of the series. I hope I will find a satisfying conclusion to all the loose ends that are scattered through out the books. Worth a try, I'd recommend it if you are ok with random gory deaths.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The character development and their motives were well done.  You could sympathize with all of the characters.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|This is just a great movie.  It's funny and heart-warming, and colorful, and unique.  My whole family loves it.  We've forced several friends who didn't consider this a Disney movie worth watching to borrow it, and all have the same reaction we did upon first seeing it--how did we miss this?  Stitch is just hysterical.  We love the movie so much that meeting Lilo & Stitch at Disney World was a highlight of our first trip there : )
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really liked this book even though it wasn't as good as the other books. But I can't really say I enjoyed the ending with Tris dying I for one thought her and Tobias were always going to end up together with kids in a mended world... Guess I was wrong. :/ in other words the ending was retarded. Or stupid. I really hated the ending. I hate it SO,SO much.
