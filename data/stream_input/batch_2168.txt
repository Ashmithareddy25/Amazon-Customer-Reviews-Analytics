B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoy reading all Fifty Shades books. I could not put the book down. I love this story how Christian and Ana relationship gets more intimate.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Things that were hinted at in the first book came to light in this one.  Not everything though, leaves you craving the third book.  Relationships develop and more of the character's pasts and personalities come out.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I remember  that Rowley was surprised that Greg was not in military school.this book is good and that's why I gave it this rating.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I have enjoyed it. I like that I was able to download it for free. This is a great find.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|Este libro fue muy bueno para mi.<br />Este junto a los otros Diarios de Greg son mis libros favoritos.<br />Bueno, esa fue mi opinión.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is great. I have enjoyed it. I like that I was able to download it for free. This is a great find.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Bought a small refurbished laptop (HP 2530p) for travel, but it came with a 120GB hard drive, not really sufficient to load it up with movies and music for long plane rides.  Bought the Transcend ExpressCard reader and a 64GB SD card hoping to give me a simple and inexpensive expansion.  Downloaded and installed the Win 7 driver, plugged in the ExpressCard (it's a 34mm and fits flush with the side of the laptop) and it started up perfectly.  Popped in the 64GB SD card (which also fits flush with the side) and immediately had a fast second drive, which is an SSD as well...and didn't have to give up my existing SD slot in the laptop; so for less than $60, I was able to add a second drive that's removable.  Having an SD card for a second SSD has the advantage of using it for a \\"sneakernet\\" as well.<br />  Overall, this product worked perfectly in a Win 7 laptop...gives you lots of flexibility.  I haven't found any cons yet.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The life of Pi is a sad yet touching story about a boy that survives unspeakable fear and isolation after the ship he and his family are travelling on goes down. It speaks of incredible courage and faith.
1451695195|5.0|Alternating chapters between what was occurring on earth with the description of what Eben was simultaneously experiencing in other dimensions makes a fascinating read. I applaud Dr Alexander's courage and honesty as well as his willingness to speak a truth not welcomed in the medical community. Great read!
0765325950|5.0|This book arrived on time and was a joy to read. What a great series---sorry it had to end. Thanks Robert Jordan/Brian Sanderson.
B003B02O3C|2.0|Lacks the mystery and intrigue of past books.  It is all about lawyers, bad ones, good ones and a recent young lawyer admitted to the bar.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is fun, and addictive. it challenges you. plenty of puzzles at varying difficulty. one of the best games on the market. absolutely love it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn is among the best writers.  I have read quite a few of his books and this one holds up to the others.  You'll want to keep reading to the end before putting it down.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|this was good, not his greatest work but good never the less. I would suggest it. I would suggest it
B00A757EFW|4.0|it takes a while to get used to how it works but still pretty cool and lots of fun. (if you like pac-man)
B0017M413M|4.0|Good movie, it stcks with and follows the story line of Stargate, good action, and great cast of course. I would strongly sugget this.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I love this app! I use it all the time. It comes in handy for work items and just about anything. I love snapping a shot of recipes and turning them into pdf format. Print them out and slide in my recipe folder. This is probably the best app I've got on my phone and definitely the most useful .
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I realize this was a serious time in our history, but this movie really bored me.  I would not watch again.  Lots of talking and not much action.  I was confused with what was going on at times.  I can see it winning an academy award though, the academy seems to like these kind of movies.  Media attention to movie is overrated and Ben Affleck is not that great of an actor....the other actors as hostages irritated me.  Sorry to be so negative, I love the movies, but did not like this one..
B004PGO25O|5.0|A must read for anyone who needs a little kick in the pants to get started.  It lets you know your fears are not unique to you - they affect us all.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show! You never know what's gonna happen next I'm get stuck watching it and can't turn it off
0060775858|4.0|Have been reading this to my 2 yr old son and he can't get enough with it. It has now become one of his routines to read this before he goes to bed.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Kept me very engrossed and wishing there were more! I will definitely miss Sherlock Holmes, Sir Conan Doyle was a brilliant author.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Especially if you're a child of the 80's, a video game enthusiast, or just a plain geek. This was exciting from start to finish. Enjoy!
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|What can I say, I have enjoyed every one of Edward Ruterfurd's books. This was a re read for me and just as good the second time aound
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love this game g5 never disappoints.<br />hope to see many more like this one.<br />keep it up. I will be watching for new games especially now that I have a kindle to play them on.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book started off slowly but still held my interest, my  curiosity. The characters were foreign to me, not being all that familiar with people of Ireland in the 1970s. But I gradually came to know these people and was rooting for both main characters all the way to the last line. I wish I could have stayed on, to see them after that last chapter, to have known how their lives were after. The book is very well written, with excellent character details and a unusual combination of sadness and humor.  I might re-read this one some day.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love manning because my mom got me hooked on it and this lets me play the game wherever I want without carrying my laptop around everywhere!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Entertaining game keeps you occupied if you're bored at home GOOD graphics a good free app I recommend it to anyone
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm almost 50 years old and still enjoyed this series.  My 15 year old daughter asked why I was watching a teen show, but this was really a fun and entertaining show to watch when I needed to just relax after a 12 hour work day.
B004I744AS|5.0|Have tried numerous dictionaries..only to be sorely disappointed. Just trying to navigate them was pure aggravation. FINALLY a great product that is simple to use. Online or offline....just love it.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|after downloading 10mg i went to install and  right off the bat need another 50 or so mg.  then reading how i need to install more for each state....i decided to park this in the cloud.  maybe if i take a trip bit would rather use my memory for other things right now.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Wiered<br />Delina Selam the best time to play why can't we all know that you can get constipated the best time to play why can't we friends in UK and many other parts and a happy New year blog posts and a half years of line is this guy who are not the laptop
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works without flaw.  The options are wonderful and the versatility lets us each play our games our way.  Great product!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|this app is amazing!!!!!!!!I love it!!!!!! the best music app ever!!!!!! and if you said its stupid well than your stupid.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved every second! Read it three times in a row. I was pulling for Travis and Abby but also knew why they were not good for each other at times. Their relationship was very realistic, heartbreaking, and exciting. I've recommended this book to everyone I talk to! Can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out! I'm currently reading the Providence Trilogy by Jamie McGuire. Love her style of writing!!
B006OAB3ME|4.0|and why not? Another aging rocker with a false sense of humility and of history trying to cash in on the past.<br /><br />But no.<br /><br />This is not a commercial new twist on old songs. It's just the old songs done well. There is a sense of love here.  And joy in the music.<br /><br />Paul's voice is weathered smooth. His range has always been modest but he has learned control and there is surprising strength and flexibility in that familiar old voice.<br /><br />Paul always did have a soft streak and a way with a love song. And now looking back it is really not surprising that he should record these songs. And do them justice.<br /><br />Paul invites you in to share the songs. Enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app. is one of best I ever used!!! If I had to pay it would have worth it!<br />  bobcro
B0026NWBY2|4.0|I wish the compilation had included all original tracks.  Some of the live tracks were very good, but not what I was looking for.  A couple of the live tracks were mediocre.  A couple of the tracks were not my favorite George songs.<br />This is my edit, several months after my original review.  The album has grown on me...  The live cuts are nice and really give you a personal sense of George's wonderful presense.  So I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars.<br />:)
0062183591|5.0|Wow! Reading this book was like having a curtain lifted - or more accurately, having explanations provided for intuitive observations. As a business coach, I've 'known' many of the behaviors discussed, and, even how to modify or control them - what I haven't known was the \\"why.\\"  Dan Ariely uses humor sprinkled with recent world events and innovative experiments to at least scratch the surface of the mysteries of the world of morality.  In my opinion, this is indispensible reading for those of us in the service of helping others be the best they can be - and, for having some understanding of the irrationality of why we often aren't!
0785153373|2.0|The quality of the paperback editions is terrible. The printing quality is fine, but the paper weight is horrendous. It is thin and flimsy (both the covers and interior pages) and the books collapse under their own weight because of this. You can't hold the books up to read without them flopping and curling over. I'm afraid to handle them because I fear I will tear the tissue-thin pages! I've had plenty of paperback how-to books that are about the same size (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Photographic Journal, the Making of the Indiana Jones Movies are the most recent ones I got) and bigger, and they are much more sturdy as they are made with a heavier cover and interior pages stock.<br /><br />My advice is to spring for the hardcover editions even though they are much more expensive. The paperbacks are very disappointing since they are practically impossible to handle.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Though I respect the plot of this movie and the message it was attempting to communicate (the complex and often very sad reality of drug and alcohol abuse/addiction), I was disappointed with the movie at large.  Though very much a part of the reality of these lifestyles, the nudity and very direct inclusion of pornographic references was way too much, even for a rated-R movie.  Denzel Washinton is usually such a classy actor and this felt more slimy than anything of his I have to watch yet.  I think the graphic nature of the movie drove the point home, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't want lingering images in their minds.
B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|Loved the original Fright Night years ago, so I was worried when I heard they were doing a re-make.  You usually don't end up with anything decent when redoing an old classic.  However I found this re-do very enjoyable.  It managed to keep the original's basic elements while modernizing the tail for the 21st century.  I think it even managed to carve out some territory of its own, and of course Dr. Who fans will love the new P. Vincent.  Fun, flashy, scary at times, and with a touch of humor this new age fright will make your night.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A wonderful, poignant sweet read about actually paying attention to EVERYthing in your life. I cried and laughed and highly recommend this book.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|I liked the general premise and this film had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately it spent more than half of its life in a very slow build up and finally concluded with a very tepid exorcism-climax.  Lacking any real thrills and chills and only shallowly treading over well traveled material I can't say I really liked this movie.  Still neither can I say that I wasted 90 minutes of my time and that I wasn't at all entertained.  What I will say is that I won't watch the movie again, and will recommend far meatier fair to anyone wanting a possession/exorcist type movie.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I've read quite a few of Crichton's books, and this is a good one, but not his best. It's kind of &#34;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&#34; cast as a horror film with Big Business as the big creature. Fun, but not great.
B002IJ9YR6|5.0|I will watch this over and over! Enjoyable, fun, quirky, well acted, andNO violence! Characters are believable too, well cast.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I knew that this was a great movie,  and now I am very happy that I own it.  It was just what I expected.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Another page turner by Rollins! Loved it! One question: Who is the woman at the end? Maybe we'll never know...
B007ZUTOC8|3.0|All fine. I just didn't realise that the book came without a dust cover. Not a problem as such but I cant remember it being mentioned in the item description.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a very good book, but the Katniss attitude is starting to annoy me. I know she is just a teenager but she is too inconsistent. Time for her to grow up.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great read by Clancy.  Sometimes to close to reality for comfort.  Some of the plot is lile reading the daily headlines.
B00BF2UKDE|4.0|I'll be upfront about this: while I like when Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds cut loose and fills some poor sap with lead (MURDER BALLADS remains one of my all-time favorite albums, of any artist from any genre), I'm more partial to their melancholy work.  THE BOATMAN'S CALL is simply a beautiful album; same with NOCTURAMA, even if the songs on it don't stand up with his best.<br /><br />PUSH THE SKY AWAY is comparable to both of these latter albums.  Ironically, the album's best and worst moments come in the same tune: \\"Higgs Boson Blues.\\"  One moment, Cave croons, \\"Robert Johnson and the devil, man/Don't know who's gonna rip off who.\\"  The next, he's referencing Hannah Montana (twice!).  This idiosyncrasy is what irks me the most about SKY: at times, it feels like Cave didn't quite know what he wanted to write, and so just put something down, throwing it off as an artistic non sequitur.<br /><br />Those moments abound here.  They don't last long--not one song here is completely unlistenable; and face it, Cave has given us some of those during his career--and they're mostly overshadowed by the artistry we hear elsewhere.  Cave's poetry is in fine form; he manages to be brooding, threatening, subtle, outlandish, and romantic all at once: \\"She was a catch/We were a match/I was the match that would fire up her s*****.\\"  The album culminates in the beautiful title track.  When Cave sings \\"Some people say it's just rock and roll/Ah, but it gets you right down to your soul,\\" he's not just reiterating something we've heard other, lesser artists say; he's speaking a universal truth.  Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds aren't for everyone, and their albums tend to be about as diverse as you can get.  But PUSH AWAY THE SKY is up there among Cave's better recent efforts.  A thoroughly beautiful, haunting, poetic album.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Best album yet. Has an 80s/90s sound that really works well. This is a great album for people who haven't heard Tegan and Sara yet. Everyone should own this!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|great price and a great gift  The movie has a great lesson to be learned as well.  My kids loved the movie
0062238310|5.0|Fellowes adds a great deal of backstory through his plentiful notes. (Who would have guessed that Molesley and Bates were footmen together before the Boer war?)  It is also so fun to read (the many) lines which were cut from the broadcast of the US AND UK episodes. The missing lines add a level of depth to the original storyline and it is fun to see what some of the B characters would have said if they had not been limited by time.  I'm a geek for endnotes, so I love it. People who aren't very thrilled with flipping back and forth between the script and the notes might not be as charmed by the format (Although the Kindle format (the only format I've seen) makes it very simple to go from text to notes and back). Hardcore Downton fans will love this.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I Gotta Say The Past Metallica Albums Haven't Been That Great. The Black Album, Load, And Reload Are My Favorites. I Got This Cd And I Wasn't Sure If Id Like It. After Listening To It I Was Pretty Amazed. All Nightmare Long, Cyanide, Day That Never Comes Were Really Great Songs. Although My Favorite Would Have To Be The Unforgiven 3. That May Possibly The Best Rock/Metal Song I've Heard Since Slipknots Wait And Bleed :) The First Two Unforgiven Songs Were Okay, But The Third One..Wow. also The Song Suicide And Redemption, A 10 Minute Long Song Instrumental Only Is Really Impressive. The Fact Someone Could Play That Fast For That Long Period Of Time, Is Just Beyond Me. Lol. So It's A Great Cd Go Buy It you'll Love It :)
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I ordered this classic album for my little sister for christmas. She's 12 but I think the album went over really well with her.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love this show, I wish we could watch season 4 sooner.<br />I cant wait to continue this series.<br />Devoted Fan
B008K9SG9K|3.0|Over all the cd is structured nicely.  I heard Radioactive and really liked the dubstep/electro feel to it.  However, the rest of the cd has more of an indie pop feel to it.  Also, i hear tip toe all the time and hate that style, didn't realize it was imagine dragons
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a game for all ages. you need to think but can play slow to teach kids. I find this a great relaxation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good.  You fall in love with the main characters immediately.  I read this straight through...couldn't put it down.
B004F1F32A|5.0|I watched this movie again before watching Taken 2.  I loved it as much this time as I did the first. I love Liam Neeson and loved his part in the movie. Fun and action packed!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for horse lover's like myself, it teaches people how to car for horses and it is almost just like a real life horse! But guess what,  it has UNICORNS!!!!
B00498YZFK|5.0|Having just seen Silver Linings Playbook (Jennifer Lawerence's performance deserves an Oscar), I was curious to see Lawrence's earlier work in a movie that had been otherwise very well received. As for Lawrence, I think we have a next big thing on our hands! She's truly a natural!<br />That being said, I thought the idea for the movie was brilliant! And well executed. The children playing Lawrence's siblings really warmed my heart. My caring for them really set the stakes for the main struggle of Lawrence's character throughout. Basically, their father goes missing, and if not ultimately accounted for, Lawrence's character, her invalid mother, and siblings would lose their house.<br />Set in an extremely rural setting, Lawrence's character is seen passing on to her little brother and sister how to do certain things to survive, like how to cook, shoot a rifle, and prepare squirrel having just been killed.<br />The main drive of the film is the unsettling journey Lawrence's character must take in search for her missing father.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed this well done film!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Didn't like this one!  I thought it was way too much drama for 17 and 18 year olds, as I put in my rating weeks ago
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really liked this game. it has great graphics and a good story line. but for the money it cost I thought the game could have lasted a little bit longer.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Loved the action and special effects. Villain was the best in ages, Bond was as good as ever, just older!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Been playing this app on my iPod touch for a long time and have been waiting for it to come out on the Amazon app store for a while now. Downloaded once I saw it was available but it wouldn't let me log in to Facebook, saying some odd message. If this happens for you, you probably have the Facebook app on your Kindle.<br /><br />To get it to work, follow these steps:<br />Delete your Facebook app from your Kindle (don't worry, you can get it back later).<br />Go to the Jurassic Park Builder app and log in using your Facebook information (this time it should let you play).<br />You can then download the Facebook app again and everything should now work okay without any problems.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|So much fun to watch. So superbly crafted. So brilliantly conceived. This whole series stands up to repeat viewings. It's wonderful.
1401216676|3.0|It just does not live up to the hype. I heard it was one of the best batman comics ever written, it isn't. Right now, I'm on a Batman kick and I've read a lot the graphic novels considered to be great, The Dark Knight Returns, Year One, Hush, Long Halloween, and Dark Victory. They all lived up to the hype and they were all amazing. This one however, is not.<br /><br />It's incredibly short, the dialogue is actually pretty bad, and the story is just okay. The only thing I liked about it is the Joker's intensity. Very disappointing.
B002AFX52S|4.0|Such an amazing cinematic experience. It feels &#34;live action.&#34; It felt like it unfolded in front of me in real time. So heart felt. So amazing.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|Sound and picture were excellent.  This movie shows how people from different walks of life and beliefs can work together to solve a problem
B008NEVP1S|4.0|I love Aimee's sophisticated pop sensibility, perfectly executed in this collection of songs. Wonderful. Bright. Incisive. I love the sweet hooks in her melodies.
0857685848|4.0|This book pretty much repeats what has already published, therefore I am disappointed.  The art work is gorgeous although it does not organize what the artists have depicted.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is an excellent series.  Who doesn’t love post-apocalyptic survival stories? The flow of the story-line and character evolution is outstanding. If you enjoy sci-fi, Falling Skies is a must see.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Good storyline, but too much background noise made it hard at times to follow dialogue.  Would probably be better in a movie theater than on home TV.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fairly easy, but nice graphics and good story with good hints...it could use a few more puzzles and a few less hidden items,,. But fun.
1451662432|2.0|---Just finished reading Total Recall, guarded is understated, let's try boring, (consequently taking forever to read) un-interesting and intellectually dishonest. I just find it difficult to believe a guy coming over here in the middle of a firestorm of racism (The civil rights movement) and civic upheaval (The Vietnam war) even 911, didn't even acknowledge those events and how it impacted his life. He did mention 911 in passing. --- I actually love Arnold, his movies, work ethic and politics. I actually went on to buy his other books (the encyclopedia of modern bodybuilding and the education of a bodybuilder) however Total Recall is bloated with details and bios of everyone he ever met or worked with, which quite frankly, the reader doesn't care about! ---Not that I was looking for a tell all, no wonder the book is over 600 pages! The chapter titled \\"the secret\\" where he vaguely talks about his mistress whom he ultimately gets pregnant; He doesn't really say how it happened or why, I suspect he wants the reader to use their own imagination! The only thing he really details is his early years in body building, how he got into the movies, his relationship with Sarge and Eunice Shriver in addition to his governorship. I really wanted to like the book, couldn't wait to get a copy, unfortunately, I have no desire to read its contents ever.<br /><br />I will concede that his last chapter containing \\"Arnold's rules\\" gave me something to take with me. Sorry Arnold...
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love this game. It is as good as the first one. I play it over and over. I hope there will be another one. Happy playing
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The movie was entertaining.  It really didn't do justice to the original TV series, but it was entertaining.  I would recommend it if you're a Johnny Depp fan.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This app really challenges the player to put together clues and solve the puzzle.  When the player solves each puzzle, the elevator door opens  and brings you to the next floor and a whole new puzzle to solve.  It is fun, challenging and (so far) my favorite app. Try it, you won't be sorry! I am eagerly awaiting new floors to escape from!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The movie was great, but it froze up when there was about 20 minutes left. It finally just closed the movie, but by then the movie had expired. I was then forced to have to rent it again to watch the end of the movie. I am unsure if I want to rent another movie for fear of it happening again.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|I am a Belkin n52te gamepad user looking for something QUIETER for gaming.  The Belkin has fewer keys , fewer options and is very simple to use.  In some games (like Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2) simple is definitely better.  I am used to the shape of the Belkin pad and the layout.  Other than a straight replacement for it (and the keys get loud as they are worn, so that wasn't much of an option), the Logitech G13 was the only one I saw which MIGHT do the job.<br /><br />And it sort of did.<br /><br />I loved the software for the G13.  It was simple, intuitive and instantly applied (and saved) all the changes to the profile.  The keys were quiet and generally responsive.  The LCD display had a lot of great things one could check on with the push of a button, and profiles can be loaded from the device rather than manually changing them as the Belkin device makes me do (despite its supposed auto-changing feature which I never got to work).  From these aspects, the Logitech G13 is CLEARLY superior to the Belkin and had it been as easy to actually USE as the Belkin, it would have been my game pad today.<br /><br />The problems I encountered were primarily with the physical form of the device itself.  It's much longer (requiring more hand to use), and flatter.  I'm more used to the shorter (three as opposed to four rows of keys)  and narrower (five, five, four as opposed to seven, six, five, three) keys per row.  Maybe a more dedicated gamer has more sensitivity to the different key sizes and shapes for knowing which key you're on, but I work with my hands a lot and don't have as much of a finer touch sensitivity as others.  I kept pressing the wrong keys.<br /><br />Another thing I did NOT like was the way the directional &#34;joystick&#34; worked.  The Belkin has a flat button top on the &#34;joystick&#34; that can be removed leaving behind four rocker buttons, giving the gamer more control over which direction they go.  The directional controls for the Logitech are supposed to be the keys which I tend to use strictly for skills and targeting.  I'm not used to using keys for direction with the Belkin, and in attacking and other things where attack and movement are done simultaneously (which isn't the norm for most games, but is what one can do - and HAS TO DO to stay alive - in GuildWars 2) using keys to both move and attack makes one hand do too much work.  Using the thumb to move and the keys for skills and to switch targets is better for me.  Using the joystick on the Logitech was extremely frustrating because the amount of movement needed to initiate the direction was too great and the direction I went too subject to the movement of my other fingers as I switched targets and used skills.  I ran around like a head without my chicken a lot when I wasn't standing there getting hit while the joystick moved enough to get my character actually moving again.<br /><br />In short, I died a lot in situations I replayed with the Belkin where I didn't come close to dying.  I even did it backwards, replaying situations with the Logitech that I successfully played with the Belkin.  I died with the Logitech.  With the Belkin, I didn't.  Familiarity with the Belkin versus the Logitech was certainly a factor.  I could have spent longer than two days working with it to give it a fairer shake, of course.  However, I want to proceed in the game and got somewhat tired of becoming one with the earth and spending almost a full gold (for those who play the game, you know how much that is!) just repairing my armor after getting killed.  I could probably have gotten over it (assuming I didn't go bankrupt staying in armor), but there was one last issue which was the deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />The Logitech is too flat and too long for me, and my hands are NOT small.  My hand kept slipping out of place, even when I redid the entire profile to suit my reflexes just like they are in the Belkin.  My hand would not stay in place.  The palm rest is too slick and I have nothing to grip as I used it.  This made it too difficult to use.  I was focusing more on keeping my hand in place than I was on what was going on in the game.<br /><br />Again, familiarity will likely help the dedicated gamer.  For me, I'll have to do some serious modifications to its shape and joystick before I have any chance of using it as well as the Belkin.<br /><br />In the end, the keys WERE quieter and the software and features were definitely superior to the Belkin.  I'm not going be returning it because basically it works the way it's supposed to.  Unfortunately, the physical shape and much more complicated layout of the Logitech just doesn't work for me, so it will be my back-up gamepad.  I'll just have to get used to my wife complaining about how loud the buttons are.  For someone used to it, or with a different physical set-up and gaming preferences, I'd say definitely give this a try.  But if you're transitioning from something less complicated to this, definitely proceed with caution.ick and I have nothing to grip as I used it.  This made it too difficult to use.  I was focusing more on keeping my hand in place than I was on what was going on in the game.<br /><br />Again, familiarity will likely help the dedicated gamer.  For me, I'll have to do some serious modifications to its shape and joystick before I have any chance of using it as well as the Belkin.<br /><br />In the end, the keys WERE quieter and the software and features were definitely superior to the Belkin.  I'm not going be returning it because basically it works the way it's supposed to.

B007REV4YI|1.0|This has got to be an all time low point in the history of Bond. The film starts with the \\"death\\" of Bond following a fight with his arch enemy and a fall down a waterfall (sounds familiar?). Once he comes back to life all thoughts of having a storyline are quickly forgotten as the film replays a series of set action sequences which are basically copied from the Die Hard films. Bond is fairly useless in these sequences, so it is just as well that he faces a equally useless opponent. Thousands of bullets fly but magically miss the villain of the film, despite him being targeted at point blank range. The last half hour provides some light relief as it is based on Home Alone, just not as well done. The villain is finally slain due to him somehow forgetting to wear a bullet proof vest, a serious omission if you are going to a shoot out party. How could anyone could think that this is a quality film? Bond used to be full of fun and always won the day, now he is a rather pathetic loser who is not sure what film he is in.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the best game ever right behind subway suffers and temple run just have to say my favoritei wish they would make a new one or update it
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Love this! I was at the '73 concert at another location and this is like reliving it. Great dvd! All the classic Led Zep songs and footage of the band. A must for all Zep fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Man, this game is great! I love the idea of surviving on a deserted island(sort of deserted). its fun and addicting! love it!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Do it again!!!<br />This chick is bad !!<br />Hard rock and power ballads . Reminds me of Lita Ford but better.
1439170916|5.0|Though technical at times the book reads almost likes a biography. Extremely interesting and holding your attention. Knowing that this killer will affect your life, or that of yours, makes this a \\"must read\\". Better to know what is known, or not, about him. This helps you to defend from his attacks, or at least, what might work or not, and why.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|A little silly but still enjoyable. I think the future episodes will be more interesting and thought provoking. I like the characters.
B000003EPN|5.0|Listening online, I thought it the best I'd ever heard Tucker as listed in this ad.  So it was really Kraus!!!  I should have known as I have a Rigoletto with Tucker who I call a foghorn.<br /><br />I heard Moffo in concert and she was just amazing.  Merrill and Flagello...yummy!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good number of apps. Nice handy design. Great content available with Amazon Prime membership. Kids are loving it...! Perfect gift!!!
B001CDR1FG|5.0|I always liked this version. This movie portrays aspects that are left out of the futre version. Wish there was more to this franchise.
B00BHMEALA|3.0|What do these have in common?<br /><br />Both generated great gobs of money, both represent a dramatic distortion of the truth, both take another significant chunk out of American credibility.<br /><br />It is bad enough that a majority of America receives its education (17th or lower in world ranking) from movies, in Argo's case  \\"based on a declassified true story\\". When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA - according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that \\"there was not enough time to fit it all in\\".<br /><br />In other words, for Ben, making the Americans \\"centre of the universe\\" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp - which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport - not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel.<br /><br />Dramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers.<br /><br />Ben in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised-face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie - nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years.<br /><br />No doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow. There is no defense, however, for the damage inflicted on the historical record, those who buy into that distortion, or the Canadians, and the lives of six US hostages whose lives depended on real intervention by real people.<br /><br />Ziek / bamfrmcan
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|Good thriller. Keeps you guessing. It was worth watching.<br />I would recommend this to a friend. Especially to those who like<br />Supernatural Thrillers.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I love the variety of games. The only thing I did not like was the whole alien thing. Seemed kind of overboard and weird.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Excellent.  Very bright.  It does its job well when there is complete dark due to power outage.  You can even read the book in its light.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|It's a pretty fun game, but some of the combinations don't make sense to me. There are only 390 things that you can make and I have had it a night and only discovered 151 of them.. I will probably continue to play it, but probably not often.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i have always liked this game. it will test you. this game is for all ages. i would recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator with a few nice extra features.  It's Very easy to use. Couldn't ask for a better calculator app.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|this is a fun game. it will test your skills. i play it all the time. i would recommend this game to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In my opinion, this one is better than the first temple run. I love the gems for save mes.. not more resurection wings, and that it automatically brings up a head start button when you have enough coins. I also love the mine and how you ride in the cart.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I really enjoyed reading all three of these books.  As usual once i saw the movies they didn't give it justice.  Really well written, couldn't put it down.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great experience that makes us think about the life after life. Well written book, easy to read. It took me 5 hours to read it all - couldn't stop
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Better than the old films in style, but missing the mark in having England's top spy fighting a psychotic ex-agent.
B00006FXB6|5.0|There's live songs and studio filming of some songs being recorded both with Grohl.  You can really feel his drumming presence in the live songs and even the studio ones.  I read Josh saying that this album is about the trip from L.A. to the desert.  The band is from Palm Desert right next to Palm Springs.  Ironically, the first time I ever hear this album was on a warm afternoon, driving alone from San Diego to Temecula.  It lasted about exactly the hour or so it took to drive there and each song unfurled in the album context of being on the radio and the incredibility of the songs just blew my mind.  It really was perfect for such a trip.  Time always can tell if an album rules or not and time has proven to these ears that this album stands way above most others.  I rushed out and bought 2 or 3 of their other albums and none that I've purchased, before or since this album or the Desert Sessions one I got have come close to the quality of this one.  They just hit the mark on this album.  One reason is Grohl on drums.  God bless 'ya folks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting is wonderful and equally good the writing is too! Can't get enough of this,pitching a story line without vulgarity and violence.
B0052FG750|5.0|And just that.  Gives you a real straight shot of the doors as is.  No extras, no alternate takes, just the albums as they released them.  And nicely done.  I believe I can tell the difference in these being remastered as I did hear most of these albums on vinyl in the 60's and 70's.  I continue to marvel at how they can use a keyboard so effectively given that typically I find the keyboard to not really be much of a rock 'n roll instrument but they sure make it work here.  There's even a bassist on a coupla of the albums.  The sleeves are re-creations of the original album covers which is nice.  Glad I bought this.  I just happened to not have any of their albums on cd so this was the perfect item to get.  It's way more economical than the big box set they also have out.  Good job Rhino. God bless you folks and I hope Jim Morrison is in heaven, it'd be nice.  He sure was passionate.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|I could listen to Peter Gabriel's music everyday and all day.  Such a great performer and creator of amazing music.
0738212415|4.0|While this book is excellently done and it has amazed me how much I have learned in such a short time. My only problem with the book is that in Lesson 13 Bonus Challenge 2 it asked you to go to Mark's website and simply click on the video tutorial entitled \\"Deluxe House Level 2\\" well to my disappointment I did not see any such video and when I did click on one of his video lessons the said deluxe house 2 it said I had to sign up and pay to see it. That upset me a little bit because I really enjoyed to the challenges but I am not going to pay for it. I did buy the book.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|More boring than I remembered ... ... ... ... ... .. .. .. ... ... ... .. ... ..  ...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Afleck did an excellent job directing this movie<br />I stayed on the edge if my seat the entire time!
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Headhunters starts at a moderate pace, like a heist movie. It twists and turns with increasing momentum as Roger desperately and sometimes ingeniously escapes certain death. The plot is clever enough to reward repeat viewing. The direction is smooth and subtle. Action scenes are credibly brutal. And frame by frame, the movie is beautiful to look at.<br /><br />(Also, those who prefer dubbing to subtitles will be very pleased.)<br /><br />Hollywood won't be able to resist an instant remake but they can't top this. With the caution that it is a bit cold and harsh for some viewers, Headhunters is highly recommended.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|What an awesome movie!  Great story plus superb music with insightful lyrics.  I rarely purchase movies, but this one I had to have!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This is the best documentary I have ever seen on Bob Marley. The story line and cinematography are superb! I enjoyed the intimacy of telling his story from the time of his birth until his passing in 1981. I will be watching this film over and over
B006H5120E|5.0|We already had the DVD but when we purchased a new 3D television we thought it would be fun to watch Titanic in 3D.  It was excellent.  The Titanic has deepth to it and you feel like you are standing on the deck. Makes it feel even more real than it felt on a regular DVD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. Characters are all believable, reacting in a plausible fashion. Effects are first rate. Love them zombies.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Excellent film of historical events portraying rescue of Americans from Iran during hostage crisis. Afflict did a great job! A must see!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is wonderful! Great storylines. Nice reminded of how to be polite and well mannered. Don't wait like I did!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|game runs great. if you like Mario games this is very similar.  need to get this one! It is very additive. have fun playing this game.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|Merlin is an awesome show and I watch it weekly and I can't wait for all the seasons to be on Amazon
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this. My five year old will play this over and over. Easy for him to play and keeps him entertained.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Amazingly talented young lady, whose music will be enjoyed by people of all ages I imagine!  Would like to hear more of her voice but absolutely no complaints about this album.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|For those who enjoy puzzles and match games, this is very addictive.  Once you play, it's very hard to stop.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|For anyone using their phone as a primary work, gaming or personal device (or in my case, all threes) this \\"dongle\\" is great.<br /><br />I take it with me to work for quick discussions / presentations and on the road to work / play on.<br /><br />Would highly recommend.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|I really don't know how he does it.  I have read practically all of the Jack Reacher series, and I STILL like them!  I know, I know, it is not highbrow, and I should really be reading 'War and Peace' or something, but I enjoy these books!  So. this particular one - was a pretty good one, I thought.  Plenty of action, plenty of interest, intrigue, some generic bad government dudes.... great stuff. Read it, enjoy it - just don't take it too seriously.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun game.  it has a good variety of deal options and aesthetic choices.  help is available on all games to suggest moves.
B00A2YBDTQ|5.0|Mel Brook's movies are awesome. I enjoy it and will be watching it again and again.  I am going on vacation and will need something for the three hour lay over and this is it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love this series!great characters! YOu will not be sorry you started watching The Walking Dead. So much action. Never boring.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I don't even know what this product is or how I got it so I'm just gonna leave a silly message as a review, Have any of you guys heard of a game called subway surfer, you should download that game its sick. its on Play story and iOS and its free. Its super addicting too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it!  Very relaxing yet challenging at the same time.  Great way to wind down at the of the day.
B007REV4T8|5.0|James Bond is the coolest dude in the world - no matter which actor - no matter which story line.  The Bonds are classics and we own every single one of them.
0823003590|3.0|I expected another thing, the quality of the book is nice, but the content is to simple, I spected more excercises to lear draw realistics heads. It has a lot of theory to learn, but, because i like to draw, i expected more draw and examples.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Very interesting info. Have been on the diet three weeks and have lost 5 lbs. already.
B000O1799U|5.0|i love this movie. i think thats all there is too it. i love the songs, i love the drama, i love the acting, its just wonderful. awesome movie
1400052181|5.0|This was an amazing read!  Based on a true story, the author does a great job of having this read more like a novel.  Very interesting and provided many topics to discuss at book club.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Love these types of games! The only thing that really grinds my gears is the penalties during the dark flashlight portions. Other than that, don't change a thing!
0385536828|1.0|We picked this for our book club thinking it would be an intriguing novel about espionage...whoa, were we wrong! Only 2 people in our book club could even finish it and most stopped reading after 40-50 pages because of the lack or intrigue. The author is over detailed with his descriptions.  His development of the characters falls short, leaving you with no emotional connection to them.  One person brought in a review that stated something like, &#34;You must be patient with the author&#34;...well who wants to do that?  I'd rather read a book that's good all the way through instead of &#34;being patient with the author&#34; to only have an ending that's anticlimactic.
0449011151|3.0|Death Comes to Pemberley, a mystery \\"sequel\\" to Pride and Prejudice, is sure to please Jane Austen fans.  I am assuming here, since I am not a fan of Jane Austen myself.  The tone of the dialogue, the frequent musings on the marriages (or hoped-for marriages) of the various characters, the understated action and the very slow pace of the novel are all such as might have been written by Miss Austen herself.<br /><br />For me, I found the mystery decidedly flat (although I didn't expect more of a mystery based on a Jane Austen novel) and the rest of the story lacking in originality, since it seemed to consist of little more than a re-cap of the events of Pride and Prejudice.  The narrator, however, is excellent -- Rosalyn Landor's talent is impressive and it was that alone that kept me listening.
1401322425|5.0|Jaime is great. wonderful recipes and gardening tips. love how he writes about food, such passion , earthiness. it feels like you are at his house and he is telling you how to make this recipes and giving you some back ground of his own life, how he grew up.  I bought this for my hubby but I love it too.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|The movie itself was good but I thought it was very violent and bloody, I spent a lot of time closing by eyes. If you don't like extreme bloody scenes this is not the movie for you!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Learning what motivates others can be a challenging task but the author shares many helpful insights into human behavior that will benefit those of us who sell.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It has a little bit of everything for everyone... My husband loves the violence and gore where as I like the connections and survival :)
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is an awesome app!!!!!!!:D and its FREE!! I'm only 10 but I am writing horse books...:D anyway I totally recommend this 4 anyone who wants 2 write books. It's the best book writing app I've seen 4 free!! It's super easy 2 use and I have been looking 4 an app like this...again I totally recommend this app!!!!!!!!!!:D
1936608898|5.0|One of my favorite things about this book is how it describes the difference between how you feel when eating the SAD diet compared the Paleo/Primal/whole30 way.
6305603847|5.0|I've seen the movie before but only here and there, now I watch it all the time and really happy I own it.  There are versions of songs that aren't on the album that I get stuck in my head now and I can only hear with this DVD, definitely an item to have for the Pink Floyd fan.
B001BANK32|4.0|It's very good, I love how much detail it has versus the movie. There is so much more to the story. Love it!
1400049628|3.0|After struggling to get through this I realized that it is great for what it was suppose to be.  A guide. It was written like a text book and reads like a text book so job well done right?  If that was the goal then yes but ask yourself this...who reads a text book?  It was really long to get through.
0307120007|5.0|I loved this book as a child and hope my child does too!  It's a classic and allows the child to interact
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Do I really need to say anything about this? I mean c'mon, it's the walking dead.  Sooooo frikken awesome.  Bam.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|The Recipient enjoyed watching the movie and I was able to find the game that went along with it locally.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. You smile, laugh and cry along with Hazel. I relate so much with this in between girl.<br /><br />All you want to do is put the book down as you are reading it because everything hurts, hurts so much you almost can't stand it (in fact I had to stop 4 times because I was crying too hard to read) but you can't. You mustn't you owe it to the characters to know what happens. You simply must know how they turn out.<br /><br />Van Houten was wrong though, these characters live on with me. It sounds cheesy but I think of them as people because they are; they are true people who have feelings, lives and friends and I will never forget their stories.
1400052181|5.0|My book group read this as one of our books for discussion and I thought my daughter the scientist would enjoy it.  It has nothing to do with animals however so I don't understand the salutation of your message.
1449410243|5.0|Bought one for myself and one for a friend. We both loved it!  If you are a cat lover, you'll enjoy it!
B007GE2H3G|3.0|I fell asleep watching this movie, so I gave it an &#34;ok&#34; didn't get the watch the entire movie yet.. may yet be interesting, though I'm not all that hyped to watch it again.
1452110581|5.0|Bought one for myself and one for a friend. We both loved it!  If you are a cat lover, you'll enjoy it!
0812984412|1.0|I'm sorry, I just hated this book.  Actually, this was the first book I can remember in a long time that I simply couldn't bring myself to finish.  The idea was extremely intriguing, that everyone throughout the ages is connected in some way.  It seemed like a sure thing for a great book. However, the author uses cheap language tricks in order to make the timelines seem more different.  The middle story, where [spoiler alert] the main character is a valleysman on a post apocalyptic island, was so awful that I had to stop reading it.  He writes in a Caribbean style dialect that is so pathetic and confusing, that I didn't even understand what he was trying to express.  If the author can't convey a separate time/place through his change in pros, then he certainly shouldn't try to change the person's dialect to something illegible.<br />I really wanted to like this book, and tried reading it a couple time from where I stopped last, but couldn't do it.  Very disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very safe as well as fun game I reckon you should try it for yourself why not just give it a go go on you know you want to
B00BESIKWM|1.0|There's a guy standing on the side of the road and he flags down his friends to stop them from running off the washed out bridge up ahead. I'm that guy warning you not to watch this movie, the first silent hill was actually terrifying and fun, this one...well stop while your ahead.
B009M5CJI0|5.0|I've loved the first book of the triology, and really wanted to read the second one.<br />Worrying about it not fill my expectations (as many second or third parts do), I started to read it. But no, I really loved it. I think it's great how he did to manage the time in the old characters, and how he did to itroduce new ones, for example: their children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4, it was awesome! Didn't see the ending coming, shocked and loved every minute. The characters are really developed before your eyes.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Excellent special effects, no politically correct message to have to plug my nose to get through, just a well written action packed movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote.  You can organization all your notes, webpages, pics and articles you find on the internet and thing you scan you can organize with Evernote.  Plus you can sync your Evernote account with a laptop, tablet, PC or phone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My third favorite book only to catching fire and mockingjay just an awesome book i recomend to everyone just a great read
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Very good build product, really easy to assemble. I've no experience with other stands but this one does its job just perfect.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved this book!<br />Now favorite =) recommend to everyone! I was sad when i finished it. Better than the movie though the movie also made me cry
B003B02O0A|5.0|The struggles of racism continue even in today's society.  Too often people look at the outer appearance as opposed to the intent yet we turn to society to determine right from wrong.  Greatly appreciate how the Author ended the book; extremely creative!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this game. It's a wonderful challenge without being to difficult and it's easy to learn.
0321344758|4.0|As a professional, I would recommend it to everyone who needs an easy and quite complete guide to usability. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it's a bit too informal for me. But I'm italian, and maybe this perception of excessive informality is simply due to cultural differences between our countries.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This hilarious story includes enough Eagles football information to keep any reader interested, even English-major types! The details of his life, whether it be the decorated bus his Indian friends drive, the Bros B4 Hos poster, the messed-up relationship of his parents, create a clear picture of a man struggling to be whole. I suppose he was always mentally unstable, with violent tendencies that he inherited from his father, but he has to learn to live with himself.<br />I found the situation of his ex-wife at the end sort of strange. How could she still live in that house?<br />I guess I liked the book so much because I never thought a man could love a woman so much. Is that just an example of his obsessive-compulsive behavior? Is it his need to get over his guilt for what he did to Philip? Is he a &#34;different kind of person than us&#34;? But then there are examples of men being very loving to their wives, Tommy with Tiffany, Jake with Caitlin (how could Pat know she was beautiful just from the sound of her voice?) men crying. He himself has a very natural enjoyment with children, that it is natural to want to play with them, and to take care of them.<br />I think I enjoyed the relationships between the men the best. I like the way the author uses &#34;my boys&#34; and how Pat muses a lot over the times when he was a kid and how he is now. I liked the idea that he has &#34;lost&#34; 4 - 5 years, in the aftermath of his crime, and is in the process of growing up, practicing being kind instead of being right.
030746363X|5.0|I have really learned a lot of helpful and surprising information. Especially about the chemistry of why what we eat turns to fat or muscle.
B005HP2JAM|2.0|Fascinating discovery and exploration of caves with ancient drawing that really are remarkable.  But much of the 3d camera usage was dizzying to watch (camera on shoulders walking through the forest) and the movie became extremely repetitive, showing the same drawings over and over.  Kudos to the brave explorers who made this important discovery, but don't plan on sitting through the whole movie and being captivated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing bro .love it glitches up sometimes but only a little way worth it idk why anyone would put a bad review bc its so awesome
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So darn easy and available to download on my Fire, especially when I miss an episode. Smooth sailing when watching. No glitches. Bright colors and sharp features.
B00004CXYO|1.0|This movie will not play in my dvd player or my blue ray. When purchasing this dvd it did not show the format or colour as being PAL.(European format) It will only play on my laptop.
1401324649|5.0|Cute, funny, lighthearted and unique. Love this book so much I've now bought it as a gift for everyone who's had a birthday since I read it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|you and your pew pew at the pigs. they stole your eggs, but do two wrongs make a right? yes they do.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I read this after it was recommended by a number of women I know. Super tedious- romance by numbers. As soon as you're introduced to the main characters you know exactly what's going to happen.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was relieved to see that a neuroscientist had such an experience because it blows the naysayers out of the water, which is , I'm sure what God intended. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I wanted to know more about what Eben saw and heard.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This works on any touch screen device.  It is pretty close to the size of a regular pen and having 3 different size tips makes all the difference in the world depending on what you are working on.  I love this stylus.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|For people who chew through their batteries charge, you gotta have this one...You can set up the app where a  nice mellow ladies voice tells you your current charge...You can set it up to let you know at any point ; 25%......50%...etc. etc. And you can change the color of the icon to any shade.. it's looks really sharp. This thing takes a long time to calibrate but once it does, it can tell you everything about your battery health and what you use it most for. You can set up your notification to sound while reading, surfing, watching DVD s....or any time. It's a great help. It even shuts the notification off at night if you so choose. Great app..Oh yea, almost forgot. Have you ever been out some where and all of a sudden you find out that your device is a about to die? Well, not with this app.. you'll be reminded in plenty of time to hook up the charger!

I am using it to keep my basic Kindle that I received last year in a protected case but I rarely use that particular Kindle now that I have the new Kindle Fire.  It was worth the money.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Before I started reading Beautiful Disaster,I read a number of reviews describing this book as a kind of drug... Believe me,now that I actually read this book,I can't agree more with those reviewers or find a more accurate and simple description for it myself!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is an amazing,incredible book,that stirs such emotions inside you,that you can't help but feel that you are in a constant emotional roller coaster while reading it.<br />Jamie McGuire created a pair of main characters whose story will manage to stick to your mind for long after you'll finish reading this book.Abby \\"Pigeon\\" is an intricate and well built character,smart,independent and stong minded but with so many flaws on the same time that she feels real,and even if I didn't agree with her decisions or the way she thought the whole time,I understood her and could totally see her as the girl next door.<br />Travis,God Travis,what can I say about him...?So deeply troubled,so full of himself Travis but so irresistible and down to earth that I couldn't help myself but fall in love with his inner, or not so inner, child!<br /><br />Apart from the main characters,Jamie McGuire did a splendid job with her secondary ones as well.From Abby's best friend and Travis's cousin,to their families,this book has a set of characters that stay with you,that you can understand them and relate to them,that you can love,cry and hate with them.<br />As I said,Beautiful Disaster is a constant emotional roller coaster of a book!Abby's and Travis's relationship is built right in front of the reader's eyes,you witness them struggle to get what they want from their life,to built the relationship of their dreams and making the one mistake after the other and the whole time you are with them,eager to see how the story unfolds,how they are going to straighten up every new mess they create!I just loved this book.I loved the way it made me feel and the fact that while I'm writing this review almost two weeks after I finished it,I still remember everything about it clearly!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is an incredible contemporary novel you will either hate or love,there's no compromise about it.This story will either drag you down its path or make you want to bang your head with the protagonists' decisions.Either way,everyone should totally read it!And while I'm at it,thanks to Giota once more for insisting to read this book ASAP!ter I finished it,I still remember everything about it clearly!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is an incredible contemporary novel you will either hate or love,there's no compromise about it.This story will either drag you down its path or make you want to bang your head with the protagonists' decisions.Either way,everyone should totally read it!And while I'm at it,thanks to Giota once more for insisting to read this book ASAP!

It can or could make your blood pressure raise!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Whoever the reviewer is who's demanding to know where the editor was when these books were published...I'll conceed that the author overuses her descriptives, but the story itself isn't THAT bad.  I do wish she hadn't written it in 1st person, but otherwise there's a solid tale there, not only within each book, but throughout the trilogy.  As James is a 1st time author I can only say this...GOOD JOB!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Thought it was a well thought out movie. I love Denzel in just about every movie he is in and this one is no exception. I thought the plane crash really looked real and it makes you think.... Who's flying the plane, what condition are they in when they go to fly. Hopefully not like this one and then again maybe so as he knew what to do and how to do it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Again, good job James.  In the future I would suggest moving away from 1st person, but otherwise she had a story to tell and I think she did a good job with it.  For those who read it and were turned off by the S & M....what where you expecting?  It's no secret that these books were filled with strong sexual content and aspects not considered mainstream...don't pick it up, buy it, read or skim it if you don't like erotica or the ilk...just my opining though.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|I was stunned! honestly stunned. Firstly, the film really made me admit that you cannot get an entire idea of a film by just viewing a trailer, well yeah! the trailer may just seem to give you the impression that you are about to witness just another gore movie combined with some black comedy, but as a matter of fact, this film offers much more and turns out to be a genuine gem. Everything from the screenplay, direction to the cast performances are fantastically executed. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk, wow! the presence of these two are just enough to draw you to the entire story, everything from their chemistry to their interactions are so believable that you really care for them throughout the film. Overall, this film is a genuine entertainment blended perfectly with horror and humor both. Definitely one of the best, 2010 has offered.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I want everything they've ever recorded.  Love their voices, love their take on classics.  It feels like I'm sitting next to them as they sing - not like they are in a giant studio cranking out songs.  It's my favorite Christmas album of this year.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I was very unsure about downloading this app at first because of so many poor reviews about the keyboard not working, but I gave it a try anyway. But after some tinkering, I found it to work flawlessly on both my Nexus 10 and my Galaxy S3.  All you have you know about the keyboard is to be sure to turn off predictions to get it to work.  I would love it if/when this gets fixed, but it's hardly a show stopper.  And if that is an issue for you, it's easy enough to turn them back on when you are finished using the software.  For the ability to connect to my laptop or desktop from any place in the world, it's well worth the $16.99 / year.  Nuf said...

B0002O7XWC|1.0|The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.<br /><br />It seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.<br /><br />There is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the \\"trip\\" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.<br /><br />As I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.<br /><br />konengbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.

B004T0XYM8|5.0|With over 400 some reviews already, my review will be mercifully brief.  As a lover of western films, I found Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time...\\" to be a masterpiece - perhaps his best western ever, as I am sure he intended it to be.  From the opening frame to the very end, this film is a mysterious puzzle, gripping, violent, and epic in it's scope.  I guarantee the viewer will not be able to project the ending, he will be trying to fit all the pieces together just as I did.<br /><br />Essentially, this is story of a \\"man with no name\\" (Charles Bronson) carrying of all things a harmonica (why a harmonic one asks???), who by chance befriends an infamous gunslinger (Jason Robards) to help a beautiful (former) prostitute, (Claudia Cardinale) newly married and suddenly widowed, from the gun of a cold-blooded killer (Henry Fonda), who works for a crippled and dying railroad baron (Gabriele Ferzetti).  Confusing? - you bet - that was the masterful intention of Director Leone, and he achieved his purpose most assuredly.  This film has more twists and turns than a roller coaster, which makes it such a treat to watch.  Believe me, this is not a laid-back western you can saunter into the kitchen to get another drink or a bowl of popcorn - not hardly! On the contrary, every scene is important to the plot, and the viewer is literally riveted to the screen trying desperately to understand what happening.<br /><br />I'm not about to give away the ending, but suffice to say that the ending finally brings everything into focus, and the intentions of all are revealed.<br /><br />Filmed partially in Utah and in Monument Valley, this film is a visual feast, with vast arid landscapes that define the great west.  Sergio Leone, known for his iconic close-ups of the faces of his characters, uses the close-up to build tension and effect.  His close-ups are every bit as epic as Monument Valley.  One can count the pores on the actors faces!<br /><br />Leone pays tribute to many different westerns in this film, including The Searchers, The Commancheros, High Noon, The Iron Horse, Warlock, How the West Was Won, and many others.  Leone made only one other western after this film, \\"My name is Nobody\\", again starring Henry Fonda.<br /><br />At 2 and 1/2 hours, this film is an undertaking, but well worth the effort, for watching it is like watching a master at the peak of his craft.  Warning:  Not suitable for children viewers.<br /><br />konesterns in this film, including The Searchers, The Commancheros, High Noon, The Iron Horse, Warlock, How the West Was Won, and many others.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I didn't have to do missions this whole time. And if some of the missions took me out of the game to do things like this. The prices for some of the buildings is a bit on the ridiculous side. I got a mission early on in the game to build a theater and with all the other buildings I had to buy there was a considerable wait time to purchase the theater.<br />Besides those issues the game runs smoothly.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|One of my favorite movies gets a 3D upgrade? Sign me up! Pretty excited to see this show up; and picked it up immediately. First thing that became apparent is that the film is GRAINY--to the point that my wife, who hardly notices the differences between DVD and Bluray,, commented immediately, and assumed the movie was defective. Any time there was a dark scene, you could almost COUNT the grain particles--it it literally one of the worst Bluray transfers I have ever seen. Shame on Paramount for letting this go out in this condition. The 3d itself is fine, particularly in the final half hour (which is very bright, so no grain showing up). Overall, somewhat disappointing release. Would have only gotten 2 stars, but Kelly McGillis adds one more.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  He misses this show so much!  He has been exstatic to see this again!  AND it was a great deal!

B008Y6TD5A|3.0|Russell Crowe always does a good job and his movies are always worth watching. This was no exception, except that the plot required a great leap of faith. The whole plot of this movie just seemed improbable, while still being entertaining.

B001XVD21Y|4.0|This was a pretty good movie with many twists in the plot. It kept me guessing until the end and the end comes in a very, very surprising fashion.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Although too sexually graphic for my taste, an interesting lush production of Henry VIII's personal and professional life.  Annoyingly historically inaccurate in places (for example, Cardinal Wolsey did not commit suicide while confined to the Tower, but actually died of illness in a monastery just prior to being arrested...always a master of timing).  Nonetheless presents a compelling overview of the passions and politics of the era.  Touches upon the terror his daughters must have experienced as they were in and out of favor, promised in marriage to various and sundry suitors, then had promises reneged.  Beautifully staged and costumed with a magnificent cast of actors.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Wow! Ben Affleck does a great job here, both in acting and directing. This is a real &#34;edge of your seat&#34; action drama. Characters were well developed and although we knew the outcome to this piece of history I found myself glued to watching this drama unfold. Nothing short of a great movie.

This is a lower key easy listening CD that is very relaxing and worth purchasing if a fan. Some people have written somewhat negative reviews because it is not his usual classical arias, but that really doesn't merit a negative rating. Andrea Bocelli excels in his musicality and I always look forward to the next cd.

I'm already on the 5th episode after only a few days. I can't stop watching it! I am already looking forward to getting Season 3 and beyond. It's not for the kids so I suggest watching it after they go to bed but it is riveting. Lots of suspense and a little well placed humor make Dexter one of the best shows on TV. I don't subscribe to Showtime, mainly because it is not appropriate for my kids the majority of the time, so I am grateful to be able to get it here. I wish it were a little cheaper to buy but it is well worth the money!

0061692034|5.0|First, let me say that those who complain about length are right: this book is about 60-100 pages too long.  There were times when the narrator, Dell Parsons, went on too long about characters we never really see again (Charley Quarters) or when he repeated himself extensively.  (This is particularly noticeable at the beginning of each chapter, when he refers to what he just told a reader in the previous chapter).<br /><br />Yet, despite the length, I loved every sentence of this book.  Ford has an incredible ability to conjure a world out of small turns of phrase or images such as an open house during the late summer, a line of traffic outside a State Fair, a snowfall outside a diner.  He also is excellent at illuminating characters and their movements to keep a reader compelled.  I wanted to know them better and to know what became of them after I finished the book.<br /><br />Moreover, this is a very American novel.  It does an effective job showing a reader the boundaries (real and imagined) individuals test in each day, each interaction.  It is as good as anything I've read recently.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|First I like Gordon Levitt, two I relived my heavy metal phase from high school, this movie is hard to classify, Is he a good guy or somewhere in between? its up to the viewer A movie not for kids not for kids!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I am not familiar with the author but Ms. Diffenbaugh wrote a beautiful book of prose. The characters in the story were interesting and easy to follow.<br />The story line was smooth and flowed as easily as rose petals on velvet.<br />Her stories behind the flowers and how they were interpreted in the Victorian era were well.....almost magical.<br />Give yourself a treat and sit down with a cup of coffee or tea and open this lovely book.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's a high brow soap but very entertaining. Photography, location, acting, etc. all make it a first rate production. The characters are interesting and the individual episodes usually include what is going on with just about every character. And it is cool that Dame Maggie Smith gets all the zingers!

B00BESKTMG|2.0|I love martial art movies! I grew up watching them. So needless to say I was looking forward to seeing what 'Man with the Iron Fists' had to offer. It gave me squat. RZA, lead rapper of Wu-Tang Clan, decided to be actor, narrator, director, screen writer and composer for this movie. It might not have been so bad if he had stayed off the screen. RZA, the man with the iron fist, is not leading man material. He can't act, the Asian actors spoke english better than him, and I spent the whole movie saying, &#34;Huh?, what did he say?&#34; The martial arts was mediocre and it's a shame talent such as Russell Crowe and Lucy Lu was wasted. You don't care about RZA's character at all and instead of cheering for him you end up wishing someone would put him out of his misery or put you out of yours. Don't bother with this, instead go watch some better martial arts movies such as Anything Else! :(

B0054X3FQO|5.0|\\"Treasure Yourself, Power Thoughts For My Generation\\" was a title that caught my attention while I was recently trying to decide what to read next.  I must by honest, I had no idea who Miranda Kerr was so I did what came naturally and I researched her on the internet.  Ok, she is a supermodel; \\"well this should be interesting\\", I thought to myself.  I was right.<br />I am not sure what I expected but I certainly didn't expect to be \\"enlightened\\" by a supermodel; yet I was and I even regret the slight sarcasm in that statement.  Miranda Kerr has written a book that is not only inspirational but also enlightening.  Assuming that a supermodel isn't \\"real\\" like us is a mistake made by most.  This book will not only give a few glimpses into the life of a supermodel, but you will find that you too have learned some valuable lessons about life in general by the time you reach the last page.<br /><br />Miranda Kerr has done a wonderful job of sharing her stories and the lessons she has learned in her own life.  Don't be fooled, she has not had the easiest life.  She has experienced loss, hard times, pain and rejection just like you and me.  Yes I said rejection.  Of course she is a beautiful sought after model, but she experienced her share of painful rejection to get where she is today.  Even before she was a model, Miranda Kerr experienced the same insecurities and struggles that many young girls go through every day.  Miranda Kerr is a supermodel because society has given her the title, but in reality she is a well rounded, inspirational, loving young woman with a lot more to share with young people and the world.<br /><br />I am a 42 year old woman and naturally while I read this book I came across lessons that I have already learned; but I certainly wish that someone like Miranda Kerr had been around in my younger days sharing her wisdom with me.  Now that I have said that, I was also struck by the lessons that this young woman taught me regardless of my age.  We all know that beauty comes from within, but when she discussed the \\"decision to be beautiful\\" I experienced my own Oprah \\"aha\\" moment.<br /><br />The stories and affirmations that Miranda Kerr shares in her book were wonderful but this is also beautiful book, literally.  The book is full of beautiful drawings of flowers and butterflies and pictures of her journey through life.  I found myself smiling often and I have been touched by Miranda Kerr to say the least.  I may not be of her generation, but I am still open to lessons that anyone is willing to teach and Miranda Kerr certainly taught me a few lessons.  If you have a young woman in your life, share this book with her, but don't forget to read it first.  My copy is in the mail to my 21 year old daughter now.<br /><br />I was not financially compensated for this post. I received the book from Hay House for review purposes. The opinions are completely my own based on my experience.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I love this DVD set. It's the best I've bought in recent years and it has great behind the scene footage. Would recommend this set to a film student or someone who works in the film industry.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Cute, fun game. It doesn't have any annoying pop-up ads and it's pretty addicting. On the downside, I do wish there was a way to earn some gems without paying. If that problem were fixed, the game would be much better!<br /><br />There's also alot of waiting, but it worth it to get your dragon. I wish there was a way to add friends without needing a facebook account.<br /><br />The game has in-app purchases, and since it doesn't force you to buy them, it makes it all the more tempting to buy gems. You can breed together dragons to get a few of the ones that cost gems.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's a really fun game for people of all ages and I recommend that you get it!
B0019IB0II|5.0|I think that all health care people should read this book, it gives them insight as how to treat them,and  to be patient.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't help myself. I've watched every 11th doctor episode so far. Love Doctor Who and Matt Smith. Definitely worth a watch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is sooooooo awesome everyone should play it BEST APP EVER!!!!!<br />Loving it!<br />  You know not every day you find a game this good if you have not purchased this game GET IT
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game reminds me of tanagrams except there are many more shapes that fit into the picture and the pictures are really nice.  It's the best jigsaw puzzle game I've played on the Kindle Fire so far.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Hands down the best movie of the year. It was funny, sad,happy. Everything at once. They did a very good job brining it over from a book to the big screen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I never wanted to put it down. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book , can't wait to read another one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome me and my cousin always play it. It is so worth getting. It's so cool running  through trains and running away from a police . It's my favorite game to play I would get don't even think twice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I enjoyed this set of games so much that I upgrade to  Pinball Deluxe Premiun, then deleted this version because I didn't need it anymore. but it was great.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have put out an album that makes me dance, cry, laugh and feel. I am super proud of these local men!
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Pinball Deluxe free and I liked it so well I purchased Pinball deluxe premium It a great set of pinball games.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Flight was an amazing movie with a very powerful message indeed. Denzel knocks it outta the box once more with aanother amazing performance. He stands as one of the best actors of my generation.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was an OK book. Somethings were drawn out and others not followed up with. Maybe that means there is another book on the way. I probably won't see the movie, they are never as good as the books.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Hands down it will take home the golden trophy on Oscar night. Ben Affleck should have been nominated for best director and I think the academt now realizes they fumbled the ball in the red zone. It was really a good movie that clocked in at 2 hours 23 minutes but you don't even know because it was that entertaining. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were awesome. An instant classic.
B001EBWITA|5.0|If good versus evil with Catholic undertones films that aren't horror films is your fancy then this is the film for you.<br /><br />This film is very visual alluring like V for Vendetta but more searching the Bible for clues to end of days. I liked all the characters.  They felt very well-developed.  I am a sucker for Keanu Reeves playing the hero.<br /><br />I just find this film very artistic, good versus evil comic book film.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Amazing package, all three films, the anime, and bonus content. What more could you ask for. One of the best Sci-Fi films I think. It defiantly pushed the boundaries of the special effects world when it first debuted.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Very helpful to use while working on assignments. I would recommend this app highly. My wife and I use it regularly.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|There are people in my Book Club that are Reacher fanatics,  I am not one of them.  The one thing that gets in my way<br />is not having clothes somewhere in a closet, no address, no place to maintain hygiene, just a toothbrush.  I read the first one, but that was it for me.  Try one you might like it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it don't get me wrong but it's just that I die .. too much. They have cool things on there though
6305212112|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. A must see for anyone at any age! Highly recomended
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I bought the game, then discovered there was no starfruit. Can you please update it? I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I bought Lego Captain America Avenging cycle as a gift for my nephew and he loved it! Very happy with the product.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|The series has been going on too long. &#34;M&#34; looked like she was 90 years old, and James Bond was far behind her. Really boring. Turned it off part of the way through. A waste of money.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cool series I also like pranks between. Jeff and Julie his wife<br /><br />Cool cool cool cool cool cool series! Jeff Kinney rocks
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Great story, based ona true story. Photography was amazing. Gave you a real sense of the size and power of the waves.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love how everything is connected, like Nico being Hazel's brother, or Sammy being Leo. Also I can't wait for The House of Hades to come out!!!!!
159562015X|2.0|I was left wanting when I was all done.  I found out my top ones, but the next steps and suggestions were generic. Worse yet, these reviews left me thinking that my 5 strengths are completely awesome.  I would like more about the downsides - the cautions and the caveats.  What about my strengths could be challenging to others?  How might I be perceived?  What should I watch for?<br /><br />With 34 different items in the book, I'd like more about how to identify others with those types and/or how to work with them (and/or what types of combinations typically pair.)<br /><br />Also, what strengths are most complementary to a particular strength?  Or what strengths are most likely to conflict with this strength?  Without this additional insight, most of the book becomes a dense thicket for me to try to navigate on my own without a path.  Or, to ignore and have killed a small tree for no reason.  I feel like this was a bit of a dead end, or more of a promise unfulfilled.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Don't bother, this was terrible to begin with.  I expected it to be at least funny, but it was just embarrassing.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|Characters show no emotion.  It seems that this movie was just an excuse to create car chases, shootouts and explosions, with no real plot development.  And the cinematography wasn't even so good.  Lots of better choices.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|With the usual suspension of reality set aside, the film was a fun Bond movie.  I hope the Komodo dragons were well paid.
B00821PCJS|5.0|If you are a sci fi buff of the old school, this series is for you.  Creepy monsters with feelings, huge robots that shake the ground when they walk,,,,  and  the true villeins are not revealed until season 2. Plenty of blood, guts and gore but this series keeps you guessing.  Noah Wylie makes a very believable fighter,,,,  not his usual role as a bookish character.  Surprises keep coming throughout this spine chilling series.  Highly recommend watching.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a good game and it gets harder as you go on. I love this game so much. It's also quite an addictive game which isn't all that great.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love all the seasons of Supernatural and have been a fan for years.  I enjoy that they have the extras on the DVD and this set was great
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was a very good story line but I felt the author spent too much effort on Det. Corey`s misguided sense of humor.  He continually responded with sarcasm and inane comments in situations that called for sincerity and even political correctness.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I seldom buy DVD sets for a TV series but being a long time Supernatural fan I had to add these and keep the collection going.  I enjoy the extras on the discs and cannot wait for Season 8 to come out on DVD!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book teaches a GREAT lesson about learning to be yourself and to not judge a book by the cover. Wonder is a book for children,teens,and adults! This is my favorite book. I strongly suggest reading this book.
B000050HTO|5.0|I enjoy Dylan and this is a good cd of his music that I can enjoy when I want to hear it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book could have been shorter.  It was slow in the middle, but finished well. The character development was good and continued writhe next generation.  Reminds me of  a Mitchner epic. Can't wait for volume three.
B005JR47R6|4.0|I could see that this roll Wentworth played was both sides of who he really is. As far as being generous and loving his family that is, This roll must have been easy for him to get into, I will have to ask him one day. Over all House is a great show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really? End a series with Knocking Matthew off.  Now we have to wait for the next season and start with the Crowly's draped in black again. I hope Agnes doesn't get pregnant and die. We need a survival revival.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really FUN and I love it also<br />You can get new people an bores so it is really FUN.
0062082353|5.0|Got the hard cover edition...Superbly written...excellent depiction of one of Americas finest military heros...six more words are required for me to submit this...
B00421IR5I|5.0|Set in 60s France, all in poster bright cartoon colours and a rather anarchic, slapstick performance style, this is a child's eye view of the world.<br /><br />Nicolas (an enchanting performance by serious faced Maxime Godart) mistakenly assumes his mother is pregnant and is afraid he will be abandoned and unwanted when the new baby arrives. With his goofy collection of young friends he embarks on various plans to get rid of the baby.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his parents are worried about money, trying to climb the social ladder, currying favour with Nicolas's father's boss - a hilarious dinner party scene, where you know every single gag before it happens, but delight in the infectious, witty performances.<br /><br />This really is a totally feel-good film, but done with great wit and style, by all performers.<br /><br />It is the quirkiness, the great look of the film, the expertise of the performances and somehow a lack of saccharine sentimentality that make this so good.<br /><br />French Film, English subtitles, 91 minutes. This really is a film that can be enjoyed by both children AND adults. In patronises neither audience, nor does it indulge or overplay its feel-good nature. The length of the film is just right and stops the good jokes and set pieces from overstaying their welcome<br /><br />I received this as a free review copy
0307730697|5.0|Ordered 3 books, got them in no time, just finished &#34;No Easy Day&#34; & &#34;American Sniper&#34;, and about half way through &#34;Fearless&#34;. I strongly recommend this book.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Knowing that it takes time to build characters, this book did not really hold my interest until I was about half finished. It did not hold my interest until that time. But after that I found myself wondering what would happen next and now look forward to the next book in this trilogy.
0525953728|5.0|An excellent, fast paced depiction of first hand accounts from our Nation's top tier operators. This book doesn't just cover the raid that took down bin Laden, it truly paints a picture of the &#34;team players&#34; that our military's elite have to offer.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome, addicting game. But I really wish halfbrick would bring their game Monster Dash over to the Amazon market rather than just having it on the Apple app store. So yeah, but AWESOME GAME!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  What an amazing story and directed beautifully.  It definitely has deserved all the awards it has won!
0765325950|3.0|I have not finished this book yet, but I hope to eventually.  It seems, almost, that Sanderson was being paid by the word, and there were lots of them. It details individual battles too  much. I believe it could have been written with a third of the pages and still gotten the \\"Last Battle\\" story across. I am like all those who have waited and waited for the finish of this tale: it is over, but it took much too long, in this and the previous book, to end it.
B003Q97D48|5.0|My daughter got me into watching this series at the end of Season 2-I AM HOOKED!!! Absolutely love the show-but having missed 2 years of it makes it hard to catch up on due to the nature of this series-as a soap opera type show. U need to watch it all to really get clued inn. Purchased the 1st season to get up to speed. Love being able to watch if on my Kindle whenever I want. Will definitely be purchasing Sesson 2 !!!!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|I would to say i am a big fan they just do not have better songs then this  i would buy more later
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a very original way of telling the story of a young woman graduating from the foster care system. The hardships and set backs were described without being maudlin. Using the Victorian meanings of flowers added a dimension of originality and interest.<br />Our book club was unanimous in giving this book a five star rating.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.  Great story, great acting, was on the edge of my seat the entire time, even though I already knew the outcome.  Hope it wins the Oscar!
B008I34YCG|5.0|Frank has a way of recreating his band with just about every lp he made. It is pleasure to hear his music again. Sometimes for the first time. As was the case for this one. I found it on someone's top ten list of Frank Zappa's cd's and was not disappointed..
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not the greatest book I have ever read in my entire life. But nice, entertaining. Good for a holiday. Enjoy!
0385535147|5.0|This is another of Grisham's &#34;Can't put it down&#34; novels. Don't start it unless you have the time to finish it!
0307744434|5.0|Ive been in love with fantasy since reading fairytales, and used to read such books like people eat candy. Of late however, I found that newer books just seemed like the same old stories in new clothing. When someone suggested this one I was skeptic, but then I read the first few pages. What some people didn't like - the over detailed descriptions of the tents and set up - was probably what struck me first.  I was mesmerized by this world she created.  I loved her character development and the plot had some surprises.  The time changes were a little confusing but I adjusted. All in all I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone in love with magic and wonder.<br /><br />My only complaint is that all of it wasn't real! I want to go to that circus! Now, where did I put my red scarf...
0698400852|5.0|Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell, this is not abridged either which is a huge plus. If you want an edition of A Christmas Carol on your shelf, this is definitely a good one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book is about teenagers with cancer it was not sad or depressing.  The characters were well developed and very enjoyable.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Because this game looked like fun. I just had to buy/ get it. And this game is not boring at all! I mean it's fun :)
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Great series, great actors, great story!  I only had it on VHS so I was just replacing it with a DVD. It's a must add to your collection. We could watch it over and over and do.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|A generous selection of clear sounds is complimented by gorgeous pictures. I pive the auto turn off timer as well!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Purchased this headset for about $100 in late 2012. It might be a bit expensive for the money but it does work well.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it is the occasional drop - it loses audio transmission for about 1-2 seconds and then corrects itself. This is rare though, probably happening about once a night (2-4 hour session) and is probably due to some interference (like a microwave or something).<br /><br />The recharging cable is kind of difficult to plug in sometimes because of the angle and how small it is. However, you can use the headset while it's charging and it has a pretty long wire. I haven't had to charge while using it since the charge lasts over 5 hours for me.<br /><br />Turning the headset off is a bit annoying. Unless there's a better way I don't know about, you have to hold down the tiny power button for a couple seconds.<br /><br />I honestly don't use any of the buttons on there, but if that's your thing you can program them. I played around with the voice-altering software; it works but it's really not something anyone would ever use.<br /><br />Besides the wireless functionality I think the best feature is moving the microphone up disables audio transmission (like if you need to use the bathroom).<br /><br />I also bought a pair my girlfriend; she also likes them.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My score on my kindle and iPhone does not natch- and my score does not add up each time,score has not change as the on either d we vice in over two weeks
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Haven't seen the movie yet but LOVED this book!<br />Couldn't put it down, characters draw you in, feels<br />Like you live there.
0060594896|5.0|First I would like to say we have tried everything to take our company to the next level, we ordered a copy for every employee and held weekly workshop on the book.  Within the first week huge changes started happening.  The biggest change with our managers was attitude, they walked different, they talked different, they performed different.  I have been give new hope through his book.  I know that we just needed the tools to have a focus and a vision.  Thank you Jack for saving us.!! I expect profits to triple, as in the first month sales have went through the roof.! It's amazing.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Tres bonne souris. Sans doute la meilleure de ma collection. Pour un prix,de plus,largement inferieur a ses homologues. A acheter au plus vite.
B005HSL626|5.0|great program for children to practice dexterity and eye coordination.<br /><br />good for adults--makes one realize how far technology has come since we started using computers.
006197806X|4.0|Another great series. Just per-ordered the third book and can not wait to get it. The hardest pard is finding time to read uninterrupted.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Caught up from the first page and couldn't put it down. It really hit home with mother daughter relationship. Excellent read
B0093LINVK|3.0|I understood that the unit did not include memory and hard drive storage - but it said it came with the power supply. IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE C6 POWER CABLE FOR THE POWER SUPPLY (a very not so standard power cable carried at the local electronics stores). It does come with a wonderful little Intel chime when you open the box (sort of like a musical greeting card) - I can't imagine that having this device to play the sound when opening the box was more important than an actual power cable to plug the unit in and power it on. I am very disappointed - and I purchased three of them.  The next dissapointment was that the 3 mSata SSD drives I bought from Amazon (OCZ Strata 30 GB) do not work with this system (they do not show up in the BIOS / tried updating to the latest motherboard BIOS - nothing. The SSD drive has some LED - and they light up).  I find it hard to believe I purchased three bad SSD drives - so it makes me believe that the motherboard is incompatible with the SSD (even though they should work just fine).  It is a great little chassis, but the out of the box experience has left me wondering why I didn't just buy the Mac Mini for the slightly higher price and much less hassle.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Quality is incredible. Movie streams flawlessly. Movie itself was the beter of the new bond movies, though not as good as the originals
B00846F1YW|5.0|You never know what to expect on EVERY level. The hints can help a lot but you can mostly do it yourself. The game has so many different levels and things to do that I couldn't Puritanism until I was done!!! 22 levels of nonstop fun.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very good book. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book. Fifty shades darker. Looking forward to read this.
B00AM3H1MA|5.0|Over the decades I have owned numerous Philips audio products, but never was impressed enough to write about them. While Philips is not generally known as a high-end manufacturer - they have been entering this market across much of their audio line. This was the first over-the-ear headphone in their Fidelio audiophile headphone line-up, and occupies the mid-size, mid-price position in a power-trio worthy of Cream or the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lots of brushed, machined aluminum, matt-black metal ear-cups, with metal grill inserts, and a real stitched leather headband set this product apart from the cheap plastic construction of other competitors. There are no flashy 'urban' logos or graphics, so you won't look like a hippity-hoppity dork on the street or subway (unless, of course, you are dressed like one). If Darth Vader owned headphones, these would be his first choice. Philips claims the design was inspired by the nose of a Bentley town-car.<br /><br />Super-comfy memory-foam earpads and fully articulating pivots and joints make these easy to wear for hours at a time. The semi-open back design reduces the tendency of over-ear cans to get hot and sweaty, especially important for walking around or chilling on a sunny patio. Two 1 metre cords (one with Apple-compatible volume/pause controls) are supplied and may be used together, and they have a deluxe braided cloth covering that is as attractive as it is flexible.<br /><br />Then there is the sound. These are not 'bass-head' cans, so Dr. Dre devotees need not apply. They do have an extended bass-range, and kick-out the jams without making you wade through artificially booming, muddy, droning mid-bass. Mids are ultra-smooth and detailed, without scratchy grain. The treble is open and airy - without being bright or sibilant. In short these are neutral headphones with a slightly warm ambiance and dark sound-scape. Imaging with good recordings is first-rate, partly due to the semi-open back design. That also means these 'phones leak some sound to the outside, but it is not the harsh hash that loud cheap earbuds spew forth. In fact, it is quite intelligible, so nearby people will likely know what you are playing, assuming they are hip to your grooves. If you are not a bass-head, but listen to an eclectic mix of different genres, these may be the perfect choice. Able to go portable, but still great for extended listening with a home rig, they are a great all-around choice with superior sound and construction to anything in their price-range. Philips - you done made me a proud believer, and a very happy customer. If you are serious about your headphones, and not a slave to celebrity-endorsed plastic crap (Monster Beats, Gaga-gags, etc.) you owe it to yourself to check these out. They will make you a believer, and might even cure a mild case of Belieber-fever.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Yay! It finally got here. I've already imported it to my iPod and shared with my mother. :) No one beats the Beatles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|must download if u love horses or just need something to do also it teaches u to care for animals
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is really a great series. This pack has all the season's episodes and also the movies too. It really made a great gift for my girlfriend - she loves it.<br /><br />Now that said there are some things which I find super annoying. There are some places where the audio was out of sync with the video. Also the aspect ratio doesn't fit well on a modern widescreen tv, so (depending on your tv) you may have bars on the sides of the picture or zoomed in and loose some of the top and bottom or stretch it to fit. This is understandable though as it was made for broadcast years ago but still super annoying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great app for  horse lovers that can not afford the real thing yet! I absolutely recommend this app.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There should be a warning label on the box: &#34; WARNING - Watching this the first season of Firefly will cause lifelong pain and depression because it is also the last.&#34;<br />I hope someone at Fox got fired for canceling this awesome science fiction western.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|It has been a few years since I last saw the Ascent of Man. So it was exciting to order a copy and a joy to once again relive those moments when I was first exposed to the series. It brought back old memories about why I have continued to develop my on-going interest in the history of science. I highly recommend the quality and content of the series.
B000059TEP|4.0|everybody know this is a great movie. i bought this used, but in great shape and arrived on time. happy with purchase.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. However I am not satisfied with the ending. This is my first kindle book I have read. I am not satisfied with the layout 1. Acknowledgments 2. About the author 3. TWO exerts from other Flynn novels AND 4. I am unable to read the ending without giving a review of the book. 5. After completing my forced review I am unable to submit my review because I am on an airplane and do not have a wireless connection to submit my review!!!!  Please fix this dilemma!!!  The ending will have to wait another 6hrs until I land!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I enjoy the comedy on broadcast and also like the series' dvds - try it you'll like it, I think ;)
B007V2UGPE|4.0|not bad. interesting enough to keep me playing. nice game. get it if your looking for a an action defense game
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A real page turner as usual for Clancy.  This was my first for a Kindle and I just loved it.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I like Garfield better than this game even when you up grade the service and tables remain the same and the only way to get hearts to buy more help is to buy it with real money I only give it three stars because my daughter loves hello Kitty
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Love it.  Protects my kindle, love the color and the material.  It can stand while I am holding a sleeping baby and I can still read.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book is the best. Joseph Murphy nails it down. I love it. I would recommend anyone that want to change their life or their relationship to money, success, loved ones at leat try it. It might help you.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Really compelling story....2 mins in, I was hooked.  I did have some trouble with my amazon video library and had to restart a couple of times.  Not sure what was happening.  Good story.  A surprise around every corner.  PERFECT casting all around.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Mr Washington is a great actor but I was not wild about this movie.  He played a good part and did a great job but my spouse enjoyed it very much.  Maybe I was just tired when watching it.  Any movie with Denzel Washington is worth watching.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A friend of mine told me it was a good movie. I had to see for myself , and he was right. Another Great movie from Denzel Washington !! Watch it !!
B0092VYUOK|5.0|It would be really hard to give a bad review for these games!!! Love them, glad to finally own them, and I really like that I could copy them to my ps3 so now I can give the disc to someone else!!!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|this is a very good case for the Kindle Fire, price was right and it looks like it will stand uo to use for years.
0823003590|5.0|I found the drawings just what I have been seeking as I enjoy working with tinted charcoal pencils and it would appear so to does the Author of this excellent book<br />Characters young or old , delicate or rugged literally jump from the page urging one to get to the drawing board and  attempt to create a masterpiece
B004TI5N38|5.0|Like all other Baldacci novels, I couldn't put it down. His writing style makes it so easy to continue that you feel sad when you finished the book.
B00BHMEALA|4.0|Well, I'm writing this one day before the Oscars and I wanted to see this before the big show. I really liked the movie. The directing was very good (big nod to Ben Affleck) and the story was fascinating. I also appreciate the fact that the movie was honest about how the situation in Iran before the \\"Argo\\" operation took place. But there are a few moments of Hollywood cliche that weren't necessary in the film. The story was interesting enough where it didn't need some of the extra \\"flashy\\" stuff.<br /><br />With that said, its going up against \\"Lincoln\\" and its just not better than that. I understand that \\"Argo\\" is the American feel good movie of the year, but artistically it can't hold a candle to the flick about Honest Abe. Just my opinion.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Very good family  movie, great story line, need more movies like this. Good from start to finish. Makes you realize how precious life is
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book validates the worthiness of being an introvert. Now I understand better the value of my own personality traits and how to better interact with both introverts like myself, and extroverts. This is a book that will be read again.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|I gave it a single star, didn't even deserve that. Don't watch it, a waste of time. Go and get a 6 pack of beer, it will be more entertaining.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|I found this to be a very comprehensive, touching, and reflective film about one of my favorite musicians. Beautiful presentation!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|We really enjoyed watching these movies.  I recommend this set to  anyone who enjoys thoughtful action movies.  Inspired me to read the book and the first movie is well done in comparison to book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Other than Night Over Water, I've always been a huge Follett fan and this one doesnt disappoint. Plenty of action, strong character building and vivid descriptions.  Can't wait for book two!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|A little slow but pretty original. Def a good one to watch late at night. My fiancé actually had a panic attack at the end
B004DLPXAO|3.0|As someone who used to own a kindle, this app falls far behind my expectations. The ability to read books, change font size, turn pages quickly is fine. It's the organization, or lack there of, that drives me crazy. I have no idea which books I've read, which ones I've not read. I can't put them into folders or categories like I could on my kindle. It would be nice to file books I've finished into a separate folder, or if there was a way to  tell which books I've read or not in the list of books. That's really irritating. My kindle fire it told me which books I've opened, and which ones were new. This app doesn't do that. I read at least 5 books a week and need a way to organize them, this app falls short.
B00139XZF4|5.0|THE ON THING THAT HAS TO BEE DONE IS KEEPING THE CHURCH FORM TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO! i WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE NEXT CHAPTER, AND WAS DISSIPOINTED ABOUT NO REMAKE. HOPE FULLY THE MAKE AN INDIE OUT OF IT!!! tHE MAD EYE

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was so taken with the free app that I asked my husband about the expanded version. Needless to say I am more than thrilled with the upgrade.  I use the  Relaxation Melodies Premium to just sit back and read, for naps and bedtime. The timer feature is a big plus as well.  I am very pleased with and impressed by this app.  It is incredible. A must for anyone.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|it was a very good family movie a classic type of move. i just expected more out of it from all the praise it recieved!! It was avery well made movie...so there, I don't want to get in farther into it watch it for your self and see! The Mad eye!
B00000IMTF|5.0|Although Rainbow had more chart success and hit singles with other albums, none of those releases has endured the test of time as well as their second album, Rising. This was Rainbow's moment as all of the songs are stellar, balancing focused shorter tracks where nary a moment is wasted with longer dramatic songs in which guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, keyboardist Tony Carey, and lead vocalist Ronnie James Dio show off their impressive talents. The rhythm section of bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Cozy Powell are fantastic throughout and their performances bring the perfect accompaniment to each track. \\"Stargazer\\" is a long epic where Carey's majestic keyboard lines are very memorable and Blackmore lays out a long classical based solo. \\"A Light in the Black\\" is a chugging monster where Blackmore and Carey trade off wicked solos. Meanwhile, you have great little nuggets with the near boogie of \\"Starstruck\\", the mid-tempo groove of \\"Run With the Wolf\\", and the charging \\"Tarot Woman\\".  The melodic \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" is the most melodic track and is a winner as well. All told, Rising is a classic heavy metal album and is one of the must-own releases of the genre. Highly recommended.
B004856SQ8|5.0|ACTION FOM START TO FINISH AND THERE PRETTY TOUGH GUY. I HOPE THE MAKE ANOTHER AN TURN IT INTO LIKE A MINISERIES
B000062X90|5.0|I never listened to Wishbone Ash until a couple months ago when I discovered them on the Deep Tracks channel on SiriusXM radio. I heard a few songs which led to me purchasing Argus here on Amazon since I read that this was their best album. Well, I could see why this has received so many 5 star reviews. This is an excellent album. And with the harmonized lead vocals as well as the dual lead guitars, they have a sound all their own. \\"Time Was\\" and \\"Sometimes World\\" are my favorite tracks, both of which start out as hippie acoustic folk before blooming into wicked guitar workouts. Having been a fan of Thin Lizzy's twin guitar sound for many years, it's a joy to hear Andy Powell and Ted Turner play together as well as exchange solos. Martin Turner's bass lines on \\"Sometime World\\" are awesome as well. \\"Blowin' Free\\" is the most radio friendly tune and is pretty catchy while \\"Leaf and Stream\\" is mellow and whimsical. \\"The King Will Come\\", \\"Warrior\\", and \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" are strong progressive tracks with more cerebral lyrics and of course, plenty of killer guitar playing within its grooves. The bonus tracks, originally released as the Live from Memphis EP, are looser and grittier but are still very good. So thanks to SiriusXM for introducing me to this terrific band and to Amazon for having these great albums available for purchase. I intend to pick up more discs by Wishbone Ash in the near future. Oh and I'm going to see them live in 2 weeks.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|what better way to spend inside on a rainy day / night or anytime for that mater and watch a top westen.thank you
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|one of the good angry birds<br />cool nice awesome fun<br />I like it a lot<br />it is a lot of fun
B00005LOUP|5.0|this is a movie we watch every year as a family. It is so funny and yet it has a meaning as well
B0098XY5VK|5.0|Love time management games so had to try it out. Played the first round and enjoyed it so purchased it. Not bad for $.99. Playing on a Kindle Fire and had no problems purchasing it nor downloading. Maybe I'm jinxing myself but it's working fine so far.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I would recommend the internet instead of the dictionary definition from this book. Next time l need the definition of a word I would use the internet.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I can't understand what all the positive reviews were about. Not one original scene: everything stolen from Batman, previous Bond movies, etc. Dialogue written by kids in the 8th grade. 3 hours of my life wasted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|cool game, but very hard and very slowli destrikt the temps of game .I very hapy , that is awersom and cool ))
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas. It came in great condition and was in a very good price.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|works for me! what more can I say about a piece of wire? xxxxxxx  this is a stupid requirement..xxxxxx BS
B003SI1T06|1.0|If your an insomniac in need of sleep, this movie is for you. You'll sleep better than you ever have during this movie. I share the same opinion of this movie as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character Elaine Benes in Seinfeld.<br /><br />\\"Seinfeld: The English Patient\\" (1997)<br />[Elaine and Peterman are watching \\"The English Patient\\". Elaine is about to freak out of boredom]<br />Elaine Benes: [quietly] No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long.<br />Elaine Benes: [yells] Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert, and just die already! DIE!<br />J. Peterman: [surprised] Elaine, you don't like the movie?<br />Elaine Benes: [shouts] I hate it!<br />[the audience shushes Elaine]<br />Elaine Benes: [shouts back] Oh, go to hell!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Crying.<br />Buy it. BUY IT.<br />Just buy it.<br />HOLD ONTO YOUR SOUL AND BUY IT!<br />My heart hurts a bit.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|i actually bought this on accident if you can imagine. i didn't know you could buy them on amazon, so...anyway, it'll be nice when i need a sherlock fix and do not have the hard copy around.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Required reading for a 7th grader!  Though group effort and collaboration are laudable and often time preferred, this story laid the groundwork for a discussion focused on the necessity of independent thought and sometimes an independent course.
B0091REZMW|4.0|My daughter got me to load this.  We enjoy searching together. As you play you get the hang of where to look on the screens to find things.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Excellent read. I finished this in two days (because my library loan was about to end and because it was that good). It's written in first person, in a very entertaining style. The main character is a 21 century old Druid and the language is a pleasant mix of ancient and modern - as it should be when one lives for 21 centuries and needs to learn to blend but can't expunge every bit of the old formality or verbiage.<br /><br />The story is suspenseful, the characters are quite varied (vampires, werewolves, witches, and humans) and there's a very entertaining dog thrown in the mix for good measure.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|cool game fast paced I cant stop playing it. Don't know what else to say if you like running through mazes you'll love this game too
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Not a fan yet of Amazon movies due to the fact that sometimes you guys forget Redbox is renting the same movies for lest that $1.50 while your team is still sitting on the same movie for about $4.00...nevertheless having this type of movie available to us &#34;general primer users&#34; is a great start...just need to keep it up...we still have some good expectations for you/your service.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I heard one of the songs on the radio and I knew I had to listen to more of Alt-J. Got the CD from my library and I knew I just had to own my own copy of 'An Awesome Wave'. Couldn't find it in the stores, hence Amazon. I recommend the album to anyone who is interested in this kind of music, all the tracks are awesome. Money well spent
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great coming-of-age film. Masterful onion peeling of main character. Excellent acting and expert casting. Enjoyed watching it with my teenagers.
B006PERRMY|5.0|This is a nice twist to life. Live to 25 and must work for more time after that. When they earn there time the prices go up. This movie reminds me of our own economy where the people get tax refunds and the gas prices go up. The Rich walk and the Poor run. Nice movie
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Man I could totally relate to this book. Once again, Jeff Kinney fails to make Greg as least like me as possible!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Ok Denzel you are way to calm and cool when starring death in the face. Oh I forgot, he was drunk! Plane, Train or Automobile this dude is never scared. It was an ok movie over all.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|Excellent recording; great performances. Very strong vocals with excellent lyrics punctuated by excellent guitar work. This is a very strong modern blues recording.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Why are super Heros revealing who they are? The hero should never reveal his/her identity. This movie was way too long, and not that good. Best part of the movie is the beginning on the plane.  After that all you get is Batman getting beat by Bain like a step child. Yeah, Bain beat the brakes off Batman. Don't waste 3hrs on this film.
B006885FZI|5.0|This put me back in time, when the world was in jeopardy.  Americans stood tall, bore the fear and the grief both at home and on the front.  This movie puts you in the life of the front-line Marine, feeling what he feels.  Truly one of the best movies, not just a war movie, but a movie series for the ages.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It keeps you watching throughout the whole movie. It's older but if you haven't seen it yet its worth the watch.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|um the graphic are cool. but you get bored after five min. not.much to do and a short time to even.play so you cant build anything real cool. and................... that's it
B004XDYJRU|1.0|update will not work. cant use it now. kindle fire 8'9 hope it gets fixed soon<br />will cange review once i can use
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a great story. Shocking and funny too. Don't miss it.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|The books is good but it is very difficult to read in the Kindle wihtout being able to go to specific pages.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites and I am so happy to own it now.  I watch it and laugh. Excellent seller
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I got this album because I love Florence + The Machine and wanted &#34;Sweet Nothing,&#34;  the track with her vocals. The rest of the album is just as fantastic. Does not disappoint!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have played this game on my computer several times. It is fun, but it would be better if I COULD DOWNLOAD THE MOTHER FREAKING THING.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the giant. monkey is the best way better than number 1 hang gliders but they should add more charecters insted of just 4 of them
B009O2XY12|2.0|This game is always wanting you to pay for more credits to play.If I purchase a game to play I don't think it should be asking for more money to continue to play.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Much like The Empire Strikes Back, this book leaves you in a state of uncertainty in the end. Tyrion finally tastes a real battle. Brans dreams are now part of his reality. Arya and her constant struggle to be herself again. Catelyn feverishly doing her best to tie the big picture together. Jon beyond the wall, looking and being looked upon at the same time, while Sansa wastes away in kings landing like a marionette surrounded by fire. And the game changing Mellisandre showing off her sorcery when nodded to do so. This book took my breath in some chapters. I can't wait to start reading book 3 immediately!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|McEwan manages once again to bring us into his protagonist's world, however foreign that may be for the reader.  The fact that he can do so from a woman's perspective is all the more remarkable.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I used to play the Puzzaz one on the old Kindle, and I found it easier to make notes. You have to play landscape mode for easy notes.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love their music and I am a huge fan.I have listened to this cd over and over.Can't wait for better dig two to come out.On pins and needles waiting!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|stories. I always feel when I read his books that I am there. I will be waiting for him to write another so I can bury myself in it!
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Written with humor and humility.  A window not only into Craig Ferguson's life, but also Scotland, London, New York, LA, defeat and success in both the public and private worlds - a page-turner and a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen was very frank and did not hold back on the truths that occurred during the stringent training and how precise the seals have to be when protecting us as Americans. It is sad to know that they risk their lives and yet it goes unnoticed when they deserve so much more from us as United States citizens.
B007THA4FI|2.0|With a mix of miserable characters, far too many to keep track of, I'm surprised I read the whole thing.  At the end, I asked myself 'what just happened?  What was that? '
0765317389|5.0|Been looking for awhile for this book in hardback. It is nice to finally find one that is not over priced.
030758836X|4.0|This was a book of several complicated plots, all of which sadly seemed to fizzel out at the very end. It was almost that Flynn could not figure out who (husband or wife) should prevail at the book's conclusion. But right up until the last page, this was one damn good book. A real psychopathic symbiotic marriage relationship that appears to succeed, at first due to fear, but ultimetely due to a sickly reliance on one another.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Can't say enough good about this product.  Been looking for a good external sound card for a long time and this is it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|interesting and a good book  Reminds me somewhat of a movie that came out a month or so ago.  Enjoy
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Its not Oscar worthy but sure a lot of fun. And isnt that what comic book heroes suppose to be?
1439102813|5.0|This a good book -- really helped me with this Alzheimer disease.<br />Would recommend it to others.  I haven given  my copy to the local library.
B00821OX98|5.0|Watched the first episode and was like &#34;this is ok, but...&#34; Decided to give it one more show then I was hooked! I've watched all of season one and season two and looking forward to three. It's kind of alien, end of world, human drama type show. Did you know that Dream Works and Spielberg are involved? Check it out.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Always like watching this move on tv with my grandparents.<br />Very nice now to have my own copy as I hardly ever see this movie listed as one of the TV specials around Christmas time.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|he loves this little ridiculous cat, he especially loves it when it repeats everything I say like it's making fun of me.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This signal finder works great!<br />Pick's up all the signals around me.<br />Like the display of all the separate networks at one time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie is strange and a little off, but he is genuine. A great character for a Great book! I hope the movie does it justice.
1878424505|5.0|Great find yourself book.  Well written and an easy read.  Loads of self information to enhance your life and the life of others.<br />Great self help book!!!!
B0040JHWKS|5.0|not being a huge Bruce fan , unlike my wife , i went over the edge on this masterpiece !!!<br />it has joined the ranks of my top 100 of a 25,000 cd collection !!!<br />hat's off Bruce !!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I just love this show. I did not catch it on Fox. Started watching it on sci channel. Thank you for streaming.
B0054YH8VQ|5.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I fell in love with the music Christian played as well as his character!  I listened to this entire CD while traveling to Florida from Michigan in my car... I have it memorized! now I will have to read the fifty series again to associate the music with the story sequences at a different level of understanding!! can't wait to re- read them!!
B000GW8OAK|4.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I just listened  to the CD  while traveling by car to Florida from Michigan! I played it over & over!! I find it stress relieving!
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Love the way Tatiana de Rosnay writes and thought this book was a fabulous read.  It is about a genre I am very interested in which investigates the horrible things the European Jews encountered at the hands of Hitler's Germans.  This particular book dealt with what happened in just a couple days in France that was not well known and the story of a young girl who locked her very young brother in a closet to save him from being taken to the camps and follows the young girl as she tries to get back to him.  This is part of the story but the other part deals with the American author and her story as she follows up on Sara.  It is a book that you will always remember.
B0057ZAA0S|4.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I got this to complete a quest on another game. I now find myself doing this one more. The dragons are adorable and the quests are reasonable.
B000FZEQS2|4.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Couldnt put the game away sometimes.  I enjoy their games they hold my interest with the great graphics and mystery.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Compelling story, couldn't put it down, it was super fantastic and interesting, a great coming off age rebellion story, woot
B0033AI48Y|5.0|Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|AMAZING MOVIE!! A great end to an awesome trilogy. Possibly one of the all time best & most complete trilogies ever!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is very engaging and fun to watch.  Jared & Jensen are like real brothers and work great together.  Love it - one of my favorites.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|This is a quality action movie!! I have been waiting for a good action movie to come along that has 2 things: 1) amazing action. & 2) great acting. I found it here! Way better than all those dumb Jason Statham crap movies!! Denzel is the man! Seriously one of the best action movie's I have seen in quite awhile.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Another Christmas gift that our son truly liked and began playing right away.  Shopping online makes it simple and easy.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Great movie! Robert Downey Jr is the man! I very much enjoyed it. Also the bad guy in this one is pretty bad ass. Cool story too
B006YC74E8|1.0|Lots of options, but when I've cropped a photo, where is it saved? Better yet, how do I save it??? It should be BLATANTLY OBVIOUS, or some frigging instructions! This app has neither.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Awesome movie! i love it. The first of a solid three movies by Christopher Nolan. The guy is a genius!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as good as the first one. they added a few extra things that make it more challenging, but in truth, they are very simmilar
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Weak storyline, in fact it is easily forgettable. But the stunts and action in this movie make it worth the buy. This movie was created while there was a writers strike in Hollywood. Because of this, I think the plot suffers a bit.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can play it for hours without getting board, or even realizing that I have been playing for hours. That is the sign of a good game, right?
B004LL1HM4|3.0|Its alright. The previous album was better, and their ep (Sun King) was waaaay better. This album is worth buying but I don't think its as creative or engaging as the last 2 albums
B002VECM4A|5.0|I remember seeing this in theaters when it came out. Was a wonderful movie had every emotion u could think of. Monique and Gabrielle were so believable. I will have to read that book sometime.
B001LV5OOY|4.0|Great album. This album is amazing to listen to in the car while driving. I very much enjoy it :)
B007JZGIMS|5.0|And will as soon as Amazon releases the new version which fixes the bug in the current one. In this current version there are huge ads which block the view of the album titles when using landscape as view mode.    It also would be nice if it had a volume adjust function.    The customer service is excellent.    Update-7/3/2013    Everything ok, app works great and I have never dealt with a better support team for any product more helpful and pleasant than the JRT folks.    There is a new version out which has been submitted to Amazon by JRT but they are dragging their feet in putting it up in the app store.    Update 2/12/2015    This player continues to get better and better and the support from JRT is nothing short of amazing. I have never had a question or issue regarding this product which has not been addressed to my satisfaction within 24 hours.    The problem I have with this app as well as other Kindle apps is actually with Amazon and I have mentioned it before. It takes them entirely to long to get the new versions up on the Amazon site so they can be downloaded. I have the latest build available on Amazon now but it is not the most recent version, that one appears in the Google Play store. It contains a fix for an album art problem I and others have had.    Kudos to the JRT team for a continuing well done job.    BUT    Amazon needs to speed up it's vetting process on these apps
B0017R5UAA|4.0|This is a fun album. I enjoy it. Fleet Foxes are folky fun. Thats all I've got for now, fun
B007THA4FI|4.0|Language was course but that probably is part of the story and the characters.  One can understand the hatred that each group  had for the other.  Haves and have nots.
B008220C38|1.0|I was so excited to see this film and it never came to theaters in my area.  I then pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon and couldn't wait for its arrival.  However, I now understand the reason it was a flop and did not make it to most theaters.  This director took the greatest novel of all time, the best actors, and had the chance to create an Oscar worthy film.  However, it was disrespectfully  turned into a playhouse theater farce.  A comedy, Anna Karenina was not meant to be.  The trailers did not reveal this betrayal, but instead advertised it as an epic, serious film.  High hopes crushed to incredible disbelief and disappointment.  Don't waste your money on this unless you need a coaster for your coffee table.
0756404746|5.0|A MUST READ. The best fantasy series I have ever read, and I have read several.  Patrick Rothfuss has true talent.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This alarm is great and customisable for every situation. Waking up to different sounds every day keeps the body guessing and gently wakes you.
B00422LESO|5.0|I loved the author already, from Goose Girl and the Books of Bayern. I decided to give this a try, as I love Jane Austen books. It did not disappoint. Captivating, romantic, humorous. Recommended to anyone who need  to be caught by a book right away.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Could have been a good movie had it been written to appeal to all audiences. It was juvenile and a waste of time to attempt to watch.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The first season was great this season is even better Love this show, its one of them shows where you dont want it to end
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had this on the phone but it was small the kindle fire is the perfect size and this is awesome its defiently worth it buy this!!!:)
B008HTQ28K|3.0|This was an extremely far-fetched novel, not up to normal high standards that we expect from John Grisham.  Although brilliantly thought out, it was just too incredible to be even vaguely realistic.  None the less, still an entertaining read.
B008M34INW|4.0|It was good, similar to payback but with a little more enjoyable, content. Mel Gibson, really stood out, in his performance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love survival cause there are mobs but be careful they took away my 9 diamonds creative I like but NO MOBS! Plus u dont even have pickaxe but how in the name of minecraftology could you collect Redstone in pe a couple more things I HATE YOU CREEPERS! I wish hero brine was on here too he is sooooooo scary if you play pc version at night dont build a brine shrine!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I honestly expected more from what the commercials lead on. After a while the movie began to drag, this movie had so much potential, to be more with its actors and cinematography.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The characters pull you in. Their emotions are vividly displayed. I felt as though I was watching a movie and could actually see what was happening. Great, great story.
B0037VNX44|1.0|This movie was so dull and boring, I can't began to explain how slow paced and out there, this movie was.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I found this book very interesting. It is not my typical type of book but I find with my new Kindle I will by things on a wim. I did enjoy it though, I think because it is very different from anything else I have read lately. It almost reminds me of a kid book. I think high school kids would like it because of the weirdness of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series on TV I have ever enjoyed watching.  The cast is amazing and you can't wait for each episode to see how things develop both upstairs and downstairs.I hope this series continues for years!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|this game is fun but it looks like super mario bros like, alot. There is one level that is virtually impossible so after 2 hours of trying to pass it, i gave it a good rest before playing it again. Other than that, this game is really fun. *Beware of repetitive, slightly annoying, background music!* :P
B008M87GJK|5.0|I prefer BBC news and this is a nice app! Easy to navigate and I get the headlines quickly when I don't have time for the rest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good old &#34;straight&#34; game of solitaire.  Really like the way it's set up.  From the way it automatically puts the cards back at the end of the game; to the hint feature.  My perfect Solitaire.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Although I play at lot of golf,  I never thought I'd own a laser rangefinder or GPS.  I just never saw the value.  But recently, the pro at my club loaned me his V2 for a round and I discovered I was wrong.  The V2 is extremely fast and easy to use.  Having the exact yardage to the flag is one less thing you have to worry about and gives me confidence to strike solid iron shots.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.<br />I don't know how many times I've watched this, over the years.<br />Stands up to the test of time - a classic.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great motivator! Perfect timing I'm going to start this program asap!<br />I also bought 50 myths and shredded chef. :D
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I spent the extra $4 for the blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy for both the DVD and digital copies.  The DVD copies are two double-sided discs that play OK in my portable DVD player, but I'd have preferred four or five single sided discs just to minimize the possibility of damaging a disc during use.  The digital copy doesn't play in my mac on iTunes after almost 5 hours to download the entire set.  Apparently I need a monitor that is HDCP compatible.  How I fix that on a laptop I'll take up with my Apple dealer.  My iPod isn't capable either, though I'd die from eye strain watching it on a 1.5 inch screen.  I don't own an iPad so I'm not sure if the problem goes away with them.  I like the series, and I'll enjoy the blu-ray at home, but it would have been nice to take it with me on travels and thats why I'm glad it wasn't that much more for something I really didn't receive.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Heard about the show for years and finally gave it a shot. What a show. Glad I could watch the whole season on demand. Watched season one in a week's time. Highly recommend this show. It gets better next season!
B00A85EMVK|1.0|As others have already pointed out, the transfer to 3D is horrible.  I was convinced at first I must have received a defective copy but after reading the other reviews clearly that is not the case.  One of my favorite action movies ever...ruined to the point of who cares about the 3D, the graininess is so bad in many scenes that it is un-watchable IMO.  Much better off just watching the 2D blu-ray disk, which I already owned so now I have two.  Sigh, lesson learned - never pre-order a new release.<br /><br />Also note that almost every review SINCE THE 3D BLU-RAY RELEASE has been 1 or 2 stars.  The high ratings for this disc were written BEFORE it was even released (I hate it when people do that).  If you look at the actual post-release ratings, it gets about a 1-1/2 star rating, which should tell you something.<br /><br />Shame on Paramount Studios for releasing a garbage 3D transfer of a great movie.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|After hearing so much about this movie, I finally rented it.  It was a beautiful movie.  Very romantic, yet sad at times.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I'm a big Denzel Washington fan, but I was a bit disappointed with this effort. The first 15 minutes are pretty good, with the exception of the ridiculous &#34;gratuitious partial nudity&#34; at the beginning. The remainder was somewhat interesting, but it seemed to drag along to a fairly predictable ending. Washington just didn't bring this role to life as well as some other roles he's had in the past.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|First off, I appreciate the attempt at creating an affordable Merlin knock off.  Here is what happened with the one I purchased:<br /><br />1) the screw that holds the plate to the camera was too long and would hold the camera snug to the plate.  This made for jerky motions when using the steady cam with any sort of mild force.<br /><br />2) 2nd, it is not easy (impossible) to adjust the tension of the handle so that, even when balanced correctly, you can still have a little stiffness while walking. It stayed loose and made it super sensitive and hard to use.<br /><br />3) Here is what made me return it with avid frustration... My Nikon D800 hit the floor when another main screw (the one that holds the plate that is attached to the camera to the steady cam) stripped and popped off while using it.  Walking... mildly... not doing anything extreme... boom!<br /><br />SAVING MONEY HERE IS NOT WORTH THE RISK OF YOUR CAMERA HITTING THE GROUND FROM 5 FT UP.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Boring and lifeless.  I kept waiting for some semblance of a mystery.  I wish that I had seen a negative review before I picked up this dreadfully awful book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the shows and can wait for more to watch the story line of this show is amazing and can wait to see the upcoming episodes
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Loved the storyline.  It was a very interesting read.  The characters were none like the characters I have encountered before.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it a lot and enjoy it! The many combinations of cards sometimes are hard to get thru and &#34;win&#34;. But I keep playing it and somehow they work themselves out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are plenty of games and some of them are easy and some difficult and looking foward to discover the next game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Found this interesting as it was an unique story line, and was well written.  Think you will enjoy the romance of it.
B008MM9630|4.0|love this game however I can not make purchases. I don't know what to do. I need diamonds to continue.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I can agree that it starts off fast then slow. I drifted off a few times on the slow parts. Am a true action pack fan and hoped the action was going to keep me awake but the music did. I love seeing Denzel as himself without the makeup and disguise but he looked as himself which he looked good. Also love seeing him standing against another great actor Don which the two are no comparison. The story had its twists and turn which I kind of find interested. I wish there was some consecutive plane crashes instead one big one in the beginning that wrapped itself around the plot. There should have been minor ones then the big showed in the movie last that would have suspected something was wrong with the plot for sure. Overall I like the movie and the message about alcoholism it was trying to send. And I seriously doubt that there will be a sequences.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I thought the story did not live to its expectations. I  found myself skimming pages just to get to the point of the whole thing which wasn't really that much if  a surprise anyway. I wouldn't recommend this  book. Maybe the movie is better.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This young woman was so well founded in solid, unconditional love from her mother, that she was able to weather the most horrendous imprisonment for the vast majority of her life. It's a life-lesson for EVERYone. I'm a grandmother now, and I was humbled by her ability to see things clearly, deal with them practically, and move ahead in her life now in a measured way, accepting the skilled help of others to truly overcome all that she lost. Her own 2 daughters are blessed to have such a wonderful mom. I can't say enough good about this story. Please read it. She's my model of grace, humility, strength and goodness.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book was a great read, even though I saw the movie before reading the book I knew the book would be better than the movie.
B00933JF74|5.0|I really enjoyed this one! I liked to play it when I was stressed and could easily get absorbed for an hour. I found it a great way to entertain myself and relax my stress away. I paid $1 and found it was well worth it.
B000068VHP|1.0|the one I received was horribly scratched and really unplayable. The seller refunded my money. I bought a new copy of it. As in shrink wrapped and brand new. This is the second cd in the last month that has been unplayable. I'm all for recycling, but I'm afraid I'm not going to waste my time on used Cd's anymore.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I would only recommend this &#34;horror&#34; to those who are scared easily. Most of the horror comes from clips you watch and not the story itself. By the time the movie started to seem intense I was too bored to care what happened.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is one of the most compelling books I have ever read. I was honored to be in the area of Chris's procession to his final resting place. Thank you Mr. Kyle for this book. I know that you were the best of the best and your heart was always about your country and your boys. Through this book you have made me realize what our Boys go through for our Country. Thank you for your service. This book moved me to tears and made my heart ache. May you Rest in Peace Chris Kyle.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I was introduced to Mahjong 6 months ago. This encourages the addiction!!  I am new to the world of apps and Kindle,and this game.  Will help me learn a comfort level.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you're a person that loves brain teasers, I highly recommend this game! It's a fun little puzzle that almost anyone can do! I like it almost as much as Sudoku!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's awesome.<br /><br />It's  like a real live horse in your game. Wish it was faster though.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Wow!! Great! It's a beautiful game! Between Sim City and City Ville, but this is the best! Bye bye bye.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Short, but very well thought out and some good ideas to put into practice.  Everyone should try to read this book.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|I love Gilmore Girls, it is such a guilty pleasure that I have enjoyed so much! The love and friendship of a single mother and her daughter has honestly made me jealous and wish i had the relationship with my mom like that. Mine is more like Lorelai and her mother. The love and protectiveness of a small town is like another family...a crazy family. That town definitely has its own uniqueness and i can see why Lorelai chose this town to live in it fits her quite well...<br /><br />This show has made me smile and cry and angry...but this last season has made me extremely disappointed and left feeling....how could they let this show go?!?! When its the last season of a series i always seem to take forever to watch it cuz i dont want to know how they make it end and will it be just as good as throughout the whole thing and will it answer everything....Well there was answers left unsaid and you end up thinking well what does really happen. For this kind of show I want to know and they just ended it up so quick and you could tell in my opinion that they didnt want it to end but they just wrapped it up as quickly as they can but try to leave the impression that they started with the show. and thats love, friendship, laughs and just a good feeling.<br /><br />Im definitely disappointed in how it ended. but it was a good series and all the other seasons are good and this season is good but just a sad one cuz of the ending just not how you picture this series to end i guess.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use.  Large buttons and larger viewing area are wonderful.  Has everything a person needs to perform any calculator function.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is awesome!! I love it so much!! I would so suggest it!!!! Please buy this app! It rocks!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Not enough review time. Had to purchase to play forward. What little there was, was boring. Other purchases are better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a precious book that brings us closer to our true essence and reality. Thank you Dr. Alexander. I have read many books in the subject but this is the one that have moved me more profoundly and it keeps me feeling closer to the Core.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive! I love how awesome the dragons look. I could think of a few more dragons though. One thing I don't like about this game is the fact that you have to pay for the food . You need lots and lots of it because your dragons eat a lot. Plus its hard to level up. I do,however, love the gifting gold feature. That's a plus! It's so fun, everyone should play it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  games is hilariously fun I like trainsssdddsssddrfhf kg McHugh Chan by by f2f h f2f r th ft f in
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a really good book and I will tell everyone one to read it thanks Jeff for a great book
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Interesting story. It is amazing he survived and was able to remember so much. Love Anthony and the Peppers! They played Key Arena and did not charge over 50$ a ticket. You can really admire a band that is not in it for the money so much. I think Anthony will look back on his life and see what an amazing trip he had
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but I want more stuff  I want mob eggs  and I made a zoo with mobs I Love minecraft
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is one of the best comedies ever written.  The crazy antics of the four main characters is beyond words.  Take Sheldon for instance, how can a genius be so stupid when it comes to common sense?  Along with that he is OCD, which drives everyone crazy.  Penny, the Nebraska born &#34;girl next door&#34; neighbor, and struggling wannabe actress/waitress adds to the zany comedy.  When you combine the characters with the spot on writing you get a mix of terrific fun and enjoyment.  This series made me actually laugh out loud.
1451627297|5.0|A fascinating read.  I always recommend it to my friends.  I hope it is made into a movie one day.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I guess I was expecting more given the subject and producer. I had been jonsing to watch this ever since seeing the first trailer/commercial on line before it came out. In all it was pretty formulaic and there weren't many surprises. In fact there was only one unexpected bit of verbal play. The plot 'twists' were easy to guess fairly quickly. It wasn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours but I'm glad I didn't pay full price in the theatre.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I love how you can interact with your horse. its just a really good game in general..
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Sinister really took me by surprise at how they were marketing like a monster/ghost movie but it was an inteligent murder mystery with a monster in it and no need for typical jumps, but builds to a very substatial ending explaing what had and was going on.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|First of all, I love a good mashup. DJ Dangermouse did a great job combining the Beatles and Jay-Z. But nobody should get away with taking existing perfection and trying to make it \\"slicker\\". George Martin had to have known on some level this was a pander to far. To hear the start of a song you have always loved, then hear it has been monkeyed with for a new cash grab by the label is putrid.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome! There are great 3-D pictures for kids all ages. It is pritty easy to get the coins and the power's are really cool.
1469203820|1.0|This is a review of the audiobook performance, and not a commentary on Rothfuss as a writer, nor this particular story.<br /><br />DO NOT get the audiobook, if you want to love The Name of the Wind like everyone else does.  This has got to be one of the worst pieces of voice casting ever.<br /><br />Looking for someone to narrate a book on the mating habits of tree frogs? This reader is your guy.<br />Maybe a book on economics, and their place in globalization?  Sure.<br /><br />But a fantasy book, with tons of characters from foreign lands ala George R. R. Martin's Ice & Fire series, is no place for this reader.<br /><br />He sounds like he's from Akron, OH.  And when the lead character's friends talk, they're from Brooklyn.<br /><br />If this fantasy book was set in 1976 on the mid-Atlantic coast, he MIGHT have a chance of pulling it off.  Sadly, his emotional expressiveness falls as equally flat as his lack of accents.<br /><br />To the publisher:  Fantasy Fiction.  Cast a British guy, please.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I found this album by listening to the Blue Man Group station on Pandora. I love the violin and Lindsey Stirling plays it so well! If you like the BMG or violins with an asian sounding influence, you'll love Lindsey Stirling.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've read all of Connelly's books and I liked most of them.  This one was no different.  Easy read, entertaining, suspenseful.  I would say that in general though, this one was a bit more predictable the some of the other Harry Bosch stories.  Perhaps because I know the writer well enough now that I know what to expect.  But still good book.
B004AO1FF6|5.0|This show is amazing and I've put it off for far too long. David Tennant is my favorite Doctor that I've seen so far. Donna is also my favorite companion. Sure Rose was the reboot (rebooted from the 60s show) start-up, Martha was an improvement in some ways; but Donna...Donna is HILARIOUS!<br /><br />I'm telling you, if you like Sci-Fi, go watch season 1 (with Christopher Eccleston) and build your way up to Season 4. YOU WILL LOVE IT!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I adore the characters, the storyline, the costumes. I cannot wait for more episodes! Everyone should enjoy this wonderful series.
B001HN690O|5.0|Great movie, has both types of formats which is nice- keep one at home and one in the car or give the other to a friend.
1439190275|5.0|This past month I have read this book and its follow up companion book \\"The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living\\" by Volek and Phinney (2011).  I read both books twice.  Both are excellent and prove their point by citing numerous medical studies to defend the efficacy of the Atkins nutritional approach.  Atkins is safe, effective, and sustainable.  The \\"Art and Science of Low carbohydrate Living\\" is directed to the medical practitioner, and is more of a \\"why Atkins works scientifically\\" book than this book which is a how to do Atkins lifestyle. This book does have two chapters at the end which are scientific in content.<br /><br />After reading both books, I conducted a search engine review for the words \\"Atkins side effects\\". It is quite informative read the short comings of many of these critiques, noting their anit-biasness, misinformation, and lack of understanding.  I wonder what percentage of these reviewers never read an Atkins book or never tried his diet. Bottom line: read the books first, and do not be misled by these types of comments.<br /><br />Furthermore, many of these reviewers that are anti-Atkins miss a major point of the Atkins nutritional approach.  Atkins is not just for losing weight.  It is also very successful in treating type 2 diabetes, and in numerous documented cases in both books, Atkins has put diabetes into remission and allowed the affected individuals to rid themselves of all diabetes medication.  Atkins is also beneficial to those individuals suffering from Metabolic syndrome.  Atkins can reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease.<br /><br />If you need to be convinced to try Atkins, read \\"The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living\\" book first.  If you are already convinced, lead with \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\", and then read \\"The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living\\".  Both books explain the possible side effects (fatigue, headaches, constipation, lethargy) and how to deal with them should they occur when initiating the Atkins plan.  Personally, I did not experience any side effects when initiating Phase 1 Induction.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best Bond film in a looog time!! Hope they keep them coming. Reception was unviewable  in prime time. Had to watch it the next afternoon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice game, great graphics, pretty realistic horse game. U wish you could free ride though. All in all, a fun game
1595825045|4.0|If you are a fan of the series, buy it. If you are an aspiring animator, buy it. If you watch the bonus material attached to DVDs, buy it. If you love process and what to know about the thinking process behind the series, buy it. - Enough said.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Such an inspirational and uplifting movie! Nanny McPhee Returns shows the positive element to &#34;nanny&#34; shows. It's entertaining as well as encouraging!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow its amazing I love one direction soo I cant believe that it is soo fun I love it hay
B0013ND30W|5.0|... I would suggest choosing this one.  This thing looks un-dadgum-real on Blu-ray disc.  It's not in my top 10 favorite Disney films, but it is my absolute favorite high definition presentation.  A lot of things converged to make the look so stunning.  They spent a ton of money and time on the film, they departed from the old Disney look and used instead a medieval aesthetic, and they widened the screen by a lot compared with the typical animated films.  (Listen to the audio commentary and you'll be blown away by what all went into making it look so incredible ... sometimes they'd complete one drawing in a day, which is good for ONE TWENTY-FOURTH OF ONE SECOND of film time!).<br /><br />Anyway, the Blu-ray Disney presentations I've seen are this one, Aristocats, Lady and the Tramp, and Cinderella.  And none of those other titles come anywhere near this one (even though they're all good).  Watching this, I was literally shaking my head in disbelief at what I was seeing.<br /><br />I can't compare it to Blu-rays like Beauty and the Beast and Lion King, which I'm sure must look amazing, too.  But this is like watching high art from some museum getting lit up and moved all around in front of you.  It's just jaw-dropping.  I'm glad I didn't ignore it just because I find the story a bit vanilla.  And actually, the story, and especially some of the dialogue, is better than I remembered.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Each of us can share - it is the process of someone giving and someone receiving. A greater society is one whereby giving and receiving are a choice - the decision to take action from one's heart...A fine film that tells a story about Love, about kindness and about being a greater society. Being 50 yrs old, having grown up in the south, having lived in LA 30 years and worked in &#34;The Industry&#34;  this film is a keeper for everyone. If you are from the south you'll catch humor that others will miss ! If you are a school teacher, it is a fine film for an essay assignment. The story told has something for every political point of view and celebrates the hero in our individual power and the hero of our once longheld national identity to 'lend a helping hand to those in need' and to give thanks for one's individual wealth by sharing some with those in need by individual acts of kindness and giving. This story says that anyone of us can make a difference if we choose and that &#34;In to the hands that give, the gift is given&#34;. So eloquently stated by Leann after a friend said &#34;You are changing that boys life&#34; and Leann responded, &#34;No, he's changing mine (for the betterment of her soul and values)&#34;. Leann demonstrates the power of love and acceptance when she meets Michaels mother...a mother reaching out to another mother and sharing the plight of motherhood. Great messages that each of us has the power within to live if we choose. Beautifully acted, tenderly told and captures out times.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was a wonderful escape from reality. The world created was lush, detailed and original. While the concept at first struck me as being similar to Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Cones\\" you soon learn that there's nothing to be afraid of and let yourself be enveloped in this book. It also slightly reminded me of Harry Potter with the main characters being \\"different\\" and not fitting in until the circus in the same way Harry didnt fit in until Hogwarts. I also really enjoyed the star crossed lovers plot line.<br />Overall a great read, pretty quick once you're into it and highly recommended!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|As always the Merlin series is great viewing. The quality of the recording is always very good. I am well pleased with this dvd set. Looking forward to the next season.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|We absolutely need to look for our silver linings.  This book makes you care about Pat and his journey. The journey is not all fairytale. Quick does a wonderful  job of keeping the journey realistic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love ittttt cute game simple wish you didn't have to pay for the gems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! otherwise it would be more fun to play
0739366408|5.0|Not your usual 'attack of the Zombies' yarn.  You read more of the average person's experiences, both regular 'working class' reports vs your higher ups tales.
0684803356|5.0|This is a tough book to write about. How many ways are there to say \\"brilliant\\"? This was a re-read for me of a war story and love story. The book far surpasses both. It was the first to describe war as it really is: with flawed heroes, horrible treatment of the civilian population by both sides, guerrillas who are both cruel and afraid, madmen in commanding positions, etc. It also tells about the Spanish Civil War, so for people are unaware that there actually was such a war, it is an eye-opener on the prelude to WWII. The book is appalling and beautiful at the same time. Please read it or re-read it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I never pay for games, but I bought this one due to all the positive reviews. I'm glad I did. Excellent game.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the headphones that came with the original Sony Walkmans in the 80's and they are STILL the best compact headphones.  Great sound, great comfort. Lightweight.  Great bass.  Beats all other headphones and earbuds HANDS DOWN!  And a GREAT PRICE TOO!  I would highly recommend.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am glad someone wrote about the true account of the killing of Bin Laden. I dontknowwhatwas so controversial about it. Didn't really seem to be any deep secrets in the book. Great read and very interesting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This was recommended by a friend who loved it and I love it now. It is very, very very informative.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Wonderful series.  I saw the movie, and then downloaded the books.  The words were so expressive it was as if I was watching the movie all over again.  Reading the second & third book, I was able to visualize what was happening.  Very expressive writing.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I love big, sprawling, \\"slow\\" Victorian tomes like George Eliot's \\"Middlemarch,\\" Thackeray's \\"Vanity Fair\\" and Dickens' \\"Bleak House.\\"  In fact, the syntax can be so convoluted that, especially in the instances of the aforementioned masters, every page is filled with action--if not at the level of \\"plot\\" at the more complex, multidimensional one of social relations and role-playing (and how well the Victorians understood not only the importance of constructing a \\"social persona\\" but of distinguishing it from the realm of internior desire and an \\"authentic self\\").  But also note the \\"action\\" of the sentences themselves--frequently the \\"main clause\\" is subordinate to dependent clauses and phrases, tributaries challenging us to locate meaning in the crevices and crannies that are routinely disregarded by the impatient residents of our current digital world where everyone is on a schedule that simply countenances no wasted time--not for a moment.  But the Victorians had time--lots of it--and as a result they frequently explored areas of human experience and individual consciousness that have since become out of bounds, or simply overlooked and forgotten, as we we are shoved along in our mono-dimensional, fast-moving but not necessarily dynamic, time-streams.<br /><br />When my wife became engaged by this series, I too \\"tried\\" to succumb, at least sufficiently to share her experience.  From the outset, I suspected a disparity between its popular success and the quality of the episodes themselves (I haven't noticed a run on Victorian novels recently).  But knowing that the writer of Robert Altman's quick, smart, endlessly revealing \\"Gosford Park\\" was also primary author of \\"Downton Abbey,\\" I was fully willing to give the series, in Coleridge's words, my \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\"<br /><br />The first show was in itself enough to cut the thread of my suspension.  By the third I was a confirmed \\"disbeliever.\\"  \\"Downton Abbey\\" struck me as  to the world of Victorian literature what the old \\"Classic Comic Books\\" were to a work like \\"Hamlet\\" or \\"Moby Dick&#34.  It's a caricature--and perhaps if it's sketchy, cartoonish, parodic quality were more apparent--to the actors, the writer, the viewers--it would serve--at least as effectively as a Monty Python movie--as a send-up of great Victorian literature (which few people read, unless its a manageable Austen novel). \\"Downton Abbey,\\" however entertaining, is not an accurate \\"imitation of life\\" let alone the \\"criticism of life\\" sought by the master Victorian storytellers.<br /><br />At least the series has confirmed my life-long admiration for Robert Altman, whose probing cameras and layered soundtrack in \\"Gosford Park\\" showed so much more in so much less time than this sprawling descendant set in the same time period.  Be prepared to watch the film several times if it doesn't delight after a single viewing (the screenplay is also a good bet: [[ASIN:1854596888 Gosford Park (Shooting Scripts)]].  Like those long and convoluted Victorian sentences, Altman's cinematic syntax can be so fast as to occasionally run away from the viewer.  But that heady, even vertiginous, experience, is closer to the reader's response to some of the best prose of Eliot, Thackeray, and Dickens than anything in this  \\"Downton Abbey\\" soap-opera, which is being passed off as high culture since its about the British, is on PBS, and is set in the late Victorian/early modern period.<br /><br />If \\"Gosford Park\\" proves elusive or inaccessible, and if Victorian novels don't hold the attention after the first 100 pages, there are far better representations of the period, its classes, its conflicts, its characters, and its lovers in John Fowles' \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman,\\" arguably one of the several \\"essential\\" novels written in English during the 20th century.  Even the play version of Bernard Pomerance's \\"The Elephant Man\\" reveals much of the Victorian period--it's respectable upper crust and its cursed downside, as told to us by John Merrick himself--a monster who comes to look normal compared to the grotesque deformities he observes in England during the reign of Queen Victoria.  (Joseph Conrad's \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" makes much the same point about Empire and Victorian society.)  Given the length of the Victorian period--and the \\"bigness\\" of England throughout the world at during this time, the challenge to represent that world would seem too great except for the most selective artists--Thackeray strikes me as comiing close in his \\"Vanity Fair.\\"  In film, few have represented Americans more clearly and comprehensively than Robert Altman does in \\"Nashville,\\" the city that serves as his microcosm, or \\"Vanity Fair,\\" for modern-day America, still an inexhaustible dream factory to some aspirants, a hubris-strewn battleground for others, such as the Tea-Party crowd. Even the film's last shot--starting with a steady camera aimed at Nashville's faux Parthenon, where an assassination has just occurred, then tilting upward to an all-blue open sky--encapsulates the meaning of the film--we recognize our sins and delusions prior to the camera's offering alternative and better illusions, perhaps the realization of an untapped potential, or of a \\"revised,\\" more equitable and constructive American dream than the one that leads back to the restrictive Nashville we have just experienced.<br /><br />Comparing a TV series with Victorian literary classics and esoteric, unpopular American films may not seem like a fruitful or fair exercise.  But it does bring to mind a question: if some artists can say so much in the space of a single novel or a 3-hour movie, how is it that \\"Downton Abbey\\" can say so little in three years?<br /><br />(I'm sorry mine is not an enthusiastic endorsement of the series, but I respect my room-mate's and others' views that are different from mine. Having once cracked the \\"Top 25\\" Amazon reviewer echelon, I no longer few compelled to write reviews that please--though it befuddles me why a difference of opinion should provoke negatives from some readers.  Better they write their own positive reviews in response to mine--perhaps I'll be persuaded to adopt their point of view.  Contrary to popular thought, great art does not necessarily endure unassisted.  It requires constant scrutiny, explanation, support.  The writer's job is not so much to \\"criticize\\" (which is less about disapproving that reading \\"closely\\") as to examine and teach.), as told to us by John Merrick himself--a monster who comes to look normal compared to the grotesque deformities he observes in England during the reign of Queen Victoria.

B002OQT928|4.0|Our 3 year old loves this movie.  We watch it a lot... Fortunately, it is enjoyable for adults also.  My only warning would be about a little crude humor for those of you who are really strict on this (a few passing gas remarks and such).

B000FC12ZA|5.0|Marlo writes a story that she says is fiction, but I believe there was more than a thread of truth in her book.  The native peoples have a sincerely honest outlook about the human experience.
0786962984|5.0|This is truly a very quick, simple, easy to use Dungeon board game. There are a variety of levels of characters to be played. We have played this game many times since it arrived, since game play truly can be between 30-45 mins. Not complicated to learn. A lot of fun even if players are not D&D fans.

B0008ENICU|5.0|Funny and sad  (but clever) story about men with absolutely no men in movie. Many of these women later became famous.
1933308087|4.0|I really like being able to draft my own blocks to the size I want them. This book shows you how to do that and is also a great source for finding out what a blocks name is and when it was first published. A good addition to any quilter collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|That abought covers it. It dosent have complicated rules or anything.  I downloaded it to get credits in another game, but now iv played it up to level 11

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Personally I think this is the best of Donal Fagen's four solo albums, but maybe because this is the newest one, or maybe it just is the best. Love it. Have been listening to it for many times in a row now, and it's got better and better.
B0083Z614S|4.0|A childhood favourite and a book that makes adults feel like kids again as they read! A great story about discovery and friendship

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Adventurous and edge of the chair book. I really liked it and I hope u do to. Really great book
B00A85EMVK|2.0|Bought this in anticipation of great 3D depth in the movie's dogfighting scenes. Wrong- the 3D action scenes werre no better than watching a 2D movie with a 3D upconverter. VERY disappointing.<br /><br />Leson to be learned here:  approach with much lowered expectations, any movie not originally shot in true, dual camera 3D. In fact, don't buy them at all.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|i cannot wait to purchase season 3!  i was sucked in on the first episode and it only gets better
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very enjoyable read for less than a cup of coffee.  This book would be a bargain at $9.99.  Thanks Andy!
B009CF7JDU|4.0|We never did get around to watching this when it came out in the 80's, so when I saw it listed on Amazon Instant Prime, we said, &#34;why not?&#34;<br /><br />It was pretty entertaining. I probably would have enjoyed it as a five star had I seen it back then, but with the advances in movie technology, we've become spoiled (plus we're older and wiser supposedly now), so I'll reserve that last star.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|A pretty decent horror film with a few jump scares but no real blood or gore. Worth a rent but a buy. Once you've seen it once, there's no reason to go back
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We used to have an original but gave it to my son. We tried the newer version but didn't care for it. We absolutely LOVE the good old original one again. Works great!
B000063V8S|5.0|Chose if this movies b/c I've been a Star Trek Fan for years. Makes you think that going inot space and living like that is possible. There is no part I like better then the rest.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you are a Rocky fan like my self you will enjoy this Blu Ray video.<br />I feel like I was viewing these films in the theater in 1976. Which I did!
B000062XFG|5.0|Chose if this movies because I've been a Star Trek Fan for years. Makes you think that going intot space and living like that is possible. There is no part I like better then the rest. I would definately recommend this to any Star Trek Fan. A totally great series.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Nice free game play until you run out of diamonds. Then it's the usual pay to play like so many others.
B000063V8R|5.0|Chose if this movies because I've been a Star Trek Fan for years. Makes you think that going intot space and living like that is possible. There is no part I like better then the rest. I would definately recommend this to any Star Trek Fan,
1419701533|5.0|I would like to say that this book is a great influence on boys between the age of 6 and 12 years . I brought this book as a gift for my 8 year old and he is constantly reading them. great buy.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a story everyone knows, but it's far more detailed in the book, I enjoyed it very much and highly reccomened it
B000W93CHC|5.0|I liked Pillars of the Earth but I loved World Without End.  Great writing style kept me glued to my Kindle Fire.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Exciting, suspenseful, and exhilarating! Another Beautiful love story. This one really pulled at the heart strings. Can't wait to see the movie!
B0063M22QO|4.0|interesting.  However, there are not enough levels in the original.  Makes it necessary to purchase the next game to advance.
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|first heard the vaccines do &#34;if you wanna&#34; on letterman. immediatley downloaded &#34;what did you expect from the vaccines?&#34; fell in love with it. short, punchy powerpop songs with intelligent and fun lyrics. 30 years ago it would have been new wave. &#34;come of age&#34; is a more mature album but looses nothing of the first albums punch. my only dillema is which one to listen to. they are both awesome!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I. Ought this because my daughter was raving about it. It'/s typical teen fiction - a straight forward melodrama, very predictable, with characters caricatured.  Not a bad way to spend a few hours but not memorable or a re-reader.
0425252868|4.0|Although the incident central to the story is not told until well into the book, the preceding chapters successfully provide the background to Stigler's sense of chivalry. The close involvement of well known Luftwaffe personalities such as Galland and Goering in the story, and the politics involved, were an unexpected and revealing aspect of the book. Given that a number of photos of &#34;Ye Olde Pub&#34; were known to have been taken after this mission, it is unfortunate none were available for inclusion in the book, although the painting is a worthy substitute. This story of former enemies later meeting as friends is not unique (eg. RAF Coastal Command crews dropping life rafts to U-boat crews and meeting post-war), so one wonders how many similar stories remain untold? Thanks to Adam Makos for so diligently searching out this particular one.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|With masterful use of language, gentle wit, and deep knowledge of biology, psychology, and history, Dr Dawkins builds a persuasive and thought-provoking argument.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a very great read and hard to put down. There are many moments that touch your heart and others that makes you appreciate life and love.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was nothing like anything I have ever read from him. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a great page turner.
0547848412|4.0|It was good read. I have not seen the movie, wanted to read the book first. I'm not certain a movie can do it justice. Story is a sixteen year old cast away on a lifeboat with several zoo animals including a bengal tiger. Good writing, not verbose, story moves along well. I particularly liked Pi's description of the tiger when he ascertains that he's onboard, \\"his head was the size of the planet Jupiter, his paws volumes of Encyclopedia Brittanica.\\" The ending isn't great, they rarely are, but I did enjoy the read. I will recommend this book to my teenaged grandson.
0679720200|4.0|Story of a man completely indifferent to life. The author gives you one man's point of view of life and it's hard not to admire some of this attributes. A very conflicting character, one who it's completely indifferent to life, yet always finding a way to be content. Is he genuinely content? I don't know, but it's a short story that makes you think about life.
B005IQZB14|4.0|If you're looking to read about the adventures of hiking the PCT, there are other books to go to first. While Ms. Strayed gives plenty of glimpses and insight into what hiking the PCT must be like, that it not the essential of her story. Rather, the trail is more of a metaphor for getting somewhere despite the desperate feeling of being lost which is exactly where Ms. Strayed was prior to her journey. Her raw honesty and forthrightness about her life, her family, her shortcomings, are what make this book so engaging. You can't help but feel like you want to give her a big hug and then do what you can to help her find her way. Of course she does find her way, but her willingness to be open the possibilities and what others have to offer is what makes her journey all more enriching.<br /><br />As an author, Ms. Strayed's gift and ability to put to words the complete, unfiltered, yet thoughtful bearing of her soul is what I found most beautiful. With this as her first book, she exhibits the qualities of a very promising writer, and I sincerely hope we see more from her, either fiction or non-fiction. I'm giving 4 stars because I felt there were some parts lacked the same level of intensity and depth which gave the book at times a bit of a rushed or hurried feel. This was my impression especially at the end of the book, I felt it feel somewhat flat as if Ms. Strayed needed to quickly wrap things up to make a deadline. I appreciate that her next chapter was just opening but the last bit of the book lacked a lot of the rich introspection found in the earlier parts of the book.
0231161166|2.0|This book was overall a disappointment. I found the author really struggled trying to find who she wanted the book to appeal to. In some chapters/sections she gives these terribly tacky and simplistic analogies to \\"help\\" the reader understand these experiments/results. Other chapters are bogged down with excessive nomenclature and overly detailed procedures with how the experiments were conducted. Also the book contained a serious lack of diagrams that would have helped the explanations. Look elsewhere.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|I'm not usually a greatest hits guy, but I heard that this was a great box, and it sure is. The Shepard Fairey-designed packaging is beautiful. To pull this box off the shelf and open it up is an exciting experience. And then there's the sound. These songs have never sounded better on any format. This may be the most impressive sounding vinyl in my collection. The vinyl is dead silent and the music sounds huge and detailed. There are great songs missing, but until we get all Led Zep albums reissued again on vinyl, this set is a must-own.
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens speaks from the heart in his writing and he bears all in this extremely tiny but complex book relating to life. He focuses on his battle with cancer, the complications of treatment, some fears that result and his opinions of his critics and friends when faced with this dreadful disease. It's dark, it's real and it's Hitchens.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Parents generally take their children for granted, that they will always be there, that they don't hurt inside and that they will grow up to do and be all the things we hoped for. We are all so busy with the living of our lives that we miss what is going on in their lives and we just don't stop really look. This book makes you think \\"what if.\\"
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I finally joined the 21st century and got signed up for ebay.  My kids use it all the time.  I can see now how they got hooked on it.
0765325950|5.0|I have been a fan if Jordan's work for over a decade and Sanderson did a great job finish this epic series.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book just a few days after Chris Kyle's death.  What a tragic and unfitting death for a warrior legend.  This is a gripping autobiography of the most prolific sniper in U.S. history.  Admittedly, Chris' bloodlust and \\"addiction\\" to war is a bit frightening at times.  His passion for killing and incessant need to be in harms way goes against the basic drive most of us have for self preservation.  I think more than anything, this book is an excellent psychological profile of a Navy SEAL sniper.  It's clear that the U.S. military, in particular the Navy SEALS training, is excellent at producing killing machines.  But in the end we see the emotional and physical toll that that years of war take on the man and his family.  His marriage, body, and mind pay a high price for his service.  Although it's not officiallly metioned in the book, he undoubtedly suffers PTSD and carries many permanent \\"scars\\" from the war.  We see his struggles to return to civilian life and the constant draw of the battlefield in spite of his battered body and soul. May you now rest in peace.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Pretentious and stiff.  Beautiful costuming with nothing underneath, a swallow and hollow interpretation of a great story.  This shows that even with great actors one needs coherent direction and writing.  Honestly after the first 10 minutes felt like it was unwatchable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun game.  It is one you can win at if you play your cards right.  Anyone looking for a fun game should try this one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Mr. Connelly or should I say, Harry Bosch has done it again.  Well thought out plot with twist and turns in an exciting story.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|Music is overshadowed by drummer bashing the cymbals in almost every song, and accompanying music in general being a bit overpowering in relation to vocals. In some reviews, the lead singer has been compared to Janis Joplin......not yet........not even close. Hopefully their next album will be better organized, the first one is the first one afterall. Hope they &#34;make it&#34;.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Love the music! The storyline and characters bring the songs to life. I'm generally not a huge fan of Tom Cruise but I thought he was fabulous in this movie.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Good solid CD by Bonnie. She does quite a few songs (done first by other artists), and the arrangements were a bit unusual, perhaps will grow on me as I listen to them more often. All songs ok, some with typical super Raitt lyrics, but CD is not her best. Of course with Raitt fans, she continues to &#34;lead our way&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|well it's better than no horse at all! This game keeps your attention for a while if you love horses.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a thriller unlike anything else that I've read and I read a lot. Unexpected plot twists that will keep you guessing and an ending that will keep you wanting more.
B001782N4A|5.0|I was surprised by the size of the product because I assumed that it was minor.<br />However the amount was paid with 100% taxes and charge me more taxes here in Brazil as if they had not been paid.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What a disappointment !!<br /><br />I was expecting to be at least marginally turned on but this book is so ridiculously far fetched and inane that there  is no way anyone unless totally desperate could get turned on.<br /><br />It is poorly written ,repetitive drivel ,I would insult Mills and Boon if I said it was one of their's on steroids.<br /><br />BUT the thing I found most annoying was the unsubtle marketing push on well  known products that I can only assume the writer got some sort of compensation for.<br /><br />I cannot believe this has had the success it has had .
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun for the whole family. I really enjoy this game. it has a bit of lag but still very enjoyable.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|I found I couldn't put it down so would recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mystery books. Well written
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The kids play this all the time and then got me hooked.  It’s fun and time consuming.  You don’t realize it until 30 minutes have passed.  Kids will love it.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush albums 2112, Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres were all similar in theme.  Great lyrics and music so if you like this one, check out those also.  Their first album &#34;Rush&#34;, was different than these but also great.
030758836X|3.0|I bought this book because it was such a hit with other readers and adopted it for our book club.  I have to say that I was soooo... disappointed in the read.  The book takes a while to warm up in the beginning but when it does (about half way through) it really gets good.  The only think I didn’t like was the ending.  I felt like after putting so much effort to make through the book, the ending would be fantastic.  Needless to say I was very embarrassed to have suggested it to the book club.
B008RYN44U|5.0|this woman and her group are keeping the past alive! i am touched by this album. i cant even believe anyone has the nerve to say this wasnt a good album.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The BBC drama's are among the best quality programming in the world and this one is no exception.  Really an interesting window into how the aristocracy of the time lived and thought.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I am so captivated by the story line but hugely disappointed at the unexpected demise of Matthew. It seems as though every series believes they need to end the season with a death. So be it! My only regret is that you chose a character that exemplified the epitome of a gentleman.. Matthew represented, for me, kindness, gallantry and romance. What a pity that he is gone.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|The special effects are good.  Let's just say the reviews for this movie were pretty darn accurate, but still if you grew up reading the Green Lantern comics you will want to watch it at least once.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this app way better than temple run. you should download it but watch out if you let other people play it.....I let people on the bus play it and I had 29 gems and now I have 1 :(
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The beginning of the book was boring and repetitive especially in the sex scenes which there were a lot.  Wonder when they had time to live life.  The ending was  good but not worth the money on the book to get to the end.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Kept me interested from start to finish.  Had me thinking along other lines as to what was going to happen. Recommended.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I do not read romance novels but decided to give this a try.  I was very pleased with the story and all the sex involved.  It was a well written book in my opinion.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|One of those movies that actually kept us both awake. Very good. Great acting as well. Definitely watch it. Ok.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|great fun.  I like it better than cut the rope because there is no timing and its easier to play
B005VPRDAY|5.0|These are nice girly legos, she put the house and car together quickly and was very proud of herself. They are a good value, lots more room in the tub for more to add.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|The kids are so excited about this game, we haven't played it yet but anything with legos is a win for all of the kids (ages 6-10). It came on time and in great condition.
B005LAIH2C|1.0|Ever wonder what happened to Hansel and Gretel after they burned the witch?  They became world renowned witch hunters and child rescuers.  But somewhere along the line they must have gone into a time-warp to 21st century Hollywood where they lost their German accents, and their rustic innocence and learned how to become Hollywood hipsters who traded in their peasant clothing for designer leather pants and jackets.  It was amazing how a little peasant girl was transformed into Hollywood hottie Gretel with the  big attitude and the potty mouth that goes along with it.  Watching her strut around with the crossbow was like watching a clone of Angelina Jolie's character, Salt, only with the Black Forest of medieval Germany as a backdrop.<br /><br />The main part of the movie begins when hottie Gretel and hunky Hansel strut into a dirty, run-down village which is being plagued by witches.  They encounter the sheriff who is the stereotypical anal authority figure that can be found in all of these type of movies.  The bumbling sheriff and the stereotypical white-trash townfolk are about to kill a suspected witch when Gretel sticks a multi-barelled he-man gun against his neck and threatens to blow his brains out all over these \\"f-ing hillbillies\\".  She then breaks his nose with a head-butt.  From that moment on, I was rooting for the witches.  The hipsters make it clear to these cretinous, dim-witted hillbillies that if they want to save their children, we're in charge, you should be grateful, and stay out of our way.<br /><br />There are alot of high-tech, special effect action scenes, but there is not much of a plot to this story and the acting is atrocious.  Actually, it was comical to see thousand year old kung fu, ninja witches who looked like prunes with rotten teeth doing flying, leaping twirling kicks and backflips that would have made Bruce Lee look like a geriatric.  Then they hop on a broom that can go mach 3 through the Black Forest without hitting any branches.Although the witches prove to be formidable opponents, they are no match for hottie Gretel and hunky Hansel who are ninja warriors in their own right armed with gattling guns, fully automatic crossbows and the latest medieval weaponry a bag of gold can buy.  (They must have learned their martial arts skills  during their time warp in Hollywood.)<br /><br />Of course we must be sensitive to the fact that it was their abandonement by their parents which gave them a complex and made them neurotic over-achievers.  In one supposedly touching scene we learn the truth about why their parents had to abandon them.  However, the hero and heroine of this movie are a couple of nauseatingly narcissistic and arrogant characters that the rest of us mere mortals will never be able to identify ourselves with.  If you have an IQ above the level of a turnip, take a pass on this one.  It is another cornball action flick.  If it were any more cornball, it could have been a great Mel Brooks type spoof.<br /><br />Walt Disney did justice to the folktales of The Brothers Grimm.  If they could see this thing they'd be rolling in their graves.
B004I744AS|5.0|I would honesty recommended this app to anyone. It works great and it goes above and beyond a dictionary app.
B007REV4T8|5.0|If not, do not even bother reading this, I need not explain.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, does his usual terrific job of acting. Judy Dench as well, aka &#34;M,&#34; is absolutely flawless. Take the two of these actors and you have a masterpiece flick. What Van Gogh did on canvass, these two actors (Daniel Craig and Judy Dench) do on the screen. Fabulous sit at the edge of your seat movie that if you are a Bond lover, as I am, you HAVE TO see, and also own the movie, as well. This one will be a future classic.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Worst 99 cents I ever spent!!! Thought I had a game to play for several days.....WRONG! Got one evening out of it and I was finished with it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig was excellent in the latest Bond saga movie, Sky Fall. Though a very gritty and action packed movie to watch, we see that James Bond is not so bullet proof after all and acceptable to time and age. Many things play out to it's conclusion regarding James Bond's health, age, and mental status. I recommend this movie for those die hard Bond fans who never got the chance to watch on it on big screen or simply thought it was one of those Bond films again. You won't be disappointed and strongly suggest to really spare the time to watch it without interruptions, like phone calls, bathroom or breaking up kid fights... It'a a very entertaining movie to watch...Well done Daniel Craig.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|LOW START. NOT MUCH BACKGROUND, NOT VERY &#34;SCIENCE FICTION&#34;. ENTERTAINING AND OFTEN EXCITING. READ ON A KINDLE,WHICH IS EASY TO RAPID THROUGH THE SLOWER STUFF.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The first 30 or so chapters I had to force myself to read! Oh how glad I am that I got pass them to one of the best reads in quiet some time now.
B00992CF6W|4.0|THIS IS MY 3YR &15YR SONS FAVORITE GAME! THEY LOVE IT! HOWEVER, IT ISNT VERY ME FREINDLY, BECAUSE I CANT FIGURE HOW THEY DO IT. LOL
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game just the fact that you can free Rome  made me get it. It felt like a console game get this game
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|All I can say. I loved this book as a young child and I still do as an adult. Great read!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Wes Anderson's best film yet.  Edward Norton with a fantastic performance, and the kids are great. Would definitely watch again.
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|Blade Runner is a ground-breaking sci-fi noire thriller by director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Prometheus). The film features stunning visuals depicting a futuristic city-scape, along with moody synth music, which creates a great atmosphere. Good performances all around from the cast though the script can be dry at times and the plot slow. I watched this film as a stream on this site and the quality was a pixelated mess, I've seen clearer VHS tapes, hence the lower score. If you're interested in seeing this movie I recommend it in an HD format.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't live without SwiftKey.. So simple and close to perfection... Love Urdu Language. Tried a lot other keyboards, but always came back to  SwiftKey.
B008AT71WI|5.0|If only all movies were this much fun. This horror themed musical features an amazing ensemble cast, an award winning soundtrack, and jaw-dropping special effects that'll leave you wondering how they pulled some things off without today's digital effects. This film is a must-own in my opinion, and it doesn't in a better form than this. It comes in a booklet featuring production stills and promotional cast photos. The disc is stuffed with all manner of special features, not the least of which is the films original ending which was essentially lost for over 2 decades, now fully restored and available to watch as part of the film.
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this video for my kids and they love it! It is very cute! Even my husband doesn't mind watching it with the kids!
B005LAII80|4.0|If you're not one to shy away from movie violence, Dredd is a very well done, straightforward sci-fi action film with a few fresh ideas thrown into the mix. The plot is relatively simple but well executed, and the cast does an admirable job with the material. I don't have a 3D system at home but from my experience seeing this in the theater, the 3D is top-notch. It's crystal clear, properly utilized, and adds to the experience rather than being a distraction. The quality of the HD film stands up nicely, though the disc lacks any substantial bonus features, not even a commentary. All around it's a solid action flick that's worth repeated viewings, so i recommend picking this up.
0307730697|5.0|Beginning with, and as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, Americans have become more familiar with an altogether different type of war: the war on terror. Through the years since, mainstream media has covered this war in excruciating detail. We have become familiar with the layout of Afghanistan and Iraq, the basic practices and tactics of the Taliban and other insurgent groups, and more familiar the military commands responsible for fighting this war on the ground and in the air. What has been lacking through the years of war reporting are the personal stories of courage, heroism, valor, and sacrifice. One such story has been written by New York Times best-selling author Eric Blehm. He has written a phenomenal book entitled, \\"Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Operator Adam Brown\\". Blehm describes the life Adam Brown beginning with his childhood days in Arkansas and ending with his military service as a SEAL operating in Afghanistan. The years in between tell the story of the human side of Adam Brown.<br /><br />The first part of the book deals with his early years growing up in Arkansas. Adam grew up as a carefree and competitive youth. Whether playing football or jumping from a bridge, he always had to do it first and better. In his early college days, while searching for some direction in his life, Adam tried and became addicted to drugs. Blehm does a great job of sharing his struggles with drugs and the effects it had on the entire family. At his lowest, his parents allowed him to remain in jail after being arrested. While in jail, Adam accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and his life took on a new focus and meaning. He joined Teen Challenge and began the process of kicking his drug habit. It was also during this time that he met his wife Kelly who would become the rock and support Adam would need in the years to come. Shortly after, a friend mentioned joining the Navy. Adam did. He was not satisfied with just being in the Navy, he wanted to be the best in the Navy. Adam wanted to be a Navy SEAL. The story moves along as Adam graduates from boot camp, finishes A-school, and eventually finishes BUD/S, which is the Navy SEAL's training school. My words cannot describe the pain, discomfort, stress, and pressure that Adam endured while in SEAL training. Blehm tells the story beautifully. I especially like how the author tells the story of Adam and his wife Kelly growing closer and of their \\"normal\\" life in the midst of chaos.<br /><br />Adam earned his Trident and become a SEAL. It is during this part of the story that Adam's \\"no-quit\\" and \\"never give up\\" mentality is fully brought to light. During training accidents, Adam severed four fingers on his right hand, his shooting hand. After surgery, Adam learned to shoot with his non-dominant hand. Adam also injured his right eye, his dominant shooting eye and although having extensive surgeries, he lost his right eye. During this time, Adam was not satisfied with just being a SEAL, he wanted more. With seemingly insurmountable odds against him, Adam trained for and became a member of DEVGRU, also known as Seal Team Six. With SEALs being the top 1% of all Special Forces operators, Seal Team Six is the top 1% of that 1%.<br />The last few chapters are extremely emotional. Blehm continues to show Adam's human side by describing Adam's relationship with his wife and children. I am not going to write about the events of Adam's death in Afghanistan. It is a story you must read for yourself. In these last chapters, there is a twist in the story that you will not see coming.<br /><br />\\"Fearless\\" is an excellent book. Eric Blehm has written an honest, gripping, inspirational, and smart book. What makes this book so successful is that the author has done his homework. Through extensive research and interviews with Adam's fellow operators, Blehm sought to be true to every step of SEAL life. The author expertly weaves Adam's faith, family, and devotion to duty into a beautiful story. As a former Marine and now a Christian pastor, I identified with this story on many levels. I cried. I laughed. \\"Fearless\\" is a book that demonstrates what is right with our military today. Go get this book today.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers as part of their Blogger Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Every now and then I like to read the books my grandchildren are reading.  I enjoyed this entire series and was relieved to find the numerous casualties treated in an acceptable manner for a twelve year old boy.
B000FC12YQ|4.0|I thought this was an interesting and fun to read Agatha Christie, even though it broke many of the rules of British mystery writing.  I enjoy Poirot more on film than reading as his character comes through more if you can see him.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I love this book -- got it during my trip to India and couldn't put it down. A little long but such fantastic writing. I'm glad I have more to go.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I am obviously late to the Breaking Bad party, but now that I have started watching, I LOVE IT!! This show will go down as one of the best ever on tv!!
B008XG1X18|2.0|the updated version keeps freezing. wish I could get the old version back!! other than that...  pintrest is a very addictive app!
B0043EV774|5.0|I hated this movie when I saw it on DVD, but the 3D is some of the best work out there and just really gets you into the movie. A must have!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Some people complained that it would lose the signal occasionally, I haven't lost connection once while on my computer, but sometimes I will in another room. For gaming...Awesome! The surround sound is breathtaking, and adjustable bass is a great feature for music.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Awesome!!!! One word....The best TB and Headset out!!! Setting 4-Bass bomm and trble boost. Beats all even the wireless PS3 99.99 one. Louder, more bass, more options for custimization.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House was a good and entertaining  read.  I felt it could have gone a bit further into Marshall's character in order to explain his horrible behavior as  we were only able to guess at what atrocities went on behind closed<br />doors and therefore,  that was the reason for his violent outbursts.<br /><br />I also like happy endings and was disappointed to read that Lavinia was alone at the end.  After all that misery, it would<br />have been nice to read she had paired up with Will at the end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really fun ! I find myself playing along with my daughter. Realistic and the horses are so cool. Takes a little time to get points and stuff but once you get going it gets easier.
B001XUPF2O|4.0|A very good movie if you like this kind of unbelievable action.  At times the &#34;unbelievable&#34; was a little over the top.  The joker did a fantastic job in his role.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is only the second Honor Harrington book I have read. I will read more as I can afford them because I like the premise of the story line. This one was especially interesting in light of the \\"sexist\\" attitude of the people she defended. Once it was explained in depth why the attitude of the people existed, I realized how true to life it is. Such a society not only could exist, it already does exist.<br /><br />But, this is not just a sociological sifi novel. The action is great, although I am overwhelmed by the technical aspects. (That is my failing as I have never had anyone school me in scientific realms of speculative space travel.) Battle scenes are believable. Strengths and weaknesses are shown as a double edged sword, which indeed they are in any battle.<br /><br />I like the characters and had no difficulty adjoining myself to their thoughts and actions. They have Personality! Some tech sifi authors forget to dress out the characters in lieu of creating visible battle engagements. (Not all of them by any means.)<br /><br />I have become an Honor Harrington fan. Thank you David Weber.<br /><br />Lynn<br /><br />P.S. David, I also hail from Cleveland but I have returned to Ohio after my southern stints. Trust me, you are not missing much with regard to winter cold and snow.  ;-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Charmed by each character. Loved the ending. Sparks never lets me down.  Would recommend.  Waiting for the movie 's release.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Rango was a good watch, funny!  Animated fun for the whole family.  Johnny Deep as the voice of Rango was great.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It is a fun game. Kept me interested! I want to play more. I could not put the game down.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is easy to follow and has a decent story line.  One of the best for games like it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty cool and very realistic. It's like you are actually taking care of a real horse it's awesome!
B00B769XB8|1.0|I really was looking forward to this, saw it in IMAX 3D.<br />What sort of numb skulls believe it`s ok to introduce 21st century technology into a Grimms tale? There must have been a real absence of good ideas to make this story work on it`s own.<br />The movie is packed with all sorts of great action and special effects. The story and acting is good, but the whole character of the original tale is distroyed by the unneccesary introduction of 21st century gagets. Saddened and ruined the experience for me. I'm enormously dissapointed by this movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is great!! You can adjust graphics and the characters are the same only more detailed. My only complaint is the difficulty in shifting sides. The scenes are cool and fresh, though the movements are a little jerky and slow.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|This movie is very good. I liked the naural setting in the mountains, the depiction of honor. Marky-Mark is a good actor. The ending was abrupt and simple.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it you will never run out of games and you will love it by the time you start this game and its free how much better can that be.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please make the real android app available on the kindle!! Such a terrible user experience. The news feed loads occassionally and always eventually stops. Awful.
B002E5N6CI|5.0|I have no problem recommending Isaac's music to anyone especially to those who think rap songs were the first songs to have a beat.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|The app worked great, until it needed to be updated. I write stories a lot, so when it needed to be updated. I lost EVERYTHING! I'm lucky that I remembered most of it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game. The option to have a unicorn is awesome and the competitions are easy. I love this game.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If u r a puzzle lover this is a must app. Many free puzzles and paid one's r reasonably priced. I'm hooked!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an extremely fun sequel to Temple Run! The graphics are simply amazing. There is more obstacles that make it more challenging. The game is brighter then Temple Run. This  game is very addicting and I cannot stop playing it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son and I love to play subway surfers. It keeps us entertained for hours<br />Great fun sand great game
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent plot. Very enjoyable read. First time with this author and won't be the last. Looking forward to the next one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is amazing to me that a person who is a scientist, who was a non believer, could take such a journey and come back completely convinced that there is an existence beyond death. I believe there is life after death and I believe all of us are connected. If you are a believer and a spiritual person, you will love this book!
B007N85POS|5.0|I don't normally play games (or write reviews) I just download for the kids. This is more fun than the original, and a bit easier for little ones and challenged adults.  Loved the movie Rio and the music and scenes are cute.
1609613937|5.0|Written in an easy-to-read style. Covers the health benefits of eating a plant-based diet for yourself and the planet. Highly recommended! I really enjoyed learning from this book and the eating guidelines and recipes have improved my health immensely.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wonderfully made documentary, inspiring look at the life of a true artist and his devotion to his music. Had me searching for Rodriguez music within minutes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game it's a lot like temple run but it should have levels and you need alot of things to get other people
B00479SVBU|5.0|Bought this about eight months ago. For some reason it would not read sd cards. I contacted customer support who suggested some remedies. Still wouldn't work. They sent me a new one in less than a week. I download audio books and old time radio programs which are great to listen to on long trips. If the frequency starts to bleed I can simply choose another from the memory [it will store 4]. Highly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game doesn't look like it at first but you know it gets addicting!! Woop woop woop woop!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Whether you believe everything he has to say, this books makes you really think about the possibilities. And his story is truly inspirational.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game out of all of my apps. I would rate this more than 5 stars. This is just awesome.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've wasted a lot of time on this app but have found many new recipes and crafts to try. I have also found a Loy of cleaning tips and tricks.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|The clever staging did not enhance the story but was appreciated for its own sake.  It confused the story line.  I would give high artistic marks but but low marks on effective capturing the audience with the story being told.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Did I expect this to be a feel good story¿ This is my first Jodi Picoult novel. She is very clearly a gifted author. I think however, that I will take a break from this much realism!
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I think this is a much better alternative to my Sprint phone's built in browser. My favorite feature is being able to open up links and photos in new tabs so I can look at them later
B005LAII8A|1.0|The disk won't play and it is beyond the return policy date. I would like another DVD to replace this item.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|this is a quick read. only few hours. entertaining as grisham always is but definitely not one of his best.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was awesome. but sometimes bee<br />fore I even got to play it would crash I have to unistall it and lose all my progress
B000031EGV|5.0|Hard not to like Robin Williams!  &#34;Creative&#34; movie.  Something the whole family can watch and wonder (at/with).  One of the outstanding, unusual movies to really enjoy.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I got this book as a Christmas gift last year and so I read it out of a sense of obligation more than any genuine interest. (Is that bad?)<br /><br />Having read it, it's interesting enough. The plot centers around a large-ish group of characters representing different classes in England (Wales), Germany, and Russia on the eve of World War I. This is a time of great societal upheaval and we experience this tumult from their various perspectives.<br /><br />Not all of these narratives are equal in quality due to the unevenness of the characters. Some, such as the Russian brothers Lev and Grigori Peshkov, I found more interesting than others. Other, especially Earl Fitzherbert, much less so since they seemed to exist to conform to negative stereotypes. Fitzherbert's sister, Maud, the suffragette marries a German nobleman, Walter Von Ulrich, the Earl's schoolboy friend from Eton. Their secret yearnings as they are separated by the war provide some of the more tedious passages in the book.<br /><br />The plot is largely dictated by the history of the period and it's interesting how the main characters interact with real-life historical figures. Again, for me, the most interesting of these is Gregori Peshkov who becomes a central figure in the Russian Revolution.<br /><br />The narrative carries through the end of 1924 with the withdrawal from Russia of the European powers and the victory of Lenin and the Bolsheviks.<br /><br />'Fall of Giants' is the first volume of Follett's 'Century' trilogy so presumably the next volume will tackle WWII and the third carrying through Vietnam. I am not sure I will finish the trilogy. It's not a bad story but it's been done better (albeit on a smaller scale) by Herman Wouk in 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance'.
B007SGM084|5.0|This product was as advertised and was delivered on time. It was easy to order and the picture and description matched what arrived.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is a relaxing pastime. the colors are great. the choices let me share with my young kids.lots of fun.
B000VUCIZO|3.0|A good Saturday afternoon book. I expect there is other books written with more interesting detail. However I don't regret purchasing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of Fun, just like the ones you play at the fair. I only wish there was more free coins.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|The casting on this series is what makes it so successful.  It will be interesting to see ho the plot morphs through the timeline.
0307887960|5.0|At a certain time of life, weight loss becomes almost impossible. This diet has been working for me (although probably slower than for younger people). I like the fact that it calls for mostly regular food. I have been able to follow it for a month now with few problems (OK - I cheated on Valentine's Day!).
1401224792|1.0|This is the worst excuse for a Fables spin off that I have ever seen. The story starts with a very interesting premise, however it quickly becomes entangled in one fallacy after another. For example [warning this isn't really a spoiler because it's information that has been essentially presented in the Fables main story line, however it is made pretty explicit in this story for the first time overall that I am aware of] werewolves apparently can regenerate from most anything other than fire and silver bullets according to the Fables mythology, and yet inexplicably Bigby is able to totally kill other werewolves just by ripping them apart...the story totally contradicts itself. This is just one example, of point after point in which the story just totally ruins itself with utterly sloppy writing. I would not recommend buying this product as it's not something anyone would probably want to reread. I got it mostly because I like collecting the Fables series and this is part of that series, otherwise, I'd probably give it away...but then that would be cruel to the recipient...
B009RWPAA2|5.0|This is my new favorite album. So original. Makes you wonder, &#34;Where does this stuff come from?.&#34; PURE MAGIC! I had to buy an extra copy on vinyl!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Been playing for months now... never gets old! Lord of fun and very immersive. The rewards and new levels are very creative. Love it!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|This sequence goes more to the internals of the club than anything else. I found this interesting, and it may not go in the direction you like. Still I liked it, makes me want to get on my Harley and ride!
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|I thought this was pretty eerie and spooky until the last 20 minutes or so. Then the plot changed some and disappointed me a bit. Overall a decent thriller.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I have not played the first Mysteryville but have played another hidden object game by the same developer (which had been my first Android hidden object game). Since then, I have tried similar games from other developers and find that I prefer the graphics, game play, story and variety of Mysteryville 2 and its ilk. This should provide hours of entertainment for those who enjoy hidden object games.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story is slow to progress, the first half.  It doesn't start getting exciting until mid book, then the book is hard to put down.  Anxiously awaiting book 3 in June!
B00BESCJII|5.0|We loved this movie, it was funny and moving and sensitive to the trails and tribulations of high school and teenage problems of belonging. It had great depth of charter as each of the leads let you discover their hidden pain.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great quick read. Only thing that would have made it 5 stars would to have heard just a little more closure at the end when he finally gets his silver lining.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Who doesn't Love American Horror Story? I missed the first couple episodes, so I went ahead and got them from here. There was nothing wrong with the picture, smooth sound.. great buy!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is one of the best stop motion animation movies that I have seen in a long time.  I am glad that Tim Burton still uses this medium to make great movies.  So cute and you fall instantly in love with all the characters in this movie.  A++ all around.
B009LVFIC4|5.0|It is designed to collapse over the lens evidently; wasn't expecting that.  That is a nice feature because I can store it on the lens without having to remove it.
B009ME47H2|5.0|It has worked flawlessly.  I loaded this app on my kindle to record medical data and office visits so I am thrilled that it has worked perfectly every time for me.  Great app and would highly recommend it. Easy to use.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I haven't watched a Bond movie in years and after Skyfall I have decided I need to go back and watch the last two Daniel Craig Bond movies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romance novel with a little suspense! Easy read, as always with his books. Hope the movie follows the book.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This soundtrack really can bring excitement to the game from the regular battles to the boss fights. I really like it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book & the twisted life and love lessons! I cannot imagine that the movie version is capable of capturing the true essence of emotion on each page. I've yet to see the movie version, and I don't think I will :)
B008XX6J4C|4.0|still loved listening to the music on CD, but not as captivating as You Tube. Slow postage, over a month
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just love this app, use it everyday to listen to the bible when I workout.  Have never had any problems with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Prepare for a cliff hanger!!! This is a great sequel.<br /><br /> Writing randomness to reach required word limits. Yay.  And done!
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game,but if you do not want to spend any real money it will take a long time to finish.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a wonderful classic! I read this book as a child and when my children came along, I read it to them. Now I am taking another trip&#34; over the rainbow&#34; with my grandchildren!<br /><br />This is a story that will live on for ages and I hope that others will enjoy it as much as I have.
B000002GWJ|5.0|No one makes the seedy underworld come alive like Tom Waits. He paints the tragic side of life with a loving and knowing hand.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This has worked very well, letting me know with an audible message whether the battery is getting low or if it is fully charged. And, the visuals are great!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Sofar I am intrigued but can already tell it's going to cost me to continue.  I don't like being forced to spend money.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|The book was quiet small so the movie added a substantial amount, especially at the begging, to embellish the story.  The embellishments don't distract from the story, though.  Some may say it is a &#34;chick flick&#34;, but my husband actually like it, too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!!  Took it on vacation and it was perfect entertainment!  Really great twists and turns, I can't wait for more from Gillian!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This will always rate at the top of my favorites list.  This will be ever a classic.  Visually stunning.  Well worth the long wait for its release.  In 3D it is even more enthralling.  You can live in their world and love it.
0199571791|5.0|This book was a breath of fresh air for me. Albie is funny, irreverent, compassionate and extremely intelligent. This book captures for me the meaning of &#34;the new South Africa&#34; and is an inspiration for anyone who seeks to engage with the law as a tool to protect human rights. So far, South Africa is a model for making social and economic rights justiciable and this book describes the difficulties and triumphs in that process. I will be foisting it on colleagues and friends until they have all read it and been similarly inspired.
B00AH8U3UC|4.0|Hank just gets less, well endearing in this season. The relationship between him and his ex wife, is getting really boring, predictable, annoying and frankly questionable on the validity I am over it already. I say let Hank just be Hank and move the Hell on already...Karen is a boring dysfunctional, sooo not sexy anymore
B0098VYCCE|5.0|A great new version of Snow White. The darkness is the only thing that really turns me off but it is part of the theme so I guess I put up with that part for the great special effects and just a different story then the same old, same old.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some good some not. the games can be free or you can pay to unlock them. some neat games I would never have thought of and some new twists on old games.
0345803485|1.0|I read a few pages and put this book down. Wanna buy it cheap? I will never finish it.<br /><br />I looked forward to a compelling journey but what I got was pure tripe.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|This is a very sensitive microphone that is easy to use, picks up quiet voices, and is yet very light.  It has a body suspended by two bands so the mic floats to avoid sounds from handling and camera lens auto focus movements.  It is far superior to any other mic I have tried.  I rate it very highly.  I was glad I bought it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline which is tyrpical of the Jack Reacher series. Jack Reacher is the sort of larger than life hero of my childhood, and I find his simple brutal interpretation of life's rules to be a great foundation for his role in the stories.<br /><br />Mr. Child is one of a very few writers that keep me coming back for more.
B004NOH9LW|3.0|I liked this, but I am OK with slow moving emotional pieces. My husband fell asleep...I was directed to this film researching the afterlife and I was not disappointed. I liked the take on the topic.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I do love this but sometimes my tablet doesn't respond. The ability to twist it around in 3-D helps you get through the game and wish there were more options because the second part where the cube builds itself doesn't work at all for me. But then I got it for free.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|a great seasoned pilot saves the day whereas no one else could have. He deserves to be elevated to hero, but his inability to not drink gets in the way.  Brought up on charges, his union hires a lawyer who can get him off if he just plays along.  Being as Denzel Washington, who plays the pilot, is clearly in denial of his drinking and drug problem, it actually took him admitting guilt where he didn't have to, goes to jail and only then achieves sobriety.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|That the story was exemplary of so, so many of life's lessons:  The importance of freedom and how it is up to each of us to define and achieve it for ourselves; the power of being at peach within ourselves; how the Universe unfolds in ways that we may never understand but is clearly strategic for some higher power.
B008220D7S|5.0|The only reason I can think that other reviewers didn't think it was funny is because they are not married with kids. Maybe there are certain truths in this movie that i think are simply hilarious but you may not fully get until you are married. My kids are not nearly as old as those in the movie...but already I can relate to a lot of the instances and that is why it is so funny. If you were looking for a pot-smoking-drop-out sequel to \\"Knocked Up\\" then this is definitely not it. It is a different humor and maybe you have to have been at the same point in your life as these two characters for it to be truly hilarious. Yes, it is not pretty at times, the lady of the house complains and the gentleman is clueless...I don't know about anyone else but that can describe me and my husband some days of the year! As for a reviewer saying all the funny bits were in the ads...I don't know what ads he watched but the ones I watched weren't even in the movie!! (for instance Paul Rudd in his underwear while his daughter skypes a boy...that does not actually make the final cut of the film.) I'm not 40 yet, but I thought this film was fantastic!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|It's really difficult to write a review of Cloud Atlas without spoiling something for someone. So I'm just going to say that I enjoyed this novel a lot.<br /><br />The narrative is very special, and mostly I think the story works not because its strength as a story, but because the way in which it is narrated.<br /><br />Reading it was kind of a challenge too: English is not my mother tongue, and despite having read quite a few books in English, Cloud Atlas and its different tones was a little bit difficult at times. The first chapter in particular was a double challenge, because of the 19th century vocabulary and because it was quite boring at first.<br /><br />If you're struggling with the book within the first chapter, just keep on. It gets better.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The characters remain true and deeper this season, I watched the season in a weekend and now can't wait to see season III
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I've had this since it originally came out on tape and I played it so much I wore it out. The new CD is a gem. Great music! A classic!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|A great album from a great artist. With &#34;speak now&#34; are her best albums yet.<br />She nailed it again. .
B005LAII12|4.0|It's a pretty good movie. Not as good as I thought that it would be from what I had heard from other people. Overall it has a couple very funny parts in the movie, and is a movie I would recommend for adults with a sense of humor.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Our son said we should see this movie.  We were not impressed with this movie.  It was very slow.  Would not recommend it.
B00AFG8IBW|5.0|The movie is worth the hassle of the subtitles. The acting is outstanding and the plot is great. Must see.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Osmos is simple enough but incredibly engaging. I always lose track of time when I sit and play it. I would recommend it.
B0031SCV46|5.0|I bought this keyboard along with the M-Audio Studiophile AV40 Powered Monitor Speakers as a wedding present for my friend. He loved both. Success!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed the Kindle edition book and frankly had trouble putting it down.  Also enjoyed the quirkly ending!  I have recommended it to several of my friends.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|I downloaded SpinArt, because it has great reviews, and looked interesting. However, it doesn't seem to work with the Google Nexus 7 that I own.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The movie was good. Just wasn't my kinda of movie. But it shows what they have to go through in there jobs in the military.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Pretty twisted. Always keeps you guessing. I thought it was better than the first season. Can't wait for the next season.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|I thought the movie, The Man with the Iron Fist, was pretty much a throw-back from the old kung-fu movies in the 70's.  The only difference was the film was not totally out-of-sync when the actors' talked.  I liked Russell Crowe and RZA in his directing/acting debut.  All of the actors played their parts well; the spewing of the blood was a bit much but that's what this genre is all about.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I enjoy building computers in my free time and was excited to try this unit out for a low end gaming rig for a relative.  They are a casual gamer and I feel this APU is going to be a great fit.  I tested it with Minecraft (a more CPU intensive game) and Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Multiplayer.  I did have to turn the settings down lower for Black Ops, but at 720p and medium settings the game ran smooth and played well.  While this would not do for my own gaming needs (I am a graphics snob) it will do the average user fine with xbox 360 quality graphics or better.  For anyone building a Home Theater unit or a light gaming rig, I would highly recommend this CPU and GPU combo processor with a MicroATX board (I used the FM2-A55M-E33) and a stick of 4GB DDR3 ram, all for $150 for a compact but capable rig.  I will update my review if I have any problems in the future.  No news is good news.
B0000TAZYW|5.0|I'm an audiophile(CD specialist). I have in excess of 1,000 cd's(est.300 SACD/75 DVD-audio). This DVD-audio disc/Verve label for sound-quality is 10+. The recording engineer should have won a \\"Grammy\\" for his work! I play this disc on a OPPO-BDP-95. Sounds wonderful in a 5.2 audio system![[ASIN:B0000TAZYW Diana Krall: When I Look in Your Eyes]]
0312117337|4.0|I love OSHO. Before I buy the card deck, I would like to know what is on the other side of the card? Some decks nowadays have the meaning of the card on the other side (with expended meaning in the accompanying book).<br />thanks for your help!<br /><br />Follow up- I went to OSHO's site and I think I saw what the back of the cards are but can someone upload a photo?
B0064T6LV8|5.0|It is a fun game to play anytime of the day. I can choose any game I want to play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I always know where my Kindle is.  I can never find my calculator. Great idea great help. Thanks keep up the great work.
B00867GJYK|4.0|My kids begged for me to buy this movie, and they watch it all the time. very good kids movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing! I loved the descriptions of the characters and the setting. It didn't have any gory deaths like I thought it would which was great. The plot was incredible and I can't wait to read the second book.
0375701427|5.0|One of the great novels of our time, the sense of history, time, the family, the focus on details, like stitching gloves for example, the weather underground, the anger, the betrayal . . . don't miss it

B00B99KJR0|5.0|the game is very challenging. like the chance to beat the time. love the story that goes along with the game. great graphic and sound
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this film last spring at a special screening in Houston. I dreaded seeing a subtitled film but the trailer I saw on YouTube was enough to capture my interest. Within the first ten minutes of the movie I honestly forgot I was reading the dialogue!<br />This plot scenario has been done before, but never have I seen it done so well. My favorite movie as long as I can remember has been shawshank redemption but this is threatening to take over that spot<br />If you can read, and don't buy this movie, shame on you!<br />Note: For those not paying attention, the US release is march 5th.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a fun hidden objects game with a few puzzles thrown in. The game plays flawlessly. Some of the dialogue is hilarious.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Unable to get to settings menu on galaxy tab 2. Settings button is not visible so I can not change the storage location or download new maps.  Works fine on older phone withpermanent settings button.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have never read a book by Nicholas Sparks and have always been told that the movies made about his book are so much better than the actual book. I have not seen the movie Safe Haven, but I do feel that what I was told will be true. The book had a good story, but for me it just wasn't great. I felt that the author spent more time focusing on describing what the sky looked like or details about the food that he neglected the emotions of the romance. Its like on minute Alex and Katie were chatting then next they were in love. I just didn't feel the emotional passion between the characters. That being said he did a great job letting the reader see into the head of Kevin and how crazed he really was. So in a nut shell, it was an ok book, not great just ok.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever u should get this game its way better than the outher one!!!!! if i were u i whould get it now and pluse it free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003A9WLCS|5.0|The beat of this song is just so tight! It gets into your entire soul and you just gotta get up and move!
0792844890|5.0|This is one of the most required funny films you have to see because it makes you crack up laughing at every turn.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Who would have thought that one character could last through so many books. Mitch Rapp is stronger than ever. Whether you're a fan or never heard of Rapp, you'll be spellbound.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Typical solid Wes Anderson movie. Odd camera shots, odd plot line, the always present odd boy in love with a manic pixie dream girl. Wes does not disappoint.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Yes this is a movie soundtrack, but it doesn't mean the music is any less enjoyable and is a must have for anyones music library.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Good quality in sound and production. The recording and cast are excellent and I will buy again from same series.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The writer is very thorough and actually cares that you really understand each step, and leaves you with the confidence that you can handle the job on your own!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Okay I'm horrible at titling reviews. But the movie was fantastic. I loved the way the movie was payed out. With brief snips of his past life. It moved the story along. And the relationship of the 2 main characters was so powerful and raw.<br /><br />Okay I really do think that the main characters had an awesome relationship but I have no idea what raw has to do in this context.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Although I like the music, this is not one of her finest.  I prefer a mix of music and these recordings all sound similar.
B005MMY534|2.0|more people liked it than disliked it.<br /><br />Really had a hard time accepting the boy who plays Arthur, seems to me he should have been cast as the farmers pig boy, not as a ledgenday warrior king. I tried very hard to finish watching the series. Well I watched it, it's pretty much crap, but 2 stars for being better than staring at the wall.<br /><br />It was not even close to the anything like the legend, I guess the names were the same, that's the only nice thing I can say.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I FOUND IT TO BE THE TRUE HISTORICAL ASPECT OF OUR HISTORY - ALWAYS ACQUIRING OR TRYING TO ACQUIRE LAND, & OTHER GOODIES FROM THE CONQUERED PEOPLE.  I KNOW WE HAVE OTHER HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT THIS ASPECT OF CONSTANT CONQUEST HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN IN THE HISTORY CLASSES I ATTENDED.<br />MUCH LIKE THE HISTORY WRITTEN BY THE LATE HOWARD ZINN.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Definitely getting back to its roots, no stupid scenes, minimal politically correct BS, no over hyped Hollywood actresses like Halle Berry overly flaunting her \\"assets\\" with that silly short hair....but more to the good old Bond look and feel.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the story line could have been clearer and more interesting and to the point like the original Bond series, and that there were too many massive explosions and millions of rounds shot....in other words FILLER for lack of a good script!!!<br /><br />But overall getting better, and finally we got rid of....you'll find out, and hopefully better movies to come!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it! its like playing Mario bros I have been searching hi &amp; low for a game similar to Mario brothers. This game is a sure winner
B007SGM084|5.0|It is interesting, but sometimes difficult to understand Ana's attraction to Grey in the first book; but as you get to know the characters and the story line plays out, the quick reads give you something to think about in your own relationships. I could not put it down!
B00968Q7DQ|5.0|WOw,BIG BIG TRAIN,ALL I CAN SAY IS,ASIDE FROM THIS,THERE IS NOTHING BETTER,FANTASTIC ALBUM,FOR ME IS ALBUM OF THE YEAR THE MUSIC IS GREAT,THE VOCALS IS WONDERFULL,THIS IS PROG ROCK OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED BY THE OF 70'S STYLE PROG,THIS GUYS ARE SIMPLY BRILLANT MUSICIANS AND GREAT EFFORT BY THE BAND B.B.T
1616615362|5.0|The Slave 1 / Firespray-31 is one of four \\"Wave 2\\" expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game (and 1 of the first 2 large ships released in the game - the other being the Millennium Falcon which I review separately). The MSRP is $30, but you can usually get it for +/- $20 if you shop around or wait for a sale.  All things considered I think this ship is a great, must have addition to the game.  Here's why.<br /><br />First, you get 4 new pilots (including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities).  Unique pilots include:<br /><br />Boba Fett (the baddest bounty hunter in the galaxy), a level 8 pilot, whose special ability reads, \\"When you make a bank maneuver, you may rotate your dial to the other bank maneuver of the same speed.\\" This gives you lots of flexibility to set up or avoid an attack.<br /><br />Kath Scarlet, a level 7 pilot whose special ability reads, \\"When attacking, the defender receives 1 stress token if he cancels at least 1 critical hit.\\"<br /><br />\\"Krassis Trelix\\", a level 5 pilot whose special ability reads, \\"When attacking with a secondary weapon, you may reroll 1 attack die\\".<br /><br />It also includes a generic \\"Bounty Hunter\\" pilot with no special ability so you can use more than one of this ship in a game if you'd like.<br /><br />Second, it also includes MANY upgrade cards (most of which are exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released): Homing Missiles, Assault Missiles, Ion Cannon (with a 90 degree firing arch , which is different from the Y-Wing Ion Cannon Turret which has a 360 firing arch), Heavy Laser Cannon, Veteran Instincts (increases your pilot skill by 2), Expose, Seismic Charges and Proximity Mines (both are bombs you can release as part of your move and they each work in different ways), Gunner, Mercenary Copilot, 2 Stealth Device (a 3 point upgrade that lets you increase your agility by 1 until you are hit the first time), and Slave 1 (even though it is called Slave 1 on the box, the expansion is really for the generic Firespray-31... this upgrade cards lets you actually call it the unique Slave 1 and gives you a minor special ability if you do). It should be noted that some of the upgrades can only be used on this ship, while others can be used on any ship for either side.<br /><br />Finally, it has two firing arch (a 90 degree firing arch in front, and a 90 degree firing arch in back).  You can fire your primary weapon using either firing arch, but you have to fire secondary weapons from the front firing arch).  One drawback is that the base is so big it's hard to maneuver (that is, to avoid asteroids and other ships so you don't lose your ability to attack or take actions that turn).<br /><br />The expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).<br /><br />Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side, I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game.s really for the generic Firespray-31... this upgrade cards lets you actually call it the unique Slave 1 and gives you a minor special ability if you do).

159514188X|3.0|This book sends a good message. To say I haven't carried anything away from this book would be a lie, but it's not a book I would recommend.  It does teach you the value of caring for another, but it was hard to keep up with the book at times.  Flipping between her tapes and Clay talking sometimes got to be too much.  The way this book is written doesn't keep the reader wanting to read much more... at least not this reader.  And to be honest, her final words... not that powerful. I expected a lot more creaitivity within the end. That's what this book lacked.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I loved the movie, I saw it in the cinema first and decided to re watch it with a friend. The playback quality was flawless and well worth the 5 bucks to enjoy it. Nothing bad to report here.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This is the worst app I have ever bought on my Kindle! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! The only reason I got the game in the first place is because I got rewards on Bakery Story. Bakery Story is the best game EVER!!! I can't believe that Dragon Story and Bakery Story are created by the same company.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I got this app for the timer. However. Volume does not work on my Kindle Fire HD<br /><br />update... just put this on my phone and works great on it.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|The theme of this movie is for real. It is action packed towards the end. What I do not understand is how Alan Arkin can be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and just what was John Goodman suppose to do. It is a decent movie,.
B000XWJQF0|2.0|Bought this movie for the kids and could not believe how poor the picture quality was. Renting was available in two formats; HD and SD. The only option for purchasing was SD. I have seen VHS tapes with better quality video. Did I mention the video quality was bad?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love this game.  It is challenging, and very entertaining at the same time.  Kids learned it instinctively, yet they found new and exciting things.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|These days it is difficult to find new good hard rock music. But you know anything Corey Taylor is involved in is going to be the best of the best. This does not disappoint. It is hard driving, thoughtful and the best thing you will hear all year. Until part 2 is released!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a well done, fun, suspenseful movie ... I never thought too much of him before but I have a whole new opinion of Ben Affleck .. would have been so easy to overplay the role of Tony Mendez ....Great movie, you should watch it.
B00061S0QE|1.0|The dvd is region 2, it will not play on any of my systems. United States is region 1. I have never heard of dvd's having regions.
B00913SKMW|1.0|This dvd is without a doubt one of the worst I have ever seen. It is gross, dumb and a waste of all involved. I highly suggest that no one purchase this item. There are several adjectives to describe this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! Very well writte. page. A page turner for sure! Highly recommend! Waiting for book four.
1592400876|3.0|I bought it for myself but gave it to a professional editor who works for me.  I didn't have the patience to read through the text.  He found it entertaining but I found the narration too detailed and analytical and the examples too few.  Ok for the right audience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is as much of a page turner as any book I've read. Complex characters and situations. Hard to put down.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just when you think alls OK it bites...........then it destroys your whole plan that you had a couple time over, but its winnable. Something to do on a rainy day.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I hadn't heard anything about this film until my brother recommended I watch it. I had my doubts but he said it was really good and boy was it! I've had this movie for only a week and have watched it in it's entirety 3 times! Not counting all the times when my son and I would just watch the song parts. It is really REALLY good! Very entertaining and just totally and thoroughly enjoyable! You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Side note: The movie has also prompted me to listen to songs that I am not very familiar with and I've actually purchased some because of this movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun, easy to learn.  colors are good . cards are easy to read.  would reccommend to my friends and family
B003MC5N28|4.0|Interesting story line.  I found this on a recommendation list for The Hunger Games books.  Not as good as those stories, but it does have a really good and unique story line.

It was spectacular to see some of the pages of the book come to life in beautiful flowers in the parade.<br />This also would make a great gift for a high school graduate.

Tired every possible way of putting the picture together & nothing works to complete it and continue with the game, I'm stuck there and it's pretty much the end of this game. I would like advice so that I can move on.

When I first started to casually watch baseball with my husband in 2007, I decided to read this book after I heard a sportscaster refer to it during a broadcast.  This book turned me from a casual baseball fan into a fanatic.  It explained so much about the game and was so well written I couldn't put it down.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|Don Tillman is a brilliantly smart man who works at a Melbourne University. He's pretty much only got two friends, Gene and Claudia who are married to each other and both psychologists. They are in an open marriage where Gene has a goal to sleep with a woman from every country on Earth. Don doesn't see anything wrong with this, as he sees the world without the hindrance of requirements to follow social protocol influencing how everyone should behave. Therefore he doesn't believe in marriage, but feels he still would like to find a life partner, he's prepared to get married if that's what his life partner wants, he's flexible on that. However he's certainly not flexible on a lot of other things, as he knows that if he is, the relationship will eventually fail, and Don does everything as efficiently as possible. So he has come up with a scientific questionnaire to be taken by his would be life partners. He has dubbed this endeavour, the Wife Project and is constantly tweaking it after something goes wrong in each date, such as woman believing there is a difference between apricot and peach ice cream. He also has a side project going after he mistakenly believed an attractive woman who visited his office was sent by Gene as a successful applicant for his Wife Project. He can't believe why Gene sent his worst match ever but before he found this out she had asked him as professor of genetics to help her find out who her real father is, the candidates being her now deceased mother's school class. This father project is an interesting challenge for Don to do while his Wife project struggles to find candidates.<br /><br />Don looks at the world differently to your regular guy. He follows routines, doing things at set times of day, eating specific meals on certain days of the week, chooses the least impact on the environment mode of transport and dresses for the purpose or the conditions while totally ignoring fashion. In fact there's an hilarious piece of dialogue between him and the restaurant greeter about how his expensive hiking type jacket coat is much superior to the type of coat to what they want him to wear under their dress code. He tells us throughout the novel he has misdiagnosed with a number of medical labels, such as Aspergers, Autism, Bipolar and schizophrenia that he knows through his own research are the wrong diagnosis.  We in fact never find out why Don is like he is, probably because to him ultimately it doesn't matter. This probably is also a good idea so potential readers who themselves or family members with any of the aforementioned conditions won't be offended by anything Don does and send angry letters to the author.  Don just understands his brain works differently to everyone else. The best way to describe Don would be like the character Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, less the superiority to everyone else on the planet complex. He also shows no interest in Star Trek and those sorts of stereotypical nerdy things, in fact he is a master of Aikido and other martial arts, rock climbing and other skills he saw as vital to exceeding in life and that he uses at some stage in this novel, much to our reading enjoyment.<br /><br />I actually read the paperback version but Amazon doesn't seem to allow reviews of it at the moment so I've had to put this under the Kindle version. Kindle book might possibly have this as well but on the back cover of the physical book there is Rosie Project website where you can take a similar exam to his Wife Project one in the book to see if you're compatible with Don.<br /><br />The Rosie Project is a situation comedy type book. It is hard to categorise what genre it is, definitely isn't a romance novel, or chick lit. You could call it a mystery as Don has to work out who Rosie's father is.  I guess similar authors would be Mike Gayle, Jonathan Tropper, John O'Farrell, but really the The Rosie Project is pretty unique, there's not much point trying to categorise it.im and the restaurant greeter about how his expensive hiking type jacket coat is much superior to the type of coat to what they want him to wear under their dress code.

0385341008|5.0|I was looking for a book based around World War II, giving an idea of the way people lived through the fear, stress and hunger of the time. This novel written in the easy-to-read style of letters certainly did that.<br />The British government refused to defend the Channel Islands when Hitler occupied them; they only evacuated the children. With the occupiers taking their lions share of availble food, and no organized Channel Islands' resistance movement, there was scope for much passive resistance.<br />The book tells of one particular Guernsey inhabitant - Elizabeth - who falls in love with one of the enemy. She and her baby are shielded by members of a book group, who become the baby's family. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society fulfills many other functions: it helps to feed its members - sometimes with an undeclared pig or precious vegetables; it provides education and friendship, even though some members have only one book to discuss; and it is a form of passive resistance as it defies the German-enforced curfews!<br />I found this book unexpectedly. Its title certainly hid a gem. Its style was lovely - light and easy, even with the end to Elizabeth's story. For those who enjoy romance there is also the overarching fictional story of a more recent love affair.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I am not the kinda guy to watch musicals, I prefer action shooters but I decided to give this movie a chance since it had some great actors such as Hugh Jackman in it. I love this show more than I thought I would. This movie was beautifully made, of course the story would have been changed up a bit to the actual book but I believe it covered as much as it possibly could. Very talented actors, I don't reallly like Russel Crowe except for in one previous movie where he helped his innocent wife escape prison. Bloody great talent these actors have, great music and amazing concepts behind each scene. This movie is quality top class for all ages! The story of survival, morality, love and the human spirit's will is deeply portrayed to an amazing extent. I am 18 by the way. I heard some people arguing this show is only for Christians. But they are wrong, it doesn't matter what religion whether your a christian, muslim, hindu, buddhist or atheist. All of the covered topics relate to everyone. I would definitely buy the dvd.<br /><br />Find me on Flickr<br /><br />~Go to Flickr<br />~Then type in a \\"/\\" then \\"photos\\" then \\"/\\" and last type in \\"suipeter\\"<br />And that should take you there.

B0031RSA24|4.0|I've read Krauss's A universe from nothing and it explains beautifully the reasoning behind our universe's probable past, present and the future. And I also highly recommend reading 'Nine lives' by William Dalrymple before reading this. It gives some unique perspectives on religious theories.<br /><br />For most of the reasons discussed in The god delusion, even before reading it, I came to the very same conclusions by myself.<br />That there was no evidence of a creator and no 'supernatural' phenomenon that couldn't be explained, I'd already accepted these as 'facts' long back.<br /><br />I consider myself a closet atheist. Although, I still considered religious faith to be good for believers.<br />I also respected others' right to their own religious beliefs. (Read:Silently listen to one's supernatural mumbo-jumbo without questioning or showing any discernible disagreement.)<br /><br />What this book does is gives a very compelling argument against a closet atheist's usual decorum, i.e. silently nod away at the fairy-tales.<br />Hell, I even chuckled at the mention of the \\"I'm an atheist, BUT...\\" category, in the preface. That was eerily true for my own belief.<br />Before reading this, I didn't know how misconstrued the idea of an 'atheist' was for the society.<br /><br />So,<br />1. If you're a non-believer(atheist), but think, blind faith helps the society in anyway, read this. He does have some very compelling arguments.<br /><br />2. If you're a believer(creationist), I don't think you're gonna buy this one, so only lash out once you've fully read it.<br />Corollary: If you wan't to lash out on this one, please buy one and read it completely.<br /><br />My only critique is that I think the writing could be a little simpler.<br />All in all, this is one ballsy book and I highly regard this effort as a step in the right direction for reshaping our society, probably even more than Darwin's own, origin of species!

B003QSJVV2|3.0|We saw this movie a few years ago and knew that we would like it.  Our only complaint is in regards to the playback of this particular Amazon rental.  It stopped once in the middle of the movie, which was not really a big deal because it resumed within a few seconds, but then, it stopped SIX TIMES within the LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES of the movie.  Not too happy about that, as most of the action in this movie takes place at the end.  Out of the last six interruptions, we received two error messages, indicating that we needed to choose another movie.  Very frustrating!!!  Not too pleased with our first rental experience from Amazon.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Who ever HBO gets to design their Season Box set of this show is awesome. Like the previous set of Season 1 we get the episode guide/Disc Menu guide and all the content on one side with a giant map of Westeros on the other that was taken from the books only with color and full size map and not 2-3 pages of different maps. So kuddos.<br /><br />The next improvement is with the menus themselves on the discs. Season 1 you go to the extras or the episode menu and it would show the full season list of the show for each episode but obviously you can't access all these episodes on a single disc, even on a Blu Ray disc. Same with extras. What I didn't like from before was never any real clue as to what specific disc held what extras. I had to drag out the menu guide and look at each disc to see which ones had commentary, what extras were on what.<br /><br />Now, you go into the menu and each extra is given a disc number to tell us the viewer where that specific extra is. Love it when it makes navigation more easy to understand. I'm not saying I'm too lazy to do all that, if push comes to shove I'll do all that to see what is where, but it's nice when the people making the menus put in these nice little touches.<br /><br />Now I haven't watched all the episodes yet, I'm only about half way to 3/4 of the way through but so far the show is still just as fantastic as when I saw it air on TV.<br /><br />I also am happily surprised at the large number of commentary tracks added on compared to Season 1. There are even multiple tracks for some episodes. One is director/writer/crew commentary (mostly David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) and the other is the cast commentary. And of course George R.R. Martin himself gets his own commentary track for Blackwater, the episode he wrote himself. Which is another reason why I love this show over other book adapted TV shows or even films is this show actually allowed the author himself to contribute in some meaningful way to the show. He doesn't have complete authority over the show but the show creators respect his input. And again, he got it in his contract to be allowed to write an episode per season.<br /><br />Once again too, Peter Dinklage steals the show again with Maisie Williams a close second for actors who really know how to play these characters to the sheer limit.<br /><br />Now I got to wait for Season 3 to come out. I'm not gonna say what will happen (I've read and own the books) but I've a feeling its gonna be even bigger and more awesome then before and this show has gotten pretty big and awesome already.ave complete authority over the show but the show creators respect his input.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I agree with all the reviews that have already been written, the first three books of this series, grabbed me and yanked me away from reality and wouldn't let up.  I was warned by the bad reviews for the last two books, but I knew I wouldn't be able to resist temptation and read them and I have been wading through them over the last couple of weeks.  Really terrible.  I have never been this frustrated with an author in my life, and I am an avid reader.<br /><br />The fourth book I think is really where you hit rock bottom, although this book isn't too much better.  I have literally skipped pages of this book only to find two characters hashing out the same thing five pages later.  We really don't need this much dialogue at all.  Someone else did a clever review on this book where they counted the number of times the author used his repetitive phrases that he seems to love so much, and it is true.  \\"Words are wind\\", \\"A Lannister always pays his debts\\" and the one that makes me shudder the most, and my least favorite character and situation, Jon Snow and the Wall with his \\"You know nothing\\" schtick.  Every time I see a chapter starting out there I just siigh and start skipping paragraphs.  But the thing that frustrated me the most about this book is when a character and storyline would actually draw me in for a minute and then, BOOM, you're changing points of view for the 50,000th time to a storyline you can barely remember.<br /><br />I can't save you, only you can save yourself, but maybe you are like me and you just wanted to catch a glimpse of the characters that intrigued you about this series, but it is an exercise in anguish.  It is really sad how far these two books fall down from what seems to be author ego or hubris or indulgence, I don't know, from the first three engaging, exciting books of the series.  Trim down the POVs, give us the characters we love and stop dragging it out.<br /><br />It almost seems like the author doesn't want to pull the trigger on the major plot points.  For instance, he takes what could  have been the most fascinating things about these books, the mothertrucking dragons and chains them up for like 800 pages of book.<br /><br />And if Tyrion Lannister scratches his scar one more time......arghhh, I really hate what he did with this character, who was one of my faves at one point in time.  I just have no words.  My hope is that the Game Of Thrones series on HBO will force them to take these muddled sprawling plots and condense them into something great.the major plot points.

Like this.<br /><br />It's the mark of a truly great band when you can have lengthy debates over which of their albums are the greatest, and Smashing Pumpkins are no exception to that. The first three records released from Billy Corgan et al are all worthwhile contenders of (grand voice) Their Greatest Album, but it this, their third, that I consider to be their untouchable masterpiece. The first two albums, Gish and Siamese Dream are, well, just that. Albums. Great albums, granted, but Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness is much, much more than that.<br /><br />Double disc albums can be tricky to pull off successfully, and is often the result of an over-inflated ego and ambition over talent, with pointless filler tracks and the odd hit single buried in alongside the clutter. A handful of artists not only managed to escape that trap but also released some of their greatest works. The Beatles, Prince and the Stones all created genuinely great doubles, while other bands like Red Hot Chilli Pepper's (2006's Stadium Arcadium) drowned under it's own weight. That the Smashing Pumpkins managed to create 28 (TWENTY EIGHT!) songs of undeniable quality on the one record is quite the astonishing feat; but these guys were knocking out great songs with seemingly every breath around this time. You only have to hear the B-sides from Mellon Collie's(amazing) singles; the lovely strum of \\"Meladori Magpie\\", which most bands would kill to have as a lead single, the sinister growl of \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\", and let's not forget the truly stunning seven track \\"Zero\\" EP, with songs better than most bands best works, to see that this is a band at their true creative peak.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the songs on the album itself. The Pumpkins took full advantage of the double album format and created a rock record with tremendous depth and diversity. The lush, orchestral \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", the ragtime whimsy of \\"Lily\\" and the sheer feral rage of \\"X.Y.U\\" just should not WORK on the same album.. but the Pumpkins somehow pull it off. The nagging bassline of \\"1979\\" drips into your skin after a few listens, \\"Thirty Three\\" will break your heart with every listen, \\"Jelly Belly\\" is the sound of buildings falling on dynamite and \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\" is the future soundtrack to an awesome vampire movie . And you know, this would be the tracklist on most great single albums, but it barely scratches the surface on Mellon Collie. \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" is a hard rock, Grammy winning gem, \\"By Starlight\\" is a sparse and gorgeous ballad and \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" will either have you hiding under the bed or trashing your room with a baseball bat. Just... Too. Much. Brilliance.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this isn't just a \\"Billy Corgan and some guys in the background playing the instruments\\" album. This is the sound of a BAND at work, with James Iha (who's solo work is sadly under-rated) and D'arcy Wretzky contributing more to the record than ever before (or since, for that matter). Iha's self-penned songs close both discs, \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" are both simple, sleepy love songs that compliment what has come before. Beauty, innocence, love, anger, loneliness and rage, all together on one essential record.<br /><br />Ah, the dreaded \\"E\\" bomb. The word \\"essential\\" gets banded about a lot when it comes to music, and I imagine there are a lot of \\"essential\\" albums gathering dust on peoples shelves right now, but Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness is, in every sense, an essential album in any rock fan's collection. Endlessly inventive, as tender as it is brutal and as accessible and listenable as it is murky and challenging, it is more than a collection of great songs. It's the sound of a band reaching for the sky and soaring past the stars.<br /><br />Sigh. And that's it for part three. Only two more slices of loveliness before I have to go down the long and winding road of despair and one star reviews that I normally travel. Join me next time while I actually enjoy myself, won't you?y rock fan's collection.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|Exceptionally poorly written. I thought at first I had mistakenly ordered a children 's story but the sexual references and innuendos dispelled that idea. The characters are from cardboard and unbelievably simplistic. The geography of the imagined world makes no sense: a chasm that is supposed to be circular but there is a mountain range dividing two warring clans. What happened to the chasm? I did not bother to finish the book .
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The art work on the box and on the book is excellent and the entire thing is very sturdy. There is a large amount of bonus material as well as all six movies. Well worth the money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the first season and couldn't find the second season anywhere. So I had to purchase it and I was so glad I did. It's a great series that captivates you with it's simplicity, costumes, setting.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever!!!Go subsurfers!:)I love Lily she is awesome!jazz hands!I love you so much!!!!!:):):):):):):):):):)!!!!!<br />LOL laugh out loud
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Bought this to build an ESXi 5 server and it worked well.  Loaded it up with 32gb of ram and ended up buying another for my VM environment.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Amazing movie, great plot and excellent characters. Just another wonderful Tarantino production with plenty of gore and excellent fight scenes.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|One of the best fantasy novels I have read in recent years. Excellent plot, well developed characters and a finely spun mystery. I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I await the next Pendergast book every year with great anticipation.  This one did not disappoint.  The introduction and development of the new characters is always exceptional.  The subplots that are weaved in and reappear in every book create the illusion that you are following the lives of people you come to know as family.  No matter how far fetchet the plot Lincoln an Child manage to keep you hooked.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My cable carrier didn't pick it up for season three so I had to purchase online and was happy it was available.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I enjoyed the historical time references and the people and how they acted towards each other - servants and priviledged - very interesting.<br />Moving on into war and then out - changes were good.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I, like most fans am just happy to have something new sung by the great and powerful Mrs. Cannon. As is typical of most Stargate production, the song is a nice mid-tempo with some percussion to catch the ears. Aside from the over-mechanization of her voice in parts of the song, you can still hear her using her pipes. All in all, it's pretty good song and I hope that vocal wise, it's indicative of her future release.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun. i would like more horse options but it still is pretty fun to play. not a bad way to spend time
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat with this book. Great story, I'd totally recommend the book to friends and family. In fact I'm going to loan it to a family member tonight. I'm also looking forward to seeing the movie.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I know that I'm usually not one that watches these kind of movies, but I know that sometimes you gotta feel that you must watch something funny/romantic.  I was hesitant at first to watch it, because I only figured that the trailer was only showing the good parts of the movie itself.  So I decided to rent it, and I was astonished.  It's a really good (feel good/romantic/comedy) movie.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This was a hard game to find and was sold out every where but online. Once again you came through for me and on time. This is a great game. It is not easy but lot of fun.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I gotta say this is not my typical book i would read, but I am so glad I did.  I couldnt put it down from beginning to end. it was a really stormy day and was a great day for reading.  The book made me feel like i was really in it and was fighting the zombie apocalypse.  haha!  All i can say is buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I can't believe all the people that love this book...frankly, I hated it.  Anyone who has actually suffered abuse or known someone who has would know after three pages that this is about sexual abuse.  I found the twists and turns pathetic...I'll leave it at that.  If you like depressing, sad books about an extremely sensitive subject matter than this is the book for you.
030759565X|5.0|I bought it as a Christmas present for my friend. She loves it. My sister has one and we have been enjoying all of the  yummy recipes she has tried from it so far. The book layout is pretty sweet and the humor scattered through makes cooking more than fun. Great cookbook!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game keeps me company and I love horses and taking care of them so this is a terrific game!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love the show. Love having instant streaming access. Only problem was that the HD stream got fuzzy for a bit at mid-episode. It self-corrected, but not without a noticeable interruption.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This was on his wish list of new music for Christmas. He claims that it is a great gift. Thanks
B00112ASYO|5.0|Bought this for my 5 years old grandson. It is very durable and made so real looking. He loves playing crocodiles.

1607148633|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book; could hardly put it down. It arrived in good time and was as described. I foundtbold print vocabulary words to be very helpful. Would definitely recommend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|One of the best shows on tv, i love owning all the seasons to watch over n over, great for any fan
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Very pleased, action packed, and good story!  Extremely happy I bought this movie! Hope they make more.  Recommend it for anyone.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|Took a looong time to reach my door, considering I live in a city.  And there isn't even a tracking number!<br /><br />Whatsoever, this product is perfect for my needs.  I use two 32gb micro SD cards.  Now I have 59gb of usable memory on my PSP.<br />Thats awesome.  Pretty cheap considering that the a 32gb MSduo card costs $98 at Gamestop.

1400067820|5.0|This book is an eye opener in its entirety. Almost every page will enlighten you about aspects of  everything around you. Its an exciting read through and through with some very sharp , insulting in the face examples and name calling and occasional caustic 'Fat Tony' humor . I was so impressed with the ideas of this book, i read the entire bibliography section and picked out my next set of books to read.<br /><br />The central theme is the thesis of what NNT has spend his life researching and trust me he manages to keep it simple, so much so I can summarize the book in one line.<br /><br />*You don't need know how x behaves, as long as you can control f(x) where f(x) is your exposure to x.*<br /><br />my contrived example here...<br />====<br />X = depth of river<br />Average(x)= 4 ft<br />Past observed Max(x) = 6 ft [ predictors go on to say safe for humans taller than 6ft based on past experience ]-- this is the suckers trap, turkey problem, fragilista... whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />However Max(x) is really not knowable , i.e. absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, the unintelligible is not unintelligent, also called the black swan, fat tail, ...unknown unknowns whatever you want to call it..<br /><br />Now because we don't know Max(x), f(x) could be one of [get wet, near drowning, drowning, death,...]<br /><br />with life jacket though even with unknown Max(x) , f(x) is limited to get wet.<br />=====<br /><br />A more real example here ...<br /><br />I most recently applied this to Winter storm Nemo (as i was reading the book). I don't need to know or predict how extreme Nemo would be( as long as i had a torch, water, gas stove, gas room heater, enough food, gas and cash ). See its that simple, we control the exposure , not the storm.( and such wisdom has been with us humans for ever, until modern day attempts to predict everything ). This example is just one of being Robust and not anti-fragile, an anti-fragile example would be if bought insurance before hurricane Sandy for 10 times the worth of my house say on the NJ beach, i would infact start hoping that the hurricane destroy my house (i.e. i have upside (convex) f(x) with the volalitility of x, and i want x to be volatile in that scenario )<br /><br />The same principal applied can answer some though provoking questions (you will find answers in the book )<br /><br />* Why our ancestors are way smarter than we ( moderns ) think they are .<br />* Why ancestral heuristics though sometimes opaque are still the correct approach to a complex ( nonlinear) world (rather than logicians failing to analyze it and hence discard the heuristic ).<br />* Why disinfecting with Lysol actually hurts your child more than letting him play with some dirt instead.<br />* Why the table and chair have lasted for 5000 years and probably will for another 5000, but your smartphone and e-reader wont...<br />* Why the wheels on your suitcase may be one of the important inventions of the 20th century.<br />* Why and how mother nature makes the best decisions without actually understanding the variables( as opposed to doctors/ professors/ forecasters who attempt to predict x .. , not control f(x), and by the very nature of fat tails always get the predictions of x wrong !... ).<br />* Why you cannot trust predictors( charlatans! ) who have no \\"skin in the game\\". They predict you loose , they keep the upside , you cover the downside. If someone in 2007 said Fannie Mae is stable  force them to buy Fannie Mae stock, so they have tonnes to loose if Fannie Mae goes bust .<br /><br />and several such other examples.<br /><br />I am not getting into every detail here, but to end this highly recommended, Like a 21st century bible...will help you going forward in every aspect of existence.surance before hurricane Sandy for 10 times the worth of my house say on the NJ beach, i would infact start hoping that the hurricane destroy my house (i.e. i have upside (convex) f(x) with the volalitility of x, and i want x to be volatile in that scenario )<br /><br />The same principal applied can answer some though provoking questions (you will find answers in the book )<br /><br />* Why our ancestors are way smarter than we ( moderns ) think they are .<br />* Why ancestral heuristics though sometimes opaque are still the correct approach to a complex ( nonlinear) world (rather than logicians failing to analyze it and hence discard the heuristic ).<br />* Why disinfecting with Lysol actually hurts your child more than letting him play with some dirt instead.<br />* Why the table and chair have lasted for 5000 years and probably will for another 5000, but your smartphone and e-reader wont...<br />* Why the wheels on your suitcase may be one of the important inventions of the 20th century.<br />* Why and how mother nature makes the best decisions without actually understanding the variables( as opposed to doctors/ professors/ forecasters who attempt to predict x .. , not control f(x), and by the very nature of fat tails always get the predictions of x wrong !... ).<br />* Why you cannot trust predictors( charlatans! ) who have no \\"skin in the game\\".

B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno has a big sound with instrumentation backing. He can also hold your attention with his voice alone. Enjoy music from someone who loves a good sound without the fear of wandering into another genre. Nice album with variety and energy on every track.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is worth the time to download! It has great graphics to it! You really get to interact  with your horse!  Also, you get to train your horse, play with it, play fun mini games to boost it 's happiness, and go to competitions to earn money and xp for the next level! If you love horses, just like me,  then you 'll love this  game!

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Those darn piggies keep smiling at me when I don't kill them off!  It wouldn't be so aggravating without the smiles...
B0027Z837S|4.0|loved it first time, I liked it this time. guess it has kind of grown old over the years..like me
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case is well made and also doesnt bulk up for Kindle. Great purchase. Mine was more of a bright pink then the picture showed tho.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I chose this processor for my grandfather, and although it far exceeds his requirements, it's still a great processor.  It handles everything I throw at it with ease, and doesn't ever have any hiccups.  It plays videos, games (moderately, not too great), and handles all the tabs, pictures, music, and anything else you can think of without any problems at all.  It runs great, and I couldn't be happier.  Great APU.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Seems to work okay, but  It's hard to sign into and out of it. It also wanted me to enable location tracking and I didn't want to do that.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Excellent characters, story and writing. Loved the different narration style. Story is funny and main character actually has to work for his accomplishments...it's this struggle that makes the novel one of the top fantasy novels out there.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|No other explanation needed. I've also enjoyed The Twilight Trilogy, Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, The Hunger Games Trilogy and now this The Millennium Trilogy.  I know, all very different.  I have no idea where to go next!  ? ? ?

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very exciting and sweet book.  It was scarier than the average Nicholas Sparks novel. I cannot wait to see the movie!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I chose this rating because I REALLY LIKE Jeff Kinney. I like this book because they are fun to read. I will show ALL of my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My boys and I love this game.  It has goals to shoot for and rewards them in a fun way.  It also limits play so they aren`t sitting and playing all day.  Great non-violent game for kids!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a fun read. If I was stranded on Mars this is what i would aspire to. Weir has just enough hard science to make me happy and more than enough humor. Buy this book.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Lots of characters between seasons one and two but they still make it work very well so you're not overwhelmed
1591841666|5.0|If you like motivational books, this is great for you. My President of my company recommended me read this book and I am glad he did. It will motivate you and put you in a different mind set on how to organize you time and efforts. Excellent read.

B009LXECF6|5.0|this album is the best... I love everything he does  alot of his best on this  way to go Bruno Mars xoxo
0525952926|5.0|Good, thorough, story that was a pleasure to read. Can't wait for the next one in the trilogy. Enjoyed reading it over several days.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|There were marked similarities between &#34;Contraband&#34; and another movie starring Mark Wahlberg, &#34;Shooter.&#34; Of the two, the latter was much better. However, if you can get past the rather violent aspects of the film, it's worth a viewing.
030758836X|5.0|My reading tastes are eclectic:  I slogged through &#34;War and Peace&#34; last year and loved all three  volumes of &#34;50 Shades of Gray&#34; but this book is my favorite.  The characters are flawed but genuine. I did not foresee the twists of the plot. I loved it!  The convention of carrying the story via two narratives was compelling. I hated the ending and was cheering for Nick, but it could not have collapsed into a &#34;happily ever after&#34; tale. It's a must-read.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Overall this app is brilliant. The interface is beautiful and intuitive, the sounds are high quality. That being said, I agree that many of the recordings are obvious loops, which I find more distracting than relaxing. There are, however, many sounds to choose from and many more on the web. The &quot;Download More Sounds&quot; button takes you to their web site where more sounds, even user recorded, are available for FREE download. I find this more that makes up for my dislike of a few of the sounds.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very suspenseful and a great read. So far I think better then gone girl. Can't wait to read her next book.<br /><br />.
1442346949|1.0|Hello, I thought that I ordered the book but I got the CD version, I did not know how to return it. I would rather have the book, what can I do?
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This CD contains some of the most entertaining and enlightening music that I have ever heard.  I saw the documentary on cable and just had to order the CD.  Everyone needs to hear this lost music of a generation.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|Once I watched the first season on Netflix, I was excited to purchase and view the first season again after seeing that I could see the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; which means...nothing. It's exactly the same thing unless there is something I'm not understanding about the DVDs. I can't imagine what that is. Anyway, I'm pretty upset, especially since the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; is exactly the same thing as what was on Netflix. After reading the DVD packaging, I'm assuming the Original UK version means it has added &#34;special features&#34;? I would like to know what the &#34;Original UK Version&#34; means. I'm not kidding. I really want to know.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much, it has the same feel as tge show which I enjoy immensely. Can't wait to read tge rest of them.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I can txt anyone i want!!! Thats how much u will love it!! Me and my crush always stay in touch. Its great for the people that dont like to talk face to face
B005NJU8PA|2.0|The author is a good writer that can keep you entertained for a while, but in the end the book seems to be overcrowded with what seem to be sales commission pitches and the recipes are not so good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because I luv buying people and Hoover borads .I also love the world tour that is here . I wonder what the next stop will be? I hope the people that get this app will love it as much as I do. Also to the creaters of this app can you make it just a little bit more challenging.<br />It is to easy for me and I am 10. Not to challenging because there are little kids playing the app and if it is to hard then there not going to play.  Thank you
B0018PJEYY|5.0|When I was a child we were laying on the cabin roof watching the stars, the sound of this album surrounding us.....<br />I haven't heard it for over 40 years (except for &#34;Question&#34; which every classic rock station stills plays 10X per week).<br />Wow, what a fine piece of music.<br />From the first line of the album to the last: &#34;Why do we never get an answer...and then he was answered&#34;, you can't stop listening. He learns compassion and the meaning of life; 60's psychedelia at its best.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Loved it came in record time!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read so many reviews that complained about the grammar of this book which prevented me from purchasing it....then in a moment of weakness I decided why not? It can't be that bad. Truly it wasn't. If your are so worried about the grammar then you are missing the eroticism of the book. I enjoyed it and I'm now on the second and soon to be the third. Enjoy it for what it is....hot steamy sex!
B009ZABU7S|1.0|I would not download this app. It only offers Spanish language setting Dutch language setting Chinese and turkish. I could not understand a thing!!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|I work a great deal with paracord for many projects. There are plenty of &#34;free&#34; sources for knots that have been handed down for generations. Fusion Ties has variations that, once learned, can become a foundation for other ties as well. It builds on skills nicely and can easily be adopted for things like dog collars, belts and the like. Easy to follow for the beginner. Challanging for those in the know.<br /><br />If you work a lot with paracord, you'll appreciate this book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It really makes you think!!!!  I def recommend this book to anyone over 12.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Thank You!  I got the music immediately in my smart phone.  The product will be recommended to friends and family.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Denzel Washington's performance is one for the ages. This is one of Washington's most complex characters. He really takes this character to a new level. Flight is about an addict who is also a pilot. He has mastered the craft of appearing normal while still highly intoxicated. He resembles so many people who suffer with addictions and are able to function in a normal capacity. I was irritated with him during the movie because of his inability to drop the habit. That's a true testament to how hard it is for addicts to come clean. Great movie! Not recommended for kids.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not very well written, but mildly entertaining.  I read the series when I was sick and didn't have anything else to do.  The author tried to give the story some suspense, but it was pretty predictable.  There were so many sex scenes that I became desensitized to them by the end of the first book.  As with most porn (I am using this term loosely) it isn't realistic...the &#34;heroine&#34; has fantastically awesome orgasms every time almost immediately.  The &#34;hero&#34; has another erection almost immediately after his orgasm.  The books are written in first-person from the heroine's standpoint, but I found the most interesting part to be the epilogue (end of book 3), where the author tells a bit of the story from the hero's standpoint (Tom Wolfe and Aldous Huxley do this very well).  I had to see what the hype was about, but wouldn't really recommend this book.
B00B6DTWM2|2.0|I saw this movie had a decent rating on imdb and amazon so rented via amazon hoping it would scare, but I found myself more or less irritated by all the cliches.  I don't like being pandered to, and that's what this heavy-handed Hollywood by-the-numbers horror tale does.  (Some spoilers follow.)<br /><br />There's the scary-face-paint supernatural villain.  (Do supernatural villians really need to doll themselves up to be scary?) The creepy children.  Who, might I add, turn their heads sideways in the Hollywood-approved scary-child-is-scary fashion.  The parent who actually sees something that would send REAL parents on a one way trip outta the house with kids in their arms, yet decides to stay.  My favorite for this particular movie -- the adult who has been experiencing strange phenomena in his new house yet constantly blunders around the house in total darkness.  Flip the light switch on, you goober!  And of course there's lots of herky-jerky motion because we all know how terrifying THAT is.  (Oh brother.)<br /><br />You can feel all the parts being put into place in this obvious Hollywood product. You can actually hear them falling into position -- thunk, thunk, thunk.  Ending obvious?  Very.<br /><br />One issue with this expensive production is it telegraphs its scares.  What scares us most is what we aren't sure of --  the unknown.  But this movie ladles out its scary beings -- you see them early and often, and there's even the music that assures you that what's happening is scary, just in case you missed the freaky demon-child shadowing our hero.<br /><br />Speaking of whom, character development here is nearly non-existent, so really, who CARES what happens to this generic Hollywood family?  That's not to say the cast don't try, but they aren't given much to work with.<br /><br />This movie is really just another confirmation that a big budget often is a scare-killer.  Having a micro-budget forces you to scare by suggestion, and those are the truest and scariest scares of them all.<br /><br />If you like the by-now familiar bag of tricks in Hollywood's \\"new horror,\\" you may like this.  If for you horror is edge of your seat suspense followed by real frights, Sinister doesn't have much to offer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Liked the book alot a little disappointed in the end. I hoped one of them would turn out to be a good person.  Didn't happen

B008Q08QXE|1.0|We love Jimmy Stewart, but this is a lame movie.  We didn't like any of the characters, even Jimmy's.  Seemed low-budget.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|My holiday treat and something that I will probably watch = the whole series is just great fun and takes me back too many years - and great to have it on blu-ray.
B002R27J1W|5.0|The suspense builds throughout the movie and climaxes at the end.  Audrey Hepburn does an excellent job of portraying a blind woman who slowly unravels what is going on.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Reading the details of what went on that night gave me goosebumps.<br />I have new fond respect for our brave men and women giving up their freedom to protect ours.<br />If you want to get a little bit of sense of what happened on that raid... If you want to open up your mind even just a little bit to see with new eyes of why certain things are necessary in life, than read this.. Don't just chew on what the media feeds you... This gives a whole new light about what soldiers go through to do what they have to do for their country.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is my fav. game on my kindle you should get it there is nothing I don't like I recomend it
B00514HDNW|4.0|This earlier appeared in the Kindle Store as an ebook of 312-pages containing the novella &quot;I Am Legend&quot; AND numerous short stories (referred to in various older reviews). Those additional stories were removed, and the page count was modified to what it presently is (substantially under 175 pages).<br /><br />When I initially read &quot;I Am Legend&quot; in paperback in the 1960's, I was too young to fully appreciate it and was disappointed by its ending. Ten years later I re-read it and was better able to appreciate both the story and its thought-provoking conclusion. However, I was also able to recognize its stylistic imperfections; in particular, specifics and background explanations are sometimes lacking, vague, imprecise and/or contradictory. Nevertheless, it is a good story, and after more recently reading it again, my regard for it remains positive. I do think, however, it has gained a greater reputation and cult-following than it qualitatively deserves. It is good, even arguably very good, but not truly great.<br /><br />So, is it too short? No, not given its ending; any longer to reach that same conclusion would have been mere padding. Is it a SF classic? It is arguably a minor classic within the ranks of vampire tales, but I think it belongs more properly in the horror category since its &quot;science&quot; is on the light side, merely enough to render the global vampire epidemic seemingly plausible enough to permit Matheson to make his essential point regarding majority/minority reversal and what constitutes normalcy (this idea being comparatively superior to its execution, a typical characteristic -- some would say &quot;weakness&quot; -- of early Matheson).<br /><br />Earlier in his career (the period in which &quot;I Am Legend&quot; was written) Matheson was usually better at coming up with imaginative ideas than fully and stylistically developing them; that's why so many of his ideas/stories were better suited to the half-hour television format than to that of the full-length motion-picture. In a shorter venue, a brief exposition would lead to the fully revealed idea, the &quot;punchline&quot; as it were (for example, in a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode). That is also why movie adaptations of his early stories (such as &quot;I Am Legend&quot;) are so very different from the actual stories on which they are based; he supplied the seed-thought, but someone else had to develop a considerably more substantial plot to fill a two-hour time-span. His later works are better-written and more fully developed, two notable novels-to-movies being &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; and the enchanting &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (originally his novel &quot;Bid Time Return&quot;).<br /><br />In &quot;I Am Legend&quot; the title/punchline/theme dominates, and all else (though not without some merit in its own right) is subservient to its revelation. Vampires, once legendary and dreaded have become real and the norm; untainted humanity, once numerically superior and the norm, is down to one (now legendary) individual; hence my reference earlier to majority/minority reversal. Readers initially relate to this seemingly lone human, his plight, and his terror, and as long as the vampires are regarded as monsters to be avoided and/or killed, they are rooting for him. It is when we realize THEIR fear and awe OF HIM (their hunter and slayer) that we perceive the shift. THEY have become the &quot;normal&quot; population, and to them, HE is the awesome and legendary monster!<br /><br />This is certainly thought-provoking, and Matheson can be credited with some degree of prescience inasmuch as we can see similar role reversals that have taken place in today's enlighteded, pluralistic, multi-cultural society: Yesterday's all-but-invisible and/or feared minorities (blacks, homosexuals) today have become visible and mainstream; yesterday's political and/or war-time enemies (U.S. and Japan, U.S. and Viet Nam) have become today's trade-partners and/or allies; and yesterday's societal taboos (marijuana-use, same-sex marriages) have become acceptable practices (to cite just a few such reversals).<br /><br />The theme of this book is certainly well worth pondering, but you will also have to decide if the price (which has fluctuated) is currently a fair one for so short a tale, however good it may be.ade-partners and/or allies; and yesterday's societal taboos (marijuana-use, same-sex marriages) have become acceptable practices (to cite just a few such reversals).<br /><br />The theme of this book is certainly well worth pondering, but you will also have to decide if the price (which has fluctuated) is currently a fair one for so short a tale, however good it may be.
B001AQO3XS|4.0|The upside: They did a fantastic job transferring the film to Blu-ray. You can actually tell when it was the stunt doubles instead of Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery. The downside: the effects look especially cheesy now. Weighing 2 mins of cheesy effects against 3 hours of awesome movie - yeah, it's worth it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game but needs to progress a bit faster. it takes a while to gather money. overall very fun to play
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|I see a lot of people here saying that the Walmart double pack is the issue people should spend their money on.<br /><br />Why would you buy the Walmart version when it is almost guaranteed there will be a Breaking Dawn issued with both extended versions down the road?  If you buy it now it is like paying for Breaking Dawn 1.5, if you account for the loss of bonus features, Breaking Dawn 1.35.<br /><br />Just save your money and do not buy it at all.  That is the only way to get the message across to these stupid companies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS BOOK!! Its a MUST read!! COLLEEN Hoover did an amazing job with the plot. The twists were unexpected. I just loved it so much
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I just discovered this band a few weeks ago and absolutely love it!  Its a sort of mix between Evanescence and Joan Jett.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Another win for Pixar. Wall-E is sweet, endearing, and funny. Entertaining for both adults and kids. Wall-E only has a 3 word vocabulary, but but he has such a big personality, you hardly notice. Brilliantly done!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|does not do order of operations otherwise its a good basic calculator. just need to keep that in mind when using this calculator.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I can't believe all these years I missed this series. One of the best series ever to be on TV. But at least I have gotten to watch it on my Kindle Fire. I highly reccomend watching it and definitley start from the very first episode or you will a lot.
1250007208|2.0|I love sci-fi and fairytale re-telling. With all the praise surrounding Cinder, I was certain this would be my book. It wasn't. I enjoyed Meyer's futuristic interpretation of Cinderella, she had an interesting concept--unfortunately the execution was lacking, especially the clumsy world building. Perhaps I'm Chinese that I am particularly critical of how my culture is being portrayed, and Cinder irritated me on that front. It was also on the predictable side, where we all knew the plot-twist before page 100--yet I was still eager to keep exploring Cinder's eccentric characters.<br /><br />Shallow World-Building, Why not set it in Europe already?: Asian Culture Goes Beyond Cranes, Kimonos, and Dumplings, People!<br />Like the book mentions, the culture in Cinder is really just \\"cobbled together from many [Asian] cultures.\\" Except the main cultures haplessly \\"cobbled\\" together are just the Japanese and Chinese (there are Arabic and Sanskrit influences on a few names, but that's it)...and a large helping of Western culture. Sure, the language and descriptions have figments of Asian (by Asian, I mean only Japanese and Chinese) culture, but the way they act is completely Westernized. The concept of having a \\"ball\\" is completely Western (on another note, why someone would wear a kimono to a dance is beyond me.) So is kissing people on the hand. I am sure the music that was played during the ball was probably Bach or Chopin and not traditional oriental music. And the way Cinder talks her elders? I don't mean to be stereotypical, but if I spoke like that, I would be thrown out of the house.<br /><br />The world in Cinder had all the signs of a Western society, plus maybe a few cranes, bamboo, Buddha dolls--and dumplings.<br /><br />What Happened To The Technology?!<br />Another issue I have with Cinder is that I didn't believe it was set in the future at all. Apparently they've invented androids, cyborgs, hover cars, but why is life still so pitiful? People still have to work in markets out in the open (I guess there's no online shopping anymore?,) actually go to meetings in person, and their medical facilities are just pitiful. On top of it, they have a disease they cant cure so people are dropping like flies. There are auto-drive functions in hover cars, but I guess not in normal cars because Cinder still crashes into a tree.<br /><br />Language: Confusing, Random Honorifics:<br />One of the most confusing, jarring parts of Cinder is their names, along with the honorifics. I rather Meyer forego the use of honorifics altogether since it seems to do more harm than good.<br />In the acknowledgements, Meyer thanks Paul Manfredi Ph.D. for his assistance in Chinese honorifics. I don't have a doctorate degree, but I do speak fluent Chinese so I do think I am qualified to add my two cents on the use of Chinese honorifics. I think Meyer got confused between Japanese and Chinese honorifics. While both cultures use honorifics, Chinese tend to use them to a lesser degree--especially in modern times, and when they ARE used they usually denote a special relationship (along with respect). In Meyer's FAQ section on her website, she explains the usage of a few honorifics:<br />\\"For my futuristic culture, I simplified it to the following five honorifics used in the Eastern Commonwealth:<br /><br />-d&agrave;ren: for a high-ranking official<br />-sh&igrave;fu: for an older male<br />-jūn: for a younger male<br />-jiĕ: for an older female<br />-m&egrave;i: for a younger female\\" -from Marissa Meyer's website<br /><br />Jiĕ and m&egrave;i are the two most commonly used honorifics in Cinder, and their usage always puzzles me and strikes me as clumsy (or unnecessary clunky) writing. Whatever happened to the the honorifics for royalty? How about doctors? And Mr and Mrs?<br /><br />Prince Kai refers to Cinder as Lihn-m&egrave;i, but using m&egrave;i denotes a close relationship. And for a guy to use it, he is usually as close to the girl as he is to a sister (even closer than if he were to use her first name.) It is very surprising for a PRINCE to use it, and to a girl he barely knows!<br /><br />Cinder refers to her mother (albeit stepmother) by her first name, which is just rude. She also refers to her father with his first name. I should just accept that Cinder has barely anything to do with Asian culture.<br /><br />I admit after reading the acknowledgments, I had to wonder just how much help from the PhD Meyer got (so I Googled him.) Or if I was the stupid one who didn't know anything about her own culture and the language she spoke fluently.<br /><br />Names: Wrong Romanization/Pinyin<br />The names in Cinder seem to either come from Chinese or Japanese names. At first I thought the royal family would have Chinese origins since they rule New Beijing after all. But it turns out Japan must've taken over at some point because their names are Japanese (is this Meyer hinting at Japan's superiority over China?.) Rikan can be both Chinese or Japanese, so can Kai. But later I find out Kai is short for Kaito--which can only be derived from Japanese romanization. Curiously, we never get his last name.<br /><br />I can accept the Japanese names, but the Chinese ones are a mess. I appreciate Meyer for putting tone marks on the honorifics, but they don't appear anywhere else. Even without tonemarks Lihn should be \\"pinyinned\\" as Lin. I'm not sure if Nainsi is supposed to be a Chinese derivative of \\"Nancy\\" whoever named her fell asleep on the keyboard, but that n in the middle should not be there. The only one that has a believable Chinese name is Chang Sacha, but then her son (Sunto) is either misspelled or Japanese. For a Chinese-based world, there aren't many Chinese names. Or maybe Chinese names are a pain to pronounce (I know, because I gave up trying to teach people how to pronounce my Chinese name.)<br /><br />Romance:<br />I appreciated that Cinder didn't fall in love at first glance, but I still don't find Prince Kai that appealing. That is probably due to his inappropriate bursts of sarcasm during political meetings.<br /><br />Why Do People Hate Cyborgs Again?<br />From what I gather, cyborgs are still human with a few prosthetics, yet apparently they are hated as second class citizens. Melo-dramatic, much? I am sure if any of those other people ever lost a limb, they would welcome a prosthetic instead of being leg-less for the rest of their life too.<br /><br />Politics, MOON PEOPLE ARE OUT TO GET US. I really Don't Get Politics. Real or Fictional.<br />I admit that I was left confused over how the politics work. Apparently the queen of the moon is going to wage war with Earth if they don't give her control because she's evil and she feels like it...yet she wants to marry a prince ten years her junior even though she has mind-control powers. Why she doesn't use mind-control for world domination to save herself the trouble is beyond me. Why Prince Kai still thinks there's anything worth negotiating is beyond me. Why can't he just send a nuclear bomb over to the moon? Problem solved. But I guess he is all for \\"peace,\\" so bombs are out of the question. I didn't pay too much attention to the political talk since it seemed to get nowhere.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I applaud the depth Meyer gives her characters. Surprisingly, I find the minor characters (Adri and Pearl more appealing than the main ones.) Despite Adri fulfilling the role as evil step-mother, I was sympathetic towards her losses (woman lost her husband and her daughter) and why she blames Cinder because of it. She was a mean grouch, but I thought she had legit reasons for her actions. Unlike the other \\"villain,\\" Queen Levana who is evil and seeks world domination because she can.<br /><br />Cinder, The Mechanic with an Attitude (I think she needs anger management)<br />I love Cinder for her intelligence. She is a determined character that has an heart for people she loves. However, I often want her to chill out.When she meets the doctor who informs her about her past, her society, and Lunars (moon people), she freaks out and starts hyperventilating even though she thinks the doctor could be just a crazy old man. At one point she wants to hit the guy with a wrench, or shoot a bolt of lightning through his head. Poor guy.<br /><br />For some reason Cinder is clueless about her own society and needs to be informed about the black market by a doctor (though I suspect he exists for info-dump purposes.) And people keep telling her national security secrets. After awhile, it gets in her head and she gives herself the responsibility to track down the enemy perpetrator by holding onto a communication chip instead of handing it to authorities. AND THE PRINCE IS OKAY WITH IT. So much for national security. She's a mechanic, not a hacker.<br /><br />Prince Kai, The Guy Who is Sarcastic in the Most Inappropriate Situations:<br />I am not sure being sarcastic to an \\"evil\\" queen with mind control powers is a good idea. While I think his sarcasm is supposed to be funny, I found him childish. I kept wishing he would grow up to prove himself as a great leader instead of trying to be sarcastic all the time. For a prince, he really has too much time on his hands.<br /><br />Word of the Day: Thaumaturge<br />Thaumaturge must be Meyer's favorite word. I can't read \\"thaumaturge\\" without thinking \\"trauma-turd-ist\\" or \\"centrifuge.\\" Can someone tell me if using the word \\"magician,\\" \\"miracle worker,\\" or even \\"dowager\\" is too mainstream?<br /><br />Plot-Twist, I Saw You Coming From Page 100<br />The plot twist was predictable, but I didn't really mind since I was interested in getting to know the world and its interesting characters. Cinder, on the other hand, took a looonnng time to piece it all together (actually, she didn't even piece it all together, which says something about her intelligence.)<br /><br />Sailor Moon!<br />Meyer did write Salor Moon fanfiction, and it's evident some of it seeped into Cinder. *coughSerena...Selenecough*<br /><br />I am sure I'm the minority who didn't fall head over heels into Cinder, and I'm sure a lot of it had to do with the sloppy world-building (which I am biased towards since it is MY culture being portrayed after all.) While I have to give props to Meyers imagination, Cinder didn't appeal to me liked I hoped it would. I read Cinder so I could get to Scarlet, but after Cinder--I am unsure if I want anymore of Meyer's writing. Perhaps Scarlet would be better for me since it is set in France (and thank God not in China.)ue to his inappropriate bursts of sarcasm during political meetings.<br /><br />Why Do People Hate Cyborgs Again?<br />From what I gather, cyborgs are still human with a few prosthetics, yet apparently they are hated as second class citizens. Melo-dramatic, much? I am sure if any of those other people ever lost a limb, they would welcome a prosthetic instead of being leg-less for the rest of their life too.<br /><br />Politics, MOON PEOPLE ARE OUT TO GET US.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|THIS book is great for inspiration for those for us who have our problems, our unwanted looks, and our life.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|put it on, sit back and RELAX... soothing voice over and informative DVD, incredibly beautiful images and amazing footage, this should be where our educational tax dollars go towards.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Noticed DVD package was shrink wrapped but did not contain sealed sticker on case.  Nevertheless, it looked okay and played fine until got into scene 13 where it not only froze, but wouldn't let us fast forward, reverse, or even skip.  Tried it on 3 differed DVD players and had same result!  It eventually skipped way ahead, missing some of the best highlights of the movie. Upon further inspection, found faint scratches on disc...clearly not new condition as described.
