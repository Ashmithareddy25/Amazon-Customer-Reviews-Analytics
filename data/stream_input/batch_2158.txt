B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great book - one of the better ones I've read lately.  A little far-fetched at times, but it's different than the usual mystery, which is always a good thing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is somewhat entertaining to play but also frustrating when the gorilla gets you.  You have to get used to the swiping motion
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|A great DVD transfer was done on this one. This is one of the all time Biblical Epics that Hollywood ever released.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|This movie is great! It's mysterious, dark, and haunting. The kind of movie that stays with you for a while. I had seen it when it came out in the movies and had been meaning to see it again for a while. I am glad I finally did see it. It's a must watch for anyone who likes horror movies that do not try to make you *jump out of your chair* every five seconds. This is a well though-out, masterfully executed piece of filmmaking.
B002O3Z4QQ|3.0|After you have watched about half of it you will find that we have landed on the moon. The rest of the series deals with mundane things that the astronauts or their family went through.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun I love all the games u can play u need the right amout of coins to get the game.this is why I love this game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|if you love Batman this is the set to have. The additional behind the scenes DVD is full of really good stuff!
B004EVNPGW|5.0|To add about this wonderful, beloved and excellent album. Nothing. It aweson and spectacular from start to finish. Another genius of S & G. The sound is impeccable.<br />Take a look: the deluxe release of two CDs + DVD, brings the original record (without bonus tracks) on CD 1, CD 2 brings a concert from 1969 (not bring alternative versions as advertised in the track list) and the DVD contains the making of.<br />if you expect the alternate versions, you're not going to find.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|awesome book loved all three. I will read it again.... have told everyone to read it!!<br />Can't wait for more from the author
B0000C16OQ|4.0|This edition has a second CD with instrumental versions, alternatives, sing a long, etc, that gives a bonus to a disk connected to a beautiful era.<br />the sound is excellent, which gives you a few extra points. Recommended for those who like soundtracks. This is already a classic.<br /><br />esta edicion tiene un segundo cds, con versiones instrumentales, alternativas, sing a long, etc, que le dá un extra a un disco relacionado a una hermosa época pasada.<br />el sonido es excelente, lo que le dá unos puntos extra. Recomendado para quienes gusten de las bandas de sonido. Esta ya es un clásico.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard all the hype and thought it might be time to see if it is all true. Even knowing some/most of the plot, I found this a great read with some surprises.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I liked it but I do not think that there was much of a plot or a problem. No climax but it had a good message.
1451695195|5.0|I've read many near death experience books but this one is very special.  The writer paints a very vivid picture of each detail of his NDE.  It moves quickly and is very well written.
B00280LYIM|5.0|very very very very GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. VERY exciting and funny. I love this series.it is very interesting. I love it so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Interesting twist to a teenage love story.  Typical teenage angst that takes you on an interesting journey into their past connection.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had me intrigued,laughing,crying and behind on laundry I couldn't put it down u never know what someone's life has taken them through
B0076DELIG|3.0|I think Harry is ready to retire.  He's no longer a completely believable character to me.  A policeman simply would be without value at the current age Harry is supposed to be.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|As I finished this book l morn the loss of Chris knowing his fate. Myself a fellow brother in arms extend my condolences to his wife,children and family. This nation has lost in every sense of the word a True American Hero! Thanks Chris to you and your family for your sacrifices to this country.
B008JFUMT2|2.0|I'm a fan of the Die Hard franchise.  Up until A Good Day to Die Hard, the Die Hard series has been on an amazing run with excellent action stories.  A Good Day to Die Hard has lots of action, but it leaves me longing for more story.  The script is very weak.  Hope the next one will be better.
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|I loved this movie! I have been a Fan of all things Resident Evil... I cant wait to see another one! Would recommend to anyone!
0385738765|5.0|You experience the uncertainty of the trials right along with the gladers, and find yourself holding your breath in hopes for the best. Great second book!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|The movie was decent but not the best i have even seen... Loved the selection of Music though. If you like 80's Hair Bands it might be a okay movie for you.
0385738781|5.0|A great end to a great series. Yes, I did cry several times. I fell in love and became so invested in the characters. Brilliant writing.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Fantastic movie!!! Great Action movie all the way!!!! Would recommend to anyone!!! A must see movie if you are looking for a good movie!
0385737955|5.0|Brilliantly unique and captivating with characters that will steal your heart. It had my heart pounding with his perfectly crafted suspense of impending doom.This series is a must read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run two is awesome it has curves which I've always wanted and it's just so much better than temple<br /><br />Dylan Hillmer1214@gmail
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I enjoyed this story & had a hard time setting it down. I am looking forward to the discussion at our book club.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|My purchase arrived at the exact time, and it was intact a really good service and it is one of my favorite series of all the time!!
B007N579X6|4.0|This was almost a five star if it wasn't for the audio languages available, the &#34;spanish&#34; audio is actually a &#34;Spain&#34; spanish version.. It wasn't funny at all!!
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|Quirky and fun, like many of Bryson's books.  I read it while I was traveling in Australia and it was better than my tour books!
B007Y612KA|4.0|enjoyable tip of the hat to a vintage style from a lost film era. young kids may not like it as much as modern film styles but very enjoyable!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I bought this for my wife.  She is a big fan of the movie, and watches it every time she finds it on the cable.  Interesting and different story, with some very funny lines and situations.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition is good for the extras (and because it's Blu-ray, which gives you a beautiful picture!)  We've watched the Director's Cut, which is where the Director explains some of the &#34;hows and &#34;whys&#34; of the shots, and what motivated him to shoot scenes a certain way.
B007EECSFA|5.0|An intriguing story, a triangle of sorts, that takes place during WW2 in England. The story is told from present day as well, as the main character's oldest daughter tries to sort out her dying mother's past. The ending is a shocker!
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Bujold never fails to amuse and entertain; this offering in her long-running series is solid and mature. Don't be put off by the fact it isn't about Miles, you'll enjoy it just as much!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|classic they dont make chtristmas shows or movies good anymore no tradionals all commerical, grabs your heart to warm it
B000VMFDW2|5.0|very well written. A fascinating read. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know what war is like.
B0040I09RM|5.0|If you liked The Sopranos, you'll love SOA!<br />Rough, tough, very well written.<br />Be warned: It's riveting, addictive, and violent.<br />Katey Sagal (from Married With Children) will take you by surprise,<br />and hopefully for your sake, not by the neck.<br />Send the kids to bed and hang on for one wicked ride.<br />Highly recommended.
0765325950|5.0|A worthy ending to an epic series, A Memory of Light is the 14th and final installment in the Wheel of Time series. Each book is ~900 pages, so if you include the prequel, that's >13,000 words. It's Tolkien's Lord of the Rings on steroids.<br /><br />The series is a classic good vs. evil story with a cast of characters from different cultures. The world building behind these books is amazing and the back story is rich. The idea is that the Dark One who is outside time, is escaping from the prison where he was locked away from the world. There is only one hero who can face and defeat him. Of course, that hero needs the help of the world--anyone fighting on the side of the Light. This book is the culmination of quests, politics, hunts, and plots leading up to the epic Last Battle (a single chapter of 190 pages). Good finally faces evil and... well, I can't tell you who wins. Let's just say I was satisfied with the outcome.<br /><br />Theology:  Should we eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?<br /><br />There are a lot of parallels in The Wheel of Time with biblical theology. The Wheel of Time was made by the Creator who locked the Dark One away from the Pattern much like one day Satan and his minions will be locked away in the abyss for a thousand years (Revelatioin 20:3). After a thousand years, Satan will be released and will gather together a great force for the final epic battle where the evil army will surround the saints in the \\"beloved city\\" (Revelation 20:7-10). Good prevails and Satan and his minions are locked away for eternity and a new age begins.<br /><br />That's essentially a fair summary of The Wheel of Time. The Dark one was released on the earth to torment people until the Last Battle where he will either prevail or be banished by the Dragon Reborn (our hero, born again prior to the Last Battle). After the Last Battle, a new age begins. Unlike the Bible, this is one of many ages. The battle against good and bad happen over and over again. Each time, the Dragon is reborn (reincarnated) to fight the Dark One.<br /><br />Interestingly, the Dragon must struggle with how to fight the Dark One. Should he lock him away again? Should he kill him? Should he set him free? The story to some extent explores free will vs. predestination. Can there be a good without bad to counter it? What were Adam and Eve like before they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Did they have free will if they didn't have knowledge of evil? Do you have choice when you can't make a wrong decision?<br /><br />I don't know the answers to these questions, but I know that God does. For me, I would love to be incapable of making a wrong decision. I don't want to suffer, die, be sick, be sad, worry, etc. Get rid of the evil and bring on the New Heaven and New Earth.<br /><br />But the Creator in these books is a distant force. Life is shaped by the Pattern--life is like a tapestry and each person is one of the strings. Fate is left largely to change and personal decisions.<br /><br />Rating:  PG<br /><br />While there is cursing, it's specific to the fantasy world: Light! Blood and bloody ashes! Etc. There's not really any sex, although one character is \\"married\\" (I'm using that term loosely) to three women. Everyone else is paired off and properly married. There is a lot of war and killing in this book but it's not overly graphic. There's no blood spurting or entrails flapping.  Of course, it's a 900 page book so it's meant for older readers.<br /><br />Social issues:<br /><br />There's drinking and gambling by one rogue character (who happens to be my favorite, actually). But most of the intrigue is politics, plots, and getting everyone coordinated for the Last Battle. There's no time for social issues.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Story is good, acting is good, music is good, but mare than anything, the movie is visually gorgeous. All in all, worth owning. I'd watch it again...
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|You know the chemistry you feel on a first date where your stomach is aflutter and you're excited about the potential of something?  The second season of Suits picks up on the high note where the first season left off.  Suits 2 reminds us that things can indeed get better upon greater intimacy.<br /><br />The good - snarky Donna (amazing chemistry between Sarah Rafferty and Gabriel Macht makes them irresistible on screen), kooky Louis (Rick Hoffman channeling William Shatner in Boston Legal), cool Jessica (although Gina Torres can be cooler - see Firefly) and some of the best side characters on TV - hilarious dorky Harold (Max Topplin) and the embodiment of why we all hate lawyers Daniel Hardman (played with soft-spoken subtlety by David Costbile)<br /><br />The best - a more humanly nuanced characterization of Harvey played by Gabriel Macht.  We finally get to see more of our favorite sonuva-attack dog lawyer and let's face it, isn't that what we all want?  We want Harvey to be like a redeemed Grinch, but we don't want him too nice, because that would be boring.<br /><br />The bad - not loving the story line the writers give Mike Ross. (Patrick J. Adams does his best to make us love him, but the writers have Mike making decisions that are annoying and highly suspect for someone who's a genius.)<br /><br />Rachal Zane (beautiful Meghan Markle) needs better stuff to work with here, too.  The whole father's approval story line is tired people. She could act that in her sleep.  ZZZZZZZzzzzz<br /><br />That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5.  You take the good, you take the bad - you take 'em both and now you have a pretty damn good legal drama without the sophomore slump.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|A tad disjointed, but the Hunger Games Series, when all compiled, should be better than just one piece of it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very interesting book.i thoroughly enjoyed the authors description, insight and roundness of the characters even though they were both rather cunning and not too pleasant. Some of it was implausible though, as to how far she went, mutilating herself etc.not very realistic.
B004TSKKE0|4.0|The kindle version, which is easy to carry around, has its share of minor, though annoying, typos. Also, the sheer magnitude of the work is not as evident as in the printed-book version. Very convenient for the footnotes, however, as you simply click back and forth to view them as you read, whereas I find it tiring to look them up and get back to the text in the book.
B005HSL626|5.0|GREATEST Game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is the best game ever hours of fun great for long trips or just waiting for the doctors BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!! your life is incopmplete without it :)
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Love it love it!<br />I recommend it to everyone in the world!!!!!<br />Super duper cool. Excellent exciting and awesome!!!!! Rider rules!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is great! It always gets me up at 5:45am so I can get up and go to school
B000MRAAJM|5.0|if you haven't seen it...see it. if you haven't seen it in HD, see it in HD. what else can i say?
B00846F1YW|5.0|Liked the first mysteryville and I am really enjoying this new one. Thank you Amazon for making it the free app of the day!
B005DNBDXM|4.0|As for the movie, it's good but not great. If it weren't for Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall and the great graphics (at the time) this movie would probably not be too appealing. The story is good but the other actors are lacking, not too mention the cheesy parts the movie is interlaced with.<br />As for the streaming, I have a great internet connection, which probably helps a lot. The service works great. The picture quality was very good, the sound was also good and the movie loaded and played without any problems. Netflix better watch out ;)
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Including Spain in the history of WWII was an interesting departure from the normal story . The segments about Germany and Russia are wel documented and known. I found the book to be written somewhat juvenile and more like a romance novel. Not my favorite Follett book, which I usually love.
B0012BQ60O|5.0|I bought this for my four year old and he loves it.  I love that the quality is great and that its very realistic looking.  We also bought a dragon from the same company.
B00340LM8C|5.0|One of my favorite Cary Grant movies. Good story, well acted, beautiful scenery. Of  course, Grace Kelly is beautiful as well. The whole movie is easy on the eyes!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombies, what's not to love about this season.  I especially like that the main group is encountering more humans, makes for &#34;oh, what's going to happen now&#34; moments.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I felt like the author was trying to rush to the end. However, the book was happy, sad, heartbreaking at times, but good.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|another g5 game with outstanding graphics. nice to see native American culture and story line. the game was relatively short..took about an hour to play and yet its 4.99 for the game...one of the highest priced ones ive come across from g5. feels like a ripoff since its so short in playtime.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game and ever since I got it I've been checking how my dragons are doing or forming a new island every day when I come home from school. Overall it is very fun. Buy it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased this item .,..did the water test on it as required prior to putting product on phone...it failed...water was inside product...did test two more times ...water still.....put product on phone anyways till I could have situation handled...people could not hear me when I spoke on the phone...contacted LifeProof as instructed...supplied them with serial numbers from front and back of product ....they informed me it was a counterfeit product.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I've fallen in love with Kate Morton's stories. Loved the House at Riverton.  I only wish she had more. I'm currently reading The Distant Hours.
B00867GHS8|2.0|Received my 3D movie yesterday, played it last night and am disappointed in the 3D quality.  The movie, of course, is great but am not impressed with the quality of it being in 3D.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app. My devotions daily on this this. Very good devotionals plus you have access to bunches of coherent versions, like having parallel Bible.
B00ADYYY50|4.0|Very nice beats, and alot of songs about smoking weed and spending money. But I guess you can consider this a \\" gettin mine and I got it\\" album then huh? It's all good tho cuz I like all those things myself!! Already! H-Town
B002JWD6AS|4.0|It is a darker and different twist on werewolves. And in the end there isn't a forever or happily ever after for them. There is an actual time struggle for the main coupling. And that gives it realism. A few things were off but all and all a great novel.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Loved this App the first month I had it. It is highly addictive and rewarding to unlock new characters and items. Then one day I went to use it and my high score was there but nothing else including my in-app purchases. It's lots of fun but don't get too attached to it. Like many other reviewerss on here, my Kindle version crashed too and reset everything.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a great writer and has a way of really writing characters that you can like and fall in love with. The way they interact and the problems in thier way that seem sometimes ridiculous but sometimes a horror that could happen to any of us. I hope to see more from this author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Who would have thought they could actually make a zombie show that wasnt as brain dead as the zombies!!!!<br />Love this show.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Who doesn't love Ms. Jones? She is a great story teller, her humor and way of writing keeps you enthralled. And this in and of itself is a classic.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I initially watched this movie on netflix out of sheer boredom. This movie got me hooked on the show Firefly. Many will have seen the show already, but its a really well done movie, lots of action, fun space, sci-fi nerdy stuff. If you're into that, you'll dig the movie. Even if you're not, my significant other even enjoys it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I haven't read a series that really kept my attention until now!!! This is awesome can't wait to read the last two books.
B0087DFIYA|2.0|The seller was excellent, and it arrived on time.<br />The movie wasn't at all what we expected. Was not the Mel Gibson we are familiar with.<br />Would not recommend the movie.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|Love the movie and love the music. I like the jazz and how they only &#34;speak&#34; when neccessary. The music is balanced with the singing
0060578793|5.0|I feel a great deal safer after reading this. I'm going to go through it multiple times so if I am ever in a survival situation I will be safer with my knowledge.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very exciting trying to cut up the fruit.  Challenges your visual and finger dexterity especially when the bombs come into play.
B0007939NO|5.0|This movie is in surprisingly great quality considering the age of the film itself. My VHS version a long time ago was a bit faded in color but in the DVD the colors and images come back to life. The sound and quality overall are just terrific. The soundtrack is great as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the feature that automatically brings the cards to the appropriate pile and the random dealing is amazing with the sound effects.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I do always read them before I download a book. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is the book for you. The basic storyline is your typical small town girl running away from a past and a hottie alpha male who thinks he is God's gift to women. She tries to fight his charms and he never gives up on getting her attention. However unlike some other books I have read,I found myself on the edge of my seat at every turn of the page. I couldn't put the book down and I read it in a few hours. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Harder than I thought it would be - I keep crashing the poor boy into jumps and trains.  Love the sound effects.
0394721772|5.0|Great for any level of Cook!<br />When you actually take the time for Delicious, Real, Cooking!<br />yum, yuM,yUM & YUM!
B0067AC5KA|4.0|This book was very intense at times but very boring at other times.  Couldn't  put it down in the end.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I had not seen it in its uncut version, ever, and I had not seen it in a decent format. This was both, and it was a pleasure.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|If you only have time to read one book of this type, go for Service instead.  It's more detailed, covering broad actions and detailed firast person encounters.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|First of all, watching this on Amazon Instant is close to impossible. THe whites are totally blown out, the black are completely clogged and have no definition and as this movie takes place in a cave for much of it, you can't even see the art direction, which is presumably one of the redeeming qualities of the film. But really this movie just falls flat.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I thought this movie looked great in the preview, but when my husband and I rented it it started off right away with the unnecessary and long duration nudity scenes...  We didn't even get to the halfway point before we shut it off...  Unfortunate because the movie seemed to have had a great storyline without all the language and nudity...  Wish I could get my money back...
B000002IAZ|4.0|BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD-RETROSPECTIVE: L.A. based country rock pioneers BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD contained far too much raw singing/songwriting/guitar picking talent...STEVE STILLS, RICHIE FURAY, NEIL YOUNG (who drove down from his native Toronto in a hearse), and eventually JIMMY MESSINA...to last beyond three albums, from which RETROSPECTIVE cherry picks their finest moments. Those highlights include STILLS' protest classic FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH (their lone Top 40 hit) and sprawling, bluegrass-driven BLUEBIRD, YOUNG's psychedelia-laced offerings MR. SOUL and BROKEN ARROW, and FURAY's plaintive KIND WOMAN. FURAY, who possessed the most technically perfect singing voice of the three, also lent his pipes to YOUNG's energetic ON THE WAY HOME. Inevitable creative differences, the bane of many a band from THE BEATLES on down, plagued them almost from the start, although successful follow up projects such as CROSBY, STILL, NASH & YOUNG, POCO and LOGGINS & MESSINA continued the SPRINGFIELD's organic folk-pop quest, leading the charge for the early seventies' singer-songwriter boom.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR BUFFALO NICKELS
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I first began this game, I thought it wasn't that scary. Boy, was I wrong!! I get goosebumps just thinking about this game. If a game has that kind of affect on me, then I KNOW its GOOD!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  I loved it!  Couldn't put it down once I started reading it!  Very interesting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm addicted to playing this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because when you win a hand, you have to wait for the cards to stop flying around in shapes to play a new game. And they do that for about ten seconds.<br />Maybe I'm just impatient, but I find this kind of annoying.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Whitney Houston was the best!  She will always be missed!  Thank you for her music, this is a great CD!  Whitney Houston is one of the world's greatest artist.....gone to soon!!!!
B002N44XSG|4.0|I really like these kind of books cause they have so much plot and mystery and danger and excitement the y really surprised u
B004Y1USJE|5.0|Amazing album from an old band. I love how these guys manage to integrate contemporary sound with their typical sound of the old days. I can't count how many times I've listened to this album and it just grows on me. Way to go YES!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I really like this game...but it's hard to see. I like the challenge but the designs are small on the Kindle Fire HD, clear but small.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I downloaded it so my daughter can play it. She plays it everyday. I guess its a fun game because she can't get enough of it
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Great series, and easy to buy, download and convenient for me to switch to my Sony Blu-ray to watch.  No need for me to wait for Netflix DVD.
B0095P29EG|2.0|I paid for an HS movie that was not in HD<br /><br />a a a a a a a a a
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I looked at this series for years before I purchased my first book.  I thought it would be more fantasy, but not true.  I recommend the entire series.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I bought it but has not been used as I thought I would. It is not easy to connect the camera or card. Also it reduces the resolution of the pictures from the camera to ipad. I am still using the computer.
0440245206|1.0|If only I had read the reviews before I wasted money on this purchase. The book was dull, badly written, repetitious, predictable ... I couldn't force myself to read beyond 150 pages. I realize romance novels are not usually good literature, but this was just awful!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|The movie is awesome and I am very pleased with the quality of the dvd 3d and digital copy. I really like the adaptation of Thor to the big screen.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is challenging enough to get you motivated to play it and keep trying to beat your previous time.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I loved the movie and glad Star Trek is back. The DVDs are great and I am pleased with the digital copy which is easy to download via itunes.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is the beginning of a great fantasy adventure. As soon as i started reading this, i just couldnt stop, so addictive, i wanted know whats going to happen next. I was thrilled with the story line and loved the mystery of not knowing whats ahead. A definate read for Morgans fans, and just couldnt wait to read the next book in this series.
B001FB55H6|4.0|The movie is awesome, and watch it again with the extended scenes it is another experience indeed.<br />The only downsize is no digital copy, otherwise I would give 5 starts.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I was skeptical that I wouldn't enjoy the book bc it didn't feature Miles, but Ivan is a terrific character that really did need to be developed, fulfilled, and completed. I'm so glad she did. It's the true sequel to Diplomatic Immunity, and a very rewarding read following the less enthusiastic Cryoburn.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|This is the best movie from the James Bond saga. I loved the delete scenes, too. It is not 5 stars just because it did not come with the digital copy to carry with my ipad
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I am a 3rd grade teacher and I found many of the ideas in this book can be very helpful to teachers, but we need Shawn to spend more time thinking about how his principles can benefit schools. I have been talking about this book with colleagues but I am afraid I may not be articulating Shawn's ideas as well as he could.  We need you to make the connections between your ideas and schools.<br />Thanks for the great ideas!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I loved the movie and it is one that everyone needs to buy. The downsize is that it does not have digital copy to carry on my Ipad
B001O2QW9G|5.0|The giant Turtle is really Great. He reminds me of Lonesome George. My grandsons were very interested in Turtles large enough to ride. This little guy has been an educational tool for them.
B005IZLPME|5.0|The movie is awesome and I am very pleased with the quality of the dvd 3d and digital copy.I really like the adaptation of Captain America to the big screen and connection with Avengers
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book reaffirms the fact that we are all brothers and sisters in Gods world.  Wars are the making of arrogant human error!,  Suffering  and  sacrifices  for those errors are paid by all!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The goal may be a bit on the dark side (wipe out humanity and make sure no one lives) but this game is ridiculously fun.<br /><br />you start off by picking a plague. select a country and get ready to bring pandemonium to humanity. it becomes a lot more complex than this, which is key to being able to replay this game without getting too bored.<br /><br />Each plague plays differently from one another. you may have the fungus which is quite stable and gives you control over how it evolves, or a virus, which could mutate without your input and forces you to spend energy to control it. Countries will also play differently. do you pick a populous country to infect as many people as possible, or do you infect an island country like Greenland since they are the hardest countries to infect. how about Canada? a country that is very likely to cost you a game, but with them being a rich country, it could be a gamble which will ruin you early on too if discovered too quickly.<br /><br />I could write more on how in depth and complete this game feels, but I'll try to sum it up with this statement: a game with this much depth, and as polished as Plague Inc. should be priced more than this. Bravo on making such a superb game at a price that makes it accessible to many.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have a 3D Vizio TV and this is the perfect movie to showcase the technology.  The picture quality and use of 3D are so vivid, you will love it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hoping to find a book to become entertained/absorbed in and Gone Girl was just the one. Couldn't put it down. Both Nick and Amy were fascinating characters, and I, not being the murder-mystery type, was surprised just how much I enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was trying to open this then my kindle fire said unable to open so deleted the app then went back to the appstore and tried to download it but when I got to that page in the appstore, it said open instead of install.  WHAT DO I DO
B00AREIAI8|4.0|sometimes it locks up but I love this game! I also think it needs more games in the stable and in competitions without using up so much of its energy.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I was amazed at how much the series followed the books.  The dragons in the last episode I found to be a little far out but I  really enjoyed the first season and am looking for to watching the 2nd season.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has more twists than Lombard Street in San Fran. It was strange, different, full of the unexpected and once I got about a quarter of the way into it, I had real trouble putting it down. Looking forward to an earlier bedtime tonight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would recommend. Its a nice little simple solitaire game. No fancy bull, and its customizable so its not boring to look at.
0307279189|5.0|This has been a very interesting book! I have been recommending it to all of my friends who are runners and wanna-be runners.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|Has amazing beats, great rythem audio and T.I. are just amazing :) one of T.I.'s best albums yet ponk is great with T.I.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I saw this. Great series. Tarian Lanister, has to be one of the most intriguing character ever written. And this sprawling series keeps you on your toes. You cannot even imagine what's going to happen next. Can't wait 'til season 3.
0470913029|4.0|This book explains the reasons for the  Paleo diet and what it is. This establishes a very good basis for anyone. I used it as a starting point and then got the Paleo Diet for Athletes to refine my diet for competition and athletic endeavors.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This film, staring the beautiful and talented Emily Blunt, was wonderful. Rupert Friend plays the adorable Prince Albert, who's chemistry with Emily (the young &#34;Victoria&#34;) was palpable and so amazing. The evil, wickedly bad Sir John Conroy, played by the talented Marc Strong was a casting coup. Well acted, well filmed, beautiful costumes. The story line keeps you interested throughout the entire film. The ending was so well written. This one will definately make you shed a tear or two. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. You'll be very glad you did!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|every song was great and catchy even my mom love the CD and got one for herself can't wait to his concert
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great action scenes, although a little unbelievable. Good story. A bit anticlimactic ending. Excellent acting, especially the villain. Worth a rental, but probably not a purchase.
0763655465|4.0|Good lessons for kids learning right from wrong.  Makes them think about why they get in trouble when they make poor choices. Also good for learning about temptations.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My son and I have a competition going to see who can get to the next level first and how many coins/puzzle pieces we can get.<br />Fun, entertaining.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I find the series one of the best programs I have ever watched.  Not only is it historically correct, but the entire theme of the show is totally mesmerizing.  I can not wait for the next show.  Thank you to all envolved!
B002KGEORM|5.0|I just started watching this series and now I can't stop.  The story line is fast paced, characters are excellent!
034580404X|5.0|Amazing book.  Once you get past the &#34;questionable&#34; material.  The book starts a little dark and heavy but ends fabulously.  There are twists in it that aren't expected but make it all the more enjoyable!  I'm glad I read it.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I am still trying to read this book.  It is difficult to get into, but I haven't given up yet.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was certainly one of the best &#34;syfy&#34; shows ever  produced, so of course the idiots who run television programing canceled it almost at once. These are the same &#34;boobs&#34; who let crap like &#34;Fringe&#34; go on and on with utter, completely idiotic nonsense season after season.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It's been said the only thing certain in life is change.  With that in mind it's only fitting that as the silver screen revs up to celebrate 50 years of James Bond and 007 flicks, that MI6 undergo transformation.  It's time for the post-WWII children and the Baby Boomers to grab their hats and coats, put in for their pensions and whatever is left of their 401Ks, and turn the Bond Agency over to the next generation.  Spoiler:  How do scriptwriters force old-timers, who simply don't know when it's time to leave, to depart gracefully?  Along with &#34;cleaning&#34; the writers became witty enough to begin preparing Bond fans for what will inevitably be the departure of the current Bond (played by Daniel Craig -- the best 007 since Connery).  Sadly to say viewers are forced to accept the reality that Bond and 007 are not the man, but the office he holds and the duties he is assigned.  With all this in mind, viewers must now start doing some intense soul-searching and ask themselves if the next Bond/007 can be a woman or a man of color.  After all, the only thing for certain in life is change.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Diamonds shouldn't be required as the only option for things to be free it should at least make everything available through gameplay... I don't mind the micro transactions as long as everything is available still through gameplay.  The energy time is too slow though... I assume I can pay to speed that up for limited time. I loss interest by the time I get energy to do anything.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so much fun!!! And it's free!!! I love it so much then it gets faster and faster really fun!!!!
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|talk about dynamic tension! take a look at the smoldering dance between the two stars about 1/2 way through the movie! hot!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was very fun it takes too much time to load though. It is a different experience as I actually don't like horses in real life
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I found this book to be very engaging and I learned a couple of things, too.  I would highly recommend this book to others.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am really enjoying this series of books! What an incredible,yet dark, mind the author has. It's not just for teen readers.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It was fast-paced and a page-turner.  I had a hard time putting this book down.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|Most of King's books do not translate to film very well, but this one is an exception.  Sissy Spacek does a great job and the special effects are, especially for the time, very effective.  A different kind of horror film and well worth watching.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother who doesn't have HBO.....I know he's enjoyed watching it!  So glad to have found it!
1606995359|5.0|Unlike the dark, gloomy and often violent \\"graphic novels\\" of today, the old time comic books were light and fun.  Silly, maybe, but fun to read.  Carl Barks is, to me, unarguably  the greatest Disney comic book writer/artist/creator of all time.  You can thank him for Donald Duck's best adventures and for the invention of \\"Gyro Gearloose, Uncle Scrooge McDuck and a host of others.  This book has some of his best work and is a joy to read.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm not sure how long I can stand to wait for the 6th and 7th books to be released.  The books were very intense but well worth the time to read them.  George R.R. Martin needs to get a move on!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The potentials and possibilities of humanity told through the story of a young boy; this story is a must read.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I really like this app.  It allows me to access my acct at any time wherever I am and check on my orders and shop also.
0375413405|4.0|and I could have done without it for another 40 years.  Too pedantic. It really doesn't take much to boil peas with carrots in a bit of lemon juice.  French cooking is an art though. Much ado about nothing.
1609611543|5.0|I listened to the audible audio version and it was excellent.  The history of wheat is throughly covered.  One key thing that I realized from listening to this is that hybridized grains/wheat can be just as problematic as GMO grains.  Many so-called healthy whole grain products will boast non-GMO, but their product's wheat is still hybridized and very different from the original eincorn variety and this book made me more aware of that.  In addition to the history of wheat, the author also covers the health aspect in detail and also the lack of testing of the effects of hybridized wheat consumption.
159420411X|4.0|I bought this book based largely on reading of the fabulous success that Nate Silver enjoyed last fall in predicting the results of the elections.  However, although Silver never discusses his methodology of political forecasting, I found I learned a great deal about how to think about the ways to evaluate different outcomes of future events. I even learned about the math behind Bayesian theory!<br /><br />I only give the book four stars, however, because I was disappointed that Silver never discussed his real specialty of political forecasting.  How could he be &#34;91% confident&#34; last year that Obama would win the election when most other polls showed the race a dead heat? What makes his work so different than, say, the Gallup polls?<br /><br />By focusing on areas that he has only briefly studied - the stock market; global warming, etc. - I felt that we missed a number of true insights.  Hopefully Nate will write another book!
B00136JPB0|5.0|GRACE is an outstanding recording from start to finish, delivering goosebumps and displaying extraordinary talents of the late Jeff Buckley.  He is sorely missed.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|This movie had so much to offer, especially to mothers: watching/helping a child overcome disability and discrimination, letting go of one's child, reward for good parenting, the impact of good mentors, repeatedly bouncing back from discrimination and not giving up, taking on a macho industry and winning, gaining a better understanding and appreciation for autism, the unique perspective every individual brings, etc. Claire Danes did a fantastic job with her role, as did the actresses playing her mother and aunt.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Though some may find the elegant and superbly written setups tedious, I believe the author is simply brilliant. Few people ever, let alone living, accomplish the exquisite level of descriptive prose presented here. A fitting begining indeed, to a momentous story.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found this book hard to get into.  It was boring and I didn't like how slow it read.<br />I say no.
B003O86FMW|5.0|And I've read it before!!! Truly an instant classic series, and one I'll revisit like an old friend. Can't wait for the next two movies!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's is great to have my music at the click of a button when need.  It is easy, fast, clean and the delivery is perfect for everyone especially people on the go with limited time.
B001VNB54A|4.0|Overall I liked Band Of Brothers a bit more but showing home life and time away from the front added some extra dimension to the characters in The Pacific.
B003WKOU0G|3.0|The movie was interesting. The babies were very cute to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone expecting, it really opens your eyes.
1926667131|5.0|This is a great course and I can't wait to finish it! I know my life will never be the same.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This season just like the first season was wonderful. I love the graphics and the story. It's tense and heartwarming at times.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Denzel is at his best. Vivid portrayal of man with great skills as a pilot/captain but struggling with alcohol and drug addiction.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Everyone was right when it came to this cpu.  I have it liquid cooled and my ASUS MB was able to overclock it to 4.8ghz!!  Can't explain enough how great this chip is.  Unless you need to compile and edit files and video, no need for the hyper threading.  If you are simple like me and love you gaming and simple tasks after that, this is the way to go!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book, but not from the outset. I found it took a while to identify with the main character but once I did I was hooked. I think it is such a simple tale but it looks into peoples ways, personalities, emotions and psychology in a very in-depth but easy manner. Harold is such a lovable character you just wish the best for him at all times. I think it touches on how easy it easy for couples to lose touch with one another for no reason and to allow it to continue to happen. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. It is an easy but worthwhile read. Rachel has a really smooth and soft way of writing.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|I have watched it three times and I am fascinated each time. This is truly worth buying and is addictive. Gives we Americans some insight as to the working of the British Parliment.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game is a really good game very addicting but always get stuck waiting to get investment points to expand land wish there were more games like this but good job on the game I would suggest this to anyone
B0063IH60K|5.0|This one plays as good or better than any others I've used. I have zero complaints or negative comments about the games or settings.  Ads are generally not obtrusive, but if an ad free version were available I would buy it.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Should have had a build up to the crash everythings happens at the beginning. Slow after that and not very interesting
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Why keep Gotham around? The movie once again threatened Gotham with it's destruction, snore... I found myself really just completely bored with the whole concept. The pace was slow, the story uninteresting, the characters worn out...<br />The biggest mistake from my perspective was the breaking of the invisible boundries of Gotham, I realize the previous movies also did this, but I still felt like Gotham was somehow isolated from the rest of the world in the first 2... I lost that feeling here and it really broke the Batman mytique for me.<br /><br />Bane's voice is incredibly annoying.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Great high action movie with a unique plot. Kept me and my wife interested the whole ride. Good movie for sure!!!!
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|I RedBoxed it last night, and was disappointed I hadn't financed a theater viewing. I'm a horror fan from way back but few are worthy of my DVD collection. This one, however........Yikes!  I watched it alone, and started wondering if I'd have nightmares..........ME! A horror fan since The Exorcist.......LOL!  Highly recommend it for horror connoisseurs. Yeah, he could've flipped on a light, but otherwise........genuinely Scary!
145210655X|5.0|This is a very cute book. I bought one for my boy and he loves it. I also bought one for my older brother to share with his boy. It's amazing how Star Wars can keep sucking us in to keep buying their items.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good graphics entertaining just what i was looking for.  try it you will like it..my kids and i did you will also
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It's totally an alien prequel. Sorry if I spoil that for some of you but I knew ahead of time and it made me pay attention even more. Get it, great movie!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Demille writes another great John Corey story.  Will anger the left leaning group who still don't understand the Middle East.  He calls it like it is over there....enjoy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!!  I love the mobile app so while I am sitting watching TV with my family I can browse Pinterest and find all sorts of fun stuff.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Ok...so a lot of people have already said this, but it is a decent game it is just unfortunate that (a) the game is tied so intimately with Facebook and (b) that the  credits needed to progress in the game either take forever to accrue or you have to spend A LOT of real money...not cool...I wanted a sim city type of game and this could be it if it wasn't so expensive to have a decent experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I recently downloaded this game for my kids to play.  The funny thing is I really enjoy playing this game too.  The graphics and sounds are awesome.  Great time waster.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I love this author, this is the 3rd book that I have read and he is an amazing writer who has you captivated from beginning to end !!! Loved this book
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I downloaded this game for my kids to play because it was one of the editor's picks.  They enjoy it and the graphics and sounds are fun too.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|the graphics are good but it just ends then you have to pay 3.99 for the full version so get it and if you like than its worth it
B00BESCUKK|5.0|Was one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time myself and my husband really enjoyed the movie.
B000002WPI|5.0|Pretty good my second favorite Wu Tang cd. Cream is my favorite followed by can it all be so simple.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|Beyoncé is the absolute best! The is probably the best selling cd she has ever had! I can listen to it from beginning to end with no problem.
B000002WYW|5.0|Greatest work by the Wu Tang Clan and it's affiliates. Love it. I've bought this double cd 3 times and it &#34;disappeared&#34; twice.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This third in the series continued the story from the first two books and never left me bored.  It was hard to put down!
0525478817|5.0|This is an absolutely precious story about a girl with cancer who finds love against all odds and stays through thick and thin. Real tearjerker throughout. As a young adult follower of John Green through his books and Youtube projects, I couldn't put this book down! Highly recommend to any young adult reader (great appeal to high schoolers) this and any other John Green novel.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|My son also did a tour to Ramadi and Afghanistan, so to read this book helps me to realize some of what he had and has to deal with. If you love America and love those that protect it, you won't be able to put this book down! Thank you Chris and thank you Taya!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The holder is great for smaller phones that are less than 4&#34;.<br /><br />The tripod doesn't really hold anything up but the holder has a universal tripod mount so you could get a bigger, better one and it would work just great.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|running this on an HTC incredible ii ... the controls really just don't work. there seem to have been similar issues (but gave it a try since this was the FAOTD). has lots of potential but it's too frustrating in its current state. for some reason there's no consistency in which way the fish moves when the phone is tilted in any direction - and that was just the 1st level. this is more than just a learning curve issue. I'd say save your money unless you're on a device that's been positively reviewed multiple times.
B0018RFLN0|3.0|There are lots of fancy special effects and explosions, but the story wasn't really very interesting. The acting was average.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you like to watch television shows about Parallel universes, crime and drama, then Fringe is for you.  You won't be dissappionted
B007IK44CK|4.0|This movie has an interesting plot and setting. The characters are more mature and better developed than in the previous Mission Impossible movie.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book. It kept my interest the whole way through. It made history come alive and wasn't afraid to show how ugly slavery could be.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie has a fascinating plot and great acting. The plot keeps the viewer attached to the movie from beginning to end.
B009GCF3Q4|4.0|These short stories were the reason I got into Connelly in the first place........ He gives every thing even short as these were depth and feeling.... With his unique twist.....
B00BESCJII|4.0|The film captures the time and experience well.  One of the best &#34;high school flicks&#34; in ages.  The soundtrack was an unexpected plus.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed Safe Haven and was happy with the ending!  It's nice to read when goodness prevails and love conquers all!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|It's a scavenger hunt. Pointless.  No sense.  Boring.  Waste of time.  Forget it.  Somebody phoned this one in.  No good.
B0015T6G2G|4.0|Through Mandela's autobiography, I have a much better feel for the people, tribes, religions and politics of South Africa. I am ready to go.
B000001DVD|5.0|Like most of Def Leppards songs and did not have this cd. it was a good addition to my collection.
034580404X|5.0|Looked brand new, in the box set with a plastic covering.  Smelled like real books and the books themselves were great.  Would by again.
B003B02O0U|5.0|I have read this book twice in the past 20 years and really enjoyed it both times..It may not be Grishams best but it is rock solid and rather action packed..
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it keeps freezing up. which causes me to run into trees or not be able to jump or turn. its not as good as the first one because of these problems.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Bought these songs and apps for my Kindle Fire before switching to the iPad.... Good stuff at the time though!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|and this dvd shows the best of the adaptations to the best possible advantage.  Too bad the original film was on 16&#34; film.  My 1920X1080 TV shows the slight loss of detail due to the small film.
B008B68IEA|5.0|I say great because the kids loved it. I have NO idea or opinion about the item, I do know that it was new and packaged perfectly!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I was expecting a great movie from the hype; however was disappointed by the acting and plot. The singing was great!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Funniest show in years. Able to get the first 4 seasons in one swoop at a great price. Must have!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book falls in the rubric of &#34;what if's&#34;??  To survive stranded alone on a planet with the possibility dying not only alone but in a most horrible manner keeps you hoping the astronaut is smarter than you.  If you've had some chemistry, botany, physics, etc<br />the story even becomes more rich and thought provoking.<br />I usually read the zombie or post-apocalyptic genres but am glad I ventured into this sci-fi novel.  I guarantee you'll love this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bought these songs and apps for my Kindle Fire before switching to the iPad.... Good stuff at the time though!<br /><br />Still love it on iPad!!
B007IK44CK|5.0|I enjoyed the fun, the humor and the action.  it is a great way to spend a rainy day inside.
B0061S073A|5.0|Great app on the Fire before switching to the iPad. The kids really enjoyed it and I never had any problems/issues!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Love it.  Better cover than I expected.  Great value for the price. Looks great.  Would highly recommend this cover to everyone.
B009K86D86|5.0|This is a must-watch.  It does not take a political statement about anything, just interviews lots of people.  It explains why there is e-coli in spinach so much.  Can't rave about it enough and I had to be dragged kicking & screaming to watch it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Can't stop playing it. Great physics and looks great on he he screen. Great time killer and gets vey challenging in the later levels
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Although it works just fine, I find I hold more often in my hand than on a stand so...when I use it, it's ideal.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|A fun funny movie for kids. My little brother enjoyed laughing through this movie and loves to watch it. 4 stars
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Any age evidently likes to play with these silly birds, so the free look at what everyone else was talking about made a dent in the mytique.  Also it offers enough variation to challenge you for a while.<br /><br />They are also kinda silly birds in that they don't always, even when you've progressed some, go where you want to you feel silly and they just look it.<br /><br />Have a go at a realitively non-violent game.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The drama that has boiled through all the films with these 3 friends finally comes to a climax. Not a bad movie but the only reason I can see that they made it is to give more definition to the characters before they ended it. 3 stars
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Best animated movie we've seen in awhile. Funny, great music, interesting storyline, and my two sons loved it! We will definitely be buying soon
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|I would recommend this to Resident Evil fans. It does not follow too closely to the games but has some similar scenes. Not a bad sequel, overall 4 stars.
B007SGM084|4.0|I have been very hesitant to read these books because I’m not into BDSM, and the reviews I’ve reads just plastered that was all this “Story Line” is about.  A friend told me there was a good plot to the stories and to give them a try.  Well I’m here to tell you boy do they have it “ALL WRONG”!!<br /><br />Very few authors can catch your attention in the beginning of their stories and keep it all the way through.  Well, I’m here to tell you E.L.James has very much done that for me. The emotional roller coaster that you experience is absolutely uncanny, something I love in storytelling.  Not only was I captured and pulled into her story, I found I couldn't wait to find out what is going to happen next.  If you love the thrill, excitement, passion, for the love of the game shall we say, you will love this miniseries.  It’s a read again for sure.  Well Done Mrs. James.
B005OK725M|5.0|Revenge never tasted so sweet but we owe all that to the wonderful acting of Zoe Saldana! A good movie for people who love action and revenge and sexy women! 5 stars
B004K58GSO|5.0|The Quintessential John Wayne Movie!  Its a classic! Gunfights, humor, bad guys, and John Wayne!!! What could be any better in a Western!
B004GJYROG|4.0|Michael Jordan and The Looney Toons? Whats not to like! A fun movie that the family can enjoy unless you are sensitive to a few things that you may not want to expose younger children to. 4 stars
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|Spoiler Alert! I hated this movie. The other negative reviewers here pretty much touched on everything I didn't like about the movie. I too found myself wondering why doesn't anyone turn on a light. Also made no sense that the entity haunted the family at one house only to wait to kill them in their other home. What weird switch was flipped there just because of a move from one building to another? There also was no inclination that the youngest child was being corrupted in anyway. If pictures were a portal, when did she see them? Most of the movie was spent showing grainy and graphic murder scenes on home movies. The wife was oblivious that she was living in a murder house. Really? With today's technology there's no way she couldn't have known about such a horrid thing unless she was living under a rock.<br /><br />All this I could've overlooked and would have had it not been for the ending of this movie. I really wanted to like this movie and it could've been really good. The story had so many other directions it could've taken but it stuck to what I figured was going to happen 2/3 of the way through. It could've been a creepy and intellectual thriller say had the villain turned out to be an actual serial killer or cult doing the murdering or even if had the local sheriff been in a little more on the sinister things going on than anyone realized. There were so many routes the plot could've gone. Instead it chose to have an entity hypnotize children to kill their families so the entity could then have the child for dinner. Thank you but no thank you. The ending made me sick. I find the idea of children murdering their own families then being eaten by some supernatural being sick not scary. I usually keep a movie on my DVR till it expires so that someone else can watch it before its gone. I deleted this as soon as the credits rolled. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It is fun to have a horse in the city where its impossible, just a great app jhighly suggest forany one who cant have wnimwls or lives them want them but r allergic... great job creaters.
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|The movie isn't by any means as good as its predecessor. However it was interesting enough to make me want to see the end. I feel like so much more could've been done with the film. There definitely could've been greater work done on storyline, character development and dare I say, monsters. The first movie had scarier scenes. This one just didn't scare me. Short and sweet the movie felt very rushed and just could've been better. There have been 9 Silent Hill video games. That's a lot of plot, creatures and characters to work with. I will admit if I had not seen the first movie I wouldn't have liked it what little bit I did. They talk about some of the events that took place in the first movie but it just felt lacking. Also with the 2D version I watched you could really tell this movie had been in 3D before. Those obvious scenes really stood out and didn't fit well. I was really excited to watch this but I was expecting it to be as good as the first and it wasn't. Either way the music was pretty good. I'm still waiting for a new horror movie to be 4 or at least 5 stars. There just haven't been any lately to meet that standard to me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome!!<br />I can't wait for the movie! Nicholas sparks is the best author ever! Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|We love these movies.  This was my youngest daughters reward for good grades.  It is what she picked!  Cute Movie.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book was amazing!:)<br />You did a good job.<br />What new books in stead the third wheel. Any new ones yet.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Although well-written, I found this book tedious to read and a bit far- fetched. Our book club members either didn't like it, or loved it and thought it would become a literary classic in the coming of age genre.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game hus wish it said free then get in to it and u have to pay but other then that fun game
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This one was hard to read and harder to put down.  I felt like I was getting too naked of a view, a far too intimate look into Camille's thoughts and faults, which is exactly what I loved about it.  I can't wait to read another one by Flynn.  She kept me guessing all the way through.  I'd give it six stars if I could.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|To be perfectly honest, this app scared the crap out of me. Tip: DO NOT TURN AROUND LIKE I DID!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My husband is constantly sharpening a variety of knives and this tool has come in handy.  It is small enough to fit in his pocket but he says it works very well.  Seems well made, too.  Smaller than I thought it would be, but it is easy to carry, I guess.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|New characters, new enemies. Hi-def. Enjoy the scenes.<br /><br />Seems easier to beat than another Angry Birds game I have.<br /><br />I recommend to everyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Was not expecting a lot of that but ended up being g very good<br />Will read more books by this author
B00122J0YW|5.0|Probably Madonna's best work. I wore out several cassttes back in 1986 when this came out and I am glad that it has been re-issued on digital media.<br />One downside is that when its on my mp3 player it comes up True Blue (Re-issue).
B0091VGAXK|4.0|My husband hates musicals and shows like Glee but he loved this movie. Growing up in the '80's made this movie really fun to watch.
076115678X|5.0|Best resource for curls ever. I have had this book for a couple years now. I still reference it at times, and I always recommend and lend it to other women just exploring their curly side.<br />I didn't go curly until my early 20's and then it took me another 5 years to accept it, and realize I needed help. Curly and straight are not the same, different down to the molecular level.<br />This book makes it simple and easy to find a starting place for managing your curls, and turning them into healthy, juicy curls. You can NOT GO WRONG with this book.
0385537816|5.0|Loved the covers. Especially seeing E.L. James on the back cover. Loved the books and will enjoy these as well
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Hard to believe such a small device can produce such volume. This is a really good amp and the price is ridiculously cheap
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Finally a great vamp series it's like Harry potter meets twilight meets true blood. It's not just a romance it has a ton of action. I've  read it a million times and I'll read it a million more. I <3 this book/series!
1574214276|4.0|Good for beginners. Basics and background info on the beginnings of Zentangle. Good reference for basic patterns. Shading tips are definitely for beginners -- too elemental for those of us who have drawing experience. Overall, worth having as a beginning reference.
B0086700CM|4.0|This would've gotten 5 stars if 2 hadn't been so much better than this version. There are a few features that I miss such as the invisibility power-up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show on television.  I enjoy it so very much.  Bring on Season 4!  I cannot wait to find out what happens next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2 and it can be VERY addicting. There are few features I miss from the 1st version, but this one more than makes up for it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very enjoyable show.  It is interesting and I cannot wait to see each episode.  The actors  are exceptional.  The characters they play are captivating.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this game, but come on where are other levels at? An app this popular needs to have regular updates to keep our interests.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Good movie.  I enjoy Sandra Bullock in almost anything.  I loved the scenery and the groom's family was delightful.  Thank you.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this version of Mahjong.  It's easy to play and I love the traditional look of the tiles. More tiles would be nice though.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Compared to many experiences with streaming netflix and vudu using the exact same isp and streaming device amazon provides a clearly inferior service.  Is there a different descriptive name we could come up with that means the opposite of streaming?  I'll have to think about that.  In the meantime this is the last time I will use Amazon streaming.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|If you like mahjong, this is a really nice version to play on  your tablet. We all  play at our house to pass time while waiting for appointments etc.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Slow and not very exciting.  I hope future Bond movies go back to the original theming for the series and exciting gadgets.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|It's very very good for running! I recommend for every person who wants to train and compete. Very good gps system.
B009KY0WCI|4.0|Most CDs could be categorized into three camps: 1) totally blows you away, 2) totally disappoints, or 3) somewhere in between. Fray's passion for Bach's music shows through, but the recording isn't &#34;perfect.&#34;<br /><br />The first plus is the virtuosity expressed in the faster movements. Fray's playing isn't just fast (as it should be in these examples), but there's a palpable passion and energy behind the phrasing that's good.<br /><br />Second, the recorded sound and acoustic is very nice.<br /><br />Some of the slower movements might be a tad &#34;bland&#34; in comparison to the faster ones; Having seen Fray play on YouTube in concert, I think the interpretation is fine, but his facial expressions and body movements help convey the Affekt of the music. On record alone, I might wish for &#34;more&#34; in terms of phrasing, tempo, or a more overt &#34;statement&#34; about the music.<br /><br />Lastly, there's audible noises from Fray (his foot, and what sounds like grunts). These are far from the vocalisations by Gould in his recordings, but nevertheless, it might be off-putting to some.<br /><br />In the end I enjoyed this recital and in a very short time have managed to listen to it often enough to recommend it. It is a nice companion to readings by others; I liked Andreas Staier on harpsichord and Hewitt's toccatas on piano.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It took about 10 mine to load on my kindle fire. The graphics are so real you feel like you are really part of the game. G5 another great one. Keep them coming.
B008NR8YXC|4.0|I have difficulty summing up what I felt about this highly-marketed release by Andras Schiff. It's honest and there's a consistent aesthetic point of view applied between each pair of preludes and fugues. This, for me, makes it a nice \\"reference recording,\\" one you can always come back to.<br /><br />An apt comparison is the set by Edward Aldwell; I think Schiff's is better. Compared to Jarrett's book 1 on ECM, this is much better. But I also like the idea of using Bach's music to inject a little creativity into the performance. Fredrich Gulda, therefore, is a favorite of mine on piano. Schiff's own nuances are far more subtle, but they are there, at least in enough of the performances.<br /><br />That's why I'd say they are, as as set, short of profound... instead they're honest, well-done, and well-captured.
B0017HEX76|4.0|This is a Korean knock-off version that has been edited to remove about 20 minutes of the talking content between the music selections.Good quality technically. For me the edits were fine since it's for my grandkids. Anyone looking for the original movie (with its Deems Taylor interviews explaining the music)  would not be happy.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I went to the movies with my fiance to see this.  He was very hesitant at first thinking it was going to be a movie about bread crumbs and a house made of candy.  However, this movie was far from being about bread crumbs!  It is a great movie, very action packed, and bloody.  It has a very good twist in it and is well worth watching!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It's so rare that you get an honest look at the German's side of the WWII story. It's really easy to vilify and malign all German soldiers as evil Nazis. To hear a story of honorable, good German soldiers who were unfortunately on the wrong side of history is refreshing. The central piece of this historical book is an incident where German pilot Franz Stigler escorted a severely damaged B-17 piloted by Charlie Brown through Germany's anti-aircraft defenses, permitting the Americans to return to Great Britain. However, most of the book focuses on Franz's story, leading up to and following this unusual and inspiring event. Definitely worth a read.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|the good songs are good. the others seem like Disney songs. maybe i should listen more. radioactive is by far the best. just get the single
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|He's done it again great book keep them coming. The Jack Ryan Charater is awesome and now with his som in the loop it can continue for a long while
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Fun game when being to fill time...wouldn't want to play when waiting in a Drs. Office or other quiet place. I tend to get into it and find myself making too much noise. But that's me...just saying...
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use to use cable internet, then I changed to Yahoo mail and liked it better. This way, if our cable changes, my email won't!
B008XG1X18|5.0|What's not to like? This app.is a must have for my tablet...when I'm away from my PC.It's so much better than trying to view it on my smart phone. Great fun to actually be able to see it and pin those favorite interest goodies for later.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think facebook is more fun chatting with everyone better then being on hold. (I myself is still trying to get use to it). Also hearing the news then hearing it through the vine.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This has been done before and I'm not a fan of it. I mean the whole Romeo and Juliet \\"we're so hopelessly in love let's just kill each other bc we can't live without each other\\" is gross and unoriginal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers for kindle fire hd is really good it's on a 7 inch screen and is really fun to play I recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|Very Slow.  The author drags the story out.  Could have been much shorter.  Also, predictable even though it was unrealistic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was kind of iffy about getting this game because of the price of 6.99<br />but after I played the pc version on my cousins server, I had to take the risk, and all I have to say is I'M SOOO HAPPY I DID and personally I kinda like it more than the pc version and a lot of people say that there are no monsters to fight and they are wrong when you make a world just click the thing that says creative.<br /><br />  HAVE FUN!!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Has lot's of choices, Have rouble relaxing some days...this is a great app with or without headphones.  Would recommend it!!!!
B009O2XY12|4.0|Bubble Mania was fun once I learned how to play the game!  I just started playing last night but I know it will be addicting!
B003IY48PS|1.0|Back in the early 80's I can understand this film creating a buzz. It is an over the top gore fest which probably pushed the envelope for it's time and made it a memorable experience. Practically the last half of the film is dedicated to shocking you with puss, gallons of blood, roaches and more blood flowing freely from the gouges of every demon extremity you can think of. The overall experience is a comical and gag inducing one which is undoubtedly intentioned. This is all fine and dandy but the film seemingly relies wholly on the viscera alone. Let's put it this way, the characters (spoiler) get possessed then become a bloody practical effects mess. This is all there is to the flick.    Absolution to logic is required to nearly all horror films but this one requires so much that the viewer loses interest into taking it seriously at all. Example, a woman is terrified and is left in a car with no motivation as to why her driver has left her behind. He didn't discover something (like in a Slasher film), he wasn't possessed (like in a Satanic film), he was simply...away, to provide a jump scare for the audience. The acting is notably bad...even for a horror film...in the 80's. The sacred Ash is the clear winner for worst actor in the film. For example when he is asked to hit one of the demons he stands there dazed not in a \\"I\\"m so horrified I'm frozen in place\\" way but rather \\"I\\"m hoping that Ripley will induct me as his newest model for the wax museum.\\"    I suspect that this film's success relies heavily on the fan-bases' memories from when they were more impressionable. I understand that it has no intention to be The Shining but for today most horror fans will request more meat to bite into instead of just the gristle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very good book with a good concept. I thought that it would be kind of gross with the killing part that they would make it disgusting, but they handled it very well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For NDE's.....this is the book to purchase...if you ever doubted for ONE SECOND, that there is NO HEAVEN....by the time you finish reading this Dr. Alexander will prove you wrong and NOT by anecdotal evidence....Dr. Alexander is the real deal.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It's getting very good, but only to find out that the next one won't be out until June. Very disappointed.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|Creative for sure but it seems like this is one of Terentio's B side movies.  Pass on this one as there are better movies out there.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|If you are a person of faith or one who simply does not appreciates onscreen nudity then you will probably do as I did and walk away from this movie when within the first 5 minutes a woman appears completely naked sporting her entire vagina n breast. I had hope for better from a movie staring Danzel.
B0086700CM|4.0|The adage that you get what you pay for springs to mind.  Works alright on my Motorola Droid X.  Graphics and game speed seem to be reasonable for what it is.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|FITS MY KINDLE FIRE HD 7\\" WELL. I LIKE IT A LOT.  MY CAT HAS PUSHED IT OFF THE TABLE AND BED SEVERAL TIMES AND IT HAS BEEN WELL PROTECTED.  IT LOOKS VERY NICE - MINE IS DARK PINK. I DO APPRECIATE THE CHOICES OF COLORS TWO OF THE INSIDE TABS HAVE WORN WHERE I SLIDE IT OUT TO OBTAIN ANGLED VIEWING WHILE SITTING UPRIGHT.  THE LEATHER IS JUST NOT POLISHED, BUT MORE OF A PINK SWEDE ON THE TIPS  WHICH REALLY DOESN'T DETRACT FROM THE LOOK OF THE CASE. IT DOES SMELL A LITTLE WHEN I WATCH A MOVIE OR READ A BOOK - I HAVE THE LEATHER CASE - BUT MY KINDLE HAS NEVER OVERHEATED SO ALL IS WELL. I CHOSE THE LEATHER THINKING IT WOULD BREATHE BETTER THAN PLASTIC AND THEREFORE MY DEVICE WOULD NOT OVERHEAT SO READILY. I DO READ FOR HOURS AT TIMES.  ALL THE HOLES ARE PROPERLY FITTED AND I LIKE THAT IT TURNS ON AND OFF AS I OPEN AND CLOSE THE CASE.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE ON AND OFF SWITCH ON MY OWN AND THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE.  I HAVE LOOKED AT SEVERAL CASES WHICH WERE PRICED 25 - 50% MORE THAN THIS ONE AND THIS CASE BY FAR HAS BETTER FEATURES. IT IS SLIM BUT DOES PROTECT MY DEVICE. IT IS CONSTRUCTED WELL AND HAS MUCH BETTER ANGLES AND STRAPS TO PUT YOUR HANDS IN IF ONE IS SO INCLINED. IT HOLDS THE DEVICE STURDILY IN MANY POSITIONS.  IT ALSO HAS A PLACE FOR A STYLUS THAT IS UNOBTRUSIVE.  THE MOST BOTHERSOME THING IS THAT WHEN I RECHARGE OR PLUG IN THE HDMI CABLE TO MY KINDLE THE COVER CAN NOT BE MOVED UNLESS THE CORDS ARE UNPLUGGED TO REPOSITION IT.  AS OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED BEFORE ME, I BELIEVE THIS IS AN AMAZON DESIGN FLAW AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE ITSELF.  PLACING THE HINGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WOULD MEAN THE CAMERA LENS WOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN OVERLOOKING THE CASE WHICH WOULD BE UNDESIRABLE.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am enjoying learning to use my new Kendil Fire and the additional tools have helped me enjoy learning to use it. I will recommend this to more of my friends.<br />As seniors we all need to keep  learning and the tools really help.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|The third movie in the Evil Dead series. This series goes from fright to funny with our hero Ash ( the chainsaw armed double barrel shotgun toting demon slayer) who has been teleported into the past to battle evil. Of course he messes thing up for the locals while trying to get back to future via the book of necronamica (the book of the dead). So he can either split the scene & let the people fend for themselves or stay and fight the Army of Darkness he has unleashed. This DVD shipped on time & in good condition.
079284131X|5.0|I bought a 4 pack of Chucky movies that for some reason didnt have the first one?????? So I ordered this one off Amazon to complete the collection. I like the original story line about a murderous criminal who gets his soul transfered into a &#34;Good Guys&#34; doll. Some of the murder scenes get pretty graphic & the language is explicit too, so I wouldnt watch it with the kids. This DVD shipped on time &In good condition.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|At first I thought the Harry Potter movies were lame ( before I even watched them). But once I started to watch them with my kids (like I wind up doing with all the movies my kids have) I really started to enjoy watching them. I have to admit that I have become a fan of all the Harry Potter movies. I have one more to complete the entire series. This DVD shipped on time & in good condition.
B001C08RHA|5.0|We got this movie for our oldest son & became a family favorite. Some of the content gets pushed pretty far but the movie is awesome & would highly recommend for any super hero collection. This DVD shiped on time & good condition.
B001EBYM62|5.0|It's fun, it's quotable, it has catchy tunes, it's funny, and has great characters.  Did I mention my kids love it?
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is definately a great bag if you have multiple lenses and a camera body and just starting off with you photography. There are way better bags out there but you will be needing to drop a lot more $$$. I am almost 100% happy with this bag, the only thing that really bummed me out was the fact the top handle ripped off with in a week. Other than that, great bag
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game like the challenge, play it all the time,like the different levels and the opportunity to beat your own score
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a totally absorbing theatrical production. AAA+++. Once you get started, you have to keep watching and watching and watching!
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie, but there wasnt much to it, unfortunately. Willis and J-G-L were good, but not good enough to save the overall story.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.I felt it was well orchestrated.Alot of good actors here.I especially enjoy movies where there are several well-known actors,and several different plots.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|In as far as it took me, it was an excellent help. A little info going further would be *****
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a good &#34;vegging&#34; book.  Read the book and don't bother with the movie.  It is good to see such high standards.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|i like that you can just use a stylus on it instead of typing everything. i hate typing these notes in school so im glad i found this
B00AERRKHA|5.0|Any fan of her previous VOR books will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Great to get the 'Ivan Vorpatril' perspective on life as well.<br /><br />A very enjoyable and fun read but for me it ended just a bit too quickly... more more more. please.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a fast read.  I got very involved with the characters.  I always wanted to know what was happening next.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Another great look at the educational system from Paul Tough. He provides a nice summary of research into grit and optimism and how it can effect growing children.
0802473164|4.0|A very simple and easy book to read. I would highly recommend this book to any man, whether you have a stable or not so stable relationship.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Once you pop, you can't stop. This is a highly addictive game, and you can waste many an hour trying to get through the multiple levels. Fun and simple game.
B00A757EFW|4.0|i liked this app. Obviously the small screen leaves something to the imagination, but all in all it was a well developed version of the classic arcade game
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Didn't like this app at all. The game play was not fun and I deleted it from my phone the same day that I downloaded it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is so awesome because it never gets old because there is so many new things to do every day.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Kids watch this movie over and over and over. They also act out the scenes as &#34;play&#34;. May not be appropriate for their ages due to language and violence but they love it anyway.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I really only needed the larger of the two, but glad i got both just in case someday i need the smaller one. Very easy to use.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|It was very informative, and did'nt realize how some food you eat is not healthy for you. It defintely helped me.
B000AP04NI|5.0|is there anything not to love about a classic rogers and hammerstien?  maybe a dream sequence here or there.  everything else makes up for it though.  love this classic musical movie.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|It wasn't as good as the originals the originals will always stay the best I would wait to get this for 99 cents 2 99 is not worth it
B00867GHS8|5.0|The 3D in this movie is incredible. The blu-ray itself is also fantastic. This is my son's favorite movie so we had to own it on blu-ray even though we already had it in DVD format. I am so glad I purchased it.
B000W1MEFG|5.0|This album is an enduring classic from one of the greatest jazz vocalists and one of the top tenor men of all time. Every track is a winner, but I especially enjoy &#34;Lush Life.&#34;
0316228532|2.0|Even with the forewarnings that J.K. Rowling had written a book for her now grown-up readers, not for the children they once were, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is a huge disappointment.  The characters are mean, vindictive, wife- and child beaters; the book is filled with drugs and teenage sex, all of which add little to the story -- but in fact become the story.<br /><br />The wonderful creativity Rowling showed in her Harry Potter books disappears into a morass of dirt that surrounds the election of what in the U.S. would be a town council; the characters are one-dimensional; the happenings simply do not seem true.  There is nothing to recommend this book.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am so addicted to pll I usually buy the seasons on DVD but I couldn't wait so I bought a few and kept buying more beware !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie but the book definitely blew the movie out of the water and I'll be reading the next two.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Loved this game on my cell, it's even better on my kindle!! Great graphics, good sound, easy user interface and super fun to play.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|This 2013 reissue of \\"Rumors\\" has two extra discs, one of live performances from the Rumors tour (places and dates not specified) and a third of out-takes and demos.  I wasn't all that interested in the third, but I thought the original had been well-remastered (at least it sounds fine on my equipment) and the \\"live\\" disc was very good.  In fact, I enjoyed the energy on the live disc even more than the studio stuff, although the sound isn't quite as refined.  I had been listening to earlier Mac albums, pre-Stevie and Lindsay, and it's striking how much more confident a singer and performer Christine  MacVie is in this later album (and live).  Stevie and Lindsay added the star-power and songwriting skills to turn this ex-blues band into a pop sensation.  Gains and losses in the transformation, but you can't deny it's catchy!  Synergy's a funny thing -- neither Lindsay nor Stevie on their respective subsequent solo efforts could quite match their success with Mac.  Fervent Nicksians will disagree -- but her solo discs seems precious and over-produced to me.
0446580848|2.0|The last hundred or so pages are vintage DeMille.  They're the kind of writing that gained him fans early on.<br /><br />The 500-odd pages before that could easily have been trimmed to half, or less.  In fact, in the first 200 pages, essentially nothing happens.<br /><br />This is another Corey and Kate story.  For those who don't know, John Corey is a wisecracking retired NYC cop, now working for an anti-terrorist task force in New York.  His wife, Kate, is an FBI agent seconded to the same task force.  In this and previous adventures, they hunt down terrorists.  In The Panther, their target is an American-born jihadist who was responsible for the attack on the USS Cole and who now runs al-Qaeda in Yemen.  Corey and Kate participate in a CIA operation to find and capture (or kill) the bad guy.<br /><br />This could have been a fine story.  DeMille's descriptions of Yemen are very good.  The plot twists are also good, if somewhat predictable.  The climax is exciting.<br /><br />But DeMille way overdoes Corey's wisecracking, to the point that it constantly kills tension.  His cliffhangers at the end of each short chapter are repetitious and do little to make you want to turn the page.  In fact, there's so much repetition in the story that removing it would have cut at least 200 pages.  As a reader I kept thinking, \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you've already said that twenty times -- or fifty times.  Get on with the story.\\"<br /><br />Corey's wife Kate, a good character in some of DeMille's earlier books, contributes almost nothing to this story.  Another character gets injured early on in Yemen, and much is made of whether this will compromise everyone else's ability to survive.  In the end, the subject is just dropped.  I could go on but won't.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Nelson DeMille.  I have most, if not all, of his books.  And I will buy his next one, in hopes that he regains his previous storytelling acumen.  But The Panther is a dud.
B00A4AI0AS|4.0|This six disc set is an amazing bargain, but just know that Klemperer is a bit of an acquired taste.  About 35 years ago, I bought his Beethoven Violin Concerto with Menuhin, and I didn't like it -- and I still wouldn't call it my first choice -- but age has brought wisdom (!), and I'm glad to reacquaint myself with it here.  In general, expect massive sound, with the lower strings and winds getting their full due in the sound picture, but it's a warm sound (the remastering has been well done, most of it in the 1990's), and here's the paradox -- with the weight of sound and the generally steady tempi there is no lack of liveliness and energy, and that's because of Klemperer's attention to the rhythmic life of what he's conducting.  The Menuhin that sounded stodgy and scratchy to my younger ears still has its scratchy moments (Menuhin's fault, not Klemperer's), but I've come to appreciate the pacing and the phrasing -- there's much that's lovely here, and throughout, Menuhin's interactions with the New Philharmonia winds is something special.  Indeed the wind-playing throughout this boxed set is outstanding.  The Mozart Horn Concertos lack the spring of Karajan/Brain, but the sound here is better, and Civil is just superb too.  The Barenboim versions of the Piano Concertos, again, wouldn't be my first choice if I had to buy only one set (that would be Perahia/Haitink), but these are strong performances.  In the First concerto, for instance, Barenboim and Klemperer give us upfront and strongly played accounts of the first two movements (I'ld like a little more light and shade from the piano), but in the third movement, initiated by the piano, Barenboim (24 then to Klemperer's 80+) hits just the right tempo for the allegro scherzando -- and Klemperer takes him up on it.  It's a great account of that movement, and it shows that weight, wit, and spryness CAN go together.  In other music, there's Oistrakh's fine Brahms Violin Concerto (with the orchestra of French radio) and Liszt and Schumann from the under-appreciated Annie Fischer.  So -- forget period performance, get a glass of good red wine, and settle in.and Liszt and Schumann from the under-appreciated Annie Fischer.

B004AYCWZI|4.0|This is a book for foodies, but also an engaging story about striving to succeed in a new land. The protagonist is an Indian boy whose family moves to rural France to open an Indian restaurant. The boy has an exceptional sense of taste and a seemingly inborn sense for combining ingredients. As he matures he becomes increasingly adept at French cooking, and his relationships with his family and the \\"natives\\" of his adopted land mature in the process.<br /><br />There's humor and pathos and plenty of behind-the-scenes insight into what it takes to prepare meals that keep customers coming back. I recommend it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Finally a Clancy book in par with the old excellent books like hnt for red october, clear and present danger, etc
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This is 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. I cannot relate to any of this at all. There is nothing good about children getting molested, look what it has done for our tyrannical President. There is nothing good about being homosexual. Most rational people will reject every idea in this book/movie. Don't waste even one second reading this or watching the movie, you will be a lesser person for having done so.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|more adolescent angst than a real look at depression or mental health. but, entertaining,and uplifting. well produced and performed. definitely light, but entertainment that perks you up a bit

B0076DELIG|2.0|This book was a big disappointment for me .As i began reading it i kept waiting for the plot to take off. I was afraid the plot was given away early in the book and after reading seventy percent of the book my fears were realized.Finally after reading three chapters of fill as the main character rides around  central California the story  began to fulfill what I had anticipated at the beginning of the book .I felt this book was a waste of my time and I honestly can not understand the good reviews it received by others.
B005BCE7II|4.0|I bought all the movies to watch with my grandkids but found out that maybe they aren't suitable for them yet because some of the violence might upset them.  Other than that I really enjoyed the movie and the characters.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel's character was so convincing and realistic, I found myself disliking him.  The special effects were very good.  I can always tell when a movie meets my expectations when I can look back on it several days later and remember the movie in great detail and want to see it again.

You must lay the backpack flat on the table to open it up to avoid any of the equipment falling out.  I would like it even better if it came with more than two velcro fasteners to hold more of the items in place.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm a big behind on this series but saw an episode and liked it enough to catch up. Great writing, great style !!  It's not HOUSE but its close :)

B0037QM8YA|3.0|the story left too many questions; precious, her mother, her father all very dark skinned, where did she get a light skinned baby with what's called &#34;good hair&#34;?  movie showed too much of her abuse and not enough of how she climbed up to her eventual freedom.  Why was the father only shown when he abused her and then &#34;poof&#34; no more daddy.  Also, there was waaaaayyyyyy to much vulgarity.  Monique did a great job with her character at the end of the movie - long way from &#34;hey professor ogelvie.&#34;  She really portrayed so much of what is seen today, women choosing men over their children.  Her character finaly realized what she'd given up, but it was too late.  Unfortunately,. some women never realize.  How sad,
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I love English literature and I feel as though this screenplay adaptation let some of the characters down by changing stories about their demeanor, changing dialogue and story lines where it did not need to be changed. It always disappoints me when this happens to great literature.  If the screenplay writer wanted a different story, they should have written their own. I'll provide some examples without trying to give too much away.<br /><br />Thornton was portrayed as more severe than he was.  His entire introduction to the story was completely changed and thus ruined some of the appeal.  Higgins wasn't as rough around the edges as he should have been and Mary was portrayed brilliantly but a little more educated than a person of her class would have been.  Mr. Hall's exit from the story line was appalling and made me want to throw the book at the writer(s) and tell they disrespected one of the best English authors of all time by the changes they made.<br /><br />I have a feeling Ms. Gaskell would have hated this movie.  Not for the production (it was the brilliant part of this series) but for the way the story portrayed some powerful characters and the extra weakness it provided to others (Margaret's mother, for one).  There were missed opportunities with dialogue and I would be remiss if I weren't honest about it.<br /><br />This is an example of what happens when horrible writing (re-telling) happens to a superb production and when one feels they can abuse good literature for the sake of their own story telling.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I had gotten a free download of \\"Where I Sleep\\" about 6 months ago and really never listened to it.  I was deleting some songs from my library, ran across it and thought I should listen to it before I removed it.  I am glad I did.  This woman is amazing.  I read an earlier review where someone stated they normally liked their R&B singers with more of a powerhouse voice.  I get that but to be honest that is exactly what I like about Emeli Sande'.  She is not that way.  She has such a great voice that pushing too hard would surely mask the tone, emotion and subtlety her voice can convey.  I decided to buy the whole album and have not been disapointed.  From beginning to end this disc is great.  At the $3.99 price that I paid I almost feel I am ripping Ms. Sande' off.  If I were being fair I would send $10.00 to her personally along with a thank you note for sharing her obvious talent with the world.  Anyway I highly reccomend this disc.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The original P4 on the PS2 was an all time classic. Golden has enormous amounts of new and interesting content added. The only negative I experienced was the new VA for Chie. I much prefer the original VA. If you are on the fence, do it. Buy this game! :)

A lot of the tracks sound the same or similar but it's different and upbeat. There's a little too much auto-tuning going on in a couple of the tracks as well.

081297381X|5.0|The polemicist Simon Foucher warned that, “we are dogma-prone from our mother’s wombs.”  Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s philosophical work, The Black Swan, is truly a masterpiece that addresses this problem.  At one point in the book, Taleb asserts that “the ultimate test of whether you like an author is if you’ve reread him”.  Considering the fact that I’ve now read this book twice, it’s fair to say that I greatly admire Taleb’s work.  Now on to the review.<br /><br />***<br /><br />In “Part 1″, there is an interesting anecdote, that sets the tone for the rest of the book, about Umberto Eco’s library.  Eco is a highly respected semiotician, essayist, philosopher, literary critic, and novelist.  And he owns a library that reportedly contains over 30,000 books.  He isn’t, however, known for being boastful about it.  When guests come over to his house he usually gets one of two reactions.  The vast majority of guests, according to Taleb, respond with something similar to the following “Wow!  Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have!  How many of these books have you read?”  And then there are the people who get the point:  “A large personal library is not an ego-boosting appendage, but a research tool.”  The point of this story emphasizes a critical theme throughout the book, i.e., we overemphasize what we think we know and downplay how ignorant we really are.  An antilibrary (representing things we don’t know) is more valuable to us than are the books we’ve already read (or things we already know).<br /><br />Early on we also learn that Taleb classifies himself as a skeptical empiricist.  And, you may be wondering, what exactly is a skeptical empiricist?  “Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.”<br /><br />For further clarification, empiricism is a theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge can only be ascertained exclusively via sensory experience.  And skepticism, it’s important to note, comes in many different varieties.  Taleb traces his skepticism back to its roots in the Pyrrhonian tradition.  However, he is also fond of “Sextus the (Alas) Empirical” (better known as Sextus Empiricus) and David Hume.  Taleb, however, is not entirely devoted to promoting rampant philosophical skepticism.  He simply wants to be “a practitioner whose principal aim is to not  be a sucker in things that matter, period.”<br /><br />Largely, then, this book is about epistemology, also known as the study of human knowledge.  What can we truly know?  And what are the limits of human knowledge?  I think Taleb focuses one of the fundamental problems of philosophy, which the German Philosopher, Immanuel Kant, also wrote extensively about (although from a different perspective), i.e., what are the limits of our reason?  Kant realized that examining human reason is inherently problematic, namely because when humans try to examine metaphysical or even epistemological issues we can never do so outside the bounds of our own reasoning ability.  We’re suckers, blinded to reality, because we are trapped in our own human minds!<br /><br />Throughout the book, Taleb picks on the great thinker of antiquity, Plato.  Taleb, however, also gives the impression that he is quite fond of the great philosopher too, despite his shortcomings.  What Taleb calls Platonicity is the obsessive focus on the pure and well-defined aspects of reality, while ignoring the messier parts and less tractable structure that exist in reality.  Perhaps an example of Platonicity might help clear up this distinction.  A Platonified economist, for example, thinks that he can accurately model something as complex as the macroeconomy.  Using foolish assumptions, the Platonified economist tries to assume conditions of reality (that don’t really exist) in order to fit her model rather than accepting that reality is far messier than the model.  One who is a Platonic thinker, then, could also be classified as a nerd.  Nerds, according to Taleb, believe that what cannot be Platonized and formally studied doesn’t exist, or isn’t worth considering.<br /><br />One interesting example of Platonicity provided in the book pertains to breast milk.  At one point in time, Platonified scientists believed that they had created a formula for a mother’s “milk” that was perfectly identical to a mother’s real milk.  Alas, they could then manufacture this milk in a laboratory and make financial gains from it!  Despite what appeared to be an identical chemical composition, there was empirical evidence showing increases in various cancers and other health problems in children who drank this fake-milk.  Was this a coincidence?  Perhaps.  But it also could be that the Platonified scientific formula for milk was missing some crucial element of the milk that we cannot see!<br /><br />Platoncitity can further be generalized as follows, “it is our tendency to mistake the map for the territory, to focus on well and pure defined “forms,” whether objects, like triangles, or social notions, like utopias (societies built according to some blueprint of what “makes sense”), even nationalities. “  In other words, a Platonified nerd is someone who visits New York City, but has with a map of San Francisco with them, and yet still thinks that their incorrect map will somehow help them.  Taleb believes that we have a built-in tendency to trust our maps, even when they’re for the wrong location. Furthermore, we fail to realize that no map is often better than the wrong map.<br /><br />The trouble is, according to Taleb, that we encourage nerd knowledge over other forms of knowledge, especially in academia.  Nerds focus on what fits in the box, even if the most important things in life fall outside the box.  The nerd simply neglects the antilibrary.<br /><br />At one point in history it was considered “knowledge” that all swans are white.  This was stated as a scientific fact because no black swans had ever been observed.  However, this line of reasoning presents an interesting philosophical problem, i.e., “The Problem of Induction“.  And the great philosopher, David Hume, wrote in great detail about this problem, although he wasn’t the first to do so.<br /><br />In order to further understand this problem let’s consider the following classic inference that led to the problem: All swans we have seen are white, and therefore all swans are white.  The problem is that even the observation of a billion white swans does not make that statement unequivocally true.  This is because black swans may exist, we just haven’t observed one yet.  We have obviously since discovered that black swans do indeed exist.  What can we learn here?  An over reliance on our observations can lead us astray.<br /><br />Still confused?  Then, let’s consider what we can we learn from a turkey, which hopefully provides further clarification.  The uberphilsopher Bertrand Russell illustrated this turkey example quite well.<br /><br />Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving it will incur a revision of belief.<br /><br />Taleb, then, states, “The turkey problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck.” Probably the most important point to note from the turkey is that our perceived knowledge from learning backwards may not just be worthless, but rather, it may actually be creating negative value by blinding us to future events with dire consequences.<br /><br/>As such, it’s certainly important to note that a series of corroborative facts is not necessarily evidence.  But where does that leave us in terms of how we can know things?  Well, Taleb further argues that we can know things that are wrong, but not necessarily correct (think Karl Popper’s falsifiability).  This he calls negative empiricism.  The sight of one black swan, then, can certify that not all swans are white, but the observation of a trillion white swans doesn’t give us any certifiable claims.<br /><br />Strangely, however, we humans have a tendency to ignore the possibility of silent evidence and look to confirm our theories, rather than challenge them.<br /><br />One of the central tenets of the book is the distinction between “Mediocristan” and “Extremistan”, which are terms for different types of domains.. When you’re dealing with a domain that’s in Mediocristan, then your data will fit a Gaussian distribution (a bell curve). In Extremistan, however, you’re not dealing with data that is normally distributed. A single observation in Extremistan can have an incredible impact on the total. Think of the following example. If we took the average height of a million humans and then, say, added the tallest person in the world to the sample, the average wouldn’t be affected in a significant way. Height is normally distributed. Now imagine we did the same thing with wealth. Adding the richest person in the world to a sample of a million people would greatly affect the average. The distribution of height, then, falls within the domain of Mediocristan and things like wealth in Extremistan.<br /><br />One of Taleb’s main points is that we often try to use the model that works in Mediocristan in Extremistan.  Taleb states, however, that almost all social matters belong to Extremistan and that the casino is the only human venture where probabilities are known and almost computable.  But even casinos aren’t immune to Extremistan — think about it.<br /><br />Another interesting concept from the book is the “toxicity of knowledge.” Too much information can be toxic especially when it inflates the confidence in an “expert” prediction. More information is not always better; more is sometimes better, but not always. And we often blindly listen to experts in fields where there can be no experts.<br /><br />If you follow Taleb’s argument, then reading the newspaper may actually decrease, rather than increase, your knowledge of the world. The Black Swan, however, will not only increase your understanding of the world, but it will make you wiser as well. For that reason, I can assure you that I will be rereading this book yet again at some point in the future.d simply neglects the antilibrary.<br /><br />At one point in history it was considered “knowledge” that all swans are white.

On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving it will incur a revision of belief.<br /><br />Taleb, then, states, “The turkey problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck.” Probably the most important point to note from the turkey is that our perceived knowledge from learning backwards may not just be worthless, but rather, it may actually be creating negative value by blinding us to future events with dire consequences.<br /><br/>As such, it’s certainly important to note that a series of corroborative facts is not necessarily evidence.  But where does that leave us in terms of how we can know things?  Well, Taleb further argues that we can know things that are wrong, but not necessarily correct (think Karl Popper’s falsifiability).  This he calls negative empiricism.  The sight of one black swan, then, can certify that not all swans are white, but the observation of a trillion white swans doesn’t give us any certifiable claims.<br /><br />Strangely, however, we humans have a tendency to ignore the possibility of silent evidence and look to confirm our theories, rather than challenge them.<br /><br />One of the central tenets of the book is the distinction between “Mediocristan” and “Extremistan”, which are terms for different types of domains.. When you’re dealing with a domain that’s in Mediocristan, then your data will fit a Gaussian distribution (a bell curve). In Extremistan, however, you’re not dealing with data that is normally distributed. A single observation in Extremistan can have an incredible impact on the total. Think of the following example. If we took the average height of a million humans and then, say, added the tallest person in the world to the sample, the average wouldn’t be affected in a significant way. Height is normally distributed. Now imagine we did the same thing with wealth. Adding the richest person in the world to a sample of a million people would greatly affect the average. The distribution of height, then, falls within the domain of Mediocristan and things like wealth in Extremistan.<br /><br />One of Taleb’s main points is that we often try to use the model that works in Mediocristan in Extremistan.  Taleb states, however, that almost all social matters belong to Extremistan and that the casino is the only human venture where probabilities are known and almost computable.  But even casinos aren’t immune to Extremistan — thinkabout it.<br /><br />Another interesting concept from the book is the “toxicity of knowledge.” Too much information can be toxic especially when it inflates the confidence in an “expert” prediction. More information is not always better; more is sometimes better, but not always. And we often blindly listen to experts in fields where there can be no experts.<br /><br />If you follow Taleb’s argument, then reading the newspaper may actually decrease, rather than increase, your knowledge of the world. The Black Swan, however, will not only increase your understanding of the world, but it will make you wiser as well. For that reason, I can assure you that I will be rereading this book yet again at some point in the future.

B0063IH60K|1.0|Between each game was a pop up advertisement.  This interupted and ruined the fun of the games, so I deleted Solitaire.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A Great second book in a fantastic trilogy, could hardly put this down and when I did finish is couldnt wait to start the third one
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Basic story was good and showed ability to trust. Details, however were very accurate and probably too detailed for a typical abusive past.  Anyone with an abusive past will probably want to skip this or risk nighmares.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|What a fantastic book to end what has been a fabulous journey with Lisbeth.  This triology has got to be one of the best reads I've had in years.  Couldn't wait to read the second and third after the first one and turned the last pages of the final book very slowly as I just didnt want the journey to end!.  Fabulous and worthy of all the good reviews it has received thus far. enjoy
B00AMBMF1Y|4.0|I was surprised how well this turned out. It's well filmed, well directed, and the principals did a great job of acting and bringing depth to their characters.<br />Mr. Eastwood was indeed iconic.... all us who worked on set found him inspiring.<br />While you won't see me in it, my Chevy Silverado is parked outside The Grey Squirrel Motel.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|The first sound track of the movie saga is the best, could listen to it all day but still love all the CD's for the movies this is just the favorite!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Mr. Washington delivers a masterful performance. The first half of the film is riveting.<br />I was booked to act in the cabin crash scene, but was bumped at the last minute, and moved to the NTSB hearing.<br />It's always interesting to see how a film comes together. The hearing sequence when Washington's character confesses his addiction was relatively dull when it was actually shot, but Mr. Zemeckis' directing and excellent post-production work resulted high drama.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest books I have ever read. I read this book in two days. Mark Owen knows how to tell a story and keep his readers captivated. I enjoyed the book so much in fact,  I read it a second time. I loved how he didn't leave any detail out, with his heart stopping description of the helicopter crash, you almost felt like you were right there with them. I highly recommend this book for yourself or for the avid reader in your life. It will not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game pretty fun to play great time killer. Does he a little repetitive. It is very hard to put down
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|If you enjoy computer generated mayhem, fine.  Otherwise this film has nothing to recommend it.  Watch the original Stallone version instead.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Had missed the first 2 seasons and so started to watch on Amazon, found myself and husband totally absorbed in the series, we love it! Now watching the 3rd season and don't want to finish and yet can't wait to watch last episode, hear its a shocker. Can't wait for season 4
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Fast-moving film with excellent acting by Liam Neeson; about a REAL problem in this world of mistreating young women by kidnapping them, drugging them and making them sex slaves.  Shocking!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|So much has been written. What more can be said characters scenery the stories....all wonderful too bad BBC gets it first
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I know and love Tarantino's style, many many of his movies are good.  And then there are a number that just don't get off the ground.  This movie is a prime example of that.  The RZA was just awful as the man with the iron fists, he was a craftsmen who had a pair of iron arms stuck onto his body and he fights like one.  Nothing about him says, it makes sense why I can keep up with these other bad mother's just by lugging a couple of arms that for all their &#34;part of him and alive&#34; theme, are just chunks of metal.  Coupled with the fact that other than enjoying girls and opium, Russel Crowe did almost nothing whatsoever.  Same with Lucy Liu and who the hell cares what the Lion boys were doing.  And Bronze Man went nowhere as well, a cool guy, killer with super power who loves kids and somehow those kids affection and loyalty shifts to Russel Crowe?  Nope, sorry, goodbye.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Story line was real to life situations.  We hear about abuse and don't really have a clue unless we have lived and survived the same type of situations.  Highly recommend for an interesting book to read.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Ultraviolet redemption code is missing from the box. Packaging is beautiful, and a great price, but the product title says Blu-ray/DVD Combo + *Digital Copy*. I'm not getting the full product. How can I get the redemption code if there was no insert in the DVD sleeve?
B000JLSM00|5.0|The sound and colors of this production were mastered wonderfully.  Looks like a newer film.  Can watch if over and over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this is a decent mystery - the wife's thinking process is interesting but the husband's role is a little too contrived
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|This isn't your tacky guts and gruesome film.  It's more of a learning lesson of &#34;what goes around/comes around.&#34;  Normal everyday people combined by fate in an elevator-all sinners which have an encounter with the devil himself.  Well done.  Pay attention to the characters backgrounds-everything fits in the end.  Enjoy.  Highly recommend this film.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|good stuff. well worth the coin and time. enjoyable with nice graphics. does take a bit of time to load and can't adjust volume but that's the only real problem.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I love these set of workouts. They are short (around 25 min) and after you are done it feels like you have been working out much longer. I love Jillian and the fact that she explains why we are doing each of the workouts.<br />After a couple of days I can feel my body has changed and became stronger and I don't struggle with the moves as I did in the first days!!<br />So for those that just started don't give up and try doing it almost everyday and after a week you can feel the difference.<br />I love the DVDs so much that I am thinking of getting her other DVDs. Any suggestions??
B002RL7W9W|5.0|My son and grandson absolutely love Star Wars.  You can't go wrong buying this set or any other set.  Great price for a great toy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Could Julian Fellows write it any better?  Could the actors act it any better? This is brilliant stuff.  The only thing wrong with it is that it's addictive!  My husband & I own all 3 series (I have it on DVD and on my Kindle) and were hooked after Episode 1 of Season 1.  Are there support groups for this?  Looking forward to Season 4!
B004478GN8|5.0|My son and grandson absolutely love Star Wars.  You can't go wrong buying this set or any other set.  Great price for a great toy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Probably for a younger reader than myself.  I have to admit that I prefer non-fiction but had heard a lot about this book so wanted to read it.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Some of the characters were funny, and most of the humor was funny to both adults and kids.<br />Would watch again
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Well obviously you must love the Beatles if you purchase this CD.  A good selection of hits and a great addition to my music library.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper is one of my all time favorite movies! I know its geered towards children; however I just can't get over the cleverness of the movie.And I absolutely love the song &#34;Remember me this way&#34; I feel so bad for Casper who really likes Kat a lot!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I don't think it was one of Flynn's best but it was still a page turner and satisfied the need to continue the journey.
B004J64QR4|5.0|I went and saw the movie Les Miserables in Theaters; that was the first time I saw anything related to Les Mis and it was awesome! So I came home and googled Les Mis and found this watched it! Loved it! Just hd to buy this.The man who plays Jevert is wonderfully talented! All the songs are very good.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|To me The Racketeer represents yet another great read by a great author.  This is my seventh John Grishum book and I have not been disappointed by any of them. John Grishum is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors and I would recommend his writing to every one I know. I'm looking forward to reading more of his works.  Thrilling to the very end.
B00632HWOG|3.0|This is the new version of Yahoo mail and it has glitches. Sometimes it deletes sometimes not. Sometimes it skips in reading a message sometimes not. Sometimes you click on an email and it erases it when you just wanted to open.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice graphics, good for all ages, wish to see other related games and hope to see new adventure´s for the surf crew.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Better than the movie. I highly recommend it! Victor Hugo would be proud, I wish I had written it. Who doesn't?
1451695195|5.0|At some point we all think of NDE (near death experiences.)  This book authenticates it to a new level and provides a stronger connection to those who have gone before us.  It provides hope that they are still there in some way although that is not the main theme of this book.  It allows us to think that maybe we are being looked over by someone up there.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw Les Mis on Broadway and I have to say that this product is superior in most ways ... of course, except for the live performance aspect ... that is always magical.
1581806574|5.0|She was thrilled to get this!  Says she is learning a lot of new things about different techniques for drawing.
B000TENK4K|5.0|I've read reviews of people who think the songs have too many repetitive elements.  That's part of what hooked me on this album.  This album is a statement on what we are.  Our society drowns in a repetitive lifestyle.  &#34;Technologic&#34; is a prime example of our repetitive lifestyles enhanced by modern technology.  &#34;Television Rules the Nation,&#34; yes it does.  People often relate to one another through their interest in television shows and news.  The main reason I love this album is the vocoding and the synthesizers.  In this album repetitive rules.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great movie and great delivery.  Recommend it to anyone looking for an incredibly fast paced and balanced adventure.with believable and sympathetic characters.  Showed it to my daughter to highlight the other side...
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Good movie by Tommy Lee Jones. Not too bad. Good storyline. A type of movie to watch when you just have nothing else to do.
B009GX69RK|5.0|One of the best shows out!!!! I can't get enough of this show... The character Nick Miller super funny! Winston, Schmidt, Jess... I love them. Tuesday nights just got a whole lot better!
B002AT4K9G|5.0|wow fast & furious won't never get old i can watch this like a million times, its like seein it for the first time.
098357670X|4.0|Picked up some good pointers. I liked the format and enjoyed the way he approached a detailed study with light heart yet through look at key factors of a good caricatures.
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|To me this book represents the quest of the human being for the presence of God not only in himself but in all other beings. The oneness of I and God.<br />In it we see and experience the mastery of man<br />When he sees himself as being the individualization of God. How he masters the elements and finally<br />Conquers himself and his environment.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great stress reliever for me. I use it when I need to just turn my brain off from all the everyday stresses and just cut loose.
630471193X|5.0|Excellent movie for the whole family.Fast delivery and in excellent condition.Can watch it over and over again.Has humor and sadness both.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|This stylus works great on our Kindle and iPad.  Three different size tips are a plus but it has no tether, relegating its storage to my pocket for safekeeping.  Overall it is worth its price.
B0000DELW2|5.0|The songs are great. Makes you think you are there watching him sing. Any thing with Andy is a  good buy. He well always be missed with his Smooth singing. This is a must to add to your collection. Ilene

B002MGNNFY|3.0|I really love this movie, its a great psychology flick but I have two issues, I cant get it on my mobile device, and I can only access it with an internet access. I wont use the Amazon movie store again
B001NOQI3U|5.0|... is that of a true master. The storyline, the songs, and cast made this a much loved movie in my mind.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie and anything of its kind. The way they made and filmed this is amazing and a true cinematic experience for anyone.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|... in a recording studio make this CD soundtrack more alive than others. The fact these songs were lifted from the film itself shows hot talented the actors/actresses in the movie are.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you only do one thing I say, give me $1,000,000.  If you are looking for a book recommendation from me: read this one.  I've read a lot, and this was an amazingly provocative tale.  I can't wait for the story to continue.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Keeps your attention so you can't wait to see what happens next.  Haven't finished but it looks to be a suspenseful ending.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|This is a great movie if you are drunk. If you are not drunk, you should get drunk while watching it. If you do not drink, then don't bother with this.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|In the continuing saga, you cannot help but be drawn into the characters.  A Feast for Crows serves it's main purpose (for those reading the series as a marathon session, having been driven to it by the HBO series) which is to maintain your interest to get through the book and into the next one.  It is interesting and the characters real and familiar.  Being just over half way through book five now, some old friends have still not returned, and I'm wondering if they will (or will I have to wait for book 6 to be completed to catch up to them).  This may never end.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Using it with my old Sony Digital PC9 digital handicam. Super easy to install a camera, I like that it has a base that keeps it balanced. Mounted a LED light on top and I can get some interesting shots holding this grip like a gun or using it for low shots holding it from the top. People have asked where I got this grip after playing with my camera, and I told them the price on Amazon is a no brainer. When I hold it from the top there is a little flex in the plastic, compared to something stiffer that could be made of aluminum or another metal instead of plastic. Shot cans be a little shaky holding it from the top grip compared to holding it like pistol styled. The X-Grip is pretty light and does not add alot of weight to your camera.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Of course, nothing beats the original.  The movie was great, because the music was in the context of the story.  The original soundtrack is great, because everyone knows the songs by heart and the way that they're sung.  The quality of the vocalists (stars) in this version is fairly mediocre, so, unless getting it to prepare to watch the movie, this recording doesn't stand up on its own as something you'd want to add to your music collection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great story! I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks hits another home run with this one. I can't wait to see the movie too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book!  I look forward to the rest of the series. Hope that they are as good!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I missed it at the local theater so thank you Amazon for having this available !! Great movie, good acting. Will watch it again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Neat to watch the Families grow up and children become the leaders of the world.  Cannot wait for the final book to come out.  Ken Follett is a master author
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but I feel like it missed something. The stories about the camp and camp life are disturbing. The stories about the man who escaped are just flat. There is no hero in this book. The only people I even ended up liking at the end were the Americans who help this guy after his resettlement.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it reminds me of my youth when I when to the country fair tone of fun<br />play it you'll love it
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love it so glad I finally purchased it, missed them in concert this time but not next! They rock!! love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I heard so much about this series, but didn't want to try it, but now that I have I can't wait til the next installment!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Exceptional. The seasons only get better!!! If you liked anything in the first and second season, you're going to love this :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Keeps you attention throughout the book.  Wonderful love story.  Another awesome book by Nicholas Sparks.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This screwdriver is well made and looks exactly like the one from he series. I was very pleased with he purchase.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I chose this rating because I had a bad experience with the case. It does waterproof well and worked when I did the water test, but it really hurts with the phones functionality. My touch screen wasn't working as well which made texting a real pain. To make it worse, people couldn't hear me as well when speaking and the case made it harder for me to hear people. I wouldn't buy it again, but I may use it if I ever go on a trip where there will be a lot of water. Otherwise, it was a big disappointment.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|good game slightly short but fun especially for short spurts of spare time. interesting game pretty cool storyline. lol lol
B005TOW9JM|5.0|Whether I'm cleaning the house, snowboarding, or just looking to get going, this is my go-to album.  It sounds just like Justice, only more mature and refined.  If you liked Cross, you'll love Audio, Video, Disco!!

1419707299|5.0|Oldest grandson loves these books, so when my other grandson was interested, I quickly sent him one. I think they get children who don't really care to read, a reason to. They are in cartoon form which is appealing, and they are a fast read.

B004HD61KE|3.0|Good reading but could have had more twist and turns and more mystery of the founding fathers would recommend to history buffs and the people who believe in secret societies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. I had to wait so long to get it because we didn't have a credit card. But my mom finally got a debit card and wow this game is the best ever south better than temple run.

0385335997|5.0|I have become a true Diana Gabaldon fan!  I believe she is a gifted storyteller and happy am I that she discovered what I believe is her 'nitch'! Until beginning the Outlander series i did not enjoy fiction. However this Author and this series has won me over.  She does an excellent job of developing the story line and combining facts regarding the geography of Scotland and its rich history. It is more than obvious that she has done her homework well!  This was exactly what i was looking for in recreational reading and am delighted by all that i have been learning as a result of this authors diligent research.  i hope this series continues for a long time!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie, this is a &#34;must-have&#34; for your car and music player.  Loved that _most_ of the songs from the movie were on here.  Was disappointed to see that the song from the shower scene was not included--that was awesome.<br /><br />Props to Anna for the &#34;Cups&#34; song.  She is absolutely aca-brilliant!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have worked a lot of puzzles on line some time ago and thought I would enjoy these, but did not.
B001P1MZNI|3.0|The music is out of sight and Sinatra is in his prime! I could listen to this one endlessly for hours ... if the disc quality were not so poor. The mix is very harsh and uncomfortable. The MP3 download is a fraction of the cost and loses just enough digital 'edge' in the conversion process to make it much more pleasant to hear.
0307592731|4.0|I generally avoid memoirs, but what drew me to Wild was its setting on the Pacific Crest Trail. I've only hiked a tiny bit of it, but someone close to me hiked the whole thing, from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. In my role as supply-box-sender (like Strayed's friend Lisa), I got a pretty good sense of the strength and determination required to undertake such a hike. It's clear from the book that Strayed possesses those qualities, too.<br /><br />Of course a redemption story (and this is one) is no good unless there is plenty of sin to be redeemed, and Wild is full of that: drugs, sex, bad boyfriends, a dysfunctional family, a broken marriage. The death of Strayed's mother begins the book, and grieving runs through it. This is the part I liked the least, but then I told you I don't like memoirs. If you've read Mary Karr or Tobias Woolf or Dave Eggers, you've got the picture here, and those three are better memoirists.<br /><br />The trail part of the story is more compelling. It seems likely to me that Strayed was in possession of the necessary distance-hiker strength and determination before she ever set foot on the trail. Her accounts of her painful feet, of her loneliness and desire (more than once) to quit, of her physical and spiritual hungers, of the people she meets and the dangers she encounters seem true and are often moving. The resupply boxes with the twenty dollar bills, the new (and well-chosen) books and some other amusing items function almost like a character. Will they be there for her or not?<br /><br />The book ends in a literary way, with Strayed, at the end of her hike, looking out at the Columbia River, the border between Oregon and Washington. It's clear that this is meant to be a metaphor for a better life going forward and a difficult life left behind. That's nice, but the rest of the book suggests that life is really more complicated than that.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and find it very relaxing and fun. I think it is great for seniors to help fine tune recognition skills.
030758836X|3.0|I read this because of the hype and the hype kept me going over the slow beginning.  The twists and turns kept me reading well past bedtime. The story was a bit too far fetched for me, however.  And I wasn't totally satisfied at the ending.  But overall, I liked it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good read, much better than catching g fire. I am very curious how this will be transpired to a book

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|There were a few points in the book where it felt like the author was using mysterious revelations to cover up plot holes.  Overall an enjoyable read.  I'm now reading the second book in the series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hubby plays this incessantly.  I guess I will need to look for more versions and eventually buy the longer version.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I have no idea what the attraction is to this show.  I was never a soap opera buff and it is a rather sudsy production but I am thoroughly besotted with it.  The character development (with a couple of exceptions) and the acting are extremely well done and it's wonderful to have access to the original UK version rather than the inexplicably edited US version.

B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|The cinematography is wonderful, the story is compelling, the lead character actors (child, adult) are excellent.  It only got four stars because I didn't have that feeling of Wow at the end.
B000HKYN74|5.0|Catching up on episodes that I missed when the show was on TV.  The quality of the video matches HD on cable and can be watched at any time.  I highly recommend Amazon Prime.
B00452J5IW|1.0|I am acquiring the entire collection slowly. I love all the albums, but this one really stinks!!! It's way too political. Not everyone who may like their music appreciates their espousing their viewpoints in song!!!!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|A deep review of the history of mankind, an excellent analysys and understanding of the current situation worldwide.<br />I highly recomend this book.
B002C949KE|5.0|Dan Ariely is a master of explaining human beings' way of decision making. and although most of us will be unable to change, maybe we'll understand our deepest motives.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this app on my ipod touch and I love it! I was so happy to find it on my kindle fire!!!! YOU SHOULD GET IT!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am a novice when it comes to technology but somehow I easily managed to have this version play instantly and flawlessly on my big screen TV.  I am absolutely hooked on Downton Abbey because of the superb acting, setting, and dialog. The characters are portrayed in such detail that I feel personally connected to each and every one.  They make me want to delve into my family tree documenting my English ancestry that has come from the same circumstances.  I have enjoyed being able to keep the lively, fast-moving story going at my own convenience and pace  with this venue.  The liberal ranting about this promoting class warfare makes no sense at all.  This is real life history and that's just the way it is.
0307474259|1.0|Another fad diet book.  Taubes does not present a balanced or healthy diet and lifestyle.  On what crazy basis are pepperoni sticks considered a nutritious snack?!  Not enough common sense for my liking.<br /><br />If you want to lose weight, read Geneen Roth and Michael Pollan.  Eat real food and ditch the fad diet books.
076781214X|5.0|Always loved this movie, and it is hardly ever on t.v, so for the price I couldn't go wrong with this purchase
1400052173|5.0|Anybody who thinks that the medical establishment's secret exploitation of African-Americans in the name of science ended with the notorious Tuskegee Experiment of 1932 has another thing coming. Those familiar with the book \\"Medical Apartheid\\" are well aware that such nefarious practices have persisted to the present.<br /><br />However, the little-known case of Henrietta Lacks has got to be one of the most jaw-dropping yet.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks developed a very aggressive form of cervical cancer and passed away a few months later at the tender age of 31. She died a pauper and her remains were buried in an unmarked grave.<br /><br />That might very well have been the end of the story, except for the fact that, without her consent or even knowledge, doctors took a sample of her cancerous tumor. As it turned out, her rapidly-reproducing malignant cells had a unique quality in that they were miraculously immortal, the landmark discovery would prove to be invaluable in the development of everything from the polio vaccine to in-vitro fertilization to the Genome Project to cloning.<br /><br />High praise indeed is in order for the author for fashioning such a compelling narrative of Henrietta Lacks' humble life, death and everlasting gift to humanity, while simultaneously shedding light on some serious ethical issues which had been conveniently swept under the rug until now.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005FCX4VA Read the full review and more book reviews from AALBC.com on your Kindle Edition]]
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Always liked this movie, but another one of my favorites that isn't on t.v much, so again for the price, I couldn't go wrong with this purchase
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very excellant movie, thanks to the super story of the bravery of the Canadian embassy and their Iranian staff that definitely risked their lives.
0446554995|1.0|This has got to be the worst book in the series. I struggled to get through it and hated myself the entire time for not just giving up. For authors that I used to enjoy, this was an incredibly frustrating slog through really poor writing. At least three times they used the device \\"...or will they?!?!?\\" to build suspense. \\"They wont look in the bathroom.....OR WILL THEY?!?!??\\". I couldn't help but think \\"I will finish this book...OR WILL I?!?!?!?\\" That wasn't suspenseful in the 40s, why would it be now?<br /><br />Two separate and unrelated characters in annoying subplots decide their only recourse is to resort to breaking and entering to solve their dilemmas. Because one just wasn't enough and new ideas don't grow on trees, you know!<br /><br />Agent Perdergast is somehow not in jail or at least released from the FBI for committing SERIOUS and some would say criminal acts of interfering with an investigation!<br /><br />Nazis.....again! See above for Ideas and trees.<br /><br />How do you convince a Brazilian law enforcement officer that a crime in his city was committed by people from a neighboring Brazilian city? You show him pictures of a crime in New York City, 4700 miles away, that resemble a crime that occurred in his own city and just tell him where you think the killers originated but offer no evidence and have no backing from your law enforcement institution. See? it's obvious!!! If it happened in New York too then it must come from the neighboring South American city! Duh!<br /><br />And perhaps most sadly for me, Detective Vincent D'Agosta is rendered completely impotent and incompetent as an investigator. According to this book, he is apparently incapable of tying his own shoelaces without the help of or at least the advice of the eccentric FBI agent.<br /><br />The end is somewhat predictable and sets itself up for yet another sequel. And befitting the hero, if any murders occur in the next book by the hand of the villain in this one it will be COMPLETELY on Pendergast's hands because of his lame actions at the end of Two Graves.<br /><br />This may be the end of the line for as far as this series is concerned.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very good game, nice graphics &amp; hints available when needed. Could hardly put down. Will definitely recommend to all my friends that play hidden object games.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|It was very easy to buy. Plus it was easy to watch. The entire family loved it! Great movie. thank you!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I could not download it on my Coby android<br />Tablet. Could you please make it downloadable so I can pick up ITBN.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First-rate entertainment and so easily purchased at a reasonable price and downloaded to & watched on my Kindle Fire. Amazon Prime is a great service.
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|this movie is so good, you will love the ending when... well, this movie is great with wonderful acting by douglas and sheen (before drug over use). see martin sheen play daddy to son charles though, i can't help but feel martin is miscast - his acting is off, slow, too casual and not believable. douglas makes up for anyones short coming. he's an in your face shark; ready to eat up any company, destroy anyones life, just to make a measly 10 million but he does not play by any rules. he makes his own. true drama drawn from the headlines of insider trading that will make you feel the dirty side of wall street. must own. this movie is too good not to see over and over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was very surprised how much I liked this book. I'm not too into high school setting romances, but this book took me by surprise! I could'nt put it down! Very well written and good character development.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I got this after beating my friend's original perplexus. First of all, I love it and one thing that i love is that I haven't been able to beat it in a few hours that the original. It's challenging and fun and will give you more than your money's worth in game length. There's a lot of cool points in the track such as the skydive, the ramp, the stairs, the tube, and the ball lift as I call them, There are a couple points where you can't get as good a look at where the ball is around all the other track, but it only happens in a few places and is a good trade-off for the amount of complexity they point into this thing.<br /><br />There is just one thing that bugs me, which is why it's getting 4 and not 5 stars, is that when the ball falls off the track, there are many, MANY places where it gets stuck between the clear plastic case and the tracks inside. This can make it frustrating to get the ball back into potion at the start or practice points. If the clear case was just 1mm larger in diameter, I think this wouldn't be a problem, or maybe the inside track isn't centered in mine... I'm not sure. This wasn't an issue with the original. Has anyone else been having this issue with the Epic?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was completely taken aback with Gone Girl. It was not what I was use to reading or expecting. I started the book on the plane to my NYC vacation and finished it before I got home. This book was the perfect blend of suspense, mystery, romance. I thought the writier did an amazing job of making you feel one way about the characters and then the complete opposite way by just turning the page! I also love that it gave both perspectives of the story. My only complaint was the the ending seemed rushed. Everyone i have reccommended it to LOVED it!<br />It is a must read, and so far the best book I have read.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Great movie.  Stays with traditional suspense and techno savvy.  Watched all of the original series years ago and have always liked the set up for the plot.
1410430103|5.0|I love the Lee Child &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; series. He does what cops can't do. He gets results that are morally correct. Unfortunately real cops have their hands tied by so much red tape and &#34;political correctness&#34; that the bad guys go free and the good guys are punished. Jack Reacher makes sure this is NOT the case.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fabulous<br /><br />, A BIT SLOW for the first third of the book but then really picked up. Hard time putting it down. Didn't want it to end.  Thank you! 41/2 stars

B0002HYFEI|4.0|A toy all of my kids enjoy. Well crafted and not made of plastic. It is a little expensive, but we will be adding to the collection.
0425252868|5.0|This is a terrific read even if you're not particularly interested in military aviation history. The author did a great job of providing just enough technical and tactical detail to inform the general reader without distracting from the story retold here. The main focus is on the two pilots, German fighter ace Franz Stigler, and B-17 pilot Charlie Brown. This book gives the reader a taste of the human experience of war. Highly recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great read. It keep me guessing. It has a lot of twist and unexpected turns. Characters were well expressed. I have never read any of this author's books, but I will certainly look for more of her books.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I found the text easy reading but power-packed research on the processes of building the conditions which will most likely lead to a successful life.  I appreciate that Tough looked specifically at the children who had the most strikes against them, yet used  research supported practices from nuroscience and psychology to demonstrate how troubled young lives can have hope for success in a holistic way.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read - fast moving - Mitch does it again, while<br />showing his softer side.<br />Could not put it down
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie is a must see.<br />Well written, great animations, story line is amazing.<br />The music is so good.<br />Classic.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I really like being able to access Dropbox everywhere! This works as expected and delivers Dropbox's terrific service right to the Kindle.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Mostly historically accurate with a little added drama. This is a great teaching tool to help students envision the beginnings of American government. It's lighthearted, though, so mostly just good to give them a general idea.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Still catching up on the previous seasons that we never watched; my family and I are loving having the DVD's around to pop into the player whenever we are in the mood.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am not a reader but many people told me that I would love these books. What I like is that yes there was a lot of sex but there was a great story line.
4898153194|5.0|A truly wonderful story of an uncommon and deep bond between a woman and a kitten . One of the beautiful books .
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really liked the characters in this story and it was a great storyline. Saw the writing on the wall before it happened a couple of times but still a great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this is a awesome game:) things I like about the game....... I love the new graphics the bigger ape&quot; bigger the better!!&quot; and all the new meneus and upgrades! :)<br />in all I love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002GJU54E|3.0|In the opening scenes of [[ASIN:B001PF87EU Plum Spooky]], we once again see Stephanie Plum involved in her usual bounty hunting, plus a little extra something.  Diesel, another hunky guy with special qualities, has popped into her life, and hovering nearby is his cousin Wulf Grimoire, a power-hungry evil entity.<br /><br />Wulf has partnered up with some power mad science geniuses in an effort to control the elements.  And in the Pine Barrens of Jersey, a whole cast of quirky characters will plunge the story into a quagmire of challenges that also include a lot of monkeys.<br /><br />What do the monkeys have to do with the scheme the scientists are brewing?  How will Stephanie manage to keep Diesel under control while he is camping out in her apartment?  And how will one particular monkey named Carl seem to add that special something to the story?<br /><br />As usual, Stephanie gets into a lot of trouble on her way to catching her bounty, and there are still the familiar hot men:  Morelli and Ranger.  But they are minor characters in this particular romp that had me turning pages rapidly, even as I knew that in the end, Stephanie and her cohorts would save the day.  3.5 stars.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|This came in pretty fast and it had no scratches playing through.<br />Probably one of my favorite movies with Jim Carrey.
B009APMNB0|1.0|I used the Huey for many years and decided to try a newer version to calibrate my PC monitor, so I ordered the Smile. I'm not smiling! I was not able to get it to work at all. The software seemed to install OK but then it said that the installation failed. So I removed the program and tried to re-installed it, and it failed again and again and again. I give up. Reading the other reviews, it looks like a lottery to see if you have one of the lucky computers that it likes. I'll check Ebay for an old Huey.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I love this movie and showed a few other friends this one. They would have been confused if I hadn't explained it to them and they most likely wouldn't have understood it. My sister even had to explain it to me. It is confusing, but if you pay attention to just about every detail, it's a pretty impressive movie!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This has been my most favorite season yet!! The characters have grown a lot this season!! Can not wait to watch the rest of the season!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Excellent, a real page turner!<br />I have been a fan of David Baldacci for many years. This book is one of his best.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Great movie. One must view around the Christmas Vacation time :-)  ( 9 more words for review, alsmost there.done) drat
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A great read. The vocabulary of the protagonist is not what one would expect. I have never encountered a teenager in life or fiction like this one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Had to have mahjong on my first handheld, Kindle Fire for Christmas, like traditional symbols. Enjoy the multiple game layouts.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|If you enjoy historical fiction. This book is a must. The characters really come to life and have voices that should be heard.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|So many twists. I can't wait to read the next book. I have the slightest idea what will happen next.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|This book was a good book.  This girl is so brave and strong, I didn't realize it was a real true story!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book was for certain uplifting. Reminders of being optimistic, believing in true love and 2nd chances. We all deserve them. I really enjoyed it. Much better than the movie. However,the movie was pretty good too.
B001AQO46E|5.0|This is not a rating of the movie per se - the movie gets 5 stars from me. This is the question how long the fans of this movie have to wait for the long awaited and long-overdue blu-ray release of this great movie from mastermind James Cameron. Lets hope that the long waiting time means, that the studio (20th Century Fox) will release a version that has all the \\"bells and whistles\\" in extras and quality that this awesome movie truly deserves!Where is the Blu-ray version????
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|Great music! makes you feel in the movie and little disappointed that the soundtrack would not include the theme song.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Generally a fascinating look into the life of Lincoln and his contemporaries. Lincoln clearly was a magnificent and astute politician. Wish there were more like him today.  At time the reading is tedious as his relationship with Mary or his Cabinet contemporaries was presented in excruciating detail.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Excellent season. Gibbs and the gang do not disappoint new and loyal viewers. Palmer is an added favorite as well.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea at his best!! Not to be missed for those of you who follow Andrea Bocelli and his amazing career.
1451627297|1.0|I actually put this book down about a quarter of the way into it, because I just wasn't into it. I picked it back up when I went on a cruise and didn't have access to download a new book, so I decided to finish it.<br /><br />Waste of time. Not only was it boring and cheesy at times, it also was pretty prejudice at times. Even in the afterword, King states that \\"some may think he was too hard on Dallas\\" but goes on to justify it. I live close to Dallas, and anyone know lives here will tell you it's an extremely diverse city, as are all the largest cities in our country. King portrays Texans in general as backwards, racist hillbillies. I'm not saying that it doesn't exist, but King's own preconceptions are glaring in this work. Women and minorities are victims, the south is full of gun toting rednecks, etc. I understand King is very liberal, and I don't care if he writes that into his character.. what I don't get it is why anyone who is trying to sell a product would put down some of the people buying. Not a smart move.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A thoroughly smooth and engrossing Follett read.  Well researched for factual correctness.  An interesting  integration  of factual and fictional personal characters.
0345803485|2.0|OMG cannot believe the hipe over this book. I read it and you couldn't pay me to read the others. All I could think of if people find this so over the top..how sad for them. My spelling is horrible but I even notice two words that didn't belong..dang auto correct!!! But her descriptions were more from a teenagers view to me than a mature woman. Sorry I shelled out the 10 bucks for it...thats 2 cups of coffee I could have had.
B004Y042N8|1.0|I hate this game with a passion... worst game i ever downloaded and this essay is making it much worse.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|I couldn't put this down I was reading it on my kindle and when I was out of the house I was reading it on my phone!
1451695195|1.0|I just read Eben Alexander's book \\"Proof of Heaven.\\" Well to be honest -- part of it -- I'll explain later. It has to be the worse NDE book I ever read. First, he didn't clinically die, but beyond that, he gave very limited details about supposedly being in heaven. I am always excited to read about NDEs and his was an extreme disappointment.<br /><br />He gave silly names to a few certain places he said he was, but basically the book was an autobiography of his life. After the first couple chapters I started skipping his retelling of his college years, how he knows everything about the brain, his life with his wife, his depression about his adoption, his hospital stay, and what all his family members were doing. (Well I guess I read some of that since I know about it, but I did start skimming paragraphs very early on when I knew he wasn't relating anything about heaven.) When reading about someone's NDE, having some background on their life is great, but the majority of this book is all about his life or him trying to convince the reader that NDEs are real. Why would I care or want to read about Eben Alexander's life? And believe me, people who read these books generally believe in the NDE so you don't have to convince us. I feel like he really wasted my time. I think his writing of this book in the guise of a NDE was his narcissistic way of trying to become famous.<br /><br />I wanted details about heaven and he didn't have any. What was funny was his arrogance in saying he traveled farther into heaven than any other person who has ever had a NDE (and he makes a point to say he isn't being arrogant, it just a fact.) It is interesting that if he traveled more deeply into the heavenly realm, why couldn't he relate any specific details? I think he just took information from other NDEs and used the generalities in his book, and he even did that poorly. I'll give you pretty much everything he said in a nutshell right here: heaven is love, you can do no wrong in heaven,words can't describe his experience because earthly words are so limiting, there are other higher universes (no details of course) and any questions he had were telepathically answered immediately in depth. To bad he didn't relate to the reader some of his supposed question/answer sessions . . . at least that would have been something. Thank goodness I just borrowed this book from the library and didn't pay for this nonsense.<br /><br />I recommend Betty Eadie, Mary C. Neal (who is also a doctor), or Dannion Brinkley's books. Whether you believe in NDEs or not, they are definitely more interesting books that actually provide specific details of their time in heaven.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was a great read!!! Honestly the first quarter of the book was hard to get thru. I had to force myself to get thru the first part, but then the book was so interesting that I couldn't put it down!!! So many twists and turns...a must read!!!!!!!!
B004IFD9HE|5.0|We love this movie - it's great for a wide age-range! Funny for adults, mild enough and entertaining for toddlers.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was really good but it is like a middle book<br />I mean nothing shocking really happened thanks to those spoilers
B0096PAA6E|5.0|After seeing him at the Austin City Limits Festival a few years ago, it was clear that he would be around for a long time playing fantastic blues and rock and whatever he felt like playing.  It's all good.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|4 star rating.  I loved the story.  Sparks, as always, an easy read.  Her characters are very strong.  Great job.
0307346617|5.0|Sometimes it's hard to remember this is fiction, it seems so real.  Hope this doesn't happen. If it does, use this book as a guideline.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|This is an &#34;OK&#34; series. The general premise of saving the world from aliens is interesting, and is executed well for the most part, but the homosexuality theme that runs through the series is disturbing and off-putting. Lack of closed captions detracted from my enjoyment
B006LSZECO|5.0|I coudn't wait to read it each night and i didn't want it to end. It was a story well told.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Wow what a captivating novel.  Extremely interesting, and would highly recommend this book to any young girl/woman who is thinking of dieting all the time.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book to be very informative and comforting.  It just goes to show that you should never give up hope, no matter what the situation is.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast paced action with simplistic character development.  Interesting premise and nventive story line.  Enjoyable and easy reading. Give it a try
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I find this book one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. This man is a true hero who overcame adversity and a sure honor less life to a life full of purpose. This type of man is one our children should see as there hero not a shallow sports, movie or music star.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|There's plenty of meat to roast here - the character of Alfred Hitchcock alone could carry most screenplays - but the plot constantly finds itself caught up in dry, semi-interesting wrinkles at the expense of the main attraction. In its best moments, when Hitchcock is allowed to be his sarcastic, dismissive self, it's loads of fun, if a bit indulgent. As the second act stretches on, though, those occasions become fewer and further between. Anthony Hopkins can be quite convincing in the lead role, but he's also inconsistent - in certain scenes you'd swear Hitch is alive and well, while in others it's just Hannibal Lecter in makeup with a blubbery accent. Helen Mirren, who plays his wife Alma, fares much better but is often held captive by stuffy, unwanted elaborative scenes. While Hitchcock remains focused on the task at hand (that is, the conception and production of Psycho) it's a guilty pleasure, perhaps crowded with too many nods and winks. The problem is, it provides just enough of that to tease what could've been, then redirects us to the misplaced, seen-this-before relationship drama it actually is.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Classic Clancy at its best. I found this book to be a very good read much in the same way I liked Red Dawn for its fast paced action combined with very believable detailed conflict scenarios. This story could happen, and funny enough I read this book at the same time as Chinese military was accused of large scale hacking in the US...<br /><br />I would recomend this to anyone who consider themselves Tom Clancy fans
1451695195|5.0|I think this book is very informative and would help people who have lost loved ones. It can be very comforting.
B000SW2ER2|2.0|I enjoy all types of Sci Fi, and this is an old story. Maybe because I read the book but I enjoyed the book much more than this move. I was falling asleep......
1401902197|5.0|I can do it its an amazing book, it is changing my way to see every day life !! I really recommended you to buy it, you will never regretted!!
B002N57KG2|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Its funny and keeps your interest. My DVD player refused to play it, but it worked great on the X-Box......
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book! Many nights I couldn't sleep because I wanted to know what happened next. Now I have to read the next book.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was an out standing movie. It had lots of action and told a story. The ending was the beging of an awesome saga.....
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game because it is challenging and makes me thinknabout what I'm gonna do next. thanks zepto lab
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Failed to capture the audience in my opinion. Weak plot! The only thing holding it together are some of the action scenes.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I was bored, per se, and so I clicked on this.  the singing is good and good to watch when one is bored or totally nothing else to watch.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|i have loved everthing that i have gotten for you.  this music is wonderful and was simple to down load.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book.  Keeps you turning the page.  Interesting characters.  I would definitely recommend it.  Not sure I loved the ending, though.
0671646788|4.0|I just received the book yesterday, 2/20/13, and completed reading the book today(2/21/13). It has a lot of positive and uplifting options that must be included in someone's mind to become more focused on determined on exactly what is needed if we are to realistically achieve goals for ourselves, regardless of the odds. Although, the book copyright was in 1959, 1965, then 1978. A lot of the ideas are very current. However, there was a refernce to salaries ($15K as being an average salary (OMG back in the day) and minor incidents, ie someone bumped into the back of another person's car and the one who lightly tapped the rear of the other car got out of his car smiling and being positive to the other guy, etc. HOWEVER, the person in the book was &#34;cool&#34; about the situation. I can't fathom doing that currently in 2013. Especially, the many incidents of &#34;Road Rage&#34; that turn deadly for much minor situations.  Very positive about aging, people thinking that they are too old and people thinking that they are too young to be managers, etc. Well worth reading.
B000S88JTS|5.0|One of the greatest &#34;cult&#34; films of all time.  Bruce Brown follows the success of &#34;The Endless Summer&#34; with the quintessential motorcycling classic. Steve McQueen really could ride!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Man, I don't even know how to write my feelings about this album. I guess I could just go with &#34;I love it&#34; or &#34;It makes me feel as sexy as I possibly can&#34; or even, &#34;It makes me want to hump,&#34; but I feel like those comments would either be too simple or too crass. I will leave it at this, it has probably been my best buy since my 25 cent backpack.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this all of the time I would be lost without it.  Works great thanks for the app.  I have so many uses for a calculator
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great game the entire family can enjoy with a huge replay factor. You only need your wit in this game as you try and ask other players to trade resources with you. You really see how people get when it comes to helping you out in the game. Great game overall although you must be careful as the entire game board is made with fairly thin yet pretty sturdy. Easy to learn and understand.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've heard great things about this book and since the movie is coming out, I thought I would read it. Chbosky's writing style is flawless. I couldn't put my Kindle down. I look forward to seeing how they produce the movie and the comparison between the two. This book will be one I read over and over again.
0060989157|5.0|If you like Motley Crue this will be a great book for you.  It was sweet to learn about the band members' early lifes and how the band evolved into one of the greatest 80's bands of all time.  Go Crue!
1451695195|5.0|A most fascinating and touching recounting of a man's journey to heaven--and back. Has a great deal of credibility, since the man is a neurosurgeon and understands the workings of the brain better than us regular folks. I have always suspected that where we go when we die is a plae of pure and unconditional love; it's nice to know I'm right!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love it couldn't put the book down!! It was a beautiful love story!! Can't wait for another sparks book thanks
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its fun but its hard not to crash against the fire.  I like it.  But you have to go for a long time in order to go through the mine.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Good story, and as always I do Like the &#34;Camel Club&#34;. Lots of twists and turns with a heart breaking surprise.
B007CEWR62|5.0|I love this.  It is relaxing to listen to while reading or going to sleep.  I have several Secret Garden albums.  They bring me to wonderful places.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that temple run 2 is harder then the other one.But I think its a good game for me .So i realy didt know there is such thing as temple run 2.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|a good workout, but not what I thought would be coming from a person with her reputation.  It's my first dvd from her, and I will get another.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Happened upon this series and love it!  I could not put this book down.  On to Jack Teacher book number 3!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Just disappointed that that there are only 2 episodes per DVD unlike Season 1 which seemed to have more or the episodes were longer?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was an awesome book a great read. I would recommend  the hunger games trilogy to all of my friends and family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. Very suspenseful. It started out good right from the beginning. i liked the characters. it was great right to the very end!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I fell like doing this in real life but I can't because my mom will get hella mad
0345529057|5.0|I originally bought this set for my mom for Christmas. She's 72 years old and an avid reader. She returned the set to me and said it's too complicated-- she said she can't enjoy the reading when she has to think so hard to follow along. My son, on the other hand, loves it! He especially likes the references in the back of the book, but he says he needs &#34;empty time&#34; to read it so he can focus on the plot. I haven't had any spare time to read it yet and judging from what I've heard so far, I'll need a quiet place and lots of &#34;empty time&#34; when I do! It's definitely on my &#34;must-read&#34; list.
0865478007|5.0|First of all this excellent book is not just a critique of big pharmaceutical companies.  He includes academics, journals, and regulatory agencies.  Secondly, the fact that big pharmaceutical companies have in the past or currently produce life saving drugs does NOT excuse other bad behavior.  If I did something to save 100 lives, does that allow me to kill 50 people with a free pass?  Of course not.  Goldacre in this book and as a physician recognizes the tremendous good that proper use of drugs can do.  But this book is a remarkable effective critique of what is wrong with the whole system and I strongly recommend everyone read it. Very well done book.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Good family fun with great special effects.  Movie would have been just as good without the couple of swear words in it.  Hollywood just has to put cuss words into everything they do.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was an excellent book. Well written, interesting characters, complex time and place. It is hard to put down. It obviously does not lose anything in translation.
B000I9VZKW|5.0|Great movie, great acting, and as always Will Smith was awesome.  Great futurist movie, if you are in to those sorts of things.
B000EWBKM6|2.0|The one and only episode in Series Finale is an exact match to Season 8's last show, and I wasn't thrilled with the ending.<br /><br />I'm happy the Final Season was inexpensive. A penny over 5.00 would be over-priced.<br /><br />To top if off, I was disappointed with so few Special Features. I assumed there would be a few hours of Bloopers, Deleted Scenes, etc, but no such luck.<br /><br />I loved and miss Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. The four-some were a riot. Seasons 1-8 are 5-star shows, 'all but the last episode anyway.'<br /><br />Unless a person feels Series Finale is a must have, I'd pass it up.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie.  Great acting, great plot line, all the characters I am looking for; wonderful all around movie.
1419702238|5.0|My son hates to read, but ever since the series of wimpy kid books came out, he's been reading them over and over. He enjoys the drawings as well as the story
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|As the title states, this is a great soundtrack for an action game. Had this been a typical Metal Gear game (read &#34;Stealth&#34;) it wouldn't have fit the mood at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The price may be outrageous, but it's worth it. The game is awesome. Of all the minecraft games on my kindle fire, this one is most fun and like minecraft. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|requires too much real money to get anywhere.  Fun and addicting.  Ageless exciting to see how you watch the village grow.  Got a message to download update....nothing happened.  CANNOT PLAY THE GAME .
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is so fun and interesting.<br />You can find anything you want on it.<br />Explore and share so much.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Although Season 6 was the last season of the show I had come to love and enjoy immensely, and I was a bit disappointed that it would soon be over, this last season was fantastic!  Even better, the ending was acceptable - all things considered!  Do wish that a couple of other questions that were left on the table had been answered, but...  Plan on watching the entire series again whenever I have enough time!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I installed this hoping it would be a little brighter, but it is still handy for those times when you drop your keys on the floor of your car in the dark!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|very interesting for those of us with minimal knowledge of the cosmos. slow loading but then very nice job on the info points and views.
B00422LESO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a fun light read. If you want to read a book that you can just escape into and be entertained, you will probably enjoy this book. I have recommended it to  all my friends who enjoy Jane Austen, Mr. Darcy, and a good giggle.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|A wonderful explorative look at the position of women's place in the family unit of society. Philippa did a wonderful job bringing these women to life. So masterfully written to make you feel as you know them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always enjoy the books in the Harry Bosch series. This was a great read. I am definitely looking forward to another installment in the Harry Bosch saga!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I started this game it was pretty easy. Now I'm addicted. It's a fun and satisfying game to play.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|I have to admit that I am one of those who is periodically guilty of binge viewing. Generally, it's the plot that keeps me watching. But in the case of &#34;House of Cards&#34; it was clearly the characters. This was my second time through this series, and had it not been for the Netflix remake of it I might not have watched it a second time. I'm glad I did, though.<br /><br />So, why not five stars? When something is this good, I have no choice but to compare it to truly great drama. And there, sadly, it falls short. What might easily have been soul-wrenching moral dilemmas instead become exercises in rationalization and denial. And it's exercise that produces very little sweat. (&#34;He: I had no choice. She: You had no choice.&#34;) In general, my fifth star for drama is reserved for those that engage not only the mind and emotions, but also the moral faculties or at least those parts of our decision-making apparatus (dare I call it character?) that are more than merely utilitarian. Great drama makes us look inside ourselves. If I can't imagine asking a classroom of high school seniors or college freshmen to watch it and then write an essay on what they would do in those circumstances, no fifth star. Is that too high a bar? That would be a separate discussion.<br /><br />Fifth star or no, if you are looking for a television series in which the main character can make your skin crawl just by looking into the camera and raising an eyebrow, this is it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a great game, it is really fun to play, the birds, are amazing at what they can do, everyone should try it.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|My husband loves this collection.  If you are an ELO fan this is the collection for you. such great music.  Enjoy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like all of the changes they made to this game.  So exciting.  I am still working out the bugs on how to navigate certain things, but overall a great upgrade to the original.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|each book I've read by Michael Connelly has been a page turner I lived in LA for 10 yrs and I love the location callouts
0765325950|5.0|Prepare yourself.  This book IS THE LAST BATTLE!  It's crazy to think that it's finally here after decades of reading the series, but this is 800+ pages of wham bam thank you battle maam.  Brandon is an expert at creating a quick moving pace, and he did a fantastic job with the last two books, particularly Gathering Storm.  But here, he is in his element.  The entire book is one giant battle/crescendo to the finish with twists and surprises along the way.  I couldn't put it down.  I think I finished it in a day and a half.  Make sure you don't have anything pressing on your agenda and go grab yourself a copy.  A truly fitting end to the masterwork of The Wheel of Time series.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Odd that I found out about this author on a true life TV show (he had insight to the nefarious Chris Wilder)  What a wonderful find for two great series -Harry Bosch and the Lincoln Lawyer
034580404X|5.0|Absolutely loved these books am about to start book three and i am hooked i wish they would never end.. Almost didnt read them because of some of the reviews but i am very glad that i did. And no the books are not all about sex although it is a big part of the books its about unexpected love..
B006RZZ7HS|4.0|I watched this movie to help fill in some of the blanks in the newer Tron: Legacy. Although somewhat hard to follow, still entertaining once you get past the 80's film tech.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love. There is so much detail and twists at every turn As soon as I have an idea of where the books are going I am proven false. Always on my toes. I can't ask for anything more.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Need I say more?<br /><br />Oh yeah and Reznor, once again, does a great job on the film's score.<br /><br />I cant really decide if I like this version or the Swedish version better. Watch both!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|What are we to make of such a strange and abrupt ending to the third season of Downton Abbey? To begin with, was the scene of Matthew sprawled out on the pavement meant to suggest an abrupt ending to what many viewers were led to believe was an endless series? We really don't know whether he was dead or simply looking into the director's camera. If he suffered fatal injuries, it seems only fitting that he shouldn't be left in the middle of the road as an obstacle for other vehicles to avoid. Furthermore, doesn't his family have an obligation to scrape his remains off the pavement and provide him with a proper burial? And was it necessary to bump off two of the most attractive and enlightened members of the family--Sibel and Matthew? However, it's been reported that Dan Stevens (Matthew) recently appeared on Broadway in &#34;The Heiress.&#34; Apparently, he wanted out of his Downton Abbey contract.<br /><br />As Dame Maggie might say, &#34;Really, you mean to say he's still alive and someone saw him chasing an heiress in another play! Traitor! No doubt simply fortune hunting having thrown his inheritance away on Downton Abbey. At least our beloved Abbey may survive another generation before they bring in a wrecking crew to dismantle this oversized dwelling. Oh my, it sounds like I'll be the only member of the family worth listening to or quoting in season four. I hope I'm not under contract to outlive the author of this endless and long suffering series!&#34;
B00358ESI4|5.0|Well written, well acted and well produced account of a pivotal moment in the Vietnam. The producers strove to present a clear eyed, historically accurate and political neutral depiction of a major battle. I think they succeeded admirably. The battle is gory but after all it is about war.<br />I regard this movie as a must see.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've installed the kindle reader on several tablets and my phone. Use it most on my phone cause its easy to hold at night, in bed. Wish I could figure out why all my stuff isn't on all my devices. I seem to have 2 lists one on my Samsung and another on all other devices.  Weird.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I didn't realize the book would be a &#34;teenager&#34; type of book (female and male are both 17).  When I started reading, I almost decided not finish.  I am glad that I did.  The story was a little different than I expected.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard so much talk about Downton Abbey that I finally decided to see what all the hub-bub was about.  I watched Season 1 and had to have more so I bought Season 2.  Such great plot lines that keep you wanting more!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The most fun I have ever had watching a series. I was hooked from Christopher Eccleston to David Tenant and now Matt Smith all of which bring a unique voice to The Dr.
B008C20TDG|3.0|I thought the book made a good case for the paleo life style but I really don't think you need a 30-day shock program to arrive there.  The authors admit that it's likely people will slip back into old habits after completing the program, so why not ease your way into the lifestyle by slowly replacing foods in a way that's sustainable.  At least that's what worked for me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got this app for my children, they play it everyday, though I don't like hearing the birds sound all day but good intertainment for my children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is EPIC it is just like Xbox version it does not crash you can also play with your friends I play it every day I wish I could rate 1,000 stars
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Love Denzel!!! Good Story. Enjoyed the way it played out and the message that was recieved. Good Acting too. Would Recommend
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book. Fast read, could not put it down. No matter what the color of your skin, women were always slaves.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Sounded like it would be boring, but it an amazing show. Absolutely worth watching. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good tv.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|I saw this movie on netflix and knew it would be one that I'd want to watch again. I was right!
B00899ES5C|5.0|I love this show, I hate that I love it but I so love it.  The suspense and mystery is on par with or surpasses anything out today.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This movie as well as it's sequel are both very well done and create great stories for the batman legend.<br /><br />This movie is more about developing who batman has become since retiring and his fight to regain control of Gotham.
0062075195|3.0|These books are NOT deep and thought provoking but they are a lot of fun. It is really easy to get wrapped up in the world and to equally hate and love the characters. They are a true representation of the reality world they represent.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The fight scenes are pretty good.  The joker is his usual menacing self.<br /><br />Superman plays his part, and the movie ends very well!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter is 2 1/2 and loves this game. I do however recommend buying the full versions of the Dr. Panda games if you can.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is almost the cutest movie ever made!!! I love it!!! Its adorable, and clean. I just like it a lot.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Absolutely  riveting...complex, but keeps you going in suspense. Loved it  I wish the next part was out now.  Worth the price.
1439156816|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone in the writing world. Fiction or non-fiction, young or old, Steven King gives advice from his life and from his craft. The first half is auto-biography, the second half is writing advice. Both parts are helpful.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Really great documentary about an era in music. Dave Grohl is the man. I'd watch this movie over and over again.
1449415881|5.0|I get one of these every year to have on my desk at work.  Dilbert puts a smile on my face first thing every morning.
0810970686|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old to read for school. The minute the book came in he started reading it, and he's been in love with these books ever since! In my opinion, any book a kid starts reading right away when he gets back from school, deserves a five star rating!!
0385335997|5.0|If you like a combination of historical drama and science fiction, you will find it an enjoyable read.  Warning:  There are 7 books in the series and you must start with the first novel and read them in sequence.  If not, they will make you crazy.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Ordered this controller since my original one started getting a little flakey. Only wanted the Sony brand and this is exactly what I got, works perfect.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Movie was well done. Action was fast-paced and exciting. One of the best of the series. I loved those scenes at the  Dubai hotel. It blew me away
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game, laid out well,no playing problems.  very good game to pass the time.  highly  recomend. its addicting  best of all its free.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Got time to pass and nothing else on?<br />This is a movie I would deem good to kill time.<br /><br />Yes, it has its exciting moments. It has a good acting.<br /><br /> There are holes in the storyline but you forget that while you are watching it.( it is after the movie ends that you start to dissect everything and realize, it could have been done better.)<br /><br />Minutes could easily have been shaved off this movie- it was a bit protracted and some scenes didn't add much to the story.<br /><br />Love Denzel but this is not one of his best.<br /><br /> He is convincing in the role he plays. So convincing, you feel mixed emotions about his character.<br /><br />  Enjoy it while you are watching it, because it is doubtful this is a movie you will want to watch twice.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This thing is fantastic, but we already know this.  You can't ask much more out of this price range.  The only thing that is gained by the 3770k is hyper threading, which isn't used by most people.  If you're a gamer with a flagship video card, this is for you.  It's fast, efficient, and most of them overclock pretty well.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book for my roommate who is a diehard Star Wars fan. I figured he didn't have this book. He thought it was very cute.
1430308001|5.0|The author makes a great attempt to dumb down a position and dissect all the tactical elements no matter how obvious or elementary. This is great for those in the area of classes E and C. However as a player exceeds that level some of these thought processes do tend to happen AUTOMATICALLY in your head. And if that ends up happening as a result of this book, then the book has exceeded its expectations! Overall I recommend the work for Beginners (who will derive the most out of it) and up to intermediate players (they should know how to solve most of these; but will act as a great review for them especially if they are not too fond of tactics). Advanced players 1800 + ELO ,may find the explanations annoying and elementary since they automatically see the functions of each piece, and the explantions are written in such a way that it conveys the piece function as a revelation.<br /><br />I also endorse the idea of using this type of explanation while solving positions that you don't understand...since it definitely had an effect on my own games as well as some of my peers.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I have always been a fan of Elton John and got to see him in concert in sept. afterwards i wanted a greatest hits cd this one was used but plays like new.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I love this movie. It is visually beautiful and the story is lovely. The DVD itself is in perfect condition. Thanks 5*s
B001L83PLQ|5.0|......... and educational too on the cultural history of Nigeria.  A well narrated story of the traumas of genocide &, civil war.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie and I am so glad I did. What an amazing and touching story. I loved every minute of it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|At first I thought this game was going to be dumb..... far from it! I love this game! Great for Kindle Fire.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|I love the show...just disappointed that Amazon hasn't yet made it so their streaming items can be watched on Tablets.  Netflix does it!  Just much more convenient to watch on tablet, than lug my PC around on the train or to bed to watch my shows...
1439156816|5.0|I have never read any other Stephen King book because I don't like being scared.  I have seen a couple of movies based on Stephen King books because, at the time, I didn't realize they were based on King's books -- the stories were incredible.  I still do not choose to read this genre.  I read King's memoir on writing solely to learn a bit about what makes this author tick and to see what he might have to say to budding writers.  I've read various books on writing including anthologies filled with contributing author's advice. The best advice from any of those writers was to pay attention to Mark Twain, something I already knew and appreciated.  Knowing a bit about King's life enabled me to sympathize with his genre and perceive it as an outlet; a way of communicating personal pain indirectly through that story.  What he had to say about writing warrants keeping and re-reading this book. I loved this book!
014312093X|5.0|This book is not for the inattentive reader. The plots are complicated and interwoven. Also, if you want to make sense of any of the films based on the book, they are incomprehensible without reading the book first.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game was bought for my 7 year old grandson. He loves it so much that I have to fight to get my kindle away from him
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Excellent story and believeable characters.  Good morals, no need to try to filter out parts. These are the kinds of stories that are uplifting.  Thanks.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|The movie was good. It just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I'm a James Bond fan so the movie did exactly what it is supposed to do: Entertain me. If you're looking for a life changing experience, seek psychiatric help. Movies do not serve that purpose. If you're a Bond fan and want a break from your life's responsibilities for a little over two hours, this movie should suffice. And you certainly don't need me to write a novel-length movie review for you to understand that either.
B007MAETA8|5.0|John is so smooth and talented - and his Born and Raised CD is the right mix of songs for this time.  I had purchased this CD as an afterthought, needing to use the last $10 on a gift card - but have listened to many of the cuts quite often since receiving it....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little calculator. The layout is good and aesthetically pleasing. The keyboard and numeric display fill the screen and are easy to read and use. If only all apps were this good!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Having heard individual cuts on the radio so often, it was a pleasant surprise to find very few cuts I didn't love!  Now I share both of my Mumford & Sons CD's with everyone I love.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|If you have nothing better to do it's an ok way to kill roughly about 2 hours, it's not bad but pretty meh.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Sounds like Leonard has not lost his ability to create or sing in his rumbly, grumbly style.  Good to hear more of his wonderful repertoire.....
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|No, just no. Save the money... This movie was about 10 pounds of s@#$ in a 5 pound sack. Back away.
B00723NWJE|4.0|In some ways Little Broken Hearts resembles Norah's earliest albums - but brings in some neat new sounds that are hard to explain in words.  (I'm old school - and waiting for more of her original style).
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|What else can you ask for? It's got a pretty interesting plot, the action is pretty damn good and you find yourself rooting for batman to step it up. Good stuff kids go for.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie was very predictable but fun to watch.  I kept wondering why no one ever turned on the lights in the house.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game its a lot of fun I love playing it I'm addicted. its the perfect virtual horse game ever.
0823015033|5.0|I make miniature dolls, this book has a wonderful chapter on making eyes, which I found extremely helpful. The charts for correct proportions and directions for making tools are fantastic,  I love this book.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Absolutely enjoy this artist such soulful music ! I saw her in concert and this was a nice carry with me reminder of how much I enjoy her .
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old daughter, who is a huge fan of the movie. She's a typical teenager so loves the love story here. I do as well. The first dvd arrived cracked by FedEx but Amazon shipped me a new one super quickly and there were no issues with that one. Amazon has excellent customer service, always!
1592407889|5.0|My exposure to Shirley M. was at dance class in Richmond, VA when we were about 4 yrs. old. I didn't like her on sight. She was Shirley Beatty then and had a mean look on her face all the time. I did not like that she was another \\"Shirley\\" either.  I was there first. It was Mrs. Terrills dancing academy.<br /><br />Anyway, I am really enjoying this book, only half read. HOPE SACHI MAKES LOTS OF $$$$.<br /><br />Further to this review.  Just finished and have to say that Sachi is a much more readable author than her Mom. I did read one of SM's books and now must say \\"What goes around comes around\\".<br /><br />Maybe something for her(Shirley) to ponder.
B00006RIO7|5.0|My wife started to take college credit Jazz dance class.  This is a perfect gift.  She dances and sings all day!
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|This movie is now one of my all time favorites. The Criterion restoration is outstanding and made for a dynamic big screen viewing experience. Like watching a moving piece of art.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I own the movie in 3 formats, vhs, dvd and now the remaster. Best i have seen. I really felt like it was the first time i saw it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks' books. Easy read.  His adjectives makes you feel like you are there.  Looking forward to the movie.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I was looking for a new way to post pictures to social media. I currently don't have a smartphone so was unable to use new phone apps and social media picture sharing sites. This is great, it was exactly what I was looking for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|. It was a captivating read, that I could not put down. I cared about the characters and wanted to see them succeed..
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic! It is such a page turner. I highly recommended this book to any child over 10, or whenever they get the hang of reading chapter books. By the way, Charles Dickens writes the best books if your looking to read another book by him.
B007JOM0GC|4.0|We bought this for our kids and they thoroughly enjoy it.  There are some themes that aren't necessarily appropriate for young children, but they don't understand the lyrics quite yet and enjoy all of the music itself.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I waited for this for years and years after I saw Baraka the first time. I don't get excited about much in life, but when I heard it was coming to select theaters in my area I took off work and made a day of it. I felt like a better person after watching it. I would be willing to buy this for other people, that's how awesome it is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book in the series was amazing.  The second I finished the Hunger Games, I jumped into the Kindle Store and had Catching Fire on the Kindle moments later.  This one was just as good as the first book, and had some added and COMPLETELY unexpected twists and turns that Suzanne Collins put together perfectly.  If you read the first one, I am sure you will read them all...if you have not already done it.  Read it, enjoy it....you will love it more than the first one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is very good. I love it!!!! really really really good. love the horse dietails u can add! hope u enjoy!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Hard to put down. Just wanted to keep reading to find out the reasons why she did it. Easy read. Would be good for a book club.
6301640659|5.0|I began collecting VHS & DVDs around 2001 - and it wasn't until a few years ago I realized an ongoing theme or genre to my films - 75% of them were CONTROVERSIAL in nature. HORROR,  DRAMA, COMEDY,  ACTION. CULT. CLASSIC, B MOVIE whatever the main genre, the film itself Raised some brows. Spawned some protests, Angered some group of people and usually drew crowds and horrific reviews.  Well, CRUISING is no exception.  It angered gays, upset the Ratings Board,  repulsed others....but became one of my top 25 films.  Al Pacino is absolutely wonderful in this film. Directed flawlessly by William Freidkin of Excorcist fame its about the gay  sub culture, S&M / Leather scene.  which in itself is a turn on with SN ugly side a serial killer is on the loose and enjoys killing gay men after having sex with them. It'd a 70s film true to the times.  Scary,  creepy, darkly erotic and perfect for NY controversial collection.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am really enjoying this cute game! It does have a lot of notifications but it is worth it and I cant wait to see what happens.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its good but a bit much to get new games within the game but still get its totally worth it
B0055S348W|1.0|PrintShare Mobile Print does not work at all on my Kindle Fire.  It recognizes my printer but will not print at all.  A waste of money.  I do not believe Amazon should be presenting this as a usable item for the Kindle Fire.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this all the time!  No more pieces of paper for grocery lists, errands or tasks!  I can't tell you how many times I've dropped a pen when trying to grocery shop!  I can easily check of things and even archive lists that I only use once in awhile.
B001AXME2S|5.0|I have seen them 3 times great show. They sing about the good things in life. I like to see them at least once a year
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This is good for the casual fantasy reader, easy to read and fast paced.<br /><br />I don't love the plot but the world created is interesting and original.  I was thoroughly entertained throughout reading the book so I definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's is my favorite game I know you will love it I think you should get this game it's addicting hope you love it
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|graphics are fantastic and the game is well done as it is the same as the dice game.  worthwhile if you're a fan of Lovecraft or Arkham horror.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had seen the movie. I was interested in whether the story matched the movie. I was pleasantly surprised with the story line. I actually enjoyed the book version better than the movie version.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|I have seem every episode from season 1 to season 3 in order and I'm in the process of watching them ALL. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it has been a lot to read but had me waiting for more after each chapter! It had action,suspense and romance! I can't wait for the next book!!!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I really liked this movie , was inspirational and was just a really great movie. You can sit down with the family and just watch it has good points for kids to never give up
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I liked this movie. It was entertaining. Overall I'd say it was well worth the $3.99 rental. I'll wait until it gets cheaper before I buy it but I will add it to my collection eventually.
0765325950|4.0|The first impression turning the last page, is sadness. That's the end of an adventure started almost 20 years ago.<br />This book has done very well when you consider all the threads weaven during the 13 first books (I thought the &#34;vampire&#34; village was just a kind of &#34;filler&#34;, but no...). However, some stories or characters seem almost useless (Fain...). A wheel of Time with fewer characters, fewer threads would have allowed a easier ending weaving.<br /><br />Regardless of that, you have to read that book if you started the novel.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this series!  The acting was wonderfull, the directing was great and I loved the story. Just all around great TV.
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|i bought this to watch with a friend on campus and it was a pretty good movie, my friend LOVED it, im not too into these kind of films
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a constant in my life. So boring, I know, but I live in the mountains and need to know.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I like the games, but Ico is somewhat confusing as to why a Japanese style character is speaking something that sounds like French... ?
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This movie is so great that I just keep on renting because I used to have it but then I lost it for some unknown reason and I am too cheap to buy it again. But I will keep on renting because I love it that much!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great free app. for the Kindle Fire.  Easy to download & install, very easy to setup.  User friendly and the choice of alarm function, the various scheduling options cover just about any type of need.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Dowton Abbey!  I want all the episodes on my fire so I can watch them anytime I want.<br />I am presently recording part of season three.  I heard on Yahoo that Lady Mary might have a new man in season 4???  Am I missing something.  What happened to Matthew!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game just fun don't have to think hard.Use it all the time. Love that you can interface with Facebook and play on two seprate divices.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|British Comedy. Totally witty and charming. You have to watch it again to catch every little detail. These guys are hilarious. Shawn of the Dead was awesome too. I hope they keep making more movies like this because these are really enjoyable and great to rewatch. It is pretty timeless even though it is a few years old it is just as funny as it was when it came out. The bonus features are nice too especially for Simon Pegg fans.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|i chose this rating because although it was cute , it was not as good as the other ones, i would say wait for this one to be on the free list
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|If you liked the original film, this is a very different version of the classic. It is a bit dark but still great and visually stunning. Great for someone who thinks the original is a bit too cheesy for them, but still a family film for all ages. Check out the trailer it will give you a good sense of the film style.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It is indeed one of the best superhero movies ever. The fact that they somehow managed to give each character their time to shine is incredible on its own. Awesome action.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have been hooked on this game for years now. It has great replay value. Every time you play it is a different experience. It is not nearly as complex as some of the more challenging games. This game is for everyone. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes to play games with friends or family. You compete and cooperate as you play, making for an interesting play dynamic.
1616550414|5.0|It's great to see how the art has evolved over so many games of the franchise. It is an awesome compilation and it's a must-have for any Zelda fan.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Great sound, nice control buttons, but really annoying because they are not just plug and play as you would expect.  On a new Asus ROG gaming laptop I had lots of problems getting them to work, e.g. plug in the HUGE usb transmitter (which is really breakable by the way because its so long), turn on the headset...no sound.  Play around with sound settings, restart the game (Far Cry 3, amazing), restart the PC, whatever it would take to get it going.  Stop the game, use some other sound like music player...no sound again!  Unplug headset, try to use Skype without it...no sound on the PC now.  I'm returning them now but too late for full refund and don't want the hassle of claiming warranty.  PS: the around-ear design is obviously a choice of the user...for me they just get way too hot.  Sorry Logitech, I really wanted to like these.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the second book I have picked up in close to 6 years and I am so happy I did
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints! Couldn't seem to put this book down. Wonderful read from beginning to end. Look forward to his next book.
B00136NVH4|5.0|Classic classic rock. Meatloaf's Bat Out Of Hell with songs written by Jim Steinman, whose work in this album cemented his place in music,stands nearly 40 years after its release just as boldly now as it did then. Songs range from tender ballads to rough and tumble anthems. This was my first rock album purchase after hearing Two Out of Three Ain't Bad played on the radio. If you've ever lamented buying an album for a song and finding only that song worthwhile, don't worry; every song here is a classic.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Don't read this book alone; have one or more of your friends read it also, as you WILL want to discuss it with someone!  It is that kind of a book, generating many thoughts.  The story certainly keeps your attention, and has some intriguing twists.  As the plot revolves around a writer and books, if you love books you'll fall right into this.  I sent my copy from Charleston to a friend in Oklahoma who will send it to a sister and mother in California - you'll want to share this book.
B000I0QK74|5.0|His rendition of Have Yourself Merry Little Christmas really captures the feel of the lyrics.  Not crazy about the duet of Baby its Cold Outside but most of the other tracks were different in a good way.
B005K17RU0|3.0|All in all this is a good program. The temp is lacking in accuracy by up to 7 degrees. the weather maps are great and very informative as well as a number of the other functions. i use it in addition to Weatherbug. Between the two i get the information I need.
0930289234|3.0|This book has been on my to-read list since the movie came out (though I still haven’t watched the movie). Overall I enjoyed it, with a caveat or two.<br /><br />The art style is very traditional, which I appreciated.  It did take some mental work for me to solidify myself in the correct time period, especially when so much is referenced back in the 60s. Actually, it was the back story that interested me the most – I enjoyed reading about how each superhero got to where he (or she) was. In fact, I liked those parts of the books much more than the overall plot. The main conflict in the book got a little too big for its britches, and ultimately didn’t hold together for me. By the time I got to the final resolution, I was just ready to be done.<br /><br />Each graphic chapter of the novel is followed by something else – like a chapter from another book, a medical report, or a magazine article – that I guess is supposed to provide us with further back story. I liked these pieces at first, but after a while I realized that a good number of them didn’t do anything other than fill space. I outright skipped at least a couple.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I’m glad I read it, but more because of its place in history than anything else.
1451696191|1.0|Where do I start? Being once a15year old boy who smoked pot listened to the smiths and the cure I never recall in my writings sounding like a sheltered 10 year old. The fact he was 15 quoting dicken's but didn't have a clue about masturbating and then wrote like he was still in the 6th grade lost it for me.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It fits the Kindle Fire and protects it as it is supposed to.It does the job it is supposed to.The color is very good.
B000AA4JMU|2.0|This DVD did not come with the CD as advertised. My daughter was very disappointed and I felt mislead. I specifically bought this item because it was a DVD/CD combo.
B0095EMOTM|5.0|Bought this for my eleven year old. She loves it. Listens to it all the time. Even in the shower.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like using the batterie because it allows me to know how the devices batterie is doing and weather or not I have to charge it.
B002GYI9C4|1.0|I dabble in a lot of different genres, but I've been on a fantasy kick for the past two years or so. Game of Thrones, First Law, Rothfuss, that sort of thing. Nothing too weird--well, maybe China Mieville's stuff, but the guy is an amazing writer.<br /><br />Sanderson. Is. Not.<br /><br />Frankly, the guy does not know how to tell a story. There is no critical tension. No character tension. I don't give a rat's arse about any of the characters. Not one bit. The dialogue is awful and flat. The word choices are boring and lazy and uninspired. Positive reviews rave about &#34;his new form of magic&#34; but you know what? I would rather read about boring been-there, done-that magic sources within a book that contains an, y'know, interesting plot and characters and good writing, than have to read an entire book about &#34;burning pewter&#34; and &#34;flaring iron&#34;. Repetitive and dull. Anything slightly interesting is flattened by the atrocious writing.<br /><br />Did I mention I really don't care about the charactes? Cardboard. Any sort of backstory or plot twist is telegraphed from lightyears away. I love Patrick Rothfuss's writing, but I kinda want to punch him in the beard for convincing me to pick up this book.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Captivating! Great storyboard... well laid out and easy to follow. Quite believable and definately entertaining. Had us glued to our seats with excitement & joy. A real tearjerker!!!
B00621E94E|3.0|I just got into Lost a few months ago and it started out pretty good. Now I'm on the last season of Lost and I can tell you as the seasons climb my interest falls. It's like the writers ran out of things to write about...
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is one of the best fiction books I have read in the last few years. While it is probably classified as a mystery, it is much more than a whodunit. The characters are fully developed and you really start to care about them and sympathize with them. The writing is at the same time easy to read and thought-provoking. A real pleasure.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Not too many people know the whole story and all the different lands of oz. I love the details and the story
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I used to read every Nicholas Sparks book, but always got tired of him killing someone off in the end...though it is predictable, it is a good read.  And, there is a special twist at the end....makes sense.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|loved, loved, loved it. totally awesome and loved the concept of the movie, its what you think about doing yourself!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I want to just keep reading.  Once I'm rooting for one character, then I'm rooting for another.  You can connect with the characters easily.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|love this series, didnt see the first season on tv so was thrilled to get it here and watch it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This portrayal of life in England in the later 1800's is in my opinion without equal.  The acting is superb & the scenery, costumes, buildings, decor etc., should delight the most discerning of Anglophiles.  The penetrating eyes of Colin Firth & the captivating eyes of Jennifer Ehrl are memorable to say the least.  It's addictive!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I purchased the Kindle copy after reading the sample on Amazon and it truly peaked my interest. Besides an extremely interesting story told mostly through the eyes of the German Luftwaffe fighter pilot, Franz Stigler in his Messerschmidt BF 109, the reader is fully exposed to a full blown account of what it was like to be a member of an American B-17 (Ye Old Pub) bomber crew stationed in England with the 379th BG and their pilot Charlie Brown, We go along December 20, 1943 on their first unbelievably harrowing mission over Germany where their bomber is literally shot to pieces and as Charlie Brown fights to keep his ship flying he encounters a BF 109 just off his right wing. This part of the story is unbelievable and must be read to believed. You are introduced to the entire B-17 crew as individuals with personal feelings and backgrounds. Also you follow Franz Stigler's life which leads him into the early Luftwaffe, his time in North Africa where he becomes an ace and the difficulty dealing with the politics of the Luftwaffe. You learn that Franz Stigler is an unusual human being with a strong moral compass. Stigler escorts the bomber to the English Channel and Charlie Brown is able to limp home. Both pilots meet again in 1990 and the story on how they reconnect after 47 years is remakable. This is truly an unusual uplifting story which I highly recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Their wasn't a moment that in Season 3 that didn't......wanting more.  Around every corner I was captivated.  I found my self so drawn in that I felt apart of the drama that was unfolding especially in the Crawley's grief.  They can't 'win for losing'.<br /><br />Every Actor played their character, Superbly.  I can't wait till Season 4.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This movie is not your everyday movie, it's unique and quite precious. Our family sat down to watch this, and loved every bit of it. It's a tear jerker in a couple of parts, hehe. So cute though. We loved it!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Love lithos movie it was a valentine prest for my little girls they watch it and watch it! Hoe they come out for more
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very fun version of minecraft; it has all you expect from crafting, building, creative/ survival modes, etc.<br />The only thing that could make this game better is a cave generation system to make exploration truly fun (that and larger worlds).
B000NHQZ1S|3.0|This movie is not what I expected when I started watching.  One of those you kind of wait to see if it gets better or not.  Got it free on my Prime account.  Told my husband I see why it was free.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|This is the best bike mirror I have ever used.  It shows me everything I need to see behind me, is unobtrusive, and is very easy to attach.  I ride a recumbent bicycle.  I have 2 of them and I have Zefal mirrors on both.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Intriguing, had to purchase second season after watching the first season. I'm now thru with the second season and wait to watch the next episode, It's very addictive.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game to relax with and to challenge and sharpen your brain. I definitely recommend this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I can not see how any one can not like this game please get this app
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Where were you on Sunday February the 9th 1964, the Ed Sullivan Shoe.....It's the BEATLES!!!!! You had better get one of these...soon! You'll love it too!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this story because at the end Greg gets the chickenpox and how he lost his towel that was funny diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel is an amazing book
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Sinister is a horror movie about fear. Now while that sounds redundant it actually isn't. The fear is a different one then you might be used to. It's the fear of fading into obscurity, and the lengths someone will go to, to avoid this. The film shows a defiance of logic, to prevent the fade. Peppered throughout the film, are suspenseful moments, and some quirky characters. The movie is wonderfully shot, and lit. At times you will be peering into the darkness to see if you can make out the antagonist. The Super 8 footage looks awesome as well. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you have to see a horror movie in theaters go see this! It's an ORIGINAL movie! And at the end of the day isn't that better than seeing the 4th film in a franchise where someone will inevitably stand over someones bed? I tried to be spoiler free. After a long time a really good horror movie has arrived. Sinister was smart, unpredictable and scary. It also the right mix of gore and supernatural thrills. The story is very well developed and Ethan Hawke's performance as an self absorbed writer was praise worthy. All in all an enjoyable treat for horror movie buffs.<br />IS GREAT in PQ & AQ Awesome sharp lQQking blu-ray & Must to own for blu-ray/horror collector. real good flick & acted! A
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so well written I don't really like to read but the hunger games trilogy is great there was Times when I couldn't put it down!
1416550550|5.0|This book was phenomenal ... and a very intense read. The author bounces between characters and timelines nearly every chapter, occasionally leaving me confused, but this writing style really lends itself to the nature of the book. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend (my copy is actually on loan right now!).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horse looks almost real. It is really awesome. I used to go riding all the time and it brings back memories.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This film will elevate your blood pressure. The first 45 minutes is pretty much not stop white knuckle action - very well made, easy to suspend your disbelief. I hope it isn't an accurate look at commercial airline pilots, that would be very disconcerting!!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Every album that ever exists always has a song or two at least that is less than what you expected, you always skip it, and you just don't like it as much. This album is the exception. Every single song is beautiful, and the first time I listened through I was just blown away again and again as they played. Beautiful voice, beautiful music. I loved it.
1616550414|5.0|This really has everything for the Zelda lover. There is a wealth of information here. I particularly enjoyed reading the sections about making each title. Viewing original game docs and sprite sheets was incredible.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show.  Great acting, as well as a great story line.  The writers do a really good job.  It's very interesting to see how the British aristocrats lived back then, well at least the ones with an abundant heart and compassion.  I know they're fictitious, but hopefully there were many alike.  Definitely keeping me very intrigued and craving more Downton Abbey.  Bravo...<br /><br />And the video/audio quality is truly spot on.  I wasn't expecting as much, but the streamed picture was very clean and crisp.  And the streamed audio was equally as clean and clear.  All in all, I was very impressed with the quality of Amazon's Instant Video steaming of Downton Abbey.  Cheers...
B006LS7DQE|3.0|I have purchased and replayed the first one several times, but I have not been able to get as much into this outing. I'm not sure why, but this one isn't as good for me. Nothing wrong with the app as other reviews have said, but I just can't get into it like I did with the first game.
B00762DNIQ|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a fascinating depiction of life in North Korea, framed around the title character. By turns appalling, funny, shocking and sad - one can only hope that the poor people in that country are some day freed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This may just be speaking volumes about my nerdom, but this was one of the most entertaining books I've read in years. I sincerely hope cline doesn't take too long to release another book.
B009GEN0JO|3.0|Some fine performances, great settings. Somehow misses the mark a bit. The official series has more watch ability somehow. Glad I saw this, but no need to revisit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has interesting characters that are believable and well developed.  The plot is very good and  holds your attention.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Great movie from Disney that includes many catchy songs that my kids love. The movie does not have the great computer animations that the newer movies have but it still a classic that even young kids today enjoy.<br /><br />Would reccommend.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|The production value is much better than the first one and the &#34;upstairs&#34; crowd are more involved in the story line than in the original series. I watched all three back to back to back till 3 in the morning AND I had to work in the morning. Can`t wait till the next season.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|i bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas.  it was passed around and everyone had a great time trying to work it
B00112GVFO|4.0|I love this movie. It's a good mix of blow it up and funny. Good one liners and a decent plot.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book.  The characters came alive and the switch from present to past cleverly told the whole story.  Hard to believe the conditions in the orphanage and worse yet, the treatment of the children, but told realistically and accurately, unfortunately.  Loved the happy ending and promise of a great future for all.
1451627297|5.0|As someone who lived through that time period, I can relate to all the sights and sounds Mr. King paints in this book.  I also wondered, what if you could go back and try to stop the assassination from taking place. What would be the ramifications. This book gives you a possible senario to this. Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down.  Took me four days to finish. This is also a great love story as you'll find out when you read this.  I would say THE BEST book he's ever written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great way to pass the time! I am thinking of getting the ad free version ! Very adicting game!
B000003S0D|5.0|As a \\"baby boomer,\\" I grew up on the \\"British invasion.\\" I quickly realized however, there were a slew of bands and groups from England which were fueling introversion and introspection by utilizing an array of instruments, sounds, and orchestration, we hadn't heard before. The Moody Blues led us to ELP and in turn King Crimson. Some of us didn't go down this road because technically it wasn't traditional rock and we found it too abstract or complex.<br /><br />Early on, I think I was more interested in the album covers and di-ciphering their meaning than getting into the contents of the music within. I think I lost interest in King Crimson after ITWOP. While I did give Lizard a listen back then, after the initial track \\"Cirkus,\\" I thought it went downhill.<br /><br />Now some 40 years later, after re-listening to this album, I am truly blown away. Masterfully engineered, interspersed with jazz elements and hints of their early work, Lizard is a masterpiece and easily their best work. A must have for true KC fans.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|Soooo At first I was a little sketchy on purchasing this product, but it makes organizing my thoughts and writing easy...<br /><br />You can create a notebook for everything that you do, For example I have one for Recipes, one for A story I'm working on, and another to organize and catalog my thoughts and Ideas for the work that I do for Relay for Life... Each notebook can be titled, You can chose cover art for each note book (I do wish there were more options or that you could chose a pic from your kindle to use as a cover) You can chose the number of pages that each notebook has, as well as put a title on EVERY page of the notebook... which is ideal for Recipes and poetry...<br /><br />Would totally purchase this app again if I had too... &#60;3
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This show at first started out slow for me, but after a couple episodes I'm hooked! I love Downton Abbey...well  Lark Rise to Candleford has &#34;Bates&#34; as one of the main characters, so when I started watching I connected because I already knew a couple of the actors. An actress from Pride & Prejudice is also on this show. I am loving Lark Rise to Candleford!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Had to buy another recharge cord for my Kindle 2 because the original item fell apart. The white coating cracked off and this is not good. Was so glad I could get more (2).  Sometime things are discontinued and I love my Kindle 2. She is not as fancy as the new ones but she does the job. Thank goodness this is the perfect fit.  One other use for this product is that it fits my granddaughters cell phone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hate that I have to wait a whole year or the new episodes! Love, love, love this show!! I hope it never ends!!!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a fascinating and compelling read! Extremely well-written from the first-person, such that you can imagine you really are the unfortunate hero, Don. The pace of writing and carefully chosen sentence structure and grammar really transport you to Don's world.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Graeme Simsion comes up with next! Brilliant
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I enjoyed the game but sometimes it is too easy and then there's a ho that is impossible to see. Not much variety in scenes.  Action goes back and forth a lot.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|As a proud member of the Red Neck community myself, I laughed my rear off watching this movie. It may nudge out the &#34;Burbs&#34; as my favorite in this class of movies. Get ready for lots of Blood and Gore in a funny way if you can picture that. It does have the &#34;F&#34; word a few times which I could have lived without but no nudity. It allows me to laugh at what reminds me of &#34;One of my own neighbors&#34; without being offended. I think folks are to easily offended any more any way but that's just me. Wrapping it up, this movie allows you to laugh at yourself whether you are a Red neck Hillbilly or one of those &#34;Crazy College Kids&#34;. Enjoy.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love it . It is so awesome . Cooking with awesome. I would definitely read it again.<br /><br />Love it
B004GYY714|1.0|One star was the only star offered. I didn't hate it, I just didn't use it. I removed it shortly after down loading it. Really had no use for it
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Got here sooner than expected. No scratches and plays just like a new DVD would. I love this movie for a little under 2 dollars I was impressed!
0765325950|4.0|The Last Battle has arrived. The forces of the Light gather on the fields of Merrilor while Rand al Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, heads to Shayol Ghull to face the Dark One in a battle for the world. Perrin heads to the wolf dream to fight Slayer. Mat heads south, away from the upcoming battle, to the Seanchan troops in Ebu Dar to reunite with his wife. The Aes Seadi under the leadership of Amyrlin Egwene al 'Vere are prepared to throw all they have the behind the Dragon Reborn. Never has the world been so desperate and hope for survival depends solely on the outcome of Rand's fight.<br /><br />This book was full of action. And deaths. The Last Battle itself really does fill the majority of the book. There were several things I was happy to find out. Demandred's location was finally known. Several of Min's viewings come to pass and it was great to see Mat, Perrin, and Rand all fight on different battlefronts, each tailored to his own strengths. Yes there are some deaths. Quite a few actually. Of the three major character deaths, only one of them really surprised me. And the way that character dies is pretty awesome! Where all the loose ends tied up? No. But the major threads were tied up. And I'm ok with that.<br /><br />I read this book for pure pleasure. My thoughts and opinions are my own.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of fantasy, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson<br /><br />Rating - I've debated between four and five stars for this. Mainly because the 5 star reviews are trying to counter the 1 star reviews of it not being out on the Kindle right now. In my opinion it's really a more of a 4.5 star rating than anything else. So for amazon purposes, 4 stars.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|great story-- well written and Denzel washington is wonderful as  an actor as always-- beginning was a little slow but well worth the time=--
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I so like this game so much fun cant wait to play some more so addictive I play it all the time
B00A4Y9BT8|4.0|I've liked songs here and there by Rage.  This is the first time I've purchased any of their music.  I bought it because it was the right price for the right compilation of tracks.  I've been pleased with my purchase.
B008Y6WPXC|4.0|A must see action flix, even the stars are good so watch this and enjoy the movie. You will like it
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I fell in love with this movie.  I just had to own it.  When we have company and we want a good laugh, we put on Paul
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I am an avid watch user and have roughly 10 or so watches that I alternate between all of which average around $400 retail. I had flirted with getting Invicta watches before but never pulled the trigger on them because they are always \\"on sale\\" usually $500+ off the suggested retail price. With that said, I got this watch as a gift and love it. I'm a sucker for the large face watches that have extra dials and what not. It is a very nice looking watch but I wouldn't consider it the same quality as one of my name brand watches. Invicta is a lower end brand that \\"suggests\\" their products sell for $800, but then do crazy sales and end up selling them for $100. So don't be shocked by the sale price, it's all a marketing trick to get people to think they are buying a product that is equal in quality to the name brand. Again, this is a very nice watch for the price and I do like it a lot. I would not pay more then $100 though for any Invicta product, other people online will tell you the same thing... All in all, I am happy with the gift!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What can I say?  Humorous, educational, McGuiver on Mars, a suspenseful page-turner!  Sure, a few typos here and there, but nothing distracting or confusing.  I couldn't put it down, because the suspense was constant, from page 1 to the end.  Can't wait to find more from Mr Weir.
B00BESCUKK|4.0|Not bad for a Riza directed movie with of course some good woo tang music and some good martial arts action. Your girlfriend probably won't like it though, but your buddies will
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Beautifully filmed - amazing story and what an incredible man.  Can't help but be touched by his music and his spirit.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love this app for my smartphone.  Have my kind of music at my fingertips and don't have to carry any other device to use it.
B006BXT4TI|4.0|I like the album El Camino very much, but save yourself the extra $1 for the &#34;Digital Booklet&#34; because it's just photos of minivans and nothing else.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play this game every day to try to get to my highest rank.  It is very addicting and I highly recommend.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|What can I say? Beatles, LOVE, remastered for Cirque du Soleil, and a fantastic buy!  Enjoy enjoy enjoy.  It's not like the tracks you are used to.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|The stories were rich and moving. The journeys of the characters flowed like a river, and I gladly sailed along, eager to know what happened next. When the chapters changed characters and points of view I was slightly disoriented but before long I was sucked into the hopes and dreams, along with glimpses of the future, and then I felt the sadness as they looked back on what happened, what could have been. Shoplifter, music executive haunted by the hits that did not come, a sad man broken after his divorce and professional failure, a couple new to an upscale neighborhood and struggling to fit in (high school déjà vu?), death, and shame, just to name a few. I love the unique descriptions (Mindy's body is slender and elastic; she could slip through a keyhole, or under a door). It is odd and quirky in the beginning but if you continue and allow yourself to remain open it can be a wonderful book.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was a book club pick, and the blurb about the book sounded good. I was a little disappointed that I figured out the killer so early, but Flynn creates such oddball characters that it couldn't not be the one it is. The book did keep me reading to determine if my hunch was right.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Probably because it's about a serial killer. Great show. 5 stars. On to season 2 as Dexter cleans up Miami.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Not a longtime Bond fan, but this was an all around great movie.  Javier Bardem's villaiin is superlative - creepy, sympathetic, chilling.  Judi Dench is at her best.  And I want to see more of Daniel Craig.  Worth watching.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The James Bond series substantially deteriorated recently with Skyfall being the culmination. I cannot imagine myself wanting to watch the movie again and honestly any of 007 series anymore.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Being almost 60, I don't normally read young adult books; however, some younger cousins convinced me that this was one to read. It was exciting, well-written and held my interest throughout. As soon as I finished, I downloaded the next Mortal Instrument book for my Kindle. I will do the whole series and try to think of myself as a young adult from now forward.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was very impressed by this movie.  This movie is based on events which happened before my time.  After seeing the trailer, I had an interest, because to tell you the truth, the story of these 6 who were in hiding was one that I had never learned about in school or otherwise.<br /><br />The best part is that throughout, since I didn't actually know the story, it was intensely suspenseful.  I rented this movie tonight, and will certainly be considering adding it to my collection very soon.  A must see for people of all ages and generations.  Makes me want to learn more about not only these 6, and the 'Argo' program, but all the hostages who were held during the tough times.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Very moving story, and a page turner.<br />I raced through this just to see what happened next. I didn't want it to end.
B00553U3HM|5.0|Follett is a master of detail in the periods he rights,  He captures the times, opinions, societies ways, from class, wealth and mannerisms brilliantly then weaves historical events then a cracking good story around this.  Simply a great read, with some surprises and plenty of thrill that one expects of a master story teller.  Excellent highly rated.  If you are like me and read reviews first I am somewhat surprised with some of the negative comments.  Let me say this with confidence you can buy this as it will deliver a great read.  It also shows the perspective of a die hard loyal communist that in those times and era of beliefs are highly probable.  Buy and read with confidence I personally deliberated because some of the negative reviews which I found after reading was totally unfounded.  Enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a quality TV drama. I can not wait for next season to start. Thanks you BBC and PBS
B004S9AJXW|5.0|I must confess I was a bit worried to purchase to some of the negative reviews about character depth etc.  Totally unfounded.  Remembering this guy has woken up without his memory and has to piece it all together whilst time is ticking to a disaster dependent on him figuring it all out.  I will not spoil it but say.  Excellent read have no doubts this is a cracking great thriller, I wish I had read it earlier and disregarded some negative reviews.  Further it highlights Follett's brilliance as a writer of distinction in his genre and class. Fantastic plot with a lot of twists and turns very clever.  Highly recommend you'd be disappointed not to read it.  Do not hesitate to read, true page turner well worth the money buy with total confidence for an entertaining read.  :)
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This is such a wonderful film!<br />I love animated films and I love sweet stories, but I also like things a bit unexpected and bit unusual. This movie is all of those things!<br />I purchased this for my children because we loved the film so much. It was enough humor and action to keep them entertained and wanting to see it again, and enough design and creative prowess to keep the adults swooning. There are also beautiful and very cinematic segments of this film that really blow you away! It's quite exceptional!<br />I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed films like Coraline or who like their animated fare slightly above the ordinary!
B004S9AK7C|4.0|If your after an entertaining thriller this delivers this is a fun read!  Follett to the uninitiated is a great story teller with a great writing style one of the greats in our time.  After reading some of he more popular books I have been cautious to read his other novels.  But in truth I have not been disappointed.  This certainly delivered on all points.  I must say in response to a couple of poor reviews on probability at the end you'd be surprised and history has shown in the past how sometimes things seemed totally unreal like what this story is based on an impossible heist that actually took place.  I know for a fact from my background where breaches in security through dismissal of proper threat assessment or procedures due to extenuating circumstances have occurred by highly skilled professionals through arrogance in superiority of their skills.  Further, I have seen things as I'm sure at some point other people may have, where they have witnessed something extraordinary or stranger than fiction.  So in closing although it may push the envelop it certainly does not detract from the story and delivers one excellent read.  Fully recommend worthy of a read!
0670034711|5.0|I know I know. Everyone loves this book. It's every girls favorite novel. It's the ultimate chick-book and butt of so many sad lonely women jokes. But in all honesty, this is a really really good book!<br />I absolutely loved reading it and would really not hesitate to pick it up again.<br />The insights about life and love and LIVING that Gilbert lays down on the page here is just fantastic.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, read it. It's a wonderful, enlightening, uplifting, vivacious love letter to the world and everything in it! Just a magical read that touches on something really deep in your psyche that longs to feel more sometimes.
1451627289|1.0|Although I stuck it out to the end, this 800+ page book was as long and tedious of a read as the dictionary, but a lot less informative. In my opinion, a good book is one where the reader can't wait to find out what happens next. That never happened in this book. I bought this book because my Irish Catholic family loved the Kennedy's. This book is really nothing about the Kennedy's and only a little bit about Oswald really. The only thing I learned from reading this book is that Stephen King is a very radical liberal. Boring book!
0300169787|5.0|Beautiful beautiful beautiful.<br /><br />I was collecting McQueen pieces for a few years before his passing, and remember distinctly waking up to the news of his death. So devastating in so many ways. It was hard to digest as a serious fan and admirer, and was also hard to imagine the house continuing at all. Any successor named would surely seem to be heresy.<br />But Sarah Burton has taken the brand and really continued in the tradition we have all come to know and love. Naturally it is missing the hard edge and dark beauty that seemed to permeate many of the collections, but feminine beauty that is has been replaced with is definitely much appreciated and loved!<br /><br />This book is a beautiful tribute to the designer and his work and a must own for any fashion fan and especially any McQueen fan.<br />No other published homage even comes close a this point. This is the defining tome.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've had four of the Angry Birds series and this one (Rio) is the best in several respects including: artwork and colors, smooth movement of objects, great animation, not forcing me to see unwanted commercials.<br /><br />I use it on a 10 inch tablet. I called my wife to come look at my new Angry Birds and her first remark was, &#34;Oh, it's in 3d.&#34; I told her that it isn't 3d, it is the artful use of colors and construction.<br /><br />I've had the Rio version for several days and I play it every evening.<br /><br />Thank you for Rio. Job well done!
0810989956|4.0|I personally don't get these books. They're so simplistic and I don't even find them engaging or entertaining but kids love them.<br />Both of my sons and all of their friends go nuts for these books, and I guess I just have to accept that I'll never really accept why.<br />I guess it might be a bit of the thrill of reading someone's 'diary' or maybe it's just the simple drawings that kids can replicate, I don't know.<br />But if you have an elementary school aged boy in your house, chances are this would be a winning purchase for you!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I do not like the fact that it does not give you and weather statements, the icon only turns red.  Not very helpful.
0439023483|5.0|I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. I purchased it to read before giving it to my son to read to make sure it was age appropriate and that he could handle the content.<br />I found that I literally could not put the thing down and finished this in a day!<br /><br />And absolutely marvelous world is created here and you are really pulled in! The characters are so uniquely themselves and they truly are beautifully realized n the page. Yu care for them and root for them and want them to succeed and win and that in itself is such a success!<br /><br />The concept is wonderful, and is filled with enough subtext to keep adults interested and thinking as well as enough drama and action to keep the younger readers thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />I'm always wary of blockbuster young adult books because it seems they can fall so short sometimes, but this one really hits it so far out of the park it's amazing. Especially since this is just really stripped down, bare bones story telling. It reads so simply it would be easy to dismiss, but the thought and attention to detail paid to the entire environment and the characters in them makes this a phenomenal read. It's going to be a standout for this generation for sure.
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|Sinister is not the worst horror/thriller I have ever seen nor is it the best. The sets were just so poorly lighted. Who eats dinner in a pool of light with complete darkness in all the other rooms? I always enjoy Ethan Hawke, but the actress playing his wife was not a good match for him at all. And her British accent just added to the lack of chemistry. The jump out at you moments are created by someone playing a chord on a keyboard and amplifying the volume to eardrum piercing levels. Even my dogs were bothered by the sudden screeching sounds. It works for the first or second time but after that you start to expect the amplified sounds. There is a twist at the end but I figured it out about 30 minutes before the end.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Oh Ninjago. You have consumed my children's minds and bedroom floor space.<br />And I kind of don't mind.<br /><br />This set is really astoundingly beautiful once it's assembled. The temple slides open and closed and the dragon perches on the second level and it's really an impressive display!<br />It's somewhat challenging to put together, but is so worth it! I love everything about it, right down the cherry trees in bloom!<br />My children have been obsessed with Ninjago since it first came out and when they received this set I nearly lost my hearing from the shrieks of joy. If your child - or you! - are a fan of the series this is a set you need to invest in. It's magnificent and I can't overstate that.<br />Also impressive in size when completed as well, so make sure you have a good chunk of table space or a lot of shelf space to keep it!<br /><br />It's pricey, but the amount if entertainment and joy this has brought my family truly is worth every penny!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|When you can't get to sleep White Noise will definitely help with lots of noises to get you drowsy.  It;s a wonderful tool especially when on the road and in a hotel room with strange sounds.  It has many sounds to choose from and you are sure to find one to soothe you.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Mma Ramotswe - a true heroine in an intriguing part of the world whose tales will leave you craving for ever more of her entertaining adventures in crime and mystery.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|the book presents science fiction characters that we all know don't exists and live in a story just too hard to believe!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I agree with everyone else.  I can't see recent posts.  I am removing it from my device.  I am in search of a replacement app.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Got this to record my grandbaby's giggle. Recorded the giggles AND a full blown laugh. i was able to set it as my ringtone so i look forward to phone calla for a change. And anytime i'm feeling down i play it to get a smile. Haven't tried it for anything else yet.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone. Bit of history with great story. great great great
B000BYACOY|5.0|The cd was the one I had hoped for........unlike the picture above.  The picture used to sell this item should be changed to more accurately illustrate the item being delivered.  The picture should include the one with Charles Bronson sitting on a wooden fence.  Thank you!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good game finding things weren't so small you couldn't. Find them puzzles were medium could have been a little more challenging. Overall good
B007BVOF8E|5.0|I loved this movie...Gary Oldman is superb....I thought that he was the best in Dracula but no....he just toped it here with this movie. I loved the story, the character development; you \\"can't trust anybody\\" and it is just so interesting....loved it...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun!My favorite person is Scarlett Fox. I like the longer ropes for more coins:) I love the tunnels too.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I find the puzzles challenging and fun.  I like that you can progress the intensity of the puzzles.  Such Fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cool.<br />it is so addictive.I love it so much.<br />I totally recommend this app.I love it.I love it. I love. I love it.I love it.I love it so much.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Very good production values and special effects, great characters and dialog.  Streaming quality was very good.  I have enjoyed it so far, not done with the first season yet.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Beautifully written, a book I wasn't sure I would love.<br />Neat little plot about doing the things we should, even when we are not quite sure why.
1439152802|4.0|really enjoyed this book. kept me in suspense until the very end. a little slow in the beginning but then i could not put it down. look forward to reading more kate morton novels.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids at various age levels find it entertaining and challenging as well. I also find myself trying to keep up with them. I would get this again in a heartbeat!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|As I anxiously await the next book's debut we're catching up on the series.<br />I<br />Love<br />It.<br />Well done, HBO.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a good read.  Had love & suspense and kept my interest.  I had a hard time putting it down.
1881273377|5.0|I purchased the CD instead of the book so that i could listen to it while i was driving to and from work. This book definitely give you a different outlook on the things you do for your partner and helped me open my eyes to see that not everyone has the same views. This would be a great book for a coupe or single person that wants to learn ways to better their relationship or maybe try to re light the fire back into the relationship. Definitely something that both male and female should listen too so that you can get on the same page with things and learn to understand each other. It's not something that would work being a one sided thing, but it is really good information.
B005HS4CUY|4.0|These are just cute movies I love. The combo set is great when you are limited on space. Great to have around if you have children or have friends with children.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I purchased this product because of the particular songs that were on it but now I'm so pleased to have discovered this very talented artist who beautifully delivers the music I enjoy so much.  Emmy:  your music has brought listening pleasure into my home.  Thank you.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|My wife and I started watching this series and now we are totally addicted to it.  We have now watched all three seasons and we watched this season 2 using our Amazon Prime account.  This show is simply the best TV show on television today.  It features a little bit of everything from love, war, hate, rich, poor, suspense and even possibly murder.<br /><br />This season features 9 episodes and each one is enjoyable and entertaining.  Once you start watching them you will not be able to stop.  I will not go into any of the plot or story line but I will say that the storyline, acting, cinematography and directing are right on.  It amazes me how good this show is and it just confirms to me how bad American TV has gotten.<br /><br />This is another fine example of excellent British TV drama that is professionally done. I highly recommend this series to you; just expect to get addicted to it.<br /><br />We watched these on Amazon Prime for free with our Prime service and I was amazed at the quality of the streaming.  The series came through in HD and there was not one glitch in video or sound.  We watched season 3 streamed from another source and there were several episodes that were very bad.  Amazon performed well for us using Prime.  I also liked that they streamed the original UK version of the series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is wonderful!  The story is full of humor and feeling.  Touches on a subject (mental illness) that is difficult to convey, but the author does it in a beautiful and creative way.  Don't be fooled by the hype over the movie...barely the same story, and the characters are unrecognizable.  Stick with this great, quick read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun for lovers of horses...great time killer...I find this title very addictive.  Loads of fun.  Love the challenges and filling up the stable.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|I love this movie, however, at times the sound has to be increased to hear it.  I still love this movie.
1439196834|5.0|It's really amazing the creativity inside this book. I'm really willing to try some moves in real life, lol .
B000P8V8EY|5.0|this is my favorite movie. it is the best movie ever. i love this movie so much. everyone should watch this movie.
143911000X|5.0|Great book, I laughed with every page of this book. I Truly recommend for those who like HIMYM and those who likes Barney. It's a must have for fans of the series
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This had me very interested from beginning to end and it was a great series to read. Would recommend to anyone
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I've enjoyed this series immensely. There's always twists and turns that keep it edgy. I wouldn't suggest it for the very young, partly due to adult content, violence and gadgetry that is over their heads.
B00BHMF578|1.0|Movie kept buffering could not watch it. would like to know what I need to watch the movie. looked like a great movie.
B00797MB0O|4.0|I wavered between 3 or 4 stars, this movie was well done-though not up to previous Reitman standards. Charlize's character was awful, horrible, a train wreck of moral decrepitude. And I couldn't take my eyes off her. Afterwards, I was mildly depressed by it. But, I found myself remembering parts of it over and over. And that is one of my hallmarks of a good movie. Charlize Theron gives a performance that is completely fascinating and her talent is tremendous to pull this one off. I think I might want to watch this one again....
B00271B752|5.0|I didn't know it was based on a real story until after I saw it. It turned a good movie into a great one. One of Pacino's best.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|While I always like to have fresh flowers in the house, I am lousy at arranging them.  This story got my attention right away when I found out that different varieties have meaning! OMG some of my favorites aren't just a pretty face!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Well done show one of the best series for TV with good acting and good plot and a nice flow.Everyone seems to love the series.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I bought it because I had heard the single &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; on YouTube and loved it.  The rest of the album is pretty good too.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Again, this is my grandsons game. He really enjoys it. Plays it quite alot and really gets into it. I'm satisfied
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Really like the app.  Don't like being forced to review it.  I use it every night and am pleased with it.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I like a good Mahjong and this one was up there.I like games that make you think. Good for the brain.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Disappointed in the thrust of this movie. Nudity in your face,drugs and alcohol with nothing redeeming to it. Gave up on it and but wished for something better from Denzel and crew. This is a very vulgar movie.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|I paid to disable the ads and a day later I have ads again and am being told I need to pay again in order to disable ads. Seriously? What is this? Extortion by Zeptolab? I don't care that it's only 99 cents, everyother day that would add up. Nice. I'm so fed of with the constant ads I'm going to remove it from my kindle. It's too bad, it's a good game and my four year old grandson loves it.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I liked traditional angry birds, since, as humans, we are all familiar with basic physics involved in flying or launching things.<br /> But the screens in space, where you get sucked in by various vortexes and gravitational fields is just annoying. I quit the game as soon as this is encountered. Don't attempt to tell me how gravity fields work - I know well how they work. In your screens nothing so small would ever have so much &#34;pull.&#34;
B0095P29EG|5.0|Thor is a great fantasy movie and I like the message for Thor to demonstrate being worthy of his powers.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|same as my review for Angry Birds space. Gravity fields sucking you in various directions - just stupid. And annoying.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I am completely addicted to this game! It's like 3D Mahjong on steroids. I love the bright colors and challenging yourself to beat your time. Sometimes in turning the cube, it moves a bit slow which affects your time. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But still a great game!
B0040X46TE|5.0|GREAT SOULFUL MUSIC THAT RETURNS YOU TO THE WONDER OF THE ISLANDS. WE WILL LISTEN TO AND SHARE THIS WITH MANY FRIENDS.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This movie is so full of action and finger biting moments...I just loved it and as soon as TAKEN 2 came out ,I bought it too.
0307352153|1.0|Several political messages in this book.  The author is without doubt a liberal Democrat.  I was very disjointed when she used Al Gore as a example of a introvert who couldn't get his message across on global warming.  Her research falls short on a lot of her points.  She fails to mention the fact that he has been cashing in on his little crusade for several years now.  And she seems to have no knowledge of carbon credits...  I just wish authors that wright a book like this would keep it to the title of the book and not put political spin on it either to the left or the right.  It is very discrediting and unprofessional.  I am sure she will be invited all the Gore kids weddings.  For the record I am an independent and pretty much think all politicians are opportunists and scum.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I'm a movie buff and I for what ever reason missed this movie when it first came out, so when I ran into the reviews on Amazon, I thought sounds good to me; so I purchased the dvd, and liked it quite a bit.  I liked it enough that I will most likely see the sequel at the theatre.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It says its updated but when I go in it on my android tablet it isn't updated I hope you fix it
B006IYG5HE|2.0|I started with an early Harry hole by recommendation.  A mistake.  A  more seasoned  Harry  would have been  a  much better choice.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I downloaded this movie for a flight I was about to take. It was available for $1.99 so I thought that was a great buy!  I found it to be very entertaining and loved the dancing! I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in dance & romance. Definitely a good chick-flick!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Each episode and each season get more interesting, vibrant, life like, involved, and complicated. This is hands down the best show currnetly on television.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Although I don't know that all of the twists contained within season three are going to pan out, it has been a riveting season thus far and has definitely kept me coming back for more every week without fail.  I do like how the story follows what I would think, psychologically, would happen in a post-zombie apocalyptic world in that people who deal with them regularly become almost desensitized to the zombies themselves, they simply become a hazard to avoid and the real dangers come from other survivors, who aren't mindless drones.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw this movie the day it came out. Later that night, I knew I had to read the book. Though they were literally nothing alike, I loved this book from the first page to the last. It is so moving, and you begin to believe you're truly living through all of Katie 's hardships. Truly amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is totally worth the money.  It is a great book.<br />The book has tons of suspense and is full of tons of emotions from fear to happiness!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I bought it because I heard it was similar to 50 Shades. I read it front to back in a day and a half. A very good storyline and an easy read. I already bought the second one and have the third preordered . If you like 50 Shades you will like this series as well. Highly recommended
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It was funny but not as funny as most people made it out to be. To me it was mainly a love story with some humor thrown in. Iwas expecting better.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book you can make is awesome and this is a good first diary of the wimpy kid the fourth
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I have watched all the movies and by far this was the worst one. It looked promising from the trailers but once I started watching it I just wanted to turn it off it was so boring.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the hunger games trilogy! Like the other two books, everything is unexpected! This was another nail-biting page turner.
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of fun - normally I can't get a break at work, but this gives me a reason to get away from my desk!  I can take a break, slice & dice and up by best score!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor is a great game. It has great graphics and is easy to play and is addictive. I could play for hours at a time.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was not very interested in the premise of the film at first, but fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence and her work.  She is magnificent and makes this film, even if the plot is not that appealing to your ideals or values.  The film has such conflict between the concept of killing for survival and then experiencing the trials and tribulations of competing in the District Games.
B008469DGY|4.0|loads of fun and looks great, just needs a full 9 or 18 holes.  Hard to put down once you start.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you have ever been young and in love and had a &#34;different&#34; kind of family life, this is your movie.  It is reminiscent of every person who ever had a young crush and dreamed of having a &#34;different&#34; family when they were growing up.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|great way to get that song you like when you like a song and have no idea who sings it.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|fun and challenging, hard to put down.  different games and you can chanllenge yourself over and over and lover again.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|more birds, can't get enough birds. angry birds hit it right on the head with this game and all their other games. There different in their own way and fun.
B007M45PMU|4.0|My son says this is sissy music, but I have enjoyed it more each time I listen.  I don't know who half the music performers are out there now and just happened to catch the 2013 Grammys and liked the Lumineers  performance.  I got this CD and my husband got Mumford and Sons.  We like them both and are going to try to keep up with what current music better.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|really really fun hard to stop but would be a 5 if you could play a whole 9 or 18 holes.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app does what is says and does it very well. I have a couple of office apps installed and usually use this app to read my PDF files. If you read a lot of PDF files, get this app, you will not be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is the best! Everytime I turn on my kindle I go straight to the game! :D You should totally  get this awsome app!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fast-paced fun will keep you running! Beware though, you WILL GET HOOKED! The free tournaments are a hoot! If you like Bingo, you'll love this version.
B008133JZG|5.0|This is just a fascinating show; it's not your father's Sherlock Holmes!<br /><br />I'd put it in a class with the best series ever made, also by the Brits, \\"Life on Mars!\\"
B000W21ER4|3.0|If you're not a huge Weezer fan this album is still worth picking up.<br />Not every song is a hit, but it's good enough to where i don't regret buying it.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Excitement at first, then movie develops Denzel's character. Thought provoking regarding ethical and legal implications of someone occupying position of responsibility, specifically safety of others, while faced with personal battle with alcohol/drug dependence.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A physics based game with heart.  The player needs to have some thinking skills and be able to understand a little, a very little, about how things are constructed and what will make them fall most easily.  One doesn't really have to care about the angry birds or their various plights, but the snarky laughter of the pigs or monkeys -- let us call them the villains -- when the level fails, is pretty galling.  You want to &#34;get them&#34;.  It's a lot of fun!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My son is fascinated by this snail. He isn't crawling yet, so he hasn't watched it move. However, he loves to hit it and hear the songs and the lights. Additionally and probably most important, the songs don't drive me nuts!
1169253105|5.0|If you've ever wondered what &#34;thinking outside the box&#34; really might look like, read one chapter of this little book.  His thoughts on insanity are priceless.  Chesterton was a Catholic and he was a THINKER.  No matter what you may believe, this book will give you more food for all your thoughts.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read this because as all stories, there must be an end. I actually didn't like this book as much as the first two, but that is more because I didn't like some of the things that happened! All in all, it was a fitting end to the horrors of The Hunger Games and everything in between.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the same genre as Angry Birds:  physics based fun.  A little monster eats candy and the player has to feed him by cutting strategically placed ropes and obstacles at the right time.  When I tried it the first time, to see if I wanted it for my grandkids, I was hooked in the first three levels -- then went on to play for another hour!  I had to keep reminding myself that this is for children and, yes, I really should be able to get all the stars....  Just try it.  It's great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely better the Twilight, first off, and probably up there with Young Author greats like J.K. Rowling. I truly enjoyed the experience from Book 1 to Book 3! Read them all!
B006N57PXG|4.0|Essentially what the title says.  The most interesting thing about the books is the treatment of morality.  None of the characters are particularly good, nice, kind, or in favor of justice.  In an overcrewded market of &#34;do the right thing&#34;, this book chooses not to.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this on my kindle when travelling.  I also use it during my commute (public transit) to block out background noise so I can read or do work without distraction.  Several choices for sounds, and the timer is a nice plus.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|User friendly and great for horse lovers that can't have a real horse, could also be used to let kids see that taking care of a horse is more work than most realize
B008XG1X18|3.0|loved it never had a problem until a few days ago it forced closed and have not been able to get back on
B00B2166BS|3.0|The charger is great with the exception of the magnet strength and cable length. The cable could be another foot or two, and the magnets are kind of fragile. If they just upgraded those two things it would be perfect.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I like the ability to do just a 5 min workout here and there. I don't have time to do a full 30 minutes with a new baby, but this app is perfect. Also nice that it has lots of options to keep things interesting.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I knew there would be off color stuff but not like this. I was hoping for a cute fun comedy not a manual in color on different ways to do it , times and partners. The conclusion of the movie was satisfing but the off color jokes and gay activity was uncalled for and tasteless. It was a waste of my life and I  regret having had seen it! Poor taste.
B004UUKD6W|4.0|great album. One of my early purchases that was transferred to cassette. hope everyone remembers that old medium. LP's ,45's
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first played it, I didn't think too much of this game.  It seemed like it get really repetitive really fast...but I'm hooked!  Easily the game I play most often on my Kindle.
B00000DFSK|4.0|when the cd arrived i put it in the stereo and listened to the whole thing. i wasn't dissappointed. one track is in super fast mode, but for what i paid i can live with it.
B0086700CM|4.0|The only trouble with this game is that they released Temple Run 2...which is even more fun! If you like this, get temple run 2!
B005PK56TA|4.0|I loved the series because it was unpredictable and crazy.  A few of the episodes were a little too crazy, but I still liked it.  Can't wait to catch up on Season 2 when I have time.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|It is a great bumper, i love it, but the Price was a little too high when i bought it
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Most people are not aware of the event. I recommend everyone read it.  Get your kindle out.
B00AB0NTTI|4.0|Very entertaining and if you know your murder mystery literary characters, a jab-a-minute dialogue. Well acted, good story and plot.  The actors seemed to be enjoying their roles and were perfect for their roles.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm generally pretty easy on things, and I will be on review of this product.  If George Lucas feels compelled to keep working \\"his masterpiece\\", then so be it.  We have no control over it.  I think George would serve himself well by leaving well enough alone, and concentration on ensuring the masters are transferred over at as high a quality as possible.  He doesn't need to re-work content.  It's my sense, the general public is fully happy to see these flicks again as they originally saw them in the theater, and enjoy them for what they are - and that would be as a \\"really incredible story\\" that for some has changed people's lives.<br /><br />Having seen all the originals in the theater when they were originally released, I will say this.  I ordered this package of movies and started showing these to my children last night.  I was VERY confused when I put the first disk in only to discover it was \\"The Phantom Menace\\", and that the original, first movie had mysteriously been re-named, \\"A New Hope\\".  That really threw me.  And so as TPM ran on my Oppo Blu-Ray player, I decided to let it run for the kids for a while, since this really was \\"the real beginning of the story\\".  But what I quickly realized was, they really needed to see \\"A New Hope\\" first if they ever expected to really understand what was going on, and what \\"The Force\\" was all about.  So I really think Mr. Lucas has done a disservice here by specifying the disks be put in this \\"chronological\\" order.  If you really are new to Star Wars, you should actually start with Disk IV, then watch V and VI, then go back to I, II, and III.  So it seems some confusion has been created here.  There's no way you can really understand everything that's going on in Disk \\"I\\" until you've seen Disk \\"IV\\".<br /><br />So I complain.  I'm not a Star Wars Fanboy, so I can't get too wrapped up in the other small changes Lucas has made that really amount to nothing more than nuances in the story.  I'm more interested in the grand sweep of the entire series, and would suggest that Star Wars is Star Wars, and still the grand epoch that it always was, only with better video quality and better sound.  Enjoy the movie.  It's great in its orginal or altered form because it's just a spectacular story and spectactular movie, and no minor changes Lucas makes can really ruin it.

055380684X|5.0|Absolutely love this book! Easy to read, lots of research, well-explained. 10,000 hours as a theory makes so much sense.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|This book was hard to put down as I got into it. Some parts were hard to read because of the graphic details involving torture. The images they provoked were difficult to erase. The plot provided continual surprises and kept me guessing. I really wanted to know how everything turned out at the end so i spent more time reading!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing. It'll keep you turning pages. I'm anxious to finally read the others as well. YOU HAVE TO READ IT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read every Nicholas Sparks books and this one didn't disappoint me either. So if you like his twist on things you will love this book as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was more than just a love story. I might like to see the movie now.
1451696191|5.0|I bought this for my College Sophomore English Composition class but it was actually an addictive read! I read it in a couple of days and couldnt put it down.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|A simple uninstall and reinstall fixed the upgrade not installing properly (Sprint Galaxy S3 running Cyanogenmod 10.1) Doubt the setup had any impact on the solution. A  simple uninstall then reinstall will usually fix these types of issues.<br /><br />I've used the app for a couple of years and is continually gotten better the one thing I wish you would add would be the ability to  record podcast for later listening or when I don't have that good of a signal.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|True story about a kid chasing his dream.  Very touching. Great movie to watch with the whole family.  Would recommend for everyone.
0307730697|5.0|I really can't believe that one ordinary guy could overcome some much hardship, even to the point of losing body parts, and attain one of the highest levels achievable in an SOF unit. Truly inspiring! My heart goes out to Adam's family, friends and Team-mates for such a tragic loss.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recommend this bible app to everyone. It is rich in resources and easy to use. The ability to compare various translations, quickly, is a real blessing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is addictive...one doesn't know when to stop!  It's an excellent passtime and brain teaser.  The smaller grids are excellent for children, and the larger grids are challenging for adults.  Perseverance is required to find the right pathway.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|i hate this product with a passion but  like they say you get what you pay for this thing literally lasted me 1 week before it broke DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
B004PGNB1K|4.0|I like the gener very much!!I chose it because I had read the first one.900 and more pages and I could not put it down.It is a story with everything in it.I can't wait for the third one!!!!I do not want to say anything about the book so as not to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.The Kindle edition does not have any problems,though a few mistakes I did notice.Have fun!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app for the music lover who enjoys a taste of tunes from around the globe. The search mode is user friendly. I particularly enjoy searching by location. Perfect for listening while daydreaming of places traveled or sampling cuts from radio in your old hometown.
B003HV0TN2|4.0|I chose it because I like the gener very much.I liked it because it was fresh.It has a whole world in it.The hero is not always the good,happy,innocent guy.He is a child who had to grow suddenly.He is a child who does make mistakes and takes risks and you always think that something will happen to him because he acts impalssively which is not always good.I think whoever likes this kind of literature will be very much satisfied and will buy the second volume as soon as this one is finished..!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is excellent. Great story line and the actors are phenomenal. This is a must see for those who want to watch a program with substance. This is art at its best. I just found out about it so I am beginning with Season 1. I am going to be so sad when I am done! You may not think you like British television. But this will change your mind for sure.
B000X1MCTI|5.0|Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? by Dr. Seuss<br />Illustrated very colorful children's book showing you what Mr. Brown can do.<br />He can act and sound like so many silly combinations of animals it's truly a joy to read this because<br />it will leave you laughing so hard... Great for a rainy day.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Although it seems like we have to wait a considerable amount of time between each of Josh's CD releases, I'm always very excited to discover what he's put together each time.  His new CD, &#34;All That Echoes&#34;, is my new all time favorite from him and I believe it has more to do with how it feels as if he's taken his time to really present the type of song/sound he is the happiest with.  As a result, I continue to feel as if we're now getting to hear the &#34;real&#34; Josh Groban and not just a singer that is producing yet another formulaic product for the masses or a product that someone else has told him he &#34;should&#34; do.  No, his type of music is not necessarily going to appeal to everyone, but for those of us that do enjoy it, the wait has been well worth it.  It's nice to see that he's co-written much of what he's given us w/this CD and I also love hearing his version of &#34;older&#34; songs such as &#34;The Moon's a Harsh Mistress&#34; (I'd personally love to hear him do more Jimmy Webb as he seems to be able to interpret JW's songs beautifully!) and &#34;Falling Slowly&#34; as well as the traditional &#34;She Moved Through the Fair&#34;.  I originally purchased the regular CD, but then when I learned that he was offering a Deluxe edition through Target that had an additional 4 songs on it, I gave my original purchase to a friend and bought the Target version.  The additional songs are great as well ... &#34;Grazie&#34; and Neil Diamond's &#34;Play Me&#34; stand out for me in particular.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is great. It isn't full of filler. A lot more good songs than just Thrift Shop. Macklemore isn't a joke rapper.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|If you haven't heard Tommy Emmanuel, do yourself a favor and get this DVD.  He is amazing.  Very fast, very talented and very funny.  Great show.  I will eventually buy all of his stuff.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|I can relate to this movie alot. Only because I am currently feeling the same way that Natalie's character is feeling. Hopefully...this is just a short lived phase.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great except you can't transfer game between devices. You have to start over again. It is fun enough that I am starting all over again.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love description of heaven. Interesting about his family, disease and recovery. This book is good for everyone especially people with doubts of heaven.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers debut song HoHey doesnt show much range for the album alone but was an instant hit due to its upbeat inviting \\"sing along with us\\" vocals. Wesley Schultz (the lead vocalist) takes you through his folk style songwriting giving each song a storyline of its own.  Buying this album will not disappoint as it has a mesh of some of the greatest folk sounds of the 60's brought to life and transformed into an album that everyone can appreciate. Personally I love this album an d their style it has a very happy mood altering affect on me reminding me of my elementary summers and listening to records with my dad.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun I loved the powers that you can get the game was great especially the spray paint bottles and the moving trains. It was funny when the guy who is chasing you catches up to you and you purposely run into the train.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|The App gets me to the site to make contact to anyone in the business for information that I need for my Business.<br />I would recommend it yo anyone in Business or even anyone that wants to keep a contact list for contractors to do repairs needed.

B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Great live performance.  Sound is not as good as in a studio, but good enough to show how good he really is in person.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very different type of story than the usual, with lots of twists and turns.  For a number of chapters, I could not figure out what was happening:  how is this related to the story?  Ha!  The plot just kept getting more complicated!<br /><br />A great read!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Downloaded the app to attempt to play video files downloaded from my pc on my kindle fire.  app required an additional driver that I was unable to download even though it said it was compatible with my device.  if I can find a way to make this work then I will change my rating.  however, for now this was a waste.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series from Masterpiece Theatre is one of the best ever. Great actors and formidable script. What's not to like?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I want to take the time to thank Mr. Howey for such wonderful stories, after reading a truly dismal book by another author, I found I was remiss in not leaving feedback for such a talented Indie Author. I apologize for not writing sooner. After reading Wool, I went back and read everything else he has to offer and have never been disappointed.<br /><br />This series does a wonderful job of creating a story of humanity, with all of our faults and strengths. I hope to continue to find such shining stars in the self published world. You can truly loose yourself in the stories he creates.<br /><br />Thank You!

Although some people complain about this series, saying it had run on sentences and was hard to keep up with. I had no problem keepng up with this series or reading this series. Plus you do not read books for grammatical correctness you read them for the story and I believe this series had a good story.
