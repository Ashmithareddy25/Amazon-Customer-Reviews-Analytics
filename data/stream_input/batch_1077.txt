B00003CX9E|1.0|I came into this movie with high-expectations. I really wanted to like it. I forced myself to sit through the entire thing. By the half-way point though, I could not wait for it to be over. It may have been a great movie in its time, but seems really slow moving and dry by today's standards. I just couldn't get into it, and I really can not understand what the hype is about. I'm only 22, so if you are a bit older than me, you may love it-- from the reviews it seems that most people do-- but I just can't see any one in my generation actually appreciating it.

B003TEO3EI|5.0|It's funny - I like this album more than \\"A Twist in the Myth\\" but I don't think it is as consistent.    I want to give this four stars compared to more dense and heartfelt albums by Blind Guardian such as Imaginations or Nightfall, but it's so far above and beyond any other band in the genre that it's still a 5-star album. The songwriting is executed with Blind Guardian's traditional care and superior sensibilities, and the whole experience is delightful.    I'm also glad I sprung for the physical 2-disc set instead of just getting the digital download or something. It was fun to open, and I love the shiny material it is printed on and enjoyed looking through the art in the lyric booklet. The second disc content is nothing to write home about, but is somewhat interesting.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|Its a good concept of how there is always stories about Aliens landing on earth hundreds of years ago, why i find unrealistic is that this alien already knows how to fight with swords and spears but yet he is an person with extraterrestrial weapons, where did he learn how to use swords and medieval weapons, the ending was very interesting.

B003VS0CX8|4.0|THE SOUND OF MUSIC tem sido o musical mais bonito que assisti dezenas de vezes em toda minha vida, seja pela estoria envolvente e light, pelo visual magnifico da Austria, pelas musicas inesqueciveis, pela presenca carismatica de Julie Andrews e dos filhos do Capitao Von Trapp ,enfim, por tudo, EXCETO pela qualidade 5 stars da imagem em Blu-ray, que apesar de very crisp, muito nitida em todos os aspectos, peca pelo excesso do desagradavel ruido de imagem (film grain in excess), que no mesmo DVD que acompanha o BD tal ocorrencia foi tremendamente reduzida, quase imperceptivel na maioria das cenas. Tambem o som DTS-HDMA 7.1 deixa muito a desejar em termos de sinal de audio, o que prejudica a sensacao de dinamica sonora. Podem verificar o que estou dizendo por simplesmente comparar o Blu-ray THE SOUND OF MUSIC com o magnifico  Blu-ray CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, cuja qualidade da imagem deste ultimo ultrapassa tudo o que tenho visto em termos de restauracao de filmes antigos (old picture restauration), totalmente film grain free - nenhum ruido na imagem para nos distrair da estoria do filme, que tambem recebeu um excelente som DTS-HDMA 7.1 (very good DTS-HDMA sound), servindo este filme CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG como referencia absoluta no quesito restauracao de bons filmes antigos. Mesmo assim eu recomendo a compra de A NOVICA REBELDE (THE SOUND OF MUSIC) por todos aqueles que sao fanaticos apaixonados por este lindo musical, porque o resultado final da imagem ainda supera a do ultimo DVD. Antes de encerrar, informo que estes dois musicais vendidos pela  amazon.com  vem com legendas e dublagens em portugues do Brasil. A minha nota para TSM foi de 4 estrelas (four stars) apenas pela boa qualidade da imagem, e 5 estrelas (five stars) seria pelo filme como um todo. My TV is a Panasonic Plasma 50\\" FullHD, and my AV-Receiver is a TX-NR906 ONKYO conected to six Infinity Kappa speakers and Alfa Infinity subwoofer.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Anyone who has ever been a victim of crime and have never gotten justice from the System can readily empathize with Clyde Shelton, the star of this movie.<br /><br />The unjust \\"justice system\\" is broken and corrupt, created by the rich and corrupt for the rich and corrupt. They're not interested in justice for innocent victims of crime. What's a good man to do these days? This thrilling movie could give you a solution!<br /><br />Actor Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton whose wife and daughter were brutally murdered in a home invasion. Instead of burning the culprits, the \\"justice system\\" prefers to give them a slap on the wrist. The \\"prosecution\\" cuts a deal with one of the murderers, turning the most gulity one against his mentally challenged accomplice. An open and shut case it seems, but justice was not served. Justice was blind to the victims and all those in the System must pay. The guilty walk free while the innocent die. Just when you think that the guilty can forget their crimes, Clyde Shelton teaches all of them a lesson they can never forget.<br /><br />Watch and learn.<br /><br />Hell hath no fury like a innocent victim of crime who receives no justice from the corrupt System.<br /><br />When there's no one to live for, nothing is left to live for.<br /><br />Watch how Clyde Shelton makes full use of his skills to make the evil bastards pay!<br /><br />If only there are more Clyde Sheltons in the world today!<br /><br />Recommended watching:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000Y7U97I Death Sentence (Unrated Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I2KRZI The Punisher (Extended Cut)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0015XHP4A Rambo - The Complete Collector's Set (First Blood - Ultimate Edition / Rambo - First Blood Part II - Ultimate Edition / Rambo III - Ultimate Edition / John Rambo - Special Edition)]]
B004DCB62M|4.0|This is very confusing.   When you first open the \\"collection\\" it starts on the cover page for \\"A Study In Scarlet\\" and it appears that there is no table of contents to the other books.    You can't find the TOC by doing a menu --> go to --> \\"table of contents\\"  -- It is greyed out.  Instead do  menu --> go to -->  cover  That takes you to the real toc.    Five stars for the content -1 star for hiding the table of contents.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I was expecting a lot from this book due to the great reviews it has received.  Through the first few chapters I was a little disappointed; the author was still developing the story and not much had occurred that made it a very interesting read.  However, once the author starts into the meat of the book, his Tuesday sessions with Morrie, it becomes a definitely worthwhile book to read.    It is merely a compilation of the wonderful wisdom and insight of an old man with a unique view on life due to his fatal disease.  If you are not a very introspective person, this book may not be of much interest to you.  However, if you often find yourself examining the way you or others live your lives, this is a great book to read.
0375851569|5.0|i love reading and so does my daughter. books are always great and Dr.Seuss is a great author. always a good book.
1558216847|5.0|This was a great gift and the recipient loved it! However, he also did some research on it. While it may be a great story, it is completely false. I was very disappointed as it is advertised and sold as a true story. Guess I should have done my research like he did though BEFORE it was purchased. Oh well...entertaining for sure.
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|THIS IS A DISNEY FILM, AND IS A SATISFACTRY ONE. ENJOYABLE BY ALL.  TO THE ONE REVIEW I READ THAT INJECTED RACE INTO A REVIEW.  I WISH TO REMIND HIM THAT ALL OF DICKENS WORK REPRESENTED.  VICTORIAN ENGLAND WHEN BLACKS WERE NOT A PREDOMANIT PART  PART OF THE POPULATION..........IF ANY PART.    JIM PIOLI
B004G6009K|5.0|It's funny because I had no idea going into this movie that Alan Menken had done the music and if I had, I would have been WAY more excited about seeing the movie. As it was, I was interested because I had been part of a survey group about this movie long before they advertised it and found the premise interesting at that point. The Alan Menken Disney movies have been my Favorites of all time and that is just inching past my love for Sleeping Beauty. Back to this movie, the plot was an interesting take on an old story I had never been too thrilled over, the female character wasn't totally helpless, and I loved the comedic timing, great stuff. I'm not going to say the movie was perfect, I thought the bad guy could have used a little more umph, but I thought this was definitely a throw-back to when Disney was actually good, and when their stuff was musical and fun. And sitting in the theater I saw something I wasn't sure I would see, all the guys were laughing their rears off at this movie, and there were a lot of guys (possibly dragged) to this movie.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I am with the many reviewers that wish they had heard more of this album before spending money on it. I had heard a recording of his single \\"Hidden Away\\" and thought that the vocals were lacking, soundng strained and over-used. I like the song and thought that the rest of the cd would be of similar quality in terms of songs. But, I put that aside and purchased the cd anyways, hoping that it was just a fluke. The last album that came out wasn't my favorite until I listened to it a few times and now it's one of my favorites out of all of my cds. I hoped this would turn out the same. I was wrong all-around. Warning to anyone wanting to buy this, make sure you hear a good portion of it before purchasing. Don't waste your money like I did.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Not only is this such a classic, but it penetrates a stage that I think many cultures feel at some point in time - if expressed differently. Hundreds of years ago in Japan the samurai elite could have been classified as the ruling families and strutted power to retain control at the top. Even today the modern Yakuza continue their Japanese mafia leadership \\"if\\" away from the limelight of the status quo - but the fact is, they exist. Then the classic stereotypical mafias as depicted in these films. Today modern cases could be seen in the Middle East as families reign nations without question, or very little that makes it public. People know the consequences.<br /><br />I love the series as simply a great series, but also link it to stages societies \\"may\\" go through in various ways. I understand there are some technical issues with this box set so be cautious here in what you order (see 1 ratings below). But even the 1 ratings do not go against the overall movie - it appears as people really appreciate it.<br /><br />Be aware this is about the mafia and is far removed from Disney genres. Tarzan does not come swinging out of the trees and save people here at the last second - often scenes that appear they will end violently, end violently. So of you 1) like this genre and have not seen this series give it a go and get ready to see a classic set, or 2) if you have an interest in thinking about society and possible transitions they go through - I think the anthropologist within can also be satisfied.
B002T921AC|5.0|Love this music.  That is why I bought the CD.  I play it in my car as well as on my iPod.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This is the best remake I think I have ever seen. The acting is perfect and the story stays at its own course while still sticking to the book. I was a big fan of the book and original movie and loved the remake maybe more than the original.
1400052173|1.0|Like many who worked with the HeLa cells I was intrigued by the story of immortal cells from a cervical cancer. I would have liked more of the science and less of the melodrama of the lives of her children. The physician who developed the technique of growing these cells did not profit from it. She received good care. She had presented with advanced stage disease and was treated appropriately. The family comes off very unsympathetic in my opinion. I must admit I didn't finish the book. Save your money.
0316017922|5.0|I really appreciate Gladwell's writing style, and style to be fair, as he adds a unique flair to literature that hooks me into his reads. If you have not seen him just type his name into google and Ted Talks, and you can see what a great character he has, and his voice will lead you through his thoughts here in his books.<br /><br />Outliers is a great book from Gladwell and I guess it is not for all, but I like this. Look at the 1s and the 5s - this, to me, means he is stirring things up a bit. In literature how could this not be good. OK - some big global assumptions - but at least they are based on something and not aimed as conclusive claims but more as though experiments. I like this kind of literature.<br /><br />Read the lengthier review to determine if this is for you - or if you want a refreshing read and don't feel bad spending apx.  $10 simply add this to your cart. Can't imagine you would be disappointed and if you are great - something to discuss.
B0043CM27A|5.0|I'm not a Maroon 5 fanboi and, in fact, I never paid any attention to them in the past because I confused them with Jamiroquai.  Once I realized who they were I starting checking out their albums.  Their previous albums all had recognizable songs but didn't warrant multiple listens.    Now, on this album ('Hands All Over') I find myself continuing to sing the songs long after I've turned off the stereo, and I re-listen to it on an embarrassingly frequent rate.  It is definitely my favorite album right now.  Highly recommended!
B000031EGV|5.0|Our youngest son grew up watching this movie from the moment it came out on VHS.  Until he was about 10, he wore out several copies of this movie.<br /><br />As an adult watching it, the escapism that comes with the movie is certainly worth watching with or without the kids, again and again.<br /><br />Every child imagines a life of rolling the dice to see what awaits.  (And what a delightful parallel of life, the rolling of the dice and never knowing what's around each corner).  How imaginative this movie is and what a wonderful way for the kids, and adults too, to spend an afternoon.<br /><br />The special effects in this are nothing short of amazing and ahead of their time.  Robin Williams is a wonderful man/child drawing viewers into the story with him.<br /><br />My now nearly 17 year old son and I watched this again since he became \\"too old for Jumanji\\" and we were both captivated as though it were our first time watching it.<br /><br />This is a must-have movie for anyone with young-ish kids or grandchildren.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Only just been introduced to this series, True Blood, and could not help but come back for more.  Surprising and mesmerising all at once.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Brilliant, touching, and based on a true story. Have spent time in Japan and have seen this statue in Japan and this movie does a very good job via its \\"Hollywoodization\\" of the original Japanese version.<br /><br />If you like touching movies this is one. If you, or your kids like dogs, this is surly a hit. Get your tissues out - even us tough folk feel it.<br /><br />Superb movie!
B003L20ICE|3.0|For a movie made by a lesbian director on a lesbian theme, its surprising that the overall message here is so overwhelmingly conservative.      Absent the homosexuality (which make many of the film's gags possible), the larger message is very family values oriented, perhaps disturbingly so.  There is much significance placed on the importance of an enduring marriage and a stable home life for raising children; the undesirability and adverse consequences of extramarital affairs; and an unquestioning acceptance of the suburban, consumerist lifestyle - Ms. Bening's `Nic' is a meat-eater, with no patience for composting or recycling, and (as a good Californian) she drives the requisite Volvo wagon.      In the same way that the `Cosby Show' portrayed professional blacks as potentially just as conventional as their white counterparts; so `The Kids are All Right' shows that a lesbian couple can be just as mainstream as straights.  In fact, without the lesbian angle here, there wouldn't be a movie.    Lastly, I would also agree with the other (largely male) reviewers here who note that males (especially Mark Ruffalo as the sperm donor dad), are portrayed as shallow and unreflective - not quite the fully rounded people that women are (although no character here can be said to be particularly introspective or reflective).    The film is well written, and well crafted; the acting never falls below competency; and the production values are consistently workmanlike (or perhaps more accurately, 'workwomanlike').  And honestly, I look forward to seeing Ms. Cholodenko's next film.
030746363X|5.0|This is the best book I have read on the subject to date, though this does not surprise me, Tim shares much enthusiasm and passion for his work. I have been competing in the fitness realm for years and thought I knew everything... now I realize I am not even close. He has already packed on weight to my lifts, awesome!
0307454541|4.0|It was tough to keep the names of the family members straight but it was worth it. An excellent read, I can't wait to read the next novel by the author.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|What a brilliant movie. First of all a Roald Dahl based story so hard to go wrong there, and Clooney and Streep bring it alive. It is so childish and so adultish at the same time.<br /><br />It's good for the kids, and good for the adult as well. Great entertainment indeed! What a hit in this household.
1572815108|5.0|This is the best represented deck based on the ancient Egyptian art of Tarot reading.  My Thoth deck is magical to me and the Spirit guides I work with.  I have tried a few other decks and they do not match up to the Crowley cards.  Each card is beautifully painted to represent not only the meaning but also expresses feeling through the visual.  If you are serious about your spiritual path and the art of Tarot I highly recommend this deck! Thank you Mr. Crowley for heeding the call staying the course; and thank you Lady Frieda Harris for staying telepathicaly connected to Aleister's vision in creating the paintings for the cards visuals :)

B0036EH3UC|5.0|I never watched the old Battlestar Gallactica.  I saw a little of it and wasn't interested in the aliens, etc.  This series is definitely different.  It covers so many issues of the human condition while giving edge of the seat suspense.  Loved it and highly recommend it.
0823095223|5.0|If you're a sculptor, collector or fan of collectible statues and action figures, this book shows what goes into creating them. From concept to sculpting to molding to casting to painting, you get the process, advice and tips from giants in the field and all beautifully photographed page after page. Amazing must have book.
044656740X|1.0|If there is any good information in tis book it is over 40 pages till you get to it. So far after reading the first 40 pages the only thing I learned to make me richer is don't buy this book.  The back and forth banter between a 10 year old and his father is boring, uninformative and drawn out. If there is a point the writer should get to it.
1439177783|3.0|Although I do think this book has value to all women....even teenagers, so much of it is the same excrutiating self-loathing on every page.    I think the most value comes near the end and also the epilogue.   It's a painfully tragic and crazy-making story ..... but thankfully it ends well and with hope.  It's just so shocking that someone so lovely inside and out can feel so, so, badly and worthless about who they are.  However, it sure takes you down the path of what it's like to have a severe eating disorder and I did like her journey of getting better.
142311339X|5.0|Like previous Percy Jackson books, Lost Hero is no exception. This book mixes both Greek and Roman mythology, so you might get a bit confused at first. Though gone, Percy is not forgotten and there is promise of his return in books to come! Not to be disappointed we have a whole new set of heroes to follow. This book follows the normal conventions of Riordan's previous Percy books and it will have your palms sweating and keep you turning pages till the very end. Can't wait for part 2!

B0049YU4HC|5.0|I bought this watch from Amazon.com sold by Savvy watches. I received the watch fairly quickly and Savvy included some kind of pouch for the watch and also a Tissot paper bag which you usually get if you purchased the watch in-store.   The watch looks great and is light. The yellow hands on the black dial look nice. The only thing I was slightly surprised by was the width of the strap. From the pictures I thought it was wider. No big deal though.    It would also be great if amazon has a picture of the watch placed against a scale so that we can see how big/small the watch is because pictures don't always give you a perfect idea.     p.s: I bought this as a gift for my cousin. I would never buy a $300+ watch for myself :P
B00192IV9U|5.0|After reading some less than positive reviews I felt I should state a few things. First of all I think those who put the Michael album together had Michael Jackson's best interest at heart and tried to keep it true to his artistic nature. I have been a MJ fan since I was 4 years old, and I found that this is an excellent album with an array of his different musical styles. Everyone has a right to their opinion, however I feel those who rated this album poorly are being overly critical. Rumor has it that the Michael album is the first of 7 albums that sony will be putting out becuase MJ had over a 100 songs he never released if this is true I can't wait. My overall opinion is that I love the Michael album and highly recommend it.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|I am either not young enough or not cool enough to appreciate Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but if this movie is the epitome of being young and cool, I think I'll pass.  Based on a graphic novel, the film version tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a twentysomething part time bass player who falls for the new girl in town.  Her name is Ramona Flowers and Scott is instantly smitten with her.  The catch is that in order to be with her, he must defeat her seven deadly exes, each of whom is presented as a super villian with some sort of superpowers that Scott must defeat in video game/comic book fashion.  Why?  I suppose the point that the movie is trying to make is that the baggage and loose ends from our past relationships will catch up with us and hurt our future relationships if we choose to ignore and run from them.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter what the point is, however, becasue everything in this movie-the characthers, the plot, the themes (or lack thereof)-is secondary to the film's hyperactive visual style.  The movie plays like a giant mash up of video games and comic books not only in it's pacing but in its visual style as well.  The film can't seem to stay focused on any one scene or idea for more than a few seconds before it has to jump to something else that will keep our eyes glued to the screen. This might not be a problem if the movie wasn't so self aware about how cool and funny it thinks it is or if even one of the characters wasn't a completely annoying, self absorbed emotional infant.  Maybe that's the point of the movie--that these are young adults who have yet to reach emotional maturity.  But I doubt it.  In the end, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is all about how flashy and cool a movie it is.  For some, that will be enough.  For me, it's game over.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Best part of this package is the live concert from 1978 Darkness Tour.  It is absolutely incredible. The song selection is absolutely perfect and brings back to being 16 and the amazing nights on the Darkness tour. Worth the price of purchsase just for this.
030746363X|5.0|Nearly anyone could benefit from this book. The array of experiments is impressive. At the very least it should lead you to massive self improvements in multiple areas of your life.
B003I64748|5.0|FANTASTIC!!! It disappoints me that the album has received so many poor reviews. I question if people have even listened to it. It is a remarkable album, one of 2010's best. Way to go Christina!!!
B000JBWWBK|5.0|The songs bring the images of Provence, and the scenes of the film. Besides, they have a nostalgic tone...just like one of the movie scenes: a little table, a cigar, a chair in a garden, a sunny day, spring, flowers, birds, old songs....and forget about everything else.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|If this is the only 3d movie you have to watch on your new 3d tv, you will be very disappointed . Nothing jumped out of the screen and I thought something was wrong with my set up.. I would not recommend this movie in 3d. I can't believe the movie studios are dragging their feet on releasing better 3d movies in time for the busiest retail season of the year .. Why are they taking so long to put out 3d blu ray movies. This is going to hurt the sale of the 3d tv's for the Christmas season if there is only a limited selection of movies to watch..
B00003L2I0|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Gilbert O'Sullivan's most memorable songs, including great hit songs like, Clair, Alone Again, Nothing Rhymed, plus recent masterpieces like, At the Very Mention of Your Name, Lost a Friend, I Wish I Could Cry, Dear Dream, and I'll Believe It When I See It, all of which share the wistful lyricism and the heart-felt poetry.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My 9-yr old was able to put this together over a couple of days.  He is THRILLED with all of the characters and all of the play in the Death Star.  More than average play time; he is having a blast.
B00192IV9U|5.0|With all the hoopla and noise relative to this album...Michael...it's one worth listening to..I'd recommend everyone to purchase this CD, you won't regret it. Posthumously MJ, he'd be pleased with the outcome....I especially love, The(I Like)Way You Love Me... wonderfully orchestrated and reminiscent of the bygone days, yet relevant to today's romantic; the lyrics are clean, clear, concise and relative for any age group. Hold My Hand..the opening track by Akon and MJ is so wonderfully energetic and enligtening.<br /><br />Kudos to all the visionaries who had a hand in the production of Michael..you did good...this album is pure genius!  Forever \\"Michael\\" the omnipresent, is always with us!
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|This is a very neat little product, The sound is decent, however, not clean. If you are looking for a clean, undistorted sound, this is not right for you. If you like distortion, this headphone amp is nearly perfect. It may say Metal, but, it does so much more. You can get anything from just a little crunchiness to a Metal (not too heavy, gets too distorted) sound. I paired this amp with a pair of Sony MDR7506 Pro's and it allows me to play all night a move around without waking up anyone in the house, or the neighborhood. It is also nice that I am no longer confined to on area in the house to play. I can move around freely and not put myself into complete seclusion when I wanna break out my guitar. I would recommend this product to anyone whose ever had to put up with roommates or household members complaining about your guitar playing.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Just get the album. You won't be disappointed. I got it and after listening to it once I had to wipe sweat off my brow. I subsequently listened to it for a week straight. Heafy takes his vocals to a new level, I mean he hits the highs, he hits the lows, he really developed a fantastic vocal range.     I can go on, but I highly recommend you listen for yourself. Can't wait for their next album. Shogun is heads above their other albums.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The only reason I cannot give these a 5star rating is because the cord/plug just gets in the way sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I love the sound, comfort, durability, and everything about these headphones except the cord/plug. I mainly use these while listening to music on my laptop and while playing my guitar, using my miniamp. While on my laptop the plug, or jack, whatever you want to call it, sticks out a little far and I am always worried about breaking it. Wile using my miniamp with my guitar the cord stretches to far down under its own weight and I am worried about tripping over it and possible damaging the plug/jack. Other that these two minor problems, I love these headphones. The sound is amazing, sounds great no matter what I'm listening to and no matter what volume. I have stepped on, sat on, dropped, and abused these and they work flawlessly. Definitely a great investment.
030746363X|1.0|I read an article in WIRED about this book and thought it would be interesting, perhaps having some decent information.     However, I am a competitive runner, and everything in the chapters based upon aerobic and running training is horribly wrong.  Everything he says goes against the general thought in distance training, training ideals that have dozens of effective studies supporting them, without providing any of his own, all while claiming \\"go with the facts, not the masses\\", which I found a touch ironic. I can't say anything on the rest because I am only well-learned in endurance training, but since I do know everything he wrote on that subject is more or less crap, I would be weary when doing anything else he recommends.  It could be that only his theories on distance training are ineffective and everything else is a gem of information, but I am doubtful.
B002MBSZ98|5.0|This box set is priceless, outstanding and amazing. Sound quality and music arrangements reaching the perfection. This material clearly demonstrate the vision and talent of one of the greatest leaders bands ever: Robert Fripp.  It is delightful to listen this band at their best. This product is not for everyone, but just for those who really appreciate and know about rock on any of it genres: progressive, hard, art, symphonic, psychedelic, etc. The fusion amongst classical music, jazz, blues and rock is simply out of this world. It is very impressive to listen the type of variation on the Court Of The Crimson King album, passing from the heavy gem of 21st Century Schizoid Man to easy jewel arrangements such as Epitaph, I Talk To The Wind, Moonchild and The Court Of The Crimson King.<br /><br />King Crimson best ever alignement: Robert Fripp (guitar), Greg Lake (bass guitar), Ian McDonald (woodwind, keyboards & mellotron) and Michael Giles (drums & percussions), supported by Peter Sinfield (words & illumination) leaves clear that best rock was made within 70's decade. From my personal point of view, there is no other group even as King Crimson. Some other really greatest bands such as Rush, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Le Orme, New Trolls, Camel, Pendragon, Colosseum, Premiata Forneria & Marconi, Banco, Maschera di Cera, Grobschnitt, Yes, EL&P, Latte e Mielle, Magma, Can, Kayak, Caravan, Procol Harum, Riverside, Van Der Graaf Generator, Porcupine Tree, Renaissance are still short compared with King Crimson.<br /><br />This box set is a treasure and because of that is just for really fans and progressive rock experts, so don't lose your time if you are fan of bands such as Marillion, Dream Theater, No Man, Madonna, Lady Ja Ja, Michael Jackson, Blackfield, Asia, etc.<br /><br />It is important to clarify that this is not rock for the masses, but is ART ROCK in all the extension of this term.<br /><br />Expensive? No if you understand rock.<br /><br />God bless King Crimson since their genesis to the end of times!d of times!

0307271862|2.0|The story falls flat from its hype.  The character development is weak, and the \\"international espionage\\" aspect is weaker. I could not believe the characters, and the author fails to build tension with the plot.  I had bought the book with high hopes, and was very disappointed.
1416562605|5.0|I read this book while I was in India for 2 weeks. At first I didn't understand why the font looked smeared in some pages, until I realized the book was actually pirated, which confirmed one of the main tenets described in The White Tiger: How corrosive corruption can be.<br /><br />One of the most humorous, realistic and humane books I've ever read. If you read A Fine Balance by Mistry, which is in itself a master piece, you'll find a perfect complement on this novel. Mistry's dark reading can make you cry. Adiga will get your eyes -and your pants- wet.<br /><br />A very ad-hoc novel that shades some light on the life and problems of India, on the challenges of democracy in poor countries... and on human nature.<br /><br />P.S. Of course I bought the book after reading the pirated copy, which my daughter forbade me from destroying because in her words: You never destroy a book.

B003L20ICE|4.0|This review is from: The Kids Are All Right (DVD)<br />\\"The Kids are All Right,\\" directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko, is the story of Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), the mothers of two children, a son named Laser, and a daughter, Joni. Now that Joni has turned eighteen, she is preparing to go away to college. Before she leaves, Laser urges her to learn the identity of their biological father, a sperm donor chosen by Nic and Jules. Joni gets the information with relative ease, and soon, she and her brother meet Paul (Mark Ruffalo).<br /><br />Cholodenko, who is gay and has a child with her partner, understands the dynamics of this unconventional household. Nic and Jules, like any married couple, have begun to bicker over small things. Nic, a physician, is brittle and controlling. Jules, who is softer and more subservient, wishes that she had developed herself professionally; she is tired of being looked upon as little more than a housewife. However, the two women are united in their concern for Joni and Laser, whom they treat with firmness tempered by unconditional love.<br /><br />Paul is the catalyst for a crisis that could undo Nic and Jules. Not only does this motorcycle riding, ingratiating, and laid-back restaurateur capture the kids' hearts, but he comes between Nic and Jules. If the \\"moms\\" send him packing, Laser and Joni will be angry and resentful, but should Nic and Jules allow Paul to barge in and destroy what has taken them years to build?<br /><br />All of the actors are terrific. Bening, as the edgy and bossy Nic, tries to hide her vulnerability, and Ruffalo almost steals the film with his charisma and easygoing charm. Moore is confused as a woman who is having a midlife crisis and is going a bit crazy. The profanity and explicit sexuality are off-putting at times, and the generally strong script has Jules behaving in a way that is not entirely believable. Still, there is warmth, wit, humor, and depth in this film that effectively conveys a universal truth: The bonds in any nuclear family may be strong, but they are not unbreakable.

B003UESJH4|4.0|When Prince Albert is called upon to give a speech at the British Empire Exhibition in 1925, his stammer is excruciating.  His wife, Elizabeth, fed up with the long list of \\"qualified\\" professionals who cannot help her husband, hires Lionel Logue to treat Albert.  Logue is an Australian &eacute;migr&eacute; whose methods are, to say the least, unconventional.  Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush with his usual energy and panache, empathizes with his client.  However, he lets \\"Bertie\\" know that he must do as he is told if he wants to improve.  He urges Albert to curse, sing, perform repetitive and weird exercises, and speak freely about his painful childhood. Unsurprisingly, Albert and Logue do not see eye to eye.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech,\\" directed by Tom Hooper from David Seidler's witty and poignant script, depicts Albert's valiant attempt to overcome his crippling handicap.  Colin Firth is exceptional as Albert, a man who never expected to be king.  His older brother, Edward, ascends the throne upon the death of their cold and commanding father, but abdicates to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.  Thus, Albert is thrust into the role of monarch, and, as George VI, he is required to address his subjects using a relatively new technology--radio.  When England declares war against Germany, George delivers an address (with Logue's assistance), in an effort to rally and unite the nation.<br /><br />Firth and Rush play off one another brilliantly and Carter is lovely and warm as Albert's ever-supportive wife.  However, the movie sags a bit in the second half, as Albert and Logue repeatedly quarrel and reconcile.  Since it is obvious where the story is headed, the main pleasure lies in watching two virtuoso performers, Firth and Rush, struggle to understand and appreciate one another's point of view.  It is inspiring to see the tenacious and creative Logue help George find his voice after suffering through years of self-loathing and insecurity.  What begins as a prickly and precarious relationship between two men with nothing in common evolves into an enduring and mutually beneficial friendship.ionship between two men with nothing in common evolves into an enduring and mutually beneficial friendship.
B0042816YK|3.0|It is a saturday night, its raining outside, and I didnt feel like Inception or Despicable Me. I was hoping for a foreign film, but the choices I looked at under \\"video on demand\\" at amazon didnt offer any of my choices, so I chose Eat Pray Love.<br /><br />I am glad I didnt read the book, because there is nothing worse than having to read about a woman who apparently has everything drone on and on and on and on and on about having looks, career, a handsome husband, and just be so unhappy.  She didnt drone on verbally, but it was the constant state of unhappiness the character was in that was droning. It sucked my energy.<br /><br />Having done my own spritual quest these past 7 years, it was topped off last June by me breaking my leg, dislocating my knee cap, and tearing ligaments, my meniscus and finally placing cracks between where the joints meet. I've done my share of spiritual quest and I approached this as teaching me something - what i learned I wont share.  Having had to use crutches since June of 2010 (its now december), I've learned to be more in tune with the disabled. I rarely see them in grocery stores, the mall, anywhere. And its taught me that we're so caught up in our own world, that the only time we care about those who live a slower life that is parallel to our superficial lives, is aroudn Christmas.<br /><br />So having to sit through a movie where this woman has looks, a career, money, a handsome husband, numerous friends, is able to walk, eat, cook, essentially take care of herself, travel, and pretty much has more going for her except that she's a dreary soul is hard to sit through.<br /><br />I fast forwarded through alot of it. I'm a Pisces and a big fan of Javier Bardem and he shined like a jewel; thus the 3rd star.<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend eat pray love because it is a homage to egotistical maniacs who bemoan there existence and are not grateful for anything. Is that a spritual journey? Really?
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|After reading many reviews on the Nicki Minaj album, I was very hesitant on buying it.. and I'm glad that I did! I was pleasantly surprised by how good that album is. Nicki has been featured is so many songs lately, and everyone has been waiting for her to release her own album. I will admit, that sometimes I thought her voice sounded a little \\"different\\" and I was wondering if I'd be able to handle listening to an entire album of just her, but really it was great. She not only raps in her songs but there's a couple tracks were she actually sings and she has quite a good singing voice too. I think it's great that she went outside of the box and got a pop artist like Natasha Bedingfield to do a track with her too. It turned out to be one of my favorite songs on the album. I would recommend this album to anyone who can enjoy rap & pop music. This album was nothing like I though it would be and I feel this album deserves a second listen by the people who thought it was bad.
B003NQB552|5.0|Recently read an article in the British magazine Classic Rock about this band and decided to check them out.

If you like good guitar driven rock you can't miss with this album.
044661758X|5.0|I write this review during the week that the Los Angeles Police Department released a 180 photo trove of the possible victims from the South Los Angeles serial killer infamously known as \\"The Grim Sleeper.\\" As more lurid details emerge and unfold from the world of this real life monster (real name: Lonnie David Franklin Jr) I finish and reflect on Connelly's Concrete Blonde and the realism of his book. Connelly's character/serial killer The Dollmaker, in this case, could have only been created and imagined from the mind of a true insider and award-winning journalist. Connelly certainly deserves the same accolades that Thomas Harris once did with Red Dragon[[ASIN:0425228223 Red Dragon]] and The Silence of the Lambs[[ASIN:0749324082 Silence of the Lambs]]-- I love that Connelly was inspired to begin writing after he had seen Altman's film The Long Goodbye...[[ASIN:B000069HZU The Long Goodbye]] a 70's film based on the Raymond Chandler classic (also highly recommend if you have not seen it).<br /><br />Recently crime novelist Denise Hamilton[[ASIN:1936070022 Los Angeles Noir 2: The Classics (Akashic Noir)]] listed Concrete Blonde as part of \\"20 Noir Essentials\\" and I couldn't agree more. Considered LA Noir, The Concrete Blonde captures the classic seediness of Los Angeles and the FBI profiling that has also paved the way, been portrayed and ever popularized by television series like Criminal Minds[[ASIN:B003TFAJ18 Criminal Minds: Fifth Season]] and CSI.<br /><br />It is staggering to know, that according to an FBI Behavioral Unit study, 85% of the world's serial killers are in America. At any given time 20 - 50 unidentified active serial killers are at work continually changing their targets and methods.<br /><br />We will never understand the dark and sadistic mind's of real serial killers and the heinous crimes that take place in our society and what we read in the papers or internet or hear on the news about predators like the Grim Sleeper; it's just inscrutable.  But at the end of the day we can put Connelly's Concrete Blonde back on the shelf and say \\"that was a great book\\" and Detective Harry Bosch wins. We need more detectives like Harry Bosch and more gifted writers like Michael Connelly.ut at the end of the day we can put Connelly's Concrete Blonde back on the shelf and say \\"that was a great book\\" and Detective Harry Bosch wins.

When I heard that he had an album out, I was so excited. However, it is not sold in the U.S. I went searching everywhere for samples of the songs and where I could buy a copy. I love almost every song on the album. He really shows off the smokeyness of his voice and the pop part of it. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and if you are a super A.J. fan like me, this is a must buy!!! =)

B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is the show that rocks the cradle of televisions Twilight into the mysterious.  Most of my own experiences with theoretical science is as much along the fringe as was most people, I knew, who knew of Einstein Theory of Relativity.  Most people haven't had a page of information from any of Great Thinkers on the level since most text from geniuses is complex and only bookish science minded students of the arts and sciences read the entire text of people like Plato.  Works of Jules Verne are even edited for the same reasons.  Some people still don't even know about some scientific reasoning unless it was from a movie.  The first movie I actually saw in the local theater I would call a Sci-Fi movie was, \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"  I was dropped off, by myself.  My parent's, sister's and brother's did not see it.  After I did see it all my talk about it got that, \\"We don't know what you're talking about.\\" look.  I still wanted a pal like Robby the Robot.  FRINGE, the television show, is a show of a quality which barters with scientific studies.  The kind of studies I have had a little bit more of since I began studying Ancient Philosopher's.  Most people I talked to don't realize that Atlantis was written about, FOR REAL, centuries ago.  I found a collection of books at the library which has over 60 books that carry on the fascinating words of thought which extends from as far back as Aristotles' teachers time and up to modern times.  (I understand why more people don't watch, FRINGE.  FRINGE could go on for 30 centuries using the addition of thoughts from all the great philosopher's.  Their works could be converted into fascinating probabilities which is what FRINGE is all about.

B002ZG980U|5.0|There have been several movies done about shared dreaming, however this movie pulls it off perfectly. Far better than Dreamscape which was one of the better ones. This movie focuses on the plot of *using* the tech instead of making it which allows it to bring in all the pieces of a movie that make them great.     Don't be put off at the end. It is exactly what you think it should be. For more info ther, just google the web for why you can know that.

'Drity Diana' is the one that makes anybody feel naughty and is a TRUE rock song. 'Just good Friends' is a fun song and with Stevie Wonder, who can't go wrong. 'Speed Demon' is a machine song that has the need for speed feel and would porbably be the one use at drag racing. 'I just Can't Stop Loving You' is beautiful and is very romantic. 'Leave Me Alone' is loosely autobio and you can tell by how Michael sings the title. 'Man in the Mirror' is a song of charity and is wonderful to sing to. 'Smooth Criminal' is a real story song about crime and is tough all the way. 'Liberian Girl' is like a nature song and is a perfect compilment to a girlfriend. 'Another Part of Me' is fun and was use for the mini movie 'Captain EO'.<br /><br />Overall, this album is great and IS the album I wish surpassed 'Thriller' so much.

B003UESJHO|3.0|As is the case with many inspirational sports movies, \\"The Fighter\\" uses physical competition as a metaphor for emotional competition. It's based on the true story of Lowell, Massachusetts boxer \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward, who went pro in 1985, went on hiatus after losing four consecutive fights in 1990, and then made a comeback that lasted from 1997 until his retirement in 2003. His final match was a trilogy of fights with Arturo Gatti, but all events in the film lead up to an earlier match with Shea Neary. This change might have stemmed from a desire to make the film even more symbolic, Neary being from Liverpool and Ward fighting against the odds on foreign soil. I dare not make that claim with any degree of certainty. Watch the film and decide for yourself. I'm sure it can be interpreted in a number of ways.    In the film, Micky (Mark Wahlberg) lives in the shadow of his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), himself a boxer who fought Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978 and came home a legend. Now aging and in the throes of a crack addiction, we find a camera crew from HBO following him around, the director shooting a documentary about his drug abuse. He has nothing but his memories of that long ago fight, which may be why he feels he must personally train Micky as he struggles to make a comeback. But it's not merely a matter of personally training him; he never lets Micky make his own decisions about how a fight is supposed to be fought. When it comes to being in the ring, Dicky knows best, and that's all there is to it. Micky cannot get a word in edgewise.    It's even worse with his chain smoking mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), probably one of the least likable people I've seen a movie all year. She has appointed herself as Micky's manager and never lets him have a say in anything. For reasons never adequately explained, she deeply distrusts anyone who can train Micky professionally; reputable managers are out to steal him blind, and anyone who suggests otherwise isa traitor to the family. Behind her all the way are her daughters, seven of the most unpleasant, unlovable women ever to pollute the silver screen. Watching them with their mother is a little like watching a cult figure brainwashing her disciples. There's no better proof of this then a scene in which Alice and her girls simultaneously storm over to retrieve Micky from his girlfriend's house.    Her name is Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). She went to college on a scholarship but blew it by partying too hard and skipping too many classes. Now she's stuck Lowell tending a seedy bar. She and Micky immediately hit it off, but the same cannot be said about her and Micky's family. Alice and her daughters are convinced, through nothing other than rumor, that she's a wild MTV party girl. Charlene, tough and foul-mouthed, has no problem telling off Alice and Dicky, and it goes on like this until a very unlikely turnaround near the end of the film, when miraculously everyone is in Micky's corner. In her own way, Charlene is just as controlling as Micky's mother; both claim to have his best interests at heart, and both say whatever they can to prevent Micky from consorting with the other.    Have you noticed that I've said a lot about everyone around Micky but not so much about Micky? The film is essentially about a man who has been pushed around and lacks the ability to speak for himself. In this sense, the film is effective; we long for that moment when Micky will finally take a stand for his independence and make his family realize that his voice is just as important as theirs. Basically, he wants to get along with his family and his girlfriend. Why should he have to choose? When Dicky is arrested and sentenced to eight months in jail, Micky hires a new manager, who makes him promise to never again train with Dicky. At first, Micky agrees, for the arrest resulted in his right hand getting broken. But upon Dicky's release, Micky releases that being trained by his brother is important to him. Again, why must he choose? Can't we all just get along?    Despite receiving top billing, this really isn't a vehicle for Mark Wahlberg. The spotlight is on Christian Bale, whose intense, oddly rhythmic take on Dicky is convincing. We have by now become accustomed to Bale suffering for his art, and \\"The Fighter\\" is no exception; to play an authentic crack head, he had to his lose a noticeable amount of weight. We have also heard plenty about his practice of staying in character during movie shoots; true to form, he retained Dicky's powerful Boston accent all throughout filming. His performance is praiseworthy, and yet it's also in service of a contrived story that hits all the predictable notes. \\"The Fighter\\" certainly has its good points, but I have an unshakable feeling that its claim of being based on a true story is a bit of an understatement.
B000N7KTBU|5.0|This is the second Transcend enclosure I purchased (the first one was RED). When I purchase a new computer, I typically put in larger hard drives. Why pay $100 or more to the computer company for a larger hard drive when you can install your own cheaper and have a spare drive for use as a portable drive?<br /><br />If you are prone to doing so, these drive enclosures allow you to reutilize the removed drive. Don't sell your removed drive on eBay for a few bucks; rather - buy a drive enclosure and you will have a nice portable backup drive for photos, etc. for just the few dollars the enclosure costs.<br /><br />If you purchase an already assembled portable drive, such as a WD Passport, you have to contend with a virtual drive; if you buy an IOmega drive, you may get a OEM drive with a 1yr warranty (in contrast most raw drives you buy carry 3yr or 5yr warranties).<br /><br />I am always having problems with the WD Passport virtual drive; either the driver is missing when I upgrade OS, or not recognized by Linux, and even if I disable it, there have been some permission issues. I don't need that kind of complexity in my life, all I want is a simple disk drive for storage of photos, and I don't need any virtual drive messing with me.<br /><br />And since I use Linux for my NAS, WD's virtual drive AND IOmega's drives don't play well with the NAS'es OS.  This stuff is in the firmware of the drive enclosure I believe, and all but impossible to get rid of. I might be wrong, but there seem to be \\"issues\\" with those drives on anything but Windows and perhaps Mac OSes.<br /><br />A simple drive enclosure as the Transcend; coupled with a standard 2.5\\" internal HDD works perfectly, and is perhaps cheaper; especially if you re-use a drive you removed from your computer after upgrading it.

B002MW50KO|5.0|As everyone notes, Dylan's voice has turned into an almost demonic croak.  But it doesn't matter!  Most Christmas albums by contemporary singers just try for pretty-pretty glosses of traditional songs they don't really care about.  There's usually no depth to them and precious little real joy.    But this is Dylan.  Dylan clearly cares about the music. It's his homage to a certain kind of retro American Christmas song style (from around the 40s and 50s).  In the process he brings more life and joy to these songs than ever existed in the classics from that era.  It's almost like he's singing for his grandkids here + wanting them to have a really good time. His voice, raspy frog that it is, expresses joy, and even devotion (!), that puts all the superficial pretty-pretty Christmas albums to shame. Buy it!  I dare you not to feel happy while listening to it (even while you giggle at Dylan's voice).

You Got The Silver is a Keith gem, and it is a great song.  Country Honk is a different version of Honky Tonk Woman and it is a great blues song.  Love in Vain is a cover of a great blues song, and Mick is really wailing on this track.  I'm not going to review each song, but you will love this album.  Also, some great rock piano by Al Cooper and another, but you will have to read the liner notes or research to find out whom.    This should be played loudly.  On vinyl, it is great as vinyl is superior to compact disc except in portibility.  Sonically it is without peer, and the artist intended you to hear it this way.  They KNOW!!  In summary, this is one of the top 100 albums of all time for a reason and that is the masterful writing and playing of the Glimmer Twins.  Now, if you will excuse me I am looking for eleven on the amp.  Cheers!

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is one of the cutest I have seen in a long time. It is age appropriate for the younger kids if you don't mind them seeing a fart gun (Really what kid in public school does not hear things worse than this)and a toy character that is animated photocopy there butt (Again Kids do, see, and say worse things tan this when they are with other kids.) yet still entertaining for the grownups. This is a definite must watch children s movie.

B001DXS4E2|5.0|This is SUCH as amazing deal!<br />Of course the movie itself is amazing. With Bing Crosby's voice and Fred Astaire's dancing, you can never go wrong. For only $15, you not only get the original Black and White version but the new color version (which is amazing! It looks like it was originally filmed in color - wonderful) AND the soundtrack to the movie!! I love EVERY song and it is WELL worth the SMALL price!<br />If you love classic movies and wonderful Christmas/holiday films, you will want to add this one to your collection!<br />If you don't have it you should! Haha.<br />I hope this helped!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I will keep this simple since this is a pretty well reviewed movie. I got the combo pack and lent a friend the DVD while I kept the Blu-Ray. This movie is long at 148 minutes but it is good and the extra time is needed for the layers of the movie. It has good pacing and good acting. There is a good mix of action and intrigue. It keeps you guessing is a movie that you have to focus to watch. I have not even scrapped the extra included because I know I will probbly spend another few hours alone on them. All in all I recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to sit down and have their intellect challenged.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|I recently watched \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" on DVD, and it was absolutely awesome. A friend recomnmended ROME to me to follow up on my latest guilty pleasure. Well, there is no comparison. Spartacus is an action filled guys' wet dream. Rome, in comparison, is more for the casual audience. Rome is something you can watch with your wife and she will like the drama and the character development, while the guys will like the occasional quick nudity and violence. ROME is by no means a bad purchase. The production values are high, the story is good, the characters likable and I am enjoying it in a measured approach. There is the old backstabbing family feud, the friendship between soldiers, some of the actual history, like Ceasar and Brutus, and whatever you would expect to find in Rome. If you want the gratuitous, highly stylized version of Rome's gladiators in a fight to the death, get Spartacus: Blood and Sand instead. Be advised, your wife will not like that one...
B002ISID10|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the \\"screamo\\" genre, but this album is unique, the screaming is phenomenal with what I believe is 2 or even 3 of the members working together to produce a large range of highs to lows. The melodic singing is great, only a couple parts does it really go a little too sissy for me. The breakdowns are simple but heavy and extremely satisfying, and sprinkling a little bit of techno into it is freaking awesome. The song titles are funny, but the lyrics are more serious and well written. They're not going to blow your mind with metaphors and deep thought, but their messages are real and they sing/scream the words with passion. I'm definitely keeping an eye out for them on tour and I'm going to see them as soon as they are anywhere close. I recommend this for people who like The Devil Wears Prada, In Fear and Faith, A Day To Remember, etc. And I would like to say that this band blows those bands out of the water.
B002GZQY6Q|1.0|Why does this album get such critical acclaim and overly favourable reviews? Are you serious? \\"The incident\\" is full of nothing but stock guitars that are far from original or unique. The comparisons to the greatness and scope of Pink Floyd are mildly exaggerated. Porcupine Tree on The Incident  absolutely void of emotion. The sound on every song is flat and boring. If you want powerful emotion effectively conveyed try the Smashing Pumpkins-Gish,Peter Gabriel-Live,David Gilmour-Live in Gadansk Poland,or The Prayer Chain-Mercury albums.I cant believe Porcupine Tree gets such rave reviews. They are kinda like Tool without the talent.The lyrics are the most uninspiring I have every heard coming from a band with such critical acclaim. What a depressing album. Its a real disappointment for me to see the band joining Roadrunner  Records which promote so many dark, metal bands. Have the reviewers of The Incident not been privy to all the music that has come before,because I feel like Porcupine Tree has really borrowed the stylings of so many that have gone before making the record a chore to get through.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I recently purchased and having been enjoying thoroughly, the soundtracks to Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.      As a professional musician and closet composer, I have to say I rate Nicholas Hooper's score a 5 out of 5.  His music is original and yet well versed in the language of Post-Romanticism, in which movies are the most active medium for this style of classical music to dwell.  That is not to say that his style is completely Post-Romantic, just that there are Post-Romantic elements utilized in his music and much of the movie scores we enjoy in movies today.    The score is evocative, the harmony changes smooth and unpedestrian and the themes beautifully capture each moment in the movie and the personalities of each character/s depicted.  Additionally I enjoyed how the music was presented on the cd - as a continuous tone poem with very little or no space between the selections.    Some of my favorite themes are:    The Room of Requirement - 5th Movie  The Ministry of Magic - 5th Movie   Dumbledore's Farewell - 6th Movie   When Ginny Kissed Harry - 6th Movie    The Room of Requirement's opening chords are an homage to those who enjoy Ligeti.  Yet, they are so original I would only say that they utilize Ligeti's structure.  The sonic effect is Mr. Hooper's own.    The Ministry of Magic theme captures beautifully the hustle, bustle and inspirational atmosphere one would feel upon entering those magical halls.  Yes, I am not a fan of minimalism, but I enjoy Mr. Hooper's use and then abandon of that structure to achieve the desired effect.    When Ginny Kissed Harry is so beautifully simple and yet made so poignant with the introduction of the Room of Requirement chord from the 5th soundtrack.  It captures that gentle moment perfectly and never lets us forget about the magic that is constantly around the two characters and flowing through them.    Regarding the passacaglia that Mr. Hooper composed for Dumbledore's Farewell - the music is hauntingly simple and yet so beautifully complex.  He brilliantly executes Purcell's ability to have a repeating basso continuo and add one painfully beautiful harmonic layer upon another so that you are weeping at the end and longing for more.  The only downfall of the piece is that he had to end that it after a few minutes. As a movie composer, one is married to the director's storyboard - that is in no means a criticism of David Yates, 5 and 6 (and now 7.1 and 7.2's director), merely an observation of the structure of movie composition in general.    Segueing more into the structure of movie music composition and process - I was also immediately impressed how the director, David Yates, included Mr. Hooper in the very early stages of the movie's story boarding and filming process and was even able to play musical themes for the actors while they were rehearsing scenes.  As a performer of opera and an actress that also sings, this is the ultimate experience - to have the music influence your interpretation of your character!  I had never before heard of such a process and perhaps this is why I found the music and the story telling so seamlessly entwined with one another, unlike the other Harry Potter movies.  I will add, that I felt this way before I knew the fact regarding Mr. Hooper's composing process with Mr. Yates.    In summary, Mr. Hooper utilizes the best in classical music styles with his own original voice to put forward a beautifully executed and seamless score to the 5th and 6th films.  I was disappointed that he could not do the two films devoted to the 7th book. I hope that I will get to hear Mr. Hooper's compositions in the future and also in mediums outside of movie making where he would be allowed a bit more flexibility as in symphonic and operatic works.    Cheers and Best Regards - Tami Swartz
B002MW50KO|1.0|I thought this was a satire, even after hearing some of the songs. I thought someone was playing a goofy joke on all of us. Imagine the bard of the sixties, the voice of a generation, singing seasonal elevator music. These aren't even new arrangements. It sounds like they just dubbed Bob mumbling the words over the standard AM radio versions. Dylan has done a lot of mediocre music since his heyday, but this is so bad that even Christmas seems cheapened. Buy this CD for someone you don't like.
B00192IV9U|3.0|..but, sadly this is not the case. \\"Keep Your Head Up\\", \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"Monster\\" contain no Michael vocals whatsoever.    It's a real sad situation for MJ's legacy, seeing it being manipulated like this by the Cascios and $ONY. A real fan can tell the difference. Just listen to the other 7 tracks on the album, or the rest of Michael's discography.    Once again, $ONY releases a product with Michael's name on it just to cash in, without considering the millions of fans around the world.    You disgust me.

B003NFM3JU|1.0|I was really excited to buy this movie on DVD and watch it with my family this year.  My husband and I have a 2 year old toddler and thought that watching the Christmas Carol movie with him would be such a treat each holiday season. Plus, it is made by Disney, so I thought for sure it will be kid friendly and well made...  Well, my husband and I were both deeply disappointed in this version.  I think it is one of the worst ones out there... I love the actors and couldn't believe how bad this movie was.  It was a horror flick for my little one, - Scrooge looks super creepy and the ghost of Marley is un-necessarily horifying with his mouth snapping out of joint and all... This is NOT a movie to watch with little children!  Actually, my husband didn't want to watch it much past the ghost of Christmas Past.  Many of the important parts of the story were completely left out... for example, the scene where Scrooge's father mistreats him during his youth is not in this movie at all. I also have to say that the ghost of Christmas Past is just a freaky made-up character that looks like a jittery candle with a face... not at all creative in my opinion!  Well, enough said, I returned this one!
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|I, as a 37 Y/O male, am embarassed that this is the first Chaplin film I've ever seen. Simply put: MESMERIZING. I could not take my eyes off this character for a second. From start to finish CHAPLIN delivers in grandy-oso style. Its unlike anything I've ever seen before. The Blu-ray is a remarkable transfer considering this film is close to 75 years old and a very worthy addition to any collection. At the end I was left to ponder this: How can a man transform film and acting while never uttering a word? Can Jim Carrey, Steve Carrel, Will Ferrel or any comedian (Maybe Rowan Atkinson) for that matter have delivered such laughs while saying nothing. I think not. This masterpiece left me wanting more...does he really do that roller state scene with the missing railing? How did they film the scene with the tools flying everywhere? Remarkable at every turn. I immediately went on to look for other Chaplin stuff and came across City Lights....$80 second hand becasue its out of print. Please hurry and getCity Lights to Blu-Ray.
0312383320|2.0|Plum Spooky didn't work for me on a couple of levels. The Between-the-Numbers books have always revolved around holidays. Given the title, Plum Spooky, I was expecting a Halloween themed Stephanie Plum/Diesel book. This book had no Halloween focus and was in no way spooky in theme.<br /><br />The tie in between the spookiness of the title and the actual plot was that the book had a lot of action in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey - home of the Jersey Devil. Even as a life long resident of NJ, I have no interest in the Pine Barrens or its legends. The Jersey Devil isn't something terrifying to me. The book places it on the same level as the Loch Ness Monster and Sasquatch. The problem is that some people actually believe in Nessie and Sasquatch. People have tried to prove their existence. The Jersey Devil is nothing but tourist baiting, hoping to get the gullible in the the Pine Barrens and paying for the tours.<br /><br />And, then there is the monkeys. Stephanie is babysitting a pet monkey. She comes to acquire many more monkeys over the course of the book. The monkey humor wasn't funny and couldn't shoulder the expectation of humor that comes with a Stephanie Plum book.<br /><br />Diesel could be an interesting character, but his role seems to be mostly the boosting of Stephanie's ego, which is already being hoisted by Ranger and Morelli. We get it, men want her, but most of Diesel's comments in the book are barely veiled innuendo. I'm intrigued to see what he may do on his own and will be checking out Wicked Appetites though, as he could have some great potential without the Stephanie distraction.<br /><br />Some characters felt off in this book. Tank becomes a chatterbox. The man would not shut up about his cats. I ignored it, thinking perhaps he's just obsessed with his new cats, but when it came time to talk to Stephanie or others about real matters, he still carried a conversation. This is very out of character for him.<br /><br />Plum Spooky is my least favorite Stephanie Plum book so far. Nothing seemed to work in this book. If you're really craving a Plum fix, this book may tide you over, but you may just want to move on to the next installment.seemed to work in this book.

B0029XFNA8|2.0|I was very disappointed with the Blu-ray version of this movie. There is an annoying graininess throughout the film. When I compared it to the 2-disc DVD set we already owned, the DVD was noticeably cleaner and more pleasing to the eye. I guess I would be tempted to assume that this is just an inherent problem with Blu-ray in that it's just so clear that it brings out the grains in the original film, but I also ordered the Blu-ray version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", and it looks great. This is a classic holiday film, but if you want the best quality version, get the 2 DVD set.
0345495004|2.0|After reading this book I wondered, How did she get this mess published?  A married woman with two children meets a rock star architect, falls in love, and is so consumed by her passion that she abandons her family and follows him to Europe.  One would think this much true drama would translate easily into a compelling novel.  But not in Ms. Horan's hands.  It states in the author interview at the back of my copy that she has been a reporter for many years.  Which is exactly how this book reads, like a long, long newspaper article.  It lacks all feeling.  (Let me restate that: The book is devoid of any feeling whatsoever.) The woman begins a passionate relationship with the artist (No particular passion described, but long conversations about the landscape ensue.)  When she abandons her children, she just says goodbye and gets on a train.  (No sense of being torn apart whatsoever.)  The woman and her children die at the end of the book but her lover barely sheds a tear.  This is one of the worst written books I've read in a long time.  Long strings of prepisitional phrases knit together to pass as sentences.  The author fails to create a relationship between the two main characters, extreme details about the buildings & his \\"vision\\" substitute for plot development.....oh....I could just go on and on.  Don't bother unless you're an aspiring architect.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|Ben Affleck did a good job directing this Heist film. Some other reviewers compare this film to Heat but there really isn't any comparison other than they are both movies about Bank Robbers and Law Enforcement. In Heat we have mature cops and mature Robbers, In the Town it's a young man's game. If anything The Town reminds me of Set it Off with men and the gang basically ends up the same way. Great cast especially Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm and the always excellent Chris Cooper. Affleck is in his element on his home turf and really shows off the beauty of Boston, the action is fast and furious yet realistic looking.  This film kept me engrossed and I enjoyed it just as much as I did Gone Baby Gone. Afleck is a Director that I am looking foward to seeing more work from.
159448385X|5.0|This is an excellent work of fiction! Let me first give you the basic synopsis of the book: It starts with the childhood of Maryam, a girl born out of wedlock in a city in Afghanistan, circa 1960. Some tragic incidents occur, after which her reluctant father and his wives pressure Maryam to marry a widowed man thirty years older than her. Of course, Maryam didn't want this fate, but the husband is at least reasonably nice in their society's standards--at first. Over the course of the book, he becomes cruel, hypocritical, and condescending, and eventually marries a second wife. There is an even larger age gap between him and the new bride, and his behavior patterns with this woman are pretty much the same. The two co-wives eventually create a partnership and rely on each other to try to escape the house and flee to northern Pakistan, where a lot of other Afghanis have been moving to evade the politics and war caused by the Soviets, mujahiddeen, and Taliban.<br /><br />As many others suggest, it is a real page turner. You come across many surprises while learning about the political climate of a country that people need to know more about these days. You find yourself rooting for the women in the story, and you might even tear up at some of the more emotional parts towards the end. For that reason, this is a must-read.<br /><br />There's one more thing I hope you take from this book that I don't think many reviewers have commented on: in this society, as in any other, there are good people, and there are bad people. Being a Pakistani woman myself, I'm annoyed that people assume that most of the women in this region are oppressed, because I've never felt that way. Maryam's father was a coward, and her husband was brutal. However, the other co-wife's father, as well as her love interest, were both kind men. Her father championed women's education, and encouraged her to follow her dreams. Having multiple wives is NOT the norm among Muslim families, and forced marriages are against Islamic doctrine. However, these instances do happen sometimes, usually among the less educated (as the antagonists in this story were largely uneducated). Rather than show Afghanis as practicing a completely backwards culture, I think this book really shows there needs to be more education here and anywhere else human rights are violated.<br /><br />It's certainly a story you'll remember for a long time, no matter how you feel about the plot itself.ic doctrine.

B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Bottom-Line: \\"The Band Perry\\" is yet another example of the Nashville hit machine, some are hits, some are misses, but all represent fresh new voices from the heartland.<br /><br />I am falling in love with the XM Satellite Radio installed my 2008 Cadillac CTS.  One of the reason I very seldom listen to commercial radio is well, the commercial part!  Far too many advertisements for my taste; I just start enjoying the music and sorry time for a long, long series of commercials!  And so the search for music begins.<br /><br />Not so with XM Satellite Radio.  Sure there are occasional announcement, but they have nothing at all to do with pitching stuff I do not need, want, or want to hear about; it's just music and not the same looped play lists now common on the conglomerate commercial broadcast radio stations .  It's on XM Satellite Radio that I first heard If I Die Young from a fresh new group out of Nashville, \\"The Band Perry.\\"  I like the track so much that I reserved the CD at the local library and so far I like very much what I am hearing.<br /><br />\\"The Band Perry\\" is Kimberly Perry (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano) and her two brothers: Reid Perry (bass guitar, background vocals) and Neil Perry (mandolin, drums, accordion, background vocals). The trio was signed by Republic Nashville in August 2009.  The group's debut and self-titled CD, \\"The Band Perry\\", was released in October 2010 and has so far spawned two singles: track No. 2 Hip to My Heart and track No. 3 If I Die Young, the latter of which reached number one on the Hot Country Songs charts and has rightly been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Single.<br /><br />The voice of The Band Perry is Kimberly Perry whose vocal style is a refreshing mixture of country twang and innocence, but it still needs some maturity in order to truly move the listener to emotion.  Unlike other C&W groups, \\"The Band Perry\\" strength does not lay in rich three-part harmonizing, indeed there is scare any; the trio's strong suit is the song writing and sharp, polished instrumentation.<br /><br />My favorite track on \\"The Band Perry\\" CD is track No.3 If I Die Young written by lead singer Kimberly Perry.  The track is a melancholy, but engaging song that is wonderfully simple and beautifully rendered.  I love the interplay of Ms. Perry's vocals and the fiddle throughout.  They are joined by the quintessential C&W instruments, the (sometimes) dueling banjos; the effect is akin to floating on a very relaxing body of water free of care...<br /><br />The rest of the CD is a mixture of fast and slow tracks but it on the slower more soulful track that \\"The Band Perry\\" really finds its grove.

B004132I20|4.0|Reinventing a popular culture character can be tricky business--what do you keep and what do you jetison to make it work in a different setting? Sherlock Holmes wasn't just a clever lad; he had many of the hallmarks of a sociopath--a brilliant sociopath working on the RIGHT side of the law. Although Arthur Conan Doyle didn't invent the detective genre (Edgar Allen Poe created the first detective to use deductive reasoning--or more accurately inductive reasoning ) but he perfected it assisting in the birth of an entire genre of fiction that has impacted every form of modern entertainment.<br /><br />In Stephen Moffat's (\\"Doctor Who\\") reinvention of Arthur Conan Doyle's brilliant, iconoclastic consulting detective Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) is brought firmly into the 21st century. Like Universal Studios brought Holmes into the modern era before in the 1940's with the films featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and Watson solving crimes during World War II in England. It was a stroke of genius on the part of the studio at the time as it made Holmes relevant once again.<br /><br />Moffat and his collaborators have once again taken the bold step of bringing Holmes into the modern age but also creating a Holmes that is every bit as contemporary as the time he lives in. Holmes meets Afganistan vet Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) through a mutual friend and the duo immediately hit it off. In \\"A Case in Pink\\" (an adaption of \\"A Study in Scarlet\\") Holmes is brought in by DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) to solve a series of perplexing suicides which turn out to be the work of an unusual serial killer. Holmes must find out how and why this serial killer picks his victims before he kills again.<br /><br />Featuring marvelous performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson, uses the opportunity to reinvent characters that could easily have become nothing more than pale imitations of previous performers from Rathbone to Jeremy Brett who was often considered the actor that most closely embodied Doyle's vision of Holmes. Moffat effortlessly integrates the story of the first meeting between Holmes and Watson into a complex, fascinating murder mystery that puts to shame most procedural shows. In fact as much as I enjoyed the recent theatrical film \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" with Robert Downey, Jr., THIS Sherlock is the superior of the two with much more complex and fascinating characters placed within a more complex interesting story that effectively takes elements from Doyle's own stories.<br /><br />Visually dazzling featuring top notch direction \\"Sherlock\\" takes an unusual approach to Holmes and how his mind works as well--we SEE the words that occur to Holmes as he is examining evidence. While this might shound awkward it works brilliantly allowing the scene to proceed without unnecessary exposition dialog that might slow down the action. It's a gimmick that always works because it reflects Holmes attempting to solve the case giving the technique context.<br /><br /> \\"Sherlock\\" looks quite nice with plenty of detail, a sharp, nice looking high def transfer. The only flaw that I can see are problems with aliasing in all three episodes. I also noticed that facial detail isn't quite as strong as a contemporary high def transfer but that could be due to the use of DNR to allow for a lower bit rate. \\"Sherlock\\" may not look perfect but the series still looks quite good.<br /><br />Audio puts dialog front and center but the 5.1 mix leaves a bit to be desired; while it is nicely done the mix isn't quite as immersively as I would expect for a recent program like \\"Sherlock\\". I could be wrong on that count of course--it simply could be choice on the part of the producers to have the sound like this. Either way, \\"Sherlock\\" looks and sounds quite good even if it isn't a demo quality presentation.<br /><br /> We get a commentary track on \\"A Case in Pink\\" and on the third episode of the series.

B004856SQ8|3.0|I pity the fool who expects the movie version of \\"The A-Team\\" to perfectly reflect the original TV series. A big, broad, messy love letter of a movie to the TV show \\"The A-Team\\" may be a narrative mess but it is entertaining and it's just like watching a tank crash...a car crash. Directed and co-written by Joe Carnahan (\\"Narc\\", \\"Smokin' Aces\\"), \\"The A-Team\\" works primarily because of the charm of the cast and the non-stop action.<br /><br />When Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson)and his group of U.S. Special Forces Airborne Rangers -\\"Face\\" (Bradley Cooper), \\"B.A.\\" (Quinton Jackson) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley of \\"District 9\\")are framed for stealing conterfeit plates in Iraq all four are court martialed and thrown into prison. The four find an unlikely ally in a rogue CIA agent named Lynch (Patrick Wilson)who helps them break out of prison to locate the plates and the man who stole them--Pike (Brian Bloom). The A-Team has to stay ahead of Face's former girlfriend Lt. Sosa (Jessica Biel)who with her team are hot on the trial of the team but suspects that they are innocent. The team must figure out where Pike is and the plates in order to exonerate themselves. Watch for an entertaining cameo from Jon Ham (\\"Madmen\\") at the conclusion of the film and the marvelous character actor Henry Czerny (\\"Mission: Impossible\\") who needs to be utilized better by Hollywood as he's a terrific character actor.<br /><br />The main flaw with the film is that the writers and director have to set up the entire premise AND break them out, resolve who framed them and keep it moving/entertaining the entire two hours. It's a daunting task and I'd never accuse someone of trying to stuff too much plot into a movie but with this much action it's very very difficult to try and set up action set pieces, develop characters and resolve a convoluted plot in one movie. If there had been a guarantee of a sequel they might have been able to carry their search for who set them up for other films and allowed a bit more breathing room for the plot.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"The A-Team\\" looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer and plenty of extras that include \\"Inside the Action\\" The Devil is in The Details\\" a commentary featuring the director who discloses everything from the fact that the scene involving the military city was built in a bit where they were in the process of building a Walmart to the use of CGI to remove moths from a scene that were circling around the bright lights. Periodically the audio commentary becomes a PIP with the director appearing along with animatics and/or behind-the-scenes footage.<br /><br />We also get a visual effects reel with before and after images and commentary. Deleted scenes are included as well as a gag reel for the film. There are some other featurettes that are included as well.<br /><br />\\"The A-Team\\" is a big, messy, explosive and entertaining flick even if the narrative sometimes gets lost in all the action. The big pay off at the end of the film works quite well. Although \\"The A-Team\\" may not have done well at the box office due to negative reviews, the film is bound to do well on home video with enough curious fans renting or buying the flick. I doubt that we'll see a sequel but the film doesn't do harm to the original film (unlike, say, the film version of \\"The Wild Wild West\\" which was just a complete disaster). \\"The A-Team\\" is worth at least a rental.ing room for the plot.

B00005LK94|4.0|A delightful story well acted.  Jeff Daniels, Anna Paquin, and the other characters do a good job. Nice music and scenery.  The baby geese running & turning in unison are fun to watch.    Warnings:         Gratuitous disdain for authority:                 A game officer is physically attacked by the heroes upon simply                 doing his job.                The heroes illegally break in and steal geese confined at the game                headquarters.        New age spirituality:                Father tells daughter that her deceased mother is \\"here\\", \\"next to                 you\\", \\"in the geese\\", \\"in the sky\\", \\"all around you\\", \\"she won't let                you down\\".                      Father lives with a lover (apparently) outside of marriage.        One of the heroes lies to game officer and border guard in order to solve dilemmas.        There's a smattering of cuss words, all of which are unnecessary to the story.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|Bless the Muppets. Their musical adaptation of Dickens' classic is perfect for young children and parents wanting to share the true meaning of Christmas.<br /><br />I preface I just finished writing a two-star review of [[ASIN:B003ZVJFFM Disney's A Christmas Carol]], a film I thought might supplant the Muppets version as our family's favorite Dickens adaptation. Unfortunately, Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, having failed to learn the lesson \\"less is more\\" created a jarring mess that lacks the charm needed for repeat viewings.<br /><br />Brian Henson directs his musical adaptation with an even tone (heartwarming and funny). Whether your children are familiar with the Muppets or not, the movie is accessible for young children (think ages 5 to 10) thanks to Gonzo the Great's gentle narration (as Charles Dickens). My sons could easily follow the story and understand the messages of love and good will toward all.<br /><br />The cast is a mix of Muppets and human actors with Michael Caine in the lead as Scrooge. Caine's Scrooge is kid-friendly, not so mean and cruel as to be nightmare-inducing. Yet, he manages a heartwarming transformation with each ghost visit that ultimately leaves Miss Piggy (as Bob Cratchit's wife, Emily) speechless.<br /><br />My sons (ages 8 and 6) first enjoyed this DVD in the comfort of our home. I think that might be a key reason why the movie received such harsh reviews when released in December 1992. This movie is a much better experience shared at home with parents and young children huddled together on the sofa than at a movie theater. This movie competed against [[ASIN:B0001I561E Aladdin]] and [[ASIN:B0029XFN9O Home Alone 2]], a film that hasn't aged well. Sadly, \\"Home Alone 2\\" was rereleased on Blu-Ray before either \\"Aladdin\\" or [[ASIN:B000ATQYT2 The Muppet Christmas Carol]]. I can only imagine that families with children of a mix of ages begrudgingly purchased tickets for the Muppets instead of Macaulay Culkin's sequel.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars. (One star dropped for the bungled packaging - the missing song - and the fact that no Blu-Ray version of the film exists).ungled packaging - the missing song - and the fact that no Blu-Ray version of the film exists).
B003W5C0VW|5.0|An excellent job of putting together the events leading up to, during and following this 1969 concert.  Perhaps not a significant moment in history but certainly an eye opener for the younger generation at the time.  For those of us who had other concerns - the Vietnam conflict, the nuclear arms race, and supporting a family to name a few - the 'over the top' descriptions of the impact of this Stone tour need to be taken with a grain of salt... The Stones learned from the tour and took a great deal of care to avoid the same mistakes again.
B003ZVJFFM|2.0|In the hands of Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, Ebenezer Scrooge's tale delivers moments of true emotion - frightening, heartbreaking and uplifting. Yet, neither the 3-D animation nor Carrey's multi-character act elevate this version to the status of a Christmas classic.<br /><br />I preface I'm writing this review as a father of two sons (ages 8 and 6). We popped popcorn, poured glasses of Arnold Palmer and slipped into our pajamas for a family movie night. Having recently enjoyed [[ASIN:B000ATQYT2 The Muppet Christmas Carol]], I hoped my sons could enjoy (and follow) a gloomier interpretation of Dickens' classic that followed the original story closer than I had expected.<br /><br />Zemeckis employs the performance-capture technique previously used in [[ASIN:B000Q7ZO8U The Polar Express]] and [[ASIN:B001AII4RM Beowulf]]. The animation provides some amazing visuals, making it possible for Scrooge to fly Victorian England or shrink to mouse size for an icicle ride across rooftops. The ghost of Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Future were exceptionally scary (my six-year jumped when Marley's visage first appeared on Scrooge's doorknocker). However, the animation distracts as much as it dazzles, especially during longer stretches of dialogue. Aside from the skeletal Scrooge, Zemeckis envisions the rest of the cast as a fleshy, pig-faced people whose ugliness is off-putting.<br /><br />Scrooge is an amalgamation of Carrey's previous roles. You'll see a sneer that echoes Count Olaf from [[ASIN:B0007PICAS Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]] and then hear a laugh reminiscent of The Grinch from [[ASIN:B002LMV7TS How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]. Carrey's performances as the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future are for vanity's sake. My six-year old detected the same actor played Scrooge and the Ghosts, a revelation that only served to pull him from the narrative.<br /><br />Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Bob Hoskins join Carrey in playing multiple roles. It is hard to understand why though because only Oldman, who portrays both Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit, delivers two unique and satisfying performances. Marley is gruesome (much more horrifying than the Ghost of Christmas Future), while Cratchit is endearing and childlike, especially so during his commute home on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />In summary, this movie is a mess and falls well short of being a Christmas classic. Dickens classic proves beyond the creative talents of Carrey and Zemeckis, who are unsure how to present this tale. Dark and gloomy dialogue is followed by [[ASIN:B0002MFGCI Tom and Jerry]] action scenes.<br /><br />Rating: Two stars.<br /><br />If you have young children, I recommend [[ASIN:B000ATQYT2 The Muppet Christmas Carol]] instead.d to understand why though because only Oldman, who portrays both Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit, delivers two unique and satisfying performances.

B003YBNRHU|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the Doobies´s latest offering. Some tunes are great (the ones w/ Michael McDonald on board - \\"Don´t Say Goodbye\\" comes to mind - and the moving bonus tracks). On the minus side, a few tracks are mediocre/ derivative.
B001VNB54A|4.0|It is a good series.  I am helped to understand what the series is about since I read the book \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\" and know a little bit about the war.    IF a person didn't have a history background, the scenes, battles, characters, etc, might seem disjoined and suspect.    From my understanding of these battles, the Marines, etc, my feeling is that this series is EXTREMELY accurate and unvarnished.    If a person wants to know more about Peleliu, they might want to read the book \\"Devils Anvil, the assault on Peleliu\\"    Good series but might be disturbing.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is a bombastic, pretentious, middlebrow soap opera that struggles hard to say something profound about art and women, but manages to peddle hateful lies about both art and women. Men who've read too much Freud and have no understanding of women and teen Goth girls who wear black fingernail polish will embrace \\"Black Swan\\" passionately.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" has no rise in tension, no complication of plot. The entire film is a bleak, dreary, depiction of a schizophrenic who hallucinates and wears nice ballet costumes. Nina (Natalie Portman) is never depicted as having any normal life or healthy relationships the audience might care about her losing. From start to finish, the film features tight close-ups on Portman's anguished face as she careens through one hallucination, and one dance rehearsal, after another. Since Nina's world is so relentlessly bleak, horrific - and unreal - from the start, we can't invest in her. We can't care about her losing her hold on sanity, because she is shown from the get-go to have no hold on sanity. We can't care about her losing her friendships, or her hope, because she has no friendships and she has no hope. Nothing changes. Nothing is at stake. Nina is as big of a messy basket case an hour into the film as she was at the beginning. The endless close-ups on Nina's anguished face get old really fast.<br /><br />The filmgoer comes to understand disastrously quickly that Aronofsky's bag of tricks is limited. The sets are all in stiflingly monotonous black and white, no doubt to show how deep of a film this is. Since viewers don't know which scenes are real and which are Nina's hallucinations, it's impossible to invest in them.<br /><br />The one bright spot in the film is Vincent Cassel, who relishes a bath in smarm as a ballet troupe's sadistic, manipulative, and very naughty director. He's the only one who has any fun, and God bless him for it. He could probably dance on the deck of the Titanic. With his French bonhomie and predatory amorality, Cassel is a cross between Maurice Chevalier and George Sanders.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" tells us that women are fragile and neurotic and if they do anything remarkable it makes them crazy. Craziness, in women, oddly parallels male sex fantasies. When women go crazy they have catfights with other women, including their moms, they torture their bodies and others in bloody, gory ways, they begin to pleasure themselves in visually artistic ways, and then they engage in same-gender erotic expression. Most of the women involved are young, fit, and minimally clad. How convenient for any kinky men watching this movie!<br /><br />Is this film misogynist? Ask yourself this, would Aronofksy make a parallel film about a football linebacker who goes nuts because being a football linebacker is a big stress? Yeah, I didn't think so, either. Of course this film is misogynist. \\"Black Swan\\" is a throwback to soft-core women's prison flics and misogynist film noir like 1947's \\"Possessed,\\" that depicted Joan Crawford driven mad by passion.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" struggles really hard to say big things about art: that the drive for perfection can drive you mad, that artists sacrifice for their art, that art and madness are virtually identical. This viewer just cannot believe that someone suffering from full blown schizophrenia could become the prima ballerina of a high powered NYC ballet troupe. Ballet is not the whim of an afternoon. Ballet demands a lifetime of showing up on time, getting along with colleagues, and successful performance. Someone as ill as Nina could not have carried this off.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" wants us to believe the old, crude, invidious lie that art equals madness. It doesn't. There have been some high-profile artists who were also mentally ill, but that the public tends to focus on these people doesn't make art and madness the same thing. For most artists, art means years of unpaid hard work, dedication, self-discipline, and self-restraint. The creation of powerful art demands that the artist be, not crazier than the bulk of the population, but saner. Not buying into popular lies arouses envy and suspicion. Some people who hate art and artists are often simply envious of art and artists. And some people really don't understand art or artists and so they feel threatened and enraged by art and artists. It is these people who have given us the lie that art and madness are identical. Aronofsky doesn't do art or artists any favors by peddling this lie.hat the artist be, not crazier than the bulk of the population, but saner. Not buying into popular lies arouses envy and suspicion.

0920668372|5.0|Robert Munsch books have been translated into twelve languages and produced on cassette, video, CD ROM, television and stage. In 1991 Robert Munsch won the Canadian Booksellers Association's \\"Author of the Year\\" award.<br /><br />Robert wrote Love You Forever after he had two stillborn babies. For him, it was a fantasy about the life his kids would never have. He wrote it just for himself and didn't think of it as a book. Much later he started using it at storytellings and he was surprised at the response. He then decided to try to publish it.<br /><br />'Love You Forever' by Robert Munsch is the most touching children's book I have ever read. I think the book works because it lets us reflect on how as we grow into adults the tables are reversed and we begin to care for our parents. It is  also the book that has sold the most copies of any of Munsch's books. In 1988 it sold 1,000,000 and has been selling about 1,000,000 a year ever since.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|So what would happen if aliens came to our planet? And what happens when they are potentially dangerous, but happen to need us? District 9 happens. Of course we would create a quarantine, try to control them, and wind up exploiting them as much as possible. Especially when there are weapons that they can use against us. We would tromp around in the disguise of good will only to keep ourselves safe. It's not a surprise. It's self-preservation and one of the reasons us humans have gotten as far as we have. Still, it's important to critique these ideas and District 9 does just that.<br /><br />It is a story of alien life coming to this world. Their broken mother ship hovers over the city of Johannesburg. The government there eventually gave the go ahead to break into the ship and what they found were the starving masses of aliens living in refuse. They needed help. Unfortunately, they are not like us. They are also potentially dangerous. This mixture forces the government's hand to make District 9 where the aliens, nicknamed \\"Prawns\\" because they look like and \\"act\\" like the bottom feeding aquatic namesake, live relatively separated from the human world. The only contact they have are with dangerous gangs or with the committee created by the government to control District 9.<br /><br />The story gets complicated as one of those committee members, Wikus Van De Merwe, gets \\"infected\\" with a substance that systematically begins to transform him from human to alien. The committee wants nothing more than to harness him, examine him, and in the process kill him. He begins, therefore, a journey taking him straight into District 9 where he finds himself entrenched in the life of one particular alien named \\"Christopher\\" and his little boy.<br /><br />Wikus is initially a rather hard character to like, but through the transformation of his body we also transform our view of him. This does not come easy or quickly. He shows his human colors by working with self preservation throughout the movie, making us doubt what we should feel about him (as we should). One thing is for sure, our view of the aliens is steadfast.<br /><br />With the context of the movie heavily steeped in how we, as humans, deal with differences in our society this film becomes a critique of all living life, not just aliens. How we treat, view, and act to those who are different than us can never be fully understood until we take their places. When we do, it is only then, that we can grasp the gravity of the situation. Even so, some of us recognize these issues, but they are too big for individuals to handle alone. The movie continually examines this societal norm while giving us an action packed, interesting, and very different film from the regular box office hits.<br /><br />My main upsets with the film is its seemingly desperate cling to gore. They put so much of it in! It feels as if they were worried the story itself would not carry the movie well enough so they added the grotesque to make it more interesting and likable. Though I am not one to shy away from the occasional cringing moment I got bored with the extensive use throughout the movie. Because of this heavy handed use of violence Tania seemed oddly out of place with her continuous love for Wikus. It's touching, but completely out of place in the broad spectrum of the film. If they had developed that relationship further by giving them more screen time or scenes I believe it would have fit better. Otherwise, this film is a diamond in the rough. Rare and original. It remains open ended, as most movies these days do, but it is a good stand alone film as well if not for the critiques it provides.us doubt what we should feel about him (as we should).

0812548094|4.0|I have to admit, I read \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" and came away unimpressed. I saw a story beneath the poor up and down event roller coaster that could come to fruition if Goodkind had worked just a tad harder at it. I couldn't relate to the characters because of their bipolar like tendencies. I feared I had started a series I was going to fight day in and day out. I was wrong. By the end of the first book I found myself curiously interested in these characters and their next step on their adventure and \\"Stone of Tears\\" certainly delivers.<br /><br />Instead of finding this as more of a story about Richard I found it focused more on Kahlan. She does much more than Richard does over the course of the entire novel and we really get a taste of what it is to be a Mother Confessor who is in love and gets happiness snatched from her viciously. Richard does do his part, but it seems much less and much later in the story. Kahlan is the world changer for a while in this book and I think Goodkind fights this a bit too hard at the end where he drastically switches back to Richard. It's as if he realizes that the story has to be about Richard. It also seems a bit rushed (but after over 900 pages who can blame him?). Which is truly my only major complaint.<br /><br />Now that I'm used to his bipolar tendencies for characters I am seeing much more of the story and I absolutely love how small things become more and more important as time goes on. It's small changes in the past that effect the greatest things in the future and Goodkind jeopardizes on this idea greatly. Some of the predictions are still obvious, but some come right out of left field and I am thrilled with this change. I no longer felt like I knew what was going to happen.<br /><br />Another change in the book that I enjoyed was that it was a history lesson in disguise. We get a lot more information on what happened in the Old World and the New, why and how this world we are in works, etc. Couple this with quite a deal of action scenes and emotional times of hope and despair makes for a quick and easy read.<br /><br />I am also curious as to how he continues the series since the ending is so concrete. It makes me want to read the next and I am truly engrossed at this point. There is quite a deal of critique hidden between the lines. That of societies, power, corruption, understanding of words and thoughts, good and evil, differing views of life, balance. Much can be analyzed along with just having a decently good read in your lap.ional times of hope and despair makes for a quick and easy read.

He covers every point on the topic he's talking about the good and the bad, and unlike most self help books he shows you the data and the science behind it and allows you to make the decision on its validity or legitimacy as a practice. I thought it was a great book, super fun to read, and the slow carb diet really works along with cold showers, its awesome, buy it.
0553381687|5.0|first off, the first book is the slowest and it takes a bit to understand how each point of view starts to intertwine with the others. once you grasp that, you are good as gold. however, if you get through the first book i urge you to get into the others because you will find what it is that so many people are loving. i think it's wonderful to read books that make us look deeper into our own selves and really question our own morals and values given certain circumstances. some things we know for certain, but others we cannot truly say because we haven't experienced it; we can say what we would like to do, but would we really? (hmmm?)<br /> I'm almost done reading the series for the second time through and i find it is very much more realistic in it's approach to our true human nature and inclinations than the typical fantasy series where the characters are very stereotypical and what you see is (most likely) what you expect. as you read on in this series you get to have a deeper look at who these people are, how they got to be the way they are; you watch them change and grow as the books go on and you come to empathize with them because you understand them from the human standpoint. each character may sway closer to the good or the bad respectively, however each character also has their gray area, some more than others. there are a lot of moments that surprise you and make you wonder where they really stand in terms of good or evil.<br /><br />i clearly remember the first time reading the series and the moment when i realized \\"we aren't in kansas anymore\\"! it is an\\"R\\"-rated epic series, so if sex and swearing bothers you, it may not be for you. this series is not for the fainthearted people who love their characters and thinks they should all be safe and alive at the end. this series is not for people who don't like to not know who the real enemy is (or if there is more than one). this goes beyond what you know of fantasy books. once you get into them, you will be amazed at the intricate and shocking nature of the story. i can't fathom how to write something of this magnitude. i highly recommend the series!e intricate and shocking nature of the story. i can't fathom how to write something of this magnitude. i highly recommend the series!
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I am a 7th grade reading teacher and wanted to find a movie to compare and contrast with the novel, The Giver by Lois Lowry.  The Truman show was just that!   Truman and Jonas have a lot in common and their \\"utopian\\" society does too.  Very good movie!!! Very creative!
0374290024|1.0|Look at North America,  Europe, the Mid-East, and Asia from 1000 bc to 15 AD and what do you find?  The life of the common man being fairly consistent; short and brutal with life expectancy hovered around 30 years old.  Then in the 1700s this all changes in one backwater country the Netherlands and later England.  Life expectancy takes off and continues to take rise, it is around 78 in the US now.  The author completely ignores this metric, instead focusing on population density and social structure, items difficult to measure.  For example has Harappa been fully excavated?  I have seen population  estimates ranging from 250,000 to 500,000 for Harappa?  How can the author base develop levels on this metric when the estimates can be so far off?  He could use life expectancy as this data are easy to obtain, but of course this would not give the answer the author wants.    When you look at world history prior to around 1700 what do you see? Rises in population as new agricultural methods or new trade routes are discovered.  Life expectancy goes up for awhile, population levels go up resources are over-used and populations levels off back at where they started. growth is extensive but follows a malthusian pattern. Look at capital investement in Rome, Persia, Gothic Europe, India or Cambodia prior to 1700s.  What do you see? palaces and temples. Take a tour of Seville what do you see from the period prior to 1700?  A huge cathedral, no factories.  Now take a tour of modern day Tokyo, Shanghai or New York.  What are the largest buildings? In Shanghai? huge office buildings, and also some of the worlds largest factories, a single one covers several city blocks.     Before the 1700s society spent more capital on non productive consumption items after 1700 the shift was to invest capital in factors of production.  This change took place later in the east than the west.  Prior to the 1700s cultural development was rather uniform across the globe. With higher levels investment, you have higher levels of income and higher standards of living.  You have more intensive use of growth.      The question is why this pattern of investment changed in England and the Netherlands before it did in China.

B00428CPUY|1.0|Very few songs were performed that I recognized. Music was arcane and did not venture far from basic blues. The concert was a total disappointment. Could only be appreciated by die hard blues purists. In my humble opinion the buying the dvd was a waste of my money!
B004APVI1G|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters in Imax 3D, and I was astounded by the visuals.  The atmosphere was breathtaking, and the animation of the owls was superbly done.  The musical score is incredible for an animated film.  This is one of the best animated films I have seen, and as for it being CGI... this is what CGI was made for.  I was more eager for the release of this film to Blu-Ray than any other film this year.    What I truly enjoyed about Legend of the Guardians is that it is not just another dumbed-down children's movie.  It does not look down on the intelligence of the audience.  There's no blood and gore, but the owls do wield some scary weaponry and participate in some intense battle scenes, and the tone of the story can be rather dark at times.  The danger to the characters is real, and there's a good deal of tension and suspense.  It reminded me of some of the older animated films like The Secret of NIMH in the sense that the movie takes itself seriously.  That's a refreshing change from the usual treatment that animation receives.  When I learned that Zach Snyder (300) directed the movie, I understood why, and he did a superb job.  I wish more film makers would take this approach.    After seeing the movie in the theater, I became interested in the books and I have read the first four so far.  If you have read the books and not seen the movie you will notice some definite differences.  Some characters are added, some are not present, and some have undergone some changes.  The story is based around the first three books, and much of the story in the books has been condensed.  This is the result of the screenplay adaptation process.  There's simply no way to fit the entirety of the books verbatim into a film.  The movie would be over three hours, and even at 90 minutes, the production cost is expensive.  There's also a matter of pacing the film for the audience, and having a complete story for a single film.  A sequel is always possible, but the screenwritersknow that they need to tell a story without the necessity for a sequel.  I would have preferred a longer film myself with some more fleshing out of Soren's time in the Ga'Hoole tree, but as it is, the story is fine and quite enjoyable.  If you have seen the movie but have not read the books I highly recommend them.  They are written for older children, but adults can easily enjoy them, and after having read the books and watching the film again I was able to appreciate the film even more for knowing some of the smaller details better.    I recently encountered a superb deal on a 3D-capable Samsung plasma TV and 3D Blu-Ray player.  Tonight I watched this movie in 3D, and it was just like being in the theater again.  The visual quality is just incredible.  If you have a 3D-capable home theater, this is the version you want.  It includes a 2D Blue-Ray copy as well as standard DVD, so if you've been considering upgrading to 3D sometime in the near future then go for this version.  It's worth it if you like the 3D experience, and it's one of only a few 3D movies available at this time.    In regards to Charles Solomon's official review of this movie... potential buyers, ignore it.  Read the customer reviews instead of this recycled movie-critic drivel.  Amazon, if you intend to actually sell products like movies, please find people to review them that actually want to sit down and watch them, or at least have an open mind when they do so.  Solomon's review sounds like he was forced to sit through a movie he didn't want to watch in the first place and then had nothing nice to say about it as a result.  I wager that he's being honest in the sense that he personally didn't like the movie, but most of us feel differently about the film, and reviews like that certainly don't do much to help your sales.

It reminded me a lot of myself growing up (except somewhere along the line he took a right turn and I took a left). There are some brilliant moves he took to get to where he is today. I found the book very inspiring. As an eCommerce Director myself, Tony has given me inspiration to reach for the stars!

B000028U0Y|5.0|I just finished listening to this old vinyl record for the upteenth time.I never tire of it and from glancing at the reviews many others feel the same.It's hard to believe this was recorded over 40 years ago in 1968.My album is an original recording and it is so good to hear the voices of Johnny and June in those earlier days.<br /> The discussions between Cash and his audience of prisoners result in a haunting memory of what it was to actually go into a prison and play and record their music and the reaction of the prisoners.<br /> If one were to try to come up with the top 10 Country Music albums of all time;it would almost be a certainty that this one be included.<br /> Rather than the typical \\"liner notes\\" found on the back of an album cover;there is an extensive hand printed message by Johnny wherein he talks about the whole world of prison and prisoners and what he makes of it.After reading these notes,the reader is left with the impression that Cash put his heart and soul into his music and believed what he was singing about.His music was truly a message and not just something he did for a living or the money and fame.That is why he had such a large following and why his music has lived so long and why we will continue to listen to it for a long time.That is why he deserves the title \\"A Legend\\".

B002ZG980U|1.0|This film is ridiculous, confused, and adolescent.  A ridiculous premise.  Confused development.  An explosion every 15 seconds.  A movie that seems to have been made by adolescents on LSD for adolescents on LSD.  I have three graduate degrees and I was totally lost halfway through the film.  I know this film has been a blockbuster and that makes me shudder for American culture.

B001EAWME2|5.0|The movie Halloween(1978) by John Carpenter is usually regarded as the grandaddy of all the slasher films. The reality is that Halloween borrowed a lot from this Canadian classic. Everyone look at the opening scenes of Black Christmas and compare them to Halloween. The camera is placed on the killer, we get the killer's pov. In Black Christmas we see the killer \\"Billy\\" climbing up the wall and finding his way into the sorority house. Much the same way that we see the killer's pov in the opening of Halloween. In fact the beginning AND ending of both films are almost EXACTLY the same. I've talked about the beginning, now the ending. In both movies the endings have open-ended endings where the killer is still around, still intact after the entire movie is over, alive to kill another day and in another movie.     Halloween went on to become a franchise but Black Christmas was for the most part forgotten. It has gotten more credit recently and there was even an unnecessary remake in 2006. But the original from 1974 remains one of the best horror movies ever made. This movie is great due to its plot, direction and cast. The cast includes a young Olivia Hussey and a young Margot Kidder as sorority sisters. The cast includes the rest of the sisters as well as some of their boyfriends and their hilarious sorority mom. The sorority mom, Mrs Mac(played by Marian Waldman), is a wonderful character. She is a foul-mouthed alcoholic mom who runs a pretty loose ship. But the sisters seem to love her anyway! The sorority girls have a lot in common with Mrs Mac especially Margot Kidder's character, Barb, Barb is also an obscene drunk. She goes to a police station and fools a dimwitted cop into writing a sexually explicit word into his report. Barb also gives alcohol to a little kid that the sisters have agreed to host for a Christmas party! Olivia Hussey's character is the straight-laced Jess, who has problems of her own. Jess is pregnant, her boyfriend is a wannabe concert pianist who seems a little un-hinged. For a while it looks like he is our killer \\"Billy\\".     Black Christmas does a great job of developing its killer Billy. Billy is deeply disturbed and he shows it by constantly calling the sorority house and making bizarre obscene calls. Billy is much more frightening than the slashers who came later like Michael Myers and Jason from Friday the 13th. Billy is very believable. There is nothing really supernatural about him. What's really scary about Billy is that he seems as smart as he is crazy! He brazenly kills women right in front of the cops' collective noses, yet they are helpless to stop him.       Black Christmas is the Grandaddy of All Slasher Films. It is a much scarier movie than all the slasher films that came after it too. It is a very creepy and atmospheric movie  that is good for multiple viewings. In fact you want to get a copy of this film in the format of your choice just as soon as you can. It deserves a place in the library of any film buff as a very important part of film history.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Just like the original Tron, Tron:Legacy will go down in history as a groundbreaking classic. It's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The special effects, the story and the acting from Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde are top notch. Above all the true star of Tron:Legacy is the score by Daft Punk. Everyone knows how great a fan of the original film they are. They take that love for the first film and translate it to the new film in a very beautiful way. The original film was a product of it's time, the 1980's and it's score by Walter \\"Wendy\\" Carlos, also a product of it's time. Not only does the soundtrack make homage to the original, but it takes 80's synth and makes it fresh and new. Do not hesitate to see the film and most definitely do not hesitate to buy this soundtrack. It's classic.

0060899220|4.0|If you're looking for a peek into the kitchen and how things were for a guy who blundered into greatness, this is the book for you. You'll see the good, the bad, and the really great, even when it is forged by foul-mouthed, drug fueled demons. Therein lies the honesty of the text, written by a guy who's willing to tell all, name a few names, and take his lumps.<br /><br />I wish I had read this book 10 years ago. Anyway, I was well pleased to finally enjoy this chronicle of Bourdain's rise through the restaurant ranks. His frankness about his experiences and the blunt look at what goes on in the kitchen earns him my highest marks. The book is quite a page turner with a few clunky interruptions. What is perhaps most striking is a chapter near the end where Bourndain visits another kitchen that runs like a Swiss watch as opposed to his managed pressure cooker. He deserves credit for acknowledging (unlike so many others in the uppity cooking world) that his is not the only way, that there are others who succeed using different methods.<br /><br />If only someone would write a comparable book about politics!

B002ZG99QS|4.0|Tron Legacy is a visually dazzling movie with excellent music and an easy to follow plot. I recommend the movie for these reasons. Jeff Bridges reprises his role as Kevin Flynn. He also plays the evil Clu. Clu is a computer program that looks exactly It is interesting to see Jeff Bridges play both characters. The plot is simple. Flynn has been trapped in a digital world for twenty plus years. He has a son named Sam who finds his long lost father and tries to get him out of this virtual world. I love the visual effects of the movie. The light cycle races are neat to watch and so is the light jet.  Another scene that I liked watching involved Garrett Hedhund being stripped of his clothes with one finger and instantly clad in a black body suit. I also love watching the light disc battles in the film. Daft Punk is a music group that scores the film. They provide the movie with a pulsating techno sound that I like very much.  There are also classic songs by Journey and The Eurythmics played in the movie too.  These songs still sound great The lovely actress Olivia Wilde plays Quorra. She is the surrogate daughter of Kevin Flynn. She also becomes Sam's ally as through the digital world. Tron Legacy is an entertaining two hours at the movies.
B0040QYROK|2.0|I'm not going to be leaping on the bandwagon full of folks singing the praises of this KINO \\"restoration\\" of METROPOLIS. Of course I'm thrilled to see so many missing scenes put back into the film but the quality of the \\"new\\" material is so poor that it is almost sad to watch. I fully understand that this 16mm print contained horrible damage and I am aware that no 35mm negative exists of this material, nevertheless, the so called restoration of this new material is sub par. I listened carefully to the explanations provided by the film's restorer and I'm not buying it for a second. The decision to crop the new material is not an elegant solution to a tricky problem. Blowing the footage up to match the size of the previous footage would have worked much better in most instances and been far less distracting. While I understand that no actual cleaning of the film can be done, there are much better digital alternatives available than what KINO used here. Of course, that sort of digital restoration would require a great deal more money and time and I suspect that in a few years we will see KINO issue just that sort of thing (with the few minutes of footage that are currently considered too damaged to repair miraculously included). This current release feels sort of like a rush job to me. I will say that the original score is spectacular and has never sounded better than it does here.     The extras included on this expensive disc are not up to par either. There is an hour long documentary that is more unfocused than much of the \\"restored\\" material in the film. Did I really want a lesson in German abstract art and archetecture in a METROPOLIS restoration documentary? Oddly, the documentary spends only a scant 5 minutes on the actual process of restoring the new footage and the rest of it is a poorly made rehash of the making of . . . whatever popped into the documentarians mind. I suspect so little time is spent on the restoration aspect because very little time was spenton the restoration itself. Just a year after the footage was found this new version was having a theatrical debut. Certainly a film in the deplorable state evidenced in this version needs considerably more time than that. The documentary also takes frequent slams at American distributor Paramount for their initial cutting of the film, overlooking the fact the Germany also cut the film just four months after its disastrous first theatrical run. If not for the excellent preservation of the Paramount negative, no first generation negative would exist for METROPOLIS at all. Of course, Germany might have been able to hang onto their own negative materials if theirs had not been bombed out of existance during that curious little attempt at world domination . . . nevertheless the documentary implies that it is all America's fault for the ruin of METROPOLIS.     The disc also includes an interview segment with Paula Felix-Didier who discovered the complete print in Argentina. It's an excellent interview. A trailer for the re-release is included and those are the only extras in this edition unless you count the booklet (which is again mostly a rehash of the previous edition booklet with very little focus on the actual restoration effort). The disc comes in a striking lenticular slip case.     Does the new footage make METROPOLIS a better film? Yes, some of it does. The HEL sequence between Rotwang and Joh Frederson adds a new motivation to both characters and the sequences of Georgy exploring his new life under the watchful gaze of Frederson's henchman offers a worthwhile subplot. The rest of the new material is mostly extended reaction shots and bits of running around. All in all, it dosen't change the film as much as you might expect.     While I'm so thrilled to see this new version of METROPOLIS I can't help but feel very cheated and I am entirely unconvinced that this was the best that it can look. If the German's would give up their stranglehold on the copyright of this film (they attempted to have the film TAKEN OUT OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN THE US, were struck down in the court, and are currently appealing) and give the restoration of this film to someone else I think we could see a much better version. This is especially sad since they did such a remarkable job on NOSFERATU (another film where no negative exists, only damaged prints). They should give this to James Cameron and see what he could do with it. I suspect it would look much better than it does in this sad state.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I have seen it 5 times now, bought the dvd too. The action was gerat and the characters were just lethal.

B000005JA8|5.0|I swore I would never be lured into the big switch of CD technology. Then I spotted releases of Trout Mask Replica, Lick My Decals off Baby and Absolutely Free at the local record store (the latter two having taken me some time to track down as used lps).  That was over 20 years ago and only the Zappa disc is available in a reasonably remastered release that almost borders on the original analog quality.  (The Decals disc I bought my not be sonically superior, but it's a pricey collectible at this point.)    Admittedly I more admire this classic work than keep it in heavy rotation in the car stereo.  I can't think of any other album that so effectively re-orients the way your mind perceives music, all music, while establishing the regimen for true artistic cult.  Anybody who takes their music seriously owes it to themselves to experience this bolt of original genius.    The gracious Gail Zappa has mentioned the eminent release of the never before issued original Bat Chain Puller.  It ranks with Trout Mask and Decals as the Captain's most significant works.  (Meanwhile, the man's entire catalogue deserves your attention, while we wait on a newly mixed version of the long unavailable Decals)
030746363X|5.0|To preface this review, I am only about half of the way through the book because I am taking my time to do some research of my own so I can begin to try out some of Tim's methods safely on myself.  That being said, I am rather amazed at the low reviews being given to this book.  While I agree that a lot of the information included in the book could have been found on the internet or through personal trainers and physicians, the fact is that a lot of the information here I would have never even though of researching.  I don't necessarily agree with some of his views on pleasuring women, but he does an amazing job of bringing up information on diet and has some good perspectives for beginners on body recomposition.  I believe that this book, like many of it's type, are more geared towards the average person than those that are already benching 500 lbs and maintaining single digit bodyfat.  I have found the methods he has detailed in the body recomposition portions of the book to be very interesting and this is the first time I have read a book that actually makes me excited to start a diet.  Some of you have said that this is nothing more than paleo rebranded, but guess what...I have no idea what paleo is and would have probably continued to not know (or care) what it is if it were not for your reviews.  If it is the same diet and it works, great!  I wish someone would have brought it up before and been a little better with their marketing of it.  I look forward to testing the methods myself and plan to do everything I can to become a healthier person.  The way Tim has presented this information has inspired me and I if I see the results he promises, I will shout his message to the rooftops.  If I follow this diet without fail and see no benefit, then I will come back and change my review.  But for now, at the very least it is an enjoyable book to read and it has inspired me to get myself and my family on the road to being in the best shape of our lives.  I think thatis worth a measly $15.  Hell, you can't even get lunch for that these days.  With all the money that some people spend on personal trainers and gyms, you would think it would be worth it to find out the information contained in this book.  If you already know how to do the things he describes in the book, you shouldn't have bought it.  For everyone else like me who is tired of playing the calories in/calories out game and not seeing good results, I hope you do buy it.

030746363X|4.0|I got this book as a review  copy. I was looking forward to the book because Ferriss's first book was such a novelty. Ferriss's specialty seems to be creating ideas that you really can't carry out in real life, but they give you a lot of ideas.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas aren't especially original. Ferriss does experiment with himself, testing ideas he's read/. He's not carrying out scientific studies and he doesn't claim to be doing so. All results come with probabilitie; they don't work on everyone. So, Ferriss asks, what works for him?<br /><br />I can't imagine more than a few people will have the dedication to implement Ferriss's programs,especially regarding food. He doesn't deliver simple recipes. He recommends specific supplements but he emphasizes that you need to be careful when taking them.<br /><br />The food recommendations seem extreme; they're recommended for fast and presumably safe weight loss.They're not original. Just about everyone's heard of avoiding the \\"white\\" foods.<br /><br />I sleep soundly and I find Ferriss's sleep recommendations counter-intuitive. The rest of the book didn't seem new and I leave comments on his weight-lifting suggestions to the experts.<br /><br />So...why four stars and not three, or even two? The best part of the book comes when Ferriss expresses his skepticism about medical journals. He includes an appendix on how to read and evaluate reports. As he says, most news articles distort findings of studies by presenting relative statistics. He adds a handful of ways a researcher can present findings - borderline ethical and a little scary.<br /><br />Ferriss's style is entertaining in a Gen Y sort of way. At one point he says the book is heavy enough to \\"club a baby seal,\\" a metaphor that didn't do much for me.<br /><br />Read or skim to get a sense of what the fuss is about, but most readers will have enough sense to add a caveat, \\"Don't try this at home.\\"

031603438X|5.0|The pros and cons of this book have been debated above. I loved Keith's account of the early Stones and in particular his descriptions of their sojourn in Tangiers, Anita's erotic ministrations in the back seat of the Bentley, tripping at the Villa Medici. That entire section, about 100 pages, captured a magical period with such great success that I would not have thought it possible. It was also great fun learning about how certain songs and lyrics came about. Guitar players (like me) will love learning about his various tunings and tricks of recording. I always wondered how on earth he got that dry-as-sand tone on the guitars at the beginning of Street Fighting Man and now I know.      As Mick sang, \\"All my friends are junkies.\\" And they were. This former choir boy lived a famously dissolute life. Mr. Richards was a heroin addict for a long time and drugs played a very big role in his life -- and in his music. He frequently used drugs for fuel -- cocaine and heroin, mostly. Who knew that on an ounce bottle of pharmaceutical cocaine, Merck described their product on the label in such nosewatering terms as \\"big, puffy crystals\\"? He describes how heroin allowed him to work and focus for nine days straight without sleep. (\\"Unless you make bold moves, you never f****** get anywhere.\\") While not the lifestyle for everyone --and he states several times \\"don't try this at home!\\" -- that's just how he worked. Those who also use drugs for work -- and you know who you are -- now have the benefit of his expertise on the subject.  And for those who complain that he goes on too long about hard drugs, yes, kicking heroin is not nearly as much fun to read about as scoring hash from Achmed in the Kasbah, but this book is about his life, warts and all. Frank, extremely intelligent and ultimately a very sweet person, Keith chose not to apologize for what he did and who he is. Good on ya, Keef. Great book.

0385342047|2.0|I waited in anticipation for this book as the Shopaholic Series has consisted of some of my all-time favorite books; this one, however, will not be added to the list! It starts off okay and has potential. Minnie is a spoiled, ill-mannered brat, and Becky is now both a shopaholic and a mother in denial. The main plot of the book starts off being all about finding a way to curb Minnie's ways. However, it takes a random turn and the focus is actually taken completely off of Minnie and put onto Becky planning an extravagant surprise birthday party for Luke. The book becomes chapter after chapter of her worrying about this stupid party. It's not funny, just annoying. I really couldn't have cared less about the party, but I pressed on hoping something interesting would happen. It didn't. Well, by the end of the book, Minnie is magically rehabilitated into the perfect child, yet there is not explanation as to how she suddenly got that way.

Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of details in this book. And, as I'm now discovering, many of the links to \\"special extra content\\" are just re-directs to cool YouTube videos... some of which don't even work!    This book is a series of fascinating examples of what the human body can do, but it's short on the details of practical implementation. Instead, it's a bunch of \\"wow!\\" stories with some arrows in the right directions.    For most readers, I think this book can be a fun curiosity, and even an inspirational fire-up, but not a stand-alone practical tool.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|There are plenty of reviews for this soundtrack, so I will briefly offer the opinions of a Sci-Fi / Industrial & Classical music fan, with the recommendation that you also read some of the other excellent reviews.  Given that TRON: Legacy is about life literally inside the electronic world, how appropriate is it that Amazon offered a digital copy of the CD liner notes with the mp3 album?  Normally I like to buy hard copies to get the liner notes of pieces of work that I find myself wanting to listen to in their entirety.  Based on the samples (which are excellent) offered here, I knew I liked enough of the tracks that I wanted the entire album.  The bonus of getting the CD liner notes in a digital format made my decision easy.<br /><br />After downloading the album, there were a number of tracks that immediately appealed to me.  While I am a fan of industrial music (and classical music as well ... I know, it seems like an odd fit, but it is actually pretty common amongst musicians), I was never into Daft Punk's lighter weight electronic music.  They did an amazing job with the Tron: Legacy soundtrack!<br /><br />I've listed a number of tracks I recommend you sample (the samples are representative of what I like about the tracks).  I've also expanded upon what I like about a few of these.<br /><br />Recommended Tracks:<br />* Recognizer<br />* Rinzler<br />* The Game Has Changed<br />* Overture<br />* The Grid<br />* Outlands<br />* End of Line<br />* Arena<br />* Derezzed<br /><br />The opening track, overture, has an Aaron Copland feel to it (specifically his [[ASIN:B000003CSW Copland: Appalachian Spring; Rodeo; Fanfare for the Common Man]]).  To put this into words, I've always felt that Copland's modern era classic music beautifully invokes an optimistic sense of space and exploration that is easily associated with North America's wide expanses.  What an excellent way to begin the soundtrack.<br /><br />As a fan of industrial music, the concept of using spoken word to begin a song or even throughout is common place.  Many artists do this early in their album in order to literally focus the audience and further define the scope of the rest of the album.  With that in mind, I liked Jeff Bridge's spoken introduction in the Grid.<br /><br />The track Rinzler appealed to the \\"rivet head\\" (industrial music fan) in me.  Though short, it is the perfect loud, fast paced, beat driven character theme and introduction.  In less than two minutes it starts off slow and uncertain, but quickly picks up pace to provide an aural definition to Rinzler's intensity and devotion.  Without even seeing the film, a listener knows that Rinzler is pivotal to the story.  This track continues with the next track, the Game Has Changed, in which the protagonist of the story / soundtrack (Sam) is pitted against the antagonist Rinzler.  With the conflict now established, the story and soundtrack can really begin.  If you liked these two tracks, I encourage you to listen to some of Bear McCreary's reimaged [[ASIN:B000UZ4C4A Battlestar Galactica: Season 3]] soundtracks.<br /><br />Finally, while programmers and fans of the original Tron film should be pleased by the track \\"End of Line\\" based on its namesake alone, the track itself also hails back to the style and tempo of the original film.  If you liked this track, you might enjoy music from electronic-industrial artists such as Monstrum Sepsis ([[ASIN:B000CAGL7O Movement]]) or Gridlock ([[ASIN:B000120ZUM Formless]]).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The samples do an excellent job of characterizing the tracks.  The soundtrack itself stands alone without having seen the movie (yet).  It tells a story (something any good album should do) using a variety of tempos and character based themes.  And finally, the digital download was quick and included the complete liner notes (which are naturally visually attractive).rd to begin a song or even throughout is common place.

B004132I20|5.0|Despite the ominous signs of a one-year old unbroadcast pilot and the subsequent three-part series being broadcast in the dog days of Summer where TV channels usually bury their misfires while everyone is still on holiday, Mark Gatiss and Steve Moffat's smart modern day reworking of Sherlock Holmes turns out to be a major treat thanks to clever writing, stylish direction and, most important, great casting. That Sherlock works so well is in no small part due to an engagingly sociopathic Holmes in the shape of a superb Benedict Cumberbatch and a better than usual Martin Freeman's no-nonsense Watson, recently demobbed from service in Afghanistan with a partially psychosomatic war wound. While it's never quite as extraordinarily good as the first episode (the second being the weakest), it puts Guy Ritchie's recent blockbuster to shame in the smarts stakes.     Finding clever visual ways to show Holmes' deductive process that occasionally threaten to veer into CSI Baker Street territory, it's remarkably effective at transplanting Holmes to the 20th Century with credibility and ingenuity intact - for example, the watch trick from The Sign of Four is brilliantly adapted to a mobile phone that reveals far too much about its owner for comfort, while, instead of a 7% solution, Sherlock's reliant on nicotine patches when bored - and it's savvy enough about Holmes' stamping ground to show just how the one-way system in central London makes it possible for two people on foot to overtake a taxi in one striking action setpiece. In many ways more stylised than Guy Ritchie's take, with intricately edited montages, superimposed captions and occasional but sparing use of split screens, it never loses sight of the character - this is very much Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes as you suspect he might have been written had Sir Arthur lived and worked today.     Moffat's parallel tenure on the revamped Doctor Who does seep through in attempts to make Holmes a more dangerous figure who may just capable of becoming the kind of psychopath he hunts and in the through-line Moriarty backstory, as well as a running gag with various characters assuming Watson is Sherlock's boyfriend. Unfortunately Mark Gatiss' Mycroft - Sherlock's smarter brother - is too arch and League of Gentlemen a figure to quite fit in: he's more late Avengers than Arthur Conan Doyle, and Vinette Robinson's adversarial policewoman seems to be channelling the worst aspects of Billie Piper in her surly latter NuWho episodes. But the worst is saved for the unveiling of Moriarty in the otherwise excellent final episode, The Great Game - it's not quite the descent into tedious camp attention-seeking that Russell Tedious Davies brought to the Master in Dr Who, but the actor's absurd vocal gymnastics undermine some good writing with an attention-seeking disregard for reality that characterised the worst of the Jeremy Brett episodes. Which is a shame, because Cumberbatch is one of the very best screen Holmes ever, able to do so very much with (apparently) so little that it's like watching Einstein vs Graham Norton engaging in a battle of wits. It's something that dearly needs to be remedied for the much-anticipated second season, but it's still not enough to detract from the most enjoyable and believable new Holmes in years. Even at 90 minutes, three episodes is far too few, and a year for the next batch of three to be broadcast is already starting to feel like a very long wait.     Along with audio commentaries on the first and third episodes and a documentary on the making of the series, the main extra is the unbroadcast 55-minute pilot episode, and it's a good job it was never broadcast or it might have been dismissed as one of those nice ideas that didn't quite work. Despite sharing the same plot as the first episode, it's visibly underfunded compared to the finished version, but more than the lack of style or the rough technical edges it's never quite as sharp as it could be. Much of the backstory is missing - no Mycroft, no Moriarty lurking in the shadows, while Lestrade willingly calls Sherlock for help rather than being badgered into allowing him on the case - and the show has a somewhat more sedentary feeling with dialogue taking precedence over action and scenes often playing too long yet saying less. The scoring is much clumsier too. But it's also clear that there's gold in the pairing of Cumberbatch and Freeman and in the script even if it may need a bit more digging and polishing, and satisfyingly they've learned from their mistakes in the dry run: there's nothing that's been lost or changed that shouldn't have been, nothing left behind that should have been carried over. There's enough that's good in it to have made it worthwhile on its own terms, but thankfully for once good enough wasn't good enough and they came up with a future classic.     One curious side note: for some reason Hungarian gypsy music seems to have become the default mode for Holmes scores these days (though David Arnold recorded his themes long before Hans Zimmer started scoring the Guy Ritchie film). It works rather well here and doesn't have the Ennio Morricone/Maurice Jarre influences nor the odd Irish jig of it's bigger-budget rival, but it's a curious musical choice for one of the most British of detectives.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|It is fair to say the Brothers Gibb suffer from a glut of \\"greatest hits\\" packages.  And if you own Tales from the Brothers Gibb, you probably don't need this.  But if you don't - and you want something more than the hits - this is an excellent purchase.  Yes, there's niggling details - \\"Lamplight\\" is missing from Robin's disc and I would have liked to have heard more outtakes/demos on Barry's disc, and Islands in the Stream is clearly recut with unnecessary additional lyrics.  But you can't argue with the quality of the base material.  And Andy's disc is particularly well-chosen, with half of Flowing Rivers present.  It's a wonderful lilt through the Bee Gees catalog, a terrifically enjoyable listen.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|One of those really bad ideas that surprisingly turned out rather well, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes doesn't entirely work but offers enough fun along the way for that not to matter that much. Feeling at times like one of producer Joe Silver's projects for his Dark Castle horror label before the budget escalated, it pits a two-fisted Holmes against a supernatural adversary who has risen from the grave (not the first project to have the idea: Holmes was due to take on Dracula in a rival project at Columbia, and it's perhaps not accidental that Mark Strong's Satanic villain is played as a cross between Dracula and Himmler). The emphasis is on action and comedy rather than sleuthing and intellect, but when a film includes a spectacular setpiece where a giant henchman destroys a shipyard and knocks down a ship (not a boat, a full-sized ship!) in an attempt to crush the world's greatest consulting detective it's hard to complain that you're not getting your money's worth. It's certainly no surprise that while the slew of Homes films over the past century have usually been reliable but modestly financially successful earners, this is the first to do real blockbuster business: it's a crowd-please and no mistake.     While it's good to see the trend of giving Watson his due as a man of action and intelligence continuing here, Holmes doesn't come over quite so well despite Robert Downey Jr's best efforts, the script generally limiting his deductive reasoning to evaluating the most effective way to beat an opponent (not entirely out of keeping with Doyle's stories) with too many of his other conclusions rather too elementary to convince us of his genius. Even a scene where he improvises one of his disguises from items he finds on the street doesn't work as well on screen as it probably did on paper. Instead the emphasis seems more on a Withnail and Watson approach to the mismatched flatmates that offers some amusement but never really takes hold as well as the BBC's engagingly ingenious modern-day updating in Sherlock. Nor does Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler really work here, never given a real chance to demonstrate the genius that made her the only adversary to beat Holmes in favor of a bit on Unresolved Sexual Tension bickering rivalry.     The real star of the film is the city of London itself in the age of Empire, which assumes centre stage as setpieces are set around shipyards, a half-built Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and London's Docklands when they still were docks, and very vividly realised it is too on a scale previously undreamt of. The CGI may not always be 100% convincing and its flaws are magnified on the small screen, but if it had been attempted in an earlier age it would have required model shots and matte paintings that would have required a similar suspension of disbelief. Best of all is the was the film manages to weave the director's love of London lore into the fabric of the action, setting in the most vividly realised depiction of the disparity between the Empire's corridors of power and it's barely working class underbelly since Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade.     A great Holmes film? Certainly not. But for the couple of hours it's on it's far more entertaining one than we probably had any right to expect.
1439102937|4.0|I really love Sex & the City which is why I purchased this book. I loved the characters and the storyline. However, I didn't care for some of the language. I don't want to sound like a prude or anything but the constant uses of gd and so on I felt took away from the story. Other than that I think it was a cute story!
0143118420|1.0|I bought this book at a used book sale to benefit our local hospital.  I am SO glad I did not pay more than $2 for it.  I really wanted to like this book, but I found myself struggling to finish it.  I have read at least 3 other books since having begun Eat, Pray, Love.  While the author is a good writer, the story painfully drug on.  At first, I encouraged myself to keep reading because perhaps I hadn't given it enough time to \\"take off.\\"  When I realized it wasn't going to get any better, I foreced myself to keep reading just for the sake of finishing.  I am in full agreement that this woman used her divorce to catapult her career -- her book idea molded her trip (with the oh-so-convenient advance) and not the other way around.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I still have the original cassette of [[ASIN:B000002GHQ Christmas Portrait]] from 1978. Since then this has been my favorite Christmas album, although I'm glad it came out on CD. The only thing better than the original, is that the Christmas Collection has a second disc of this great music. I try listening to new and different Christmas music each year, but I have to agree with others, \\"Without any hesitation that this is the best Christmas recording I have ever heard!\\" I love the medleys, the arrangements, the instrumentals with the vocal mixes. For me it's about as traditional as we can get when it comes to Christmas. As each year we grow nostalgic for Christmas as it nears, I too grow nostalgic for the music on this album each year.<br /><br />Around Thanksgiving, I found myself without this album. It was packed away and it would have taken me at least a week to get it. I preferred to just order another copy. It will not go to waste as long as I am alive!

B0047WJ12K|1.0|If you liked Jaws, 24, Godfather I, The Transporter, Deathtrap, Casablanca, and It's a Wonderful Life, we have something in common. And since I hated Inception, you might, also. Why? Because what we liked so much about these other stories is that the writer enabled the audience to \\"move the story ahead\\" with each scene, even with flashbacks. For me, viewing Inception was like a game: you the viewer will see nearly all of the scenes in random order and will have to put the puzzle together to make a story out of it. If you are willing to watch Inception several times before you conclude, \\"Aha, now I know the story,\\" I think you'll be among many who appreciate it. Otherwise, perhaps you'll be like I . . . wishing you had been warned.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|Overall, I would say that this was one of the better movie soundtracks that I've ever heard. Did I like every song on it? No. But the song by Garrett Hedlund on it, Chances Are, was worth the cost of the album alone. If he ever decides to give up acting and pursue a country singing career, I'll be one of the first in line to buy his material. His singing is that good. He has a very nice sultry, smoky tone to his voice and I could just sit and listen to him sing all day long. On the other hand, I could only listen to the title track, Country Strong, about six times before I grew somewhat tired of it. Someone said that it reminded them of a more mature The Climb, well, I think I like the less mature one better. Vince Gill is a nice addition though. I think for me it is the fact that the lyrics just don't ring true for the one do the singing. That was kinda how I felt about all of the GP songs (especially Shake That Thing-personally, did not like it) with the exception though of Me and Tennessee, a duet with Tim McGraw. That is one of the best songs on this soundtrack. I only wish that Tim had more than just one song on here. As for Gwyneth's vocal abilities, I do think that she has a nice voice but even still, I actually found myself enjoying the other solo female tracks on this album more, such as Leighton's song, Words I Couldn't Say, which was very easy to listen to and just plain enjoyable. Love Don't Let Me Down by Patty Loveless and Chris Young was really good as well and A Little Bit Stronger by Sara Evans was a top track in my opinion. Faith Hill's song, Give In To Me, was a personal favorite but Faith has always been a personal favorite artist of mine. Now there's someone who deserves a standing ovation along with Patty. I'm just patiently waiting on her to cut her next album. Overall though, definitely worth the money!
192076920X|5.0|With a touch of sadness, I have concluded the epic, brilliantly written, poetic masterpiece of literature that is called 'Shantaram'. This book, all 933 pages have been one of the most amazing journey's I have been on both in the form of a novel & story and a personal journey of the soul.    There are some books that affect you in ways you never could have imagined until you open them and let the worlds escape and flow into your heart. Shantaram is one of these books.    Gregory David Robert's is an amazing man in his own right. His real life story of escape from jail to finding himself in India in some of the most far removed situations is staggering. All throughout this time in exile he wrote and kept writing, about his experiences and his thoughts on life & love. This is how he came from being 'Australias most wanted man' to writing 'Australias most wanted novel'.    From his monumental descriptions of his beloved Bombay, to his craving of fatherly love, his crippling addiction to heroin to his love for a woman who would never love him back, this book explores some of the deepest thoughts and feelings that many of us at some time in our lives have either experienced or thought about in a similar context.   This book is almost like a self guided journey into our own soul. Every moment, every page, every word kept me captivated for all 933 pages of the book. Each page as the story unfolded of 'Lin's' life & times in the slum to working in Bombay's notorious mafia or being caught up in a war with his loved friends in the hills of Afghanistan, held you in the moment as almost you could feel the cold snow falling on your face as you were huddled up there on that mountain fighting a war that wasn't yours or to feel the warmth of a lovers embrace on a hot Bombay evening or perhaps the cold calculated void stare of an enemy that had a undeniable dislike of your presence. Gregory has the unique ability to describe such feelings, emotions and situations with such a high level of detail and accuracy without being vain or over descriptive that it is truly something to behold. And this is the books success in my view. The perfect balance.    As a piece of literature, this book is one of the most enjoyable and memorable that I think I will have ever the chance of setting my eyes on, that is until possibly the sequel is published but until then, I do not think for myself after all the books, the many from varying tales of love & despair, adventure & fantasy, could stir my heart more that what 'Shantaram' has. It has taught me who and what is important in life & how trust is one of the most holy and largely exploited human traits we have. It has taught me that love comes in all forms & disguises.     So here it is. To 'Shantaram'. Its been a pleasure reading you like the many who discover you. You are a enigma that no words can explain. My life has changed from reading and discovering some hidden jems, pearls of wisdom if you like that sprung forth from your pages as if waiting in ambush until I arrived. For this I am truly grateful and therefore you will always have that special place on my bookshelf wherever this world takes me.    Thank you

But after having seen it, I am still blown away by just how fantastic this movie was!!  It was funny, heartwarming and a beautiful love story.  The music was incredible and the laughs just kept on coming! At no point was I bored and the scene out on the lake at night was simply breathtaking!  I'm surprised that I am saying this, but I cannot wait to see Tangled again!    Marvelous job!!  You guys knocked it out of the park!
030746363X|5.0|Few books bring an overwhelming feeling of excitement just a couple pages in - the 4 Hour Body is one of these few.  I felt an urgency to read this book once I saw what it had to offer.  Tim Ferriss goes balls to the wall to change your life in this huge bible of rapid body transformation.  Highly recommend purchasing this book if you've struggled with weight loss, strength gain, or mental/physical health in general.  Tim tells you what your doctor can't, and it's amazing.  My personal favorites are the use of the minimum effective dose to maximize efficiency, oversimplifaction to get the ball rolling, and dietary methods to produce incredible results like tripling testosterone.    If you give this book a chance, it will change your life for the better.

The made Rizzo look like an emotional sap, since the song that Belle sings makes him cry you only have a basic jist of why he is crying.     An amazing movie though

Are you reviewing the album or the artist?<br /><br />Let me tell you, if you are a \\"true\\" music fan , you can separate the artist from his or her music.<br />With that said, let's move on to the review. I will say it isn't a masterpiece, but it is a solid album<br /><br />S&M- fun, catchy tune that is a little disturbing to me,but that's ok.<br />I ain't into all of that.<br /><br />Cheers(Drink to that) 5 freaking stars. Make no bones about it, this is one of the standout tracks. Let's<br />hit the bar, Ri-Ri!<br /><br />Skin-One word, OMG! 5 stars<br /><br />What's My Name- I will downgrade this to 3 1/2 stars, due to Drake. No matter how many guest spots he do, I will not like<br />him as an artist or his music. She could have stood on her own on this track.<br /><br />Raining Men- This one is a little too \\"Beyonce\\" for my taste. She has her own sound. Trust me, she doesn't have to<br />borrow from that snore to represent. Even Nikki couldn't save this one for me.<br /><br />Man Down- Complete insanity- 5 stars. No words are needed. The music, again, speaks for itself.<br /><br />Honorable mentions, California King Bed, Fading, Love The Way You Lie, Only Girl. They are not terribly horrible as<br />some of reviewers are claiming that they are.<br /><br />May I offer a suggestion, buy albums from the artists you like! Leave the reviews to those who know how to separate<br />the artist from their music.<br /><br />That is all.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|I really like the aging Diane Keaton ever so much more than I did the Annie Hall-ish, squirley younger Keaton with her annoying mannerisms. She is at her best in this laugh out loud (and sob out loud, as well) film. In fact, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is also a superb vehicle for the talent of Jack Nicholson. Were Keaton and Nicholson ever a real-life couple? I ask because there is such chemistry at work between the two!<br /><br />Real life--yes, that area where older men--wrinkled, weightier, and richer, date young women who still have dew on their skins. As Amanda Peet's character reminds him: \\"You don't date women over 30.\\" The older (and larger) he is, the sillier he looks with these women. And intimacy? Do those young women really--well, you know.<br /><br />Am I saying that older men are repugnant? No, of course not, but the movie itself makes my point. Where is the comfort level for a couple in a relationship? Where is a real sharing of life? With the couple of similar ages, similar life styles, similar experiences, or the relationship in which one is trying to stay young and the other is seeking what?--riches, a good time, what?<br /><br />Jack's character Harry has never been in love and finds himself in a dither concerning what it might mean for his life. Give up those under-30's? For a woman his age? The initial idea of kissing Erica's (Keaton) less dewy mouth makes his face screw all up. Enter Keanu Reeves, a doctor who treats Jack's heart attack and becomes part of the triangle. The doctor has long admired Erica's talent as a very successful playwright, thoroughly familiar with her work. He is smitten.<br /><br />Reversing the older man/younger woman scenario to older woman/younger man is quite interesting. Keaton plays it for all it's worth. Reeve is an excellent casting choice here in making this combination work. (But Demi and Ashton have already shown us that.)<br /><br />When Harry meets Erica at her house on the shore (outside New York), he is there with her daughter, one of those dewy younger women, for their first-time experience. A heart attack stops the action, setting up a scenario for him to get to know a woman his age. Their sex scene (which reveals very little) is one of the two funniest sex scenes I've ever seen. (The other was Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson trying to imitate early television scenes in which one foot is always on the floor.) The scene is also poignant.<br /><br />When Harry returns to the city, Keaton believes they actually have something. When she sees him out with one of the dew creatures, she is heart-broken. I sobbed with her for the next few scenes (and every time I watch the movie again). Enter the doctor to mend her broken heart.<br /><br />Paris is the scene of reconciliation. Ah, Paris, that city of romance. The one false note of the film is Keanu's reaction to Harry and Erica.<br /><br />\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is an excellent film which addresses issues of an aging population seeking love.

0618918248|3.0|This was a very difficult book for me to read.  The hardback edition is only a mere 374 pages, but I quickly found that almost every other page was forcing me to challenge my beliefs by questioning them on both scientific and logical levels.   I consider myself open-minded and approached this book likewise. True, there are parts that I still strongly disagree with, but more surprising to me were the many parts where I was in enthusiastic agreement with Dawkins.    AGREEMENTS    I agree with his arguments that Catholicism is just cleverly disguised polytheism, as detailed on pages 34 and 35. Likewise, as I learned in a mythology class in college, the Catholic devotion to the Virgin Mary is just cleverly disguised mother-goddess worship.    I agree with his arguments against those ridiculous televangelists on page 32.    I agree with that there is a lot of waste in religion as shown on page 164. Certainly natural resources used on towering cathedrals could be better used elsewhere.    I agree that there are lots of Christians that certainly don't act like it, as shown in the letters on pages 211 to 214. To quote Gandhi, \\"I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.\\"    Because it happened to me, I strongly agree with his view that children should not become indoctrinated. They should be free to explore religion--or not--at their own discretion. This is covered in multiple parts of the book, but especially Chapter 9.    DISAGREEMENTS    As I've said earlier, there are several things I disagree with, but to me, the only one worth any comment is his view of God.    Simply put, the God that Dawkins is ranting against is not the same one most religious people believe in. This is because Dawkins insists that God must have had a creator.  He totally misses the point.   If God had to be created, then He's not much of a God, is He?  I certainly wouldn't waste my time worshiping a created God.    With this being the case, his strong anti-God arguments are like firing a machine gun at a tin can.   Whatever book Dawkins writes next, I hope he realizes that to argue against religion effectively, he has to use the definitions that the practitioners themselves use, not his own version.    FINAL OBSERVATIONS    Reading this book, I got the impression that Dawkins wasn't so much frustrated with religion itself, but the EXPLOITATION of religion--again, something that I myself can agree with.     I was a bit disappointed with his use of Gallup polls and statistics to further his points. Statistical evidence is about as authoritative as citing Wikipedia on your 10-page essay on Immanuel Kant in AP English.  Statistical evidence only holds weight if 1) You poll EVERYBODY that the topic pertains to, 2) Everybody answers truthfully and 3) one must realize that that poll is only a \\"snapshot\\" of that particular moment. So a poll from 1976 is probably not going to hold much weight in 2010.  As a further example, one could argue that the Amazon \\"star-rating\\" system is a \\"poll\\" of the \\"quality\\" of a product. But even this is misleading, as there are constantly annoying reviewers who write 1 and  5 star \\"reviews\\" based on emotion, not experience.  I don't know about you, but there have been times I've bought \\"1-star\\" products and absolutely loved them and there have been times that I've bought \\"5-star\\" products and wondered what all the hype was about.    OVERALL    In the end, I both agree and disagree with Dawkins. But more importantly, I appreciate his effort at challenging people of different religious backgrounds to question their beliefs and not be mindless lemmings.

Composition and story telling are tough subjects to explain and most books don't explore the subject fully. This book gives many visual examples. All examples are presented in greyscale for a reason, and that's to focus the instruction on simple shapes. My advice for advanced illustrators is to get this book now before it goes out of print...because any art book that appeals to such a select audience rarely gets printed more than once.

B000I0QL82|4.0|Every year as a personal tradition I watch about 20 movies I associate with the Christmas season.  This is one of my favorites.  Made in 1942, it was one from my parents' generation and familiar to me from TV reruns when I was a child, so it is very nostalgic for a time period and a season.  Holiday Inn is sort of the older version of White Christmas; it even features the holiday song.  It was made for a generation saying a spirited goodbye to the \\"old world\\" as it prepared to face a war that would change life forever.  Many of those who enjoyed the film in the theaters when it came out would never live to see its remake a decade later.<br /><br />The black and white film is a classic of the genre. While White Christmas depends heavily on color, contrast and saturation in its filmation, Holiday Inn creates its effects of elegance and emotion through great attention to texture, design and camera angle, creating a film that is even more sensually lush than the brightly colored later film.<br /><br />The musical features a reworking of some old songs, familiar to those alive at the time, and the introduction of new ones that have since become holiday favorites.  The comedy team features song man Crosby as it did later in White Christmas, but here his sneaky side-kick is the brilliant dance man, Fred Astaire.  As in the later movie, Crosby is about to lose the girl but manages to pull the coal out of the fire at the end by being the \\"nice guy.\\"  The film is filled with songs that feature his very recognizable voice.  Almost everyone still recognizes his White Christmas when it is played during the holidays even today, and it is often featured as virtually iconic of the season in modern films.  Some of the dance routines by Astaire are considered classics now, like the \\"firecracker\\" tap dance and the very famous \\"drunk\\" dance.  While they probably seem tame by comparison to the more athletic and acrobatic choreography of the present, for the time they definitely pushed the creative envelope.  Anyone who appreciates \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" will definitely enjoy some of the dances that were at the root of the \\"classic\\" ballroom styles.<br /><br />The film again features the concept of an inn as a venue for the action, though it is now Crosby who is the owner, rather than the retired general as in White Christmas.  World War II, for the United States at least, had just begun, and there is a musical number regarding \\"Freedom\\" that emphasizes the military aspect of protecting it for the US and for others.  In this vein, the film White Christmas is a logical remake of Holiday Inn for a post-war audience.<br /><br />Christmas is not the main focus of the story, as it is in the other film, but the holidays in general and Christmas especially are brilliantly represented in set and song.  The patronizing racial attitudes of the period and certainly the \\"blackface\\" musical vignette will probably set a modern person's teeth on edge during the Lincoln's Birthday routine, but for the time it was probably considered very \\"tolerant.\\"  It is certainly a positive measuring stick of our social progress over the past 70 years. My favorite of the routines is the rather slap stick minuet for Washington's Birthday.velope.

The movie actually had a plot that was quite interesting for me.  Each character carried their personalities well.      I've seen the A-Team TV series many times, but was too young to be able to compare it to this movie.  You don't need to know much about the TV show series to enjoy a 'fun' movie.  Plan to watch it.

B003L77GRO|3.0|After avidly watching seasons 1-4, I was thrilled to see season 5: so thrilled I watched it all within 2 days. Season 4 provided the most provocative and twisted villain yet, and with a heart dropping twist at the end, it was difficult to see how season 5 wasn't going to be completely captivating: Then we met Julia Styles (Lumen). Initially, I couldn't distinguish her face in the first few episodes, so I wasn't even sure it was Julia Styles, but then it became painfully clear she would be a major character. Her acting was horrible, and her lines were spoken with pop culture delivery and the depth of a kiddie pool. She was so disconnected from the scenes and other characters that it seemed like her parts were filmed at entirely different times, and then inserted when the story required cliches and stating obvious. Then there were the elementary and unnecessary dramatic pauses, and terrible, overly emotional crying that broke up the energy of the story. Brutal. I found myself wanting her to be Dexter's next victim, not empathizing with her traumatizing rape story.    The most disappointing part was how quickly intimate Lumen became with Dexter. After 4 seasons of suspense, withholding his secrets, and almost being discovered multiple times, Dexter spills everything and shares all his \\"dark passenger\\" with Lumen within a few episodes. What made Dexter so unique from other TV series was the main character's struggle with detachment and lack of emotion. That all gets muddled in season 5, with the bizarre intimacy and terrible acting of Julia Styles. It took Rita 3 seasons to get it right with Dexter, and Lumen takes barely 3 episodes!    Ultimately, the story line of season 5 is intriguing and interesting, but Julia Styles was completely the wrong choice for Lumen. This season contributes very little to the overall series, and I won't spend the money or miss owning it as part of my collection. Since it is Dexter, I can't help giving it atleast 3 stars (every other seasonsurely gets 5 stars), but the truth is I really did hate the season, and wish they would have done more with it. Personally, I think season 5 did far more to develop Deb's character than Dexter's. If you are a Dexter fan, I suppose you need to see this season to know what is going on. But if you have heard about Dexter and are looking for a season to watch, SEASON 5 IS NOT THE ONE TO BUY.
B0042816YK|1.0|[NOTE: I drastically edited my review. The essence is above the line. The addition is below. I hope this new/edited review at least helps people stop and think.]    You've probably read the raves about the scenery and food. Yes, they're great. And probably seen that Julia did what she could with this role. Again that's true. Also that she plays a main character who leaves her life behind to find herself. At least, that's what the movie is supposed to be.    But all I saw was that Liz had a great life, but thinks that friends, family, and relationships are disposable. Financial security is something to be discarded on a whim. Just go ahead and throw everything away, then focus on yourself, yourself, yourself.    Everyone else in this movie had it harder than Liz did. Her husband was willing to talk things over with her, but she refused. Then she dove straight into the arms of another man, dumping him too when she didn't feel fulfilled enough. All around the world, Liz found people whose lives were more difficult than hers. Did it give her pause to think?    Nope. All Liz learned is that she needs to be nicer to herself, to find people who make her happy, and that she can love others and herself at the same time. *gasp*    After finding this revelation, does Liz make any effort to repair the trail of shattered relationships she left behind? Does she realize that all relationships take work, maintenance, and tender loving care?    Nope. Instead, Liz just rides off into the sunset, finally knowing who she is and what she wants. Keep looking for your identity until you discover who you are. Then live happily ever after, as if relationships either work or they don't, like some kind of childhood fairy tale.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  But wait! This is supposed to be an inspirational movie! A movie that shows a brave woman's journey as she travels around the world determined to find herself. Ok, great, I get that.    Now picture a MAN in this role. A MAN who divorces his rich wife and leaves all his friends because he isn't satisfied and doesn't know who he is anymore. A MAN who goes from woman to woman, feeling unloved by any of them.    A MAN traveling around the world, eating until he bursts out of his clothes. A MAN learning to be nicer to himself. A MAN caring only about himself, until he realizes he can love others and himself, and then finally lets himself fall in love again.    Is this STILL a beautiful movie?

The gorgeous boy who Anna is instantly attracted to, and she's not alone. But St. Clair has a girlfriend who graduated the year before but is still in France. So he is off limits but the two quickly become best friends. I love that they develop a relationship as friends before anything else. It really helped build up the story and wasn't the cliche love at first site can't leave each other alone.     Throughout this book both St. Clair and Anna deal with their respective relationships with the other people in their lives and try to figure out who they really want to be with. When tragedy falls this group of friends it bring St. Clair and Anna even closer. But at the same time their intense feelings could drive each other away if left unsaid. This book as amazing, and I loved the interactions throughout the group. How Anna comes out of her shell and starts to enjoy France and it's with the help of her new friends that she does this.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Completely removed from Hollywood's adolescent fluff, Danny Boyle's latest feature \\"127 Hours\\" is an almost documentary retelling of the 2003 news story about a young hiker Aron Ralston who, his right arm pinned by a boulder in a rock fissure, had to resort to extreme measures in order to extricate himself. Ralston himself wrote a book about the ordeal called \\"Between A Rock and a Hard Place\\", which has won sympathy for his predicament, even though I understand he broke the cardinal rule of hiking alone: always -- I mean always -- let someone know where you're going to be. As I said, the style is pretty straight forward, though Boyle does indulge in montages to create certain effects -- the hallucinations brought on by dehydration, for instance. The movie's first carefree fifteen minutes establish the hero's absolute joie de vivre so that the audience understands when Ralston (portrayed by James Franco) is ready to do anything to protect his endangered life, miles from civilization, and completely incommunicado. (What a time for a hip young man to be without his cell phone!) Finally, faced with starvation, possessing what is basically no more than a box cutter and no other choice, he knows there is something he must do. One is reminded of the hunter finding a severed fox's paw in a trap, realizing the animal has chewed off its own paw in order to escape and live. Boyle's off-center, indeed edgy style is perfect for this type of story, and \\"127 Hours\\" is one of his best movies, right up there with \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Shallow Grave\\". (His futuristic essays tend to be somewhat  derivative, and I have to admit I was disappointed in the belief-bending \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".) The solution to Ralston's problem is, yes, a little difficult to watch, especially when he reaches his ulna and radius and (not having a surgical saw) must resort to a crude procedure before he can continue. But Boyle handles the difficult sequence with a great amount of restraint and suggestion. Adaring director but not sensationalistic, Boyle proves once again in this story of survival and almost incredible courage that he can deal with unpleasant subjects in a polished and engrossing manner.

0307588343|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading A Colossal Failure of Common Sense by Lawrence McDonald.  His book provides a very readable, sometimes humorous, instructive account of the collapse of the market and organizational dynamics at Lehman which many will relate to from their own experiences.      In some respects it is five stories intertwined.  You learn how difficult it is, and how  hard-working and creative you have to be, to earn a spot with a major investment bank if you are not groomed for the street via the right schools and universities or through other connections.    You appreciate the fortitude of some of these traders to stand by their analysis either at the casino gaming tables or on the trading desk when the rapidly deteriorating position on a massive bet would make most men fold.  You realize how smart some of these people are and develop some appreciation for the hard work and thorough analysis undertaken to truly understand a position or market.  If you have never seen it before, you see how a handful of misguided characters can \\"pour on the coal\\" and turn a steadily performing company into a run-away freight train.  Finally one sees how difficult it can be to slow down the freight train once the few professionals, long sounding the alarm bell, manage to convince and activate a critical mass of their contemporaries to the looming disaster.

B003L20ICE|3.0|I'm amazed this film generated such great reviews from critics.  I found myself unimpressed with Nick and Jules, and thought Ruffalo charmed and stole the film.    I don't know any gay couples who live such a barren life, and have two very long standing close friendships with both a male gay couple and a female gay couple, who lead a full, happy, and intimate life with one another and are always great to be around, even in their worst moments; they're real, confessed, and human in the best sense of the word.    When you get down to it, Love is simply Love.  And that's exactly what was missing in this film.  Rather than show sexuality between Nick and Jules, and Jules and Ruffalo with any emotional vulnerability, sensitivity, or tenderness, it was reduced  to the barest impulse of physical sex and nothing else. As for the scene in the bedroom between Nick and Jules, you've got to be kidding. Nick could have been reading a book!  That's it? Patty Page once sang a song \\"Is That All There Is?      As for Jules rabid sexual hunger for Ruffalo, this was never really addressed in the film.      If anyone exhibited any capacity for loving, it was Ruffalo, and in the end, the movie explained him away as an \\"interloper\\", rather than the one and only person with the capacity to love and enter into relationship with the others.    If you want to see a \\"real\\" film about gay people, rent \\"A Single Man\\" starring Colin Firth, directed by Tom Ford.

I always feel better and have an increased positive outlook after listening to her in my car on the way to and from work. She has a great voice for narration. I give her books and accompanying audio books to all my friends and family, especially when they need a boost of positive energy!
B0044XV3R8|4.0|This is a must own. I don't know why they just didn't leave the movie alone and put in all these extra scenes anyway. If you loved Avatar, you MUST own this one.
B003VIW8DU|5.0|It always saddens me to read reviews by people who have never had a band, sung, played, written music, recorded  it or arranged it.  Sometimes I think these folks are English majors or something.  Or else they only listen to music on hideously compressed downloads.    I have the actual CD, not the expanded version.  I feel it is a masterpiece--and it is a fully coherent piece of music. Yes, there are places where Ferry's voice sounds swathed with cabaret smoke, but thematically, it's what you'd want.  Ferry makes the covers his own, which Johnny Cash once said was his personal benchmark when recording somebody else's song.    The layering of guitars and synths rewards many good, very loud listenings.  And the lyrics are not trite.  Ferry has always played back and forth by taking cliches and turning them upside down in the next line.  And the line \\"I'd Can Can if I could\\" alone is worth the price of admission.    Highly recommended by this musician.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|The martial arts in this movie are good, but let's just say this: no one is that good. I have trained for over 10 years and have even trained with some of the guys who did the MA work on this film and trained Angelina to fight. Let's just say this: no one could ever be that good. A Russian spy takes out 4 U.S. CIA or FBI guys who have handguns ?! Puuuhlease.     Other than that, this movie is really exciting and good, good fun. One of the better movies since \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (which, incidently \\"suffered\\" from the same issue).     Btw, if the Soviets had been that good, we all would be speaking Russian now.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|I agree with most others that the final season was ultimately unsatisfying. However, most are, and that's the plain truth. X-Files anyone? I give this season three stars because, while I didn't particularly like what was happening all the time, the characters are still fantastic.    There were just too many questions still left unanswered, and I would have rather hung on for another year to try and figure out a better way to close it. Still, it's a great series, and at least it had an end, unlike, \\"Surface\\" and \\"Invasion,\\" to name a few.
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|This woman is gifted to the hilt.  Her voice is like Nina Simone meets Norah Jones, with a little Peggy Lee thrown in for a good one.  She's got the soul, the heat, the keyboards, a quiver to her voice, the french singing, a love for the standards and the phrasing to deliver them, and the soaring smooth pipes.  And her own sexiness on top of all that.  Buy the deluxe edition for the live Paris disc, pour a cognac, sit back and hold your baby close.
0307269752|5.0|Our book group chose to read Stieg Larsson's popular novel, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  Several other of the many Amazon reviewers of this title appear to have come to the book in the same way.  I had grown bored with the DVD based on the novel and thus had little expectation for the book.  Our book group usually does not choose thrillers.  But I was surprised because the novel is indeed a page-turner.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />There are at least three interrelated stories in this yarn of a book which is primarily set in Sweden early in the 21st Century. The two major characters are Michael Blomkvist, a liberal financial journalist who aims to expose corruption in large companies and Lisabeth Salander, the title character, a gifted but troubled young woman of 24 who is under the guardianship of the state but who is a whiz with computers and at investigation. As it progresses, much of the book involves the unlikely professional and personal relationships that develop between Blomkwist and Salander.<br /><br />As the book opens, Blomkvist has just been sentenced to a short prison term for libeling a major industrial tycoon named Wennerstrom. (Libel laws obviously are much more stringent in Sweden than in the United States where this scenario whould have been most unlikely.)  At the trial, for reasons that stay obscure for much of the book, Blomkvist declines to defend the accusations he had leveled against Wennestrom and loses his case and his reputation.  He and Salander investigate the case further as the book proceeds.<br /><br />The other mystery plot is much more interesting and well- developed.  When he loses his libel case, Blomkvist is summoned to a remote island in northern Sweden by an aging industrialist named Vanger. Vanger offers to pay Blomkvist a substantial sum to investigate the disappearance of his young niece Harriet in 1965, nearly 40 years earlier.  At that time, Harriet was a girl of 16.  She disappeared mysteriously after a festival, when the attention of the island residents was diverted by an automobile crash on a bridge leading to the mainland. Vanger has spent much of his life, since Harriet's disappearance investigating how she died and who killed her.  He has had no success. Blomkvist reluctantly becomes involved.  As the story progresses, Salander comes to assist him in this investigation and in the separate investigation of Wennerstrom.<br /><br />The story of Vanger is complex, chilling, and tawdry.  It basically involves the entire Vanger family, many of whose members live on the island and dislike each other intensely. The investigation of Harriet and her fate take up most of the book.<br /><br />The story is for the most part well-paced and carefully constructed.  There is a large group of characters, including Blomkvist's married lady friend, the various Vangers, the Vanger's lawyer, and especially Salander.<br />As the book develops, the scene shifts from one character and place to another.  Tension builds throughout, and the story can be readily followed with its twists and turns without getting confused.  There are some chillingly evil scenes in this book.<br /><br />The pace of the book flags towards the end. The Vanger-Harriet part of the story resolves substantially before the book concludes, and the focus of the story returns to Wennerstrom and his claimed financial manipulations and corruptions. This portion of the story is much less interesting than the companion story, and it drags on too long. It seemed to me anticlimactic.  The Wennerstrom story and the Vagner-Harriet story both form the occasion for a good deal of preaching on the subjects of sexual exploitation and abuse and large capitalistic corruption and irresponsibility. Ordinarily, I am wary of books with these kinds of ideological preoccupations.  But in this case the themes were integrated convincingly into the story the author had to tell.  Thus, these themes did not interfere with my enjoyment of the book.  I did not find the novel ideologically driven.<br /><br />This was a long, riveting book, which I took up half-heartedly but found I could not put down. I am not sure that the remainder of the trilogy is for me, but I found this book fascination and well-worth the attention both that I gave it and that the book has received.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanen.

B000WTNCYA|5.0|This young woman can sing, wow.  Her voice soars.  What a great first album.  Her story is so compelling, how she came back from a tragic accident.  Check out the video of her in an interview with Jay-Z.  He looks almost dumbfounded as Melody explains how scatting is not far off from hip-hop.  Wait, that's the other way around.  She's great.      The disc is a little is a little short in length but then it's not full price either.  If there's anything I'd change it would be to give it a good audio treatment; it has a bit of that CD grain but she fixed that on her 2nd try out, My One And Only Thrill, which is great sounding disc.
0321687299|5.0|This book is a quick read to get you up to speed on the landscape of HTML5 and friends. I read it over the course of a week in my free time and it's helped immensely identify the usable parts of the new html specification. It is able to quickly and hilariously guide you through some gotchas and browser quirks while not getting too boring or becoming a regurgitation of the spec. I highly recommend it if you have to use, or want to use any of the html5 technologies within. Any longer of a review, and you might as well read the book.
B0013FBS20|4.0|This is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time. Unfortunately, the plot is quite predictable, and suspense is used way too much. It freaked both me and my mom out. A lot of editing must have been done, because there are huge gaps in the story's past, which leads to some confusion. All in all, I'd give it a four, but this isn't just science fiction, it's horror as well.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I did enjoy the book overall, but found the narration by the five-year-old to become a bit tedious after a while. The first part of the book drags on a little too long, but it gets very exciting and kept me wedded to my Kindle. I am glad it was a short read, however, because I don't think it would have held my interest much longer as it slowly coasted to the end. Not the worst read, not the best.
0307473473|4.0|Like so many novels in this genre, I found this to be an entertaining read, but ultimately forgettable. What can I say about a book so many others have reviewed? Not much. Will anyone read this? I doubt it.<br /><br />Pros: Dense, intelligent and satisfying mystery with interesting characters and intriguing moral and ethical dilemmas.<br /><br />Cons: Starts slow and the action does not kick into full gear until around page 400, the similar names were confusing (when a family tree is included you know you're in trouble), and it could have used a good editor.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this, and amazon had the best price by far.  I now own the entire series, and season 6 answers many questions.  I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but I am working my way through.  What fun it is!! Thanks, amazon.

0385751893|4.0|This was an interesting story about two boys growing up in Europe during World War 2.  It is a short book that will interest both adults and young readers.  I found the decision to go with a naive 9 year old boy as the main voice of the piece resulted in some interesting misunderstandings about what was actually happening in the story.  The plot doesn't seem to be going anywhere until the last 30 pages or so, but it has a good ending that will leave you to think about what happened.    The paperback has some weird translations issues.  Thankfully the difference is between British and American English, so it shouldn't be confusing to too many people (though I can imagine some young readers would be confused to read about tyres and pyjamas, especially when it is usually spelled pajamas for most of the book).    Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5, but since we can't do half stars, I'm rounding up to 4.
B00417HV14|5.0|Well directed, beautifully shot, and superbly edited, this DVD is a world class performance featuring extremely high production values.  The \\"you are there\\" camera angles definitely impart the sensation of having the best seat in the house, and the live concert sound quality and final mix are absolutely first-rate.  If you're a JB fan, you'll be quite pleased with this Blu-ray DVD.  If you're not already a fan, you surely will be after you see and hear this tour de force performance by a rising young guitarist whose God-given talents as a player, singer, and composer just might eclipse those of the best blues guitarists ever to grace a stage.  It simply doesn't get much better than his performance of \\"Further on Up The Road\\" as he trades licks with legendary blues man Eric Clapton, in Clapton's house.  JB is the real deal, and this DVD perfectly showcases his phenomenal talents and those of his incredible backing musicians.  Add this DVD to your collection.  You won't be disappointed!
0440236304|4.0|Don Burgett takes the reader on an interesting odyssey of recruiting, training and deploying paratroopers in World War II in Currahee!  The \\"airborne experiment\\" was totally new and untried in the United States Army and everything had to be learned from scratch.  As a result, initial standards for volunteers were extremely high and the hard training reduced the number of men even further.  The first airborne regiments consisted of the absolute best-of-the-best when they finally deployed to Europe.  It was a standard of such high excellence that it was never to be achieved again in the Airborne.<br /><br />Burgett takes us through the demanding training and the evolving culture of this new breed of warriors.  Then he takes the reader to deployment in England and finally to the chaos of combat before dawn on D-Day.<br /><br />His prose is simple and straightforward and his descriptions of combat are riveting and revealing.  He was part of a group of highly trained kids, many still just teenagers, that were dropped all over Normandy, mostly in the wrong places, who were expected to complete their missions.  That they did in fact succeed was a tribute to the individuals who coalesced as small units and took action.  The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment lived up to its motto, Currahee (We stand alone, together).<br /><br />This book has some photos and decent maps and is a must read for those interested in D-Day, paratroopers or World War II in Europe.<br /><br />John E.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|When someone absconds with the Pyramid of Giza and replaces it with a giant inflatable replica, it heralds the dawn of new super-villainy. The culprit, Vector, becomes the talk of the super-villain circle. Except that Gru - once the baddest super-villain around and sporting an accent somewhere between \\"Bela Lugosi and Ricardo Montalban\\" (to quote Steve Carrel) - isn't ready to pass the torch. The upstaged Gru hatches a plan to steal the moon, a feat juuuust a bit more showy than stealing the Pyramid of Giza. But here comes the wrench in the works. Apparently, even the most vile of villains hides a softer side. Only sometimes it takes the most drastic of measures to bring out the nice. Like, maybe, little girls knocking on the door selling cookies.<br /><br />Gru is one of those evil cats you find yourself instantly liking. Gru so relishes being a Big Bad, from his over-the-top heists to his petty acts against his suburban neighbors (yes, Gru dwells in the 'burbs) and the kids he passes on the street. It also helps that flashback sequences fill us in on how his icy mother time and again put him down, dashed his dreams. Gru bosses around an army of easily distracted cloned henchmen, but he seems to know each one of them by name, so that's another redeeming quality. Part of Gru's moon-theft scheme involves his adopting three little orphan girls. His deplorable parenting skills dictate that he sets out a doggy food bowl on the floor for the girls and a newspaper for them to do their business. But we all know where the wind is blowing. Gru is soon hosting play tea parties and making pinkie promises and reading bedtime stories about kittens... and enjoying it. Now Gru must make a choice. The vagaries of scheduling have set the girls' dance recital on the same date as his go time for the moon caper. What will Gru do? It doesn't matter. Vector means to derail him at any cost.<br /><br />The animation work for DESPICABLE ME was done in France, and there's plenty of that stylized French sensibility in the film's wonderful visual look. This movie has a lot going for it. I like the notion of a Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers) which grants loans for villains to fund their evil projects. I like the absence of a superhero, that the rivalry is instead between two super-villains. Given, Vector - who commits crimes \\"with both direction and magnitude\\" - will remind viewers of Syndrome from THE INCREDIBLES, but anyone who invents a gun which shoots piranhas (except that this gun is real difficult to load) and keeps a shark under his couch is okay in my book. I like the contrast of Vector's shinier, more streamlined tech versus Gru's clunkier, more old school iron vessels and weapons. That the orphan girls would be adorable and sweet is a given. But odds are good that your heart melts when our evil crankypants begins to open his heart. Gru, sinister super-villain, trying to rein in the willful little girls happens to make up my favorite moments in the film.<br /><br />There are even disco boogie-dancing robots. How cool is that?<br /><br />The single DVD's bonus material: Audio Commentary by the Directors Chris Renaud & Pierre Coffin with occasional interjections from Gru's minions; \\"The World of DESPICABLE ME\\" - the Making Of featurette (00:15:16 minutes); \\"Despicable Beats\\" - a quick little segment on Pharrell Williams who composed the film score (00:02:49); \\"Gru's Rocket Builder\\" - an interactive game in which you match a city with its famous landmark; \\"A Global Effort\\" - a focus on the international makeup of the film-making crew (00:03:24); and the DESPICABLE ME game trailer and the DESPICABLE ME Minion Mania App trailer.ized French sensibility in the film's wonderful visual look.

030746363X|5.0|I waited very anxiously for this book to come out. I paid for it ahead of time, and had it downloaded to my Kindle as of midnight, December 14th. Within a day, I realized I wanted a hard copy, so I ordered one from Amazon...actually, I ordered three, because Tim doled out bonus goodies. He's trying to get to the #1 spot. Good luck Tim! Over and above that, he's put together a pretty awesome collection of information. Yeah, some of it's been said before, but Tim manages to combine diet, exercise, and motivation so deftly you don't even realize you've been swept off your feet. His presentation is unmatched! The diet rules are pretty easy, and I'm seeing results in less than a week. I just went out and bought the supplements and I'm looking forward to seeing how much of a difference they make next week. I'm a total science geek, so I love all the facts and physiological background material. For me, knowing why something is likely to be effective makes it much easier to follow. I've recommended it to a couple of friends who are as excited as I am. I already have an accountability partner, which is something I've never done before. If you're serious about losing fat and getting into shape, this is a good place to start. He gives you numerous options for \\"boosts\\" to your personal quest. I'm not likely to take an ice bath, but then again, I may get brave and give it a try. Good luck everyone!

HBO should be ASHAMED & APOLOGIZE to our brave men & women in the US military for making this big piece of pure crap.

My mom sent it to me as a gift....and boy was it one of my favorite gifts so far. My WHOLE house is hardwood or tile and let me tell you, it cleans up floors as fast as it takes you to scale the house. I use it daily and I know it works well because I can see it working and walk around barefoot after without any annoying clingers on the bottom of my feet. I like to use it on bathroom rugs too, but that seems to slow down the motor so you have to lift it up above the carpet a little. The battery works well. I can do the whole house without it dying. Its great! I haven't used a broom or dustpan since!!! :) Well....there was the time the hubby broke a light bulb...but you know what I'm saying. ;)

0316098337|4.0|The story is disturbing. Had I known more about the plot, I might not have purchased the book. But I'm glad that I, knowing little about the story, went ahead and bought it. I was glued to the book's suspense and my eagerness to know the outcome. Without question an entertaining and thought provoking book. There is much that is compressed in the brief novel and some of it is really unsettling (e.g., about the meaning of motherhood and self-hood; dependence and independence; survival and resignation). That, however, is meant to be a hefty compliment. I admit that I grew weary of reading the thoughts/language of a 5-year old and sometimes felt the narrative was overly contrived. But for the most part, the book is delightfully imaginative and one that will invariably leave an impression long after you read the last sentence.
B002ZG981E|1.0|This is a review of the blu ray itself and not of the film Inception.      First and foremost, the audio cuts out and becomes out of sync on my Blu Ray player (Samsung BDP 1600). This usually happens during the opening of the heist scene when they arrive in the warehouse.     Secondly, the behind-the-scene features cut off prematurely.     Beyond these technical problems, the Inception Blu Ray is disappointing due to its poor navigation and lack of truly interesting special features.  The navigation is slow and confusing due to its many nested layers and silly animation.     It's a shame that such a great film was presented in such an unprofessional way.  I suggest renting this edition and waiting for an improved subsequent edition of the Blu Ray disc.

A lesson unfortunately necessary for much of Hollywood right now....
030746363X|5.0|Ok so my review title is a bit lame but bear with me.  I am half way through the book and it all makes sense from the female standpoint of what we should be eating even if we choose not to exercise.  And there isn't a guy alive who shouldn't read the section on female orgasm.  Duh.  Ladies, we need to stop dieting and start eating right.  In the past I've eaten how Tim suggests and I always feel good.  The challenge is the will power for the days we don't get to binge and I don't know if Tim will address that in the later part of the book but everything else makes sense.  Just read the book.  His writing makes me laugh out loud on many occasions and I say to myself \\"no way\\" when I read his body experiments.  Thank you Tim for putting yourself through all that you did so that the rest of us can learn and benefit.  And I have never heard of a guy going to a class to learn how to give orgasms - holy wow, that rocks!  And I'm not going to lie, when Tim talks about his experiments involving his research with women (cough) it's a bit erotic even though he is very professional in how he writes things.  So we have a book that addresses the right things to eat, the right (and very small amount) of exercise to do combined with how men can learn how to please a woman!  What more could we ask for?  Read it!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|My, God. This album enters a new dimension for electric guitar. It is light years away from anything he's ever done. It's real trippy music and super, super funky music like you never heard and lots of experimenting with different instruments including piano and he even has a heavy sound like Ritchie Blackmore in one song. There are so many styles on this album. This is definite head music. I've only listened to half of it and already I'm floored. Hendrix would have definitely approved of this album. I didn't bother to get it when it came out because I didn't like the last few albums much.
030746363X|5.0|This book is a fantastic and well-written account of weight loss and muscle gain. Tim is a fantastic storyteller. The book isn't meant to be read cover to cover. Pick and choose what works for you. Only a few tips are revolutionary. However, it's an excellent baseline and starter point. Highly recommended!
159562015X|5.0|This book really helps, in my oppinion, people to work together as a team. By understanding each others strengths, you can better understand \\"why\\" they do what they do. For instance, the Achiever is a \\"Get it done\\" attitude and instead of inlisting the help of others, which might be part of their job, they will run to get it done, sometimes running over others in the process. They are not bad people, they are amazingly skilled people who don't always realize that their actions sometimes prevent others from being able to do their jobs. Once we realize this, we know why the person acts this way and now we know how to communicate what the concern is.

B001TH16DI|4.0|Okay so i am not going to waste time with extensive reviews of the audio or video quality. i'll just sum up. watching the blu-rays on a high-def set revealed more detail on the films then i noticed before. example : in the voyage home near the beginning when the hijacked bird of prey is still landed on vulcan i can see detailed lines on the ship and clearly make out the people walking around and prepping the ship for take off. visually stunning at a time when big budget CGI shots didn't make or break the movie. it was all about the story and the characters telling it. my positives for the box set are these    -- nice to have the original theatrical cuts of the films. especially The Motion Picture. while the 2 disc directors edition did add a few nice looking CGI shots that i think helped the film i absolutely HATED the remixed audio effects. i am a purist and thought the effects they used in the original cut worked fine and are thankfully used in this version, in all their blairingly loud and drone-voiced splendor.    -- menu design was nice for the discs. easy to find whatever i needed. easy to navigate.    Now the downside...    --- okay so by now we know with the first movie there are 3 different versions of the film. the original theatircal cut, the extended VHS cut and the directors cut. why not do something like they did with i think it was close encounters of the third kind or terminator 2 : judgement day? where they released all 3 versions. (yes there is actually 3 different versions of T2, available on certain versions of the dvd as an easter egg) as other reviewers stated the only movie to get \\"the treatment\\" (and deservedly so) was the wrath of kahn (which i will get to in a minute) so with a 50GB disc there was plenty of room to fit at least 2 versions of the film. it was explained somewhere on some special feature that the new effects shots created for the directors cut dvd were shot in 480P resolution and they couldn't find a way to transfer them properly to blu-ray. but cummon guys... find a way. i mean sure the cut scenes from the extended VHS were added as special features but i want them back into the movie. kinda feeling gyped on that.    -- same thing with the wrath of kahn. there are 2 versions of the movie. i read someone's review that said the extra few minutes \\"dragged it along\\". i think that person needs to lay off the romulan ale because those extra few mins explain alot that the theatrical cut kinda left out. why was scotty so visibly upset over the young engineering officer dying? the directors cut tells us that he was his nephew. okay so the other stuff wasn't as informative as that lil tidbt but once you see the full version of the film it is hard to view it any other way, much in the same way most people disreguard the theatrical cut of Aliens in favor of the extended directors cut. it's full, it's complete and it's not included in this set. i dunno what their reasoning is for excluding the directors cut from the boxed set, other then the fact that they are probably gonna roll out another version of the set to try to rake in yet MORE money. and they know full well we will buy it. and YOU know it too.    -- you know i was really young when i saw it but i recall seeing star trek 6 in the theaters and i gotta tell you... near the end when Valeris is revealing her cohorts to capt. kirk by way of vulcan mindmeld i do not recall them flashing back to little pictures of the people she is naming. and again... the whole extended cut thing is missing.    so all in all it's a good set. just wish the studio gave us the right to choose.... then again when you think about it they kinda did. they gave us the right to choose weather or not to buy the next version of the boxed set (when they finally release it. it's comming. you know it is. just wait)    ......   juuuust waitn'.....
B001IAOEXU|4.0|***  UPDATE: I saw these at Wal-mart today: two sets of the PDP triggers for just under $7, a better rate than one set for $5.  If you want these, and they sure do help A LOT, go get them at Wal-mart!  ***    I'm not gonna lie, when I first got these in the mail and felt them in my hand, I couldn't help but think, \\"Did I really pay $5 for these?\\"  The asking price for two little pieces of plastic does seem kind of high--that is, until you realize that what you are paying for is all in the design.    For most games, I can't see a need for it.  I've played many, many hours of [[ASIN:B00269QLH4 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]] without ever feeling like I was missing something.  And I think that's because as far as functionality in a FPS, the Dualshock 3 controller does very well.  The difference is in a game that requires you to hold down the rear triggers for an extended period of time.  I've recently gotten into [[ASIN:B002ACFYUM Split / Second]] and [[ASIN:B002BRZ7JE ModNation Racers]].  If you want to be competitive in either game, you're not letting go of the pedal for the entire race.    This is a problem with the design of the DS3.  Because of the sloped nature of the rear triggers, your hands are going to slip and you're going to adjust by holding the controller tighter, which means your hands are going to ache sooner and you're going to enjoy your games less.  The PDP triggers lets you keep your foot on the pedal (or your finger on the trigger) with ease.    Here's a tip: you really only need the PDP triggers for the R2 button.  Order one of these to pop on to two controllers; or, if you're playing MNR, order two sets of these and pop one on each of four controllers.  You won't really need it for L2 anyways.    But I'm still going to knock off a star for charging so much for plastic.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great movie.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|This crime drama is one of the year's best movies. It's fast-paced, suspenseful, well acted and scripted. Ben Affleck does a superb job of directing, especially when you consider the fact that the story is not very original. It's a typical heist film but well done and entertaining. I loved the end.
0374158460|2.0|I don't get what people see in this book. There was not one character with whom I could connect. The character's actions were not believable. It was not entertaining. If I had not spent actual money on this book, I would not have finished it. Can't get the time back I wasted reading it, though.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Saw this in Costco for about [...] and bought it on an impulse.  What a great new toy!  I've got piles of LPs and 45 singles from the 60s and 70s.  Havent been able to play them in years and am in the process of converting them all to MP3 for my Ipod.  What a blast to take this walk down memory lane.  I dont understand some of the negative reviews.  It works great.  And yes, I'm using a MAC--one reviewer said it didnt record with his Mac. I installed the Mac compatible software that came with the turntable and it works great.  Very simple and the conversion is FAST.  About 15 seconds per track for the actual conversion process. I love this thing and will finally be able to get all these dust-collecting, space-hogging vinyl records retrieved and then outta here!  Highly recommended.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Okay, this is a movie about the A-Team so I didn't expect too much. I was very pleased with the movie. The A-Team forms in Mexico where their vacation activities include getting tied up, being beaten in the face, and loving it. After the team is formed and Mexico ravaged, we flash 8 years to the future where they are in Iraq. There are some missing counterfeit printing plates that the US government wants. The CIA, Black Forest (Black Water), the regular army, and the A-Team all go after the same plates (actually all it would have taken was one predator drone) and they are in competition with each other to get the plates as opposed to working together.<br /><br />The A-Team recovers the plates, however in a mishap they are stolen and the A-Team all go to jail. Later, the CIA wanting to recover the plates aids the A-Team in escaping from prison. Working as fugitives, our Team goes after the plates having to battle various factions.<br /><br />The movie is action filled. The dialouge is crisp and fun. Character building is light, as there is an assumption you know these people. The plot twists are minor go the movie isn't confusing.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|An excellent film, sensitively acted and directed. From the viewpoint of someone from a Western society the setting in Japanese society is also very interesting.
B00000JGEO|5.0|This movie is dare I say a better send-off of the James Bond movies it has everything you will want and more it's suspensful, action packed, funny without being ridiculous and yes for the ladies romantic. So what are you waiting for ????? Enjoy TRUE LIES but please do not tell anyone it is a secret movie you know.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Northanger Abby is one of my favorite novels by Jane Austen. I really enjoy the light, witty, subtle tone of the book.  It is an excellent book for many reasons, especially the story.  So I purchased this production because I saw it was another project of Andrew Davies and I always enjoy his work.  This is another great one!<br /><br />The story centers around our \\"heroine\\" Catherine Morland who accompanies the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen on their trip to Bath.  Catherine has never been away from home for long periods of time before and this will be her first exposure into society.  She is very naive and innocent but she always tries to do the right thing.  She loves novels and enjoys spending her time reading the popular sensational books of the day such as The Mysteries of Udolpho and The Monk, so she tends to dream a bit like any normal 17 year old young lady.  In Bath is meets a variety of different characters some of them who are not exactly as they seem.  Among them are the charming Henry Tilney, and his kind sister Eleanor. Also she befriends a young woman Isabella Thorpe whose brother John Thrope mistakes her for an heiress.  General Tilney (Henry's father) also falls under this assumption and asks Catherine to accompany them to their home Northanger Abby for a brief stay.  Under these conditions Catherine creates some fanciful suspicions that lead her to some trouble.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic.  J.J Feild shines as Henry Tilney and he captures his outgoing, friendly, funny and charming personality perfectly.  Henry Tilney has always been one of my favorite of Austen's main male characters.  J.J. Feild will certainly find his way into your heart just as Henry Tilney does in the book. Felicity Jones is wonderful as Catherine Morland.  She has her sweet disposition, kind personality, naivety and innocence and makes the audience cheer for her and she learns the hard way that real life is sometimes not so Gothic as her books. Carey Mulligan plays an excellent Isabella Thorpe and she is a real treat to watch in this movie.<br /><br />The one and only problem I had with this whole production was that my favorite line from the book did not make it into the movie.  \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid\\". Henry Tilney is the perfect man!
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|I don't know about everyone else, but my copy of this movie was great! No skipping, no scratches,no problem playing it in my DVD player, etc. I have an excellent copy and thought it was a very good movie. Different than the version staring Donnie Yen, but good story. Very well done. I enjoyed it! I didn't think it was basement quality; and the guy who played Ip Man in this movie, although not well known, did a very good job. He is the Wing Chun World Champion, a true practitioner of the martial art, and the old man in the movie is Ip Man's son. Gives a different perspective and worthy buying....
0385006896|5.0|These stories are such classics. This is the first time I have ever read all of the stories myself. I knew most of the basic details and had seen some of the mini-series but the books are much better. I love trying to solve the case along with Holmes and Watson and I am always amazed by the ability of Holmes to take a minute detail and shape it into a character development. Not only are the mysteries spectacular but the adventures are exciting and the period details descriptions of clothing, modes of transportation and a simple thing like lunch make the book a true classic. It is easy to see why Sherlock Holmes is considered the greatest detective of all time.
B0008237BO|5.0|This album was his best work since Me Against The World, this album is great from start to finish, my only issue with this album is one this, Bone Thugs should have been on \\"Hail Mary\\", they were the perfect fit for that song, other than that this album is a masterpiece!
1453767533|5.0|Though I have read most of Austen's novels some of them numerous times, I have been saving this one for just the right time when I felt like I could appreciate it the most. I finally decided I needed a good Austen fix and was ready to enjoy it. I knew that it is considered by most critics to be Jane Austen's most satirical novel so I was very excited to dive into this book and see for myself. I was not disappointed, I loved our heroine Catherine Morland, I thought she had just the right amount of girlish charm mixed in with some moments of good sense. I found myself routing for her throughout the book. I also have to say that Henry Tilney found his way right into my heart from almost the first meeting, especially when he exclaims, \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid\\", a opinion I agree with entirely.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I dont want to spend to much of your time here , just go for it The Town is a perfect movie !
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|When the TV series ended I felt that it ENDED. Let it go. But the fans \\"demanded\\" that it continue. OK so they make a movie that was well received. Big and Carrie got married. OK its over. Let it go. Again, the fans wanted more. So they reached for another story where no story was needed and everyone calls it crap. What do you expect. The story is over, folks. Anything else to be said is just going to be fluff. And this movie was a big, fluffy, over the top, unrealistic marshmallow.   There is nothing more to say. Besides, the girls are starting to look a little like the over-the-hill gang. They've long since ceased being \\"girls\\" and are coming dangerously close to dirty old ladies. So it really is time to just let it go.  It really was preposterous and unbelievable but I still enjoyed it and would go see another if they make one (not that they need to make one).  I really do not appreciate that the DVD version (not the blue ray) does not contain the directors commentary. This is unacceptable. I hope later editions do include it because it is on the blue ray version.  There is no reason they couldnt have just put it on the dvd version as well.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade has simple lyrics. BUT they are so profound at the same time. Her voice can soothe like few others. The title says it all, the BEST of Sade.
0312600844|5.0|I'm always glad when a book is such an event, something everyone's talking about.  I bought this book and read it evey chance I could.  I loved the opening, it felt a bit like a paraphrased reality TV episode.  The long \\"autobiographical\\" piece in 3rd person was a bit jarring but I got used to it.  I think I read the expression \\"stridently unlikable\\" to describe the characters, and that is somewhat true.  But by the end of the book (maybe because one has become so used to them), one develops a sneaky sympathy for the characters.  The book is billed by many critics as a kind of \\"novel of our times\\" that describes life in contemporary America.  I'm not so sure; maybe a certain over-achieving, self-critical, neurotic, suburban / urban set but I have a hard time believing that the Berglands are typical people.  I'm sure there are a lot who resemble them, but typical, no.  Setting this aside however, once I got over the fact that I didn't particularly like these people or find them engaging in any form, I grew interested in their stories, their interractions and their collision with the various events that have shaped our time.  And I'm still thinking about Patty-Walter-Richard.
B00447G2MK|5.0|ADTR is the band of a certian generation, we know who we are and I believe that they are still making music true to who they are.  Alot of their songs are about be hated or that they sold out but I love what they are doing and cant complain about this album.  Alot of people believed this would be a softer album and Jeremy and Co. brought it the hard riffs and catchy hooks that we all have learned to love.  Great album and really proud that ADTR is staying true to the bands vision.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|People seem to have short attention span these days; but I get such a kick out of extended view movies.

I could have watched another 1/2 hour.    Topsy
B001BO184Q|4.0|I am writing this review in the running up to Christmas. That is why I would like to promote the eminence of this item as a boxed gift set--costing even less than a KFC Family Feast (some $30 here at Amazon, or below £20 at UK websites like MDT and Presto). An insane comparison? Actually not, as I believe most families would be far better off with Puccinian calories during the season holidays rather than yet more junk-food dittos.<br /><br />What EMI provides for this tiny amount is the complete Puccini operas on 17 discs, save Edgar and most of Le Villi. Indeed, Decca has a competing offer on [[ASIN:B000YCLR6K 15 discs]], priced even lower here (not so in the UK, though); its main strength lies in Decca's superior sound quality--astonishingly thrilling and lifelike for the 1950s--whereas Tebaldi's featuring in every single opera is not consistently an asset (e.g. Mimi and Cio-Cio-San).<br /><br />EMI has, like Decca, included only stereo recordings, which means that some of the most acclaimed opera recordings ever made--the [[ASIN:B002N4DZ30 1953 Callas/Sabata Tosca]] and the [[ASIN:B000063UM0 1956 Beecham La Boh&egrave;me]]--had to be excluded. There are certainly no bad recordings here, but at the same time few first choices: only the fabulous 1958 Gobbi/Angeles/Santini Gianni Schicchi and Nilsson's 1962 assumption of Turandot would qualify without hesitation. On the other hand, it would be hard to impossible to gather these 10.1 operas from one label and do any better in terms of overall quality than this.<br /><br />Manon Lescaut features Caball&eacute;/Domingo/Bartoletti from 1971 in a somewhat weird performance, mainly let down by the sound which is both one-dimensional and unnatural, making Domingo's des Grieux sounding coarse (cf his [[ASIN:B000N4SJK6 remake with Freni]] on DG)--although Bartoletti's conducting is at least one level below that of Levine and Sinopoli, amounting to the low point of the set.<br /><br />La Boh&egrave;me with Freni/Gedda/Sereni/Adani/Schippers was taped in 1962/3 when Freni's voice was purity defined. By today's standards it is a very good reading, but when compared to [[ASIN:B0000041TD Freni's 1972 platinum remake]] with Pavarotti and Karajan, it sounds a bit dull and under-characterised--which, on the other hand, holds true for any other version. All the same, Gedda's unromantic and essentially non-Italianate Rodolfo is a drawback.<br /><br />The 1964/5 Tosca with Callas/Bergonzi/Gobbi/Prêtre is controversial in the sense that it offers a stereo remake of the infinitely praised 1953 'definitive' version, which caught the arguably greatest trio of Italianate voices in their prime. As much as I love that classic recording, I am exceedingly pleased to add the remake in far superior sound, Gobbi sounding possibly even more evil as Scarpia, Bergonzi replacing di Stefano as a sweeter Cavaradossi, and Callas outshining her younger self in delivering the most complete, three-dimensional assumption of the supreme dramatic-soprano role (naturally, her infamous high notes cannot compete with the decade-earlier performance, but they are stable enough not to ruin the show).<br /><br />Madama Butterfly cast with Angeles/Bj&ouml;rling/Santini from 1959 is a truly great recording (I do not worry about the close miking nearly as much as others do). The problem here, though, is that Butterfly may be the ultimate 'listen-only' opera, which is why there are several other great versions, of which at least [[ASIN:B0000041S8 Freni/Pavarotti/Karajan]] and [[ASIN:B000G03Q46 Scotto/Bergonzi/Barbirolli]] are overall preferable.<br /><br />The sadly underrated La fanciulla del West gets a very good reading from Nilsson/Gibin/Mongelli/Matacic, recorded in 1958. Regrettably, the sound is stereo but rather limited, whereas Gibin's Johnson does sound like a non-star performance. Even if Nilsson may be the greatest Minnie on record, I still prefer [[ASIN:B000174LUM Neblett/Domingo/Milnes/Mehta]] overall.<br /><br />This is my first encounter with La Rondine, here given by Gheorghiu/Alagna/Pappano. I do not have any quibbles with the performance, which earned the Gramophone Record of the Year accolade in 1997, but rather with the light, forgettable operetta music that does not show Puccini from his best side. That said, at £2 including excerpts from the Second Act of Le Villi as well as 'Morire?' for voice and piano (Alagna & Pappano), who am I to complain?<br /><br />Il trittico's three one-act operas are dominated by Pappano conducting the LSO and Philharmonia in excellent sound from the late-1990s: Il tabarro features an underrated Shicoff, whereas Geulfi and Guleghina sound mediocre at best (the latter's voice turns rather unpleasant above the stave); Suor Angelica stars Gallardo-Domâs who sings adequately, if without much personality; alas, di Nissa's outright ugly La zia principessa ruins an otherwise atmospheric and well-conducted performance.<br /><br />Saving the best for second-to-last, indeed the last part of Il trittico: Gobbi in the hilarious Gianni Schicchi is pure operatic gold, with de los Angeles appropriately angelic in the ubiquitous 'O mio babbino caro', Santini finding the ideal balance between farce and seriosity, and EMI's 1958 sound surpassing the label's normal quality.<br /><br />Nilsson's 1965 Turandot could have been the greatest on record, had not Pavarotti, Caball&eacute; and Ghiaurov joined the [[ASIN:B0000041Q3 1972 Decca performance]] and Karajan not conducted the [[ASIN:B000001G9X 1981 DG account]]. Even though Nilsson remains unsurpassed as the ice princess, Corelli, Scotto and Giaiotti cannot quite match the Decca cast (only let down by Sutherland in the title role), and Molinari-Pradelli with the Rome orchestra are no match for the spell Karajan weaves with the VPO.<br /><br />If it is too late to get this set for Christmas, at least make sure you have it by New Year.not have any quibbles with the performance, which earned the Gramophone Record of the Year accolade in 1997, but rather with the light, forgettable operetta music that does not show Puccini from his best side.

B00461MY30|4.0|I don't want to devalue the music by giving the set a low rating but, really, with the success of The Beatles and Dylan's mono reissues where are the key unreissued mono Stones albums?  With the exception of just two or three songs, ABKCO has basically already released the earliest Stones stuff in mono in their big remastering campaign of a few years ago. What we really need from them now are Aftermath, Between the Buttons, Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet in their original mono mixes.  The first three listed, in particular, have typically horrible 60s style stereo mixes with hard separation and virtually no center. I don't romanticize vinyl  but I would have plunked down for this set if nice new mono pressings of those albums had been included.

1843794411|4.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />I excerpted much of the following from the website Heyerlist dot org which says it well - what to expect when you read this book.<br /><br />The Earl of Rule (Rule) is 35, proud, wealthy.  He has a pleasant, mocking, lazy charm which belies his keen mind and iron will.<br /><br />The Winwood family has title but no money.  Rule doesn't know much about her but decides to marry the eldest daughter Elizabeth.  Horatia (Horry) is 17 and the younger sister.  Horry goes to Rule and tells him Elizabeth loves another and that Horry would like to marry Rule instead.  She has heard that men like him have mistresses and Horry assures him she will not interfere with that.  Horry admits to Rule her flaws - she has straight, thick black eyebrows, a pronounced stammer, and is short.  They marry.  Horry is mischievous, honest, frank, high-spirited, and has inherited her family's tendency to gamble.  She gets into numerous scrapes.<br /><br />Three people try to cause problems with the marriage, Rule's mistress, Lethbridge who wants to hurt Rule in any way he can, and Crosby (Rule's cousin who is further removed from inheriting Rule's wealth now that he is married).  Pel is Horry's brother who gambles and drinks too much.  Pel plans various schemes to help Horry get out of messes.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I didn't want to stop reading.  I wanted to know what would happen.  I loved Horry's zestful spirit, refreshing honesty, and her roguish charm.  Part of the draw was I kept hoping and waiting for Rule and Horry to fall in love.  Rule stopped seeing his mistress and I wanted Horry to know about it, but she didn't.  I was chuckling a few times at the ridiculous plans and actions of Horry's brother Pel trying to help her.  Pel's actions were silly but entertaining.<br /><br />One part is probably more humorous hearing it as an audiobook than reading it.  Pel puts on a mask and attempts to rob a horse-drawn carriage.  He shoots his gun to stop the horses and yells \\"Stand and deliver.\\"  The narrator says this with a British accent which was funny.  It's so different from American westerns where the robber says \\"This is a holdup\\" or \\"This is a stickup.\\"<br /><br />The author is very good with dialogue which a lot of current day authors should do more of.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY:<br />The narrator Caroline Hunt has a pleasant voice, but the recording was hard to hear - as if too many low tones and not enough treble.  At times I had to turn up the volume which was not a good solution.  I don't know if the problem was her voice or the equipment used to record this.  I downloaded the version with the best quality audio.<br /><br />CAUTION SPOILER:<br />Horry and Rule finally communicate that they love each other during the last few sentences of the book.  I wanted another chapter or epilogue to experience the love and to see their feelings and interactions AFTER that moment.  That would have taken it to 5 stars for me.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook length: 9 ½ hours.  Narrator: Caroline Hunt.  Swearing language: none.  Sexual content: none.

Deathly Hallows Part I, has very successfully built up the suspense and the curiosity of the myriad of Potter fans, who will now wait restlessly for the final climax of the series. Followers of Harry Potter and his two friends, who have grown up simultaneously with the fictional trio, would have found the confusions, frustrations and rage of the stormy teenage years very familiar. The plot deals with a lot of real emotions, the emotions and aches of growing up, of being challenged. There is jealousy, anger and empathy--these human emotions mark a departure of Deathly from the bravado and mindless adventures of the earlier Potter flicks.<br /><br />Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the numerous attacks of the Death Eaters, let loose by Voldemort. The killing mission includes a high adrenalin chase of Harry and his seven look-alikes by the blood thirsty gang, which is a high point of the movie, visually. Potter and friends escape into the wilderness, but the Death Eaters' attacks never come to an end, and their goons capture and take them to the lair.<br /><br />The trio escapes from the dungeon with the help of elf Dobby who pays with his life in the effort to release them. Dobby's death in the lap of Harry Potter brings about the most poignant scene in the movie. Now Harry and friends come to learn about the Deathly Hallows, based on some symbols and their intuitions. Hermione's reading of the story about the seven deathly hallows is accompanied by a symbolic enactment, which is very captivating and will remain deeply etched in the viewer's mind for long.<br /><br />While the development of the plot is very intelligent and flawless, there are certain issues about the pace of the movie. Some parts drag, especially the lengthy discussions and deliberations. The many ifs and buts during the unfolding of the plot frustrate the viewer, used to the fast pace of the childhood adventure and games of the earlier movies. Most of the action takes place in the outside world, away from the all too familiar school premises. That's a welcome change.<br /><br />Finally the fights and misunderstandings between Harry and Ron depict the coming of age of the chums.<br /><br />The die-hard fans will surely revel in the movie despite the fact the director David Yates has taken a lot of liberty about his selection of which part of the book to include in the movie and which to leave out.  For the uninitiated, though, this random and non-linear selection may appear quite disjointed and confusing.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of 'Hits and Misses's.

B002ONC9NC|3.0|\\"An Education\\" is just \\"a movie,\\" and by that I mean it could (and should) have been better. It takes place in 1961 London. There is Jenny, a very bright and lovely almost 17-year-old girl, an only child, in her final year at a private school, taking her A-levels, on track to Oxford. Jenny's parents, at first, are depicted as boring, stodgy, humorless, cold, grasping, and a bit dense, really. They aren't wealthy - Jenny's father works for a living - they are what we would today call lower upper middle class. Jenny's father relentlessly pushes her to study hard and excel, but his interest in education seems only to be a means for his daughter to meet the right sort of \\"chap\\" who will, through marriage, raise the entire family higher up on the social scale.<br /><br />At school Jenny seems to be the only student who shows any serious academic interest, as well as interest in art, music, and French, subjects which, as her father says, are \\"not on the syllabus.\\" Jenny has big dreams of a life well lived, of hobnobbing with intellectuals, of romance and adventure. In short, the opposite of her parents' life and that of the teachers at her school.<br /><br />Then Jenny meets an older man, maybe forty. She's a bit smitten with him from the beginning because he is handsome, charming, rich, funny, worldly, artsy, and there are \\"so many things he'd like to show her.\\" With other adult friends, they go to concerts, dinners at chic night clubs, art auctions. Jenny is just 16, but with her knowledge of art and music, her fluent French, her quick-witted intellectual insights and humor, and her genuine, non-jaded appreciation for \\"the good life,\\" she fits right in with the freewheeling adults. Her school performance begins to suffer. Jenny's parents aren't concerned, because David, the older man, has charmed the socks off of them, too. The parents think that David is Jenny's ticket (and theirs, too) to higher social status.<br /><br />Now it's time for movie spoilers - if you don't want them, stop here. Jenny begins to discover that David (and his partner, Danny) are nothing more than scammers and con artists. That's how they make all of their money. When Jenny realizes this, her first reaction is to leave, but David somehow convinces her that there are \\"really clever girls like her,\\" and then, not so clever ones like him who have to make their living as criminals. In an echo of what Jenny's father had said, David says that \\"money doesn't grow on trees.\\" You need lots of money to buy expensive clothes, go to concerts, and visit Paris. David says, with a charming self-effacing smile and a shrug of the shoulders, \\"This is who I am.\\" I would have expected this entreaty, as open and sincere as it was, to inspire Jenny to run, not walk, away from this man. Even if she were willing to overlook his taking advantage of other people, how could she ever expect to trust him? How could she enjoy the high life knowing it was purchased with tainted money?<br /><br />The reason is that Jenny believes the only alternative is death, a life worse than death, such as the life of her parents or her teachers. She believes that even if she were to go to Oxford, after graduation she would still face a deadly boring life, and all of her study and hard work would be for naught.<br /><br />Jenny quits school and accepts David's proposal of marriage. Jenny's parents are ecstatic. As mentioned earlier, the only reason Jenny's father wanted Jenny to go to Oxford was for her to meet and marry a fine gentleman. So much the better that she had managed to do so without the expense of Oxford.<br /><br />But then, in the midst of celebrations for the engagment, we discover something new about David, something which Jenny is not willing to overlook. No, it's not more criminal activity. It's the oldest of all stories, the almost trite bane of older men seducing younger women - he's married, with kids. In fact, David's happy little family lives right around the corner from Jenny's house. David tells Jenny that he was going to tell her when the time was right. He says that he doesn't know why she's making such a fuss about it. But Jenny has SOME principles after all. She realizes that she's thrown away a year of school and her chance to get into Oxford, for a married man who really had no intention of marrying her. You see, he's done this before, and some of the other mistresses have had children. As I said, an old story.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see is a new story. I would have liked to see Jenny choose to leave David, without the obvious obstructions of betrayal and marriage. She didn't leave him because she didn't want to be with him; she left him because she couldn't be with him. She didn't make a choice, the choice was made for her. I didn't expect this story to take the easy way out, and I felt disappointed when it did.<br /><br />There is a happy ending. Jenny repeats her year of studies and gets into Oxford. But one more note about that: There is no adult in the story who can provide a decent answer to Jenny's legitimate question about what all the hard work is for, and what makes life worth living, rather than boring. Of all the people who could have answered that question and helped Jenny avoid some of the mistakes she made, it was Miss Stubbs, her English Lit teacher, a teacher who really cared about Jenny and the most intelligent and level-headed adult in the film. But for reasons not at all clear, Miss Stubbs allows Jenny to go off the deep end.<br /><br />I give this movie 3 stars. I enjoyed watching it, but it turned out to be the \\"same old same old,\\" a young woman seduced and fooled by an older married man. Jenny should have left him for being a criminal. After all, isn't being a criminal worse than being a philanderer? :-)g to tell her when the time was right. He says that he doesn't know why she's making such a fuss about it.

0784010188|5.0|Every cast member was great in this sequel to \\"Terminator.\\"  In my humble opinion, Linda Hamilton provided an Oscar-worthy performance of a highly distraught/borderline insane protector of her son.  Her transformation from \\"Terminator\\" to \\"T2\\" was amazing and displayed the range of Hamilton's acting ability.  Though Arnold certainly provides the gravitas, Hamilton provides the fragile consciousness of a human being besieged by a horrific reality and destiny.  Kudos too for Edward Furlong for portraying an inescapably repressed yet resourceful teenager.  I was stupefied and angry that Hamilton and Furlong were dumped for T3.<br /><br />I'm a Christian Bale fan, but I was disappointed that he totally ignored Furlong's early sculpture of the eventual resistance-fighter John Conner.  A bit of continuity would have helped the franchise.  It's a pity that James Cameron let this fascinating drama slip out of his hands.  He dumped Linda Hamilton and everything connected with \\"Terminator.\\"  The same thing happened after he directed \\"Aliens.\\"  I don't know the Hollywood politics behind any of this, but I can't help but view Cameron as a fair-weather friend.  His success with \\"Avatar\\" is deserved but the drama of the flick is not up to the caliber of \\"Terminator\\" or \\"Aliens.\\"<br /><br />So, now, Linda Hamilton has seemingly disappeared from major theatrical releases.  Whatever the particulars, I can't help but feel sorry for her, as she turned in a stunning performance with \\"T2.\\"  Maybe there will be a place for her in the next \\"Hellboy\\" movie.  I hope to see her again.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|My mono boxed set arrived today and the first amazing thing is that it got to me in Soutern New Zealand in 5 days including a weekend.....gret shipping.  I ordered both the mono set and the stereo but the stereo is still in transit.  Just to get started I picked two songs of each album almost at random. I was blown away, the clarity, the punch, the brilliance of the music was fnally there. Some tracks that I was never that keen on are suddenly wonderful. The difference to previous releases is obvious and there are many differences that just enhance the songs.  I purchased the two sets for my 60th birthday, best decision I have made in ages.    Never mind the price, which was hugely reduced, my advice would be buy both sets and spend the rest of your life finally heariung the beatles as they wanted us to hear then!    There is a God and he lives at Apple studies,    JOHN ALLDRED  NEW ZEALAND
B00000ILDE|5.0|Each time I watch \\"Aliens\\" I become miffed that Sigourney Weaver did not receive an Oscar for her performance.  She carried the film from start to finish, displaying a complicated set of emotions -- far beyond the standard best actress list.  She took on new ground and did so with an indelible virtuosity.  I suppose if it weren't for the stigma of the film being a science fiction story, she might have garnered what she deserved.  Accolades and awards should go to those who are most deserving despite the genre.  Perhaps with an award going to Heather Ledger, the crap tables will change.  Maybe all you have to do is die to accumulate the attention and praise deserving of the role in which one played.
B00192IV9U|5.0|It's simply a wonderful album. You won't be disappointed. All songs have MJ's vocals on them.  Saying otherwise is ridiculous.
030745455X|4.0|I am shocked at all of the horrible reviews this book received. I actually loved the story, and I loved seeing so much more of Lisbeth. I do agree with a lot of the negative points. Coffee is almost another character in the book, and after reading so many comments on the excessive coffee drinking in the first book, it was almost comical how much coffee the characters drank in this one. There are a lot of minor characters with odd names and they became really hard to keep track of. They reminded me of the Vanger family - in the end, it didnt matter who was who - the people who were integral to the story you knew.<br /><br />My only other con is the ending (spoiler!). I dont really understand what happened - wasnt Lisbeth shot 3 times with real bullets? Didnt they bury her in a shallow grave? How is it that she is still alive?? And what happened once Bloomqvist showed up?<br /><br />I can look past Lisbeth's superhero powers. In my mind, her crazy computer skills, lack of social awareness, photographic memory, super math ability -- all are part of what Pomgren labeled Asperger's. It made her an interesting, quirky character. I loved her. I loved everything about her. I didnt find her shopping lists annoying - they were like a catalog of what she was buying, the way that Lisbeth was probably thinking through her shopping trip. It made sense to me. I had to stop listening right at the part where she was shot and buried because I had to go to a dinner party. I was so upset the whole night and couldnt wait to get back to the story.<br /><br />As large as the book is, I think it is action packed, has great characters and moves quickly.<br />I cant wait for the last installment!
B002OT730K|4.0|Not as dynamic as Yas Yas, for sure, but all songs are performed dynamically and with typical Stones energy.  What has always struck me as weird and extraordinary is side three (originally on the vinyl and still mixed before the main show's conclusion here), the absolutely fabulous club set at El Mocambo, the Stones away from spectacle and on a small stage, doing blues/reggae and being sweaty and intimate.  These four tracks, tantalizing and far too short, represent the real Rolling Stones.  Had the entire album comprised the club set, it would rate, what, SIX stars!  Then again, without those precious few songs, maybe three.  You will treasure those special songs and play them far more than you will the rest of the album.  As you will imagine Margaret Trudeau, reportedly in attendance, sitting at a corner table in the dark, getting off on the down-in-the-basement band that rarely appears but knocks these blues out of the park here.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Very very good CD.  I have always liked Annie Lenox, so her Christmas CD was perfect.  Recommend to all!!!
1577314808|5.0|The book is great. This is the second book I've read with this author and I've found it to be a pleasant learning experience.  It has answered several questions without compromise.  It is the kind of book that does give one hope. I plan on reading more of the author's writings to help me fulfill my spiritual needs.  I recommend this book highly for those with very strong pain bodies, which refers to a large part of humanity.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Before I begin let me just start by congratulating the director on an exceptionally well thought out cast. I mean I liked all the characters in the film and continuity was super. Mark Ruffalo must be having a really good personal life or something because he has come a long way from the man standing in the shadows of a shot  -> to a man who can just about carry such a difficult role with such ease.<br /><br />It aches me to see that films like this don't get enough recognition when you compare their success with BLOCKBUSTERS. Anyway, the film has the kind of TITLE which would make me watch it anyway unless it was an animation, then I'd think twice.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo gets my honors for playing the role of PAUL with remarkable ease and my heart warmed to his character very early in the film .<br /><br />Moving on, Annette Bening - well - where does one begin. She's definitely the star of the film besides the older of the two child actors.<br /><br />Julianne Moore has come along way but age has not taken away from just how contemporary and sexy her look is in some scenes of the film.<br /><br />This film is more than the storyline will throw at you. It talks about loneliness, togetherness, love, lust, sperm donation, questioning your kids sexuality and such random things in life without ever discerning the viewer.<br /><br />I also loved the character names of JONI and LAZER and not to forget JULES.<br /><br />Running with Scissors and The Upside of Anger are EXAMPLES of similar films that tried hard but failed to move me but THE KIDS ARE ALL ALRIGHT is where the FILM-DIRECTOR (if I can put them all in one bracket) gets it right.<br /><br />Anybody who misses the charm of films like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. STEP MOM or let's say THE SQUID AND THE WHALE will not be disappointed by this film.<br /><br />This is the sort of film HBO will play for the next decade or two.<br /><br />PS - it was good to see an indian kid play a small/ half important role
B000005JA8|5.0|excuse me this album from 1969 is better than anything recorded since 1985 I have to fight off these 1 star reviews they are all frightened like its the scariest movie ever made...it's just a record. People now are putting mostly dismal stuff that makes Trout look like the Beatles or Miles Davis catalog this 2000 2010 or 2020 era same thing its suks lot of bad music these days that you think is good because of the fear that all these young idiot musicians are playing making or not non inventive boring is what is happening NOW...IT IS....its mainly a instrument technology corporation that sells alot of stuff that anyone can buy and form a stinky band
1580176941|5.0|I have a lot of cook books, and a ton of cookie recipes.  I bought this book last year, but finally got around to trying it out to make my Christmas cookies this year.  I used the sugar cookie and gingerbread recipes, and a few of their decorating techniques.  What fabulous results!  Using their shaping techniques (parchment paper is a kitchen blessing) I made beautiful cookies that held their shape and looked almost exactly like what I put into the oven. The icing recipes are easy to make, and the decorating ideas are easy to follow.  I'm far from being a professional, but these cookies look better than store-bought.  But the best thing about these cookies is how delicious they are!  With this kind of \\"cosmetically perfect\\" results, I expected something hard, chalky, and spackle-like.  But my cookies came out tender, tasty, spicy, buttery, yummy, happy-otter-dance good!  I intend to try more of these recipes and decorating ideas in the future.  I always knew I could make good cookies, but now I know I can make pretty cookies.  And that makes me happy.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Too often, Hollywood devolves into Marxist propaganda at the cost of the film's dignity.  Not so with Toy Story 3, which delivers a scathing and concise dissection of the human atrocities all too familiar with Socialism and Communism.  Bravo for Disney and Pixar to tackle these issues so beautifully.
B002ZG980U|1.0|i loved christopher nolans earlier indie film momento although i would have prefered less profanity.....inception had one good 3 minute scene where the city appeared to be walked on by leos character in a 90 deegree angle...after a hour and a half i gave up on this film before revisiting the last 50 minutes....ellen pages voice from her earlier film was a distraction, can she change that voice for some films would help
B003FSTN52|4.0|This is a well-acted well written show.  While understated there are various plot lines going on, thus it never becomes rote or boring.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I've always liked niche text-based adventures with some puzzles thrown in. If you like the Ace Attorney series, you'll love this game. The story is deep and engaging. No cheesy voice acting, yet the characters really draw you in. It'll keep you guessing \\"who's the bad guy?\\". There are 6 possible endings depending on your choices throughout the game. The puzzles aren't that hard, probably because the game focuses more on the story. After getting the first few endings, it does get a little tiring to keep doing the same puzzles over and over to get the other endings.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I bought all 3 Toy Story movies for my nephew's daughter and son - ages 3 and 5. They live out in the boonies - no tv reception or movie theatres nearby - so they depend on videos for their entertainment. I KNOW they will love this series. It's the least an Auntie can do :-)
B004EKCNMA|1.0|This is the worst version I have ever seen!!!  The fist two ghosts were silly and totally out of character.  And what did the sequence where Scrooge is shrunk add to the story at all? Please don't waste your money or your time.
030746363X|1.0|This book is basically irrelevant. It´s filled with useless things a regular person cannot do. I am not willing to stuff my face for 28 days and do thousand of hours just to gain muscle. Tim is not a scientist, and not a doctor, and he can't go around saying thousands of years of scientific and medical research are wrong. I have a regular job, as most of us do, and don't live on money I make on selling cheap self help books. I'm not a fan of this guy but got the book as a gift (now I'm thinking the person who gave me this must have somehow thought I was dumb). I also know he sent out an email saying \\"Let's break the record for selling most books.\\" You've got to be kidding me.     The truth of the matter is, if you want to lose weight, exercise and eat less. There's no shortcut. And the part of the 15 minute orgasm? What a joke. I thought he meant the orgasm would LAST 15 minutes, not that you can get one in 15 minutes. You can get one in 5 minutes even. An orgasm is simply a series of vaginal contractions which can be obtained through stimulation. It is not something you do with a how to guide. You're better of researching on the Internet.    Don't waste your time and money and don't give any more money to this narcissistic self centered monkey. His head is already inflated enough.

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Socially, emotionally handicapped Temple perseveres against her permanent weaknesses and peoples' prejudices.  Beautifully photographed, thoughtful story-telling about people who think visually, about finding things that work for their well being and happiness.  What if you lost something critical, say a a leg - how would you live, survive, mitigate your loss?  This movie is also about parents, family, and friends who encourage the handicapped and wounded.  I was greatly inspired.  Highly recommend watching it a second time with the narration turned on where Temple, the director, and story writer talk about the movie scenes; also inspiring.

B003INBNXO|4.0|Just recently seen this film and let me say it is AWESOME! Wanna know where the late, great Bruce Lee got the basis for his skills? Check out this film!    On the film itself, the music score and action are amazing! Donnie Yen does a good job in bringing Ip Man to life in this movie! I will warn, however, this film isn't for little kids. This is more for the tweens to adult crowd. While there isn't much bad language in the movie, there is a lot of violence!    Ip Man begins the film as a wealthy but kind family man who teaches his kung fu form popularly known as Wing Chung. When the Japanese invade his country, he and his family are forced from their home and Ip Man is forced to work in the mines to provide for them. His rage over the injustices heaped upon him, his family and his countrymen come out when he witnesses one of his former fellow teachers executed needlessly. From there, Ip Man goes on a mission to not only fight the invading Japanese but united his countrymen against the Japanese during the early stages of World War II.    Worth the buy! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0439023491|4.0|In my opinion, this sequel is not quite as good as the first, The Hunger Games, but continues the suspense and thrilling story of intertwined fates and confusion of a futuristic world. Katniss finds herself always stuck between two lives, and is constantly trying to decide which to follow. Everyone wants her on their side, or dead. Somehow, she's the only one who can choose what the whole country will do, yet no one will help her decide what to choose.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was bored one evening, and was browsing around looking for something to watch, and I saw this movie, and didn't know one single thing about it. I had never even heard of it. Well, I started watching it and I was hooked from the first 5 minutes! I stayed up late into the night watching it because I simply could NOT turn it off! I had to know what was going to happen next! The acting is AMAZING in this movie and Richard Armitage (Mr. Thorton) in this movie is so DREAMY!!! He is an AMAZING actor and has so much talent! I never thought, when I was bored that night looking for any movie to watch, that I would have found my FAVORITE movie of all time!!! This one is definitley a keeper for me. I have already ordered the novel and I can't WAIT to read it! I have already watched it about 5 times, and everytime I watch it, I see something new. You will NOT be dissapointed in this movie....so go watch it now!!!!
0618918248|1.0|I must say this is one of the most VERBOSE book I've ever read.  There's a quote from someone, somewhere in almost every page.   This is also my primary disappointment in that the author did nothing other than \\"sort\\" the various pieces of information (paper that someone published, dumb things someone said, etc) and use that to form his own opinions and conclusions.   I'll use a quote myself for this review, from Kant: \\"enlightenment is man's exit from his self-incurred minority. Minority is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.\\"    That said, this book is anything but enlightened since nothing in it really came from Dawkins... ask your next door atheist and he'll probably give you the same arguments as Dawkins have.  There are several fundamental flaws in this book, a few of which:    - The relationship between religion and God.   God is God. Religion is man's worship of God.  The author builds on this misconception of religion (and the wars it causes) as a case against the existence of God.   He mentions in one paragraph, for example, of how Pope John Paul II attributed the survival of his assassination attempt to \\"Our Lady of Fatima\\"... Why didn't she guide the bullet to miss him altogether?   Were all the other saints busy at that time?   While this is a hilarious remark, it's also most irrelevant as far as God's existence goes.     Unfortunately, the author spends a significant portion of the book doing this type of \\"rant\\" against religion (rather than God) to the point that it becomes tedious and boring to read.    - The misconception of evolution.  By definition, evolution is the change of inherited traits through successive generations.  This change is caused primarily by mutation.   For example, humans have the same 99% DNA content as a fish, and a mutation in DNA can cause a man to develop gills and breathe underwater.  If a cataclysmic disaster were to happen and flood the whole Earth, then the circus freaks with gills on their necks will live while the rest of us dies.   This is evolution through natural selection.   The point here is that the DNA that causes man to form gills already exists.   DNA itself doesn't evolve-- i.e. your descendants 50,000 years from now won't grow gills just because you like to *swim a lot*.        The author uses evolution too liberally.  Like most atheists, he takes evolution all the way back to the single cell organism, even when there is no proof that man's DNA evolved from a single cell organism  (this is a theory, not a scientific fact, as plausible as it may sound).   He also tries to apply human morality in the context of Darwinian evolution -- i.e. we are moral towards each other because of genetic kinship, repayment of favors, acquiring reputation, and \\"buying unfakeably authentic advertising.\\" -- and yes, much of this idea is not his own, and there's nothing inherently deep about the concept that your next door atheist neighbor couldn't think of on a Sunday afternoon.    - Rather than providing a SOLID, DEEP argument for the NON-existence of God, Dawkins spends much of his time \\"debunking\\" religion, especially Christianity.   The type of arguments he provides against Christianity is typical atheist:    1) I go to hell because I'm not Christian?  What kind of God is that?  2) The stuff in the bible sounds awful -- incest, bestiality, people killed by an angry God, etc... I wouldn't want my kids reading it.  3) I can't believe some people think the earth is 4,000 years old.    You probably get the picture: the author builds on the logical/rational fallacy of one's belief as a case against the existence of God.    If anything, the only good point this book makes is that there are A LOT more atheists (and hypocrites) than most people think.   There are many people, for example, who stay in their religion just because their parents belong to it, while they themselves don't really believe in God.    In this respect, the book makes a valid point.You are what you DO, not simply what you believe.   For example, over 75% of Americans identify themselves as Christians, and if this number were truly the case, 75% of brides would be virgins since they wouldn't do such a thing as \\"fornication.\\"    A quick look on the \\"Friends\\" sitcom clearly tells you that American culture is already an atheist one.    I do, however, want to clarify one thing about Christianity that this author is consistently clueless about.   A Christian is not someone who accepts Jesus as his God, but someone whom Jesus accepts as his follower.  This is the difference between faith that comes from humility, and one that comes from self-righteousness.   Self-righteousness causes wars, not religion nor God.  Truth doesn't lie in religion but in the person who accepts it.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan turn in excellent performances in this film. Sadly, the film itself is just good. The director, Roman Polanski, has lost his edge, and mostly phoned in this effort.<br /><br />The Ghost Writer is a who done it mystery set within hypothetical recent political events. The mystery is not complex, and once resolution sets in at the end, there really isn't much of a surprise. Nick (Ewan McGregor) is hired to ghost write Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoir, the previous ghost writer turned up dead.<br /><br />This film is well worth watching for the performances by Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan. McGregor is a quiet, polite, subdued Englishman that is just smart enough and just curious enough. Brosnan lost all his put on style from Remington Steele, and James Bond days; and he is thankfully no longer the pig from The Matador. He plays a former Prime Minister that was elected to represent every man. Brosnan has just enough class and crass to pull this role off. Polanski extracted wonderful performances out of both men.<br /><br />James Belushi is a huge surprise in this film, with a very short appearance as a bald publisher. The transformation from his previous roles is incredible. I hardly recognized Kim Cattrall as Amelia, Adam Lang's secretary. She had a demure sternness and sensuality, a far cry from the Sex in the City role she has come to play in almost every movie. The rest of the supporting cast was very good.<br /><br />The problem with this film is Polanski. This was mostly a standard pot boiler film. There was nothing cutting edge, revolutionary, or evolutionary about the film. The photography and editing were straight melodrama. The only interesting part of the film was his subtle manipulation of the bookends - the first and last five minutes of the film. It is worthwhile to watch the very beginning of the film just after watching the whole film. Polanski has done so many incredible things for film. This film is not one of them.<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13, there is a little strong language, some references to torture, a brief scene of somebody being water boarded, and a brief view of Ewan McGregor's behind as he gets into bed. It seems this film is rated about right and is probably a bit too mature for children under thirteen years old.<br /><br />This was a good movie. If it weren't for the excellent performances by the cast, this would have been a very bad film. I was disappointed with Polanski's effort.13, there is a little strong language, some references to torture, a brief scene of somebody being water boarded, and a brief view of Ewan McGregor's behind as he gets into bed.

0060786523|5.0|Although I appreciate and even treasure many experimental and ultra-modern novels, I must confess there is nothing like reading a long, epic, XIXth Century-style novel, with lots of characters and subplots. This extremely long one, in which action develops between 1951 and 1952 (compare to much longer spans, like in \\"War and Peace\\" or \\"The Magic Mountain\\"), recreates Indian society in the years immediately following Independence and partition between India and Pakistan, a traumatic birth for a huge nation. It recounts the stories of four intricately connected families, one of them from the Muslim aristocracy, and the other three from Hindu upper and upper-middle class. Through this narrative, the author elaborates on different religious, social, economic, and political matters, very much still present in contemporary India. It goes literally and in depth on issues such as the shoe industry, agrarian reform, or burial habits.     The novel has two main threads: the first is the desperate search, by Mrs. Rupa Mehra, widow, of a suitable boy for her daughter Lata. This search enables the author to explore different circles of society, from the said shoe industry to the lives of spoiled heirs or the deep divisions between Hindus and Muslims. The other thread is the creation and approval, in the fictional state of Purva Pradesh, of a Zamindari Law, an agrarian reform that would take away big chunks of land from enormous estates, in order to distribute them among the peasants that had tilled them for many years (there were laws like this at that time). This thread, in particular, portrays the main political debates of the age, focusing on the contentious relationship between two old friends, Mahesh Kapoor, the State's Minister of Revenue (author and proponent of the Zamindari Law), and the Nawab Sahib Khan, Muslim icon and the largest landlord. They are the heads of two of the main families of the novel. Their relationship is further complicated when Kapoor's son (one ofthe possible \\"suitable boys\\") gets involved with one courtisan, the lover of Sahib Khan. There is no point in commenting the particulars of this thread, other than to emphasize that it gives the novel a rich, colorful context which puts in perspective the personal dilemmas of the characters. It gives the story its epic sound.    All those characters, and many more, have to do at several moments with Mrs. Mehra's search for an adequate son in law. The first candidate is Maan Kapoor, an obvious one since his brother is already married to Lata's sister. Actually, the novel starts with that wedding. His downside is that he is a lazy, spoiled playboy. On her own initiative, Lata falls in love, or at least into deep infatuation, with Kabir, a handsome and smart... Muslim. And through Mrs. Mehra's own toils, there appears one Haresh Khanna, likable and exasperating, an egocentrist but efficient technician of the shoe industry, perseverantly looking for a job that matches his ego and allows him to make a good marriage.    There are many other characters, and precisely one of the strongest points of this novel is that none of them is disposable or wasted, for each of them adds a touch of colour and information on the background of this tumultuous era in a diverse country. No chapter is a filler, all of them make a point in a very engaging maner. In fact, Vikram Seth achieves a major feat by keeping the reader's attention not only intact, but growing, through more than 1,400 pages of sustained quality. It is, as I said, a XIXth Century novel, at the same time epic and intimate, serious and funny, panoramic and focused on detail.    Take your time to a long, deep travel around a society with many cultures, food, clothing, music, and colorful habits. Go to wedding parties, attend festivals, be there at moments of violent political unrest, and find out who's going to be the lucky guy who will marry the beautiful, smart, lively and independent Lata Mehra.
B00472SX7E|5.0|Patti's love of her departed friend, warts and all, shines through clear on this memorial that also serves as a window on NYC counter-culture during the late 60's through the mid-70's.  As to be expected, Patti's writing makes this story sparkle with wit and insight.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I purchased a Cordless Swivel Sweeper about 2 years ago. At first, I liked it, because it's light and easy to operate if you have to clean small areas  - like kitchen, every day (it's not good for thorough cleaning). It picked every little dust or crumbs that fall from the table and very easy to clean it - just empty the container in the garbage bin or a bag- so I liked it. After a while I noticed, though I charged the battery, it would only work for a short time and then suddenly stop! Then, it started happenning all the time, it'd work for 10 seconds and then shut off for no reason. I contacted with the manufacturer and they told me that I need to replace the battery, also gave a tip that when I don't use the Sweeper I have to take the battery out, and never to leave battery in the charger once it's charged, and never to recharge until the battery completely runs out of energy. Now I don't know if it's worth buying another battery or not. In total, I used my Swivel Sweeper normally only for a few months out of 2 years that I have it. I might try and get another battery, but I'm worried it won't last long either.
030746363X|5.0|Tim has really gone the extra mile by making himself a guinea pig and measuring/tracking EVERYTHING.  This book is large and covers a bunch of different topics from fat loss, to muscle gain, to sleep, sex, recovery, athletics, and everything in between.  Everything in the book is actionable.  The main warning I have is not to try too many things at once.  Heed Tim's advice and really think about what you are actually likely to incorporate into your lifestyle.

0385342039|3.0|The plot of Twenties Girl is creative and amusing.  At times I wondered who in their right mind would be so rediculous or do such crazy things, but then I remember that Kinsella's characters usually are a little \\"off their rocker.\\" It's a fun, easy read, that will have you chuckling here and there.

1400079144|3.0|The Lost Symbol is the third Dan Brown book about the character Robert Langdon.  Dan Brown books seem to follow a pattern in the Style they are written.  Because of this, if you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code you will probably enjoy The Lost Symbol. The chapters are short making it easy to read the book in small chunks one chapter at a time.  What is lacking is the surprise of the other Robert Langdon stories. Many of the twist and surprises are predictable. The central focus in The Lost Symbol is Washington D.C. and The Masons.  After finishing 1/4 of the book I had already figured out who the villain is and where The Lost Symbol was hidden.  Many of the problems with this book are the same problems the movie versions of the last two Robert Langdon stories and I think that was Dan Brown's intention in order to make the book more movie script friendly. Even though I enjoyed The Lost Symbol, I only gave it three stars because I felt it could have been better if a movie version had not been thought about while writing the book.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I actually give the movie 4 1/2 stars, but the complete package is worth the 5 star rating.  I was not duped into buying the initial DVD release with no special features and am completely satisfied with this collection.  I liked the extended version which added a lot more depth to the story.  First of all, I am not an Avatar-freak: this was my second time watching the movie, I don't aspire to the learn Na'vi language, and the storyline is heavy on \\"Dances with Wolves\\" meets \\"The Matrix\\" meets \\"Dune\\" themes combined with other elements of movies we have all seen before.  The main antagonist, Colonel Quaritch, is a stereotypical, over-the-top narrow-minded soldier character.  Most of the military characters are depicted as heartless, blood-thirsty, and arrogant - I can tell you from experience as a military officer in the Marine Corps that we are not like that.      What makes Avatar really special is the stunning visual environment of Pandora and the symbiotic relationship of the Na'vi with it.  I highly recommend the movie, particularly this collection, for those that have not seen the movie and/or bought the DVD.  James Cameron was robbed at the Academy Awards; while \\"Hurt Locker\\" was an entertaining, yet unrealistic movie, \\"Avatar\\" should have won best picture and best director.  \\"Avatar\\" will be looked at as another landmark in filmmaking for its amazing visuals and attention to detail.  Its themes touch the viewer and what is there not to like?  Good movie!!
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I really wish the subject matter had been taken more seriously. It could have been a great film. Effects were terrific though.
0767836324|5.0|This movie is a mix of some really awful stuff, some mediocre, and some... just enchanting. My only complaints are the crude humour (which is never good taste), and Julia Roberts, who makes about the worst Tinkerbell I've ever seen. Of course, the \\"politically correct\\" Lost Boys were somewhat annoying, but I can overlook that part. The special effects weren't spectacular, but were passable.    What really makes this movie shine is the talents of Robin Williams, Maggie Smith, and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is a brilliant (though ridiculous - in a good way) Hook. Maggie Smith IS Wendy - though she's grown up. And Robin Williams? Well... let's just say that if Peter Pan grew up and became a \\"cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success, and runs and hides from his wife and children\\", well here he is.      I think the problem with this movie is, as another reviewer said, there simply aren't enough people who know the book/play/etc. I found myself grinning as scene after scene contains reference after reference to the true Peter Pan story; having watched the Disney version simply isn't enough. The second problem is that it seems that many reviewers think this movie's supposed to be Peter Pan. It's not. It is, in fact, merely a supposition: what if Peter Pan DID grow up? What if Hood didn't REALLY die? And what if the adult Peter Pan didn't even know who he was?    This movie is tons of fun. Again stealing from another reviewer, what makes Robin William's acting so wonderful isn't his role as the crabby, workaholic dad, or even his amazing role as a very Peter Pann-ish Peter. It's his believable transformation. There's no hokey moment of, \\"Hey, I really am Peter Pan! Ok, kids, let's go get Hook!\\" Instead, he slowly (almost reluctantly) leaves behind Peter Banning and becomes who he once was.     One of my favorite moments of the film was when Banning/Pan remembers how to fly. There was just something wonderful about a man re -discovering a world he had been absent from for 30+ years. Think of that! Remembering how to fly after thirty years. And finding it just as exhilarating as ever...
0525423273|5.0|If you're craving a heartfelt contemporary YA romance with splendid character development, you absolutely must check out Stephanie Perkins' debut novel. Set against the wondrous backdrop of Parisian city life, ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is nevertheless a thoroughly down-to-earth book with a realistic romance guaranteed to warm the core of your very being.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant is far from pleased that her successful writer father has sent her to a school in Paris for her senior year of high school. She had been counting on spending as much time with her best friend and working on developing a possible romance between her and her crush. Instead, Anna now has to deal with a whole new language, a new city, and a new set of classmates.<br /><br />Luckily, Anna quickly makes some good friends, including Etienne St. Clair, a charming, good-looking, and genuinely nice boy with a British accent, family troubles, and a gorgeous girlfriend. Anna and St. Clair hit it off immediately, but are they meant to be something more, when there seem to be so many obstacles against them?<br /><br />Anna and St. Clair's relationship is nearly unmatched in terms of realistic development. Anna does initially acknowledge St. Clair's looks--but he turns out to be so much more than just a pretty face. If you like nice guys, then St. Clair is your man. He's friendly, sensitive, and loyal, exactly the kind of guy that every girl should have. As Anna and St. Clair gradually become friends and then perhaps something more, readers will no doubt be able to relate to the alternating giddiness and tensions that are all part of a budding romance.<br /><br />If St. Clair is the perfect nice guy, then Anna feels a bit like the everygirl. She's believably uncertain when circumstances call for it, yet she is also not entirely a social pariah and is able to make friends. I would've liked a bit more exploration of Anna and St. Clair's family troubles, but it hardly deterred from my enjoyment of their story. Stephanie Perkins also makes great use of the story's setting: Anna and St. Clair wander Paris with the fascination and familiarity that a foreign student in an amazing city would feel.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins has written a wonderful contemporary YA novel that will no doubt work its way into many readers' hearts.

After being extremely anxious for a few days I received my book and started reading right away. This was yet another book I was unable to put down.  Like the fist book this one was a non stop read for me. Even though it's geared toward the \\"teenage\\" crowd I feel it's a good read for adults as well (I am 29).  I highly recommend reading the whole series, just make sure you have all 3 when you get started!
B003AWRMCE|4.0|Like a lot of Clint Eastwood flicks, this one doesn't seem nearly as good almost 20 years after its release. Times were simpler back in 1992 when this won four Academy Awards, I guess. Today, it seems just okay, not the 'masterpiece' it was hailed as. I thought they said the same thing for \\"Flag of Our Fathers,\\" or was that \\"Pretty Baby\\"? No, wait, the Dirty Harry series? Please. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the brutal sheriff trying to keep his town gun-free. Morgan Freeman plays his gentle and wise buddy role, yet again. The kid who recruits those two is awful, and has never been heard from again, as far as I know. Richard Harris is kind of wasted as Bob, a killer who gets whomped along the way. The script was supposed to be some mumbo-jumbo about the futility of violence. Whatever. The writing isn't bad, but I would not call it classic. Eastwood delivers his trademark sneers and squints, but although he is portrayed as a retired killer turned gentle hog farmer, no one will be surprised when he returns to action during the final third of the film. Still entertaining, this one. Just don't get too worshipful.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Better than House, Chuck, Castle, Bones, and any other 1 hour drama on network television.  The only shows I have liked more in the past 10 years were Firefly and Lost.  The show really started to hit its stride in the back half of last year and it is the only show that I can't let stack up on my DVR.  They did a great job of casting Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, and the real star of the show...John Noble.  That guy is awesome.      I will say that to truly enjoy this season you need to have more backstory.  You probably need to at least watch the back half of season 2 to appreciate season 3.  So, kill two birds with one stone and buy the seasons of fringe for a Christmas present for someone and then offer to host a marathon watching party with them.

How wonderful to have this wonderful collaboration between the brilliant composer, Higdon, and her friend, Hilary Hahn.  Here is exciting music.  One can almost hear the friendship between these two musicians as one listens to the Higdon concerto.  I have personally met both the violinist and the composer and I am happy to report they are both pleasant and humble purveyors of their excellent skills.
B0000630BT|5.0|To start with is just to say that if you do not have this album or have never listened to this album than you are really young (meaning younger than 10 years old, born in 2000) or you have no clue about heavy metal. Judas Priest have been the pioneers on NWOBHM, which resulted in bands like metallica, anthrax, slayer, megadeth, and all the death and thrash metal bands, and then later the grunge metal.  This album starts with a great opener \\"Pain killer\\"- which describes the lifestyle rob lived when he was hooked on drugs (pills). the album goes on with classical heavy metal. So if you do not have this album, by all means YOU MUST HAVE IT.  LONG LIVE HALFORD!!!!!!!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|It was a great purchase. It's very simple to put on. It's durable and simply does what it is supposed to do. It feels natural and unless you specifically point it out no one will notice and they will assume that the controller was already built like that. I do enjoy having the option to take them off for certain games like GT5 and High Velocity Bowling. So simply put I like the PS3 controller the way it is and I also like having the ability to change it to suit my preference and this attachment gives me that ability without any headaches.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I have to go against the majority here as I found this to be boring, slow and also not thought out.I could not waste my time watching all of it so my viewing was limited.I need something to get my attention in the first half hour or I will not watch the rest anymore.I have wasted too much time thinking that they will get better.If this does well maybe I will watch again if I cannot find something else to do.If this little girl vampire has been around for so very long I would think she would be smarter about what she does,also her servant.I would find someone with a little more brains.If this was real she would not of lasted very long,which to me makes this a dumb movie.   I just cannot handle anymore movies where the makers think that none of us can use our heads.  Now if it does get better (which I doubt)then I apologise for this and I hope you are not offended.Just my opinion.Which I should not have to but some people on here are thin skinned.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This movie is an action packed adventure with a sub plot of murder.  The survivors of a plane crash have to battle the elements and a man eating bear.

0307592839|4.0|I loved a lot of things about Egan's new book, especially the mosaic structure and the nostalgia that permeates the book.  But Egan's a much more convincing historian than futurist,  and the portions of the book set in c. 2020 didn't hold up to the rest for me.  I was especially annoyed and perplexed by the PowerPoint, which seemed to be more a relic from the past than a vision of the future.  Don't get me wrong -- it wasn't the concept but the execution that failed for me.<br /><br />The PowerPoint is supposedly a teenager's homework project in 2020, but it looked more like a current-day middle-aged, middle manager's vision of how to use the medium than any contemporary teenager's.  My fifteen-year-old daughter has been doing her homework on PowerPoint since the third grade, as have all of her classmates.  The presentations of these contemporary kids are layered collages of words, images, and animations.  The images are heavily manipulated mash-ups created with Photoshop and the latest morphing software, and the animations are laden with inside jokes.  These presentations reflect a different way of THINKING than the static, image-free, logically constructed slides in Egan's supposedly futuristic vision.<br /><br />So is it worth spending a whole review on this one aspect of the book?  I think it is, because the PowerPoint was in some ways the most daring part of the book and indeed its climax.  That and the concluding chapter were big disappointments to me; I wish I had replaced them with a couple of chapters ripped from Gary Shteyngart's new book instead.  Now there's a guy with a convincing vision of the future.<br /><br />Do you agree with me?  Let me know in the comments.
031603438X|3.0|Well, this book is certainly long enough, but what we have here is essentially a (very, very) long magazine interview.  It doesn't feel like Keith actually 'wrote' the book, and perhaps that's a good thing because it is very representational of the Keith we've come to know over the years.  Brilliant, unique, committed and sometimes plain old mean with a huge dose of false bravado.  Like any man, I doubt Ronnie Wood takes a punch from anyone unless he's smart enough to know what side his bread is buttered on.<br /><br />This book will have historical importance long after Keith is gone.  Keith dollops up the lonesome, honest gunslinger image here very generously.  But future readers who scratch under the surface of superstar image will still have a lot of digging to do.  Why do Bobby Keys or Freddy Sessler rate more pulp than Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman combined?  It could be Mick T and Bill just aren't very interesting human beings and contributed little to the Rolling Stones success or Keith's life in particular.  But it also could be that Mick T and Bill didn't tow the party line--a line which Keith clearly has a superior financial interest.<br /><br />In the end, this is a good read for the casual fan, an essential one for the rabid fan and a near pass for the historian.  As far as a celebrity (auto)bio goes, it boils water.  Just barely.
B00447G2T8|5.0|Worrds cannot describe this album. The only thing that I could say is that this album \\"IS METAL\\" for sure. \\"ARE YOU METAL?\\" stands out alone beside \\"IF MOUNTAINS COULD TALK\\". If you are an HELLOWEEN fan, you must have this album in your collection. Andi's voice is awesome, his tone changes from high to very deep voice. He is always impressing when he sings. I think that Andi brought this band further that Kinske would. Beside that, i believe Kiske id better in his solo project \\"KINSKE/SOMMERVILLE\\" which it is a superb album. But Are You Metal? it is awesome and you should buy it if you are Helooween fan. ENJOY!!!!!!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Ordered from Amazon on 12/10/10.  The version that arrived is the remastered one.  Basically, it's awesome if you get this version.  Yes, the colors are a bit amped up over the prior release, but the EE and DNR are gone and it looks amazing. This has been one of  my favorite movies since it came out and I am very happy with the quality of this remastered version.  Tons of special features as well.  Highly recommended upgrade if you own the regular DVD.
0439023513|5.0|Great ending to The Hunger Games trilogy and definitely keeps you on the edge until the very end.    I saw so many paralells in these books to our lives today to what the characters go through.  It really made me think about the freedoms we give up today to feel safer.

B00000JPYD|5.0|Bridge Of Sighs (1974) is Robin Trower's best album, and don't let anybody tell you it's not.  Such rockin' blues songs as Day Of The Eagle, Bridge Of Sighs, In This Place, Little Bit Of Sympathy, Lady Love, etc. have stood the test of time.  Trower is one of the great blues rock guitarists ever.  Favorite tracks of mine are Bridge Of Sighs, In This Place (great sound effects added), and Day Of The Eagle.  This album also contains five live tracks from this album.<br /><br />This album rocks.  Get it.
B003XD7ECI|4.0|THIS ALBUM HAS A LOT IN COMMON WITH THE STYLE OF \\"FUTURE WORLD\\" FROM \\"KEEPER....I\\", IT'S JUST THIS ONE HAS LOVE SONGS AND INVOLVES A WOMAN SINGER. AT SOME POINT IN SOME SONGS YOU COULD SEE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THIS ALBUM AND THE BAND NIGHTWISH, WHICH ALSO HAS A WOMAN VOCALIST. BUT OVERALL, THE BAND DOES HAVE SOME GOOD RIFFS, AND KISKE'S VOICE DOES COLLIDE GOOD WITH SOMMERVILLE'S. THIS IS A MIS TEMPO HARD ROCK, AND I WOULD NOT CALL IT HEAVY METAL. BUT THE RIFFS AND VOCALS ARE GREAT, SO I GIVE THEM A FOUR STAR WHICH IS WELL ACCOMPLISHED. IF YOU LIKE PREVIOUS KISKE PROJECTS, I WOULD DEFINETELY BUY THIS ONE. BUT DO NOT EXPECT SPEED METAL, IT IS JUST HARD ROCK WITH GOOD RIFFS AND GREAT VOCALS. GOOD HARD ROCK-LOVE ALBUM!!!!
B003Y8YXGM|2.0|Hey, I think Lennon was brilliant, but let's face it - of his solo records, only Plastic Ono Band and Imagine are classics. Hate to say it, but the critics were right this time. I thought this and Mind Games were great when I was 12, but now in my mid-forties ... not so much. This stuff is simply boring. Five-star? No way.
0307387178|5.0|I thought this would be a happy go lucky adventure story and boy was I wrong.  I lived in Alaska for several years as a child and the portrait the author paints of the scenery was like going back in time.    Wondefully written.

B0001I561E|2.0|This is a Christmas gift, i bought it \\"NEW\\" or so i thought.  The front cover is scanned or photocopied. There is no new purchase sticker over the top of the dvd case.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|Let me start by telling you a few things--I have not heard their debut CD, only their Christmas and this one, and the song that got me hooked on Lady Antebellum is American Honey.    I'm going to do it like a previous reviewer did, only slightly different:    Need You Now: 9/10. I love this song, Hillary and Charles sing phenomenally together. They sing about lovers who got into a fight and realize that they really need each other through it all. It's amazing.    Our Kind of Love: 10/10. It's one of the best songs. It's uplifting, with the instruments, singing, and lyrics. It seems to be about new lovers who just realized that they truly love each other and what it means to them.    American Honey: 10/10. I love this song; this is the one that got me hooked. Hillary leads the song, telling about how she wants to go back to the slow life she had before singing/performing. 'There's a wild, wild whisper blowing in the wind, calling out my name like a long lost friend...' It makes me remember things from when I was younger.    Hello World: 9/10. Charles is an amazing singer. I used to not be able to listen to this song, it almost made me cry. He sings about realizing that he needs to be with his family in their time of need. It is very inspirational...    Perfect Day: 8/10. Hillary sings about an amazing day, and never wanting to leave it. It is an upbeat song, a great one to listen to after the sad track before it, 'Hello World'. She sounds really good in this one.    Love This Pain: 9/10. He doesn't want her to call him anymore, but he wants her to stay. It's about a confusing ruckus between lovers. As always, Charles sings very well.    When You Got A Good Thing: 11/10. Hillary and Charles do the best duets. 'When the ground starts shaking, you gotta know when you got a good thing'. The best song on the CD. It's about staying true to your relationship, because you never know what's going to happen, and if something horrible DOES happen, you 'gotta know when you gottagood thing.'    Stars Tonight: 7/10. It's a very joyful song about performing. The lyrics are great, but there's something about it that doesn't click as well as the others.    If I Knew Then: ?/10. I've only heard a few seconds of the song, it almost made me cry, so I can't really judge it.    Something 'Bout A Woman: 9/10. Another uplifting song about a boy wanting a girl. I'm a woman, so I can't really relate as well.    Ready To Love Again: 10/10. The last track ends it perfectly, Hillary inspires all broken-hearted women and men that they can still love, and you don't have to fear breaking up with someone.      Lady Antebellum is a great band, I hope they achieve a lot in the music industry.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|An excellent miniseries using people that once lived in those days.  The war is shown brutal and bloody. War can take off an arm or leg or blow you to bits. Patriotism was strong in those days and you can see the effort the American people has given in the war. But also you can see that the Japanese soldier is human but strongly disciplined, stout and tenacious and ready to give their lives for the Emperor. Like the movies, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\", \\"The Pacific\\" for me ranks #1 Years before I wondered and wished that someday the movie industry would produce a war movie of the Pacific....How I wished it would come.....and my wish came true.
0439023491|5.0|I couldn't wait to read Catching Fire once I had finished The Hunger Games.  The sequel is every bit as great as the first book and leaves you dying to know what is coming next.  Throughout the book I liked Katniss more and more at every turn and ached for the life changing decisions she had to make.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I was shocked at how many people gave this film 1 star. It is true that Inception is incredibly ambitious due to its idea within an idea... within an idea. However, I believe that is what makes it great. It's continuous. The film took 10 years to complete from start to finish, and think that it is a bit unfair to say Christopher Nolan's Inception was, \\"ridiculous, confused, and adolescent.\\" I really enjoyed the film, and think that it is a breath of fresh air. The Cinematography was beautiful, the story is new and interesting, the acting is on point, and the soundtrack is exciting. It may not be for everyone sure, but it is well worth an honorable mention.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I came into Series 5 not sure what to expect.  My favourite of Doctor of the new series was leaving, but so was my least favourite companion.    Matt Smith starts off kind of shaky as a completely discombobulated Doctor, but he eventually settles into the role.  Karen Gillan, on the other hand, is brilliant all the way through.  She may actually top Freema Agyeman as my new favourite companion.    This series is a little slim on extras.  There are a couple \\"Meanwhile in the TARDIS\\" deleted scenes, 5 'In-Vision Commentaries', and Monster Files on the Daleks, Weeping Angels, Silurians, and The Alliance.  Now, to be fair, I haven't gone all the way through Disc 6 yet, which is the Doctor Who Confidential episodes.    Still, all in all, it's definitely worth picking up for any fan of the new series.

B00356CO1E|4.0|So we popped in the tape on Sunday afternoon and after about 10 minutes, I felt like I was going to hurl.  I am so out of shape I can't believe it.  But I don't want to quit, so I'll be doing a little less today and then trying harder each day.  I started out strong, but just a little too strong I guess.  I can't wait to see how this works.  And my husband is doing it with me, which is even better--but I can't look at him while I'm exercising--he makes me laugh.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|Gasland is much less heavy-handed as an expose than documentaries by Micheal Moore, but the effect of this movie was still frightening...the scariest parts were where it becomes obvious that regulation is so hodge-podge, that politicians are so wary of challenging gas industry interests, and most frightening of all, how incredibly (perilously?) connected the waterways of the continent actually are.  Not one person can say \\"oh well, it's not happening in my back yard.\\" A truly excellent film.
030746363X|1.0|Downloaded this book on kindle a couple of days ago.  Actually, thought it looked good with the sample that I read.  But once I got into it, I thought this guy was crazy.  Read the first few reviews, and ask yourself, if you would really do this stuff.  I think the book is about how wonderful and smart Tim thinks he is.  Hey, knock yourself out and take an ice bath.  Me, I got my money back.

030746363X|4.0|So, the only reason I read this book is because my boyfriend is a Tim Ferriss fan and also I really wanted to read what he wrote about the 15 minute orgasm.<br /><br />Firstly, I think the book isn't bad. It's written a little erratically I feel, like Tim's running about jabbing himself, stuffing his face while jotting down the results and writing the book at the same time. A little like Tim on speed. But hey, I'm not a big reader of his blog, maybe he always writes this way.<br /><br />That said, I really like the concept - the least amount of action/work for the best results. And for that I think the book is the best. It's for all the lazy mofos out there who always wondered, there's gotta be a better way to do this, but weren't OCD enough to actually figure it out - Thank you Tim Ferriss!<br /><br />Read the other reviews on the mechanics of the diet and training and all that, but I want to focus on the 15 minute orgasm claim. I've read some reviewers disapproving that claim. Even saying that Tim must find girls who are not comfortable or do not know their bodies for that to work.<br /><br />Well, ahem, I might have believed them had I not had the pleasure of having this technique demonstrated on me (not by Tim obviously). It's called the 'Stroking Technique'. And yes, it can get very clinical but hot damn it gives you one helluvan extended orgasm. I think what Tim fails to write about in the book (being all biznaz and scientify about it) is that the girl obviously needs to be relaxed and trusts the guy OR be reaallly comfortable in her body that she doesn't mind going spread eagle while a guy clinically strokes her. This isn't a \\"let's get hot and heavy and i will miraculously with the power of my man mojo give you a 15 minute orgasm\\" move. This is a move you have to really practice to get right and for the most part will involve you stroking the girl and watch her getting ENORMOUS amounts of pleasure from it.<br /><br />Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is, if you're a guy and you think that the 15 minute orgasm is going to come from you performing some special sexy time move thus putting you on top of the shagging game, you're wrong. And you're going to be disappointed. And girls, don't discount this, once done to you right, it's the best effing thing and you'll be begging for it! People pay a lot of money to learn this technique (they actually take classes for it) and Tim is giving it away for 13 bucks lol! Good deal.15 minute orgasm is going to come from you performing some special sexy time move thus putting you on top of the shagging game, you're wrong. And you're going to be disappointed.

B002ZG981E|1.0|I was really excited about this movie because I had just finished watching Shutter Island in which I loved! However, I couldn't even give this a full run. I was lost in the first half hour, not lost that I didn't know what was happening, It just couldn't hold my attention. I began reading a book, which you can't do while watching this movie. Finally, about 45 minutes into the movie, I just turned it off. This was rediculous. Worst movie I've tried to watch in a long time. I'd rather watch SpongeBob with my kids!!!!
B002ZG9968|4.0|I found this movie to be so funny, especially the birthing scene of one of the single mothers.  I have watched it over and over again.  Loved it.
0061433047|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 11-year-old daughter reads, I am fairly familiar with the works of Diana Wynne Jones, Angie Sage and Kaye Umansky (a truly versatile writer in terms of style) - and I love them. I am also a fan of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (although not a rabid fan) and more masculine style - but in \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\", I found the perfect blending. I had feared that Pratchett's writings were a bit more adult than I wanted said daughter exposed to for the moment, but, happily, this was not the case. The more mature comic parts of the book simply slid right over said daughter's head while they had me in stitches - and the voice of Tiffany Aching spoke clearly throughout the book. I had to look at the cover to remember it was written by a man! Of course, knowing that Pratchett has been ill with early-onset Alzheimer's for these last few years now just makes reading this book more poignant. The book was a terrific read, and, to my surprise, said daughter actually proclaimed it her very favourite book ever, even more so than Harry Potter - so I would say that it's a good introduction to the Discworld books. In the words of said daughter:    \\"The book, 'I Shall Wear Midnight' by Terry Pratchett is a simply bewitching read.    \\"16-year-old Tiffany Aching has spent years studying with senior witches, and now she is on her own. As the witch of the Chalk, she does not do the sparkly, interesting types of magic. Instead, she helps the needy, from cutting old lady's toenails to saving a daughter and her baby from a father with a whip and a furious temper. However, when people begin to turn against witches, Tiffany, along with the Wee Free Man, a knight, a new baron, the baron's fiancé and all the witches in Discworld, must catch the person or thing responsible ...    \\"My favorite characters were, besides Tiffany and Preston, the Wee Free Men, because they are so little and blue, and very energetic.    \\"I would recommend this book to everyonewho enjoys sorcery, magic and witchcraft of all kinds. I would also give this book 25 gold stars: five for the characters; five for the cover and title; five for the plot; five for the humor and five for the ending.\\"

B003EYVY0E|3.0|I have been doing some research on this, and while i am also very upset that the extended editions were not included, Warner tried. Both the directors of the 3rd and 4th movies were given opportunites to make extended editions for the sets, but unlike Chris Columbus, they said that the films they originally made were their directors cuts and they did not want to add anymore scenes to their films. Warner respected their wishes and did not add any of the scenes back in. So please if you are going to blame anyone, blame the directors.  Warner tried. Lets just hope David Yates gives us some good stuff for the 5th, 6th, and 7th films.

0060922583|5.0|This book is interesting from the standpoint of viewing a virtually sci-fi idea move into the realm of real science.  Let me send out a caution to readers whom are scientific minded folks: This book is written by a journalist, albeit a very informed journalist, therefore, you should not anticipate sound scientific propositions.  What you should expect is a narrative account of the development of an idea that has a great deal of scientific data to back it up.  Although the data does not present a coherent, unified picture in itself, the author attempts to put the pieces together, and he does so in a well-written fashion.<br /><br />I make the comment about an idea going from sci-fi to science, because the idea of a holographic universe has been migrating toward the forefront of fields of science, such as cosmology.  Such physicists as Susskind and Hawking discuss information theory, as it pertains to information contained space, which was set into motion by inquiries into thermodynamics of blackholes.  On top of this, the universe as information has become an interesting topic in areas such as mathematics (cybernetics, etc.) and philosophy (Langan, Sheldrake, Wheeler, etc, and the conscious universe).<br /><br />In my mind, there is no doubt that Talbot was knee deep into the study of the scientific papers he had to read in order to write this book.  His thoughts are so well thought out and so well reasoned that I don't think much can be improved upon.<br /><br />Most of all, I found this book to be a fun excursion, yet more fulfilling than most works of fiction.
B00049QQHI|5.0|This movie remains among the best I have ever seen. Everything about it is as good as it gets. Before it is over you know that every single camera angle, every casting selection, every song used, and every location was somehow, perfect. Yet it doesn't come off as a polished Hollywood high budget film. The story and characters are presented in a believable way that makes your heart bleed even when they screw up, because they are that real. The real Jim becomes irrelevant. There are a million Jims. DiCaprio dug deep for this one, and so did his co-stars. I give a lot of credit to Director Kalvert and can't believe that he is a one-hit-wonder. This movie makes me want more from the man. Two scenes that were most incredible are when Jim's mom chains the door locking him out. Only his arm and face are visible through the gap allowed by the security chain. It doesn't take an addict to feel his pain. And at the same time, Lorraine Bracco is on the other side of the door and you know how bad it hurts her. Both put forth a superb performance throughout the movie, but this is where they shine. One must see it to believe it. The other scene is when DiCaprio, as Jim, is in Reggie's house alone having just come clean the day before. His demons return and the camera work in this short but important scene is magic. DiCaprio remains stationary while the camera spins. Each time the camera pans past him his state of agitation is increased. It was a great way to portray something that could otherwise have been a long drawn out boring sequence. Watch it, you won't be disseminated.
B001AQO400|5.0|So glad to see it finally on Blu-ray... I was worried it wasn't going to be produced on Blu-ray after a quick release on HD-DVD.<br /><br />I cannot explain to you why this is my favorite movie... but I'll try. The whole movie is very artistic; the kind of movie you can watch in the dark really loud by yourself and experience it a different way every time you immerse yourself in it. The film has a melancholy charm and humor to it that really resonates with me. I just love the movie.

1400082773|3.0|I am about 90% finished reading this book.  I am reading it as a result of reading the book \\"The Roots of Obama's Rage\\", which referenced this book so often, that I wanted to read it myself, just to see if I agreed with the conclusion that the TRoO'sR author had so carefully outlined.  Which basically is that B. Obama, often accused of being a far-leftwing socialist, is in reality not so much a socialist as a closet anti-colonialist, an ideology that he adopted as the result of his 1988 trip to Africa, back to his roots, where he became obsessed with his late father's memory and took up the latter's great cause.  So far, in reading this book, I have not arrived at that conclusion, but like I said, I'm not quite finished reading it.  I may change my mind later.  It's definitely an interesting perspective on the mind of a sitting President of the United States, at the very least.    The various lessons I've learned, supposedly from Obama, so far are as follows:    ~~Everything in Obama's world is, or were at the time this book was written, defined strictly in terms of black and white; as in all his friends, family, and associate's minds, thoughts, conversations, and actions.  I had no idea before reading this book that black people were so preoccupied with white people.  I was raised in the deep South.  I never once in my lifetime remember my parents or my friends sitting around discussing the pros and cons of blacks.  Never.  My parents, in the small town environment in which I was raised, discussed who was ill, who had died, who was getting married, maybe spiced up a bit with a little local gossip every now and then.  In college, my friends and I discussed grades, classes, who was dating who, where we were going the upcoming weekend, etc., again maybe spiced with a little gossip.  But it seems that all everyone Obama has associated himself with ever thought about or discussed was \\"whitey\\", almost always in angry or derogatory terms.  Needless to say, ever the politician even then, he is always on the fence in his literary mindset, not quite agreeing, but not quite disagreeing either.        ~~I think this book is one huge embellishment, and largely a work of fiction of Obama's life as he romanticized it to be.  It is almost inconceivable that at the age of 34, when he supposedly wrote this book, he could remember an exact conversation he had at the age of 8 or a detailed description of the exact color and type of material some obscure woman's headscarf was made of (how many 20-something men know or even notice that kind of thing?), or the recurring theme of dreams he had.  Not the usual chaotic dreams that the normal person has, the ones that don't make sense and that we can barely piece together after we wake up.  But ones that he remembers years later that are logical and detailed and somewhat sensible. And so on and so forth.....the detail and articulation from early childhood on is almost mind-boggling.    ~~I don't think Obama actually wrote this book.  Which is no big crime as many folks have \\"ghost\\" writers; however, most politicians acknowledge this fact at some point and I don't think Obama ever has.  The book is overwhelmingly burdened with long flowery phrases, political idioms, and descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and phrases that I would imagine only a polished journalist could pull from his stockpile of years of writing experience.  I guess I started suspecting this after about the first chapter, and became more and more convinced of it the more I read.  Finally, after about Chapter 17, I \\"googled\\" the subject, and it seems that there are those more knowledgeable than I am that have written extensively on the subject.  Again, it's not a crime, but it would be interesting to know who truly wrote the book, especially in reference to all the social and political implications the book's theme (so far) relays.  But then, there seems to be a whole lot about Obama's life that we, the public, have not been given verifiable access to.    ~~From what I've read so far, I have not drawn the conclusion that Obama Sr. was either a great man nor a true-blue anti-colonialist.  The conclusion that I have drawn, based on Obama's own sibling's characterization of their father, the \\"Old Man\\", was that he was a very intelligent man; maybe too intelligent for his own good.  And as a result, very much a text-book narcissist who, through his own arrogance and pushiness, made a lot of enemies in the newly formed Kenyan government of which he was a part, and thus set in motion his own downfall.  And due to the resulting sour-grapes, conveniently became an anti-colonialist and an abusive alcoholic.  I don't know yet, since I've not finished the book, what impression Obama Jr. leaves the African continent with in regard to the \\"Old Man\\", a husband and father who abandoned not one, but 3 or 4 families and that only bothered to see Obama Jr. once in his life.  It should prove interesting.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|I've seen many reviews about this Blu-ray disc, and they say it's a big disappointment when compared to the first Home Alone Blu-ray. Well, I'll be the judge of that (of course, it's my review). Does this Blu-ray look as good as Home Alone? Nope, but it still looks very good on an HDTV. If you stand 1-2 feet from the screen, you will see a lot of grain though, but if you stay at a normal seating distance, it looks great. I compared it to the previous DVD version I have, and there is no comparison. There are simple things you can see now that you could not before like: the note given to Kevin, clear Christmas lights, and the text when Kevin uses his Dad's Visa Card. The old DVD version could not be played properly on widescreen TVs since it wasn't enhanced while the Blu-ray version is 1080p which makes a HUGE difference. The DVD version suffered with Dolby Surround 2.0 while we get DTS-HD sound on the Blu-Ray. There are no extras, but it's a good thing since this was a single layer-disc which allowed for a higher data rate on the picture quality. So, if you're wanting to get the best version of Home Alone 2 or upgrade to a better version, than this Blu-Ray version is it.
1439107955|5.0|just an incredible history of the most deadly disease our race has faced.  Well worth the read for those who have family and friends with cancer, or are curious about this insidious monster.
1599218011|5.0|I had high hopes for this book, and WOW did it deliver!!      Although I've never met her, Kris Carr has been an inspiration to me ever since her film, Crazy Sexy Cancer came out years ago.  Her story is similar to mine in that I was also diagnosed with cancer at 31.  Like Kris, I was told that it was incurable but slow growing (thankfully, it is treatable when the time comes).  Unlike Kris, however, I let my diagnosis send me into depression and actually developed worse habits than I had before.  But learning about Kris' story and reading her books have finally inspired me to turn things around.  There's so much information out there and I find myself constantly looking to Kris' wisdom to help me sort it all out.  Needless to say, I was expecting a lot from Crazy Sexy Diet.  Even though I had already learned a little bit about many of the topics covered in the book, I was still finding it REALLY overwhelming to try and understand all of the information out there and how to implement it in everyday (busy) life.    Kris to the rescue!!  This book is full of lots of information AND lots of great practical tips to get started.  I have read a lot of health and diet books, but there isn't another one out there that holds a candle to Crazy Sexy Diet.  It's fun to read and makes the journey to health seem so doable.  Not easy, but doable.  Best of all, Kris' style doesn't force any particular idea - she puts it all out there so that each of us can make our own decision about what will work best in our own lives.  Every page of this book not only motivated me to do something, but made it clear that I can - I just have to make the decision to get started.      And so I will.  21-Day Cleanse, here I come!  I'm looking forward to it not just because I think it will be good for me (I know it will), but because with Kris' wisdom and encouragement on every page, I know I CAN do it.  And that's huge.

B00005JKTF|5.0|The movie Charlotte Grey provided a good snapshot of women spies of the SOE dropped into France during WW II.  The life span for these women averaged less than 6 months if they were lucky.  The work was very dangerous, and it was impossible to know who could be trusted.  If you trusted the wrong person, you ended up tortured and executed by the Gestopo.  These women spies were something new for the British and their participation was resented by the upper chain of command.  However, they were very successful.  This movie also provides a good example of life during this time period.  WW II brought about many changes for women.  Dangerous work as a spy, was one of the most significant.  This movie is well worth your time and money.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Easily the best movie I saw all year, revelatory performances by Affleck, Lively, Renner and Hamm...great direction, perfectly paced, phenomenal dialogue.
0385523386|5.0|minor spoilers    Five stars as this was one of those rare books I found hard to put down. That's quite an achievement on the author's part as I find Jane Austen novels tedious, and would have thought to have been terminally bored by a book that's mostly about relationships within a group of women.    It's easy to find accounts of torture and murder of inmates by the State in horrific United States prisons - just check out Amnesty International's website. I'm sure you can also find lurid tales of sex starved female prisoners in shady corners of the internet. Piper's account, however, is of neither. She endures a relatively brief stay in a place that's probably benign by US standards. She only experiences some of the true brutality of the United States prison system mercifully close to her release date, and although she does refer sparingly to prison sex, her only sexual experiences are when she is groped by some of the male guards.     Understandably nervous at first, she soon finds friends among her fellow inmates, who are not the psychopaths that she might have feared. The book's main theme is the triumph of decent humanity over adversity, as the prisoners create some sort of life for themselves with virtually no resources. A yoga class is formed, Piper logs more miles each day on a running track than most free people ever manage, and numerous petty rules are broken as the inmates devise ways to whip up more interesting meals. Elaborate decorations are fashioned from practically nothing for Christmas and Halloween. Most of the prisoners seem to be far worthier people than their jailers.    A secondary theme is the prison administration's total indifference to the welfare of its charges. Little if any intellectual stimulation is provided, and the guards range from OK but lazy to nasty but not vicious. This neglect was sometimes amusing. In one of a series of useless talks supposedly designed to prepare inmates due for release for life outside, the lecture on housing was delivered by a nice but hapless man who discussed aluminium cladding and the best kind of roof for a house. Well, I suppose that was his area of expertise.    Piper seems to be remarkably unembittered from an experience that would have left me seething with rage. The only time she is really upset is when the State forbids her visiting her dying grandmother, but she doesn't seem to hold much of a grudge even for that. She's fortunate not to have any children, but describes the trauma inflicted on young children of prisoners who are deprived of their mother's care.    It's true that things were far easier for Piper than for the other prisoners. She only had to serve a relatively short sentence, had books and magazines showered on her by many wonderfully supportive friends, and had a new apartment to share with her future husband to look forward to on release. This only goes to show, however, just how bad things were for just about everyone else, most of who would almost certainly have fallen foul of the insane drug laws of the United States rather than committing any real crime.    I know that I should be far more angry about Amnesty International's reports on US prisons, but those things are so far beyond everyday experience that they're hard to imagine. By its very ordinary nature, Piper's account is far easier to experience vicariously.    A top book by a talented writer
B003VDZWAQ|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from a Syfy show but I was very pleasantly surprised with this.  The underlying \\"theme\\" is intriguing and I especially like the young woman that stars.  She's given snappy, believable and witty dialog, she's a very likable character and the story arc is pretty fascinating.  Not to mention the scenery is fantastic!  I really enjoyed this and I'm REALLY looking forward to the second season after that awesome series finale.  ETA:  this review was for the entire first season although I thought the pilot episode was good as well.

B0037KMHRY|2.0|I am not a huge fan of Tron but when I heard that Daft Punk was doing the album I was psyched.  Ended up buying the album without previewing it since everything else from Daft Punk was awesome.  Unfortunately, aside from being told the music was created by Daft Punk, there are few elements in the actual score that would corroborate that.  As a movie score it is on par with most of the things that I heard.  Most of the tracks are slow orchestral pieces that I feel need to be enjoyed with some sort of visual stimulation as the music isn't as rich as most orchestral pieces. Most of the songs don't have a base track and if you are sleepy may just put you out.    Just a word of warning to the people buying it because it is a Daft Punk album.  Make sure that you check out the tracks first before buying to make sure that the style is something that you are into.
B003ZSI9YI|3.0|This deluxe version wasn't exactly what I expected. I had ordered the standard version along with it and the quality of the CD, box and images was quite inferior to the standard one. The extra tracks are ok but not worth buying the deluxe version for.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|The Town is blessed with great acting and a suspenseful, engrossing plot.  The title refers to the Charlestown neighborhood in Boston.  In the first minutes of the film we learn that this neighborhood has produced more bank robbers than any other  place in the US.  This film is about one of these robbers, Doug Macray, who is a mastermind of clever bank heists, and who, after falling in love with a former hostage, wants out.  The movie's strength is in the character development of Doug, movingly brought to life by Ben Affleck, and in the suspense surrounding the bank heists.  Its weakness is that the plot sometimes borders on becoming unbelievable, especially in the chase scenes, which is why I give it 4.5 stars rather than five. That being said, Ben Affleck's characterization of Doug Macray is completely believable. He has managed to create a sympathetic criminal whom we root for in spite of ourselves.

0316067938|1.0|I have rarely written a bad review for a book.  However, I feel so compelled that I absolutely have to give this book a one star.  If I could, I would give it a ZERO star.      SPOILER:  This is the most disappointing ending one could possibly imagine.  Like many other readers, I am so disappointed that Bella turned into a vampire. After I got over that, I thought maybe there would be an awesome ending to this.  NO, Stephanie Meyer built up to the near climax, and then BAM, it becomes the ultimate anti-climax.  This is so disappointing.  The reader is expecting this awesome battle scene, and then at the end, all the bad guys run away.  Worse, the author leaves you thinking that maybe the bad guys will come back some day.    So, my gut was like, \\"So, are you trying to hold out on the readers so that you can write another damn vampire book and make more money?\\"  That has to be the only explanation for why she didn't finish this book.  There is basically NO ending whatsoever.  What is more lame is that she titled the last chapter \\"Happily Ever After,\\" while hinting that the bad guys might come back and hunt the Cullens down one by one.  That is a contradiction, don't you think?    LAME. LAME. LAME.    I give you, Ms Meyer, credit for the storyline throughout this whole Twilight series.  However, you need to go back to college and take more English and writing classes.  Work on it.  There is a reason why you have more than 1000 One star reviews.      Now, think about that.
030746363X|5.0|There are obvious misleading remarks and claims.  I've been involved with the Strength and Conditioning industry for a while, long enough for this book to not really peak my interest.  However, for someone that has no experience or direction, this book would be a great resource.    With that being said, some sections, will absolutely hit you like a ton of bricks.  There's a lot of content and even some will prove to be worth the price of the book.  Testosterone increase?  Sperm increase?  All around, this book is designed for someone that lacks critical knowledge in the field of exercise, but it does get pretty good at points.     One or two sections of this book will hit you, I can almost guarantee it.  This is where the price of the book is justified (it's dirt cheap, too).  The other parts are bonus, but you would be foolish not to read them anyway.  Perhaps it would take Tim Ferriss to make the every day exercises realize that most common fitness protocols are wrong.  Time will tell.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This film was very watchable. It was well produced, informative without being preachy. It does not condemn drilling for gas. Or tell us to kick the energy habit. It shows us the dangers of removing legislation that was once in place, which would have forced corporations to drill gas safely. It stresses that without regulation corporations will always seek the cheapest/fastest route.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|With a bunch of original-Tron viewers from 1982, Tron:  Legacy had some big shoes to fill.  And boy, does it ever...    The original Tron was groundbreaking in terms of its incorporation of CG special effects - the first of its kind to do so in a mind-blowing way.  Granted, the original looks horrifically dated now, but as I explained to my 7-year old daughter:  \\"This movie came out when less than 8% of the public owned a computer.  Think about 12 of your friends and then say, 'I'm the only one with a computer.'  Effects like the one in this movie (which has been completely exceeded in PC, PS3, Wii and XBOX 360 games) simply didn't exist.  The original rendering was performed with 2 MB of RAM...you were considered rich if you had a computer with 256KB!\\"  And Tron was a fun adventure story about programmer Kevin Flynn and his search for evidence linking his name to the creation of blockbuster arcade games stolen by his rival, Ed Dillinger who took over Encom.  Kevin Flynn is inadvertently transported to the computer world by the Master Control Program, an evil AI program that has designs of its own for the real world.  Kevin subsequently meets the security program, Tron, designed by real-world programmer Alan Bradley.  Together, they manage to vanquish the MCP and Kevin obtains the evidence he needs to establish his rightful place within Encom.    Tron:  Legacy picks up the story 28 years later.  In the past (1989), we come across Kevin's son Sam Flynn , a boy that has a great relationship with his father who speaks reverently of creating a new computer Grid where he, his own program CLU (\\"Codified Likeness Utility\\" - loved that), and Tron (transported from the original Grid where the MCP had once resided) worked diligently to bring about a new world order.  Kevin is somewhat cryptic about the \\"miracle\\" that he has found there before leaving his son to go back to work.  Kevin Flynn subsequently disappears leaving Sam as an orphan living with his grandparents.      Fast forward to the present and we come across Sam as a reckless recluse who seems to take delight in pulling off an annual prank on Encom (which has become a greedy, directionless corporation).  Alan Bradley still works for the company, but his shared views of Kevin Flynn's dream of making data management/sharing more accessible and affordable to everyone is obviously quashed under the current corporate machine.    Alan Bradley then receives a mysterious page on a quite antiquated pager (something that the movie does well in poking fun at) from Flynn's old arcade building.  Alan relays the information to Sam who discovers his father's secret project and, in turn, is transported to the computer world as well.  What follows is a wonderful story filled with religious allegory and reunification intertwined with bittersweet circumstances where CLU has usurped his own creator in his own quest for perfection.  I won't spoil the movie for you beyond that.  I will say this, however; many critics have lit up Olivia Wilde's role by stating that her purpose is to \\"look pretty.\\"  I will give this much up:  Olivia Wilde brings to the role a childlike wonder of everything that she hears about the real world with a great deal of heartfelt sincerity and believability.  It's almost hard to imagine that she IS acting it, because she pulls it off quite well.  To speak any more of it would be to ruin a potential plot point, so I won't.  I just wanted to throw it out there, however, because critics were unduly harsh.    I was 9 when I watched the original, but as a parent now, the pang of watching Kevin's son dealing with the loss of his father hits me square in the chest.  Like I mentioned earlier, the movie has grown up with me and it's a powerful nod and acknowledgment for those of us who loved the original Tron as kids and who are watching the current movie now as adults.  The story's theme is darker and certainly delves into the \\"human condition\\" and everything about the agony of suffering your own mistakes, however well-intentioned your purposes were.    There have been too many critics who have lambasted this film and I simply think that they don't get it.  Roger Ebert, at least, seems to get it quite well - he loved the original Tron and gives Tron:  Legacy a solid 3 out of 4 stars.  Too many others don't, however, and seem to feel that anyone who loves this film is a \\"fanboy\\" of sorts.    Well, count me in as a \\"fanboy\\".  Tron:  Legacy has created a beautiful story and the visuals are stunning to say the least.  The soundtrack is an awesome landscape as well; kudos to Daft Punk for constructing a soundtrack that is quite an impressive blend of both electronica and the London Philharmonic.  Thanks, Disney, for making a 9-year old boy smile again and for making our children shake their heads in wonder about a past that was yet to experience a digital revolution in both life and film.
0446195529|5.0|After the initial explosion in Lafayette Park, which sets the tone for the book, the story slows down for a hundred or so pages.  Then, British Agent Mary Chapman is assigned to help investigate the case (and action picks up) as it was thought that her PM, may have been the target.  After their investigation begins in earnest, it takes numerous twists and turns.  When their lives are threatened, and violence continues, Stone knows that someone is out to stop him.  But who?  His own government, the Russian Mob or the Mexican Drug Cartel? It makes for interesting reading as the characters are well developed and the Camel Club members return to help Stone in getting answers concerning the bomb in the Park.  David Baldacci is a heck of a story teller and I ask how he comes up with such a plot.  Is the undercover world of the spy, with a large dose of  politics really like this?  After I got past the initial slow part, it was hard to put this book down.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years. I came to love the characters and even forgot it is a work of fiction! Had a love/hate relationship with the last few pages:  Wanted to know how it ended and didn't want to finish the book and lose my new 'friends'.  After a bit of a slow start, it drew me into a time and place I had only passing knowledge of.  Recommend it to everyone. A grand story.

0316019984|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my friend's twin boys who are 3 1/2.  One is a HUGE fan of super heroes.  At his young age, he can name almost every DC and Marvel character (\\"real name\\" AND super hero alias)!  I can't even begin to explain how excited he was to open this book.  He literally wouldn't put it down for over 30 minutes.  We finally took it away from him so he would open other gifts.  The adults in the room were just as impressed.  I have to admit it's the best Pop Up book I've ever seen.    My only concern at this point is that the art work in the book is a little delicate.  I'm not sure how long it will hold up under the hands of an enthusiastic pre-schooler. But, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again for another fan!

One of my all-time favorites.
0316017922|3.0|I like this book. It shows you how to be successful. Although that is not quite true. Malcolm Gladwell has researched other people that have been successful and tries to find out why.<br />In the end it comes down to having 10,000 hours of practice in a certain field. And examples to make this point valid are sought by Malcolm Gladwell and found. However, that is where he goes wrong. He uses the example of Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates and then moves on to Steve Ballmer. However, Steve Ballmer was never a programmer, unlike Gladwell tries to argue.<br />The other thing that disturbs me in this book is that Gladwell is good at arriving at a conclusion, but does not try to disprove his own conclusion. How do we know that there are no other factors involved in those that became outliers if he does not try to disprove his own theory?<br /><br />You can basically sum up his book by saying that those who became a success did so by practicing their craft for 10,000 hours. But what about those who also practiced for 10,000 hours and did not become a success?

B001MEJY8W|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of horror/slasher  type movies and I can watch just about ANYTHING- but this movie left me feeling sick and disgusted with myself after is was all over. I am sickened that this was even made in the first place. The plot summary intrigued me and I thought it may be something like Darkness (Spanish horror movie)- but this movie ended up having no plot or resolution. For most of the movie you were watching a very large man violently pummel a small, chained woman. It felt like I was watching a snuff film. The beatings went on and on and on until they had almost killed her and then they skinned her alive. I will not even go into why they said that they were doing this because the reason is so absurd. Basically, if you choose to watch this movie you will just watch a man graphically beat on a woman for about an hour or so. If that is your choice of entertainment then perhaps you should seek help.
1439177783|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Though I have never had an eating disorder, It made me realize that so many people have a dysfunctional relationship with their bodies and with food, even if it never gets to the point where it falls under the eating disorder category.  Thinking about everything we eat, why we shouldn't be eating it, depriving ourselves, comforting ourselves with food, feeling like food is an adversary is a disorder, even if we are at what would be considered a normal weight.  Just because the extremes are not as harmful as anorexia or bulemia, that does not mean that there is not insanity attached to what we believe about food.<br /><br />This book also made me realize how much we really do glorify a person being famous and thin.  It also made me wonder how many of the actresses in hollywood are living an unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle and portraying a seemingly outward appearance of perfection.  What price are these women really paying to look \\"perfect\\" and why are we aspiring to look like them?<br /><br />I really appreciate Portia's honesty and vulnerability in writing this book.  As it turns out, the truth really does hurt as well as ultimately set you free.
B00006IUIG|5.0|This one's bizarre. Of course, it's supposed to be bizarre. And it's classically bizarre so it belongs in anyone's serious movie collection. Combining The Cure, science fiction, flying dreams and a frustrated movie director - Fellini should certainly know.

030746363X|5.0|I found this book to be a concise and excellent read. Entertaining and enlightening at the same time. I highly recommend reading this book to get things like diet and exercise boiled down and condensed to what works and what matters. Its unfortunate how many educated people are still teaching wives-tales based on the junk science of the past. I am in the process of going back through the book, taking notes and applying what I have learned. I found the book to confirm some things I personally thought or suspected and other things I already knew. But it is loaded with things I did not know, have not heard of or have not been exposed to. I also like the encouragement to do self-experiment (in a reasonable manner) to fine tune and tweak what works for you. I am amused and impressed with Tim's ability to think outside the box, crunch data, deconstruct, and boil things down to get the 20% (application) that gives you 80% (results). I was surprised that more ground wasn't covered in some areas, and that some \\"rabbit holes\\" weren't explored deeper. I guess that could leave things open for another book like it or an expanded edition in the future. I was reading this book like a madman as much and as fast as I could. I give it two thumbs up. I'm looking forward to a new me in the near future.
0321687299|5.0|I'm a user experience engineer- and as a developer heavily invested in front-end development, I have both a professional and casual interest in keeping up with web standards and new technologies. I bought Introducing HTML5 as a way to have the huge amount of widely-scattered information about html 5 in one place. It has served this role extremely well; it's engaging, it's informative, and, most importantly, it's easy to read. It's not just a reference manual- we have the W3C spec for that. It's a conversation with the reader about the hows and whys of html 5.

B0045DO8NI|5.0|I wish artists would wait longer for a greatest hits release. Not sure though if this is part of the marketing machine of the label, or a choice by the artist, but with that being said, this is a great collection. As I have all of her cds, I can say most of the best songs are included here, though a few could have been left off and others added, but everyone has their own opinion of that anyway. So what is great about this cd/dvd collection? well for one it's a cd/dvd collection. Pink is an artist that needs to be appreciated both for her music and for her videos. She looks good and has fun in her videos. Her videos are both stark and visually stunning, Her funhouse video being a prime example of this. The two bonus songs on this collection are fine, but how great they are, I can only let time tell. They didn't really \\"hit\\" me when I first heard them, as with most of my favorite songs by her. But they are well done, and will probably grown on me, if they were on an album and not a GH collection, I am not sure if that would make a difference or not. the DVD is great and includes pretty much all the videos you'd want. Well put together, and not a hodge podge collection like with some artists/labels. As stated I have all of her cds, indluding the Funhouse tour live in Australia, so some of the videos are redundant, or they are on one of the bonus dvds that came with previous albums but that's fine, having them all in one section is great. I am a collector, and I love to have the Little Extras that artists offer. You wont' be disappointed with the cd/dvd collection of this Album. Only drawback is I wish (with every artist and every greatest hits collection) that she would have had the lyrics to the songs in this collection. Sure they are mostly available on the albums, but this collection is set up like a book with nice pictures etc, so it would have been nice to have the lyrics in the book as well. But that's a very minor issue I have. Overall it's a great collection and a must have, if you are new to Pink this is a great place to start. In an age of Britney's and Xtinas Pink stands on her own and stands apart from the pack, though she is probably the most dangerous of them all (but in a good way) It's nice to see she's had such a strong and lengthy career. I hope she is around for a long time to come.

Apart from being a great story (as I think everyone knows) it's also perfect for German language learners. It's not too much of a mouthful, I've found that I can read it with about 80-90% fluency now, looking up an occasional word. I definitely recommend it!

B002ZG99N6|3.0|Overall this film is definitely worth watching. That being said I would highly recommend a rental before buying. Acting was good and good Directing but fell short and got lost somewhere along the way. No real Chemistry between Affleck and Hall. Renner's character was ok but one way or another you really don't care either way what happens to these people. I think they only showed \\"the crew\\" all together once or twice and I could not tell you a single detail about the other Two members of the crew aside from Affleck and Renner. You are not pulling for Affleck OR his nemesis Jon Hamm. I thought the Action was good but they really don't go into the Characters enough. At the end of the Film I was kind of like, \\"that's it\\"? I had heard this often compared to \\"HEAT\\" with Pacino and Deniro but I personally wouldn't compare the Two Films. As I said worth watching.
0142002038|3.0|I'm sure most readers know about the rank racism that runs rampant in the James Bond books. Yes, it was a \\"sign of the times\\" and all that, but that doesn't make it any more bearable to read today. Such a shame to mar otherwise good books with this ugliness.    The racism cannot be overlooked, but if you can get through it, the action sequences at the end are extremely well-written and exciting. I was certainly sucked in, holding my breath, even though I knew darn well that James Bond must live through it and triumph over evil. A book that can build that type of suspense is still worth a read.

0061906220|5.0|We saw this book at our local library.  The cover enticed my 4 year old, so we brought it home.  The story is simple and cute, the illustrations are great. We can't wait for another Pete The Cat story! Both the 4 year old and 6 year old loved it.
B000002H38|5.0|The album cover of \\"Rapture\\" reveals all you need to know about Anita Baker and her music: soft, sweet, sultry, colorful, inspired, breath-taking in its size and delicate features. Beautiful to behold, and a treat to ears and mind to listen to, Anita Baker is the quintessential female R&B and Jazz crooner. She was the voice of romance in the mid eighties to mid nineties, when she dropped off the musical map to start a family. But once heard, her voice can never be forgotten, so unique in it richness of depth, and soothing in it's soulful caress.<br /><br />\\"Rapture\\" released in 1986, is the sophomore album from Anita Baker that stormed onto the charts with \\"Sweet Love\\", and Caught Up in The Rapture\\". But in my opinion every release save one, \\"Watch Your Step\\", is an unqualified hit!  From the opening track \\"Sweet Love\\", the CD seems to float from track to track at the same pace; never too slow, never too fast.  It's mellow candlelight, white wine, and grapes lets talk quietly music.  Its \\"lets make love slow and easy, exploring every inch of each others bodies music.\\" Its \\"I want to relax and let Anita's voice sooth away the cares of the day music.\\"<br /><br />\\"I won't neglected,<br />I won't be denied,<br />The pleasure of your kisses,<br />The pleasure of your smile,<br /><br />I think you take for grant<br />I'll always be here<br />Just because I love you<br />It doesn't mean I won't disappear<br /><br />Been so long...of missin' you baby<br />Been so long...of missin' you baby\\"<br /><br />How many woman (an no doubt some men), can identify with the words and thoughts Anita sings so eloquently about in track 4 \\"Been So Long\\". Strong woman yes, but also needful, stressing the anthem of her heart to her lover:  \\"Love me or I'll leave!\\"<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Jazz, or the Manhattan Transfer will recognize and appreciate the evocative beauty Anita brings to her retention \\"Mystery.\\" In this cut her voice takes on a smoky, soft tones that conjures images of a dimly lit lounge, smoke drifting in clouds around patrons memorized by the small caramel skinned diva on stage as she effortless draws a picture with her voice.

B002ZG980U|3.0|I've sure seen worse movies. It was easy enough to follow, for me, but I can see where many would be scratching their heads.<br /><br />The acting was well done and my surprise was Ellen Page who I'd only heard vague references to in the media. This may be her breakout role, at least it is to me.<br /><br />What gets me about this movie is that you never really know what is dream and what is real. That's kind of cool in a way, but you have to wonder if any of these people really exist or are just figments of Leo DeCaprio's imagination. After his work in Shutter Island, I have to wonder.<br /><br />We bought this movie but realized we should have rented it as we'll probably never watch it again. Not because we hated it, but because it just doesn't have any great appeal. Recommended for fans of the actors and director only.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|Bottom-Line: \\"Need You Now\\" is a mostly satisfying mixture of fast (mostly misses) and slow tracks but it's on the slower more soulful track that \\"Need You Now\\" sounds its best.<br /><br />As I wrote in a recent review I am fast falling in love with the XM Satellite Radio installed my 2008 Cadillac CTS.  One of the reason I very seldom listen to commercial radio is well, the commercial part; I have come to loath advertisements!  I just start enjoying the music, and sorry, time for a long, long series of commercials!  And so the search on the radio dial for more music begins.<br /><br />Not so with XM Satellite Radio.  Sure, there are occasional announcement, but they have nothing at all to do with pitching stuff I do not need, want, or want to hear about; it's just music and not the same looped play lists now common on the conglomerate commercial broadcast radio stations ; where the new stuff?<br /><br />It's on XM Satellite Radio that I first heard the song Need You Know from a fresh new group out of Nashville, Lady Antebellum.  I liked the track--from the trios 2nd CD entitled \\"Need You Now\\" --so much that I decided to check the group out and reserved both of the C&W groups CD's at the local library.  I did not care to the first release the self-titled Lady Antebellum; I found little on the album to recommend.  In contrast I enjoyed \\"Need You Now\\" especially the title track (No.1) and track No.3 American Honey.<br /><br />Lady Antebellum is composed of Charles Kelley (lead and background vocals), Dave Haywood (background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin) and Hillary Scott (lead and background vocals). Pianist Jim Brickman featured the group on his single Never Alone in 2007 and shortly thereafter Lady Antebellum signed with Capitol Records Nashville and released Love Don't Live Here (track No.1). The track would go on to peak at #3 on the Hot Country Songs chart in May 2008 and served as the first single from the groups self-titled debut album, which is certified platinum in the U.S.<br /><br />Lady Antebellum's accolades include Top New Duo or Group (2009) awarded by the Academy of Country Music, New Artist of the Year in 2008 by the Country Music Association; a 2009 Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for the single I Run to You.  The group picked up and an additional two wards from 45th ACM Awards for Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year (Need You Now), and Single of the Year (Need You Now).<br /><br />Based on the strength of the single Need You Now, and later, American Honey, both of which I heard on XM, I had high hopes for Lady Antebellum's debut album because they tend to be one of the better CD's a group releases.  However, I have been largely disappointed in Lady Antebellum, the album.  Not so with \\"Need You Now.\\"<br /><br />\\"Need You Now\\", released in January 2010, has thus far spawned the singles Need You Now, (track No. 1), American Honey (track No. 3), and a completely forgettable song, Hello World (track No.4).<br /><br />To be honest the same things that made the group's debut album a bust in my opinion are still somewhat present on this CD, namely the lyrics--most co-written by group members--are for the most part been uninspiring, the instrumentation just okay (where are the C&W signature instruments on most tracks?), and the vocal are lackluster and lacking in soulful presence.  However, there are gems I can pull out from the CD.<br /><br />The fast tracks do not work at all on this album, but the slower tracks, namely Need You Now, American Honey, When You Got a Good Thing (track No.7), If I Knew Then (track No.9), Something `Bout A Woman (track No.10), and Ready to Love Again (track 10) are all worth a listen.  While the faster tracks suffer from almost too much energy, too much noise (they almost have a rock vibe going on), which serve to drown out the lead vocalists voices, the slower tracks let the listener hear what turns out to be solid vocal talent, if allowed to \\"speak\\".<br /><br />As I wrote in my review of Lady Antebellum the voice(s) of Charles Kelly and Hillary Scott do not complement each other very well at all, at least not on that CD; it's gotten a little better on this CD, but only on the slower tracks.  Neither vocalist has a very strong voice, especially Ms. Scott, so the harmonizing doesn't work all the time.  Solo, each voice is fine if not drowned out by over-active instrumentation like on track No.2 Our Kind of Love, No.6 Love This Pain, and track No.8 Stars Tonight.<br /><br />My favorite track on the CD is American Honey, which showcases Hillary Scotts understated but ultimately pretty voice.  The track is vintage C&W: quiet, understated, soulful and emotive with just the right of C&W instrumentation thrown in make it an enjoyable country track.<br /><br />I do not know what the group was trying for in the Hello World (track No.4), but the song made little lyrical sense to me.  I loved the piano play in the backdrop of the track, but overall the song did not work for me.<br /><br />\\"Need You Now\\"  is a mostly satisfying mixture of fast (mostly misses) and slow tracks but it's on the slower more soulful track that \\"Need You Now\\" sounds its best.

B000RZOR2U|4.0|To the best of my knowledge, this Telefunken \\"Das Alte Werke\\" set was the first ever integral recording of the Bach cantatas. It is not the first complete recording, that was Rilling, but Rilling never set out with the intention to record them all, it sort of developed that way. As a result, the gap between the first and last Rilling recordings is more than 20 years, and the later recordings, although performed on modern instruments and with women's voices, were informed by the growing knowledge of period practice. The \\"Das Alte Werke\\" set was the first set to seek a unified approach, and in addition to try to recapture the sort of sound that would have been more like the sound Bach would have heard, using copies of the instruments that he would have known.<br /><br />I have not heard all of these cantatas, but I know many of them from the initial LP releases I have in my collection, in their nice brown boxes (2 LPs per box) with miniature scores and detailed booklets. I enjoyed them, but, in my opinion, they have been surpassed. Nicky and Gus were trailblazers in the business of \\"authentic\\" performance (insofar as actual authentic performance is possible), and they of course suffer from the fact that people who follow reap the benefit of lessons learned and take things one step further. The use of these instruments was in its infancy and the orchestral sound is often thin and scrawny, the intonation of the valveless natural horns and trumpets often insecure. And occasionally I was caused to wonder whether some of these recordings had been made in Nicky's garden shed. In the now nearly 40 years that has followed, new generations of players have made these instruments their own. The Gardiners, Suzukis, Herreweghes and Koopmans have advanced the art and their orchestras sound much better than the orchestras in these works.<br /><br />In the interests of \\"authenticity\\", the \\"Das Alte Werke\\" recordings eschewed women singers, opting to go with boy sopranos and counter-tenors. Bach would naturally have used all-male singers. However, boys' voices broke much later in Bach's time, so Nicky and Gus are actually trying to reproduce a sound that no longer exists, indeed that no longer CAN exist. Having said that, the quality of the singing is generally very good, and some of the boy soloists (from various boy's choirs, including the Vienna Boys' Choir and the King's College Cambridge choir) are really quite amazing (e.g., the opening solo of BWV28). The contributions of the grown-up soloists are also often outstanding (Max van Edmond and Paul Esswood come particularly to mind).<br /><br />Having said all that, and acknowledging that this is a monumental achievement of the recording industry, I know enough about this set not to want to buy it, because to me the Gardiner/Suzuki sets sound so much better. However, I know people who absolutely adore this set, and who like the feeling of \\"insecurity\\", of operating slightly on the edge, of the whole thing, because this is what Bach must have been used to, considering he often had only a week to write, rehearse and perform a new cantata. These folk are the natural customers for this set. For anyone else, before splashing out this much money, I'd advise getting a single set of the cantatas (I believe the two-LP sets were released in CD form) and listen to one, to see whether you like the approach and the sound - and of course comparing with the likes of Gardiner and Suzuki, not to mention older recordings such as Richter, Rilling and Werner.<br /><br />One of the enormous (and to me enormously irritating) conceits of this set when it first appeared was the statement, more or less in so many words, that this was the only way to play Bach, and that any other approach was wrong. Hopefully, this has been erased from the record by now. This is music for eternity and should be played to the full extent of its artistic and aesthetic possibilities, not strapped in a stylistic straitjacket, using women's voices and modern instruments, if need be. I still turn to the old Erato Werner recording of BWV140 and the glory of the three trumpeting L&auml;ubin brothers blowing up a storm in Rilling's BWV129. Bach performance is not set in stone, nor should it be.nts, if need be.

B003YBNREI|1.0|Little if anything new here. A little less gutsy, a little more slick, the songs don't reach for much. Typical DBros., and will sell ok to longtime fans.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|Well, I kinda expected that the writers would have answered a FEW more of the questions that they had posed. I figured they would leave it somewhat open-ended to leave the option for a movie or another series, but come on... Only two or three answers to the dozens of questions? What was the reason for the Darma Initiative? Who was behind it? Stuff like that. Sigh. Oh well, it's over. The overall experience was somewhat of a let-down. For a die-hard fan, it was probably awesome, but I found very little of substance. Sadly, the writers seem to have focused to much on trying to create Star Wars on the beach, and not taking advantage of what they had to work with.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Very well crafted and written, perfect for children and adults.  Kind of like 300 for kids but with Owls.   Somewhat educational because the owls provide their type sometimes.   I haven't read the book but I thought it was   visually stunning and adorable.

B003ITR3TG|5.0|I belive America's facination with the Mafia began in 1972 with Francis Ford Cappola's Godfather and then was reinforced with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas in 1990.  This episode has both.  Bravo writers of Community.  What makes me love this episode so much is the fact that such a racial diverse and religously scattered group of people could operate at this level.  The obvious refrences to iconic mafia realted movies actually takes a backseat to the true message this episode was trying to convay and that was one of a shift of power.  Although Ahbed's intelligence offered imideate benefits to the group in the end Jeff's intrinsitic leadership prevailed, albeit selfishly motivated.  If your going to watch only one epside of Community, let this be the one.
B003629IPW|5.0|Because of this film I believe I have a much better understanding of Michael Jackson. The footage was shot during the rehearsals for the concert named THIS IS IT (which was not performed due to Michael's tragically premature death). The art directing and staging were spectacular, and Producer / Director Kenny Ortega (who directed Dirty Dancing, High School Musical, several previous Michael Jackson Tours, and more) seemed a perfect compliment to Michael. (I understand that Ortega is largely responsible for the editing of This Is It.)<br /><br />From this film you come away with a pretty good idea of how astounding that concert would have been. The footage is interspersed with short interviews with the musicians, dancers and crew, but most of the film shows Michael rehearsing--singing and dancing. Because there is no narrator, it doesn't feel like a documentary, though in the truest sense that's what it really is.<br /><br />Michael is not interviewed, but his interactions with others are shown, and from such scenes you get a better idea of what kind of person Michael Jackson really was. What this film also reveals that you can't see in finished videos is the thought and work that go into each creation. Sometimes Michael stops the rehearsal to make modifications or to explain how (to use his own words) \\"the value would be greater\\" if something would be done in a specific way. These scenes really show us the extraordinary theatrical sense that Michael possessed. You see that Michael knew how to transform that which was already wonderful, into something magnificent, and how he recognized (and gently carried those around him toward) the sublime.<br /><br />Michael performs most of his best-known works in the film. Though he speaks of trying to reserve his voice and energy during these rehearsals, on occasion he gets caught up by the music so that he just can't hold back and he is splendid to behold. Michael's performance of Billie Jean is truly awe-inspiring. Before watching this film I knew that Michael was talented. Now I not only see that he was a brilliant artist, but I understand that throughout his life Michael Jackson had sculpted his very self into a Masterpiece.<br /><br />Thank You, Michael. We love what you gave us. You stand among giants.hat Michael was talented.

B003B2BE6I|5.0|I love this episode but only for 45 seconds at the 9:50 mark.  The writers for this show went off the charts for this scene.  So as the cast tries to get Ahbed to be a different person when picking up girls they do a practice run with Annie played by Alison Brie.  Alison Brie IS a character in Mad Men and Abed acts like Don Draper from Mad Men.  Not only is the irony of the scene impecable, but the acting is pristine.  Im going to give it up to Ahbed on his impersonation of Don Draper but Annie... wow.  When you watch this watch this watch her, she is excellent..her body language and reaction is amazing.  Abed's usage of the signature Don Draper Hook (its what I call it) when he curls his index finger and lodges it up underneath the chin to pull in the kiss......unstoppable.  Watch this scene with a keen eye.  Great job writers of Community.

And I use it a lot!<br />There are positive affirmations in many areas ..Health, Forgivenes, Prosperity, Creativity, Relationships, Success, Stress Free Living and Self Esteem. The affirmations are uplifiting and fun to repeat!<br />These affirmations are a good way to reinforce any other type of self help you may be doing. They are wonderful to keep saying even if you have already gotten into the habit of thinking positively, and they also remind us of when we aren't thinking so positively and help us to change that!<br /><br />The book is just the right size too! large enough to be able to read easily, but also small enough so that you can easily slip it into your purse or a travel bag, to take with you anywhere.<br /><br />There is also an audio CD in the back of the book that you can listen to aloud that contains all the written affirmations in the book. Reading the written affirmations, and listening to the CD in conjunction with each other helps you to change your negative thoughts to Positive ones more quickly!

B002ZG99NG|4.0|You've got to be one heck of a [[ASIN:B001CC7PKS Daredevil]] to attempt pulling off robbing a bank. So what are the chances that you could find three brave friends that also think robbing banks is a good way to make a living? According to Ben Affleck, if you live in Charlestown, MA, your chances would be better than anywhere else in the US.<br /><br />So goes the story of The Town. Ben, Jeremy Renner and a couple of other guys hit Boston area banks with spooky looking masks and make off with the loot. Things get complicated when Ben gets too up close and personal with one of the bank managers. So he decides to move up to the \\"major leagues\\" with one more giant heist before calling it quits.<br /><br />I think this story has been written many different ways always with a different title: Guy gets wrapped up in crime, sees the light, and wants to get out of crime. But The Town is so well done that as you watch you forget about the familiarity. The Town is well acted and full of action. At times some of the car chasing and shootouts are a little farfetched, but they are certainly thoroughly entertaining...and so is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The Town is definitely one of the best action/dramas of the year. I don't think it needs to be added to my collection, but it was well worth the On Demand purchase. Highly recommended.
B00192IV9U|3.0|I appreciate being able to hear his voice again and God bless those who tried to put together a decent CD of his last works, but I cannot give this CD anything but 3 stars since it doesn't embody the exceptional intellectual ability, creativity, or originality associated with the achievement of unprecedented insight that was Michael Jackson...and nothing ever will again.   This CD only shows us what we lost will never come again.   I have loved Michael Jackson since I was born in 1966 and I will never stop loving him. My mother played his music for me while I was inside of her and at my funeral his music will be played. He was a genius and gave us everything he had inside with love and I feel blessed to have lived in the time of Michael Jackson.

I got the book this morning and was so happy!    This vendor, Massbookstore, however, hasn't even answered my first email -- I sent three. I only got an automail that said that they will answer me in 3 days.    It is sad to see how a bigger bookstore has less service than a smaller one.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is an imaginative thriller that keeps one on the edge of their seat.  The success of the film is due to the remarkable performance of Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers.  Her character is always on the edge, first to win the role of the Swan Queen, then to translate her cool perfection into the more passionate role of the Black Swan.  Her character is unsettled and going through a nervous breakdown as she tries to be the perfect dancer and cope with her own feelings of failure and that, once she s a success, that her life will go downhill until she is discarded.     It is interesting to compare Black Swan to the ballet Swan Lake. The original libretto of Swan Lake ballet had Prince Siegfried and Odette (the Swan Queen) die together, thus releasing the handmaidens from the sorcerer's curse.  However, the ending was considered too sad so the ballet was changed to allow the prince and Odette live and break the spell.  The film goes back to the more tragic ending.  The threatening bird-like dancer who appears at the beginning of the film is the sorcerer responsible for the curse in the ballet.  So Nina is cursed herself into striving for perfection that is her own undoing    The film plays off Nina's fears that someone will take her place in the role of the Black Swan; her represses sexual nature and fears that she will be discarded like the former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder).  Adding to Nina's insecurity is Lily who appears to want to thwart Nina to claim the role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan while professing to admire her.  Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey) is pushing her daughter into the spotlight from her own failure to become a ballet star.     Natalie Portman's performance is remarkable for the range of emotions she displays. She is on screen for almost all of the film, and it is her performance that makes the film. The supporting cast is also excellent: Barbara Hershey is obsessive in subtitle ways about her daughter's success down to a ballerina music box that plays music from Swan Lake. Mila Kunis was convincing as her rival, down the wings tattooed on her back and Winona Ryder turns in a solid performance as the spurred Beth.       The film is beautifully photographed and the ballet scenes are nicely choreographed.  Potential viewers should be aware that the film is very intense at times as we are drawn into Nina's hallucinations.  Black Swan is also among the most creative films in recent memory and is certainly a film that cannot be forgotten.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|Tribal Leadership is written to do more than entertain / inform; it is to be put into practice by leaders determined to deliver extraordinary results through people within their organizations. I read Tribal Leadership seeking to be a more effective leader of my organization but discovered in it seeds of hope for my country Kenya and Africa in general.     Though it is written with American organizations in mind, it delivers critical insights about observed human behavior which prove universal from my perspective, having been born and brought up in Africa where ethnic tribes still exist and exhibit all the characteristics described in the book (especially stage one to which sections of my country descended in 2008 after a disputed general election). Tribal Leadership identifies the various stages of tribal culture and, more important, how to move tribes from one stage to the next.     Through applying Tribal Leadership principles, I now see hope for my country and it's 42 tribes; that the very thing (tribal identity at stage one) that has been used to divide us can be now be used to bring us together as small tribes (extended families) to larger tribes (known as clans), the ethnic communities and finally bring the entire nation together to achieve it's purpose for this generation.     If it can do this for Africa, I have no doubt it can do this for any organization in the world whose leader is determined to bring out the best in his/her team members.     I would encourage any practicing and aspiring leader to read AND apply the principles so well expressed in this book.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I watched it in theaters and did not understand it. It didn't really do much for me for some reason. After watching it I picked up the comics of it and read them as well as watched the graphic novels movie. After this, I had THE understanding of watchmen and it definitely made more sense. So when it came out on blu ray i was hesitate. Then I realized the director's cut is nearly an extra half hour of material in the film. This borught so much more to the film and offered much more understanding of the comics and overall story. Some might not be able to get into it, but believe me this movie is a work of art by the amazing director Zack Snyder and is so so intelligent. Please do not be immature due to male nudity. It's nothing we all haven't seen before, except its blue. Anywho, this one is hands down one of the best movies of 2009 for me, right up there with up in the air and star trek! I'd advise everyone to watch it that has a mature mind and can watch the full three hours of this epic film.<br /><br />Also Zack Snyder has a new movie coming out in March 2011 called \\"SuckerPunch\\". Snyder said he wanted to create a movie with an all girl cast kicking tail like he did with the men from 300. In all honesty I respect him even more because he's doing this. I think its a pretty awesome idea and that the film will be nothing short of epic just like 300 and watchmen. I hope I've been helpful..<br /><br />-Cam
B003Y58CKS|5.0|I have just watched and am now coming down from this wonderful production.  It cannot be compared to the excellent Ponnelle because that is a filmed production with exquisite appropriate real settings.  In my opinion, it is better than the MacVicar which is also staged and to which I gave five stars.  Nothing else currently out on DVD deserves mention.<br /><br />As everyone else has noted, this deserves the full (if not more) five stars.  But going through the reviews, it seems that one aspect of the direction of Lehnhoff and the acting of Damrau and Lucic has been missed.  In this production Gilda is furious with her father for his overprotectiveness and for penning her up.  Damrau's Gilda is not the insipid little girl as she is usually played, she is a determined innocent who is led astray (to say the least) by her complete lack of experience, and being cloistered and motherless.  Little wonder that she is entranced by the handsome charismatic duke (Florez) with all that leads to.  She is also most certainly not helped by a father who is far too caught up in his own feelings to pay more than lip service to his daughter.  Lehnhoff's direction emphasises this.  She is emotionally let down again and again throughout the opera by her father.  Therein lies the tragedy.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|The love story is very similar to others but the people are truely unique. All of the different problems seem very overwhelming but begin to twine together in a beautiful plot. The ending really brings a smile to your face after all the tears.
0783229526|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie since so many people seem to love it. However, I bought it and watched and totally hated it. I was bored the whole time. I didn't find it funny or interesting and there didn't appear to a plot of any kind. Waste of time and money.
6305633177|5.0|I first saw this video in 1988 when I was a long-haired, guitar-playing, denim jacket-wearing metal-head. Naturally, I was Metallica fan so this mostly-bootleg footage video was awesome. It was awesome then and it's even more awesome now.<br /><br />It's pretty hard for me to believe that today's metal fans don't know that this twenty-three year-old video is made up of 95% bootleg videos recorded by fans on VHS in the 1980's (how did they get those giant cameras in the shows back then?). It's shameful to read the reviews of \\"Metallica fans\\" who whine about the video quality of VHS bootlegs recorded nearly a quarter-century ago. I didn't know there was anyone left who didn't know what \\"Cliff 'em All\\" was.<br /><br />Cliff was less a bassist and more an artist. He was one of a kind. I miss his solos, which were more like five-minute symphonies on bass. I'm glad to have several of them on this DVD.<br /><br />I view this DVD as a time capsule. It contains some of the best music of my misspent youth played by some honest-to-goodness rock and rollers.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love the Russell T Davies era of DOCTOR WHO, and I was very sad to see David Tennant go -- but the show is as good or even better than ever with Stephen Moffat at the helm and Matt Smith as a somehow older seeming and goofier Doctor. Really fun and often inspiring television.
1439177783|5.0|It was very difficult for me to put this book down and at times difficult to read. I felt her struggle through the book. Though her honesty is what really got me. The book, \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" is also very well written. She is highly descriptive in a way that it is hard to misunderstand what she wants you to understand or feel in that moment. I think that every woman should read this book. It is one of my top favorite autobiographies. Personally, my favorite part is the epilogue when she discusses key things about dieting, weight, and food that I think many should know.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|As a fan of the original Karate Kid film, I was reluctant to give the new Jaden Smith/Jackie Chan version a try. But I did and am glad I did. The movie has a soul all of its own. Jaden Smith has some of his father's talent and some of his own (some of his double takes are eerily similar to his father's). He takes the role and makes it his own.  I am also not a big Jackie Chan fan, but found his performance as the mentor and Kung Fu teacher was touching and strong. For all my hesitations, this movie won me over. Four Stars.
0393338959|5.0|I am a materials scientist. That means no social scientist: the things I am working on are deterministic in nature. You can model them, isolate given phenomena and analyze their exact influence on your system. Still, deterministic systems are very complicated to model. Therefore I have always been skeptical about economics, that ultimately hope to model the aggregated behavior of humans -that are inextricable, each one of us is unique and behaves most often irrationally (undeterministically so to say). I took courses in economics in grad school, and wasn't convinced either: simple assumptions that are seldom justified, conclusions that stem from rather simple equations. All in all, except by diving very very deep into macroeconomical models, I doubt that it is possible for any of us to grasp correctly economics. However, nowadays everybody has his or her own opinion about how economics policy should look like. Isn't it inconsistent?    This reminds me of two things: the theory of relativity on the early 20th century and climate change today. Theories that are developed by experts, people who have spent their lives working on a given subject and know their stuff. Still, everybody had an idea about whether the theory of relativity was true or not, and today each layman pretends to be an expert in climatology able to destroy the work of thousands of scientists in a couple of minutes. That is nonsense but due to one thing: ideology. The same goes with economics where different schools based on ideology rather than hard facts.    The very good thing with that book is that Stiglitz remains extraordinarily balanced and rational. His view of economics seems to stem only from his lifetime work and experience, and not from a preconstructed ideology that would deform and twist his analysis. He acknowledges his errors and the strengths of his opponents, but arguments strongly and convinces the reader in favor of his thesis: markets are central but there should be some space forgovernment intervention through regulation. He never falls into one extreme or another. Maybe because he does not serve private interests, unlike many other representatives of corporate-funded think tanks or politicians one can hear daily on cable networks.  He is a social scientist that has not been blinded by ideologies but has adopted an unbiased approach to economics, leaving research and the study of the history of capitalism shape his views. In short, it seems to me that he is an honest and humble researcher that has not tried to show \\"scientfically\\" that his preconceived ideas were right, but has let his experience shape his mind. To me he is like every scientist should be. And this book is to me a plain evidence of his intellectual honesty.    Freefall is not an easy read compared to other from his biography, say, Roaring Ninetees, owing to the numerous footnotes the reader has constantly to refer to in order to fully grasp the story. The somehow weird strategy adopted to introduce economic and financial concepts to the newcomer also makes the reading trickya, as definitions and concepts are explained sometimes long after having been used. This is why I would not recommend this book as a first read to the crisis, even less as a first read to economics. Partly because of the technical vocabulary adopted, and partly because starting right away with an analysis of the 2007-present crisis without reading about the 90's would be wrong. However, this is a MUST read for everybody interested in understanding what has led us to collapse and how we can avoid -or at least mitigate- future crises.    All in all, this book does not strike hard only because of its sharp analysis of the reasons leading to the crisis and the global view it takes. It succeeds in presenting a balanced view of the role regulators must play in order for the economy and finance to play their initial role, way too often forgotten: help our societies going forward as a whole.

The special effects are great. I haven't read the series, and I don't want to, yet. It is fun watching the storyline unfold. I was glad to hear they ordered 13 more episodes, instead of the short six episode season.    If I could say anything bad about it, there are parts that could have more zombies in it. I think everyone should watch it at least once or twice and form their own opinion.

0091936152|4.0|A Colossal Failure of Common sense looks back at the events of the global financial crisis of 2007 and presents stories, information and analysis that are intended to shed light on those events. By describing his experiences within Lehman Brothers, that author, Lawrence McDonald, is able to present the reader with possible reasons for why Lehman Brothers collapsed along with so much of the greater financial market.    McDonald faces many challenges in presenting such a broad range of complex material. In most cases, he succinctly explains the various causes of the crash including the role of low interest rates in spurring risky investments, the bubble mentality that took hold in financial markets, the failure of Lehman management to predict or prevent the crisis within the firm, the proliferation of credit derivatives that facilitated the spread of risk, and the failure of ratings agencies to warn against this risk. Although he describes these factors clearly, he is hampered by certain choices made when writing the book. By choosing to target a broad audience with little financial knowledge and by avoiding in-depth and data-backed analysis of events, the author only partially succeeds in educating the reader. In addition, his biases are evident throughout, making it more difficult for the reader to trust that the author is providing an accurate account of the crisis. Still, the anecdotes and inside stories from within Lehman Brothers make for an interesting read.

0812550706|3.0|Ender's Game is rated the greatest science fiction novel on several top-100 websites, and that is how I found it. Midway through the book, the reasons behind this ranking became clear: its heroes are all children and teenagers, and teenagers are more likely to have voted for it on the Internet.    This is not to belittle Ender's Game, which is well-written as far as action goes. The book, the first of a series, assumes bug-like aliens are out to destroy the Earth and its colonies. Their defence requires an exceptional general, and he or she must be reared from the earliest childhood. So the novel tells the story of Ender Wiggin's struggle through spaceman military school, especially the battle room where increasingly fraught training is administered to young but not so tender saplings. And yes - without wanting to betray too much - Ender does find time to fight the bugs at some point.    Now the author, in his amazingly pompous introduction, says that the book was criticised for portraying children, or rather the exceptionally gifted youngsters who are his protagonists, as too adult-sounding. I don't think that is the case: his version of childhood seems to me tough but truthful. Where Ender's Game got less likely, however, was in its portrayal of the adult world, where press and politicians get duped by Ender's teenage siblings to the point that these become Earth-leading political figures. Nor do they do this through technological wizardry: we are asked to accept that an eleven-year-old becomes the world's foremost political writer and her brother an unparalleled diplomat. If that is a rather tall order, fortunately most of the novel focuses on Ender, nevertheless, and the rather lame political plot is marginal to the story. Ender's Game is thus worth reading for its battle-room storyline, even if it does not deserve the title of best sci-fi novel ever written.
B002ZG981E|5.0|If you're still on the fence about making the jump to Blu-ray, I have three words for you: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN MOVIES.<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" is based on the concept of lucid dreaming: that is, a dream you're aware of and even able to manipulate. By adding a MacGuffin in the form of a device that allows people to share dreams, the film opens up the possibility that certain people might engage in corporate espionage through it and that a person, trained well enough, could even create a lucid dream within that lucid dream.<br /><br />The plot is intense and it would take me a long time to describe the layers upon layers that are involved. Suffice it to say that it's worth watching and you shouldn't have trouble following it. I didn't.<br /><br />This film looked great on the big screen and it looks AMAZING on Blu-ray. Don't even bother with the DVD-only release, since this package comes with the film on Blu-ray *and* DVD *and* a digital copy, all for just one buck more.
030746363X|2.0|I received this book a few days early of the release and started into it. Everything seemed fine until I hit the sidebar (what Tim calls \\"GA boxes\\") on page 23. Here Tim, in his flippant style, suggests you loose 107 calors during a \\"kick-ass hour-long Stairmaster workout.\\" And, that that's only 7 calories better than sitting on the couch watching TV. Now a quick search on Google will provide you with information that suggests 107 calories likely not close to accurate at all. In fact, its most likely you loose between 300 to 600 calories depending on your weight, age, metabolism, level of exertion, etc. I actually asked Tim about this (I have a friend who knows him) and he wrote me a short rambling note that ended up by his stating that the overarching message was that diet is more important than exercise for weight loss (which had nothing to do with my question)? So I ask why make flippant comments you cannot back, especially if they add no value to your book?       I have not gotten further in the book because I smelled something fishy and after a few more minutes on the Web, I realize that there's a lot to be suspect about when it comes to the Author. I won't do a review of the author here, however. I'd just recommend you do a little homework before you jump on board and leave you with these two famous sayings: \\"If it looks too good to be true, it probably is\\" and \\"the devil is in the details.\\"

I don't think I need to incredible detail here since if you're thinking about reading it, you more than likely familiar with Ms. Austen's writing.

There isn't anything incredibly substantial to it, but it was a lot of fun and was romantic without being in-your-face-mushy.<br /><br />EDIT: November 2010<br />I raised my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars on goodreads. I re-read this book last night and had a wonderful time.  This book is incredibly fun little romp into fantasyland, all the while the main character, Jane, recognizes that this is exactly what we're doing.  It's like Jane Austen Lite (TM ;o)).  If you're an Austen fan and you've ever fantasied about meeting your Mr. Darcy, this book is for you. You will be able to relate to Jane completely and step into her shoes to enjoy the wild ride to find herself and true happiness.

B0043A0PXU|5.0|To the handful of haters, there is always 'The Carpenter's Christmas Collection', Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas' or maybe even Enya has something out. For those of us who like to remain AWAKE at Christmas, there is Annie Lennox's latest release!    This is very exciting Christmas music, the lyrics being sung with strength and clarity.  Entire choirs completely made up of the voice of Annie Lennox...now that's what I call celestial! Lennox said this work is very close to her heart and it shows. Like always, each track is very original, despite being traditional. That is Annie Lennox. You never know what she will come up with next. She is extremely unpredictable.     This CD has it all; the soft and beautiful ('In The Bleak Midwinter' and 'Silent Night') to the intensely exciting 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman' and 'Angels in the Real of Glory', and everything in between.     It appears that this CD is not for everyone, however.  This is for those with, shall we say, more \\"progressive ears\\" who welcome new ideas and versions of all things traditional.     NOTE:  The Amazon audio samples do not do the album justice. They don't capture the best parts of the actual body of work. When you play the whole CD it has a totally different feel.

B002KVCA1O|5.0|When I saw that Amazon had this album priced at $2.99 I was wondering what was wrong with it. The album cover is pretty lame and I really didn't know of the existence of this album. The following comes from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones and was initially released worldwide, except in North America, in 1993. The North American release came on 24 August 2004.<br /><br />The first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the Compact Disc era, Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones stretches from 1971's Sticky Fingers to then-most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989.<br /><br />The very first release under their contract with Virgin Records in November 1993 (while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded), Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones reached #16 in the UK and became an enduring seller. Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at #30 and go platinum.<br /><br />In 2009 Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones was remastered and reissued by Universal Music.<br /><br />As this MP3 compilation shows a release date of August 18, 2009 (which is the same date as the latest version CD that Amazon is selling) I would believe that this is the latest remaster as it sounds great. It is an exceptional value for the price that Amazon is charging for it at the present time.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|When I saw the midnight showing of \\"Inception\\" one of the previews that came on was for a little movie called \\"The Town.\\" By the end of the explosive preview the whole theater was buzzing about what they just saw.

Most people have their opinions on the movie but the blu ray is what is really special. The Blu ray includes a 30 minute longer extended edition. Any one who has read Chuck Hogan's \\"Prince of Thieves\\" (The book that the movie is loosely based on) will enjoy the extended scenes that mirror parts in the book better than the theatrical release. I enjoy watching the extended edition because it really feels like a different movie, unlike Avatar, which only added 8 minutes of CGI porn into the theaters.<br /><br /> To be honest I think that the regular theatrical edition flows better than the extended one. The audio is top notch, the second heist scene and car chase that follows really sounds amazing. And the picture is clear enough that you can see Ben's 5-o'clock shadow perfectly. Over all a good movie, great disc that offers a longer, ( longer ) edition. Well recommended
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I have been a P!nk fan for years; kind of actually forgotten how long ago she really started until getting this album and hearing the first few songs on it.  I have the Funhouse CD, so I already have all those songs, but still love to hear them all again.  Raise your Glass is such a catchy new song, I just love it.  I haven't watched the entire DVD that came with this yet, just briefly popped it in the player to see what it was all about, loved it. Loved watching P!nk change thru the years, forgot about the really short bright pink hair she used to have when she started.  I love her style, love her videos, they are so funny.  If you like P!nk, do not hesitate to buy this album, you won't be disappointed!
0061743526|5.0|Though I haven't bought this on Amazon.com, I still want to leave a review for this product.  This book is one of the best I've ever read, and the 50th anniversary hardcover edition is the best way to celebrate this masterpiece.  The paperbacks I got in school didn't do it justice.  I can't wait to reread this great work of literature!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|There are a handful of complaints about this movie and to a certain degree I may agree. It is not really a movie for the young as it is pretty scary at times.   But the 3D version is done beautifully. You could almost feel the snow hitting your face. It is very dark visually (at least on my 65\\" Mitsubishi DLP TV played on the excellent Panasonic DMP-BDT350 blu-ray player).  With not too many 3D movies available right now, this to me is a showcase video for a 3D system. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. It will become a holiday classic.
B0046B1KHG|3.0|To be perfectly fair, my 5 yr old son and his 5 yr old friend loved this movie. I only give it an \\"ok\\" because I was looking forward to it making ME laugh with some extra humor for the adult crowd as well. It was cute either way. :)
B0042816YK|1.0|great movies, are the ones you just LOVE watching again and again. This was not a movie I would watch a second time. It was downright BORING. Couldn't bring across the essence it was trying to display. No warmth in it. Really hopeless. This one should be filed under rotten tomato
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This album is not bad at all- as a matter of fact it's pretty good. Of course it's not the same Mariah as her first great Christmas album but it's pretty damn close-don't listen to all these hate reviews.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|I have to say, I am so impressed with how quickly this DVD was delivered to me! In less than 3 days of ordering I received it in the mail. I am still waiting on another order I placed on December 9th to deliver but I am amazed at how quickly this arrived. Excellent seller!
0061989142|5.0|If you've been around the style block, this book may be a bit repetitive. However, for someone in their late teens and early twenties, this book has a great amount of helpful information. It's packaged in a gorgeous glossy book. The clothes stand out on the white pages, and I especially loved the chapter on jeans. As a petite like Lauren, all of her information on tailoring was extremely helpful. She gives great advice for pulling off the classy feminine style she is famous for.
030746363X|5.0|Just finished my first read, and I'll be taking a second pass with a notebook to draft a plan... First up? Muscle gain + abs + Ice Baths. Oh and no more cellphone in my pocket!
0061537969|5.0|This book is funny, moving, thought provoking and as beautifully written as the concept deserves. Thank God for an author so deeply inlove with his subject and  the subject matter. This book is perfect!
0061766089|4.0|The reviews here capture the two sides of this book.      I really liked it as a quick, breezy, thought provoking read.      It is lacking in applied detail.  It does not take a case study approach.  It can be thin soup.      It is a high level look at basic design principles leavened with some examples (though not linear process oriented ones).      It is indeed part sales pitch or puff piece, but there are creative sparks to be found as well.  Nothing groundbreaking but pithy and well targeted.
B000ASATYO|5.0|This movie is incredibly fun. There's just something about it that I've always loved and it never fails to entertain, no matter how many times I watch it. Everyone in the cast is great, from Michael J. Fox to the creepy old lady. The story is wonderful, focusing on a hustler who can see earthbound spirits and uses his relationship with them to con people into thinking he's some sort of ghostbuster...until he gets caught up in a series of murders committed by one ghost disgusing itself as a grim reaper.<br /><br />The film has just the right mix of creepy horror, quirky comedy and drama. If you are looking for gratuitous gore, this is not the film for you as there is very little blood. But for those of us who are more interested in the story and simply being entertained by a wacky cast of misfits on one hell of a ectoplasmic adventure, this is an amazing movie that is not to be missed and can be enjoyed again and again by a huge range of viewers, regardless of your usual tastes. Definitely one of my genre favorites; highly recommended!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I loved this movie alot. I would recommend this movie to people I know and to people I don't know. Jim Carey was great as usual.
006145205X|4.0|The author discusses several different aspects of the condition of Humanity - population, economy, food supply, etc.  He lays these out in the framework of a theory that Humanity is exceptional in the animal kingdom.  We are exceptional in that we specialize and adapt to change in ways that animals do not.  As such, we will adapt to changes and create solutions to the problems that arise in the world.  Because of this, it is in our best interests to allow the process to continue without external controls and interference.  To a degree, the author soulds less like a scientist and more like a libertarian economist. He supports the proposition that humans can solve their own problems and that individuals will find those solutions - not governments.  The best solutions will thrive while the suboptimal will fall by the wayside.  The proposal apperas similar to the 'survival of the fittest' or a social Darwinism, but the proposal is positive and optimistic.  The relationship of Humanity and the world is like classical economics - a self-correcting system.    The author supports his arguments like a scientist, citing both anecdotal and statistical data to support his conclusion.  He spends a lot of time discussing the situation in Africa and the issue of climate change.  He tends to see human adaptiveness and ingenuity as the solution to human problems and he has a lot of highly justified faith in the ability of Humanity to solve these problems.    At times, the writing is a bit dense, but he is generally very readable.  He does not assume a high level of pre-requisite knowledge, and he explains his case examples and his principles clearly.  It is interesting, but a bit hard to read at times.
B0035V35PI|2.0|Nowadays, every karate or Wuxia style film is continually trying to show more blood, and intense severings of people's arms and legs, and even the smooth slicing of half of someone's head right through the middle of their face.<br /><br />What some people might find horrifying, I thought was comical and extremely unrealistic.  But, bloodshed is bloodshed, and some people, I guess, just can't get enough.<br /><br />I understand that Rain is a popular Korean singer and really knows how to swoon the women.  I wonder what Korean women think of him now?  Could they look past the killing and the bloodshed and still love him?
0735619670|4.0|As a beginner programmer, you might want to read this in your better interest. As 3 years programmer like me, this good helps me very little. If you graph the helpfulness of this book you will get y = 1/x (restrict x >= 0) where y = helpfulness, and x = time you spent programming.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|First of all, I will say that I gave this movie four stars for the movie.  But, this review was written on the complaint of the release of the unsuspecting un-playability of the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />I have a Sony Blu-Ray Player, and this Blu-Ray disc of \\"Starship Troopers\\" is released by Sony.  But, guess what?  This Sony Blu-Ray player will not play this Sony Blu-ray disc.  I understand that I'm suppose to go out a buy a flash drive for my Sony Blu-Ray Player to play this movie.<br /><br />I gotta buy a flash drive just to play one movie?  How stupid is that?!  The movie doesn't even say on the box that I will be required to buy a flash drive if I want to watch this movie.  No wonder there were so many of these copies of \\"Starship Troopers\\" in the used BD bin at the used CD store.<br /><br />First Sony creates a wonderful CD burning program called ATRAC and SonicStage.  When I get nearly my whole CD library condensed to just a boxful of 33 hour CDR's, they discontinue the program so that I will not be able to burn anymore ATRAC CDR's, or buy another ATRAC CDR player in the future.<br /><br />Now, they release movies on Blu-Ray that you will not be allowed to play unless you buy a flash drive.  So, I guess this BD version of \\"Starship Troopers\\" returns to the used BD rack at the record store with the rest of them.<br /><br />Well that's it!  I will never buy another Sony product again.  They are just too inconsistent with what people will embrace with their product, and will then discontinue it without a damn that people have added their unique technology to their lifestyle, as that of their SonicStage program.  And I will not waste money on a flash drive since my DVD of \\"Starship Troopers\\" looks just fine anyway.<br /><br />Live and learn!
0740797719|5.0|Everyone I know who is an artist either has this book and loves it or is pining to get their own copy as soon as possible. It's a beautiful book with excellent information. The information is professional-grade but is explained in terms that amateur and beginning artists will also easily understand the concepts.    Incidentally, this would also be highly suitable book for intelligent kids who are interested in art. Gurney's way of breaking down each observation or technique into one or two pages of information, combined with beautiful artwork and visual examples, should keep even the shortest attention span hooked. Plus, there's many of his classic paintings of dinosaurs, too.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|The animation and character design were a mixed bag at best, and seem to be a step back from BEOWULF, Zemekis' last Mo-Cap feature. Backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the figures are very stiff, and many are oddly proportioned, existing in a weird gray area between realistic and cartoon anatomy.     Note to the \\"too scary for kids\\" crowd - IT'S A GHOST STORY - read the source. The movie got that mostly right.     As someone who is a great fan of Dickens' story and was really looking forward to this adaptation, it was a huge disappointment.
B00008PX8P|3.0|Disc #2 skiped liked crazy....and also, whats w/the cheezy shots? Instead of just watchin Zep do the tunes why was it necessary to add the stupid effects? Ruins the vid totally.But anyway, b careful, i sent it back today.....25 bucks and it skipped all over the place..C'mon Amazon, get it together or this is 1 customer u will lose
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great book like the rest of his books !!1 Starts off slow and every chapter you can tell it is building up and you just cant put it down !! When all the chapters finally come to together in the last 10 chapters you will be well rewarded !!!    Must read, must buy
B002QW7AJY|5.0|Pandorum is a paranoia inducing, terrifyingly dark science fiction film with an important message behind it.  Visually the film is quite stunning, from the claustrophobic crawl spaces to the futuristic looking bridge of the ship. Everything looks as it should be. The plot of the film is easy enough to understand if you were paying attention. I won't give anything away but I will say that I think the overall message of the film is how humans often sabotage themselves.    Rating: 9 out of 10
B002ZG994U|4.0|I watched the tv show when I was a kid and I have to say, initially I was very disappointed in the movie. I won't give away to much but the movie shows the beginnings of the A-team but as the movie goes along, it almost becomes a quagmire of a narrative. Almost in that they (the writers) manage to bring it to a satisfactory ending. The story could have been better and there I'll give it 3 out of 5 stars. However, the movie makes up for the okay story with plenty of action which I give it a 4.5 out of 5. From a high speed chase in Baghdad to the A-Team trying to fly a tank after they are shot down. All of the actors did a pretty good job but Murdock was by far the best of the four. He added a huge amount of comedy to the movie (5 out of 5) and at times, will have you rolling at his antics. I'd say the movie's worth 20 dollars and under so get it on normal dvd or used.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Despite choosing [[ASIN:B000BQ7J6Q Santa's Slay]] as this years Christmas B selection we were moved to pull a little extra holiday cheer out of the midget sized stocking by making a patent Sid double feature. Since there was a good hour and a half before kickoff on Sunday we figured why not participate in one more holiday review and get ourselves off the naught list by Spreading Joy (oh yeah oh yeah I think you will like it). As our second entry we decided to go with the cult classic 1974 legit horror Black Christmas. Despite it being legit it was still brimming with B, and the fact that it's a very overlooked horror film only adds a lot of allure for the Sid brothers.<br /><br />The film takes place almost entirely in a sorority house that's plagued by some really creepy phone pranks. Now these aren't the harmless type Arnold or Hansen type soundboard pranks that everybody (except the Rubenator) just can't get enough of, these a full blown perved out pranks. IT sounded like short studd was on the other end of this phone telling these chicks to get down on the floor. However the calls are only the beginning of the trouble for this house on unshaven 70's foxes. Turns out this freakshow is hiding in their attic looking to pick them off one by one. Yeah that's some serious stuff right there.<br /><br />On a serious not Black Christmas was a really creepy horror flick for the most part. Sure there were some lulls where you just wanted to speed things up a bit, but we get they're trying to build the suspense. It was probably the first movie to use the old \\"the killer is calling from inside your house\\" routine which probably blew peoples giant 70's mustaches off back then. It seems a bit morbid to watch a Christmas movie that's all about some freakshow serial killer, but we do it for the love of B. We know the old boy Santa won't think any less of us since viewing all genres of B is in our job description. So if you're looking for a break from the typical yule tide cheer then pop in Black Christmas and remember what we use to do to you.ck Christmas and remember what we use to do to you.

030746363X|5.0|I'm about half way through Tim's new book and am loving it. I gave up a good chunk of my weekend for reading. And if you think a book like this, written by someone Tim's age is not for older people, think again. I'm a 68 year old woman who has followed Tim since the early 4HWW days. So if you want to be on the cutting edge, and you're over 50 or 60 or 70, I promise you there's something here for you.<br />One of the reasons I like Tim and people like him is the sense of adventure and the willingness to try new things. I moved from Youngstown, Ohio to Philadelphia last summer, driving the biggest U-Haul truck and towing my car -- alone. Adventure is a great thing...<br />There are a lot of things in this book that anyone can use -- and some, like bench-pressing 400 pounds -- that I, for one, will never try! But I'm going to get a Kettlebell and add that to my exercise routine -- along with other exercise tips that are new to me. And the eating/diet information was very solid. I had already read Gary Taubes \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" so knew about this information, but Tim presents it really well for someone who is new to it. The concept of thinking in terms of \\"fat loss\\" instead of \\"weight loss\\" opens all kinds of doors that people in my age group were never exposed to.<br />I could go on, but that's enough. I need to get back to my couch and finish the book! From Meredith in Philly.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I read the comics and saw the German version of the movie at a theatre. It was hilarious!   But the English one has much more details, even large parts of the dialogues are taken 1:1 from the comics.     The effects serve their purpose, and seriously...if you have played any sort of videogame in the '90s or as a kid, you will love this movie.    Go and get it!     The DVD version doesn't have as many extra features as the Blu Ray one, so if you want to have the whole deal of pilgrimage, you should buy it on Blu Ray.
B001O54NKS|4.0|Dokken is one of the best Metal bands to come out of the all to short period from 1985 to about 1987 when Hip-Hop pushed it aside. Of all the bands that broke from the LA scene to world acclaim, Dokken had more talent, a better sound and fresher music than all but maybe Queensryche. This is one of their best albums - especially the cuts 'In My Dreams' and 'Don't Lie to Me'. Get it and ROCK out!!!
030746363X|5.0|I have read through almost the entire book and am BIG time impressed with the hard hitting content in this book. For the sale price of just under $14 I have NO clue how anyone can complain.<br /><br />The information found regarding training for sprinters, training for long distance running and the High Intensity Training are ALL golden in my opinion.<br /><br />This book definitely appeals more for the individual looking to push the envelope of physical potential and is less suited for the guy who is only moderately interested in changing his body and overall performance.<br /><br />To have this large amount of legit information gathered into one book is straight up awesome and I can't recall the last time something like this was ever done for retail book stores. The chapters on strength, stamina, mobility / flexibility, speed and muscle building are from legit Coaches and even come with step by step programs to follow that can teach everyone a lot, not just fitness fanatics, but personal trainers and strength coaches as well.<br /><br />I don't think this book would be that exciting for someone like my Dad who is in his early 60s, but, for men in their 20s through 50s I think this will light a serious fire under their ass, especially if they are looking to get that extra edge in any physical activity / sport.<br /><br />It would be very cool to see late teenagers reading this book as well, applying some of the training methods rather than the typical stuff found on magazine racks.<br /><br />Track & Field Coaches, Football Coaches, Powerlifters, Bodybuilders and Martial Artists - I believe there is something for everyone, even if is not directly addressed towards YOU, there is LOTS of learning to be had through these Coaches and the countless experiments Tim put himself through.<br /><br />I created an entire video review on my blog as well, as this book is kick ass 100% in my opinion, but, it is not for the half hearted individual who doesn't want to push the boundaries of health, fitness and human performance.<br /><br />For such a cheap price though, I can't see how anyone can go wrong and I laugh at those crying and complaining about a book with all this powerful info which only cost them $14.<br /><br />Here is my video regarding my thoughts on this book and some time spent chatting with Tim Ferriss<br /><br />[...]For such a cheap price though, I can't see how anyone can go wrong and I laugh at those crying and complaining about a book with all this powerful info which only cost them $14.

B00192IV9U|4.0|You be the judge...For me it could very well become a classic.We know Michael wasn't around to have the final say,but the songs have Michael written all over them.From beginning to end the songs are fun and well written as all of his past treasures.Hold My Hand w/Akon,Hollywood Tonight,Keep Your Head Up,Monster w/ 50 Cent,Breaking News,(I Can't Make It)Another Day w/Lenny Kravitz and Much Too Soon are my faves on the album.Future classics are very possible.I know some of them I really like and have listened to them over and over.If you have been a fan of Michael since he was a kid,why stop at this one.It is a great tribute to Michael and I actually hope this is his last.They should let this be his final album...Let him go out on top.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is one of the most insightful movies I have seen recently.  The reality of dreams comes alive in a fantastic new way, that of introducing the concept of limbo and how one's dreams connect to different levels of conscience.  The movie also introduces the concept of \\"construction\\" of places by third parties in one's dreams and how to make the \\"psychic\\" connection to these places in such a way that the dreamer releases deeply hidden information that can be exploited.  This movie is well acted and one of the best I have seen recently and requires two or more viewings to gain the full impact because you have no clue what is going on in the first thirty minutes.  For that it is worth twice to three times as much as other movies because the thought process itself brings forth new possibilities for exploiting new movie twists and turns.  An incredibly cleverly conceived package that begs to be added to your personal library!
B003H9MSPG|4.0|when i got the gun it was pretty cool like after assembleing it or whatever and the only thing that i have to say about this gun is that the gun doesnt fire as much as i thought it would, like it woulnd probably shoot as far as a maverick or something stronger than that, like the firepower to it is somewhat decent and can shoot pretty well. the barrel attachment on the gun is too big for the nerf bullet so instead of what they say of being more acurate, it actually doesnt let it goe as far so instead i had to get pvc piping and put it in the barrel and it worked way better and shot more accurately
B001I82RU4|1.0|i returned this item because im looking for the CD not the record and i have yet to get my refound i better get it soon or you will get a call from my lawer.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I should have read other product reviews before purchasing this item.  Although my wife and I love the show, we ran into multiple cases where the discs in this set were defective.  The skipping is pretty common and many episodes are either unplayable or impossible to watch.  I suggest finding another way to purchase seasons of Will & Grace, because I doubt you'll be happy with this complete series option.
030746363X|5.0|I just got Tim's new book and stayed up until 3:00 am reading it.  I really appreciate his writing style, full of both humor and detail, as well as his willingness to use himself as a human guinea pig.  No matter what your beliefs, it's fascinating reading.  I'm starting the Slow Carb diet today.  We'll see how it goes.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|There were parts of this book that were very good, but for most of it I was bored.  The characters were well written,  but I didn't really care about them. Most of the \\"good\\" people were not ones I cared too much about and the \\"bad\\" people were not the kind that you love to hate.  I slogged through the book hoping it would capture me, but it never did.  I was hoping for another \\"Pillars of Earth\\", but did not find it.  If you are interested in the period around WWI, you may like this.  It holds no particular interest to me. I will probably try the next in the series, but really don't recommend this one.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|The wait is over for all of us  with Otterbox on our iPhones and iPods.  The dockStubz Charge Converter and 30-pin Pass Through Adapter is what we all wanted and needed.  This adapter will fit and charge the iPhones or iPods.  Now you too can enjoy the docks and accessories that would not connect to the phone or iPod with an Otterbox defender.  If you have an iPhone or iPod with the Otterbox defender then you NEED THIS CHARGE CONVERTER.  Great product.  Had one now I have two.

030726999X|5.0|I am so mad at Stieg Larsson for dying. That man can write! This is the best of the three books. The series is the most interesting set of books I've read in years. Highly recommended.
0307588343|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. Easy to read and full with very interesting stories and anectdotes from the Lehman trenches.   I think most people can relate to at any point in their lives working in a place where management really misses the point in some very important business trends, but the case with Lehman´s top management seemed unheard of. Although the author was certainly not in the real inside as regards with top management (i guess no one could, given Fuld´s rigid grip on the company), the reader gets a very good idea of what the rest of the Lehman employees saw and felt during those terrible last few months.  I highly recommed it!
B0034G4OVS|2.0|It's a good conversational piece.  And it is shot nicely to qualify as entertainment and a movie.  So if you accept situations presented to you and you can sustain the belief without asking any nagging questions, then it's a movie to pass time with. But there are certain junctures where the characters made certain decisions that seem to serve stretching a movie out to 90 minutes.  Are these kids just young and inexperienced?  For the amount of times one boy boasts of experiences from the past semesters, we are to believe they are college kids.  But either the quality of college education isn't what it used to be, or the Darwin awards are at work here.<br /><br />I watched this movie with two 40-something guys, and they were basically tearing their hair out throughout the movie.  There's no sense of urgency at advancing nightfall, frostbite, hypothermia.  When the sun is up and it is warm, people chat and talk.  Decisions are made to act only near night time when the mercury drops.  Jackets are not zipped all the way to the top, up to the full length of the zippers.  Hands are left bare, out in the open, when they should be tucked inside to retain warmth.  People should cuddle to sustain body heat. None of this takes place.<br /><br />If I knew it was going to be five more days before the resort opened.  I would say \\"everyone, take off your jackets and pants  (they are the tough synthetic material ski apparel are made from these days that don't rip easily).  Tie it end-to-end and let one person slide halfway down the makeshift \\"rope\\" to the bottom.  Take a leap, tuck-and-roll.  Pull the shirts / pants back up, put the clothing on, throw the guy his clothes on the bottom, and the guy goes for help. End of story.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|I liked most all of The Town; well-acted for the most part, nice tight script, and Affleck showing more acting chops than usual (ok, not exactly a Herculean task). He also helms this one pretty well; it's clear he's seen plenty of cop and heist flicks, and works with their tropes pretty well. If you love gun porn, there's no shortage here.<br /><br />But gee whiz, must we be treated/subjected to sooo many ennndless shots of Concerned Ben and Confused Ben and all the other deeply taciturn Bens walking down the street, staring into space from a chair, or otherwise being as quasi-Brandoesque as he can manage? Affleck clearly thinks Affleck is one of the hottest guys around, so we're treated to looong shots of Affleck, over and over. Cut those and this 125 minute movie is suddenly maybe 105, with a lot more edge and impact. As much as I enjoyed many scenes here, it all dragged a fair bit at parts and that really lessened the power for me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's a solid heist/good cop/standard doomed romance flick, with a good blu-ray transfer, and well worth seeing for fans of those genres. There's definitely a large Heat influence, which is not so bad as that's one of the best of this genre. And if you love looking at Ben Affleck as much as Ben Affleck does, then you will absolutely adore this movie. And Ben. He's not only cute, but he's so deeeeep. You can almost feel the existential suffering. Almost.
B0000CDJPQ|2.0|I wanted to use this device for connecting a firewire sound card to my Macbook Pro (OS 10.5).   The sound that comes out of the card was garbled and distorted. So I tried something else.    I tried to use it to connect a DV video camera to my Macbook, so that I could rip the footage into Final Cut Pro.   Final Cut could not detect the camera, nor could it capture video.    Both the sound card and the camera are in working order, and serve me well when connected to my PowerPC G5. The Sonnet FireWire 400 to 800 Adapter, however, has failed in every critical way.   I hope that another device can succeed where this one has failed.    Two stars because it actually produced some sound from my Firewave, though it was totally unlistenable. It wasn't completely dead, just inadequate.

030746363X|2.0|this book is just way too long, 90% of the material are things people simply wouldn't try and have no real application in everyday life. When you make the silly claims he makes...you know its all about selling a book and nothing else.  Pass on this one!!
0679601953|5.0|Purchased for my daughter and her school needs (she is home shcooled) and she was very happy with the book, not to mention that the business end was a pleasure and easy to do as well. Would highly recommend.  Fraze
B004856SQ8|5.0|While I hated the TV show and it's \\"one story told a million times\\" type of scripts, and being another old show rehash, I didn`t expect much... but I really enjoyed this film. It's more serious, with still a touch of humor and lots of action.
B003UESJHO|4.0|Well, it is finally here, The Fighter rings in (pardon the pun) with solid acting by the entire cast.Who can deney Christian Bale's dedication to the Role of Dick Eklund who's claim to fame was a championship bout with Sugar Ray?Like him or hate him, most all remeber Bale's temper tantrum from the set of T4 that was highly publisized and ridiculed.     You cannot deney the endless well of tallent that Bale brings to the screen and to his character. Not many have gone to the physical extremes as Bale has.Only an elite few such as Robert Deniro {Raging Bull},Charlize Theron {Monster} and even Sylvester Stallone {Cop Land}.From wasting away in \\"The Mechinist\\" to bulking up to a heafty 220 pounds for his Batman rolls, Bale again  sheds a good 50 pounds (or more) and submerges himself into the roll of Dicky as an unpredictable, crack addicted would be boxing champion.     Mark Walberg also puts in an equal effort as Micky Ward, Dicky's half brother. Torn between chasing the dream that passed his brother by due to his addiction,and to his family and mother who also doubles as his manager, he struggles through one bad fight after another for a shot at a championship.Not until his girlffriend gets him to get the courage to break away from his dysfunctional family and for another go at boxing with new management.    After a stint in jail, Dicky comes clean and the two brothers(differences aside) make for the ring again for what will be Ward's biggest fight in his career,his last shot at anything besides being a \\"stepping stone\\" to other fighters. Great story telling and superb acting makes this boxing drama stand on its own that is both equally moving and uplifting as previous boxing classics like Cinderella Man,Raging Bull and Rocky.    The fighter will have your attention from start to finish as it wastes no time submerging you into the bumpy life of Micky Ward and his steady climb to sucess. This film has had Oscar rumors mentioned, and I wouldn't be surprised in Christian Bale and Mark Walberg are not up for Oscar nominations as are other supporting actors of this film.Well deserved for its mention,but more importantly well worth seeing on the big screen.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Sensory overload. An amazing bundle of goods for a decent price.  I'm not even going to mention how many times I've seen this movie..............I don't even know.  Amazing stuff.
0887308589|5.0|Forget all of the management enthusiast and leadership skill building books out there this one tops them all. It provides the funny side into having the view of the management practices and principles engaged by the most avid or discerning manager within your work environment. Definitely a must get if you are a Dilbert collector and enthusiast.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Seriously.  At least twice throughout the book I was so shocked, that my heart stopped.  I've never had that thrill while reading a book; I say this as an avid reader.  Angels and Demons, as well as, The DaVinci Code were both great but I wouldn't compare The Lost Symbol to either.  It is a different experience although it still holds some of the same Characteristics of the previous two in the trilogy.  $3.00 is a steal!
159448385X|5.0|This was bought as a gift to go along with the previous work from the same writer \\"The Kite Runner\\" and was told it was a great gift idea and a wonderful collection that would be read many times over as the stories come close to showing both the strength and weakness of humanity across its borders.

0375831002|5.0|Amazing book! I purchased this book as a gift after falling in live with it myself. Well developed plot, great characters, moving narrative. I highly recommend The Book Thief.
0307454541|5.0|4 words: I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!  I first heard of this author and his books AFTER I watched the movie based from his novels by the same title, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I watched the original foreign film.  I loved the movie so much that I decided to start reading his novels. I bought the first of the series from Amazon and LOVED IT.  I love Stieg Larsson's way of writing and how he portrays his characters and their lives.  Once I read the first book, I was hooked. I had to get the second. I'm reading it now and will buy the third book.  These books are wonderful. I really love Stieg Larsson as an author.  I'm really sad that he has passed away. I would have loved to read more of his books. I'm sure he would have cranked out more bestsellers!!<br /><br />AWESOME AWESOME BOOK!!!  I highly recommend it!
030746363X|5.0|My beloved hero Tim Ferriss' new book, \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" is out.   Anyone interested in geniusly short-cutted bulking up, skinnying down, marathoning, swimming, sleep-optimizing, holding your breath underwater for 3 minutes, 15 minute female orgasms  :) !!!, or other examples of extraordinary superhuman feats, get this.  As a fan of integrative medicine, I was delighted to see tons of info on supplementation, detox., optimizing health,  etc.  Truly, no book out there like this.    Although I think there is some gratuitous name-dropping for street cred, I think it is sheerly for marketing purposes and not out of hubris.  And, he does know these people.  Ferriss comes across as a genuine, excited-about-life, excited-to-share, caring human with bad case of OCD that benefits him and us thanks to his kindness.  In my quest for recovering health from illness, I have come across many of the nutritional and exercise concepts he introduces, and I believe he is working with some of the finest ideas out there, none being perfect or globally applicable, in my opinion.    He is faulted for using a small trial population (umm, 1, for the most part), but I have no issues with this.  I've taken several drugs with randomized double blind studies and FDA approval that almost killed me.   In this world, we are all our own guinea pigs.  Caveat emptor.  For ALL things you put in or do with your body.  His conclusions are aligned with many other antectodal accounts I have heard for the handful of techniques I am familiar with.  Good enough for me.    He is also faulted for writing style.  Granted, there's some rambling.  But I personally enjoy his mixed storytelling and instruction-cramming writing.     One gripe: and I've had it with the blog a few times.  With the sex and partner advice, I do not like the cold calculation/technique application thing.  And I do not like the glamourized edge (although I understand this is another aspect of his branding).    I am a romantic......    But still, I can admit, many a romance would be improved by some of his information.  So, thank god for this personal possiblity analyst extraordinaire.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I am actually shocked that I liked this movie!  I love Sherlock Holmes and genuinely love the Sherlock Holmes character written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In this new Sherlock Holmes movie, the director has decided to portray Sherlock in a completely different way than the originial beloved Sherlock we know!  Despite this change in Sherlock's character/portrayal, I still loved this movie. It had alot of action in it and it kept my interest.  Although I liked this movie, I still think I will keep with the original Sherlock Holmes. :)
B0047A72E6|5.0|This is my 4th Buddy Guy album it it doesn't contain 1 repeat song. :D  Mr. Guy was born to play the blues. Great mix too!
B0049D1TCM|4.0|I eagerly anticipated this CD.  I really liked what I was hearing coming from this \\"new artist\\" Nicki Minaj.  I must admit I love the majority of this album which is a rare thing for me. Normally I only like 2 or 3 songs from an album and that's it.  This time I only DISLIKE 2 and LOVE all the other songs. I got the Deluxe Edition which has 16 songs on it.      My favorite songs are Dear Nicki, Right Thru Me, Your Love, Super Bass, and I'm the Best. In my opinion, I think Nicki is an awesome rapper. She brings interest to her music and lyrics with her different personas and I am just really liking her music right now. I'd recommend this album. You either love it or hate it! I love it!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Doctor Who is one of my hubby's favorite television series of all time - even going back to the original series from the 70s. We absolutely had to buy this newest season for a Christmas present.
0312330537|3.0|I thought this book had a lot of potential. I actually started reading this book while travelling in India so loved all the references and anecdotes about India. However, somewhere in the middle of the book, it wasn't about India anymore and turned into this far fetched action movie. I did find the author very pretentious in his references to Lin (himself), fluent in Hindi and Maharathi, expert in martial arts, philosopher, poet and genuine super hero. Meanwhile, he is working for the mafia. The long winded poet descriptions got very tiresome and the plot became very predictable. Overall, it was an interesting read but I was so happy to not have to read it anymore by the end.
030746363X|5.0|This book is full of actionable information. It's a fun, exciting, and educational read. Try it just once - you'll enjoy it.
0385533829|4.0|Lovely pictures and an interesting story. I found the historical information interesting, the mystery part was not (obviously) as good as Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code. Nice book though! Good seller, it arrived promptly!
0778328821|4.0|This book was in the condition it was said to be in and arrived on time. I'd definitely buy from this seller again.
B00005T7I1|5.0|When I first found out that this movie was finally on DVD I knew I had to go get it.  \\"Dick Tracy\\" is a first rate action comedy classic with an all star cast that brings comic book characters to life in this entertaining spectacle that's fun for the entire family.  As an active movie goer myself, after seeing it for the first time as a kid with my mom and my cousin it's still a joy to watch even after all these years.  Looking back on that fun time in my life I was a big fan of the \\"Dick Tracy\\" franchise; so much so that I even got some of the action figures like \\"Dick Tracy\\" his partner Sam Catch Em' and of course Big Boy and one of his gangsters.  And who can forget the Nintendo game and the Loony Toonish cartoon that followed the release of the live action film.  Those were the days.     The film takes place in the long and forgotten era of the 1930's where sleek long hooded antic cars, extravagant suits and lavish party dresses were the exception and the outlawed necessity of the Tommy gun set against the backdrop of crime ridden streets was the rule of a menacing criminal element.  The story follows the tense and sometimes romantic exploits of its hero, top cop detective Dick Tracy as he struggles to rid the city he has vowed to protect from the vice like grip of terror orchestrated by a belligerent and cunning mob boss known throughout the city as, \\"Big Boy\\" as he and his thugs launch a crime wave of racketeering, intimidation and murder.  When the call comes over his wrist watch radio Detective Tracy is always on hand to answer it no matter where he is or what he's caught up in the middle of.  It doesn't matter whether he's at the Opera or having a touching conversation with his love interest when duty calls Dick has to go.  Actor and Director Warren Beatty plays the title roll opposite of Al Pacino who plays his arch nemesis, \\"Big Boy\\".  Both deliver powerhouse performances in this movie, everyone else is also perfectly cast for their unique rolls as theircharacters begin to take on personalities of their own.  Another unique character in this film is one that takes on a double roll throughout the story, \\"Breathless Mahoney\\" played by Madonna is a charming fire cracker of a character who often tries to manipulate Tracy during his investigation, covers Big Boy as the lead singer at a nightclub that his gang has taken over and shadows sinister criminal activities as her alter ego the mysterious \\"Blank\\" a trench coat and top hat dark figure that hides in the back alleys and dark corners lying in wait to spring a surprise attack that leaves those she encounters stumped as to the lone figure's existence.     I agree with what the previous reviewer posted about the film.  This film was made for DVD simply because of the great sound that the stereo produces during some of the more action packed sequences in the movie such as, shoot outs, drive by shootings and a car bombing.  In all, this film has something for everybody.  A great storyline, character dialogue and development along with a good film score and soundtrack.  For those who might worry about what their kids might get out of this film, this isn't your typical cop drama as opposed to some of the more violent films that have preceded it.  There's very little in the way of foul language, graphic violence or censored sex.  If anything its one of the more tame cop movies that's actually come out over the years and it makes for a great flick for the whole family to sit down and enjoy.  As far as the DVD itself, I would have liked to have seen some behind the scenes features and cast interviews because it's always interesting to see how something that's now a classic got put together in the first place.  For the critics I'll give this film a 9/10 but definitely worth the time to watch.
1608870081|5.0|My 6 year old little boy loves this book. He is thrilled to have something Harry Potter. He takes the book in the car and to his brother's karate class. He also has a Harry action figure and he pretends Harry is coming out the of the book. This book is one that will delight a child for some time. I highly recommend it.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|\\"Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. \\"Mankind.\\" That word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: \\"We will not go quietly into the night!\\" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!\\"<br />[crowd cheers]<br /><br />Probably my favorite speech in American History.  Barack has nothing on Bill Pullman.  Not only did he give such a rousing speech, but then he flew the f'ing fighter jet against the Aliens!  What other president would have that kind of moxie?  This movie is an absolute gem.  Will Smith's career has only gone downhill from this 1996 peak and can you even name a recent Jeff Goldblum movie?  Most likely these stars were typecast in these roles and for good reason.  If you like America, you need to own this movie.  That is all.
B004B4RCDE|5.0|I really like the album. My favorite track is \\"Man Down\\". The best reggae song she ever sang. I also like skin and Cheers
076115728X|5.0|This book has been great in teaching my preschooler that things don't have to be \\"perfect\\" to be beautiful.  It's creative, fun, and colorful.  The message of the book can be turned into several different lessons for kids:<br /><br />-An \\"OOPS\\" isn't a reason to cry, but a chance to make something great<br />-Things can still be beautiful even with \\"flaws\\"<br />-Everyone has \\"OOPS\\", nobody is perfect<br /><br />It's a short book that only takes a couple of minutes to read.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great book that I'd recommend to anyone with a budding perfectionist at home.  :)
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I have always loved the book \\"The Polar Express,\\" so when the movie came out I was excited to see it. This year I finally bought the DVD because my daughter (3) is old enough to really be excited about Christmas.    The visuals in this movie are stunning. The music is beautiful. The plot is basically the same as the book (boy who worries he is getting too old to believe in Santa goes on a midnight train ride to the North Pole on Christmas Eve) with some extras thrown in to fill out the movie's run time. Some of the new scenes are excellent (the \\"hot chocolate\\" dance) others are a bit of a miss (caribou on the track? okay) but overall the movie is fantastic.    I was worried parts of it would be too startling/scary for my daughter, especially since she has not seen a lot of TV or movies, but overall she loved it. I would not let her watch it alone but with me there to laugh off some of the scarier moments (tense moments where the train almost crashes, a scene where the main character almost falls off the ladder on the outside of the train) she enjoyed it. I am sure it will be a family favorite for years to come.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Well, first off, This album is very well produced. It is beautiful, in almost every way. Glenn and K.K. are just as amazing here as when I first heard Dissident Aggressor. Alot of people are comparing this to Lochness from Angel of Retribution, and calling it \\"just as bad\\". Well let me correct you tards, Lochness was one of the best songs on AoR and that whole album was a great comeback for priest.<br /><br />But I won't ramble about how people can't handle change in someone's usual style. Instead I will say \\"Exiled\\" is the best song on the album even though every song on the album is wonderful in almost every way, there is so Much passion in Rob's vocal performance on \\"exiled\\" it really made me feel what was going on, on this album. \\"High Points\\" on this album are everything, Anyone that disagrees can suck a lightbulb.<br /><br />A must have for any true Judas Priest fan~
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Director Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express, Forrest Gump) has scored again with this excellent animated version of Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale.  Jim Carrey stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a crotchety old man who cares nothing about others or the holiday season.  He prefers to spend his time alone in his office or home, sitting in front of the fire.  He also belittles his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman), despite his young son's illness.    On one such evening, Scrooge is in his customary place in front of the fireplace when a ghostly spirit visits him.  The spirit informs Scrooge that he is the Ghost of Christmas Past, and he takes Scrooge on a journey to the Christmases he had as a child and young man.  Scrooge sees where he went to school, and the holiday ball he attended with a girl that later became his wife.  The marriage ended in divorce.  Another spirit, The Ghost of Christmas Present, shows Scrooge the events of the current holiday, including the Cratchit family toasting him for his supplying Bob with a job.  Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Future shows Scrooge close to death, and the town members are rejoicing his passing.  Also, the Cratchits mourn the loss of Tiny Tim.    All of these spirits have a profound effect on Scrooge himself.  Soon, he's singing carols in the street, skating behind carriages, and asking people for forgiveness for the way he treated them in the past.  No one is more surprised at Scrooge's miraculous transformation than Bob Cratchit.      This is an excellent movie.  I've been a Zemeckis fan for years, and my family and I watch \\"The Polar Express\\" every Christmas season.  I'm sure \\"A Christmas Carol\\" will become regular holiday viewing for us, too.  The special effects in the film are astounding, and the story contains a fine moral lesson to be learned.  Make \\"A Christmas Carol\\" part of your regular holiday viewing.  Your family will love it.  Highly recommended.
0060765488|5.0|My son and I just started reading the Chronicles of Narnia series with this book.  We both loved it.  Here is his perspective.  \\"This was a great book.  The characters were very interesting. I love that the animals could talk.  All ages should try this great book.  I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I did.\\"
0435123432|3.0|This is a variant of the epistolary novel, told by letters. Here, the story consists of progress reports made by a man who undergoes and operation to increase intelligence.  The plot involves his adjustement to his intelligence, the reactions of others, and his eventual decline.<br /><br />Originally a science fiction story, winner of the Hugo Award, and basis of a popular film, the story moves along easily, and would be good reading for teens or a young adult. The characters tend to be standard midcentury types--the narcissistic egotistical scientist who plays god with nature, a wonky graduate student, a bohemian blonde artist, and a status oriented but otherwise loveless mother. The theme of intelligence (which Charlie has in great degree as the plot unfolds) and emotion (of which maturity he has little) becomes a central focus of the character development, aided by Freudian type dream sequences, consistent with the psychology at the time of the book's writing. The author does a creditable job of describing the administration of psychological tests (Rorschach, TAT) to Charlie, in both his delayed and his brilliant states.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Very impressive imaging and incredible storylines. It show very well the hell of the pacific theater. This series I could watch over and over again.

B004CUVRF6|5.0|This movie is wonderful! It has a good story, is brilliant and stunning visually and has an amazing soundtrack. So glad I bought it instead of just renting it, I will be watching it again soon!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|The music is  one of the things that make the film special. This soundtrack by Daft Punk is truly a symphony of many different sounds.  My favorite track is \\"Adagio For Tron\\".  This track starts off slow and builds in intensity while maintaining a graceful tone.  I love the violins playing on this song. \\"Nocturne\\" is another beautiful slow track that I enjoy.  \\"Clu\\" and \\"The Game Has Changed\\" are two tracks with a  menacing sounding tone.  \\"Clu\\" is an intense sounding four minutes.  \\"The Game Has Changed\\" also has a powerful beat. I love both tracks. \\"Solar Sailor\\" is a subtle two and a half minutes. This track sounds very soothing to me. I love the upbeat and techno sound of \\"Derezzed\\". This track pumps me up with energy. \\"Outlands\\" has a frantic tone to it. \\"Rinzler\\" has a suspenseful tone to it that is enjoyable to listen to. I really love the variety of tones to this score. The End Titles sound very funky.  It makes me feel more confident for some reason.  The music of Daft Punk is empowering, exciting and serene at certain moments of this soundtrack. I absolutely love every minute of it.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|A must see .... mind blowing, heart warming, nostalgia experience, great discovery for those too young to have lived this period. Each rendering of the Beatle songs is a five star experience in the way they are interpreted... absolutely a must see or buy..

0634049011|5.0|This book was bought early, as I will be doing more scale work after I complete the current project. I got the book on Friday and was immediately sucked in. By Sunday I was able to find a note on the fretboard in seconds AND identify any note on the fretboard in Seconds. Prior to this weekend the area above fret 5 on strings 1 through 4 took me almost 30 seconds per note. Also note I had gone through almost 20 blank fretboard printouts in one weekend.  I have set aside my other project for the last two weeks of this year to make sure I do the exercises in chapters 2-5 daily to ingrain this wonderful stuff in long term memory. I will also be writing things and say things out of my other methods as well. I also plan on returning to this method once my current project is complete (a bit earlier than originally planned).<br />As with all methods I get, I read ahead.  Chapters 1, 3 and 6 are review for me. Even though it was not an issue for me (already knew major scale patterns), I can see the issue with Chapter 7.  There is a jump from major scale pattern on one string to full the major scale patterns across the strings.  Unfortunately, this jump is common to most methods.  The missing step is how to turn the major scale on one string into the 5 common major scale fragments (in order from lowest to highest string VII-I-II, III-IV-V, VI-VI-I, II-III-IV V-VI and back to VII-I-II) and then how to reassemble them (in the order given) to create the 5 scale patterns (same fragment used on strings 1 and 6). By learning fragments first, learning all scales becomes easier to understand and you will learn them faster.<br />I won't be able to tell you about chapters 8 and beyond until sometime next year.  For chapters 1-5 alone BUY THIS BOOK and you get the free bonus of all the other chapters!  I also bought this book (and 100 blank fretboard diagram pages) for my brother who also plays guitar.<br />With this book I highly recommend you find a good blank fretboard diagram page (with multiple diagrams per page) and print out 100 copies. Use these instead of writing in book, that way you can do the exercises multiple times daily until you are ready to move on.tiple diagrams per page) and print out 100 copies.

B0043ISH6O|4.0|The music of Social Network is great, but the entire musical feel of the movie is what made it for me. There are multiple songs or bits of songs used in the movie which are not on the soundtrack and I assume not composed by Reznor/Ross.  I would like to see those songs released or a list,if anyone could post this, of this music.  I hope Trent & co gets an Oscar it is well deserved.
B000005JA8|5.0|R.I.P. Don Glen Vliet aka Don Van Vliet aka CAPTAIN BEEFHEART!  He was humanly born of the WWII stoicism of 1941 (hey, Belushi made a movie by that title!) and grew on wings of music and giant legs of paint striding boldly into the 21st century (Schizoid Man!).  Then on like a madman he charged as a cave-painting of a bull through the evanescent worlds of art, music and pop culture making rock-n-roll records.  Thankfully for us, The Dear Captain crafted music and art and poetry that was blessedly less how THEY told you it was and more about the POSSIBILITIES OF IT ALL.  Beefheart's guitars & paintbrushes were singular, otherly-thinking messages, his Magic Bands and their aesthetically musical output, that ever-expanding magnum opus, TROUT MASK REPLICA: the masterpiece.  4 days ago, passed from us this lighter-than-air-but-heavier-than-thought shaman who swirled his deft Mojo Sticks in the Mojave Desert's rocket sauce and blithely re-painted a dusky musical landscape with Hobo Chang Ba, Hair Pie Bake I & II, and Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish...and that was just to start!  Captain Beefheart bent his unique sonic-vision of music upon the wills of utterly fantastic musicians who became in his sculptor's hands (perhaps unwillingly) scions of the rock-n-roll avant garde.  The dear Captain channeled from the depths of nature an impossibly ultra-human dialog and played it gloriously loud through dusty speakers to wincing listeners.  One can only imagine those live shows:  the Magic Band's twin guitars fought like light-sabres with wailing saxophones over oddly paced drums-n-bass then leavened and twisted by the grunted conjurings of a desert voodoo priest bent on painting the air with color-filled exhortations about fantastic, under-appreciated animals, quaint, ecological gardens and lot's of to-be-revered women.<br />  There is no sense in redescribing this music for you readers; others have done so admirably.  The best suggestion that can be made is that if you have hungry little earholes and are tired of what passes for new music these days:  dive right in.  It gets no more bizarre nor beautiful than Trout Mask Replica (ok, LICK MY DECALS OFF, BABY does so yet with a more rhythmic and lyrical finesse, and fewer caveman howls!).  If you can't give TMR three listens and crave three-hundred-and-thirty-three more, then MOVE ON, THERE IS NOTHING TO HEAR HERE.  But if you can patiently let this expression of pure id in, let it frighten/thrill/confuse you for all of it's 28 songs, you will have taken the sonic equivalent of a walk through a contemporary art museum, featuring a solo exhibition by the likes of Van Gogh, Picasso or Dali...AND SOMEHOW BE BETTER FOR IT.  But one needn't be an artist to appreciate this music (nor a musician, nor intellectual, nor misanthrope...tho, it may help).  Don't mistake the finely honed and muscular musicianship for addled cacophony:  wait for it.  TMR is not out of tune, merely out of time and place.  Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band have carved thoughtful, singing toy animals from joyful noise and earth just for you, little human.  So get your blues on, open up to the universe and be taken to that place of lore and artful chance that will be fondly recalled for the rest of time.ry little earholes and are tired of what passes for new music these days:  dive right in.  It gets no more bizarre nor beautiful than Trout Mask Replica (ok, LICK MY DECALS OFF, BABY does so yet with a more rhythmic and lyrical finesse, and fewer caveman howls!).  If you can't give TMR three listens and crave three-hundred-and-thirty-three more, then MOVE ON, THERE IS NOTHING TO HEAR HERE.  But if you can patiently let this expression of pure id in, let it frighten/thrill/confuse you for all of it's 28 songs, you will have taken the sonic equivalent of a walk through a contemporary art museum, featuring a solo exhibition by the likes of Van Gogh, Picasso or Dali...AND SOMEHOW BE BETTER FOR IT.  But one needn't be an artist to appreciate this music (nor a musician, nor intellectual, nor misanthrope...tho, it may help).  Don't mistake the finely honed and muscular musicianship for addled cacophony:  wait for it.  TMR is not out of tune, merely out of time and place.  Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band have carved thoughtful, singing toy animals from joyful noise and earth just for you, little human.  So get your blues on, open up to the universe and be taken to that place of lore and artful chance that will be fondly recalled for the rest of time.
030726999X|2.0|I still believe people love reading these books because the covers and titles look cool and edgy. What's between the covers? Many, many pages...many, many words...yet very little story.<br /><br />The character of Lisbeth Salander, I would say, is universally agreed to be an intriguing character for the ages, despite the consistently awkward manner in which the author wrote her (which is consistent with the way he wrote all his characters, frankly). Who she is and how she acts is compelling, foul, intriguing, and terrifying. I'd like to see a Lisbeth Salander graphic novel where she fights vampires; a Lisbeth Salander spinoff series on Showtime; hell, I'd like a sexy Lisbeth Salander action figure, complete with zombie makeup, bloody axe and laptop bag. Did I care about anybody else in this book - or the series in general? Nope, not really. Blomkvist, journalist who takes down the entire Swedish government whilst bagging hot smart woman after hot smart woman? Oy. Neidermann, the 'murderous robot from hell'? Sigh. Erika Berger, other journalist who helps take down the entire Swedish government whilst bagging hot smart man after hot smart man? Oy again. Sorry - I just can't go there.<br /><br />My real issue with this book, though, is the sheer volume of nothing that happened. For the bulk of 500 pages Salander is trapped in either a hospital room or a prison cell. All her ass-kickery boils down to a few isolated scenes where she sneaks around on the internet and a fairly ridiculous courtroom scene. Her climactic fight scene? Saw it coming a mile away. What's the point of this series if Salander's not going to run around taking everybody out at the kneecaps? The bulk of this conclusion to the trilogy was page after page of tedious description of the secret police, of Blomkvist's boring machinations and of Berger's newsroom shenanigans (which went literally nowhere in terms of the plot). Slash this weighty tome in half and take a red pen to the choppy, occasionally juvenile writing, and this might have been a fun read.nd this might have been a fun read.

1400097029|4.0|Historian of art Max Morden's wife has just died of cancer. This novel explores his grief and his efforts to find himself again. What he does is to rent a room in The Cedars, a guest room -now in decadence- where Morden and his family used to pass their vacations and where, fifty years ago, Max fell in love one summer with Chloe, the daughter of the Graces, a wealthy family also stopping there. The novel is written in the first person, and it mixes three narrative threads: the first is Max's current situation, living alone in the decayed mansion, with the proprietor, the enigmatic Mis Vavasour, and the other guest, the Colonel, a manic old man. The second is his wife's Anna's last year, as well as the history of their mariage and their daughter, Claire. And the third is the story of that wonderful and tragic summer by the sea. The ending provides two big surprises.    It is easy to empathize with Max's loss even if the reader has not experienced a similar one (and most adults have lost, if not a love partner, some other kind of loved one). Banville is very good at transmiting the feeling of destitution, mixed with the ambivalent memories of married life, and the romantic evocations of long lost summers of wonder. Perhaps what makes it even more poignant is that Max is not a great character, an outstanding person of some kind, but a retired, rather common man just like everybody else. Definitely a melancholy novel, it is very beautiful, written by a great stylist, with very good character development, skilled at conveying the perplexity, the pain, and the traps set by memory.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|The only reason I am purchasing this is because I need it to complete the series. This was the worst season and the worst way to end a good show. It's actually freakin' embarrassing. I had been a viewer of this show since it started and it's the only reason I got showtime. They could have atleast given us (the viewers) what we wanted to see, a Bette and Tina wedding. Instead, Max gets pregnant. WHAT THE!!!

Is amazing that those who Do buy the products are the one who pay the price.<br />I updated ALL firmwares and nothing... can you believe that? I mean, Why don't they advertise \\"AVATAR WON\\"T PLAY ON...\\"? And as I read around blogs over the internet, is not one player... there are a LOT of players that can't play a \\"split between DISCS\\" movie. I can also say that I have about 30 blu-ray discs and NONE of them had this problem ever. At least, if they had it, updates where painless.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Not many people will recall the book they had to read in English years past THE SCARLET LETTER. But you'll remember it (or one of the versions you watched to pass class) when watching EASY A. In part because it references it often but also because of the affectionate twist it uses here mingling the Nathaniel Hawthorne classic with a bit of John Hughes infected use of the high school arena.<br /><br />Emma Stone stars as Olive, a young girl easing her way through high school, never coming in on anyone's radar and having a relatively easy time. That all changes with the little white lie she tells her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). In an attempt to avoid spending the weekend with her new age family, Olive tells Rhia that she had a date with a college student.<br /><br />But of course Rhia twists into not just a date but an entire weekend that ends with Olive's loss of virginity to this fictional date. To make matters worse, Rhia drags this so called confession out of Olive in the girl's rest room where Holy Roller Marianne (Amanda Bynes) was using a stall. In the age of texting and cell phones, the rumor travels at light speed and soon everyone believes Olive is the tramp of all tramps.<br /><br />Things get even more complicated after Olive goes off on Marianne's friend and ends up in detention. Fellow detentionee Brandon is constantly picked on because the school thinks he's gay, which he is. He just would rather not deal with the bullying. Olive lets Brandon know how the rumor started without any factual basis and suggest he do the same, telling people he scored with some female student. Of course he convinces the good hearted Olive into pretending she was his conquest. A fake liaison behind closed doors at a party and the word spreads once more.<br /><br />But this leads to more problems as Brandon tells various friends about the arrangement he had with Olive. Now more misfits come to her asking for the same favor paying with gift cards from various stores. The deeper Olive gets into the lie, the more Marianne seeks to remove her and her rumor inspired activities from the school. Not only that, Rhia turns her back on her friend when she takes center stage instead of her.<br /><br />All of this escalates to a point where the notoriety soon becomes more than Olive can handle. Toss in the lies affecting her favorite teacher and the dream of one day becoming involved with the boy she's had a crush on for years and you can see where this is going.<br /><br />The solution Olive comes up with is original and inspired (as I said) by the many movies John Hughes made involving teens in trouble like SIXTEEN CANDLES and PRETTY IN PINK with a nice play on the film SAY ANYTHING. These movies all presented us with a world where every teen character had a problem that was solved by the end of the film. The same happens here. It's the journey that makes it worth watching.<br /><br />The movie is funny, touching and a nice look at the world of teen rumors, gossiping and hurtful ways. With any luck, teens watching the film will come away thinking twice about the things they say and text.<br /><br />Emma Stone is marvelous here, offering that young girl quality so necessary to the character as well as the innocence of the things she sets in motion. Her smile lights up the screen when she has those moments where she gets to show the real character of Olive rather than the fake one she offers the students.<br /><br />The movie offers plenty of laughs and some tender moments as well while taking swipes at those who would consider themselves above the rest and morally superior to everyone around them. In truth, everyone has a side they'd rather not let the rest of the world see. In the character of Olive, we get a glimpse of what could happen if you created a side that didn't exist but others believed.<br /><br />For me the true test of a movie is whether or not I think I'd watch it again. This movie may not be Oscar material but it will remain on my shelf. It was fun. It made me smile. And you'll definitely have a good time watching it keeping in mind that it's not Shakespeare but just a movie and a good one at that.good time watching it keeping in mind that it's not Shakespeare but just a movie and a good one at that.

0439023513|5.0|Heartbreaking...    Haunting...Chilling...    Intense...    Brutal...Dark...    Painful...    Superbly written.     Unpredicatable.      Moments of greatness...    A YA book about so much more than teenage angst or romantic love.    What must a society be willing to lose to defeat evil?    A complex, heartwrenching, story with a cast of well defined characters and a suspenseful storyline.    A war story full of sacrifice and impossible choices.    A brave, strong, heroine (so rare in a YA book).    Buttercup (I cried)...    A fitting ending to an utterly amazing story.    Not what I expected...better!    I devoured this book.    By the way, I now dislike roses.  You too?
B0015DROBO|3.0|I tried to match my reading enthusiasm with the excitement that i had about picking up this book...I read quite a bit, and a broad variety of material, and I assumed that such a well reviewed book would floor me.  It was just so-so.  Danielle Steele is a bestseller too I guess, and I don't read her books.<br />  The meat of the review:  It was a crime novel with some plot twists.  There were a few key characters with some personality quirks, but none of the characters were deeply enough developed to make me keep caring about them after I put the book down.  The characters didn't excite me, and this is an incredibly long read.  I want to read the sequel, simply because I want to see if it gets captivating at some point; I fear that it will not.

Throw in a collapsed bridge, murders and murderous plots, a one-armed monk with a secret past, a buried letter, accusals of witchcraft, the plague, and forbidden loves and Follett has written another fascinating story set in 1300 England.    Not for the faint hearted:  barbaric and graphic throughout.  Follett likes to shock and even offend.  But the story always shines through with strong characters, plot twists and turns, and strong historical accuracy.    Not as good as Pillars, but hard to put down.

B0044E9LW6|5.0|Of all the various Dio live releases I believe this one captures the \\"in concert\\" feel the best. It features a band that was the best of both worlds, having the experienced Ronnie Dio, Jimmy Bain and Vinnie Appice who were rock veterans even in '83 joined by the then young and hungry Vivian Campbell ('83) and Craig Goldy ('87). The setlist is just fantastic on both the '83 and '87 shows. Classic tracks from the Sabbath and Rainbow days are included along with Dio's own incredible catalog up to the excellent Dream Evil. Dio's voice is in top form, clear and powerful and without some of the harder edged tone that came in later years. Great sound, great setlist, and above all, its Dio. What more can a metal fan ask for? I for one am grateful that these shows were released and not left to gather dust on some shelf. Long live Rock and Roll and Ronnie James Dio.

B001TODCII|5.0|I've looked over a few of the reviews of this movie on this site, and was appalled<br />at the misinformation given by some of these reviewers. I just watched this movie<br />yesterday, and I have to say that this movie was excellent. The poor reviews I<br />saw on this site is what compelled me to write this review, as it appaears that<br />these folks didn't even watch the show. Unlike most action type movies of today;<br />which have very little credible story line, at times poor acting, and usually<br />what story line it has wriiten around senseless violence with very little purpose<br />except to get you to fork over your money for a useless unentertaining feature;<br />this movie has a good story line, a good cast, violence where needed for story<br />line but not over done, and it moves along quickly, not boring the viewer waiting<br />for the action and/or story line to move on. The only real thing I can imagine<br />that other reviewers may not like with this movie, is the lack of gore, which<br />is another thing that makes this movie so good. It's well worth the aasking price<br />for the DVD, and I'm buying one right away. Liam Neeson did not disappoint. I've<br />seen him in good movies, and bad ones. This was most definitely a good one. I<br />highly reccommend this DVD.

0307595579|5.0|Sets like this have several purposes. One is simply putting a set of related works together, for people who want to acquire all parts, for instance, of a set of books. Another is \\"value added\\" by putting together a set.<br /><br />For those who have not read the Millennium trilogy, this is a nice way of \\"one stop shopping.\\" Begin with a \\"murder mystery,\\" \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Here, we begin with journalist Mikael Blomkvist losing credibility and being humiliated for lack of journalistic integrity, all because of a set up concocted by someone whom he was investigating. We get introduced to Lisbeth Salander, a victim of many kinds of abuse, but independent, extraordinarily talented, and a keen researcher. She partners with Blomkvist to solve a series of murders.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" follows. Salander has separated herself from Blomkvist and others. She ends up, in essence, being framed for three murders (although by accident). Blomkvist tries to solve the question as to what happened; Salander does her own research to find out what actually happened. We see the dynamic story that results from her relationship to her father, a vicious Soviet defector, Zalachenko. At the end of the novel, in trying to get her revenge against her father, she is grievously wounded.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" follows up where the previous novel ends. Salander has surgery for her multiple wounds, rehabilitates, and is subject to a government effort to put her back in a mental institution--to protect a rogue element within the Swedish security establishment. The book, which is drearily slow and detailed in the middle, ends with a dramatic (albeit not totally believable) courtroom scene, a confrontation between Salander and her murderous half-brother, and a quiet reconciliation (perhaps) with Blomkvist.<br /><br />The other aspect of a set like this is \\"value added.\\" There is an extra element here--a piece focusing on Stieg Larsson himself. Many will know that Larsson died of a heart attack before the trilogy was published, thus never experiencing the success of his creation.<br /><br />So, this set works pretty well on two separate levels.on died of a heart attack before the trilogy was published, thus never experiencing the success of his creation.

B0000E1WKE|4.0|First thing I would like to say is this was release in 2003,it is now 2010 I just got the cd even though I am a huge Whitney Houston fan. The reason why I didn't buy it back in 2003 was I was disappointed with Just Whitney released in 2002. After I Look To You comeback of 2009 and reading reviews I decided to buy it. My review of this is it is pretty damn good(my title)but not perfect(but what is?). Obviously from her personal habits(drugs,smoking,heaving touring and vocal nodules) they have taken a toll on her vocal chords but lets be real this woman can still saaaaaaaannnng and with the best of them. At this time when this cd was done her vocals were really bad a good example was Divas Live 2003 the performance with Bobby Brown was especially horrible. On this cd her vocals were awesome there is a little bit of oversinging as mention by another reviewer I think they may have been(just my personal opinion)due to the fact that vocally she can't do some of the higher octave notes that were heard in her prime 80s and 90s so to make up for them she added a few more runs, with said she still is a GREAT SINGER(not just good). Gems on this are O Holy Night, Who Would Imagine A King, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and The First Noel. She really did a great job on these classic to some up my review a CLASSIC CD FROM A CLASSIC GREAT SANNGING WOMAN WHO I HAVE LOVED SINCE 1985. Keep putting it out there Whitney trust me God has blessed you and there are millions who are ready to buy and listen!!!!!!

I really like the liner notes and LOOOVE Michael's hand written moments of inspiration.   It's priceless to me and worth the buy alone.     Those of you who understand the creative process surely will appreciate this. It's when someone get struck by something from above, usually in the middle of the night. You feel the urge to write it down. Whatever it is.   When I get this, I don't even turn the lights on. I just get a piece of paper and write in the dark. Whatever comes into my mind. And many times when morning comes and I look at my notes,  it looks like \\"chicken monkey\\" :-))  (term for unreadable/uncomprehensible writtings or ideas).    It's what those precious Michael notes remind me of and why this album is important.    Personnally, I've chosen to boycott Sony a long time ago, but with all their electronics, but a CD? C'mon man.

B000UZNSWM|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - very well-written and educational, an excellent primer to the conflict on the Korean peninsula.  However, the Kindle version of this book has extremely poor graphics, mainly the maps, which are very fuzzy and legends impossible to read (I'm using a DX). This was very frustrating - maps are often essential to a description of a military engagement.     It would be great if the publisher could fix this problem.
0060989157|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was very interesting and I was completely drawn in from beginning to end. I am a pretty recent Motley Crue fan and only have their SOLA album but for me it's not about being a die hard Motley fan. I began to show interest in Nikki Sixx when his band, Sixx AM had their hit Life is Beautiful and I bought that album. After reading the Heroin Diaries and deciding to give Motely Crue's music a try I wanted to learn a little more about this talented group of guys. That is where this book comes in.<br /><br />I learned so much about the band members from this book, but again this is coming from someone who knew nothing about them (except Nikki) before reading it. I never knew about Vince's struggle with his daughter's cancer. I don't follow the tabloids or celebrity gossip, so the story of Tommy and Pamela was almost completely new to me, and it was heartbreaking. I discovered that I have a lot in common with Mick Mars, if only because he doesn't have a lot to say, and is pretty absent from the majority of the book. I think I will be reading this book multiple times throughout my life because it is something you want to read over and over. I highly recommend this book. I know my review didn't give a lot of details about what exactly this book is or what to expect but I can tell you that if you are a fan of Motley Crue or a fan of autobiographical rock novels such as the Heroin Diaries, then you will love this book.
B0031RS44S|1.0|I listened to this book on CD from the library, thankfully, read by Dick Hill. Dick Hill is somewhere between an o.k. reader and very annoying with his overly dramatic pronunciation of words. I listened to half of it and lost interest. The characters are not interesting or ones that I found any reason to care about. They have found two prior associates have been brutally murdered leading them to assume that they too are on the hit list, yet they keep taking long walks on the street. Huh? How stupid is that? Until at one point a shooter takes the opportunity to shoot at four of them at once. Reacher, the main character hears the cylinder slide in the gun from 100 yards away and reacts with lightning speed, saving the day. Ridiculous. I lost interest shortly after that.

It is difficult to change the AAA batteries -- the little screw is located in the smokestack.  Forward and reverse directions.<br /><br />Back when we got this, they ran about $40 -- that seems about right for all the fun we have with it.

Disney took the story of the prince who has been turned into a frog and can only be saved by a kiss, and launched a story all its own.  The story itself is pleasant enough, but frankly, it is nothing special.  What IS special about this film is Disney's return to a 2D, hand drawn animation style and the wonderful idea to set this film in bayou country in Louisiana.      First, the story.  In this film, a plucky but poor young lady named Tiana desires nothing more than to open a restaurant and prepare the food she and her dear departed father used to enjoy making for their friends and neighbors.  She has remained friends with spoiled but kind-hearted rich girl...and this puts her into contact with Prince Naveen, who is visiting New Orleans in search of a rich girl to marry (because his parents have cut him off from their money).  Unfortunately, by the time Tiana meets him, he's already been turned into a frog by the local voodoo specialist, Dr. Facilier.  He convinces Tiana to kiss him...but rather than break the spell, Tiana is ALSO turned into a frog.  This launches the two into an unlikely but fun adventure in the swamps, where they meet a friendly gator and a very amusing (and very Cajun) firefly.  Leave it to Disney to come up with great sidekicks.  And the idea of the fireflies is not only creative, but leads to some absolutely gorgeous scenes.    And those gorgeous scenes are rendered \\"old school\\".  I'm sure some of this was aided by computer...but the look is hand-drawn, just like the days of SNOW WHITE or SLEEPING BEAUTY.  While I heartily enjoy the Pixar films and many other 3D-esque animated features...PRINCESS AND THE FROG reminded me that these 2D images can feel like masterpieces of art come to life.  The lush and colorful backgrounds somehow feel more \\"real\\" than the sometimes photorealistic backgrounds of a film like TOY STORY.  I frequently found myselfsimply marveling at the gorgeous, watercolor backgrounds or the sumptuous, evocative color choices.  The whole film feels like a Mardi Gras.    The story certainly could have been told in other settings...but putting it in New Orleans at what feels like the time between the two World Wars was genius.  We see the stark contrasts between rich and poor.  Between black & white.  Yet New Orleans has a sparkle and energy that is unique...and that comes to vivid life too.  It's a melting pot like no other...and the film captures that mood and ambiance.  And this setting inspired Randy Newman to write some of his most un-Randy Newman-like music...and it works great.  I FREQUENTLY found myself tapping my toes to the beat.  The songs are simply terrific.  None really became breakout hits...but they all wonderfully accent the film.    The voice work is generally top notch.  A few famous folks drop by, such as Oprah Winfrey and the unmistakable John Goodman (both in small roles).  But led by relative unknown Anika Noni Rose as Tiana...we spend very little time \\"recognizing\\" famous voices, and most of the time appreciating the uniformly excellent acting and singing.      The film was a modest hit in theaters.  It just didn't generate huge excitement.  Heck, it took me over a year to see it.  But truly it is a throwback to Disney's glory days, and while it doesn't quite achieve the heights of PINOCCHIO or CINDERELLA...it is a very, very worthy entry into that pantheon.  While it's great for adults, please try to see it with a child.  They'll thank you.
B001W63DXC|5.0|This is a great live album by a really great live band there are a few numbers where it seems they push the tempos alittle but other than that there isn't much variation in the live sound. They do seem more energetic on this live album than they have in the past. the sound quality is good and songs KICK ASS!
B002BAWIWU|1.0|Can someone PLEASE tell me if this CD (George Harrison Let It Roll), is available in a JEWEL CASE????.  I refuse to buy a Digi-pak CD, but desperately want this CD!. Please Help.....and you record companies are  complete idiots for making a digi-pak CD....they (Digi-paks) never last....but if it was in a jewel case, they last as they are PROTECTED (the artwork)!!!!.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Percy Jackson The Battle of the Labyrinth is probaly the best book ever in the series. All I have got to say is that this book is a must have.
B002ZG980U|1.0|I like Nolan okay. I watch Memento fairly often and I enjoy it. I also like most of the cast of Inception. DiCaprio keeps turning out good performances even with weak material. But most of all, I like the epistemological/ontological subject matter of the film - The Cartesian Dream Problem, Plato's Allegory of the Cave, etc. It is a rich and worthwhile topic of discussion, and if done correctly it can make for an excellent film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Inception didn't live up to its potential. It was over-weighted by special effects and forced drama, and far too light on actual substance or insight. And believe me, it's not that it went over my head. It went under my head. Maybe it received so many rave reviews because the number of morons who are impressed by zero-gravity fight scenes and collapsing cities is growing by the minute. Recommendation: only see Inception if you get free tickets and have an evening to kill. Better yet, just read Descartes' First Meditation and then watch Brazil (1985).
142311339X|5.0|Okay, i don't have alot of time to write this, but this book is amazing !  one of the best books i've ever read!! if you liked Percy Jackson, you'll adore  these ! i can't wait for the 2nd one !!!!!!!!! (:
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific miniseries may not be as easy and as nice to watch as BoB. But after seeing The Pacific, you may know that many other units (other than Easy Company - BoB) may be facing much tougher situation than Easy Company during WW2. I am glad that the Pacific includes the stories of at least 1 Medal of Honor recipient in the movie. I wish Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks included more stories of individuals that receive Medal of Honor during WW2.    The stories in the Pacific miniseries are much more accurate, and do not contain as much exaggeration and deviation from the true story as BoB.     It may help make your watching the Pacific easier if you first watch the documentary, then the profiles of the main characters in the features (last DVD of the miniseries). It will help also if you do some light readings first regarding the main characters and the Pacific war. You can find these light readings easily on the internet.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|This camera was advertised as being able to store 80 images on the internal memory.  According to the manufacturer's website the memory was 128MB.  And reviewers here have said the camera can store 150-200 images.  So imagine my surprise when I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and it would only store 40-50 images before the internal memory was full. So I hooked it up to the computer and found that it had only 28MB.  I contacted the maker (Digital Blue) and was told that it now ships with only 28MB and that they would update the website--which they have now done.  The Amazon description still says \\"up to 80 photos.\\"    It is really a pretty good camera for a little kid. Simple to use and while the images aren't great, they are ok.  The child needs to learn to hold still when taking the photo, and to pay attention to the lighting.  And as others say, beware the super flash.  What is really great is that it charges from a USB cable rather than using batteries.      I got a small amount back from Amazon for the misleading description and decided to keep it.  I'll update my review after my grandson has a go with it.
0740748475|5.0|There are few things I remember from my childhood that were both as cerebral and funny as Calvin and Hobbes.  There is probably an appropriate strip for about every other moment, and really, no other strip has come as close in terms of caliber of writing.  Watterson's stylish, visceral panels carried a lot of humor, a lot more feeling, and Hawkeye Pierce level of the sardonic.  Regardless of what I think of this strip, however, the books themselves are bound heavily and handsomely, and the 23 pound set is printed on heavy art paper; it is apparent that the same amount of love and care that went into the drawing and writing went into Watterson's considerations for putting together this set.  It is well-known that the only merchandise he has ever authorized has been the collections books, and so it is fitting that the entirety of the series should be conveyed in something with a little more physical weight than your average coffee table book.    Aside from the fact that this set is a book-end until itself (and there is a lot to be said for being able to put this on one end of a shelf and not have to worry about the other books falling over because what in the world but a second set of this type leaning could ever knock it over?), the warm ruddy brown exterior looks beautiful on a bookshelf and is eye-catching.    This is the kind of gift one gives a serious fan; everyone has met the kind of person who loves this comic strip, and it is we (those people) that appreciate this sort of thing best as we still have an appreciation for Calvin's world and Hobbes' one liners.  You certainly could spend the same money as this set costs on video games and the like, but I am quite certain that I have gotten more enjoyment out of these books than I ever would have out of some surely-frustrating game for a scant ten or 15 hours of gameplay.  In getting this set for younger readers, we might hope it imparts in them a desire for the lost activity of playing outside, which today seemsa wholly foreign concept; snowmen eating snowcones made from other snowmen do not build themselves.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Fans of the Camel Club series will not be disappointed.  Baldacci's imagination provides another intriguing read that I'm sure many in DHS and the IC will use for scenario planning.  I'm sure many worry he's too creative.  Oliver Stone is once again the hero with the rest of the Camel Club is lesser supporting roles.  There are plenty of new characters that I'm sure will be woven into future novels.  If you haven't read the other Camel Club books, start with them first, but if you've read the others, order Hell's Corner now for some great winter reading.
B000NVAK0G|2.0|This was a good book for making a person appreciate his/her life and to get an interesting perspective into Ireland's past.  The author has a candid, amusing at times storytelling style.  However, if you like books with a plot and story line that moves, this isn't for you.  It's so depressing too, but things get better at the end.
030746363X|5.0|Finally a concise, easy to read book that looks at things a critical eye instead of marketing hype.  A must for anyone interested in their personal well being and willing to WORK to make those things attainable.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This new show is hysterical. It really lifts my spirits when I watch it. Ed O'Neill is in his element. They really found the right mix of characters and actors to make the chemistry work![[ASIN:B002JVWQSW Modern Family: The Complete First Season]]
B0049YU4HC|5.0|I was able to pick out this watch for myself as a Christmas gift. The price paid was just at the $300 mark, which for this watch is a steal. The face is very sharp looking and the yellow second hand on the contrast of the black face really sticks out. I know there is a blue-faced version available and I saw them both in person before I ordered this. The black just looks better. As already pointed out the band is thin in diameter compared to the face but it works for the design of the watch. The band itself is very stylish and has a great shine to it. Point being that together is makes for a very sharp presentation. The watch just looks really nice and you'll get a lot of complements. As far as the functionality I've put it through it's paces and it works just great. There has been no loss of time. Overall I think for the price you can't got wrong and it's well worth picking one up.
0316548189|4.0|As an American Teenager, I remembered hearing about Mr. Mandela being relased from prison.  I remember thinking, \\"wow, he was in jail a long time\\" and that was about it.  Many years had passed and I watched the movie, \\"Invictus\\".  It was from this movie that a real fascination for Mr. Mandela had developed. So as I often do I looked to see if he had an autobiography and found this book.      My first thought when I started this book is that I am going to get lost in the geographical aspects, tribal names, and the many associates of Mr. Mandela but I powered through.  I am so glad I did.  Not only is the book a good history book on the struggle of an opressed people but an entertaining story as well.      I found myself taking notes on things he said that make great quotes for everyday life. That's what type of book this is.  A book that you want to remember because you can use his wisdom in your life.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|It's been 20 years since a stand-alone predator movie has been made (besides the alien vs predator movies).  I like how it expands on the Predator franchise by showing different worlds besides being set on Earth, although the alien jungle looks a lot like South America.  The characters were great, the different kind of predators are awesome, it is overall a worthy entry in the predator franchise. Also if you get Predators blu-ray at Wal-Mart, it comes with a dvd, blu-ray, and digital copy three disc, and that's great.
B000000W5B|4.0|First of all be careful which edition you get, the newer remaster really is as bad as the reviewers say. It sounds wrong. The 'old' one is still nice, maybe not the best Stones album ever but any album that has Angie on it deserves at least 4 stars.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|By far THE best album release this year. Kanye West's artistic nature shines through the various sounds he portrays his newest album \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" and even goes as far as creating a 35 minute visual fantasy accompanied by songs from his album. Most definitely worth the money spent.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|Works great, allowing you to hook your iphone4 up to a docking type item....i.e., clock radio. With this little item you do not need to remove the iphone from the Otter Box to dock with different devices......!!<br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I think the price is to much. But, without competition, it was the only one I could find........, they can charge what they like!!... I just love the free market system!!!
B003UESJHO|5.0|I recently saw this movie and came away incredibly impressed on a number of levels. Mark Wahlberg was apparently in training to do this movie for more than 4 years and it really showed as he was incredibly good when it came to the boxing technique that he showed. It felt as if you were watching a real boxer and nothing felt fake about it.  Another part of the movie that was quite authentic was the depiction of Lowell, MA as a city. Coming from the Boston area, I can say that it was quite good. The 7 sisters who were shown were totally hilarious---a real good look at what it is like for a family that has no options and has to stay home, essentially hang around, and depend on one person to be the primary earner.  Another great part of the movie was the underlying theme of crack addiction and what it can do not just to a person but to a family.  Overall a very solid movie and very worthwhile to see.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Nina has to be perfect, not good or great or excellent or top notch, she has to be 100%. Nina Sayers is chosen to star in her New York ballet company's production of Swan Lake, but she having a little trouble getting into the roll. Nina is able to throw herself into the role of the White Swan with no problem. The White Swan is pure and unvarnished, just like Nina. The Black Swan is not. She's soiled and tarnished a flowing succubus. Nina is not. Nina is timid, Nina is frigid, Nina is so high strung her feet are just barely touching the atmosphere<br /><br />Nina Sayer is devoted to ballet in the truest sense of the word; Nina doesn't go out, doesn't have any friends, and doesn't have a personal life. Her world is dancing and nothing but dancing. And it's starting to break her. She develops a nervous scratching habit that tears up her skin, and she starts seeing things, and hearing things.<br /><br />A new addition to the company Lily, is the opposite from Nina, Lily is from San Francisco and goes with the flow, she smokes, wolfs down hamburgers and drops ecstasy(or acid). A first threaten by Lily, Nina develops a strained friendship that jumps back and forth between lustful when Lily shows Nina how to let loose to murderous when Lily because Nina's backup. It is only when Nina becomes murderous that the Black Swan comes out with vengeance, enabling Nina to dance at the premier of the play with such ease and relaxation that between sets Nina has a post-orgasmic glow on her pale face.<br /><br />The old ballerina came out in both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, both had done ballet as young girls but Darren Aronofsky had them train a year in advance of filming, both women lost 20 pounds, Portman who is about hundred pounds wet, is almost a stick figure, her feet became so tone that she could bend railroad spikes with her toes. One of them actually had a toe nail ripped out and Portman apparently dislocated one rib and got a concussion.
193413712X|5.0|Great book, unfortunately short. The author has the talent to put you inside the mind of the protagonist. You could feel and touch all the memories of a man dying (created from his testimony, from his imagination or from his ghostly knowledge, it doesn't metter) and, like him, becoming something like a soul being freed from its body.
B00064VRHU|5.0|I truly love this movie.  Patrick Swayze is one of the most sexy men ever.  Great girl movie!  Super dancing - great moral to the story.  Just a beautiful movie from beginning to end.
0743298039|5.0|Some books have good stories but are painfully written.  Other books are well written but don't have much substance.  This book is a lovely blend of both.

B002VECM6S|1.0|I thought I had gotten a deal when I got this movie for 3.99 - but when I opened the package for my kids to watch it the week before Christmas - it was scratched horribly.  Needless to say, they were extremely disappointed - and I had been ripped off.

B0043GAZYS|4.0|I would give it 1000 stars if only... Universal would give a better customer service. Or a decent one, at least.  I bought this really amazing movie, and when I tried to download my digital copy, iTunes didn´t let me, adressing some kind of unexplained error.  So I wrote Universal Digital Copy Support, and a week later they replied saying it was Apple´s fault, as I didn´t live in USA or Canada, and that would prevent me from downloading content from the iTunes Store. Several hours later, when I stopped laughing at such ridiculous statement (I keep buying things at the iTunes store -and downloading them, of course-) I wrote back telling this to them -and considering it was clear it was all Universal´s fault- and asked for solution. But they never ever replied to me again.  I keep writing to them as I want to have what I paid for. Maybe for Scott Pilgrim III...
B002JWD6AS|5.0|i was very amazed by this book. it was better than i thought . it had amazing details to make u feel like ure in the book. i would this again and again!
B003XIO7ZK|3.0|I've always like this band, they've always had a unique vibe about them. This latest Digger release carry's on with the Scottish vs English theme that has been a big part of Grave Diggers history. These Germans just love that stuff! Anyway, as always the songs are very well thought out structure wise and the lyrical content is very well done. I do like this release overall, it has that familiar Digger sound which is a good thing. However I also feel it's lacking somewhat in the catchy riffage area. Their are some good riffs to be found here, theirs no doubting that, but for me personally, I wish their were more of them. It's still a good cd don't get me wrong, but it could have been better.<br /><br />I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5.
0810971089|5.0|My son is now twelve, and developing a healthy taste for voracious reading (thankfully, the only thing he takes after me in!)... I really couldn't tell you about the book, 'cause i haven't read it- but i read the first three books in the Wimpy Kid series, and I totally endorse Jeff Kinney. No zombies, cursing or sex (unless you count being trapped in the Girls' bathroom at school), but still  aggravating, uneven and funny... much like (as my son tells me) actual life as an average kid. I would recommend this book- and the others by Jeff Kinney, especially the Do-It-Yourself book, for any parent of any young person caught in the school-age area between superstars and bullies, big brothers and well-meaning but often clueless parents and teachers...
B00447G2T8|4.0|Theirs just something about Euro metal that is far superior to anything here in North America. This latest Helloween release is proof positive that that trend does indeed continue here. The songs rock and the overall production is open sounding and not overly compressed like so many other cd's today.<br /><br />This band has gone through many changes over the years both personel and direction wise. However despite all that turnover, they've always managed to put out some top quality stuff. This latest release is one of their better efforts to date. The songs are less over the top and more straight ahead sounding than in years past and it totally works here. The musicianship is awesome and the tunage is well put together. Melody, speed, texture, intensity, it's all here and it's good. Did I hear a flute solo in there somewhere, what the hell? Seriously, this band is smokin' on this release and this new direction is very fresh sounding. I like the fact it was recorded without a click track as it give the listener more of a live sounding feel and less of that robotic crap that kills so much energy in songs as far as I'm concerned. It also says something about what these guys can do musicianship wise. Very impressive indeed!<br /><br />Easily a 4.5 out of 5 stars, Check it out!

0375842381|5.0|My 10-yr-old daughter borrowed the first book of this trilogy from the library and we read it together in the evenings before she went to bed. We both enjoyed it so much that I bought her this set and I am very pleased. The books are beautifully boxed and not too heavy for young hands to hold up. They are a great value.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|I bought this for the 3D and I was pleasently surprised! I have the \\"other\\" animated 3D movies and they utterly pale in comparison to the 3D here. I only watched the 2nd chapter and that was more than enough for me to get an idea of what I could expect.<br /><br />As far as 3D animated movies go, there is nothing better. At least not now! Well done Disney. Well done!...
1416550550|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book, the blurb made is sound interesting, it should have been interesting. I've had the book for about 5 weeks now, I normally can complete a book in a day, after 5 weeks, I am only on page 95. The book is so darn confusing bouncing back and forth it's hard to keep up or even keep interested. It was very disappointing that what could have been a good story was a pile of statements thrown into a mixer and put out as a book.
B0008ISM40|4.0|Je connaissais déjà bien cet album. J'ai donc découvert la version remixée en multicanal. Cela donne de l'ampleur au mix, et rend intelligible beaucoup d'éléments dans les morceaux, auxquels nous ne faisons pas attention dans la version stéréo. Par contre le dual disc ne permet pas une protection optimale du disque (deux faces). Mais si vous possédez comme moi la version CD cela n'est pas un soucis !
0767817478|1.0|Just goes to show, americans just don't 'get' giant monsters, and this movie is proof. 1st off, it doesn't even LOOK like Godzilla. Just a giant T Rex on steroids. The plot was...UGH. Godzilla is a hermaphrodite? REALLY? Now let me see if I can understand this- Godzilla is suppossed to be this unstoppable force, yet in the movie, he gets hung up on a bridge. REALLY??? And he/it can't catch a few people driving away in a cab. Uh huh, ok. Nothing about this movie feels, or even looks like a Godzilla movie. Any true Godzilla movie fan knows, Godzilla is about insane plots, bad special effects, and pure campiness. THIS movie was just bad all the way around. Little known fact, (or maybe not, if you're a true fan) Toho brought Godzilla out of retirement and made Godzilla 2000 to make up for the pure junk, mess, and insert expletive of this movie. A scene from Godzilla Final Wars has the TRUE Godzilla fighting the American version. Guess who wins? Not even close. The special effects were good, that's the only good point of the movie. After watching this, I wanted my 2 hours back I had just wasted. Here's hoping no 1 in America decides to redo Gamera. He'll probably be a giant salamander who gets killed by being tripped and falling on a lamppost coated in rocksalt because it's the only thing that that will stop his blood from coagualating. Sound silly? So was this movie, flush it like the turd it is. FYI, Gamera is giant flying, fire breathing turtle, who was created by a rival Japanese movie studio to capitalize on the success of the Godzilla brand.
031237593X|4.0|I first read and loved this book many years ago and became a fervent believer in the \\"White Legend\\". Penman draws her characters well and the sheer emotion of the story carries you along.    Nevertheless, I always had a nagging doubt in my mind about her hypothesis and after reading Desmond Seward's \\"Richard III-The Black Legend\\" I was finally and irrevocably convinced of the guilt of Richard III. But let it be said in the course of history, his crime of infanticide has been too readily eclipsed. And from a real politik viewpoint, one must come to the conclusion that Richard III had little choice; either fight to win, or flee the country and abandon his wealth and property to the Woodville faction, which controlled the young sons of Edward IV.    And another more fascinating fact has come to light recently: Edward the IV was illegitimate! So in Richard's mind, he was claiming what was rightfully his; George, Duke of Clarence, having been executed.........and so in his dynastic viewpoint, in eliminating the Princes he was restoring the rightful branch of the House of York to the throne.    He just shouldn't of made that suicidal charge against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field..........it was tactical idiocy, but then the Plantagenets were reknowned for their recklessness!    Read this fine novel, but take it with a pinch of salt.
0307346617|5.0|I didn't think it was possible to come out of the shadow of a legendary genius like Mel Brooks, but Max Brooks has done it. This novel explores new depths of human emotion as zombies take over the earth.<br /><br />This is not a sloppy \\"AND THEN THE GUTS CAME OUT!\\" kind of horror novel. It's much more subtle and classier than that. While there are great action scenes of people fighting and attempting to outwit zombies, it is not the core of the book. It's fascinating to read about how some of the countries handle the outbreak, and how the average person does as well.<br /><br />This is a quick read, but you will want to savor it. You'll undoubtely come back to it again and again for pleasure reading, or when you just need to spook yourself a bit.
0425221806|5.0|[[ASIN:0425221806 Watchers]]    This is a great piece of reading material.  The book was one to pull you in and then hold you in.    The condition of this item was just as stated.  Very happy with this item.

B0010358CG|2.0|To me, story is important. Appleseed was much more better than EX Machina. Also, this movie didn't seem to be as dark and had more of a generic Hollywood feel to it. To be honest, Appleseed was so good I didn't expect this to be good as Appleseed. However, I didn't expect it to be this bad. The graphics are better on EX Machina, but who cares if the movie isn't fulfilling.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The ending really suprised me. The cinematography could have been better, though.

B000KFB4PK|4.0|I like this watch. My son is learning to tell time so it is perfect and fun. Kids do not learn to tell time on digital watches. The face is smaller so it fits on his wrist well. Parts stay together.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I won't waste time repeating plot synopses or anything like that.  I'm just going to put in our four cents (my middle-aged two cents, and those of my teenage daughter) and say that the two of us actually laughed more together at this movie than at any other Hollywood product, ever.  I don't understand the people my age saying that they're too old to understand this film.  We watched it, and, not wanting it to be over, we watched it, again, over the next couple of days with each of the commentaries.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|This collection is a professional recording; everything is great.Buying this collection (5 disc) is cheaper price than buying individually. Thanks.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I did not like this item.  Somehow I thought it would depict all the U.S. service in the pacific, not just the marines and some navy. Also, I expected historical footage, not a hollywood movie.  Was disappointed.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|The video arrived on time and was well packed for shipping  by Amazon.com.  The story is not the best one by Jane Austen but it is  very well done and delightful to watch. I think any grown   up would enjoy this movie.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|Anyone get this movie that saw it in the theater? Well I did, and am I PIS**D OFF! Not only did they not include subtitles for the minions during the credits, but they are still discriminating against people that do not have smart-phones. I have now paid over $50 and still have no idea what they are saying!!!    I will no longer be purchasing any movies from this production company or even go to see them at the theater. This action on the part of the studio becomes an advocate of illegal downloading. I myself will not resort to illegal activity, but many have stated that they will rather than give this company any money for discriminating against them.
B000RC129Y|4.0|Is this a lesson in the craft of writing? Yes. In the same way you expect the unexpected from any of Stephen King's books, the answer is yes.      To begin, with Mr. King reveals his own personal story in a quick, frank, entertaining way. As I see it, the moral of the story is: Experience an inordinate, sometimes painful childhood and early adulthood, populated by colorfully quirky characters while possessing the artistic fortitude (drugs and alcohol not withstanding) to recognize the richness of these circumstances, coupled by the courage to follow your own radar, and you too can become a captivating writer. Oh, and get a good education along the way.      The semi-technical lessons on writing following his brief recollections, place him directly across the table from the reader. Casual, realistic conversational instruction. These are useful, easy to understand tools and opinions. No matter how helpful they may be, compared to the primary focus of his memoirs, they generally seem to be less significant afterthoughts. And, hey, that's okay too.     I am in no way disappointed in this great little book.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I recommend this to anyone. Even if you have not cared for his music before, you will be surprised with this CD. He sounds great and has returned to his kind of blue grass southern sound which he does so well. I love the whole CD and everyone that I have shared it with says it is his best.
B0012OVFHK|5.0|And what stunningly beautiful interpretations these two versions turned out to be.<br /><br />Certainly, much of the grittiness of the original work is lost to orchestrations which utilize pianos alone or pianos with subtle synth parts.<br /><br />Frankly, I think that's beside the point.<br /><br />Questions I always have: Does this new work give me fresh insights into the old? Does this new recording bear repeated listening and does it entertain me in a way similar to the original work? In a 'nostalgic' work such as this, does it take me back to a time and place like the original does?<br /><br />All I can say is yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />The pianists are technically brilliant. The sound is superb. And the shimmering flow of this unique set of orchestrations is inspiring.<br /><br />I am usually the first to dismiss some lame new reinterpretation of a brilliant work that should probably be left untouched.<br /><br />But this CD won me over big time.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|What can I tell about Vedder´s music, it´s \\"simply\\" music. And if you saw de film, then you´ll appreciate it more.  Totally recommended
0007105045|5.0|Tree and Leaf brings together a few shorter works that help illuminate Tolkien's thoughts on the uses and purposes of myth and story. The essay \\"On Fairy-stories\\" outlines Tolkien's thoughts on what exactly makes up a fairy-story, as opposed to a fairy-tale, etc, and how story does not tell a beautiful lie, but a better truth that speaks to who we are. Mythopoeia, a poem in response to detractors, is in many ways the same thoughts from Tolkien's essay but in poetic form. \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" draws out the tensions of calling, responsibility and the \\"sub-creative\\" powers which we are endowed with as the imago dei. The one oddity, though by no means detracting from the book, is the translation of \\"The Homecoming of Beorthnoth.\\" It is an inspiring and intriguing story, but does not completely fit with the ideas of creation and story.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|For a movie that is packed with some of the biggest names in action, as well as some fairly decent stars in general, this movie does not disappoint. Great action sequences, well filmed and choreographed, make this movie a lot of fun, as well as fairly action packed.   It even has a bit of a love story/sweet side to it that helped to keep my wife interested during all the neck-breaking, bullet-wizzing, stomach crunching fight scenes.    Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice action packed movie with a solid plot.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|There's some songs in other languages but they are very beautiful and moving. The songs in English are also meaningful. The music is relaxing yet draws you in. Josh has a way of bringing out emotions for his songs. I really recommend this album.
B00428CCPW|5.0|Very well packed, received in perfect condition and SUPER fast.  Thank YOU Amazon.    Love this album!  Whilst at first it was only \\"OK\\" with me, it's now my favourite Taylor Swift album.  I also have the ordinary CD (not the deluxe version).  I can thank this LP for tempting me into upgrading my turntable - was a SystemDek IIX/900/Rega RB300/Lyra Clavis cartridge, but soon will be a Clearaudio Champion Level II (with the same arm & cartridge for now).      If you haven't bought this record, do so!    Dave
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I want to give this movie zero stars, but I don't think Amazon will let me.    I don't understand how anyone would buy this film. I saw it in the movie theater with a couple of friends, and we almost left after about fifteen minutes. Unfortunately for me, one of the friends wanted to see the rest, so I had to suffer through it. I have enjoyed mindless entertainment. I saw Transformers and the A-Team in the theater as well. But this movie transcends mindless, going to the heights (or depths, depending on your world view) of mindless, soulless, plot-less, humorless and thoughtless entertainment.     I could stand Sylvester Stallone and his poor, plastic surgery damaged face, Jason Statham's caricature of an action hero, and Mickey Rourke's role as the emotional (!) center of the film. But the bad special effects, the nonexistent plot and dearth of humor made me more than just desirous of a refund, I was sad. Sad to see such a wonderful cast and an interesting premise rendered so very poorly.     During a scene in the middle of the film, (spoiler) when Mickey Rourke's character explains some of his emotional damage and starts to cry, and also drool (in extreme closeup), I doubt the writer and director expected the audience to laugh. But when I started laughing during this ridiculous scene, I couldn't stop, and that started my friends laughing too. Please don't buy this movie. Save your money for Red, a movie of ridiculous action, but one well-told and most importantly, funny in all the right places. Intentionally.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I purchased this used for my little sister. The packaging was far cooler than I would have expected! Even at its market price! The cover is hot-pink velvet and the pages of the \\"book\\" are wire-binded and have a metallicy-pearl sparkly printing. It looks really cool, even to me (I tend to be an action/kung fu/sci-fi/fantasy movie kind of a guy).<br /><br />I have only seen a few of the series's episodes, so I cannot accuratel review the content.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Stepping up from the phones that came with your iPod or other audio device? Want accurate reproduction across the range? Want to spend under $100 for some headphones that can hang with the more expensive stuff?<br /><br />Headphones are not normally something I get excited about but these are great. Initially I was a little turned off by what I perceived as excessive bass but after listening to a verity of music I came to realize it wasn't the headphones at all, I had grown so accustomed to the crappy little in the ear types that I was hearing a depth to the music that I was not getting before. I can hear nuance, not just down low but across the frequency range, that was inaudible with my other headphones.<br /><br />One small thing that bothered me about the set I received was I soon noticed a rattle that turned out to be a bit of solder inside the right housing. About two minutes work to remove it and no more rattle. Had it not been for that I would have rated them five stars. Still, if you are looking to upgrade your phones and want excellent audio quality for under $100 the Sony MDR-7506 are going to be hard to beat.<br /><br />(Paid $79.95 in November 2010.)
0439023513|1.0|Wee Little Spoiler included.<br />I truly enjoyed the first book in this trilogy. It was an exciting, fast-paced, five-star thriller that introduced a compelling world and an intriguing heroine. This writer is clearly capable of delivering a winner. Why, then, did she sink so low with Mockingjay? The book is confusing, oddly-paced, and littered with gratuitous violence and about as much character development as a block of wood. (Book 2, by the way, had problems--but they weren't as significant as the problems in Mockingjay.)<br /><br />Gale wins the prize for the most boring male lead in YA fiction. Does anyone even have a sense of his personality, other than he is strong and likes to hunt? Peeta is a bit better developed, but not by much. Throughout the book, characters are introduced, only to be quickly killed off. Not that one would care a wit about any of them.<br /><br />Much of the book is told in rambling summaries, and the author commits the sin of \\"telling rather than showing\\" on page after page, leaving me more enraged with every chapter. Had this been her first effort, I imagine it would have been soundly trounced by any reviewer. It is only because she published the first bestseller that this slapped-together nonsense was allowed to go to print.<br /><br />Half the time I was reading I felt lost and disoriented, and had to force myself to keep turning pages in the wan hope that somehow the author would pull the book out of the mire. The most odious part of the book for me was the almost complete disconnect from the characters, especially Katniss herself--who doesn't grow or change in any meaningful way. From heroes to evil villains, they were all cardboard cutouts without any depth, or even interesting personality traits that would make them memorable and compelling--the kind of characters that linger with you long after a book is closed. Snow and his odiferous white roses weren't scary, they were laughable. Coin was about as well-developed as a stump. All those annoying Romans and other citizens may as well have been named \\"extra 1\\" and \\"cannon fodder 2\\" for all that I cared. I sort of rooted for Finnick for a while (maybe he'd be a dark horse love interest? Peeta and Gale sure weren't doing it for me) but then, oops, his head gets torn off. Yucky!<br /><br />In short, this book was a big disappointment. Collins can do better. Her Gregor the Overlander books were charming, and I remember even feeling sad when a big cockroach in one of them gets killed. That she could get me to weep for a cockroach and then write characters like in Mockingjay...too bad.nd other citizens may as well have been named \\"extra 1\\" and \\"cannon fodder 2\\" for all that I cared.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|AMC is on a roll. Between this show, Mad Men and now The Walking Dead they've become the new powerhouse in cable television. This show ups the ante that the first season's groundwork laid, showing how a man that is essentially \\"good\\" has inherent characteristics to become \\"evil\\". While this is an oversimplification of the theme of this show it gives the viewer a good starting off point to understanding this show. Bryan Cranston proves himself to be one of the finest actors working these days, the real shame is that he hasn't been given roles to sink his teeth into before this one. What the first season lacked in depth this one makes up for sevenfold by showing the true faces of addiction and the devastating consequences associated with it. Overall this is must see television, on par with the finest of shows like the Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Mad Men and now Boardwalk Empire. Proving again that television is where it's at to tell the best stories in the truest of ways.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|This is a compelling story that makes you think about the implications of trying to splice genetic material for the sake of creating new life forms.  Because they are so unpredictable, anything can, and does, go wrong. Such is the case with Dren, a creature that has a stinger tail, legs like a kangaroo, a face like a human's, and even wings.    Poor Dren is unstable and cannot control her conflicting emotions and sexual attraction to Adrien Brody's character, as well as her changeable feelings towards Sarah Polley's character.      As one might imagine, all sorts of problems ensue. I won't spoil the movie by revealing them, but it is recommended viewing.
1594744475|5.0|This book is perfect for people who have just starting to make Cute Bento Boxes. It gives detailed instructions that are easy to follow and tips as well. It tells you all the different tools and items needed to make an adorable bento box. The book also includes recipes, not just how to make your food cute. It even gives you tips on making rice and onigiri (filled and unfilled). My boyfriend gave me this for Christmas (early) and I love it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes putting detail into their food (or friends', kids', loves') and looking at cute things. It's so easy to follow a ten year old could do it (with kitchen supervision).
0810994739|5.0|Christmas present to grandson was book 2 and book 5. He raised his hands and hollered a big Whoop. Thanks Wimpy Kid for being so much fun!
B000007MVD|5.0|Everything on this album is great, especially the cover versions, mostly on side one ( I don't really need more versions of the familiar Beatle songs); but it is worth buying for one track: John singing \\"Soldier of Love\\" (Arthur Alexander, swoon).  Why they never did this on an album is a mystery to me.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|What can I say? Always use Artic Silver 5 Compound. Easy to apply and keeps all my CPU's cool. Just get it and use it. Can't go wrong no matter what CPU your using. This just works period!
0312370849|5.0|The author has managed to get us to read about something that we would not normally care to think about.  I couldn't put the book down,  it managed to keep me distanced enough from the agony while still pulling me in deeper and deeper.  I think that the present day story was necessary to keep me from being swamped by the intensity of the subject matter.  Sarah's Key has reminded me that I went to the Holocaust Museum several years ago and I still have the identification cards that we received there.  I just looked through them again and so I have been a witness to those lives in the cards that were affected so deeply by the injustices that were done.  Thanks to Tatiana De Rosnay for reminding me.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|After years of knowing of their existence, but yet not actually listening to the music itself, now after all this time I see what I have been missing from 30 seconds to Mars. To make it short and sweet, the songs on this album are powerful and filled with amazing energy. Jared Leto truly has a talent in the arts for sure. If you like rock music, you will love this. I have already ordered and have high hopes for the This is War cd.
0767802624|5.0|MIB...Men In Black is a super film, that has comedy, plenty of action, and superb performances for this genre of film.    It is ten times better than MIB2....which was a disappointment...    Add it to your must have classic DVD movie collection...you can never go wrong with this movie, great for ALL AGES.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just the right size for my needs. Holds Canon 40D body with 17to70 zoom lens plus my 70 to 200 and my 50mm. I also carry my 580 flash, charger and straps in the main compartment. The other compartments hold all of the other things I like to carry with me. Straps on the outside allow me to carry my monopod. Pockets on the side are great for CF card holders and other small items. All in all it is just right for my needs.
B00000JZI9|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie...BUY IT NOW.    If you have seen the movie and don't have the DVD...BUY IT NOW.    This is a classic shootem up action western that should be in everyone's movie collection no matter what format!    Go get em Payton!
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I grew up with the A Team, so like previous reviewers, was hesitant to give this one a try because I thought it was going to be a cheesy remake. WRONG.     I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The action had me laughing out loud at times and I have to say, the actor playing Murdock was funnier than the original  -Dwight Shultz (and he was always my fave character)     For an 80's tv show remake, this was great. Acting was good, stunts were amazing. So yes, very enjoyable!
6305878323|2.0|Thought I had a classic..    Realized how dated and out of touch this whole sappy story really was.    But Julie Andrews certainly is way cute...and Dick Van Dyke is entertaining.....for him.    Don't bother adding this to your collection.    Sorry I wasted my money here.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is a great reflection of most people's life's. The lyrics they come up with are absolutely phenomenal, with great instrumentals to back them up! His screaming is different from others, and is one you just fall in love with! They help capture the true feeling behind the lyrics. I can't say enough about this band, especially this album. Don't judge because they're a so called \\"emo\\" band, emo is just short for emotional, and these songs are very emotional, and beautiful.
0790734850|5.0|I really don't want to do a movie review, but I can tell you that this film is another MUST HAVE and must watch for your DVD collection.    It is smartly written, pretty good acting with a neat twist at the end and plenty of action.    Russel Crowe before he was a big star!    Get it.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The additional footage and scenery are really amazing and adds to the understanding of the movie. The support discs provide an amazing amount of information about how the movie was developed.     Well worth the cost. Of course I am a confirmed addict of sci-fi but what the heck. Great product....
1572814349|5.0|This tarot can not miss in your collection<br /> the images are beautiful and very expressive<br /> And you can not have in your collection<br />a minha j&aacute; est&aacute; completa e voce?
B004AKCME8|5.0|The film adaptation of Kathryn Lasky's story was wonderful. It's a great family movie because those of any age should see this movie. It's warm, heartfelt message is a good one. The battle scenes are fantastic, too. Might be a bit overwhelming for those under 6, but otherwise not too scary for the wee ones. I saw it with my 9 and 14 year olds and we all loved it!
B004EJ14V2|5.0|This was a great performance by Emma Stone and she was supported by a great cast. This movie is really worth seeing!
B001BNFR6W|5.0|You can complain all you want if you don't like this show but I loved it. It was groundbreaking in many ways. It made me laugh and cry and I enjoyed it immensely. I will enjoy my new collectors set when it arrives.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|The product is not bad. I got it as a gift and she loves it. It really deserve more like a 3.75, closer to 4 but not quite. I would recommend buying it. Bass is a little weak, its really a \\"clear\\" headphone. Really closer for what DJs want than for audiophiles. The acoustics and resonance is weak and it absolutely does not filter out any sound. I have a pair of Audio Technica A700s and I like those way more and would totally recommend them more.[[ASIN:B000E9VKUQ Audio Technica ATH-A700 Headphones]]
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I needed a new, longer HDMI cable, but considered going back to my old 13 inch black and white with rabbit ears when I saw how much Wal*Mart, Target and Bestbuy were all charging for these.  Didn't even think about looking at Amazon for this until I saw it on my recommendations list, picked it up super cheap and have been incredible pleased with it ever since.
1844281116|4.0|Son loved it! part of his book club at school he was intrigued with the fact finding and the way the plot developed.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I didn't exactly what to expect from this series. I am a huge fan of the \\"Sword and Sandal\\" genre, and I decided to check this out on Netflix. I was blown away! The action is great and only gets more and more superb as the series goes on. The dialouge is suprisingly good and the plot is AMAZING!!! The plot twists and suprises kept me waiting to see the next episode every time.      Do not miss out on this Epic show. The action is as brutal as it is Beautiful. The story is awesome and the plot is actually driven by emotion more than pure action.      In short, SPARTACUS RULES!!!!!!!!
1400079144|2.0|I brought this book when it first came out because I was a fan of The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons.  Simply put, this novel just went overboard with its lengthy monologues, preachy undertone, and lecture-like 'revelations'.  A complete disappointment and waste of money!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Jim Carey sometimes goes over the top in his movies.  This time he stopped just at the edge.  I was suprised when the \\"how it wa made\\" showed the real Carey doing the acting for the movie.  Kudos to Careyand the movie.
030746363X|3.0|Tim is clever. That makes this book a must read.    The content is -at least partially- dangerous. People who are limited intelligent enough to get \\"fat\\", may ruin their body even more trying to get \\"slim\\": Get fit or die trying!    Tim has an idea, how to get fit. It worked for himself - but he is very aware of side-effect and has alot of knowledge and experience dealing with his \\"OWN BODY\\". The readers may not.    Thus: This is the biggest FIELD TEST in medical history. The reader of \\"4-Hour-Body\\" will deliver, based on Tim's ideas, positive AND negative results. This is - without being under medical control - dangerous. Period.    Be aware - even there maybe no fun in life without taking some risks.    Again: Must read.
B004AKCME8|5.0|do not listen to the movie critics this is a great film for all ages. it is a well told story with all the charactors geting good screen time. basicly it is a standard plot bad guys want to take over kingdom the two main charactors going to get the guardians to help them free their kingdom. I recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of good animation. it is well worth a look!
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is it baby. THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD and they can prove it. I only wish Mick Taylor would never have quit. The music they created between 1967 and 1974 is the absolute rawest rock ever. This dvd captures them at their peak before they became so filthy rich they didn't have to put their souls into it. This is much better quality than my old vhs of the same. Weather you are a fan or not no r&r band has ever been this good nor ever will be. Saw it live in '72 and at the theater. Buy it, watch it loud, enjoy it. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book as a recommendation by a friend who knows I loved the Harry Potter Series as well as the Twilight Saga. As much as I can honestly say the books are NOTHING alike, it was a riveting story. I enjoyed the character development, and they continue to develop over the next two books in the series (I LOVE PEETA). I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story, however warn that this book along with it's sequals, are very disturbing at points. Like the title of my review states, it's amazing but SICK. I don't know how Suzanne Collins came up with this!!
0061733199|4.0|Pretty decent book learned a few things already. For the cos vs the amount of info you get it's a great buy.
0545265355|5.0|These books are fantastic!  Fast moving, can't put them down.  I read all three in a weekend and got mad at myself for going through them too quickly.  I originally bought them for my teenaged granddaughter.
0345505387|2.0|My students love graphic novels, but I don't.  I find the pictures in my head from reading text are so much richer than any graphic novel.  It's more like a motion picture for me.  Perhaps if I had not read and reread the original, I would not be so disappointed.  I'll stick to text from now on.
B0047VEE0U|5.0|I need to start this review by saying that I do like the Harry Potter soundtrack and what Alexandre Desplat did with it.    The whole set is in an attractive box, that when opened up has a smaller box in it with a picture of Hogwarts burning. On this is a certificate of authenticity, informing me that I have the 192nd copy of 10000. The lid opens up, to show the actual contents.     The inside of the box has a picture of the forest in which Harry runs away from Snatchers. The CDs, DVD and booklet are put into holders here. Next to it, you can find the poster, autographed sheet music (a part of Detonators for me, with Alexandre Desplat's signature on it), the vinyl record and the film cells.     The poster is standard. I haven't got a chance to check the vinyl record out yet. But the CDs have the amazing score that Alexandre Desplat wrote for this film. There are also bonus tracks that weren't used in the film and were not even in the regular soundtrack release. The bonus tracks are good too. They include: Voldemort, Grimmauld Place, The Dumbledores, The Tale of the Three Brothers, Bellatrix, and My Love is Always Here. These bonus tracks fit in with the theme of other songs which were included in the movie and regular soundtrack release like Ron Leaves, and Lovegood.     I have already review the music on the regular soundtrack page, but here's a short review. The music really makes me remember the parts of the movie that they go with. Obliviate is a wonderful example of this. It is a much better tune to start the movie than Hedwig's Theme, because it really has an emotion of a dark thing coming up, and the fact that the trio is preparing to leave, especially with Hermione obliviating her parents. Polyjuice Potion, the first time Hedwig's Theme is featured, Lovegood and Detonators are more upbeat while there are also the sadder songs like Dobby and Ron Leaves, and fast paced action sequence tunes like Sky Battle, Fireplaces Escape, and Captured and Tortured. The music is very emotion-evoking.     This will make a wonderful gift to a Harry Potter fan, or a lover of soundtracks. It is a little expensive, but it was worth it for me.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Annie still has one of the best voices in the business, and it is shown off well in this beautiful album.  She makes the old Christmas songs her own.  I just got the album this afternoon and have already run it through three times.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing dropped the temperature of an AMD 965 black edition to 32C! A full 10 degree improvement over the stock AMD cooler.  Although it's kind of a pain to install. You have to take the motherboard out to mount it. It's the best deal and performance around. Recommended, highly, for reducing temperature and fan noise. If you have a quad core, this is the cooler.  I recommend you use Arctic Silver heat sink compound, instead of the grease that comes with it. The compound that is included is kind of cheap quality.
006117758X|5.0|Ham on Rye is a book I've had kicking around the house for awhile but only got around to reading it this autumn. I thought--as an autobiography of Buk's early life--it would be dreary and depressing. I am pleased to report that I was totally wrong. Ham on Rye isn't disheartening but it is an incredibly poignant tale.<br /><br />Here Bukowski's writing is excellent; perhaps superior to anything else he penned at any other point in his career. His first memory was of being under a table...and we progress from there. I was reminded of a line from the musician Beck, \\"at a time of chimpanzees I was a monkey,\\" after reading that the author's dad bought him an Indian suit with accompanying bow and arrow...at a time when all the other kids wore cowboy outfits. It seems such an outcome was Buk's destiny. His father also discouraged him from reading books and ridiculed his early WWI based stories revolving around the figure of a neo-Red Baron.<br /><br />Buk grew up during the depression and his portrait of those days is something that most of us--born citizens within an America of bounty--will have difficulty imagining. People in those days had three mortgages, and instead of selling new shoes the department stores sold heels and glue in order to maintain the ones you already had. Each child possessed two pairs of pants: one for Sundays and the second for the other six days of the week. When you get to page 95 (chapter 22) that marks Buk's first illicit drink you long to hit the delete key in order to prevent the main character's descent into an addiction that largely poisoned his life. But, as you'd expect, the tale of Baldy and he drinking from barrels wine is fascinating...as are all the vignettes included in this underrated masterpiece. If you read only one book by Buk, this is the one I'd recommend.
B002O5M4SA|1.0|This movie dresses and grooms a 12-year-old girl as a sex object instead of a child and then portrays her characters as having strong sexual desires for an unattractive middle aged man. People seem to say this is \\"OK\\" because the film \\"Isn't about that\\" and because \\"the middle aged character continues to reject her sexual advances.\\"  I say, look at the implications. This film implies that there are beautiful pre-pubescent girls who have a strong sexual desires for gone-to-seed middle aged men. Sexual predators, no matter how repulsive, often act upon the fantasy that their victim desires them. This film played into that fantasy and after a while, I had to turn it off.
0060853972|5.0|Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman is hilarious and a wonderful ride.  From the first page to the last, it is constant fun- I thoroughly enjoyed this description of Armaggedon.  If you don't know the authors, think of doomsday as done by Monty Python- only with actual plot.  Quick, easy read- and many interesting characters.  I read this and started recommending to all of my friends.
B00154GEFU|2.0|Just so you understand my bias, here's a bit about me.  I love Asia's debut album but couldn't get beyond listening to samples of Astra or Alpha.  Until yesterday I didn't know there were a slew of albums released since.  But the thought of Phoenix has always intrigued me because I'm a big Yes and ELP fan and I always thought Asia put a good edge on Howe's sound.<br /><br />And the sounds _are_ good but very reminiscent of their debut album - whether it's the vocal harmonies, the rhythms or much of the guitar work.  I was hoping for something new from them - you'd expect some masters of prog rock to have some great stuff 25 years after their debut.  As the album goes on I was less and less impressed.  Whether it was hearing the rehashed Howe licks or the awkward lyrics I'm not sure, but none of the songs are \\"great\\" to my ears, some are only \\"listenable while doing chores\\" and others are simply lackluster.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay full price for this cd, but if you just want to hear what they came up with you could do worse (luckily it's no Chicken Foot).
B00192IV9U|5.0|i absolutely LOVE this album! i wish some fans would quit with the drama and just enjoy and appreciate michael's music.  yes, it's so sad he's not here, but anything with him in it is worth 100 stars!! i think this is a solid effort and i want to personally thank the estate and sony music for bringing us a new michael jackson album. we've all been hungry for one, and in my opinion, each song is a top 10 hit. i'm really surprised katy perry, queen of auto-tune, is #1 on the hot 100 and hold my hand only peaked at #50. i love that song. to the entire mj fan community, pls. get the album and just enjoy it. there's no need to diss it, this is still his work and i think michael himself would appreciate his fans enjoying his music.

B00275EHJG|4.0|I have 2 sons, 2 and 5 years old.  They love this movie now, but the first time they saw it, it scared them.  The new characters in the movie such as the bear and the monkey are mean.  I started to let them watch it alone while I was cleaning and had my 2 year old come crying running toward me in fear when the monkey was pounding his symbols.  After sitting through the movie and reassuring him that it was ok and there was nothing to be afraid of they were fine watching it for the second, third, fourth time...you get the idea.  They love it now.  I cried 3 times during the movie.  There were some very touching moments that make you emotional for these toys as if they were real.  We are glad that we bought it and my boys enjoy acting out the movie with their toys, just be sure to watch it with them for the first time if they are younger.

0385338910|4.0|I read this on a plane and it didn't make me hate myself. It's chicklit for guys (and maybe for gals too) but it's quite well done with real characters who have real dilemmas (or semi-real ones).<br /><br />The plot: Doug Parker is 29 and widowed. His wife, several years older (but still gorgeous and sexy) died in a plane crash leaving him alone in suburbia, surrounded by sexy singles and slutty married women all waiting for him to get over his loss enough to get back in the game.<br /><br />But Doug is devastated. There is also his wife's 16-year, deeply disturbed son, longing for attention and love, and Doug's own dysfunctional family.<br /><br />Can Doug heal fast enough to put his life and the lives of those around him back together?<br />Can Doug find love again?<br />Can Doug grow up and become a real adult?<br /><br />No prizes for correct answers but it's fun finding out.

1433502410|5.0|This is an excellent study Bible to have. It is the most \\"essentially literal\\" translation of the Bible to date. (It's equivalent of a 20-volume Bible resourece library. It's excellent commentary explains the Greek translation and meaning - as oppossed to many Bibles giving a Greek word definition but not telling us how it was used, Like is said, the deepest way to study a Bible.     My suggestion is to go to a book store before you buy ANY BOOK and check it over. The only complaint i could see one having of this book is it's big size - not huge but the size of a bigger Bible.    Great Bible - A pastor's must!!!    P.S. - it includes online resources to esvonline.org
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I watched this movie with a few friends at work one night. It was like watching a funeral and a train wreck happen simultaneously. Characters lack depth and are flatter than paper; Bella gets showered with praise and puts it off as if everybody hates her and she's very unpopular. I could not hate a movie or a characters more than this movie.

0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the first book in the Dragonlance Chronicles Series.  I'm writing this review after revisiting this book.  I originally read this series at the start of 2010.  The book was every bit as good the second time through.    I believe this is one of the first novels the authors collaborated on.  The writing at points seems a little unrefined, especially early in the book, but by the end is really solid.  I love how the Weis/Hickman team build worlds with geography and history to them.  Everything seems incredibly well thought out - this is no more true than when it comes to Krynn - this world the authors have created is their crowning achievement.  And the characters they've created are classics that you will remember fondly your entire life.    The pacing to this book is about the only real problem I have with it, especially when you compare it to the second book of the series - Dragons of Winter Night.  Autumn Twilight is a great book, don't get me wrong, but when you compare it to the rest of the series it's much more dull, by comparison.    Still though, a few minor problems aside, this is epic fantasy at it's finest.    5 Stars.

B002SQKQHQ|5.0|A story of human perseverance and endurance that overcomes oppression and eventually leads to freedom on this scale is extremely hard to believe. Many prisoners of the Gulags chose to escape rather than suffer the labor camps and certain death. Given the odds, and numbers who did escape the prisons and labor camps, I believe it is plausible for a group to survive a trek such as this. Was it Rawicz? We will truly never know. I was disappointed to learn that a BBC investigation in 2006 showed that Rawicz was a fake. However, in 2009 a gentleman named Witold Glinski told the BBC that it was he and not Rawicz who led the escape to India. The former Soviet Union was also wonderful at spreading and disseminating fiction from fact. So, the BBC investigation may have uncovered false Soviet documentation. However, I can't overcome some of the impossibilities such as crossing the Gobi desert for 16 days with little to no water and food, and crossing the Himalayas in their condition. The sighting of the large fury creatures \\"Yeti\\" was the killer for me. I still would like to believe, but seriously have my doubts. A remarkable quote from this book is \\"when lost, freedom is difficult to regain.\\" That quote holds true for many men and women who have suffered through political oppression throughout the world.     Basically, The Long Walk is a nice piece of historical fiction.

0061998494|3.0|As an insight to Craig Ferguson, this is an interesting and amusing read. Only if you're a fan of his antics on TV, however.    If you don't know Craig's work on tv and pick this book up, you're going to find a rather rambling autobiography that, while having some fun anecdotes, doesn't tie together into a cohesive expression at any point in the narrative. Without having 1st hand knowledge of Craig's personality traits and mannersims, the narrative really doesn't have alot of punch.    But if you are a fan, pick up this book as a good supplement to his personality.
B001TIQT98|5.0|Aside from the Japanese SACDs that came out a few years ago (I have the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th & 9th on SACD and they are way too expensive) this version of the complete set is as good as it gets (at least for now).    Blows the original set away in terms of sound quality, and for the current price ($37.99 as of December 21, 2010) you can't go wrong at all.

0439023513|4.0|I agree with a few of the reviews here that the ending is not perfect and some of the story lines are quickly ended, with not much exploration into motives.  However, I do think this was a great book.  I could not put it down.  There is so much that was great about this book as it went darker and characters fell off the edge, much more complex than the first novels.  The action sequences were just as good, if not better than the first two books.   In the end, I think you rate a book on how much you enjoyed it, was it entertaining and did it leave you thinking.  The answer is yes to all three.  Four stars.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I've waited for this DVD release seemingly forever.  I had captured each video via YouTube, but you know what that's like.  The combination CD and DVD is the best bargain in town.  The sound quality is excellent.  I wish the DVD also included the video \\"I Want Tomorrow,\\" but, oh well.<br /><br />After listening to Enya's CDs and watching her perform in postage-stamp-sized images, I could not help but fall in love with this epitome of femininity.  Enya's ethereal voice, the creativity of her music, physical beauty and graceful gestures/movements were not like anything I had ever encountered.  The combination zapped what Carl Jung referred to as a man's anima.  Watching the full-screen DVD brought back many of these early infatuations.  I fully realize that my imagination was spurred on by the exposure to pure beauty.  This is what lures many men into extramarital affairs or simply misguided relationships.  The beauty of a woman will trump any man's reasoning every time.  This desire of men to embrace beauty is poorly understood by both men and women.  Non-cerebral males will hardly even reflect on their motivations.  If anything, they may regard it as plain lust.  Women view the male's wandering eye with a kind of disgust.  Should the male somehow consummate his quest for beauty (however temporary), his concubine/mate will simply comprehend his actions as deliberate betrayal.  Her anger will be brought to full bloom, and woe to anyone on the receiving end of this emotion.<br /><br />Luckily for me my \\"betrayal\\" was limited to a computer-generated voice and image of a beguiling but unknown performer.  I would like to know more about Enya.  I'd like to have coffee with her and explore her personality.  In reality I know none of this will occur.  I will never jump her bones or discover any intimate details about her existence.  It's a pity because I'd have lots of questions to ask, including why she chose never to marry.  Maybe someday someone will write a biography about this marvelous woman, and I'll be happy with that.  I will only know Enya as a product -- a bewitching lady with a superb marketing agency.  And that's okay too.  I can live with my own enthrallment and simply bless the entertainer for infiltrating my heart with yearnings and joy.elous woman, and I'll be happy with that.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|What a time in music. In 1971, two of the greatest rock and roll bands were working on masterpieces at the same time. Pete Townsend and The Who were working on what was then known as Lifehouse and The Rolling Stones were working on Exile On Main Street. Townsend was working on an incredibly ambitious concept album centering around the theme that, if there was an ultimate truth in the world, it would not be a verbal idea but a musical note. At the same time, The Stones, with business and tax problems leaving them broke and homeless at the height of their career, were working around no concept whatsoever, just going with the flow. And what were the results? Pete's grandiose concept was eventually abandoned, and what emerged out of the wreckage of trying to find life's answer was one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time, Who's Next. And Exile On Main Street? It aimed for nothing, and perhaps ended up hitting upon maybe the truth Pete was looking for. If there is an ultimate truth in life, Exile on Main Street is as close as we'll ever come in Rock Music. I'm in my early 40s, and so I am too young for 60s style optimism, and like most of my generation, Sgt. Pepper is nothing to me but a pretty idea. That said, I am also technically too young for Exile On Main Street, as I never heard it until 1991. Yet it moves me like no album I have ever heard. And only now do I know why. As the country descends into an ever deepening economic and social malaise, and we are left looking back wondering \\"Was everything we believed wrong?\\" I've lost faith in most ideas, yet not in the message of \\"Exile\\" It takes a certain person to \\"Get it\\" just as it takes a certain kind of person to \\"Get\\" the Bible. For me, it's exactly what Rock and Roll is. I don't want to rank it, categorize it, or judge it. I just want to listen to it. It makes me want to sip whiskey (I don't like whiskey), smoke cigarettes (I don't smoke) and sing the incoherent lyrics. At many times in my life, it's the best answer there is. Try it. And if you don't \\"get it\\" the first time, try it again a few years later when things don't seem quite so clear anymore. It's dirty, messy, sad, and chaotic. And, at just the right times, incredibly beautiful.

0385342047|1.0|I'm a Sophie Kinsella fan and have read all her books. I started reading Shopaholic series in my 20's and have \\"grown up\\" with Becky. Every book starts out the same, with Becky rationalizing her spending sprees until her addiction gets way out of hand. The situation explodes and she learns her \\"lesson\\"  and vows never to do it ever again. But since this is the 5th book, it is clear that she has never really learned anything. What has started as \\"cute\\" and \\"relatable\\" is now annoying and irritating. I'm a mom with small children now as well and I cannot stand the way she \\"mothers\\". I know she has a big heart but you'd think she'd try to be more mature now that she's a mother.      The first chapter is excruciating to read. I finally skimmed the rest of the book and just read the last chapters. I have NEVER done this before ever. I'm never going to read another Shopaholic series again. It's time that Becky grows up.

1441866868|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's epic novel of future Thailand seems like the sort of thing that could be a description of how we live in the very near future.  Set some hundreds of years after the collapse of oil and the rising of the oceans, humanity has just begun to reestablish global trade using great sailing ships and dirigbles.  The most precious of all resources is the calorie, as living beings powered by food & water are the most portable energy source available in a world without carbon fuel.<br /><br />The story throws us straight into the life of a calorie-man, the employee of a North American super-corporation who is secretly spying upon the homegrown food of Thailand.  You see, most natural foods have been wiped out, either by accidental plagues, or the occasional purpouseful scourge desgined to increase demand for genetically modified foods.  In this environemnt a seed bank of uncontaminated crops is more valuable, and more powerful, than nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Calorie-man Anderson's story of industrial espionage and hard-scrabble surivival on the mean streets of Bangkok is contrasted with the stories of a idealistic government enviornmental enforcer, Jaidee.  Jaidee is famous for defying the corporations and his own government's trade ministry in his relentless dedication to environmental protections.  Imagine if Dirty Harry worked for the EPA, and you have something close.  He fearlessly burns illegal food imports, and his squads beat violators without pity.  He has many enemies, foreign corporations and power hungry factions of the Thai government, and his loyal number 2 Kanya may not be what she seems.<br /><br />Weaving throughout these stories are other characters, including the eponymous Windup Girl, a Japanese \\"New Person,\\" genetically engineered to be a better version of humanity, but crippled by genetic and indoctrinated obedience and submission.  Emiko, the Windup Girl, is conditioned to be the perfect servent, but even genetic conditioning can be weakened by a lifetime of abuse and humiliation.  She dreams of escaping Bangkok to find a rumored settlement of free New People, deep in the plague-ravanged jungles.<br /><br />Bacigalupi extrapolates the current tensions between the have & have-not nations, the environmental fears, and the unsolved energy problems to create a world that seems both alien and familiar.  He doesn't invent some magical new technology to save the planet.  Instead, human ingenuity and perserverence are the only things that keep people alive in the face of an increasingly hostile environment.  Everything is harder that it used to be, and the people all know it.  There are dreams of a return to the old ways before the collapse of global energy, but most of the time people are content to simply get by without being killed by a plague, or in the crossfire of government and corporations.  Bacigalupi's prose is simple and evocative, making you feel the contrast between the relentless humidity and filth of the Bangkok slums and the cool, clean technology that still exists deep within corporate offices.<br /><br />Jonathan Davis reads the story with passion and eloquence, keeping the hard to pronounce Thai names clear and easy to follow for my American ears.  He gives each character a distinctive voice, and it is never hard to follow the reading.  The audio edition also includes an introduction by Bacigalupi, who describes the genesis of the novel from a fever-dream experience in a South Asian hotel room.e of abuse and humiliation.

B0034G4OVS|1.0|This movie is a classic example of a good idea that is ruined by a lack of creativity on what to do with it.<br /><br />Being trapped on a chair lift is something that anyone who's ever ridden on has pondered.  If you have, you probably have as many theories as I do about how you would extract yourself from that situation.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers lack the creativity to figure out how to make even this good idea last a mere 93 minutes.  Instead, after a genuinely tense 30 minutes or so, the film introduces wolves.  Yes, wolves.  Because being trapped on a chairlift overnight in a blizzard isn't really that scary, so we need to introduce a way to possibly be eaten.  At that point the film, which up to there had me engrossed in it's tension, totally lost me.  A pack of wolves?  On a ski resort?  In New England?!<br /><br />From there on out the movie just becomes more and more tedious and boring, and every time it gets the most extremely boring, the wolves show up again, as the plot devices that they are.<br /><br />This movie sucks.

0743298039|4.0|The writing itself was very lush, very vivid, lacking the \\"awkwardness\\" of new authors without slipping into purple prose. A wonderful mystery novel. I definitely did not foresee the twist at the ending. The author creates such strange, yet compelling, yet wholly believable characters.

This gothic tale is reminiscent of the classic gothic novels, namely Bronte's works, Uncle Silas, etc.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Can't add much to the positive reviews already resident on this excellent story featuring Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law.  Entertaining sums it up for me!  This is one of those movies where you can test yourself to see what you see (and what you don't) in trying to keep up with the clues provided!  I finally broke down and bought the DVD.  It's currently in rotation on HBO.  Now, I can watch it when I want!<br /><br />My favorite scene is where Sherlock Holmes gets with a gypsy woman to tell Watson's fortune.  He's sucked in, but after awhile he figures out that he's been had, but the lines that crack me up are:<br /><br />Gypsy woman: (the gypsy woman is referring to Watson's fiancee, Mary in this exchange) Oh, she's got a beard, and, oh, she's covered in warts!!<br /><br />To which Sherlock Holmes deadpans:  Are they extensive??<br /><br />That scene cracks me up everytime I watch it (and I've seen this move 20 times already, before I purchased the DVD)!<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel!  Robert Downey strikes gold again in this role. Kudos are also due the special effects in restoring turn-of-the-century London, down to the construction of the London Bridge, with it's combination Suspension/Cantilever design (a first, I believe)!<br /><br />Get your copy and have fun (as I have)!<br /><br />What to rate this movie?  Quite elementary actually - Five stars!

The major value in this book is, as Tim writes, that he is a \\"dark horse.\\" 4HB combines information from many different disciplines that ordinarily wouldn't mingle. Practical information with no fluff from a creative \\"3rd\\" viewpoint.     The chapters skim the surface of various fields of study (i.e. ART, Egoscue) to just give you the information that you need. There are resources in the book to dig deeper if you are interested, but hey, that's what Google is for.
B0047VR1ZU|4.0|While the acting and stories were wonderfully done, the periodic shifts to space with text explanations were both disruptive and hokey, to say the least.  I kept thinking of Space Odyssey every time it happened and wondered where the monolith was.  They ruined what was otherwise an impeccable film.  You could really see and feel the different perspectives of each character.
B0041T52S6|5.0|It is a darn shame that a movie this good should have had such a lackluster run at the box office.  On the surface it probably appealed to a rather narrow target audience, but that would be wrongly judging a book by its cover.  Some reviews said that only teens and early-20-somethings would like this, but I'm 34 and I love it.  It is still a solid movie that deserves more credit--in box office receipts and critical acclaim--that it got.    If you read or at least skim the graphic novels by O'Malley, you will like the fact that the movie adheres to the books closely.  For some graphic novels this is a curse but for \\"Scott Pilgrim\\" it is a good thing (plug for books).  The music in here is awesome (plug for soundtrack).  Plus, I think asian chicks are H-O-T, and Ellen Wong is very easy to look at.    My one reservation is that, while I like Michael Cera's downbeat acting style and pretty much own everything he's starred in, he isn't the ideal actor for this role.  The books have a Scott who's more assertive while Michael Cera's portrayal is anything but (except for the fight scenes--here he kicks butt).    My vote: get this movie, and don't let it collect dust on your shelf.

B0021L8V0W|5.0|I was hesitant when I viewed the trailer for this movie. An assumption I quickly retracted five minutes into this film. Jolie shows that she is an A list actress to be contended with. Being able to star in an action film, primarily alone, with such great conviction is something to be proud of. Whether you are younger or older. A fan of Jolie or not. There is something for each individual. I hope, based on the ending, they are leaving room for a sequel. The perfect holiday gift!
1439107955|5.0|This is an excellent review of the history of cancer treatment including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies and the individuals involved in these advances.  The book is very well written and should be very approachable to almost any reader.  History is told in story form and the personalities of those involved are used to make the book captivating.  I am a young cancer researcher myself and feel I have previously missed out on the importance historical context of the current directions of research.  The book provides a new perspective with which to view the world of cancer.
1401228801|5.0|Reason for Reading: Next in the series.<br /><br />This was a fantastic volume! We are at the beginning of something new for the Fables and this volume just barely starts to put things in motion but it's main focus is to introduce us to some new main players, namely \\"the bad guys\\" out there and the Witches, the former residents of floor 13 whom so far we've heard mention but only met their leader Frau Totenkinder. We start off with a two-issue story that takes us back into the Dark Man's history, who he is, and how he was caught in the first place. So now we know just what a formidable foe the Fables are up against.<br /><br />Then we are off for the five title chapters which deal with the Witches of Fable. The residents of the 13th floor, some of whom we get to meet for the very first time. Frau Totenkinder is off on a secret mission and two Witches are vying for her place as new leader after her sudden disappearance. Here we meet up again with other familiar magical creatures such as Bufkin, Baba Yaga and Geppetto all regaining major roles, whom we haven't seen for some time now. There are also new magic wielders introduced. This is an exciting set-up for the new storyline which isn't fully unveiled yet but we have an inkling of the direction and certainly know who will be taking on major roles. I'm very excited about the direction of this new major story arc. Of course, everybody's minor storylines are all briefly visited upon during this time as well, keeping the general flow going. Finally the book ends with 2-issues back in the Homelands with a visit and a crisis in the Kingdom of Haven and its King, Flycatcher. This story doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the volume but it does advance both Flycatcher and Riding Hood's characters and story arcs.<br /><br />All and all, a very enjoyable issue for me that felt fresh and exciting as we go forward into a new era for the Fables

B000067CIJ|4.0|The Scottish ABBA. Bridges bubblegum, the pattycake fun of early 60s girl groups but has solid 70s production which makes it an almost all new thing. The studio tricks to make her harmonize with herself are interesting but it is the early 70s proto glam rock production on the backing band that really make this stand out in time. The song \\"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\\" is the near perfect simple rhyme and rhythm handclap stupidness that borders on transcendence. Pop music to pet warm puppies by. Usually this type of pop would only be made on the continent, where English was a second, third or fourth language, it is that cheesy. Like professionally bottled sunshine.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Don't know why some folks are hating this CD, since there is nothing at all horrible about it, and any true MJ fan could tell you that it is in fact Michael Jackson who is actually singing all these songs.  I debated whether I should download this from amazon or itunes, but cost-wise (at the time I pre-ordered it, the price for this was $8.99), it made much more sense to just buy the CD instead of paying $1.29 for each song.  Unless there is only one-three songs from here that you really like, then I say it's definitely better to buy the entire CD.  My favorite songs on here are Monster, Hollywood Tonight, Keep Your Head Up, (I Like) The Way You Love Me, (I Can't Make It) Another Day and Hold My Hand.  And if you get the CD, it comes with a booklet that has the lyrics (minus any rap though) so that was nice as well.  If you are a fan of MJ, then go get this - this should be in your collection, as it is surely worth it!!
0446195529|1.0|Like many others here, I say save your money and time and skip this book.  The Author just never got it together.  It is slow, ponderous, stupid, inactive, and predictable.  I've read all of DB's other books, but this is likely the last one I'll buy.  He's out of gas, as is his Camel Club series...
B00000DHR0|5.0|I purchased this CD specifically because it contained \\"The Prayer.\\" My purchase attained my aspirations. I do not understand the lyrics sung in Italian, but they only added to the prayer-like atmosphere that the song inspires in me. Ms. Dion inspires me to relax and let the Holy Spirit lead me where I need to go.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk, I was torn--should I wish for the old, or embrace the new?<br /><br />I'm pleased with this score:  its sound may not carry the most recognizable musical themes I remember from the original, but the tone of Daft Punk's score is well matched to the world of Tron just the same.  Consider it more faithful to the *spirit* of Carlos' original score and you'll be happy.  There are sweeping synth passages that pulse and build in intensity (\\"Recognizer\\"), digital coughs and blips lifted straight out of an '80s arcade, and all of it is arranged in a way that clearly belongs in the film.  Strings blend excellently into the mix, such as the tracks \\"Outlands\\" and \\"Flynn Lives\\".<br /><br />Sometimes a soundtrack--particularly one by a mainstream artist--can be more about promoting the artist than it is about the movie (for  example, the \\"Spawn\\" soundtrack was more about making two bands collaborate for each song and pulling music from multiple genres).  Daft Punk are very focused on the task at hand:  they create a sonic soundscape that reminds me why Vangelis' \\"Chariots of Fire\\" took the mainstream by storm--\\"The Grid\\", \\"Arena\\" and \\"Rinzler\\" are very similar.  The music to Tron: Legacy sounds just retro enough to hearken back to 1980 while just appealing enough to not sound stale today.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good sampling of what's here, listen to the passage from \\"Nocture\\" to \\"End of Line\\" to \\"Derezzed\\" to \\"Fall\\".  If you want one of the few moments the score sounds most like Daft Punk, that would be \\"Solar Sailor\\".  And if you are considering the digital download, yes you do get the booklet.  It doesn't show as available in the track listing but when you download you will receive a digital copy of the booklet in PDF form.<br /><br />NOTE:  the downloadable MP3 album from Amazon contains one bonus track.  However, reviewers are stating that the downloadable version(s) available from other Amazon stores (such as in the UK at Amazon.co.uk) offer a larger \\"2 disc\\" version of the album.  A completist might want to mull over the difference and download that version instead.  I'm not sure how the exchange rate factors into such a purchase, so if you're not from the UK, keep that in mind.rger \\"2 disc\\" version of the album.

B0036EBARO|1.0|There's a reason this is the lowest rated album by Goldfrapp. Whether you like this album or not will be dictated by how you feel about 80s synth-pop. And not the edgy, atmospheric 80s sound that has influenced some of their previous music -- think mindless, peppy, Top 40 bubblegum pop you might hear at a cheerleader rally. Consistent through Goldfrapp's previous four albums has been their ability to create infectious and at times beautiful tunes, and you can even hear some of that talent in these songs. Unfortunately, it's all buried under a thick layer of retro, saccharine production, and for the most part the lyrics are what you might expect a 13 year old to scribble on her lunch napkin. It's hard to know if this album represents an ironic pose or a calculated attempt at selling units, but whatever the intent, listening to it is like eating a plateful of Twinkies -- it's good for the first minute, then leaves you feeling queasy, unfulfilled, and sorry you ever had the idea in the first place. One good song somehow was accidentally included (Hunt), but if you're not familiar with this group, please try any of their other albums before listening to this. Here's hoping they execute yet another stylistic about-face on their next outing; just about anything would be better than this.
B002ZG98LO|3.0|This movie is pretty good so far.  I just got to the part where they show the Predators.  It's basically just all demons hunting the group of like 8 guys.  I only saw bits and parts of the original predators, but Arnold did a good acting job in that movie.  I heard good things about this movie so I thought I'd watch it.  I was afraid it would be too gory, but honestly it's not bad at all compared to Ninja Assassin which I just saw.  Ninja Assassin had an awesome storyline and superb actors, but the gore in that movie is pretty much unbearable.  Anyways, if your afraid of the gore in this movie, don't be it really isn't as bad as you think.  There are a few spots where it is, but nothing horrible.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|Amidst Christmas shopping and other holiday chores, my wife and caught \\"Tron: Legacy\\" over the past weekend, and we both enjoyed it. It was a pretty good movie, much more layered and nuanced than the original \\"Tron\\". Interestingly, even with all the flashy graphics and 3D effects, the movie is ultimately the story of a father and a son.<br /><br />I had heard that the emotional content of the film was an 11th hour contribution, when an early cut of the movie proved too cold. But, I don't know, the film's emotional themes seemed pretty well integrated into the story, so if they were later additions, it was all done skillfully.<br /><br />In a nod to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", which bracketed a spectacular color story with a black & white opening and closing, \\"Tron: Legacy\\" opens and closes with flat, 2D scenes, which serve to emphasize the spectacular 3D middle section, which makes up the bulk of the film. And, by all means, if you're going to see the film, see it in 3D. The 3D is sharp, clean, very cool, and used well.
B0017XFBMG|4.0|This is a really interesting and highly enjoyable compilation of early versions and songs you wouldn't expect to hear by the Pogues.

If you love relationships then this  is for you. By all means check this out you'll enjoy yourself to the fullest.

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I bought this movie set because I have band of brothers and I wanted to more or less get this movie as a companion set. I was slightly dissappointed after watching all the movie, guess maybe I was expecting it to be as good or better then B.o.B., as with world war  2 both theaters of operation were diffent, same with these movies. I just could not relate to the characters in \\"Pacific\\" seemed as if it jumped around to much, people came and went, guess maybe thats how it was with soldiers getting wounded or killed too. I never could figure out who was who. Enough of that. As for the end of the movie I think it could have ended a little different, maybe show the men coming home and the readjustments they had to make after going through hell. The movie just ended like this review...........
B004498KPU|3.0|It's nice to have a complete video collection (though, as some have pointed out, it isn't actually \\"complete\\"), but the mastering is sub par.  The image on especially the early videos is horrible--worse than VHS.  Sony also did not spring for anything in the way of anamorphic encoding, which I am of a split mind about.  Yes they preserve the original aspect ration, which in and of itself can be a good thing, but now there's black bars on either side of my widescreen TV.  The videos themselves are excellent of course--and if you're thinking about buying this then that's probably not a concern for you because you know what you're getting in terms of what the videos are like.  But the image and sound are not great--it would have been nice if Sony had decided to not rush this and spent some more time doing a quality re-master of the videos.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Queen Is Dead was the fourth album released by Manchester band, The Smiths, and is believed by many to be the best thing that this incredibly influential band ever recorded. The Smiths have a trademark sound of Jonny Marr's ability to write wonderfully catchy pop songs, while Morrissey sings his typically cynically mournful, but yet humourous lyrics, in a manner that showcases his wit and intelligence. The Smiths remain one of the largest inspirations for many indie bands today.<br /><br />If you are at all familiar with the music of The Smiths, you will know that Morrissey's lyrics are part of the same group as those of the likes of Thom Yorke and Roger Waters; looking at everyday life with often cynical humor, creating music that many people consider depressing. As with the bands that those 2 men front, The Smiths have their very own guitar maestro in Jonny Marr, who, while not technically brilliant, really can write a killer pop song, that goes brilliantly with Morrissey's lyrics. Often underrated is the rhythm section of the band, which provides a very good base for all the songs. Overall, I consider this album to be a classic of the genre, and one that, even if you have never heard The Smiths, but like Indie music, is an absolute must to check out.
1416594787|3.0|This is not the best book Dawkins has ever written. I thought The God Delusion had more passion, more verve and was better written than this offering. I really didn't like how Dawkins seems to want to cede ground and reinvent the definition of \\"theory\\" right up front. This makes no sense to me. Nothing Dawkins or any evolutionist does will ever make the fact of evolution any more palatable to history and science deniers. So why bother trying to do it by redefining the term \\"theory\\" -- just because these same history deniers are too ignorant to actually understand what the term means?<br /><br />Forget that.<br /><br />Anyway, Dawkins has all the usual stuff we come to expect from him: a passionate defense of evolution. But, sadly, it's written in a style that will not be easily accessible to ordinary readers. I think anyone who is already a fan of Dawkins (and I am) will probably enjoy this book. But for people who do not have at least a passing grounding in science I think the book may well be over their heads in many respects.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I think hat Rick Riordan NAILED the creation of this book just like all of the other installmets in the series. This book was action packed like no other book that I have ever read!  I can't wait until the next book in the series comes out! I hope to be one of the first to read the next book. Maybe ill be the first to blog about it ! Until then, TaTa!
0684833395|3.0|I don't presume to add much to the varied and detailed reviews of the book, except perhaps for an observation on how a popular work esteemed by one generation simply may not transcend its own time.<br />Like many, I first read Catch-22 many years ago in high school. I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the \\"counter-culture\\" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism.  War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as \\"absurd,\\" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.<br />I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the \\"syndicate\\" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin.  Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.<br />All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary.  Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step.  More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before.  Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and  70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation.  Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc.  It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.<br />I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it).  I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking.  And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.<br />In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many \\"popular\\" or \\"political\\" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was.  On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site.  That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire.realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was.

1608870081|4.0|This is a really fun book and is as detailed as the Harry Potter films themselves. Pop-ups are extremely hard to do (their alternate name is 'paper engineering which gives some idea of the difficulties) and these are particularly involved with many smaller pop-ups in the make-up of the larger and more complex double page spreads.  Where the book sometimes misses is that it uses photos from the films and in some cases these, when cut out and reduced, are occasionally blurry in detail and thus ineffective.However the major spreads such as Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest with Hagred's hut are very fine. If you are a Potter fan you will love this.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This is the perfect case for my iPod Nano (5th Gen). It fits my Nano perfectly, provides great protection and it's super easy to get my iPod into and out of. I don't use the armband, but I do use the clip. I mostly use my iPod at the gym and the clip is large and sturdy. My previous case was made of some sort of synthetic cloth with a very thin clear plastic sheet to protect the screen. After a few months it started to get kind of grungy and dirty looking and no matter what I did I couldn't get it to look clean. The clear hard plastic of the Griffin case is very easy to clean. I highly recommend!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is one of the most well written videogames I have every had the pleasure of playing.     Pros:     +Absolutely breathtaking story and script   +Puzzles are fun and typically clover and intuitive   +Multiple endings depending on choices   +Did I mention the dialogue sequences are so well written that you will enjoy reading as much as playing the puzzles?   +Beautiful art style   +Sound and Music are perfectly fitting, never overwhelming and always added to the experience     Cons:     -In order to get every ending you have replay the game and so you have to replay puzzles over and over again to obtain the endings   -No options to speed up text for faster readers (except upon second play throughs in which you can fast forward scenes you have already seen)
B0045MRQS8|5.0|Well what can you say about Unruly Child?  Probably responsible for THE best melodic rock album debut way back in 1992 - they are now back!!  The original line-up split after the debut and although they did release two more albums the return of their original singer has caused the most interest.  Mark Free is now known as Marcie Michelle Free - yep - he HAS had a sex-change - but oh boy her? voice still sounds as good as it did on that debut album all those years ago.....  This album is full of perfectly crafted, well written melodic rock.  All 12 songs are strong - Love is Blind has a very Bon Jovi feel, the title track is powerful and the whole album seems to have been very well produced.  As Classic Rock say - if you only buy one melodic rock album this year make sure this is the one!!!!
B0029LHW4U|2.0|The thing about AIC was you would always recognize the group from the vocals of Layne.  I don't know much about the new singer but it seems like an attempt to imitate Layne and not by someone who can adequately imitate Layne's vocals.  I have heard no name AIC cover bands do a better job than this guy , so why did they not just go a different direction with the band or even start a new band with the new singer?  Not sure but it would have done them more justice musically to evolve or start something new.  The new singer is talented and can sing but not in the way \\"love them or hate them\\" that made the distinct sound and feel of AIC what it was.  This album sounds like a watered down version of Cantrell's solo stuff which was AIC without Layne and honestly a good chunk of the exposure and actual airplay this album is getting is because of the name of the band and not the product.  Cantrell's solo stuff never got much love from MTV or FM radio so honestly I am not sure of the motivation of this new incarnation of AIC.  Thing is you can be popular but not be radio or MTV friendly but when achieving the amount of fame , exposure , and money that was earned by this band in the 90's it's tough to let those perks (financially , fame , and other stuff) go and not want them again.  While I enjoy Cantrell's solo work this in my opinion is a likely cash grab due to the fact that his solo career did not live up to the expectations Jerry had for it.  But back to this album it is slightly better than the average FM hard rock that is over played every day and for that it gets two stars.  But this is not AIC except for some watered down typical guitar work you would had heard on the various other AIC albums.  This band was very good musically all around even though I prefer Mike Starr on bass in the old days compared to Mike Inez , but the mood , angst , and emotion was created by Layne and his ability to work so well with Cantrell's song writing and vocals.  They complemented eachother so well vocally and it was beautiful in an odd and dark way.  Long time AIC fans know all the albums but if you are looking to get into this band for what they actually stood for and made them the success they were opt for \\"SAP\\" or \\"Jar of Flies\\" and if you want the more metal side of this band go for \\"Facelift\\" then I would recommend \\"Dirt\\" after that , but this is not AIC and they should out of respect for the previous lineup and themselves change the name!

B004132I4S|5.0|It's hard to write a decent review for one of the most shining, innovative albums of the year. That being said, I've been tentatively been putting this review on the back burner. Before I begin, I have to tell you I wasn't much of a Sufjan fan before. His voice was soft spoken and songs felt a little too childish and unrelatable for my alternative rock tastes. But Sufjan's new album, entitled \\"Age of Adz,\\" blew my preconceived notions out of the water and left me gasping on the beach. Not only has Sufjan reinvented his song writing, he has managed to do so with utter  ingenuity  and brilliance. I've heard comparisons to Radiohead's \\"Kid A,\\" but it's more of a step-brother to \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" albeit better. Many of Age of Adz mirrors paintings of a schizophrenic artist and his own battle with a immune disease.     The intro Futile Devices is more of a farewell to elegance of the past. \\"Too Much\\" sets the mood right, to the seemingly eclectic and bizarreness of the album. Age of Adz seems like a brilliant summary from the album as a whole,  beginning like a monstrous nightmare at a circus, to beautiful guitar strings at the end. \\"I Walked\\" is probably the black sheep of all the songs, repetitive and mundane.  What is most notable about Sufjan's singing and his lyrics is that they are the most poignantly honest and emotional in his career. Songs like \\"Now That I'm Older,\\" laments past mistakes and \\"All for Myself\\" is starkly introspective. \\"Vesuvius\\" explores the darkest crevices of human nature and Sufjan's increasing desperation. And my favorite song, \\"I Want To Be Well\\" pushes the listener to borderline insanity-- sweet, insane, pandemonium of a mind that isn't \\"f-ing around.\\" And who can forget the 25 minute song that is a bit self-indulging, but worth an admirable ending.      Somehow Sufjan has able to craft an ingeniously dark, hopeful, deep, and intimately album that demands careful and repetitive listening. The album sure isn't easy listening, nor \\"radio friendly,\\" but like a fine wine it'll require aging. You'll be hooked.
B000BC8STM|5.0|You could not ask for a better performance by anyone. This woman has done everything fantastic in her career and just continues to improve with age. If you enjoy this DVD try checking out her \\"Farewell Tour\\" which is just as good if not better than the previous DVD. I plan on going to see her soon as she performs in Las Vegas on a regular basis. Lets hear it for the top DIVA around. Nice Job all the way around!!
B00013AXEE|5.0|I'd always been somewhat apathetic toward Stephen King's work until I read this book.  I've read it about five times now (I've had it for a few years) and never get tired of reading the parts that speak the most to me.  Most of the time, I skip the first part (I've already read it a few times, and these days when I pick up 'On Writing' it is for writing inspiration, not joy-reading) and get straight to the meat of the book.      This book makes you want to write.  It gives you permission to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard, most likely) and get lost in a world all your own.  When I want to write, but can't find the motivation to get started, I can pick up this book, read a few pages (and usually get sucked into reading the entire second part) and I'm ready to write.      The other reviews have belabored the contents of the book (some to the point I wonder why anyone reading it would bother buying the book), so I'm not writing this review for content.  I'm writing this review for the other readers/writers out there who like to have something on their shelves that they can pick up and read for a little kick in the pants to get started.      This isn't so much a 'How To' but rather a 'Can Do' book, when you need to be reminded why you're pounding the keys.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A wonderful, thought-provoking book. I for one have always wondered if maybe modern religion has gotten it wrong in order to control the blind masses, and this book evokes the very same questions. Kudos to Dan Brown for another spellbinding masterpiece!!!
B004EJ14V2|5.0|I've been out of HS for some time, and things and technology have changed...but people haven't as this movie does a fun job of pointing out.
B00447G2T8|5.0|being a helloween fan, i am always excited to hear of a new helloween release. there's nothing better than getting a new release from your favorite band and kicking down the walls with some new metal.  then comes 7 SINNERS.......and it blew my mind. this is BY FAR one of the top 3 helloween releases of all time. this band just keeps getting better and better! i really thought it would be hard for them to top 'gambling with the devil' which is, on its own a fantastic album,(and one of my favs) but, they blew it out of the water. this album shreds on every level of metaldom. it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go at any time.  now i'll admit that i was a little apprehensive after the 'unarmed' release and, getting an advance look at some of the song titles for sinners didn't help much. at first glance, titles like 'the smile of the sun', 'you stupid mankind', 'if a mountain could talk', didn't exactly get the metal juices flowing. actually they sound downright silly. but when you listen to the album, you dont even notice it. the lyrics and song titles fit together so seemlessly that any prior notion of sillyness is immediately dismissed. every song on this album is a keeper and will kick you square in the jaw with how heavy and rythmic they are. the guitar riffs on this album are incredible, while the beats and drumming make you wanna bang your head and go nuts. the writing is impeccable with every band member writing more than one track. the exception being drummer dani loble, who doesn't get any songwriting credit on this one. but once you hear his drumming on this album, that more than makes up for any lack of songwriting credits. he simply destroys all on this one.  my fav tracks on this one are 'long live the king', 'raise the noise', 'who is mr. madman', 'world of fantasy'......hell they're ALL my favorite!! that's how good this album is. and first single 'are you metal' is THE metal anthem of all time. there are a lot of 'i love metal' songs out there byvarious bands but this one tops em all.  my only complaint about this album is that the lyrics and such were not included in the booklet. and while i do enjoy the SAW-esqe pictures in there, thats all there is. no lyrics, which i dont think the band has ever done with any of their previous albums. so really thats the only downside of this album.  it's good to see the fire in their bellies on this album and truly cannot wait for the next album after this one.  ARE YOU METAL? indeed you are!!!  so if you're looking for a solid slab of fist pumping, head banging, hard charging, metal bliss, then buy this album and RAISE THE NOISE!
B00192IV9U|5.0|I received this album today and listened to it tonight. All I can say is that this is a great album and all the songs in it are like easy type listening music.  I have all of MJs records and most of his DVDs.  This one completes most of my collection of MJs albums.  He has a voice that is very unique, one-of-kind. And I like all the songs in this album.  They are all good to listen to.  There are some you feel like dancing to, and some that makes you relax.  I felt a little sadness though as I listened to this one because I missed Michael.  I believed he was a good man and helped a lot of disadvantaged children during his lifetime.  I'm glad I bought this one because it sure is worth the price.
B00006LSHO|3.0|I havd never ordered a DVD on line and was not aware of what a \\"Region  2\\" item was. Now I am stuck with this DVD and Ican not even watch it.
032147404X|5.0|I think this is the perfect book to carry in your camera bag. Just the guide I need when out on a shoot and what to add a artistic edge to my pictures.  My photography has definitely improved since getting this book.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|This is a great CD.  I highly recommend it to Pink Martini fans and anyone else who enjoys fine music.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Awesome movie, my husband & I were both very impressed. Never got slow, great acting, very believable. Can't wait to see the additional footage.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I will be honest,I am 30 and I never heard of this band before last week. I thought that the cover looked interesting so I bought it. The songs were pretty good. I look forward to buying more of this bands records and if I am lucky, maybe I can see them in concert someday.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie before it came out, thinking Disney had little originality or beauty left to share, but I was quite mistaken. This movie was enchanting in every way from start to finish. It is without a doubt top shelf material (surprisingly, Tangled was also a great movie).    People complain alot about the voodoo in Princess and the Frog. I don't quite get the problem. Most Disney villans use black magic of some sort so why should this one be a problem when all the others aren't? And even the films with villians who don't use magic... why should any sort of abuse be ok, whether it's based in magic or not? In real life it's not ok, but in a movie it's the foundation for the bad guys so it gives the movie plot, drama and something to grow from.     Too scary for kids? Some youger kids will be scared, but some won't. We took our daughter to see the movie in theaters for her 3rd birthday. She didn't have a problem with it and was enthralled throughout the movie. You should know if your child gets scared easily or not. And even if they are too young now, they will grow up.    This movie was fantastic. I like to think that our culture is progressive and mature, but I'm dissappointed to see how scared many of us actually are. In my opinion, this film is not to be missed. It's one of Disney's best!!
0061997811|5.0|Harry Potter Film Wizardry by Brian Sibley is all about the magic of the Harry Potter films. Find out why the ice sculptures at the Yule Ball didn't melt, the secret behind the floating candles in the Great Hall and much more with this behind the scenes look of the films.<br /><br />Harry Potter Film Wizardry by Brian Sibley is the most visually stunning book I have seen for the Harry Potter films. If you like the books, the movies, and the actors that portray the characters, you will want to check this book out right away. Warning: once you start looking at it and reading it, you won't want to put it down!<br /><br />My not so little secret is that I love the Harry Potter books and films. The series is one of my favorite book/movie series of all time. I have to admit that even I didn't know much of what was written in this book though. All of the secrets behind the movies are really quite interesting. For instance, did you know Hermione was cast before Ron and Harry?<br /><br />This magical book is setup to look like a scrapbook put together like how we all wish we could do ourselves. I absolutely loved all of the pull-out sections especially Harry Potter's acceptance letter to Hogwarts, a map of Diagon Alley, Advanced Potion Making stickers to add to bottles of your own, the 422nd Quidditch World Cup Programme, and the Marauder's Map.<br /><br />Harry Potter Film Wizardry is the perfect gift for a fan of the Harry Potter movies and/or books. This is the kind of book that makes those E-books cry because it has the touches that an electronic version could never achieve. Seriously, this is a book that would be treasured and enjoyed each time it is read. All of the special touches make it feel like you have a true treasure pulled right out of the Gringott's bank vault.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of Harry Potter Film Wizardry, Collins Design, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
0782002064|5.0|I finally have my own original copy.  I feel everyone should have this movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" in their library.  Certainly make you see what's the important thing in life.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I really enjoyed this one and so did my husband. Yes it's cute and funny but it also has a decent message. If you don't want to buy it, you should at least rent it. Your kids will definitely love it!
1934356476|5.0|This is a gem (no pun intended) among Ruby books and, in fact, among programming books in general.  What sets this book apart from other programming books is its focus on having the reader deeply understand the ruby programming model whether you are a novice or an expert.  This is an achievement few other programming books can claim.  While meta-programming in ruby is certainly a pleasure when compared to other oo languages, it is still a rather arcane subject, and for this author to be able to explain it on a deep level to beginners is simply awe inspiring!  There is also plenty of material for the advanced rubyist including a chapter devoted to what I like to call \\"dynamic adaptive programming\\" but will be known more familiarly as \\"code that writes code\\".  But even the expert will want to read the whole text for its clear, almost zen-like treatment of meta-programming.  If I were to be a complete novice to ruby, instead of reading the basic texts like [[ASIN:1934356085 Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide (Facets of Ruby)]] and [[ASIN:0596516177 The Ruby Programming Language]]  (although the oreilly book should at some point be read thoroughly at some point), I would simply read this book and the following book in tandem:  [[ASIN:0321490452 Design Patterns in Ruby]].
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This a very nice, well constructed and well designed camera backpack.  I have a Pentax Kx with 3 lenses which all fit well.  Padding and configuration is well balanced.  This backpack is an excellent value.
0763644765|5.0|Great for little ones about to potty train or in the midst of potty training. Our son goes on the potty to pee, but not poo.  This book got him interested in trying again and I think really helped pushed him to continue to try!  He loves the book, especially the part where the baby is dancing in his diaper and has to go.  No matter how many times we read it, he laughs.  A terrific purchase.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love this movie. May favorite so far...the engagment scence??? all i can saw is sawoooon! The New borns were actually un-nerving with the way they came out the water...Cant wait for breaking dawn!
B001NTFQRY|5.0|Do you like Blade Runner? how about Vangelis? Well if you do this is a must buy, even if like me, you own all of the previous releases.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|This book, in my opinion, is one of Richard Dawkins' best works. He presents many fascinating theories and ideas, backed up by incontrovertible scientific evidence. Hopefully, at least a few of the embarrassing 40% of Americans, who believe in literal Creation and that the age of the earth is less than 10,000 years can read this book with an open mind.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I viewed this movie just once, on DVD format.  My next venture into the re-invented Batman genre by Christopher Nolan would be on blu-ray, and it was just spectacular.  The detailed clarity of this film is what the blu-ray format was intended to display, at its visual apex.  The soundtrack is equally engaging, and is appropriately married to the picture quality.      A great bonus is how the movie shifts from Widescreen to Imax imaging, depending on the scene, shadowing the exact theatrical experience when you plop down your hard earned $$ for a movie show at actual theaters.  Bravo to the powers to be at Warner Bros. for duplicating this feature on blu-ray for the home theater audience.    It is very obvious that Heath Ledger stole the show on this particular movie, nothing taken away from Christian Bale's performance.  Ledger's performance as the Joker, escalates Batman's nemesis to a level never explored, short of the masterful display done by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's rendition of the series.  Ledger's portrayal exudes an evil that is not only physical, but psychologically tormenting, frightful & unpredictable.  As an audience, you realize that the Batman is in for the fight of his illustrious career against the likes of THIS Joker.    Ever since Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale were hired to continue the franchise, their work as director and principal actor has reinvigorated the series with a realism and grittiness that truly defines the Black Knight.  After Michael Keaton's two performances as the winged avenger, the series just morphed into sheer silliness and drowned in its own bloated pulp comic representation.    The Dark Knight is definitely one of the best, if not the best, in featuring the Batman film series.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card arrived in timely fashion, and worked perfectly. The card looked brand-new and was worth the 2 dollars I paid for it. I intend to buy a couple more by the way.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is an all time classic Christmas comedy. Everyone can relate to this dysfunctual family on some level. This is by far the best Chevy Chase movie. It has all the workings of a perfect comedy. \\"The perfect Christmas!\\" Hah! The crazy and not smart brother in law, The Grandparents! The crazy Aunt & Uncle, the uptight neighbors, selfish boss, and delusional man who thinks he can make a perfect Christmas. I mean come on, how do you staple yourself to the house? LOL! 100 extention cords plugged into the same wall socket. We watch this movie EVERY Thanksgiving after dinner. It is our family tradition & always will be...oh yeh, lets not forget about Clark in the attic. Merry Christmas!
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I received this movie very quickly, and it works like new.  It came in a weird \\"special edition\\" acrylic case, which is fine, but it was not like the traditional DVD case pictured.  Also, it advertised that it included a Digital Copy, but when I received it the paper inside with the digital copy code said that the offered had expired several months before I purchased it.  Not a huge deal, but I was kinda looking forward to being able to watch this on the go. But the DVD works great, and that's what I really wanted, so I give this transaction 4 stars.
B000022TSY|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film has virtually no story just some guys ride motorcycles and then get shot. If you like movies with completley irrelavent scenes that are inconsequential, this a movie for you.
0312323867|5.0|Emily Giffin is a wonderful writer for those who love to read, but don't always have a lot of time for it. I read her books and hate to put them down.   I really enjoyed the other perspective after reading SoBo. I totally sided with Rachel and couldn't stand Darcy in the first book and after reading SoBlue was able to relate to Darcy and really enjoy the character. This was definitely a great compliment to SoBo.
0316098337|5.0|I initially chose this book simply because it has been on many \\"best books of 2010\\" lists - I just had to see what the buzz was all about!  And I am SO glad I did - this isn't just one of the best books of the year, it's one of the best books I've EVER read.  I highly recommend it with one caveat - set aside a whole day to just read it.  It's such a page turner that you're going to want to!  I read all 300+ pages in two days - the first night I was up until midnight because I just could NOT put it down!      So what makes it so great?  First and foremost would be that the story is told from the perspective of a five year old boy, Jack, which gives the narrative a very unique voice.  Then there's the haunting story line, perfect pacing, the perfectly-developed characters, and a gripping plot.  Do not pass up this book!
B000002JB8|3.0|Oceanic being Vangelis 1996 release and is an Electronica influenced album. Allmusic gave it 1.5/5 which I think is way low. It is not one of Vangelis stronger releases. However, I think it is an alright album and I give it 3/5. The booklet contains artistic photos of synchronized swimmers. 3/5.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|unfortunately, this book requires you to have an elementary knowledge of physics/quantum physics. honestly, i'm a college student and still have a hard time understanding te science...it still needs to simplify more of the concepts discussed.
0385737955|5.0|This book is simple amazing. James dashner is one of my favorite authors. This book is good, keeping you at the edge of your set. With excitment and mystery. I'm working on reading the second one right now and its simply Breathe-taking!
B0041YI4ZO|1.0|These days, when you buy a DVD, you really expect it to be good quality. Otherwise you might as well just download the movie. This DVD doesn't meet this standard. It is a high-compression DVD-5 (low picture quality with lots of compression). There is no dts track. No special features of any kind. The cover art looks blurry (bootleg???). I don't know, but $11 shipped for this seems like a ripoff. Oh, and the flimsy plastic case was broken when I got it. Disappointing.
0525423273|5.0|This book should have a warning label: Do not read if you have to care for small children (particularly sick ones).  Because interruptions were NOT welcome!  Once I started this book I felt like I walked around in a daze.  I had two sick kids and it was torture every time I had to put this book down!  Seriously!  If I had started it at night I would have been up all night.  It was just so freaking good!<br />Okay, so I'm going to start with Anna.  I liked her.  I liked that she had faults, or things she thought were faults anyway.  I loved that she was a bit terrified to go out on her own and was afraid to even make her own food order because she didn't know French.  That was completely me!  I would've suffered and just ate bread so I wouldn't embarrass myself either!  I understood her.  How she had to keep distracted with thinking she had a crush on others and how she dealt with things.  That was how she and St. Clair became such amazing friends and if she had done things differently- well things would have turned out differently.  I genuinely liked her and she didn't drive me nuts at all.<br />St. Clair... oh yummy goodness... seriously.  Accent, personality, looks... he has it all!  I couldn't help but swoon in about every scene with him.  And although he's hot and has an amazing accent with all those cute Briticism's that us Americans adore so, it was his personality that made him so freaking adorable!  And even with all that he had faults.  Not many, but he was short which some might see as a downside, and he had fears and issues to deal with.  The little things made him more real.<br />The side characters in this book were all important.  They shaped the story and took it in the different directions it took.  All of them were interesting and had personalities you could understand and relate to.<br />Now one thing I really loved was that this took place in Paris.  And we got to see it through Anna's eyes.  An American.  And it was so beautiful, and romantic and really, just an amazing place.  I can't wait to go someday!  And when I'll go I'll probably be thinking of Anna and St. Clair.  I can just see myself exclaiming \\"this is where they made their wishes!\\"  or \\"This is just like the cafe that Anna talked about!\\".  Yep, can't wait!<br />And I can't forget to mention the sexual tension.  I've found lately that this is one of my favorite things in YA.  I like the tension, A LOT.  And this book, well, it had it.  Definitely had it!  So much so that when stuff happens you about fall out of your chair in excitement.  I actually cried toward the end of the book because it was so perfect.  Beyond perfect.<br />This book isn't one of those love at first sight books.  Yeah, there's attraction, but this book is about two people who become amazing friends and later it develops into more.  It's much more real then two people who see each other, give each other smoldering looks and know they are in love without ever really getting to know each other.<br />There is one thing in this book that I have to mention, mostly for those who have already read it, but when Anna realizes what exactly 'home' is- well, that just felt right and it made the entire story so much better.  If that's even possible, because this book is a Once in a Blue Moon book, above 5 stars.  It's definitely one of my favorites of the year!an amazing place.  I can't wait to go someday!

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Daft Punk did an AMAZING job with the score. I bought the soundtrack the day after I saw Tron. It was too good not to get it. I've never bought a soundtrack before, aside from this. But the score fits so well with the Tron universe. I didn't know that Daft Punk was originally inspired by the first Tron movie, I thought that was really neat.    Standout tracks for me are: The Son of Flynn, Rinzler, Derezzed, C.L.U., & Flynn Lives    I loved the movie. I thought everything about it was great, I'm a fan of the original though. :D
0375701427|4.0|Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize Winning novel uniquely chronicles the downfall of the great American family of the 50's and the cataclysmic cultural transformation of the 60's generation as they forcefully broke away from their parents' values.      The novel tells the story of \\"Swede\\" Levov through the eyes of Nathan Zuckerman, Roth's frequent narrator and someone who worshipped Swede as a child.  Swede has it all on the outside.  He grew up a high school legend in Newark, an athlete who excelled at everything he did, a tall attractive blond who stuck out in the Jewish neighborhood he grew up in.        After graduation, Swede joins the Marines, hopeful to get in on the action in WWII, but enlists just as the war ends.  He then goes to a small NJ college to play baseball, and is good enough to play in the Major Leagues.  However, he sacrifices that career to work for his father, who owns a glove-making business.  (A metaphor of the cultural changes to come as gloves transform from a daily garment to a niche product.)  As a consolation prize however, he ends up with a beautiful wife--Miss New Jersey 1949, in fact--and a wonderful young daughter named Merry, whose only flaw seems to be a stutter.       The fabric begins to unravel however when Merry begins to have anger issues.  She lashes out at her parents about Vietnam and the comfortable lives they lead.  Eventually she becomes uncontrollable, spending weekends in NYC despite her father's weak protests.  Finally a bomb is set off in their small-town post office, killing one person.  Merry disappears, so is immediately implicated.  From there we follow Swede over the next five years as his family and the idyllic life he had always dreamed of falls apart.        What struck me about reading this novel was that I felt I had no idea what would happen next, not just from a perspective of plot, but also form.  There's a feeling of suspense even though there aren't many true scenes--much time is spent in Swede's turbulentmind.  But from Swede's disturbing meeting with Rita Cohen to the final dinner scene, I was amazed at where Roth took me; he was masterful in his scene selection.      I agree with other reviews that have complained about the book dragging in parts.  This happens mostly when we're inside Swede's head, which becomes more bogged down with thoughts as the story progresses, and at the glove factory, where the manufacture of the gloves and the business is lovingly reflected in all its fine detail.  Yes, there were times I just wanted Roth to move on.      Still, I think most thoughtful readers will see what he was trying to do, and that is to write a deep and intelligent chronicle of one of the most crushing cultural disturbances in the last century through the eyes of a man who had the most to lose from it.  From the use of Zuckerman to tell of his boyhood idol's downfall, to the climactic dinner party, where Watergate, Deep Throat, infidelity, alcoholism, and religion all make appearances, Roth approaches the subject in a unique and gifted way.  This is book is definitely worth the acclaim.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I used to use the headset that came with battlefield 2, but it was really uncomfortable after extended use. Then I was looking around for a new headset, and found these at frys electronics for around 30 bucks.  They're comfortable even after wearing them for 10+hours (Trust me, I've tried. lol raiding and heroics take time. :P)  And they have great sound quality, plus a good quality mic. In Vent everyone hears me clearly, and I hear them. :D  And if I'm just using them for listening to music or something while I play, they have really good bass and sound quality then too.   Also the volume and mic control on the wire make it easy to use as well.  In addition, I've had them for about two years and haven't had any problems. The wire is nice and thick so it doesn't break. They have a nice sturdy design, and it won't break from normal use like others might.   So if you're looking for a good headset for those long raids or whatever else you play, I'd reccomend these. Affordable, durable, comfortable after hours of use, and great quality all around.

Doesn't say much for the foresight of the average Hollywood corporate knuckle dragger.<br />The writing is tight, coherent, and very humorous. The casting is perfect. You cannot go wrong with this purchase, and buying from Amazon is always a pleasure. rk

B004BSEKH6|5.0|This is actually a really good album. Of course there will be people to bash it and say it isn't that great.  I was not a Nikki Minaj fan but this is a really good album.  I like Moment for Life it is one of the songs I listen to every day.  If you take the time to truly listen to the words in her songs you will see she is talented and you can relate to her songs.. Right Thru Me is a good example of this because if you ever had that one person who knew you so well and no matter what has been there with you good and bad..you will feel this song.  I have someone I think about everytime I hear it because we are like two peas in a pod and it is rare to find someone who is your equal. Anyway this album was worth the wait alot better than some of her other music that was released...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Male - 48 - Read it because a fem co-worker suggested it.    This was a great read...took a little bit to get used to her writing style but the story line is incredibly good. In the hands of a JK Rowling or Stephenie Meyer this would have been an unimaginable journey!! That's not to berate the author, but rather to tell you that this \\"story\\" is simply excellent but perhaps not fleshed out to its fullest. Now, to contradict myself, let me say that you'll leave this story feeling like you left some great friends behind. She does a great job making the reader love who you should and hate those who deserve it! I mean really...how can you not love Rue?? Over all I loved this book...loved it.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I will give this movie 3 stars automatically for it's stellar cast, the cutting edge special effects,   and the amazing action sequences which keep it moving and definitely makes this movie not a bore at all!  But I've watched it twice now, and though I know it has to to with dreams, the subconscious mind,   what is reality and what isn't....I have to admit that I still don't fully get it!  Can somebody please explain it to me?--At your leisure, in the comments section.    I'm not too proud to admit that the concept and script of this film were a bit over my head.  But in no way do I think this was a bad movie at all!---It definitely engages you on many levels.  Maybe if I had understood it fully, I could've given it 5 stars.
1934030554|5.0|Excellent book, all I need to train with my PM is that book. Superb scientific but easy to read. SUPER!!!
0061537969|5.0|If any one of the following apply you will like the book. If two apply you will love the book. Add the third, and you absolutely must not miss this superb and unusual piece of writing:    1) Do you love, or have you ever loved a dog?    2) Did you follow or have an interest in Road Racing, particularly Formula !, in the sixties through the nineties?  3) Has anyone ever intentionally lied about you to others, perhaps in a very personal matter, in order to get something they wanted?    In this touching story told from the perspective of what amounts to an intelligent, perceptive, sensitive human spirit trapped speechless in the body of an aging and devoted pet, will be found a range of emotions coming from experiencing some of the most trying and triumphant moments a human being can experience.    I had my doubts when I first started reading, but by the end I was looking for friends to call who had one or more of the three \\"Qualifications\\" above and to whom I could send copies to as Christmas gifts.
0739384198|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this third book in the trilogy!  I am saddened that we have lost the creative mind that brought Salander and Blomkvist to the page, but the trilogy (and especially the third segment) is a true legacy for author Stieg Larsson.
B00000FBRE|3.0|It's a good CD, but I received Let's Talk about Leftovers instead of the listed album.  Not too mention the CD case was broke in two different places.  I figured not to make an attempt to fix it since it would be too much of a hazzle.  Either way I'm a Lag Wagon fan and still liked the purchase.
B0036WC890|3.0|The writing in this book was decent, and I was enthralled for the first half of the book.  After this, the book is very much like other ecology and environmental books, except not as interesting and not as informative, in my opinion.  The first half of the book is so much better than the second half that I find it unbelievable.  On this basis, I would have given the book 4 stars, but, since reading it, I found that Diamond misleads his readers in the first half.  Since reading this book, I have found multiple sources that talk about how contentious some topics are, such as the demise of Easter Island.  Had he mentioned this in the book, I would have been happy, but he didn't, and I hate being misinformed.  Diamond writes about a number societies and how they collapsed, but presents his opinions as though there are no real alternatives, or as though they are not hotly contested.  I like that he said things like \\"my thought is,\\" but he doesn't present the reader with other possibilities, and it gave me the feeling that there were no other good ideas out there.  Had he simply stated that others have different ideas about such and such, I would have been fine with that.<br /><br />While I have found a number of things wrong with the book, I would still suggest it to someone who has not read anything on the topic of the collapse of societies.  I think it is important that everyone gives some amount of consideration to the importance of the human impact upon our habitat.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Diamond has an axe to grind for sure, but I will leave it to others to decide for theirself.
030726999X|4.0|I loved the parts that were the actual story. Stieg kind of got long-winded during some of his explanations; I knew he could be that way from the 1st and 2nd novels, but it seemed more pronounced in this one. When he was explaining the Section and the SIS, it went on forever. He also repeated himself. He felt the need to explain Salander and Zalachenko's situations more than once. I ended up skipping some sections because some policeman or SIS officer was explaining it to yet another policeman or SIS officer and by this time I knew the story backwards and forwards.<br /><br />But the parts where things were actually happening, I really enjoyed. Ever since the beginning I have loved Lisbeth and her eccentricities. And it was great how Mikael got everyone to rally around her cause and not just assume that she's guilty. I enjoyed the side stories, too, with Berger's stalker and the search for Neidermann. Once events really started going, it was hard for me to put the book down and do my Christmas shopping...
B003TXKSWK|2.0|Not what we thought the CD was going to be like. We have other John Legend CD's this is like the others....to much rap for our liking.
B003Q6D27S|1.0|Honestly, this had to be the worst movie in the Saw franchise. The ending is predictable, and instead of answering any of our questions gathered throughout the series, they pile up more and refuse to answer any of them. Not only that, but the actors got worse. They added new ones who were completely terrible that I thought I was watching a parody or a sixth grade reenactment. The graphics, \\"3D\\", and gore was cheesy and boring, and the sold called anticipated \\"most horrible trap in the Saw franchise ever\\" was a complete joke compared to the rest in the series.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|This latest Kanye West album is various levels of amazing, from the creativity to the grandeur of the production to the variety of the songs. The man's a genius, and to try to deny it is a waste of time. You may not like his antics -- and antics can take attention away from good music; just ask Michael Jackson -- but his music is superior to anyone else's out there.    The beauty of this album is that certain songs sound like they would fit perfectly on other Kanye albums. For example, \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" could be on The College Dropout and \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Blame Game\\" would have fit on 808s and Heartbreak. If I have one gripe about the album, it's that Kanye is clearly going for pop as much as rap, and very few songs on this album are truly about the rap verses; rather, they're about the production. But the production is so good that it doesn't really matter.    My two favorite songs are \\"So Appalled,\\" which I was familiar with from G.O.O.D. Fridays; and \\"Dark Fantasy,\\" which has a chorus that sounds like it's from a modern Broadway musical. However, on this song, the beat that Kanye raps over is so incredibly awesome that I can't help but wish there was more of it, instead of two verses. \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" is a great, more soulful song. The album version of \\"Runaway\\" is better than the single version. The only song that I could do without is \\"Blame Game,\\" but the Chris Rock part at the end helps to make up for it.    I don't think this is better than \\"Late Registration,\\" which is my favorite rap album in recent memory. But it's a close second on Kanye's remarkable discography. I wish it was a little more of a rap album, but it's awfully good.
0307408833|5.0|I'm not sure why anyone would find this cookbook hard to follow.  It's very straightforward.  Yes, it's not completely gluten-free, but for me, someone who is allergic to yeast, milk, eggs, and nuts, it was a GREAT book. A LIFECHANGER, because now I can bake again.  The only thing I can see being a little more difficult is finding the ingredients.  That being said, you can buy them on Amazon.com, or at any Whole Foods Market, which are popping up everywhere.<br /><br />It's also a lot less guilt-inducing making these easily adapted recipes.  They're so much healthier.  So it's not all gluten-free.  In some recipes she wants you to use spelt.  One solution I came up with was to substitute the Spelt for the gluten-free flour instead.  It won't turn out quite the same, but close enough. I substitute the rice milk for almond milk because it's the 1 nut I'm not allergic to and I like adding protein where I can.  Even the coconut oil, which adds intense flavor, can be substituted for olive oil, etc.  I also like substituting the cane sugar for Stevia or Xylitol to reduce calories.<br /><br />So far, my husband and my personal training clients all LOVE the cookies I made.  I also made blueberry muffins and scones we could not stop eating.  The worst thing about this book is trying not to gain 5 lbs making all the delicious recipes.  Tonight I plan on making the Lemon Poppy Bread!  I can't wait!<br /><br />Seriously, it's a good book.  I have no complaints.
0345477618|5.0|Star Wars is perhaps the best movie of all time, for many different reasons. This book only made me appreciate the movie more. It's also somewhat of a psychological analysis of the cast and crew behind the film--especially George Lucas. You can see, in many ways, the underpinnings of the disaster known as the final three films.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the rest of the series (when is RotJ coming out??).
B003Q6D25K|5.0|I am very disappointed at how people looked down at this movie and reviewed it so poorly. The movie is a psychological thriller, not some cheap form of entertainment that we're all use to and expect. What makes this movie remarkable is how well it ties in with the original, and accompanies it perfectly, tying up loose ends, giving us more questions, and keeping us in suspense. Do not watch this movie expecting to be shocked, scared, or thrilled. This movie should be noted for its realistic dialect and tone, of how an everyday family can be torn and shaken by forces they can't possibly go up against. People expect to see the villain, or for the villain to commit such heinous acts that it makes us sick and at the same time ecstatic. How boring is that? A movie should be original and experimental, the plot should be the main focus, not whats expected of it. Tod Williams did a great job tying this movie in with Oren Peli's original and anyone who says otherwise either doesn't know how to properly watch and analyze a film, was expecting some regurgitated material in which case I suggest you go see Friday the 13th or Halloween for the five millionth time, or was expecting something else instead of a suspenseful psychological horror.
0763637084|5.0|This is Charlie and Lola at their finest - a book that will make your children WANT to eat their vegetables.  It is very funny and a fantastically done pop-up.  We have our own copy and buy more for gifts.
0439023513|1.0|I will begin by saying I won't be spoiling the ending in this review, because I hate it when there are spoilers all over the internet. What I do want to say is that this is one of the worst endings to a series I have ever read. Could it be any more obvious that she had no idea how to end this series? It was like one day she sat down, and said \\"I'm done with this\\" then wrote an ending in 10 minutes. I couldn't believe what a massive let down that was.    Bad Suzanne Collins!
B003X2O6KW|3.0|I don't understand where the hoop-lah is coming from  this album is really overproduced; there is such a thing as too much and there is beauty in simplicity. Unfortunately this album rarely showcases the latter sentiment, furthering the frustration is the fact that if you heard the G.O.O.D. Friday tracks, you have heard all the actual good songs too.      Overall it is a decent album, but please don't buy into the praises, if one should do such disappointment is inevitable.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This movie reminded me of several great works of art (i.e. Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged - man vs machine, Joan of Arc and Frankenstein).  The music is similar to Danny Elfmans style.  The movie is a bit long at 2 hours and 4 minutes, but still great to watch. I think an excellent job was done in piecing together the story line. The erotic dance scene was a bit funny to watch. A must see for movie buffs. Ciao
B0002F6BRE|5.0|\\"Elf\\" grows more charming and endearing (and hopefully also enduring) every year. This film quickly replaced \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" as my favorite Christmas movie of all time. Will Ferrell's adolescent screen persona, so annoying in every other movie of his, is perfectly suited to the role of Buddy, an innocent 30 year old \\"elf-child\\" trapped in a man's body. The movie works, in large part, because Ferrell remains completely sincere, and his Christmas cheer is genuinely infectious. When a shocked Buddy learns he is actually a human who has been raised by Elves, he sets out on a mission to find his biological father. In the process, he also brings some old-fashioned North Pole magic to a world-weary New York City.<br />  Director Jon Favreau deftly keeps the movie  balanced and grounded, never allowing it to wallow in too much candy-cane sweetness. The supporting cast, featuring a perfectly exasperated James Caan (as Buddy's biological father Walter Hobbs, who is on Santa's \\"Naughty List\\"), a perfectly deadpan Bob Newhart (as Papa Elf), Mary Stenburgen (as Walter's bemused wife Emily),  Zooey Deschanell as Buddy's sweetheart Jovie (\\"I'm just trying to get through the holidays\\"), and Edward Asner as a crusty but kind-hearted Santa Claus, is wonderful. The script and dialogue are  smart and snappy. Buddy's remark to Art Lang as a department-store Santa Claus,-- \\"You sit on a throne of lies!\\"-- is priceless. \\"Elf\\" is all heart, and the heart is in the right place. Plus, the 2-DVD set is packed with all sorts of extra Christmas goodies. If \\"Elf\\" doesn't put you in a Merry Christmas mood, nothing will.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|This was a wonderful read. I love the the homoerotic overtures. I can imagine the scandal this must have caused.
B00433TO52|5.0|I find Shakespeare to be really absorbing, almost like a kind of meditation. Sometimes, I just like to zone out and read his flowing words and let them roll over me. It helps me, especially when I'm having a stressed time. I have so many dog-eared copies of his plays at home.  So when my sister recently gave me  an birthday/early xmas gift of a Kindle and a gift card, I couldn't wait to find Shakespeare.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this collection. It has all the usual plays and poems I know and a few I don't. And I love that! But what really is good for me is that I can take the Kindle with me, with Shakespeare and all the other stuff I've put on and want to put on, wherever I go. So if I'm on the subway or waiting in line somewhere, I can whip out my good old classics and read them and zone out a little.  Also, I found the Table of Contents nice and simple coz I can go from one play to the other so easily.<br /><br />Its wonderful!
B0040QYROK|5.0|To those individuals who are concerned about this latest (complete) version of \\"Metropolis,\\" you may go to the Kino.com website where they describe the most recent restoration of the film, that includes the additional 25 minutes of material found in the Argentinean film archives.  As for New Zealand material, I was able to find the following information on Wikipedia.com:    \\"In 2005, Wollongong-based historian and politician Michael Organ examined a print of the film in the National Film Archive of New Zealand. It had been thought that it was the same cut as the Australian version, but Organ discovered that it contained missing scenes not seen in the cut versions of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project currently under way, Organ contacted the German restorers about his find. The New Zealand print was found to contain 11 missing scenes and included seconds of footage which were missing from the Argentine print and also footage which could be used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the editor in charge of editing the New Zealand print for some unknown reason excised different scenes than that of the Australian print keeping scenes missing from other versions intact. It is believed that the Australian, New Zealand and Argentine prints were all scored from the same master. The newly discovered footage was used in the restoration project.\\"    So, unless another lost version emerges this latest incarnation would appear to be as good as it is going to get.
B000274THQ|5.0|This is a great movie that shows the struggles that a young boy goes through to make his mother happy. She is in bed and does not know that communism is over and he tries to make her think that nothing has changed in their country-Germany. You will laugh a lot and if you have ever lived in a communist country, this movie will make you smile adn relate to all the familiar issues they faced. Great movie!!

B0040JHXTI|5.0|For Bruce-ophiles or really anyone, it's a great package - the re-released Darkness sounds great, and really hits home after all these years. Not to take anything away from BTR but Darkness is probably Bruce's best overall album. (Or close.)  The Promise CD delivers, with several songs that would have been hits (and some were, for others). The documentary on the Darkness/Promise sessions is well done. Haven't finished with the final disc - the '78 Houston bootleg and recent NJ show. Great gift for someone else or yourself.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|Charlestown's claim to fame is producing the most bankrobbers per capita in the United States. That means, amongst other things, that Charlestown has a bad reputation and some pretty interesting lives. Amongst those are the people we pick up with who, along with a few faces that enter in some rather strange ways, as they find themselves doing the job. There are four of them; you have the leader, the wheelman, the guy with the temper, and the other guy. Along with the fact that they are really good is also the fact that they know it. This leads one to cockiness, one to want out, division in the others, and people who don't want them to walk away.<br /><br />The story is a rather good one with a few flaws that happen to get mixed in along the way. The worst of the flaws comes in the ending, too, when you really have to throw all doubt out the widow to see the scenario they build actually playing out (I am avoiding spoilers, too, so pardon the vague references). Suspension of disbelief is one of those things you have to carry with you into movies, however, and this is more than just a few scenes splashed together by adrenaline junies. You see other sides to the characters, and some of these are really tangled up. Amongst those are relationships that should not be carried out, a bond between thieves, and the question of what you own your home and how much it ultimately owns you.<br /><br />I have been a J.R. fan but not a Ben fan so it surprised me just how well they fit in. Then again, the role that B.A. got was one that had great support, and he really was the calm one of the bunch. I liked the acting side of the movie, the pace, the story that was going on, and even the look into the culture aroudn these nefarious people. In fact, I'd say the town really got a nice piece of acting out of these various portions of the persona. along with it was also the action which, seeing the pace and seeing the masks they robbed with and realy finding them creepy, playe dout perfectly.<br />There were flaws and some easy to spot plot transitions but these things happen. Besides, the movie had a great pace and didn't solely rely on these pieces.<br /><br />If you like action it has it. If you like a mix it has it as well. It isn't mindless but it isn't convoluted and, really, I'm glad that it is not. Too many things are and, well, that hurts. If this seems good then try it on because it kept my interest despite me not thinking it would.Considering I was not expecting alot and got so much, I would have to say I was happy with the outcome and would recomend this as well.e flaws and some easy to spot plot transitions but these things happen.

1439133948|2.0|I have to say, as a long time Bujold fan and former LASFS librarian I am disappointed in her latest work Cryoburn. Not COMPLETELY disappointed, it does have its bright points which make it almost acceptable but falls far short of the quality that we've come to expect from Ms. Bujold. I won't place blame directly on her since we don't know the conditions she had to write this under, which could be time pressure from a publisher to life events going on that none know about. But to write something so `generic', which is the nicest word I can think of for this then end it the way she did has really lowered my respect for her work... And in a way, ripped my heart out...  The only novel I can compare this to (IE- Not completely disappointing but close) would be Throne of Ringworld where the author himself Larry Niven could only say \\"I was under time pressure from the publisher...\\" without excusing himself at all.    Having read Ms. Bujold's works for over 20 years now, I've only ever had great to good things to say about her works. I won't spoil it for everyone by telling the story or the ending but I will say that she should've either left THAT ending out or gone farther with her \\"Aftermath's\\" and that her \\"drabbling\\" felt like a betrayal to some of us readers who have followed the Vorkosigan saga since before Miles' birth...    I will continue to read anything new she decides to put out in the series but A) this will probably be the last time I spend $25.00 for one of her books and B) she'd better follow it up a lot more quickly than normal with something stellar in the series or else she might find herself losing some of her followers...

067144901X|5.0|My little daughter loves this book. She is 18 months old. She will bring it to me saying \\"la la la la la la la\\" and I can tell her, \\"bring me the la la book\\" and she goes and gets it in a flash and scurries up to my lap to read it over and over again. She makes almost all of the animal sounds and loves making her own sound at the end. The best part about this book for me is it's length. You can easily read this book in a minute or two, and even for me, the words are not corny or trite and I don't get that bored reading it for her over and over again, because her reaction to it is so cute and funny. When she is upset and crying, this book generally can calm her down, she loves it that much. I plan on collecting especially books by this author for Penny. This book is *second* to [[ASIN:B002KQ6FJC Goodnight Moon]] for her, and for me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Today, I have received this dvd along with the No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism dvds. The dvd claims to be 60 minutes and since it was said to be an hour, I was going to do the whole dvd. But, I have done level one and two. I found the exercise to be on the level that I am on already and that's why I have done more than just level one.<br /><br />I found the exercises to be 28 minutes long with warm up, exercise and cool down. I've started level one at 5:51 p.m. and finished it at 6:19 p.m. that's 28 minutes.<br /><br />I've started level two at 6:20 p.m. and finished it at 6:47 p.m. - well, level two wasn't 28 minutes, but 27 minutes instead.<br /><br />So, the exercises are longer than 20 minutes. I will time the exercises again, when I do them. I will be doing level three soon, but not tomorrow. Maybe by Friday.<br /><br />I wanted a good hour workout, but I have gotten a good 56 minutes workout.<br /><br />I like the workouts. Along with my other dvds, it will help me reach my goal.
B001GQSY5K|1.0|Very dissappointed in this order, due to the seller. Seller said Video Game was New. New does not mean the disk is scratched, not in original wrapping, and not missing the instructions that come with a NEW purchase. This was defiantely used.    We contacting the seller first to give them a chance to fix this before we wrote a bad review and they did nothing to resolve this issue.    I have made hundreds of Amazon purchases, this is the FIRST I have given a bed review to.

I'm 40 lbs overweight, mostly because of too many carbs in my diet coupled with late night snack habits.

The book is well worth the investment if the reader is serious about gaining control of their eating habits.
B004DCB62M|2.0|If you wish to waste your time reading one of the great classics of detective fiction, this is a great price, and it's truly complete. I noticed very few typos, and the formatting was readable. However there were many minor gripes: 1.) Many of the illustrations were corrupted--totally unrecognizable. 2.)The table of contents is a bit of a joke, not even recognized by the Kindle as a TOC. It does make it easier to navigate, but it's painful. 3.) The footnotes are not linked--they should have either removed the numbers altogether, or linked them to the notes. 4.) Often, a strange formatting reflow problem would develop, and the lines of text would start as a new paragraph every sentence. Again, I can live with it, but I paid for this book--it should look like a book. 5.) No chapter divisions--this means if you want to skip a story, you have to use the next page button, rather than the five-way nav. Frown.    If this was a freebie, or from Gutenburg, I'd give it four stars, especially for the illustrations. But if I'm going to buy a public domain book, I'm buying it for the formatting. Look to a different e-dition to find top-notch formatting, please.

I must say I have a better understanding of what some people in society go through in order to achieve and maintain the lifestyle they are expected to live up to.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Should anyone wonder what mastery is, or looks like, or sounds like, then I believe this is it. I saw the concert live from the third row centre and I now know what perfection is in a musical sense. Is this the wonder of age, the fruit of experience paid for in the currency of time on this earth. Leonard and his chosen musicians are obviously at the highest level. In a world so youth orientated it is so refreshing to see the wisdom and maturity of age that so few manifest. Poetry and story telling set to great and diverse music that so perfectly fits does it for me, and what about the women's voices and presence - hallelujah! No wonder the standing ovation when leaving the stage for intermission, and the three at the end. Thanks Leonard and company, you have my vote for best DVD ever! James Middleton
B000002OK3|3.0|this cd is great for anyone that is nostalgic for a movie that they likely own.  these songs are great for the first couple listens, but then ... eh.  Dont get me wrong, there are a couple tracks that you can listen to repeatedly, but most of them you will burn out on within a couple listens. But lets face it, if these songs were not in the movie, you would not give two #%&!@ about them.      And now for the song hooked on a feeling. this is the most disjointed song, it sounds as if two seperate things, a mediocre song and an idiot doing african tribal impressions, were combined into one big ol' turd of a song.  the original version that contained sitar was not very good, the version on this cd is so much worse.  No one actually likes this song, they just think they do because Quinten (spelling?) Tarrantino likes it.  This song is completely immpossible to listen to and enjoy because it is so disjointed.  If you disagree with me and you like this song than you are no longer entitled to give your opinion on music to the world at all.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I've never been a big fan of buying an entire CD just for a few songs.  There are only three songs on the CD that I REALLY like and all the rest are ok.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I love the story of Secretariat. Disney did a great job with this movie.  Lane was fabulous.  Of course, it had it's \\"Hollywood\\" touch thrown in there, but if that gets more people to be inspired by this magnificent animal so be it.  Watch the movie, read the books, look up the original footage and be inspired by the greatness that was Secretariat!
0143113100|5.0|I had the great fortune of finding this book at a thrift store, mixed in with a bunch of worthless old novels. It was one dollar, so I thought \\"what the heck,\\" and picked it up. As I read through it I became increasingly amazed. The scientific content, writing style, and captivating stories combine to make this a top-tier popular science book. It is a great mixture of 1) raw facts about how brain plasticity works and how it is changing medicine, 2) fascinating stories of people overcoming serious neural problems by harnessing the power of neuroplasticity, and 3) inspiration for people who want to make changes in their life--for it clearly illustrates that the brain is capable of radical transformations.<br /><br />One of the wildest neuroplasticity stories is about a woman who completely lost her vestibular system (structures in the ears that allow your body to balance). This woman then regained her balance through the use of a new invention: a strip that sat on her tongue and informed her brain--through sensory nerves in the tongue--which direction she was leaning. The strip buzzes on the part of the tongue that corresponds with the direction the body is leaning, and somehow the brain is capable of using this information to create a new balance system! Another story, which seems to straddle that line between science and science fiction, is about a device that allows a blind person to see by buzzing on their back. A camera transmutes sensory information onto a grid of nodes that buzz in particular ways that correspond to the various properties of the visual field. The brain recieves this buzzing information through the sensory nerves of the back. Over time, this gives blind people (who were blind at birth) a primitive visual ability. How on earth does this work? As the supergenius who came up with the device says, \\"The eyes don't see. It is the brain that sees.\\" Wow!<br /><br />Other books that I have read about the brain (specifically Religion Explained by Pascal Boyer) stress the fact that the brain is composed of distinct modules that perform specific tasks. Although this is true, arguments that emphasize modularity can mislead readers into thinking that brain functions are completely fixed in specific locations. The reality is that the brain is modular, but also malleable. Brain functions can change locations in the brain, can take up more or less room in the brain, can be strengthened and revitalized after being severely damaged, and so on. This book gives many fascinating examples of such malleability.<br /><br />Yet in addition to offering intellectual stimulation, these facts also provide hope to those who struggle. I have personally struggled for a long time with a variety of psychological problems, namely depression, and this book has given me more hope than any other. I started meditating after reading this book because it convinced me that I have the power to actually physically change my brain--or, rather, that my brain has the power to change itself.<br /><br />What really makes this book a pleasure to read is that it is comprised of highly interesting stories. Each story pertains to neuroplasticity (brain malleability), but each is also interesting in its own right. Doidge, a practicing psychiatrist, gives an incredible personal account of treating one of his own patients who suffered from a disorder based on his mother's early death. He also tells stories about top brain scientists, describing their discoveries and their lives with the tact of a master journalist. It's fun to read, and highly educational.fact that the brain is composed of distinct modules that perform specific tasks.

B003DZX44I|5.0|No sense in reviewing the film itself, since it's 5-star material.    When I put the disc into my player, I swore I had never seen this film before. The colors are perfect, and I love the extended edition of the movie. It's a musical number that takes place right before the dinner and famous ballroom scene, showing how the occupants managed to take the castle from dirty and dilapidated to looking new. Overall, I think it's worth buying. The video quality is some of the best eye candy I've seen on Blu-ray.
B0043EV774|5.0|This is a wonderful story, a great movie and the 3D effects are superb!  I watched it on my Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, thru the Samsung BD-C7900 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Player.  The sound was thru the Onkyo TX-NR808 7.2-Channel Network Home Theater Receiver.  The 3D effects were flawless and the surround sound fantastic!<br /><br />The acting in the movie was one of the best I've ever seen.  My favorite was the \\"Red Queen\\" played by Helena Bonham Carter.  This movie will be appreciated by kids through adults and is excellent entertainment for anyone looking for a great 3D experience.<br /><br />The Four-Disc Combo is a great way to purchase a great movie.  If you don't have enough 3D glasses for a larger gathering, just watch the Blue-ray version instead.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|When it was released, I was under the impression that its just an action flick where they just keep doing miracles with the dagger. So not much of story behind. So didn't watch it in theater and was waiting for the blueray release. Finally rented it on netflix, and was pleasantly surprised with it.  Story: The story is while not excellent, but pretty good. It would have been even better with even more ancient persian background, more scences played out.  Characters: As hyped before movie release, the actress is not a pretty face; doesn't have the Arabian/Persian look which is the character she is playing. Actor while not excellent, delivers a pretty good role.   Overall: It was a good movie experience, and highly recommend to watch. I should have watched it in theater.
0439023483|5.0|So after months of seeing nothing but blog post after blog post for the release of Mockingjay, the third book in The Hunger Games Trilogy, after hearing a very close friend rave about the series, I caved. I went out and bought the first book, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />In the post-apocalyptic world, where North America once lay, is the country of Panem. With it's shining Capitol at the center of twelve districts. The Capitol rules all. The very lives of the people are not even under their own control, they live and die by the Capitol's generosity and greed.<br /><br />Seventy-five years ago there were thirteen districts, and there was a rebellion. The districts rose up against the rule of the Capitol. And were squashed. District 13 was destroyed utterly and the other twelve live an even more bleak existence. Since then, the Capitol, to remind the people of their absolute power and the futility of dissent, has required that each district provide two tributes. One girl and one boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen are taken to compete in the Hunger Games. A nationally televised event that pits these children against each other, and only one can come out alive.<br /><br />When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her place in the Seventy-Fourth Hunger Games she regards it as a death sentence. Having to feed and provide for her mother and younger sister for the last several years has made Katniss persevere. She already knows how to fight to live, how to endure difficulties, and it will take every inch of her abilities in order to gain success. But if she's going to win, Katniss is going to face hard decisions. Life against love. Survival against humanity. And at the end of it all, if she actually manages to succeed, will she be someone she can live with?<br /><br />Because I know there are people out there that haven't read these yet, I'm going to try to remain spoiler free. I really believe that this series is one that's best enjoyed as it unfolds. Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job of pulling me along and wringing emotions out of me, from smiles, to tears, to outright shock.<br /><br />Katniss has had a hard life. She lost her father quite a while before the story begins and because her mother was so stricken with grief, it fell to Katniss to make sure that her family lived. She became the main provider, going outside the electrified fences that surround the district in order to hunt. Learning to trade and bargain. Selling and buying in order to keep her sister from ever knowing the depth of despair she had. She's a strong heroine, but she's not perfect.<br /><br />She makes mistakes, misreads people and their objectives - even when it seems so clear to everyone else - and she can be exceptionally hard-headed. I admit that there were times when I wanted to shake her to make her see the truth of something, but in the end all it did was endear her more to me. Katniss is a heroine you can root for. Flaws and all.<br /><br />The relationships between Katniss and everyone around her was something I truly enjoyed. For all her rough edges, Katniss has a very big, soft heart and you could easily see that in her thoughts and conversations. From her family, to her mentor for the Games, to her fellow tribute, even other competitors in the arena, each interaction brought more...just more of everything. There were several times I was moved to tears and sometimes I was smiling through them.<br /><br />Beyond the characters, which I absolutely fell in love with, the world surrounded me in its embrace, holding me tight and showing me everything. I felt involved there, connected to the people and the place. More than anything I wanted to fight alongside them, with them, for them. Ms. Collins paints a vivid picture of a dark and gritty world, brushed with realism that, quite honestly, hit me like a punch to the gut.<br /><br />With my emotions, frequently, running high I raced through The Hunger Games anxious to see what would happen next. It kept me on the edge of my seat, staying up late into the night. In fact, I finished it around midnight on a Friday, fell asleep and woke up to immediately go to the store to buy the next two. Which I promptly read.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a dark, gritty, emotional story filled with pain, joy, loss and love. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a vivid world filled with characters that make you feel and a plot that doesn't let you go.y seat, staying up late into the night.

044654759X|5.0|I have read almost all of Sparks' books and enjoyed every one of them. Some are definitely better than others, however, and I am pleased to report that \\"Safe Haven\\" is Sparks at his finest. It is a well-told story about a young woman, Katie, attempting to start over after escaping from her abusive husband. His skillful handling of the difficult topic of domestic abuse is to be commended.<br /><br />As with all Sparks' stories, this is a love story. Despite all her intentions not to, Katie begins to fall for a local storekeeper, Alex, and his two young children. Alex is a widower who has been hesitant to give his heart away as well. Katie's neighbor and friend Jo encourages her to pursue their relationship, but cautions her not to break his heart. Katie and Alex cautiously fall in love, but their road to happy ever after is haunted by Katie's past. The ending of this book is the best part. I won't spoil it, but it literally gave me chills.<br /><br />This is a quick-read, which is a blessing, because you won't want to put this book down until you reach the very last word. If you are a Sparks' fan, you simply must read this book.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A wonderfully depicted retelling of the Dickens' classic!  The way they can animate the real actors is amazing.  While it was too \\"old\\" for my 3 1/2 year old grandson to enjoy, I loved it!  Hopefully he will grow to appreciate it when he is a little older.  The entire cast & crew hit this one out of the park!
B0043KK4N6|3.0|I was disappointed in the CD, especially the songs by Cher.  This is purely a personal opinion, but the music without the video lacks the excitement and vibrancy that one would expect from a musical on this topic.
0316017922|4.0|Interesting book, especially when read in connection with Mlodinov's \\"Drunkard's Walk.\\"  I'm not sure about the author's conclusions regarding education, but found his thesis regarding environmental factors as an influence on success as quite convincing.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is my second purchase of music by Melody Gardot and it is better than the first one.  The music is wonderful, the artistry is phenominal and the phrasing is right on target.  If you want to relax and de-stress after a hard day at work or just feel soothed, this is the music for you!  Bravo
B0009HLD0K|4.0|This is the story about a kid named Dennis Stohler in Bloomington, Indiana, who has ambitions to be an Italian college student bicyclist.<br />The trouble is that Bloomington is the home of Indiana University (Bob Knight, anyone?), and Stohler is neither an Italian nor a college student.<br />Instead, he is a \\"cutter,\\" a local term used derisively to describe blue collar non college student people of the town, with the term originating from the large numbers of people from the area who once worked in the limestone quarries that supplied the stone used in most of the buildings on campus and even in the Pentagon, Empire State Building, Lincoln Memorial, and Washington Monument.<br />Sadly, most of those quarries are now closed, and many of the craftsmen who once worked in those quarries have to resort to less prestigious jobs, and Dennis's father is one such man, owning a used car lot.<br />Dennis adopts an Italian accent and a few words in the language, while riding around campus on his ten speed to pose as someone he is not, even carrying on this way at home.<br />This eventually gets the attention of a beautiful coed, and - with his friends' help - he gains her affection.<br />Meanwhile, the annual bike race on the campus known as the \\"Little 500\\" is about to take place, and Dennis wants to enter the race, even though he is not a student.<br />The movie was filmed on location, and watching it, I was immediately quite familiar with each location, having lived in Bloomington and attended college and lived there for over four years.<br />It really is a beautiful campus, so this really provides some charm for the visuals.<br />There are lots of very funny moments here, especially his encounter with the young woman's boyfriend and his friend's on the spot decision to quit his job with his insulting boss.<br />There are also some surprisingly touching moments, especially the one in which his father takes him to one of the very few operating limestone quarries in the area.<br />Dennis's father (played by Paul Dooley) is clearly wistful for the days when he was once a proud artisan instead of a car salesman.<br />An interesting thing about this movie is that I don't recall seeing the actor who plays the main character of Dennis in any other movies since, while I have seen Dooley in a few, and two of the friends played by Daniel Stern and Dennis Quaid have a very long list of movies to their credit.<br />This movie always warms my heart with its take on life.<br />Corny?<br />Yes<br />Funny?<br />Very!<br />You'll really enjoy this one.<br />Check it out.
B000W1SB3U|5.0|Neil Young has toyed with so many genres - what makes his work so extraordinary is that he doesn't release a record until he has mastered said genre - \\"Weld\\" is a fine case in point (I don't like \\"grunge\\" per se - unless, of course, it's a Neil Young record!), as is \\"Old Ways.\\" This is truly an outstanding country record - one that even the casual fan can appreciate. If you're like me, \\"country/rock\\" is usually boring, maybe even pretentious - you know, \\"...get on one side of the fence or the other\\", frankly... \\"Old Ways\\" does just that - it's real country music for fiddlers or stoners - if you're a fan, it's a must - if you enjoy country music, and like hearing the rockers give it their best shot - this is the stuff!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|LMFAO I don't know why but when I read the 1 star reviews (except the ones about bad quality or wrong delivery) I always imagine a 7 yearsold kid writing it. Damn, people are really dumb. Being right, left, up, down, its all the same BS, its just a different name for the same disease, none of them is better than the other.. whatever. Now, to the movie, I liked it even if I do or don't agree with the ideas expressed in the film, I did liked it and I would see it again. 5 stars
B002ZIAC26|2.0|I should begin by saying that I have a limited frame of reference with regards to Beach House. I listed to Devotion a few times and remember liking it, but it never stuck with me. I would have never thought to check out Teen Dream but for the incredible hype surrounding it. I bought the album and was highly disappointed not because it's a horrible album (it isn't), but because all the glowing and drooling over this album doesn't seem proportional to what I'm hearing.<br /><br />Teen Dream strikes me as very flat, repetitive, monotonous, and one-dimensional. The songs seem to be crafted well enough and the production is top-notch (those are the two stars I give the album), but no matter how or how often I listen to it, I find myself getting intensely bored and have an irrepressible urge to move on to something more interesting. I feel that all the songs, while distinct enough, float along on the same plane, rarely deviating from the same clever/sweet/dreamy sound scape. I was initially tempted to conclude that my dislike of this album is just a matter of taste, as I do like plenty of dream-pop/shoegaze type music. Instead, I have to conclude that Teen Dream is, like the cover itself, just...bland and flat.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles. They are the standard in classic rock. They are the creators of todays music. Abbey Road was without a doubt the best music put out by any band that will never be duplicated. The music was so thought out and crafted with detail that even McCartney would find it hard to mimic what he did on that album. Hate them if you want but they are the industry standard when it comes to music and music writing.
B001993Y2C|3.0|I loved the Battlestar Galactica series, and I just couldn't wait to get the box set on Blue-ray, since I didn't have HD cable where I was living, and I wanted to see it all over again in its full glory. I wish I had waited for a less expensive box set to come out. This one was kind of cheesy and disappointing. The boxes containing the actual discs seem designed to scratch them, and I felt the need to be very careful extracting them. Also, a 'collector's edition' type of box set should be something you want to display, but I put this one on the back of the shelf behind other discs. The Cylon action figure was briefly amusing, but, really, plastic?! For this price I expect die cast metal. And, for this price I expected a better deal.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|First thoughts...Amazing! Better than the first. You've got James Cameron back behind the camera and he is very talented, which he proves from this movie. Anyways, here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--Of course this is going to be good! It's James Cameron (Avatar, Aliens, Titanic) again. Amazing job from one of the all time best directors.<br />2.  Script--Excellent story and writing from James Cameron and William Wisher. Better writing than the first one in my opinion. Nice job!<br />3.  Acting--Amazing again because you've got Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the title character. You also have Linda Hamilton back, Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong. Very nicely done.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=1/10. Both terminators are fully nude at one point in the movie but there is nothing bad.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=9/10. More violent than the original. Many people are killed by both teminators throughout. There is not a lot of blood though.<br />3.  Language=7/10. Just a tad worse than the first one. 18 F-words and other profanities.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It is hands-down better than the first one and always will be the best in the Terminator series. Excellent job from James Cameron. Highly recommended to everyone who enjoyed the first one.
B002ZG980U|2.0|I was going to let this review go because I got to see INCEPTION via Amazon's Video On Demand for free as part of a promotion.  Still, as an aspiring screenwriter and basic movie fan, I've got to say something here.    (If like me you hate spoilers, scroll to the bottom of this review and read the last line.  Otherwise, I proceed as if you've already seen the film.)    If you think INCEPTION is simply amazing -- you've been scammed.  I know, this is a sacrilege of modern cinema to suggest the 'genius' behind DARK KNIGHT could possibly misstep, but INCEPTION only solidifies my view that Nolan has a reality distortion field around him that Steve Job's would envy.    First of all, there is a thing known in screenplays known as 'exposition'.  Exposition is when the characters explain the story to YOU to make sure you understand what's going on and what it means.  The more time the story spends explaining the story, the weaker and more convoluted the story.  Too much exposition reveals a core flaw of a screenplay -- in that -- instead of having fun with the story, the story spends too much time explaining itself.    INCEPTION is wall to wall exposition.  It should have been called EXPOSITION it's so bad.  It never lets up, and the reason is NOT because the film is such a 'clever engaging 'mind-bender'.  The story never stops explaining itself to you is it's poorly constructed.      There are simple work-arounds to make a story present itself more clearly.  It's called a second draft.    For instance, the story uses an old device known as 'explain it to the newbie'.  The Juno actress is brought in as a newbie and the entire dreaming world is explained to her.  Piece by piece.  As it's explained to her, it's explained to us.   Get it?  You've seen it a million times.  AVATAR used it too.  The problem here:  we didn't need the explanation.    You think I'm nuts.  The story was confusing as hell and OF COURSE we needed the 'tell it to the newbie' trick to follow what was going on.  Salami.    Was the plot really that difficult to follow?  The way it was presented, absolutely, but let me prove to you how simple to plot actually was:  a team of dream re-enginners attack a sleeping son of a businessman and insert into his mind the desire to dissolve his Dad's business.  In order to implant this idea the dream re-engineers must create three dreams within a dream to pull this off, and have a matter of minutes in the first dream, hours in the second, and weeks in the third.    Isn't that basically it?  Yup.  Isn't that nice and clean and simple?  Yup.  Could that have been elegantly explained in a few opening scenes.  Yup.  Did this team need to pull in a newbie device and risk their lives on a novice?  Nope.    INCEPTION takes ONE HOUR to explain what I just explained in two sentences.  Not because it's cool and clever and wildly imaginative... but because it's poorly written rubbish.    Oh, I know, the fans of this film just shuttered.  Rubbish?  Impossible!  \\"Why this was the director of DARK KNIGHT for crying out loud and INCEPTION made a fortune at the box office too!\\"      Stop being a fanboy and ask yourself this:  was this Leonardo's best work?  When you think of what a great actor he can be, is this one of the movies you'll think of first?  I won't.      I swear he spent the entire film with the same one pained look.  Downright constipated if you ask me.  I think he was supposed to be an emotionally distraught dude hiding a 'secret' that Juno girl eventually uncovered, but that doesn't explain his one note performance.    The reason he looked so desperate and scared was that there no character to grab onto.  Leo's character was like all the characters in this piece:  one note comic book bad@sses.  Absolutely nothing more.  Pink Fluffernutter in dark suits.    Modern cinema (I just hate putting those two words together) has this scam that's in nearly all 'big' movies these days -- and -- audiences consistently fall for it box officeweekend after box office weekend.  It is:  any one of us could be a bad@ss, and when you join a team of bad@asses... wow... aren't you REALLY COOL.    The scam of a movie like INCEPTION isn't that the idea of dream re-engineering is cool.  That's actually a good idea.  The scam is that you could be one of these people -- that you're smart enough and tough enough to swagger like the idiots in this film.  That each one of us is really just a James Bond in discounted jeans.  That's what you're really being sold here.    Yes, I know, that all movies invite us into a character and give us a chance to be someone else.  But you know what?  In good movies -- in your best Bond movies -- you feel like there's an actual person there as well.   That, yes, you can pretend to be Bond at times, but at other times, you must face you're not Bond and James is.  This is why Bond can be amazing - because you must admit he's a bad@ss and you're not.    When watching INCEPTION I merely see a room of nothings running around from dream to dream.  I didn't really buy that any of these people were real or mattered.    For example, Leo cared very much about his wife.  He wanted to be with her.  Did we care about her?  Did WE want to be with her?  Nope.  Remember why?  She came off as a psychotic during most of her scenes.    The movie pulls Juno girl out of nowhere.  She was in school but was -- oddly -- ready and willing to leave it at a moment's notice.  No boyfriend or family, no fear that some insane caper might destroy her mind and body.  Did they offer her money?  Did they promise her a place in a grad school?  I don't remember hearing any such offers.  Do you?    INCEPTION isn't about really exploring this cool dream idea and making it real.  It's merely about inviting you along as a member of a team of bad@asses AND escorting you through a series of reasonably impressive CGI.  THAT'S ALL.  It's so that you can leave the cinema with a big swagger and feel cool.    You know how some people simply HATE Apple for selling cool over anything else?  That just having a Mac is cool in and of itself?  That's all INCEPTION is.  Stop pontificating about how 'amazing' it was.      It wasn't.  It was just okay at best.  Must NOT hurry to see cinema.    Still not buying this?  Think about the plot again.  The motivation behind Leo's quest.  Leo has taken a job to break up a corporation so that it's competitor can make even bigger profits.  Did you catch that?  It's not that the corporation that's being broken up is 'evil'.  It wasn't.  So Leo is really working on behalf of an 'evil' corporation that's attacking another corporation for immense greed and profit.    ... yay?    Wouldn't it simply be cheaper for the competing corporation to buy off the son instead of this completely insane and convoluted plot?  I know, I know, when you go see a fantastic movie you have to give them a little elbow room.  I did.  But INCEPTION demands a stadium of elbow room... just for starters.    Did you notice how Juno girl was amazingly perceptive?  I mean she's not just an amazing 'maze' girl, or scientific mind, but she's also a perceptive psychotherapist?  All this in a youthful package which OH SO CONVENIENTLY is a voicebox for the smarter/aged screenwriter?  Yes, I know, she's as cute as hell, but I didn't let my hormones distract me from the simple fact she was a %100 unbelievable character.    And speaking of hormones:  why wasn't Leo interested in this girl?  Or this girl interested in Leo?  Yes, I know, Leo was obsessed with his psychotic wife, and Juno girl was afraid that Leo might be a mental case.  Still, there's something in heterosexual oriented movies known as 'the love interest' which Juno girl would have been perfect for... had she been cast as an older woman.  But poor INCEPTION was so busy explaining and reexplaining the world's most unnecessarily complex plot that --    -- it has absolutely no time for a few genuinely emotional moments between Leo and Juno.(I should look up their real character names, shouldn't I?  But since they weren't really characters -- since the writer/director didn't bother to rewrite his opus -- I'll be similarly lazy.)    But the special effects were awesome, you say like a trained monkey?  Okay, alright, let's discuss two of them to put this sorry movie out of it's misery.    When Juno girl first discovers she's not on a street but really in a dream world, the entire street begins erupting.  Poof-pang-kapliff!  So COOL, right?  Wrong.  Tell me, why didn't it ever do this again when other characters were outright told that the world they thought was real was actually a dream?      I bet you didn't notice that, did you?  Know why?  You were so captivated by the cool poof-pang-kapliff effect you forgave the story for making no sense.  That it didn't even follow its own rules.    Remember when Juno girl folded the street up and over?  A really really COOL special effect... utterly wasted.  What if during one of the chase scenes she invoked it to flip the car behind them?  That would have been really SMART, right?  You know, using a skill they had to alter the situation?  The reason why they didn't do this --    -- was because the story wasn't following it's own rules.  They were shifting at the whims of story and CGI. Face it:  this is yet another special effects feast that's exciting to watch once and never again.     Overlong, way too much exposition, too many characters, all characters were Pink Fluffernutter, a stunningly convoluted plot, a hero (?) on an extremely selfish quest, a sidekick too smart to believe and too hot to ignore, a third act stolen frame for frame out of FOR HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and yet another story that invites you to 'be all you can be' so that you can leave the cinema feeling COOL with a BAD@SS swagger.    INCEPTION is a scam.     If you rolled your eyes at AVATAR, you'll roll them here too.
B0013ND36G|5.0|First thoughts...It's pretty good. Compared to the first two, it's a piece of crap. Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--Good job from Jonathan Mostow (U-571 and Surrogates). I think that this was the worst in the series because you don't have James Cameron back behind the camera. Even though, the directing was good.<br />2.  Script--Good writing job from John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Nice writing and they did a good job continuing the Terminator universe storyline.<br />3.  Acting--Just like the first two, the acting is supurb. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back again. You also have Nick Stahl and Kristanna Loken.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, language and brief nudity.<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=3/10. One nudity scene from Kristanna Loken. It is brief as the rating ensures.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. There is still a lot of violence just like the first two.<br />3.  Language=6/10. Very low on language. Only 3 F-words and other profanities.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall, still 5/5. Even though it is horrible compared to the first two movies, it is still pretty good if you don't compare it. In my opinion, they shouldn't have made it if James Cameron wasn't directing.
1573300403|3.0|I bought this DVD for my Grandson who is 6 because he likes MJ's stage moves and energy. I don't mind him watching talented entertainers like MJ and i will not expose him to untalented phoney so called performers of the day in which unfortunatley there are too many. If you can't sing and you must talk in time to the same base beat don't call it singing please. I have heard too many singing live on TV that were off key and flat and just awful or use a voice synthesiser aid to help them cover up their lack of talent. Thank God for real talent like Elvis and Michael Jackson we can see entertainment at its best. There are some duds on this DVD but when MJ is on he is really on and all other entertainers of today pale in comparison. Elvis, Michael rest in peace knowing there are no others like you.
B001FB55I0|5.0|*Note* This review is for the theatrical version ONLY.<br /><br />First thoughts...It's not bad. I was a little worried about this one because it got a PG-13 rating when the first three were all R. It was actually very good though. Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--Good job from McG (Catwoman). It had a very good camera job, I was impressed.<br />2.  Script--Good script from the same people who wrote Terminator 3, John Brancato and Michael Ferris.<br />3.  Acting--Very good. You have an all-star cast. Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Oh, and let's not be forgetting Michael Ironside.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=2/10. There is a brief scene where a terminator is shown fully nude but his genitals are blurred by smoke.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. Even though it got a PG-13, it is still pretty violent.<br />3.  Language=4/10. Least language of all the Terminator movies. A couple S-words and other profanities.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I enjoyed this one far more than Terminator 3. Still, it would have been better if James Cameron directed it.
0316098337|5.0|I loved this book! Once you get used to Jack's writing, Emma Donoghue does an EXCEPTIONAL job into giving us an idea of what it would be like to be a five year old when all you know is the small confinement you have lived in for five years. She also does a wonderful job with illustrating what issues victim's of sexual abuse go through even after they are safe. Their agony goes on long after their abuser has been captured. I love the fact that Ms. Donoghue has brought to light the struggles of the sexually abused and how it not only affects them but others, like Jack! Thanks Emma, job well done!!!
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|First thoughts...Very good older movie. This was my first James Cameron film and there were more to come. Very original at the time it was made and one of the all time best films ever. (Not in my opinion, but in others). Anyways, here's the breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Directing--Amazing job with the camera from lengendary filmmaker James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic, Aliens). The only thing I didn't like were the special effects, but at the time they were very good, so I won't complain.<br />2.  Script--Good writing by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It was an original story at the time it was made and it had good characters and dialogue.<br />3.  Acting--Amazing job because of the all-star cast. You've got Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton and Lance Henriksen. Very good job with the cast.<br /><br />Now for the content review.<br />Rated R<br /><br />1.  Sex/Nudity=6/10. Not bad but there is a sex scene between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were bare breasts are shown. There is also a scene where the Terminator is shown fully nude, but it is in shadows and is kinda of hard to see.<br />2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. This is a violent movie. There are many people that get shot throughout the movie. Probably the most gory scene is when the terminator shoves it's hand through a man's chest.<br />3.  Language=7/10. Not too bad, but enough to ensure an \\"R\\" rating. 11 F-words and other profanities.<br /><br />Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. This is an amazing movie by an amazing director. It is a movie that any movie-goer must see before they die. Highly recommended to everyone.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little guy works great. I typically use a Lansky system to sharpen my knives but when hunting/camping/hiking I want something smaller and lighter. This quality sharpener fits that bill. It makes a good sharp edge on my blade at lightning speed and its size and weight let me carry it anywhere and everywhere I want to go. The down side to this handy tool is that the gut hook/serration sharpening rod is too course for my taste but it too does a great job of getting those hard to sharpen areas sharp. I think perhaps they should add a ceramic rod as well. If you need to sharpen you blades on the go, this is a great tool. I recommend picking one up for you outdoors types!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I personally haven't seen this movie yet, but it's Pixar so come on - what more do you need to know.  My nieces are in love with it, however, so I am definently looking forward to watching it with them very soon.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I have struggled with anorexia for well over 20 years. I was initially a bit tepid about reading Portia's account of battling this disease. I was afraid it would be triggering for me. Yet, the message spoke so clearly to me. I could not pass this book up. I am so glad I read it. This is a very candid and honest look at how the disease sneaks into your mind until it controls your life. Every waking moment is spent worrying about it. I hope some of the cruelly overcritical people read this book. I think it will change their words, as I feel many just don't understand the damage their words can cause. I'm grateful Portia peeled back the mask of this destructive disease to let everyone see just how truly ugly it is. To think we literally starve ourselves, sometimes to actual death, is upsetting. I think this book will open the eyes of many. I hope it helps people understand how hellish it really is. I'm so proud of Portia for speaking the often ugly truth. It's very hard to talk about your eating disorder. She's very brave. I read this book in just a few days. It's well worth everyone's time.

B002ZG99CM|5.0|After watching this movie find out Jackie can play a different roll then he usually did.  Very good teacher in the movie, brings out the tradition of the Chinese culture.  Smith is good too, wish this movie will make him understand Chinese martial art and Chinese culture.  This experience can be useful forever.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Dr. Mukherjee has written the most riveting history of science that I've read since Watson's The Double Helix.  Extremely well-written, spanning centuries of theory, logic, discovery and error, and touching on both laboratory science and clinical practice, The Emperor of All Maladies stuns in its sweep and ambition.  Mukherjee distills difficult concepts into readily available ideas through his effective use of scientific specificity and apt metaphor, a rather stunning achievement.  He brings to life the very real people who have taken on the challenge of discovering the mystery that is cancer.  The book helped me understand why it has been so difficult to find the \\"one method\\" or \\"one treatment plan\\" to suit cancer's heterogeneity.  Astonishing work, well worth your time and money.  I look forward to reading more of Dr. Mukherjee's writing in the future.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This is a five stars exciting movie, good in an angle, recommend anyone who like action movie to have it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is the kind of film that you either love or hate. Just head over to any movie review website and you will see this first hand. I myself absolutely loved it. The idea of entering people's dreams is certainly not a new premise in Hollywood however, with that being said, this film take the concept to completely new heights. As the title of my review states, very few directors could have pulled this scrip off successfully. It could have easily become convoluted, confusing, and bogged down with exposition. Christopher Nolan does a remarkable job and I have no doubts that is mostly due to the control he had over this film as he wrote, produced, and directed.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away in this review so ill give just the basic premise and its actually quite simple. People can enter other people's dreams and steal information. Leonardo Dicaprio's character, Dominick Cobb, is one of the best at doing just this and ultimately he winds up being hired by Ken Watanabe's character, Saito, to enter a competitors mind but this job isn't about stealing information, its about planting an idea in this persons mind, a process called Inception. Were led to believe by many characters that such a thing is not possible yet Cobb disagrees and takes the job.<br /><br />That's as far as I will go in regards to actual details about the film as I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. Ill simply say that it winds up being one of the most complex science fiction films I have ever seen yet Nolan never loses control with this film. Everything is masterful sewn together and the experience is second to none. Everyone gives an outstanding performance especially Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Tom Hardy's performance in particular really blew me away. This film would not have been the same without him.<br /><br />I simply have to mention the score as it was absolutely brilliant and ultimately its one of the best scores I have ever heard. I have to admit I was surprised when I heard Hans Zimmer was the composer. Don't get me wrong Zimmer is a master but his work is usually more predictable and his scores always seem to have a similar feel to them. His work with Nolan on The Dark Knight and now Inception have really pushed Zimmer creatively and ultimately Inception is a different kind of score than I think he's ever delivered before. In all honesty if someone had come to me with this soundtrack a couple months ago, before I saw the film, and asked me to guess who the composer was, Zimmer would have been one of my last guesses. It really is one of his most original compositions.<br /><br />Bottom line - Inception is hands down one of the best films I have seen in years. It has an amazing story, a great cast, some outstanding special effects and one of the best scores I have ever heard. In the hands of most directors this film would most likely have been a blabbering mess but Nolan's dedication to detail makes the delivery of this film practically flawless.<br /><br />5 stars!!ave ever heard.

0061655554|5.0|Wonderfully vivid and thorough account of the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. I heard of the book from a fellow student during a study session for a Business Strategy class. We were studying M&As, portfolio theory, and divestitures. While discussing the various reasons different M&As can fail, the issue of leveraged buyouts came up. I took the recommendation to read this book, and it has greatly exceeded my expectations.
B00005ONMP|5.0|If you've been considering purchasing this collection grab it! Excellent performances and recordings highlight this set. It easily becomes my top pick when I want to hear Mendelssohn from my library. The price was great too.
0553582038|5.0|Yes, we know that A Dance with Dragons is not out yet, that its been delayed for over 5 years, that the forums and comments here are dedicated by a vocal few to expressing their petty frustration. Fact is that GRRM is an amazing, talented writer and that A Song of Ice & Fire is a modern masterpiece of fantasy. No matter what naysayers decry, GRRM delivers another triumph in his series. Read it for yourself and see.<br /><br />Nuff said.
0345505387|4.0|This didn't really go with the other books, it had a different story line than the first outlander book. It kinda throws you off when you know how the story goes then you read this and you're like that didn't happen in the first book.
0785139168|5.0|Great, excellent, we received this issue (marvel classics format) in excellent conditions.  My 12 year and 8 year daughters have enjoyed it so much that we have rented the movie, since they have become interested in Austin's writtings, great way to spend Christmas vacations.
0307474712|3.0|This novel will appeal to readers who like novels with characters they can 'identify with'. One Day, tracing the lives of Dexter and Emma will identify with many British readers. Both main characters lead lives embroiled in social and political environments that will be familiar with anyone who has grown up in the Britain of Thatcher, Major and Blair. Their stories have the universal quality that writers strive for, and I think this is why the book is so popular.<br /><br />Yes the writing is pretty lowbrow, and the much vaunted wit of David Nicholls is not particularly apparent. One particularly poorly drawn minor character Ian, a boyfriend of Emma during one of her hapless phases, relies too much on forced stand up comedy lines. But the quirky love story is genuine and affecting, and (albeit partly through a plot climax featuring a rather forced deus ex machina) many readers will find themselves welling up somewhat over the final pages.<br /><br />Not a heavy read, but good on the details of 80s, 90s and naughties Britain - the rise of 'media', the struggles of people with a genuinely left wing conscience, the difficulties of making a fulfilling living in a genuinely worthwhile career, the obsession with youth, beauty and 'self', the extortionate property prices.<br /><br />The middle brow writers that dominate the media - Tony Parsons, Nick Hornby, you know the types, have been drooling all over this book and it is easy to see why: they wish they had written it. The movie will surely follow.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I admit that I wasn't in a big rush to run out and buy this movie but I am sorry it took so long for me to jump on the bandwagon. Our family of 5 (ages 42, 35, 18, 13, and 5) ALL love this movie. It is a HUGE hit with my 5 year old daughter who went through a period where she wanted to watch it every day and even still requests to watch it at least twice a week. What I am most amazed at is that my youngest picks up on the whole growing up and passing your toys on to other children theme. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Great movie!

0061714372|5.0|This is an odd review for me to write as I usually read and comment on historical subjects and other scholarly works (I'm an historian), but I also happen to love Megadeth.  So, I stumbled across Mustaine's autobiography and promptly downloaded it to my iPad.  What a read!  If it were not for my tendency to sleep and eat at least once a day I would have finished it in one sitting.      Mustaine is obviously a must read for any Metal fan, but it would also be enlightening for anyone else struggling through similar circumstances trying to find meaning in their own life.  I have led a very different path than Mustaine, but the parallels are there in enough abundance that his book held a deep personal message for me.  I can't imagine anyone reading this book, especially those who have gone through some of the same crap Mustaine has in his own life, not being affected positively in some way.  Mustaine does not preach for sure.  Neither does he come off as someone who has found the answers for everyone; but he does share intimately the reason for his life having significance beyond profane carnal and egotistical fulfillment, and especially the deadly road that a person's life can take not having found it.  This, I believe, is the reason for his goodness as a person and continuing greatness as musician today.      All of us classic Metalheads who have kept touch with the music of Megadeth are in awe of the material Mustaine has produced over the last several years, especially given the apparent decline of Megadeth (and Metal in general) throughout the late 90's and early century.  But Mustaine, and with him Megadeth has been resurrected to such astounding heights that even transcend the `classic' Megadeth of the 80s and early 90s.  Even the new Metal kids love it.  For all of us balding, bulging, aging Metalheads trudging towards (or through) middle-age life, the music of Megadeth gives us hope that some things do get better with age and we can sometimes outdo our youngerselves with a sharper edge and greater intensity than ever before.  It's all about focus; and that focus must be on that which is greater than oneself.     There is (not shockingly) much in this book about the Metallica-Megadeth rivalry.  From the perspective of this aging rocker (me), Metallica has been a grievous disappointment through the later years...and this is coming from someone who was long a member of the Metallica faction.  Mustaine had been for most of his career always a step behind the great monster of Metallica; but no more.  He has surpassed them.  This may not be Mustaine's opinion (he seems to still believe otherwise), but it is my own.  This book helps explain why.  I sadly doubt that Metallica will ever regain, let alone surpass the great band it once was.  Megadeth on the other hand has never been better.  Looking at it from their careers as a whole and where they are now there is little doubt amongst those of us that were fans of them both from the very beginning that in the end - Mustaine has finally won!
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|I ordered this case with a PowerShot SD1300. To my surprise this bag was way too large for that camera. Its not apparent from the description how large this case is. I could easily fit two cameras in the bag.<br /><br />Now apart from that:<br />The case is really well made, the zipper handles have a very nice feel. All the seams felt strong. The interior is nicely cushioned. A convenient pocket for battery and extra memory card.<br /><br />Overall:<br />If you have a relatively large camera this is a perfect bag. For smaller cameras get a different small bag.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I bought this second set to have it with me to watch with my granddaughter, 7 years old.  She loved it. We have to fast forward over some scenes. But this blew me away: our four-year-old granddaughter loves it just as much.    It truly is incredible.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I loved this book! Somewhere in the middle it starts dragging a bit but the romance between them is very cute. And I'm ok wth the middle dragging a little because the ending was good. One of the best parts is that the chapters alternate between the perspectives of the two main characters Grace (main character) and Sam (werewolf who Grace falls in love with). Great book I recommend it for amyone who loves young adult fantasy!
B003PTP4S6|5.0|They say Secretariat was the horse God built, I would agree. God must also love beautiful music. Yo Yo Ma plays the cello like no cellist I have ever heard. God surely had a hand in his development. I played the cello for six years, and heard many very good cellists, but Yo Yo Ma is just magnificent. His music is beautiful, soulful, words just can't describe. I heard a phase once, music of the sounds of heaven, indeed.........
B002ZG99QS|4.0|Very decent sequel to the original Tron. I got goose bumps when I watched this in the theater.  It's been a long time coming but finally a sequel was done.    Tron Legacy is a visually sound movie experience.  The 200 million dollar budget over the movie definitely shows on screen.  The incredible musical score by Daft Punk fits the film PERFECTLY and it definitely felt like this was taken right after the original TRON.     Story: Kevin Flynn, the hero from the original movie, took over Encom but then mysteriously vanished. Sam's gets an s.o. s from Flynn's old arcade house. He gets there then he gets thrown back into the digital world of Tron (just like Flynn did in the original movie). Sam has to fight in the games of the grid like his father did all the while trying to get to his father, so the two can find a way out of the grid. Kevin it turns out was betrayed by his program, Clu, who has decided to take over the whole grid killing any programs and anomalies that threaten him.    I read a couple of the critiques about the film with regards to the story, and the critics do have some valid points. The story told is pretty simple, and could have been reworked a bit more to  take full advantage of all the elements from the original movie including the actual character of Tron/ Alan Bradley  (Bruce Boxleitner) whose inexplicably reduced to a minor role....    However, with that said, the writers didn't lose sight of the main character of Kevin Flynn who was the main character of the original movie. Jeff Bridges hasn't played the role in more than twenty eight years, but as the great actor he is, easily starts out where he left in the original and takes the character into another direction. Kevin Flynn is now older and as such is a wiser,  darker,  more mysterious character, not the same naïve guy he was in the first movie.    Joseph Kosinki's directorial style is good. He throws a lot of references to the original movie and uses a couple of comedy bits, but the movie for the most part has a dark and futuristic look that gives fans a good feel of where exactly the Tron universe has evolved too since the last movie.    The movie  is definitely a visual spectacle for the eyes. Everything has been upgraded from the original, and you definitely do get the realism like the original that this guy has been sucked into the movie. The light cycles have been upgraded, and you see programs disassembled and destroyed In more graphic fashion than in the original movie. We also get the cool hand to hand disc battles that were in the original with the exception now that the fights borrow a lot from motion style of fighting. There are added new gadgets like the light jets and light cars.    There's also besides the visual feats as mentioned an incredible music score by French musicians Daft Punk (who have a small cameo in the movie as a couple of digital Dj's). Daft Punk's score is definitely another element that really made the movie quite an experience.     The performances in the movie are good.  As talked about Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn has grown from the original movie. He's no longer the that naïve hacker with a love for computers, now he's older and seen his great creation once again perverted again.  Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn does his role well as the estranged son here. Olivia Wilde as his would be love interest is also pretty good.      Tron Legacy is a good sequel that definitely lives up the hype surrounding it. Studios gave the director a mighty big budget to work with, and he took advantage of it. It's true the script and story could have been better but as far as what happens to the main character of Kevin Flynn, they did answer a lot of questions that we wanted to know since the first movie and introduced a couple of new ones for possible sequels. If there are plans for further entries in the franchise then they must include a deeper story that takes more advantage of the characters from the original including Tron.  As far as this movie goes,  I think they got right what they were supposed to do which is get news fans interested in the franchise, and get older dedicated fans of  the original something to look back on.
0307474712|5.0|The two main characters in the book graduated University just ahead of me, so the story resonates, it brought back memories. I enjoyed the concept and the story very much. My mom tried to read it and really couldn't get along with it.
0064430227|4.0|I liked the creativity of the story.  It had good reviews so I read it to my 3 year old son, however, he lost interest halfway through the book.  I will continue reading it as I think he is interested, except the length of the book may be too long to hold his attention.     This is better for older children, maybe above 4 years old.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is by far the best, most versatile and useful knife I have ever owned.  If you are searching for an all-purpose knife for the outdoors that is going to stand up to whatever you have planned for it (and even things you haven't planned) then look no further.  This knife will baton, chop, cut, carve, slice, notch, feather stick, pry, skin and clean game...and do just about anything else you can think of.  This thing is a tank...a workhorse knife.  Now, some people have complained that the Grivory handle leaves a little to be desired in feel and traction and that the handle even became loose while processing large pieces of wood.  I can't comment on this as I replaced the Grivory handle with the KA-BAR Micarta handle as soon as I received the knife.  The Micarta handle is a little thicker and does feel better in the hand and I have not experienced this handle becoming loose with heavy use.  If you aren't wanting to spend the extra $40 on the Micarta handle then you can either carry an allen wrench with you in case you need to tighten the handle or you can simply use some loctite on the screws in the handle to ensure that you won't experience this problem.  In my opinion, you are purchasing the blade...not the handle.  The Kydex Sheath is well made and fits snugly.  In fact, you may have trouble drawing the knife out of the sheath for the first few dozen times...very good retention with this sheath.  The knife also wears very nicely on the hip.  You would think that the knife may bounce around on your hip while walking but it doesn't.  The weight of the knife (1 pound) keeps it securely at your side while in the sheath.  You may need to check your local state laws on the size of knife that is legal to carry around but, here in Texas this knife is perfectly legal to carry (5 1/2 inch blade).  I highly recommend this knife for outdoor activities; camping, hiking, hunting, etc.  For the price ($54.99) you can not beat it.  I may even purchase another one...that's how good this knife is.ood this knife is.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|My incandescent bulb was broken, so I tried purchasing a 5 watt LED bulb to replace it. It arrived without breakage, and its light is as bright as my previous 30 watt bulb. By the way, it turns on instantly without flicker. So I decide to buy two to replace my bulbs.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Hmmm, I won't repeat all the hype, as you have probably read it already. Well balanced liberal minds will most likely enjoy this film, homophobes and up tight religious folks might not. So, kick back, fasten your seat belts and immerse yourself in two hours of great entertainment and acting. Enjoy!!!
B00428CPUY|5.0|This is a great DVD.  I have the ones from 2004 and 2007 (which I love), and this one rates up there pretty highly.  Eric brings in artists of all different flavors with one thing in common - they're very serious about the guitar.    My favorite tracks are:    Promise Land: Sonny Landreth, Eric Clapton  Midnight in Harlem: Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Warren Haynes  Going Down: My first real exposure to Joe Bonamassa who plays a killer lead  Waiting for the Bus: ZZ Top  Our Love is Fading: Sheryl Crow, Eric Clapton, Doyle Bramhall II  One More Last Chance: Vince Gill (plays incredible country leads)  Vonetta: Earl Klugh  Who Did You Think I Was: John Mayer  Had to Cry Today: Winwood, Clapton

0740748475|2.0|This collection wasn't really what I hoped for.  I purchased it because my softcover collection was getting worn out and I wanted a complete replacement collection of C&H material.  Though it is basically a complete NEWSPAPER STRIP collection it is missing a lot of art and extra poems, etc. that are in the softcover books.  On the positive side the paper quality is quite good; the colored comics are vibrant and the strip layouts (slightly altered but still in correct story order)look great more spaced out and printed larger than in the softcover books.  The intro by B.W. at the beginning of vol. 1 and the original dates of publication printed on the bottom of every page are a cool feature of the set.  Unfortunately, that's about the only good things about this collection.    The binding on MY set is pretty good compared to some other postings' complaints but it's still cheaply made with glued in pages instead of properly threaded pages.  The fabric on the outer slip case and the books wears through to the card stock underneath easily and the new art featured on the slip case is a cheap paper sticker that's glued to the front and back panels. The corners peel up easily if you aren't careful.  Would have been way nicer to see those pictures as an inlay of some kind in a leather-bound case or something like that.  Also, the color scheme of the set is kinda gross with brown fabric and brownish orange card stock.  Would have been cooler to see black and orange (like a tiger) or some other more appealing color scheme.  The set is also way too heavy.  Dropping even a single book will result in damaged and crushed corners and probably busted bindings.  Overall, the construction is cheap and isn't meant for repeated readings and handling.  Hopefully in the future there will be a true complete collection of C&H with all art, strips etc. presented in a high quality set.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed the movie, Cranford which we have, so we bought the Return to Cranford.  It was very enjoyable and followed with the same characters of the first DVD but the young lad is now more grown.  It is a movie that stays with reality of this world but isn't so dark as to leave you hating the ending.  It is very well directed and written with wonderful actors filling the parts.  This series is one that we will continue to re-watch more often than most movies we have.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I've been a fan of daft Punk for a few years. When I found out they were doing the soundtrack...I was thinking it was a bad idea. I was expecting they were going to turn Tron in to a dance fest.. I will say they did a fantastic job. This is a more darker sound than the original which fitted perfect. A little disappointed they didn't add a snippet of the original Tron theme but that's cool. They made it their own.
B003J7HOKU|5.0|Alot of people dont liek the production of this album because of how overly produced Horizons was, but i prefer the raw sound of this album as they did away with the hevily overtriggered bass drum in the previous album and this one you can definetily tell its not triggered. more of a natural sound and the song writing in this album is exceptional.
0446195529|4.0|I've read all of Baldacci's works, and to be honest, I haven't always been impressed. His earlier books, while having good storylines, simply failed to get my attention. It wasn't until he wrote \\"Last Man Standing\\", that he gave a clear indication of just what he was capable of, & how good an author he could be. Unfortunately, not all of the following titles met the benchmark of \\"Last Man Standing\\". However, they were much better than his earlier books. And if \\"Hell's Corner\\" is typical of the high standard we should expect from Baldacci in the future, then clearly, his finest moment is well on its way. For \\"Hell's Corner\\" is an excellent book. It grips from page 1, and doesn't let go until the final unravelling of the case, and a couple of twists in the tail, added in for good measure. This is one of those novels that you don't want to put down; one where you just have to read another chapter, and then another, and another, and so on until the book is finished. And thankfully, the ending is not a let down. Baldacci keeps the final outcome close to his chest, so that when all is revealed, the reader is left satisfied. And this is en essential attribute for all good thrillers. So, if you have a free night, and sitting by the fireside with your feet up and a good book in your hands, then \\"Hell's Corner\\" will make the night complete. Enjoy!
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I can watch those Twilight movies over and over and over. Unfortunately I've left my teen years way behind but don't we all want a small piece of romance and this saga offers just that. Addictive and I am in Team Edward :-)
B004289ZW0|2.0|Good GPS reception and easy iPad setup but bluetooth connection frequently fails  Unfortunately, the \\"finger slide\\" on-off control is miserable. You have to use the reset function frequently in order to turn the unit on or off. I have three units and all have the same problem. Emails to the company are ignored. Long term durability is questionable. Hopefully Garmin will have an iPad compatible device available before these units die.
0316286850|5.0|I've found this book quite informative that goes step by step explaining how to put make up on highlighting the best features and downplaying not so best. It is something to practice with but with time I am sure I will become much better at it.
B0021L8V0W|2.0|Back in the 80's, Kevin Costner made a movie called \\"No Way Out.\\"    It was about a man in the US military who was supposedly a Russian spy.  Sound familiar?    This seems like a remake of that movie, but with a female lead.    And they did NOT release this in a DVD + Blu-ray + Digital Copy combo pack.  That means spending $50+ to have this movie on DVD, Blu-ray and my iPad.   Ouch!!!!!!!     Not in my lifetime.    I'll wait a few weeks and buy a used DVD of this for under $10.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Overview:<br /><br />Managing freight trains is really an exercise in logistics. The objective is to get goods from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. Along the route there may be different switches and changeovers that may be encountered. Computers play a major role in the scheduling of trains in order to optimize the use of the rails. Over land, in terms of ton-miles hauled per unit of consumed energy, rail transport is more efficient than other means of transportation.<br /><br />This film is about a half-mile long freight train that was allowed to run away without its engineer, who was just a bit too careless and too slow. Initially it was thought that it was a 'coaster' - just rolling, but not under power, so they tried an initial interception down the track. But to their surprise, the train as long gone and now moving at a speed approaching 70 miles per hour. To make matters worse, the train has a huge amount of diesel fuel that it is carrying to keep it running, and if that is not bad enough, several of the cars contain explosive, toxic chemicals that are used to make glue.<br /><br />The Heroes:<br /><br />The guys who will take on the last effort ot stop this train are:<br /><br />- Frank (Denzil Washington) a veteran engineer with 18 years experience.<br />- Will (Chris Pine) a rookie now getting some hands-on training.<br /><br />There is a little animosity between the two initally, as Frank, sees himself as the old hand that is being phased out, and replaced by an inexperienced novice, with only theoretical training. However, when the crisis arises, they set aside their differences and rise to the challenge.<br /><br />The Experience:<br /><br />Watching this movie is a riveting experience. The momentum (mass x velocity) of the trains come across the screen big time. There are close passes and near misses that can make you sweat just watching them. There is a lot of stunt work especially at the ending. You can really get into this movie as the tension continues to build. The end is indeed quite rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.e rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.     Conclusion:     What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.
0596806027|4.0|This is a well written, fun to read book on what is new in HTML 5, why it's important and how it came into existence. It introduces new tags, reminded me of some old and forgotten and, in general, improved the quality of the HTML I write. It also presents Modernizr, a feature-detection framework (which is a much better idea than trying to parse the user-agent string). The book has an associated website where most of its text is available (albeit in a less couch-friendly format than the book/e-book and that does little to support the author) and both book and site have been important companions on my quest to relearn HTML and to get rid of any bad habits I may have developed in the past 15 years.
B003N7GATM|4.0|This is a good EP, but I wish there were more-- a full album. Trent's wife adds a feminine touch to his sound. This was a free download and was appreciated as such! Together with \\"The Social Network\\" this proves that Trent Reznor's abilities go far beyond NIN.
B002KKBVAQ|1.0|I didn't read the information carefully enough.  I had purchased Magformers for afterschool programs and mistakenly thought these panels were just that, with the magnets imbedded in the panels.  They are actually small magnetic balls and rods with panels.  The Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled similar products due to potential harm to children.  I would not let any child under 10 play with this item. See CPSC info about a similar product here. [...]     I plan on sending this back and purchasing Magformers - they have the magnets embedded.
B000IHSKSY|4.0|This is the second pair of these I own.  It might be best to buy a half size larger than your regular size to ensure a comfortable fit.  I don't recall my first pair needing to be broken in but these are my actual size and the right side is a bit too snug.  Otherwise, looks are impressive and they're very strong.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Brothers is certainly more produced than their earlier records but sounds just as fantastic.  On the first listen i was a little dissapointed by the slower songs but this is one record that gets better every time i hear it.  Havent put it down since June
B0012OVEJO|5.0|\\"What makes a band unique? For some it's merely the music, while others point out lyrics, live performances or the group's image. But whichever is your pick, know this - Crimson Glory has it all. Simply one of the most underrated and overlooked bands in the history of the progressive metal genre, Crimson Glory is like a hidden treasure waiting to be revealed by new generations of metal maniacs. Their stunning self-titled debut album to this day remains a strong example of skillfully composed and passionate music. Catchy guitar riffs, intense drumming, incredible vocals - you name it, they got it. Get ready for the experience of your life....<br /><br />Crimson Glory was formed in 1982 in Sarasota, Florida, back then going by the name of Beowulf. The three musicians who started the group were Jon Drenning (guitar), Ben Jackson (guitar) and Jeff Lords (bass). With the addition of Dana Burnell (drums) and Midnight (vocals) the formation changed its name to Crimson Glory and begun working on their own unique musical style. It took them four years to come up with the material which was soon released by Roadrunner and instantly received surprisingly good feedback from both critics and music fans. Surprisingly - because no one really expected such a powerful record from a young, debuting band. Nowadays compared to the likes of early Queensryche, Fates Warning and Fifth Angel, the album contained a thrilling mixture of glam and heavy metal - the songs stretched out from fast, heavy blows (\\"Mayday\\", \\"Angels Of War\\") to majestic masterpieces (\\"Valhalla\\", \\"Azrael\\") and beautiful ballads (\\"Heart Of Steel\\", \\"Lost Reflection\\"). Released in 1986, the album was truly groundbreaking for its time, and years later it can still leave the listener speechless. All tracks feature excellent guitar work by both Drenning and Jackson - violent riffs intertwine with brilliant solos throughout the entire album. Also Burnell's drumming and some of Lords' bass parts deserve applaud, but the real highlight of Crimson Glory is definitely Midnight's vocals. Compared to Rob Halford himself, Midnight proved to be one of the best singers in the history of metal music, able to easily switch between impressive clear vocals and incredibly high pitched shrieks. Songs such as \\"Mayday\\" and \\"Dragon Lady\\" are the best examples of Midnight's amazing vocal abilities.<br /><br />However, the songs featured a lot more than just solid vocal lines. The lyrics, usually concentrating on mysterious women or science fiction/astronomy themes, helped to establish a very strong mood of melancholy and sadness, in the same time losing nothing from its majestic form. The mystical atmosphere was strengthened by the band's live shows, during which all of Crimson Glory's members performed wearing characteristic silver masks such as the ones depicted in the album's inlay. With all these elements put together, no wonder their debut album became quite a success - it was a fresh breeze on the metal market and delivered a great dose of charismatic, melodic music.<br /><br />The follow up album, \\"Transcendence\\" (1988), expanded the ideas found in the debut and featured even more epic material, which helped Crimson Glory gather a loyal fellowship of fans, to whom they referred to as The Crimson Militia. Their next album, \\"Strange And Beautiful\\" (1991), was a big step forward for the band's music - the epic progressive metal stylistics were confronted with blues and hard rock elements. Although not all fans appreciated this combination, the album was still a success and proved to be a valuable part of Crimson Glory's discography. Unfortunately, after it's release the band broke up and it wasn't until 1999, when a new album saw the day of light. \\"Astronomica\\", recorded with a new singer Wade Black and ex-Savatage drummer Steve Wacholz, was a return to the epic progressive /power metal vibes present on the first two albums. Enthusiastically greeted by the fans, it remains the band's last offering todate.<br /><br />Crimson Glory have long ago carved their name in the history of metal, as their releases still dazzle fans all over the world. The band's self-titled debut proves their unique abilities to deliver fast, heavy and - most of all - passionate music. \\"Crimson Glory\\" remains one of the most fascinating albums of the 80's metal scene - if you haven't discovered it yet, this is your chance!have long ago carved their name in the history of metal, as their releases still dazzle fans all over the world.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|This series was a delightful surprise to me as I don't watch much of the TV series because of too much sex and violence.  The interactions of the characters are wonderful.  Castle's relationships with Becket, his daughter, his mother and the other two detectives are warm, subtle and entertaining.  Well worth the price for good entertainment.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|My daughter got me to watch the first three movies and then I agreed to let her buy Breaking Dawn to read to me. It's a book I just couldn't put down once I started reading it. It's an intense story.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|My kids barely understood what was being said which is sad because I think they miss the moral of the story, The second ghost was a little too much I watching his life thru the floor REALLY! I believe my daughter smacked her lips a few times before she got up and left, I must say the last ghost was a treat we were intrigued at that point we were like whats going to happen next and all the scenes before this was WASTE OF MY FAMILY TIME!! So in closing from the beginning of the last ghost to the credits was worth watching!!
