098478280X|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I've found to be incredibly useful and fun.  I'm not a software developer or a software engineer. I'm not a program manager or an SDET (whatever that is) and the closest I get to Java is in line at a Starbucks. In fact, I have little to no programming expertise whatsoever. But working for a company like Google, Apple, or Microsoft sure sounds fun.  So I ordered myself a copy of this book and with resource in hand, I was sure my complete lack of applicable skills wouldn't be a problem. Off I went...<br /><br />After a number of failed attempts at taking this book with me into interview rooms as a \\"reference\\" or \\"just a hard surface to take notes on\\" mixed in with outraged objections at my use of the whiteboards to draw stick figures and dinosaurs, I was beginning to lose hope.  I knew I had to take a different track.  Turns out that bludgeoning interviewers with a 508 page, 2 lb book wasn't a particularly good idea either.  Successfully managing a near escape from an angry mob of enraged programmers, I came to the realization that my dream was not meant to be. Broken-hearted, I grieved for a while and then bought a copy of \\"How to be a Helicopter Pilot with Absolutely No Training\\" and am very hopeful. But to this day I still keep this book around as a reminder of my adventures in coding.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played!! I cant wait to play angry birds space! I hope that's really awesome.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So I purchased this book because my niece said it was a good read.  Normally I would not read this type of book however the writer was able to keep you interested in the story, as well as opening up some doors deep in your conscience that may have been closed. Read all three books, enjoyed them, so did my co-workers.  We have had some interseting conversations.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This will go down as one of my most favorite movies.  I cannot compare this version to the previous.  They are both portrayed by different sort of people.  The acting in this version is superb and I recommend it to anyone single, looking to feel good all over.  Or to that housewife who is lonely, this kind of movie makes you feel so much better.<br /><br />  The digital copy is a huge bonus!
0307887960|5.0|This is the first time I feel in control of my weight gain and loss. This book educated me about the chemistry of my body and how it reacts to food and simple exercise. I'm losing weight, I'm never hungry, and I'm feeling more healthy.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|its a cool game to pass the time. my daughter loves making different thing. it teaches patience. I just wish a lot of the dishes wouldn't take so long to make.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I play this album everyday! It dislays the talents of dome of the best artists of today.  It also has a great mix of different music styles, smells like teen spirit is awesome! I love this album, get it. We are subjected to crap on the radio everyday, here is the solution.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|A very nice case if you don't need the flashy lights. Has a mobo cutout (for easy installation of a backplate for an air cooler such as the CM Hyper 212 EVO), great cable management and great fan placement (with 2 fans included - a 140mm exhaust on top, and a 120mm intake fan on the back). It has great air flow. Everything fits great, and I am very happy with this case. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone except someone that NEED a full tower case!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I am a fan of Baldacci. Some of his work is predictable. This one kept me up until the wee hours of the morning.
1600108512|5.0|Unlike many of my friends, I did not read \\"The Last Unicorn\\" as a child so I cannot approach this graphic novel with rose-colored nostalgia. I am happy to report, however, that this adaptation by Peter B. Gillis is a magical tale, even for a jaded adult like myself.<br /><br />This deceptively simple narrative of an immortal and emotionally isolated unicorn who suddenly seeks others of her kind is a compelling read. The unicorn suffers enslavement and enchantments during her quest, and the end as bittersweet as a Hans Christian Anderson tale.<br /><br />The illustrations bring delicate beauty to the story. Unskilled artists might have given in to the temptation of overwhelming the unicorn with sparkles and rainbows, but Renae de Liz and Ray Dillion both handle the situation with restraint and subtlety. They infused life into the varying landscapes and focused on the moods and facial expressions of all the characters.<br /><br />Like Frodo Baggins who saved the Shire for everyone but himself, the Last Unicorn grows and alters beyond recognition. On the surface she triumphs, but deep inside she's been wounded by her brush with mortality and human emotion. It's impossible not to be moved.<br /><br />In its latest form, \\"The Last Unicorn\\" will surely gain a whole new generation of fans -- and it will be well-deserved.<br /><br />(This review previously appeared in the San Francisco/Sacramento Book Reviews.)
B00756GKBA|5.0|This album is excellent.  It is truly amazing the 30 years(almost!) that Madonna has performed.  I would say the best songs on this album are: GGW, Love Spent, Some Girls, Give Me All your Love, Turn up the Radio, Superstar, and I'm a Sinner.  But all and all the whole album is solid.  Hooray for Madonna!!!!!

0783226063|3.0|Where to start with this movie?  The brilliant, but at times confusing sci-fi book series by Frank Herbert, on which this movie is based?  The equally brilliant, and idiosyncratic director, David Lynch?  The battle for supremacy between Lynch's theatrical cut of the film, and the recut-for-TV version upon which Lynch refused to bestow his name, leaving producers instead to credit the dreaded \\"Alan Smithee?\\"  This is a love-it or hate-it movie, as many other reviews have noted.  I felt some of both, so here goes.<br /><br />What I liked:  I will admit that part of my curiosity around this film was to answer the question, \\"is it even possible to make this book into a movie?\\"  The scenes and settings are so striking and original, the characters so unusual, and the plot so intricate and multi-layered, I tip my hat to Lynch simply for giving it a shot.  It's not possible to make this book into a film via literal scene-by-scene translation.  But I felt it was faithful to the book in all the ways that mattered.  BTW, musical score by the 70s/80s group Toto?  Affirmative (although the music feels somewhat dated at this point, I actually thought it was pretty good).<br /><br />What I didn't like:  Being an older film transfer, some of the quality issues are more apparent than in more recent films.  And I have to say I like Kyle MacLachlan as a general rule, but I thought he was wrong for this film, and not as convincing as Paul as some others might have been.  And Baron Harkonnen was just plain weird.<br /><br />But if you liked the book series, give it a shot.  . . . . but at least you won't be bored.
0985114606|5.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />Wow...read in under 2 days. I loved this book so much. Beside it being a super hot book, I love Gideon. He is such a complicated character.<br /><br />This is my first Sylvia Day book and while I know everyone is hyped up about the idea of \\"mommy porn\\" this isn't that! This is just good writing, solid characters and really sexy, steamy, sex.<br /><br />When these two damaged characters come together sparks fly and I mean that in a good way. Gideon and Eva are very into each other from the moment they literally bump into each other.<br /><br />I am very excited for book 2 of the \\"Crossfire\\" series and hope for it to be even better. While I was in love with Gideon, I often wanted to slam the book over Eva's head. She is intense and constantly needs reassurance. We have all been through terrible things but Eva allows it to define her in a way that tells me she needs more therapy than anyone I know.<br /><br />Gideon is often jumping through hoops to reassure her of his desire for her.<br /><br />Besides my despise for this needy woman, I truly loved the book. I would have sat and read it straight from cover to cover and in my very busy life that says a lot.<br /><br />The degree of their damage from their past is deep. They are both flawed but together they are learning to care about and trust others.<br /><br />Hopefully book 2 will give us  more of Gideon's prospective. He is a solid character who even with all his flaws knows exactly what he wants and what is good for others too.
1451648537|4.0|Should have counted the f-bombs.<br /><br />After this book (audio version) I was exhausted.  This author would have you thinking, apparently from his interviews with Steve Jobs, that you missed a majority of your life if you never went to a Bob Dylan concert.  This book is almost a tribute to Dylan due to the fact he was mentioned so many times.<br /><br />I admit not being an Apple fanboy (let the bad reviews pour in now).  I enjoyed the technical aspects of the numerous mini stories.  I enjoyed this book about the same as I would a Bill Gates biography.<br /><br />I will listen to it again in a couple of years but I have kids so it's headphones only due to the profanities and vulgarities.<br /><br />I do not regret my purchase but it will sit on the shelf a long time before it's touched again.<br /><br />This would be a great read for Steve Job fans and Apple fans alike.  For the rest of us, it is a good history book, in my not so humble opinion.  It touches on many, many technological advances so i give it it's due credit with 4 stars.
0345803485|1.0|There are so many great racy romance authors writing engaging stories with similar themes as FS, but this writing was such an elementary level, I had to put down in complete boredom.  MUCH better by Robin Schone and others in the erotic romance genre.  Am embarrassed that I got suckered into downloading on my K, but was curious as to all the crazy buzz.  Not worth time or $$$.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|excellent songs selection , the album that every biuka fan should have, love the cover, in every single way a fantastic buy
B00723NWJE|5.0|Some of my very favorite albums are those I didn't necessarily like the first time I listened to them.  My first listen was cursory, kind of in the background, and nothing particularly jumped out at me. I was doubtful I was going to like this album because it was clearly not the Norah Jones I have come to expect.  Second listen was cursory as well.  But this time I was hearing things anew.  Songs were getting my attention.  I kept listening, and soon this album was captivating me with it's haunting melancholy vibes.  This will be a stand out album for Norah.  For better or for worse.  Not everyone is going to like it.  But I think there is some genius going on with this album. But those expecting more of the same beware.  Expect something new and different and you won't be disappointed. It's her voice that I love.  And it's all here.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting book, easy to read but hard to let go.<br />For my personal taste i would do without the fashion details. otherwise great dystopian story

B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games. ya ya ya ya ya ya! awesome and fun. awesome and fun. awesome and fun. I like it
B00000I41J|5.0|Somehow I've managed to listen & play jazz, but missed out on this album. Cannonball steals the show. But just listen to who he had for backup: Miles Davis(tpt);Hank Jones on piano;Sam Jones on bass & the great Art Blakey (remember the jazz messengers?) on drums.<br /><br />One critic said that Miles trumpet sounded shrill & tinny, but I don't agree. I think the guy was just used to hearing him with a mute. You might like to get a CD called \\"muted Miles\\" but I have it & still don't agree. BTW there is on this Blue Note reissue a bonus tune called \\"Bandgoon\\" about 5 minutes long, the last cut. Everybody gets into the act here. Miles, Cannonball, Blakey, Hank on piano. The only one who doesn't solo is the bass player.<br /><br />As for the tunes, you'll recognize \\"Autumn Leaves\\" & \\"Love For Sale.\\" But improvisers just \\"play the changes\\" & Adderly does a beautiful ballad. Like the jazzers say, \\"Anyone can learn how to play fast, but it's the guys who can do a great ballad that separates the men from the boys.\\" I highly recommend this CD.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Normally I like my R&B singers with exceptional powerhouse voices like Beyonce or Jazmine Sullivan. While she has a good voice, Emeli's voice is not exceptional--and strangely, I don't care.<br /><br />Emeli's talent and skill as a true songwriter is front and center throughout the entire album. &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; is one of my favorite songs from probably at least the past five years. Emeli just has this real skill of pulling the listener into the song, so much so, that the little moments of her voice cracking or even going a key higher can serve as the climatic point of a song--without doing vocal gymnastics.<br /><br />I've found myself listening to this album over and over, and finding different songs that I really like each time which is my personal mark of a brilliant album. With much pop--it's immediately obvious if it has a catchy chorus etc...and you can tell whether or not it's rubbish within 30 seconds. With Emeli's music though, it takes really listening to both the words and music several times to really &#34;get it.&#34; My one criticism is that it sounds a little too polished at times for my taste, I wouldn't have minded if she just let loose with a Janis Joplin wail or had more raw breakdowns to some of the songs.<br /><br />Emeli won the Brit Critic's Choice award which have recently all gone to the who's who of the UK's top music exports aka Adele, Florence and the Machine & Ellie Goulding. While I don't think she's quite on say Adele's current &#34;21&#34; level yet, this album is certainly on par with Adele's debut &#34;19.&#34; This is simply a really solid album of emotional, dynamic music from an artist that I think will be doing even bigger and better things in the future.<br /><br />**Other song standouts for me are her other ballads &#34;Mountains&#34; and &#34;River.&#34;
B006OT03BM|1.0|Aliens attack earth, only the \\"gods chosen one\\" can save the world.<br />Been there done that, the jewcentric hollywood model is flagrantly racist. Especially when spielberg fires an actress for comparing the director to hitler.<br />It's as though hollywood and the holocaust industry have copyrighted hitler and maintain exclusive rights.<br /><br />Although to be fair, hollywood made several \\"black man savior\\" movies with will smith to prep people for Obamas reign. Prior to those movies Smith was relegated to doing the heavy lifting for goldblum in ID4.
0143119680|1.0|I think this book is horrible!  I couldn't get past chapter 5.  It's like a Harlequin romance written by a \\"scholar\\".  Go back to your history books and leave novels of urban fantasy to authors like Kim Harrison.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The excitement continues to the Hunger Games! I truly enjoyed every page. When I finished I immediately went right into the final book \\"Mockingjay\\".<br />I would highly recommend this book to all who have read \\"The Hunger Games\\".
0061537969|5.0|This was a beautiful story.  The story was about a very sweet dog and the family which he helped through life.  You will fall in love with the dog but the story is even more than that. It gave some life lessons woven through the story line, that added great depth to the significance of the story.  The story taught compassion, kindness, and life perspectives.  The writing flowed smoothly and was not overly heavy or distracting.  An easy read.  But I caution you to read when you have quiet time to do so.  I unexpectedly  cried my way through a few parts while sitting at Starbucks!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this trilogy. I'm so happy that my granddaughter,Madison, suggested I read \\"The Hunger Games\\". After reading it and then following up<br />with \\"Catching Fire\\" and the ending in \\"Mockingjay\\" was an exciting read. I hated to have the reading end but it ended the way I was hoping. Such a great story. I strongly suggest everyone to enjoy this series. I want to the movie on \\"The Hunger Games\\" and it made reading the last 2 books that much enjoyable.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I got this yesterday and already have like 6 games going. and its free I would've payed foe I anyways. it is so addocting.
B0081ELJ7U|5.0|Whoa, now that's what I call a finale.  Castle finales have always been fantastic and the writers always crank up the dial ten-fold in these times and \\"Always\\" was no exception.  Some major things happen here and I won't spoil it for you.  The acting is flawless, the story, clearly well-handled, is amazingly well-told and scripted, and the action scenes, while somewhat diminished by the other major plot movements, are still great to watch.<br /><br />Honestly, one of the best, if not the best, episodes of castle to date.  Watch it!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|People have already pointed this out but I think it's definitely worth repeating: this is so much better than the standard US box set. Unless you want all those extra \\"digital copy\\" and \\"dvd copy\\" discs, this is the way to go. Three blu-ray discs, simple packaging, plenty of special features.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book very much. So much so that I bought the next two in the trilogy. Even though the book is intended of young adults, the themes are very mature subjects. I hope the author writes more on the subject.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i have been playing oregon trail everyday since i got it. i have been able to enjoy this game without spending any money
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about this book while lurking on the Kindleboards, and spent weeks debating whether or not it was as good as people made it out to be. \\"Is it worth $5.99?\\" I asked myself. Money's tight right now; $5.99 buys a day's worth of food in my world. Could I justify this purchase?<br /><br />It was more than worth it. I've been venturing into dystopian science-fiction lately, and this was a fantastic read. I read it quickly, soaking in each page. It was definitely worth every cent and then some. I already purchased First Shift, and I'm looking forward to reading it as well.

B007GNMJYE|3.0|I came to Marina via a Burberry Prosum show soundtrack that featured the fabulous single \\"Numb.\\" From there it was a few clicks on Google and Amazon to her debut, which I found wickedly funny and arch. There are still touches of humor here (\\"Yeah I know I've got a big ego / I don't understand why it's such a big deal, though\\") but they pale in comparison to The Family Jewels (\\"Girls are not meant to fight dirty / Never look a day past thirty / Not gonna bend over and curtsy for you\\"). Yes, it's only pop, but I've seen too many acts sign over their signature sound and sensibility to Europop blandness in their sophomore efforts (Royksopp, anyone?), and with few exceptions that's what Marina has done here. Rather than let people come to her, she's rushing out to them, begging to be noticed and loved. Sorry, it don't work that way, honey.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Steven Soderbergh, considered quite the indie auteur with films like sex, lies and videotape, KAFKA, THE LIMEY and THE UNDERNEATH has also side-stepped that for the bright lights and big fun of studio filmmaking, and surprisingly, he's quite good at it. His work on the OCEAN's trilogy and TRAFFIC is proof of that. But then he'll go back and do films like FULL FRONTAL and THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIMENT. After that, he'll return to Hollywood and do the big cast outbreak disaster film CONTAGION. But this film here, HAYWIRE, is kind of in-between his Hollywood and his indie sensibilities. And in Soderbergh's pursuit to do a film in every type of genre, he has taken it upon himself to make a spy actioner with former American Gladiator and MMA fighter Gina Carano as his muse and his lead amongst a cast that boasts Ewan MacGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender.<br /><br />The plot is pretty rote: Mallory Kane (Carano) is former CIA-turned-independent-contractor. She has been double-crossed by her boss, Kenneth (MacGregor) and is on the run. She intends to return the favor in kind. Along the way, there are some pretty spectacular hand-to-hand fight sequences, some fun little chases and a plot twist or two. It's not the type of film you haven't seen before a hundred times, and there's the pity.<br /><br />Soderbergh and his occasional partner-in-crime screenwriter Lem Dobbs did a fantastic job subverting the crime drama a bit with THE LIMEY, and they could have used some of that same energy and smarts added to this film's interal workings. Instead, they decided to go with the same old, same old.<br /><br />Gina Carano is quite striking (in a number of ways) and is a talented actress. I hope that she's able to get more starring work, but I said the same thing about Zoe Bell from Tarantino's DEATH-PROOF and that hasn't happened yet. The rest of the ensemble don't really have a whole lot to do, but they all put themselves into it. Nothing feels particularly phoned in. MacGregor is a coward, Douglas is powerful, Tatum is conflicted, Fassbender is charming, Banderas is duplicitous, and Paxton is paternal. That's really all they needed for this film.<br /><br />The most important thing about HAYWIRE is that it's Soderbergh's chance to make a low-budget but globe-trotting actioner and also to bring someone like Carano into the cinema firmament, and it's fun and goofily serious, but it's nothing that will stay with you for a long time.it.

B006ISJQBC|1.0|I looked forward to seeing what William Monaghan could do on his own, away from the watchful eye of Martin Scorsese and a seriously overrated film like THE DEPARTED. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a good ear for dialogue. But where THE DEPARTED lacked in gravity, LONDON BOULEVARD lacks in just about everything.<br /><br />Basically we have an ex-con (Colin Farrell, looking like he needs some Grecian Formula), his crazed drug-addled sister (an amazingly bizarre Anna Friel), his idiot criminal friend (Ben Chaplin, channelling his inner coke-fiend), a damaged and agoraphopic film starlet (Keira Knightley, happy to finally be out of those horrible PIRATES films), her stoner caretaker (the brilliant David Thewlis), and a prerequisite volatile, vulgar and racist crime boss (Ray Winstone, phoning it in here).<br /><br />The main problem with this film is that it starts out strong with a not-entirely novel concept of an ex-con trying to stay as far away as possible from re-entering that life but keeps being pulled by two opposing forces, but it spirals completely out of control once Ray Winstone enters the picture. His character is less of a fleshed-out character and more of a gimmick. He exists solely to force the protagonist of our film to certain extremes. Character arcs as well as storylines are left incomplete. There seems to be a great deal of footage that was left on the cutting room floor that might elongate the runtime of the film, but it might help to complete and clear up some gaping holes. I will never say that I don't love a great film that makes you think or wonder after the credits start rolling, but the story has to make sense first.<br /><br />Aside from the solid work that Farrell, Knightley (who continues to impress after films like the brilliant NEVER LET ME GO and A DANGEROUS METHOD), and Thewlis do, this film is so far beyond making any kind of narrative sense, it's ridiculous. No character is given an opportunity to get fleshed out; the dialogue is pretty rote for this type of film; the direction by Monaghan seems inspired at first, but then becomes less of a homage to the 70's British crime films that apparently inspired it and more of a ripoff.<br /><br />There's almost no level that the film works at other than the three performers I mentioned already, and the ending is beyond moronic. It's very rare I find myself shouting at a film in incredulous anger, but LONDON BOULEVARD did it.; the dialogue is pretty rote for this type of film; the direction by Monaghan seems inspired at first, but then becomes less of a homage to the 70's British crime films that apparently inspired it and more of a ripoff.<br /><br />There's almost no level that the film works at other than the three performers I mentioned already, and the ending is beyond moronic.

1439152799|1.0|I do not write book reviews.  This is my first. Let me start by saying, I read alot of books.  Its part of my daily nutrition intake. I finish at least a book a week.  Anything from the classics or fantasy to romance.... I ate up Kate Morton's other works like rare gold filled chocolate... but this.  This I cannot finish.  I thought it was just me... why did I keep falling asleep with book in hand?  I came to see what others had to say... why this book is getting 5 star reviews baffles me.  You must have great resilience to sit through long drawn out page length descriptions of a simple dress or painting...  I understand using big words and lots of colorful adjectives, but lets not go too far. This is just over done none-sense.  I could cut out dozens of pages of pointless descriptions and it wouldn't effect the plot one bit.  The characters and story is intriguing.... but its over shadowed by too many words. Maybe I will be able to finish this book... if not, at least I'm getting a full nights sleep.

0062017926|4.0|I have read many of Rollins' Sigma books, but unfortunately not in order. So The Judas Strain is #3 in the series. I very much enjoyed the buildup to the Christmas Island reemerging of the strain and the subsequent involvement of Monk and Lisa and later the rest of the normal Sigma force. This has a lot of excitement and unexpected turns to keep you reading. The descriptions of the Judas Strain effects are graphic and squimish evoking. It's a very good read. This, however, is my first \\"Review\\" of a Rollins book because of two constantly very annoying recurring themes which could have been toned down considerably and I felt were distractions. (1) Poor Gray Pierce, he was literally a dishrag and hopelessly \\"useless\\" a great deal of the time because of his continuing worries and constant references to the plight of his parents. Tough it out Gray, this is a novel with a great plot and twist and turns and you know your parents will come out reasonably intact. I felt that this emphasis on his parents took some of the zing from the story. Every time I read he was thinking/talking/worrying/wondering about his parents, I said for Pete's sake here we go again. (Secondly) Lisa and Painter: Love is grand, but up to a point!  Here again the constant recollecting/referencing/worrying/flashbacking about each other got to be a little much and almost nauseating, but such is life and that could have been toned down. Otherwise, great evil characters plus the beautiful Seichan from the nefarious Guild, great plot, good story line; however, the story comes to a not so definitive conclusion as to leave the reader hanging and yearning for the next installment.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|is a great game. my kid loves it. there all simple gamed she is flying threw them. if you have kids you will love it.
0545265355|4.0|I'll give a pretty quick review.<br /><br />Book is easy to read, first book is best one by far. The last two did not have a quick enough pace for me. I would recommend this series to anyone. It's a tale about love, adventure, and politics.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a guilty pleasure of mine. I started reading it with the recommendation that if I could get through the first book, the other two were worth reading. I started reading \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and could not put it down. Yes, there are very explicit chapter in there, that at times, made me feel like a 10 year old reading my mom's romance novels. Even though I was reading it on my kindle, I still had to make sure no one was looking over my shoulder because it was so promiscuous and contained strong adult language. However, it kept me wanting more after I read it. If you can get pasted the 1st book (it has the worse raunchiness), then \\"50 Shades Darker\\" and \\"50 Shades Freed\\" are definitely worth the read! --Like I said, I loved this book too.<br /><br />This book sets the characters up for you to become emotionally involved. You want to hate Christian, but you learn to see why she loves him, and why she is so intrigued. I find myself relating to Ana a lot because her reactions are what my reactions would be... However, curiousity killed the cat, and Ana become curious of this lifestyle. Whether or not it agrees with her (you need to read and see how she reacts) she endevours in something that all women are curious about and you have to high-five her for at least trying.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Just like the name of this book, each page has you hungry for the next.  Your mind hurtles a million miles an hour trying to solve how each character can possibly come out alive because deep in your gut, you hunger desperately for a Disney ending.<br /> I haven't read something this engrossing since I was a child. The world that is created in this book has all the grit, grime and glamour of an alternate world, which makes the concepts even more compelling.
0345803485|4.0|I loved this book! I find myself in all of the swearing and overthinking that the charactor Ana does in the books. Literature snobs can easily tear this book apart but this is entertainment that makes a connection that most women can relate to. It's not perfect in that sense but it keeps the reader on their toes and you will find yourself not looking up from the the book and finishing it in no time at all. It's definitley not a vanilla read so be prepared for an open mind. It's a sexy read!!!!
0596809158|4.0|R Cookbook is a good book to have. It covers the bases well, and is organized in a logical method. The \\"Cookbook\\" formula works, for the most part.<br /><br />But if I lost it, would I purchase another copy? Probably not. Here's why:<br /><br />- Outside of base R (and some MASS), you're pretty much out of luck. Some other libraries are covered, but not extensively.<br />- R help is very good. ?[function] or ??\\"[topic]\\" get the job done 90% as well as this book, and much faster. (In fairness, this book is written in plain English, which can't always be said for R help)<br />- There's a ridiculous cornucopia of cookbook-esque material on the web, notably Stack Overflow.<br />- There's very little in the way of scripting, which is the bread and butter of R.<br /><br />My only strong advice would be that this is a supplement, and not a standalone learning method. But if you have another book on R and the price tag doesn't bother you, you could certainly do much worse.
B000002KOY|5.0|Take a look at the back cover photo - it says it all about the music and musicians on this record. This is an absolutely fantastic record.Danny Whitten was a great songwriter and singer and a tragic loss.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The prose is staccato and efficient, and the short sentences during action sequences contribute to The Innocent's fast pace. Engaging and enjoyable read.
B000002GJH|5.0|This album has stayed with me  since the early mid 90's and has always ranked top my ten for almost 20 years now.  I wonder why an album this GREAT only comes along every 5-10 years...Ok I am way exhausted while writing this but just got inspired to write it while I was listening to it.  Everyone really shines on this album. Matt Cameron is one of my favorite drummers.  Nobody plays like him and he graces this album throughout.  There is a beautiful misty melancholy that just permeates this album.  This is a cd I can easily recommend to just about anybody.  Blessings and cheers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Pretty good to have in a phone. i'm surprised at how much it can do. Looking for a similar version for my computer now.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I ordered this product a long time ago, but never opened the case. I finally opened it up and one of the discs was missing! I can't even return/exchange because it's been YEARS and I can't enjoy the movie.<br /><br />WEAKEST PURCHASE EVER!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love this game it is so much fun to play i love everything about it it amazing and awesome love it
0345803485|5.0|I thought I'd give this book a try. I read some not-so-great reviews, but I decided to try it anyway. I rarely read romance, sexual-type books, but this book has drawn me in! I really don't want to give much away in this review, but I am anxious to read the rest of this trilogy.
B002Q85A1I|5.0|I'm no music critic, certainly not in the genre of classical music.  As my moniker suggests, I'm more comfortable with the rock 'n roll generation.  But I grew up listening to classical music, particularly Tschaikovsky...on 78rpm.  I replaced them with 33-1/3 rpm vinyl in the 80s, which I'd hoped to dub to CD on a USB turntable.  But the condition of the vinyl was deplorable, despite the extreme care I've shown my vinyl over the years.  So I decided to go ahead and replace the vinyl with a quality rendition of both Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty.  I couldn't be more pleased with both the performance and the mastering of these two scores...much better than the Nutcracker I'd bought a few years ago.  Whether this is the \\"ultimate\\" rendition is for others to say.  As far as I'm concerned, these performances by Previn and the LSO are as good as it gets.  Perhaps I should complete the set with a better performance of the Nutcracker, as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ana and Christian are people in the process of finding out who they are, what the will accept and the development of a relationship that neither had had before. She has not had a boyfriend. He has not had a woman to truly love him. Yeah - there is BDSM to some degree but not as much as a number of other books. Do I like the flagrant use of the F-word? No but it is there to distinguish between making love and f'ing. This book is not as extreme on the graphic sex as other and I really looked at it as a story wherein two people are learning how to communicate between each other honestly and openly. Most of us hide our feelings and thoughts and do not express them with our partners - because we are so worried about wounding them, making them angry, not sure if they will understand.<br />Look how many email they exchange and the honesty in them, the questioning of them. Is this not something many of us to?<br />Read not for the titulating sex, get beyond it.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|G.  Martin is a great storyteller.  But he has some serious issues.  A little sex and gore is fine in a fantasy novel, Martin takes it to a whole other twisted level.  Incest, rape, blood, just twisted stuff.  A complete waste of a talented storyteller.  Ain't it a shame.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent book and an exciting series.  Be warned, however, that once you get to the games themselves, you will not be able to put the book down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had resisted reading this book because of the premis- kids killing eachother didn't sound like an excellent plot line to me. But then I saw the movie with my husband and it convinced me to try the books. Wow. These books were creative, suspenceful, and full of twists. After reading the first book you wonder if the others in the series can live up to the excitement... they do! And I couldn't get over how demented the arena was in the second book... I can't get over how much I loved these books.
0439023491|5.0|Enjoy the same great setting and tension but with the introduction of several new unique characters.  Witness the repercussion of consequences from not only the last Hunger Games but the war that started them all.
B0071MV540|5.0|It was a great adventure.  the casting was perfect and there was lots of action.  Would like to see more Eddie Murphy movies, especially of this caliber.
B001QWBM62|4.0|Great Recorder on so many levels.<br />I use it for external audio recording for DSLR video.<br />I was surprised by the quality of the built in stereo mics.<br />Dinged it one star because the display and menu system is terrible.<br />Not intuitive and too many steps to get into changing or checking some basic functions.<br />Something I will have to get used to.
B004ZN9W5M|2.0|Is it clear, crisp and does it yield a better Sound than the original CD? At times, yes but in some respects it doesn't have the warmth the original had. Especially on vocal tracks. I could be wrong but it sounds like the FX were rendered digitally and there is a cold edge to the delays and the verbs. The original vocal tracks had a warm trail in the reverb.<br />The drums are more \\"in your face\\" than the original. This works on many of the tracks but on tracks, like \\"Mother,\\" it gets a little in the way of the song.<br />The big problem I noticed, on several machines, was that the tracks did not flow seemlessly into each other like the should. When one track is ending and the next is supposed to seemlessly begin there is a strange duplication of the last second of the previous track. The start of the next track is the very ending of the previous track, so you hear this little bit of sound twice. In places where there is a bit of silence at the end of the previous track (ie:\\"goodbye blue sky\\") a delay is created because of this little bit of buffering. It throws the track program timing off.<br />To make certain it wasn't my machines, I threw the original Wall discs into the trays and played them. No problem. The programming error seems to be on the newly mastered CD's.<br />Here's another example; \\"Empty Spaces\\" into \\"Young Lust\\" : At the end of \\"Empty Spaces\\" he sings, \\"How should I complete the wallllll.....\\" and then the \\"Young Lust\\" track starts and we hear \\"walllllll\\" again.<br />It throws the whole joy of listening to these remastered tracks off. It is very distracting especially if you know this collection well.<br />Thankfully the old disc still plays.<br />Oh, how they should have completed the Wall... The right way.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I watched this movie expecting it to be good. I was not disappointed. The acting was good, the plot was well developed, the action scenes were fun, and as a whole a well rounded movie. It was a shame that for some reason this movie got no love in the box office. Maybe a poor release date, coinciding with Hunger Games could be the reason, poor critic reviews(which is garbage) either way I will be buying the blu-ray, and I would recommend this movie to any one out there looking for a bit of excitement and entertainment.
0345803485|1.0|There was so much hype about this book that I couldn't wait to read it. But, after reading about 75 pages, I had to laugh at the absurdity of this so called trilogy. First of all, the author must use the expression \\"inner goddess\\" at least 100 times in the first book. Not to mention the annoying phrase...\\"oh my.\\" I finished it because I thought it would get better and I wanted to see how it would end. It never got better but at least Ana could have orgasms every single time she had sex. And to think she was a 20 year old virgin who never even touched herself! I ended up reading the second book, Fifty Shades Darker, because I heard it was better than the first ridiculous book. Boy, was I wrong! Those stupid phrases,\\"inner goddess\\" amd \\"oh my\\" drove me nuts as  did the stupid sex scenes where she climaxed if Christian just put his hand on her breast. Give me a break! It was written in such a manner that it sounded like a teenager had written it instead of a middle aged woman. What a waste of my time. I will not be reading the last book in this stupid trilogy. I think E.L. James is an awful author and I'm sorry I wasted my money on her books.
B005NFW1JK|4.0|great series.  the characters are likeable in good and bad ways.  acting good,  effects good.  would recommend to others.  hope it stays a float
B005K17RU0|5.0|I don't know y people say it doesn't work, it does and it is awesome! u type in your location and it shows u the weather, in less than a minute!!!! it rocks!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!=)
B007H7XJD4|2.0|i am a film watcher, all types.  I really enjoy scifi and action.  this movie had action and the special effects were good, but the performaces and the story fell way short.  would not recommend to other except for the fight scenes and special effects, but there are movies will all available,  story, acting, action and special effect.  very dissappointing.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its just like farmville with spittle more teams here and there. if you like that game then you'll love this one
B0073PZIYI|3.0|on a scale of one to five.  five being best.  this was an ok 3,  pleasantly surprized and enjoyed it.  would recommend.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Dance with Dragons was better than Feast For Crows.<br /><br />Feast for Crows felt so mundane in parts, with boring perspectives from Dorne and the Iron Islands. Throughout I wanted to yell, \\"I DON'T CARE! GO BACK TO ARYA!\\" And so on.<br /><br />Dance with Dragons was a little bit better, but of course it's a parallel to Feast for Crows, which means some of the stories I DID like were left unresolved. We still have the boring Dorne stories, which it was all I could do to keep from clicking right on through.<br /><br />The stories of Jon Snow and Reek made it worth it. After Sam manipulated Jon into the position of Lord Commander, we see how political being in charge is and how Jon is constantly having to balance the needs of the wall with the entitlement from Stannis and his followers. We also see how precarious his position is and how isolated being commander has made him. Ned Stark's presence is felt here, though, even four books later, particularly where Janos Slynt is involved (favorite scene in the book!).<br /><br />The character of Reek is \\"new,\\" but not really. I'm trying to keep this review mostly spoiler free, so I won't say too much except that an earlier character has completely changed, to an almost \\"Gollum\\" effect.<br /><br />Notice I don't mention Dany or Tyrion. I felt like the instant Tyrion left Westeros, he became boring. Sure, he still has his wit, but he's truly too clever a character to be anywhere but a thorn in Cersei's side. I had fully expected to learn that he'd been behind Cersei's imprisonment the whole time or something like that. His development was disappointing.<br /><br />Dany had never been one of my favorite characters. Sure, her dragons are interesting, but she's always felt a bit \\"Mary Sue\\" to me--too idealogical. Here I felt she was one-note, where her stories bored me about as much as the Iron Island stories did.<br /><br />Obviously A Song of Ice and Fire has ballooned. Martin has wonderful, tittilating characters and greatplot twists. But it seems when he killed off several main characters in A Storm of Swords, he also killed off his reasons the stories were interesting.<br /><br />I'm hoping The Winds of Winter brings back Arya, as she is meant to be, that my worries about Jon are for naught, that Reek continues to make waves, that Sansa is eventually reunited with SOMEONE from her family, that Brienne doesn't kill Jaime, that Cersei dies a horrible death, that Dany becomes more interesting, that Tyrion goes back to Westeros with his head still on, that Sam becomes a Maester, and sheesh... so much more.<br /><br />I will read every book as it comes out, but I'm hoping the sixth book is of the caliber as Storm of Swords.
0345803485|1.0|This book was terrible. The writing, grammar, repetition, and story plot were all Terrible! I wish I had not wasted my money on the book. I couldn't even make myself finish the book. The story sounds like it was written by a child. And in the main character's thoughts, she refers to her \\"inner goddess\\" sounding like a child. There was several repetitions as well, if I read; \\"He cupped my chin\\", or \\"I flushed crimson\\", or \\"Oh My\\" one more time I was going to scream. This book is about a naive girl (woman) who falls for a seriously disturbed man who plainly states that he is so, and she wants him so badly. But after almost every account with him she is in tears. The whole novel was disturbing to me, and not because of the erotica, but because of the damaged relationship and this girl who is so \\"innocent\\" that she has no idea what is happening to her or what he is doing to her mentally and emotionally. This book should read as a warning to young college girls everywhere. Awful book, I will not be buying the other two and will discourage anyone who asks me about them as well.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Whew! This book is HOT! I picked it up after being recommended it by a 50 shades fan group. It is amazing. This book has some similarities to 50 shades but I liked it more than those books honestly.<br /><br />We start off with Eva a pretty well off college grad who just moved halfway across the country (Cali-NYC). She is staring a new job in a building called Crossfire and meets the amazing Gideon Cross.<br /><br />This book is amazing. Full of great sex scenes and some decent plot points. We really get to see how two people with a troubled past can work through their problems. I think this book was a wonderful build up to what could possibly come in the next book.<br /><br />This book was a lot of build up! If you aren't a big fan of build up in a novel then you may not like this book. I loved it. It's an amazing book and the scenes are lovely.<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you are looking for something similar to 50.

B004SEUIXS|5.0|Every few years or so, I remember to fall in love with Am&eacute;lie Poulain all over again. This movie, AMELIE, won't at all topsy-turvy the French's rep for artsyfartsy cinema, but never mind. AMELIE, which came out in 2001, is an imaginative bit of whimsy, an enchanting romantic comedy, a droll time at the movies, a quirky tutorial on contemporary Parisian living. It tells the story of a painfully shy Parisian girl who conquers her fears to perform good deeds on the sly. In service of this, she - Am&eacute;lie Poulain - becomes a travel agent... a poltergeist... a secret matchmaker... She becomes guardian angel to those around her. And, somewhere along the way, she stumbles onto her own slice of happiness. It's somehow all very French.<br /><br />It hinges on that expressive actress, Audrey Tautou, her gamine charms, her mischievous smile. She infuses such vivid life in Am&eacute;lie, a young woman whom as a child was conspired against by fate. Am&eacute;lie grew up isolated and introverted and unusual. As the narrative proper begins, we see her whiling away her days as a waitress in the quaint Parisian cafe, the Two Windmills. Am&eacute;lie's staid existence shatters one evening when she discovers in her apartment an old metal box nestled behind a wall tile. On a whim, she determines to locate the owner of the box and deliver unto him its contents of childhood memorabilia. This is the first link to a chain of remarkable circumstances.<br /><br />Am&eacute;lie's success with her modest mission inspires her to further acts of kindness. She brightens a blind man's day. She kindles a romance between a stalker and a frumpy hyponchondriac waitress. Because of her machinations, an abusive vegetable vendor gets his past-due comeuppance. She befriends a painter cursed with brittle bones. She sends a garden gnome off to see the world, and deploys the occasional postcard to its reclusive (and thoroughly baffled) owner. Yeah, Am&eacute;lie is having a fine time playing the covert benefactor, tinkering and meddling and orchestrating. But when she gets a chance for her own happy ending, will she be equally as bold? Am&eacute;lie Poulain, who is so shy. Qu'allez-vous faire?<br /><br />The first hour of the film really sells it for me, brimming as it does with captivating visual flights of fancy and offbeat, often sardonic humor. And I love that there's a whiff, just a whiff, of magic realism in play (a refined shout out to those who've enjoyed [[ASIN:B00005K3OT Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)]], [[ASIN:B0011N1WE8 Penelope]], [[ASIN:B003BZ58RQ L.A. Story]], [[ASIN:B0007QJ210 The Milagro Beanfield War]], etc.). Towering above all else in this film is Audrey Tautou, she of the waifish, puckish persuasion. There is simply something so irresistible about her. So, yeah, every few years I'm compelled to fall in love with her character, with Am&eacute;lie Poulain. AMELIE not only makes me like reading sub-titles, it makes me yearn to learn French just so I can relish them nuances one can only capture when absorbing the film's original language. And that globe-trotting garden gnome, it must have stories to tell, yeah?covert benefactor, tinkering and meddling and orchestrating.

0439023521|5.0|The story is quite original (even if they do say Battle Royale has practically the same plot). Is it a fast and easy reading. Based in a futuristic United States it gives a really harsh critic on nowadays society. I would say that message is the most important, putting away the fact that the story itself is really entertaining. It is quite violent, because (as I guess you already now) the Hunger Games are \\"games\\" in which tributes must kill each other, or, in another point of view, the survivor is the winner (so, there is some violent content not really recommended for kids who aren't 12 or so yet). The film is a quite good adaption, so if you watched it and liked it, you will absolutely love the book!
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I got this through KickStarter and gave it as a gift to my 7-year old daughter and her bike. Not only did she love it but loves riding with it and riding fast. I love it because of the safety precautions of having lights on her bike that's not just front and back, especially for evening rides here in NYC. And her friends love it because of all the cool designs.<br /><br />Now, the only problem is for her to actually see it. So there are moments when I need to ride her bike really fast so that she can see. Guess that's why I'll probably pick up another one for myself.<br /><br />The team who developed this are great people so please support them. They mentioned they'll be improving the instructions and listing of the patterns, so hopefully they got that all sorted. If not, that was the only negative that it was difficult to determine which pattern was set. That's why I just kept it on random.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|When this series came on television, I ignorantly overlooked it. I was so in tune with the ending and beginning of shows on HBO, Showtime, etc. Television shows weren't doing it for me. They were cliche and boring. A friend asked me if I watched \\"Breaking Bad\\", and I said no. He insisted that I watch it. I was 2 seasons behind, so I went and bought the first 2 seasons. Wow! I couldn't believe what I was missing. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue..absolutely incredible.<br /><br />I can't wait for this to be released so I can watch Mr. White and his counterpart handle their business....
0345803485|1.0|As a longtime reader of erotica, I was eager to see what all the hype was about.  Finally, a mainstream novel that addressed the \\"forbidden\\" practices of bondage, explored in a contemporary setting with contemporary characters.  What I read was a badly written, boring, underdeveloped waste of Kindle battery.  The book focused on the experience from one character's point of view, the female submissive, who is naive with poor self-esteem and little to no self-respect.  I derive these descriptors from her interactions with all of the other characters except Christian Grey.  Somehow, there, she grows a spine...sort of.  She is short on vocabulary so I got tired of reading about the way his pants fell from his hips or how \\"hot\\" he was.  Her feelings beyond confusion had as much depth as an email.  I could buy that she would be easily impressed with an abundance of personal resources and attention from a wealthy man at the expense of her identity.  This girl does not have the sense to realize she is actually in charge of the relationship...even after he tells her.  The irony of the submissive-has-the-ultimate-control is the key to a lot of the psychology behind making the relationship believable, never mind interesting;  if there were any sort of arc to the Anastasia character, the reader should be able to sense progress towards this idea or an increasing level of confusion to be explored; how the relationship changes how she feels towards what he wants, what she wants, & how she handles his physical demands.  What we get instead is some deer-in-the-headlights, barely-out-of-college girl who has made it through 4 years of undergrad without so much as a sip of hard liquor, let alone a kiss.  What's unbelievable is not the sexual acts described in the book, but everything else in it.  No insight, no imagination, no exploration.  You can find the same acts described in the same level of detail by characters who have a lot more to say about the situation in most other erotica: The Story of O, the Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty trilogy, Anais Nin's Delta of Venus.  Seriously, this book is like Sweet Valley High for the S&M set.  I want this thing off my Kindle.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Great product and value!I would recommend this purchase to iPhone users.<br />The product is table and remains on my boom box.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made in the horror genre. I rate it in my top ten films of all time. The film is like a horror film with an opulent base. The colors are beautiful, unlike any other Italian or any countries horror film in history. Argento has a lot of great giallo and horror films, but this to me is his masterpiece. The film is about a young American female that travels to Germany to study at the famous Tanz Academy. She quickly finds out after a slew of brutal murders that the school is a front for a coven of witches. If you are a horror film fan or just like any genre film this one is a viewing necessity. If you enjoy it the film is a first in a trilogy about the three mothers. The second part is titled Inferno and the third is The Mother Of Tears. Happy chills and thrills
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its awesome. i get to build practically my own virtual world. very addicting and fun i would reccomend this  game to people of all eges
B007R41E8O|4.0|I enjoyed the game. I wish it had been more challenging in some areas, and I didn't like having items left in my satchel at the end of the game.  Overall though, quite a good time.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Yes it was slow in the beginning because of all the details and info but when it picked up it was hard to put down.
B004QHR5GA|4.0|The songs are a lot slower than what you would normally expect from Arctic Monkeys but they are really sweet and fun. They fit with the movie very well (since they are also in the movie). They grow on you more than anything. Arctic Monkey fans may be disappointed if they expect Teddy Picker or Crying Lightening.
B007DJUO8O|4.0|Just didn't like it much to begin with. Way too much Wilson and not enough Akerfelt. Oh his guitaring absolutely shines throughout, but hardly any vocal except for Drag Ropes. Definitely not what I was expecting. But it grew on me!

1423113454|4.0|This book are about a brother and sister teaming up to save the world. The author of this book is Rick Riordan who is one of my favorite authors. Most of the book takes place in the U.S., but some of it takes place somewhere else in the world. The two main characters are Carter and Sadie Kane. Carter is like a walking wikipedia. (as Sadie tells it) He is a genius at ancient Egyptian stuff. Sadie is a normal British girl. When their mom dad when they were little, they were split up and only get to see each other twice every year. When their dad releases five Egyptian gods, they must work together for the first time. They must destroy the Red Pyramid and save the world.<br /><br />The big idea of this book is teamwork. If you work together and put your differences aside, you can accomplish anything. Carter and Sadie both learn that in the end. They may not see eye to eye on everything, but they start to develop a close relationship.<br /><br />I give this book a 4 out of a 5 star rating. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the other ones in the series. I think it was a really great book but it wasn't my favorite. There were parts that were really slow. Other parts were really fast and action-packed. This was a really great book and I can't wait to read the other books in the series.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|I really like Amazon's cloud music drive. I've uploaded all of my music to it - currently just under 16K songs - and I buy all my music from Amazon. So I should really love this app, right? No. First off, with the amount of music I have, I think in terms of genres. I don't think \\"I want to hear artist XYZ today\\", I think \\"I'm in the mood for...\\" and pick a genre, then pick an album or artist from that genre. The fact that Amazon doesn't allow me to select music by genre on this app is absolutely baffling. Please Amazon, add this feature. It's PAINFUL not to have it.<br /><br />Secondly, as someone who changes phones often (typically using overseas models) and lives in the USA, it's hugely frustrating that Amazon is so fiercely geographically fixated on only allowing the \\"right\\" version of this app on your phone, then logging you into Amazon.co.uk where none of your music exists. Yes, I'm an edge case, but come on Amazon - why do you have to cause me so much frustration? Just let me log into my account and let me play my music.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Buying this book was an experiment which TOTALLY EXCEEDED all my expectations.<br /><br />Having finished it just 5 minutes ago my mood is similar to finishing reading of Clarke's [[ASIN:B005XBUEWA Rama: The Omnibus]] or Niven's [[ASIN:B000054595 Ringworld]]: \\"Finally something completely nontraditional.\\" Plus I've got nice warm feeling of happy ending :-)<br /><br />Speaking of [[ASIN:B000054595 Ringworld]] - I think this book can bring up similar discussions like:<br />- \\"Is it technically possible to build and sustain such silo?\\"<br />- \\"How large such silo would be?\\"<br />- \\"What about natural resources? Silo assumes resources are within reach 'downwards'.\\"<br />- \\"How large is the silo's population size?\\"<br />- \\"What would happen if an infection would start spreading in such enclosed environment? Or, how to prevent it?\\"<br />etc.<br /><br />Going to buy EVERYTHING Hugh wrote :-)<br /><br />Hugh, thanks for this book!

B000VZBCWE|5.0|I decided to purchase the Blu-ray DVD after viewing this concert via Netflix streaming ( sorry Amazon )<br />I worked in the music biz for 20+ years and if for no other reason I totally recommend this so people can see what incredibly talented, classically trained musicians can do without the whole dog and pony show so common in today's \\"concerts\\"<br />Truly talented and skilled musicians don't need all the costumes, dancers, lasers, fireworks and other hoo-ha to put on a mind blowing show.<br />The quality is amazing considering how long ago this was filmed and it's such a pity it's the only Queen concert that was filmed in its entirety.<br />Freddie's talent comes through shining like the star he was...along with the rest of the band. But I mention Freddie because this makes me miss him that much more and one can only wonder what he could have achieved had his life not been cut short.<br />Some mention that the band doesn't seem to be totally \\"into it\\" and at the very beginning I agree...but only because the audience seemed so la-di-da. I don't know if it's because of the time period...heck back then I would have been rocking out but it doesn't take long before they get the clue.<br />Once the audience starts giving the love back to the band...this show takes off!<br />To those who grouse that the band was at their peak prior to this concert...show me and I'll gladly buy that DVD, too.<br />Otherwise...shut up and let true Queen and rock fans enjoy!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Hi, Everyone,<br /><br />I guess I'm a little slow catching up with Alias, but now that I've watched through Season 4, I highly recommend it.  It is entertaining, sometimes gripping, and always engrossing.  Although the violence is not graphic, I wouldn't have my children watch it.<br /><br />Have a good day,
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I find that Janet Evanovich is a intertaining writer.  Her Stephanie Plum books are great.  You never know what kind of trouble Stephanie is going to get into and her grandmother is a real hoot.  I have read 11 of the books in this series and am currently reading the 12th.  You really should read these books in order so that you know who all the people are and how they fit into Stephanie's life.

0312330537|5.0|One of the most signifcant pieces of writing that I have ever read. It will stay with me in my heart forever. Simply put: A must read.<br />A magnificent, miraculous work of art.<br />I have always wanted to go to India, and now, after reading this book, I have such a better feel for the place and the experience of living there.<br />The detail and the lessons learned are extraordinary. BRAVO!
0812550757|5.0|I read [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] a couple of years ago and had a friend convince me to finish the Ender Quartet. Glad that I decided to it, Speaker for the Dead is a compelling read, full of really big ideas and larger than life characters. I have only read a handful of science fiction books in my life, but this and Ender's Game compares with the best of fiction that I have read in any genre.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about this book is Card's creation of another species. The \\"piggies\\" are far removed from homosapiens, but are human all the same. The interactions of persons with the piggies are interesting and thought-provoking. One of Card's gifts is that his books contain really big ideas. Both this novel and Ender's Game would be a blast to read as a group and debate along the way. Many ideas about leadership, citizenship, humanity, anthropology, and much more are covered.<br /><br />Pick up this book and read it. Better yet, pick up the whole series - [[ASIN:0765362430 The Ender Quartet Box Set: Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind]]. Highly Recommended.

0439023513|3.0|At some point during Star Wars, Luke Skywalker's story evolves from his individual quest and struggle to being part of the Revolution as he dons a pilot's uniform and joins a squadron of star fighters battling The Empire.  It works.<br /><br />In Mocking Jay, Katniss Everdeen battles not in an Arena for her individual life, but joins the Rebel Army in District 13, first as a rally-symbol (the Mockingjay) and later as infantry when the rebels make their final assault on the Capital of Panem.  It doesn't work as well.<br /><br />The author was better at portraying the individual combat in the Arenas in the first two books than she was at fitting Katniss into a larger enterprise.  I thought the battle scenes were not as clear in my mind in this book as the very engrossing pictures she painted of the individual contest zones in Books 1 and 2.  The Rebel headquarters seemed awfully small, as did the population, for it to be successful in battling President Snow's army and rallying the other districts to an uprising.  It just didn't work as well for me.<br /><br />Not that this book isn't interesting and worth the time.  If you enjoyed Books 1 and 2, this is fairly enjoyable and carries forward the themes of what freedom means as well as the relationship between the individual and the state.  The love triangle is also brought to a conclusion and loose ends are tied up and resolved.  Readers are introduced to a heretofore unknown District 13 population that has checkmated the Capital since the revolt seventy years before.  Hidden from the rest of the country, Katniss' rebelliousness and connection with the oppressed citizens of Panem as a result of her success in the Hunger Games sparks an uprising that allows the District 13 forces to literally come out of their holes and fan the flames of a budding uprising.<br /><br />Katniss is largely a spectator to that process in the first part of the book.  Anointed the Mockingjay, she is used as a propaganda symbol to rally rebels to the cause.  She continues to struggle with Gale and Peeta and what each means to her as well as her place in her new world for most of this book.<br /><br />While the book is entertaining in parts, there is much less action (save for the final chapters) and more pondering than in the first two parts of the series.  Still, the author does successfully broaden the themes that span her first two efforts and conclude the story with surprises and plot turns that do make it overall a satisfying experience.to the cause.

1609611543|1.0|I found the first part of the book about the changes in modern wheat intriguing. I was interested in trying to eliminate wheat from my diet to see the results. But then he advised to avoid most other carbs as well. The rest of it was like just about every other low carb diet book I have ever read. A waste of ten bucks(I bought it for Kindle). I am very disappointed.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|There isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this classic movie. It is not only head and shoulders above most other horror films, but it ranks as one of the best movies of the 1970s. Perhaps inevitably it helped to spawn a genre of slasher films, sequels and remakes, not a single one of which comes anywhere close - in terms of imagination, characterization, direction or acting - to the power of the original. Despite its reputation, teenagers seeing this for the first time may even be surprised at the lack of gore, and at the restraint shown by John Carpenter in telling this simple but highly effective horror tale. A masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween fully deserves the Blu-ray treatment, and diehard fans will be hugely impressed by the picture quality. Extras include:<br />Audio Commentary with Writer/ Director John Carpenter, Actress Jamie Lee Curtis and Producer Debra Hill<br />Fast Film Facts<br />Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest Featurette<br />Trailer<br />TV Spots<br />Radio Spots<br /><br />All of these, to the best of my knowledge, have been included in previous packages. The audio commentary is an incredible listen for anyone who loves this film. But the main reason for me buying this version was for the absolutely stunning picture quality. I have watched Halloween (1978) many, many times before, and I love the clarity of this version.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|MIB is a lot of fun to watch. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith made a pretty good team. Lots of action. Fun sifi flick.
B00466HN6S|4.0|I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I wasn't sure based on the previews, but I like computer animation, and the characters were cute, so I decided to give it a shot. I was immediately drawn in by the beautiful scenes of the candy factory and wanted to eat my favorite - jelly beans - and lots of other candies. That went away later when they decided to cleverly make the Easter Bunny poop jelly beans. Nasty.<br /><br />I think it was a shame that they informed us from the opening scenes that Fred O'Hare was going to become the first human Easter Bunny. Kind of messed up the suspense a bit, didn't it? And why were they so opposed to there being an Easter Chick but not an Easter Human? Oh well. A lot of the movie was really funny and the interaction between Fred and the animated characters was excellent. It is also nice to have an Easter movie. I have so many Christmas movies.<br /><br />One gripe about the DVD format. I rented this from Redbox and upon trying to view the special features I got one of these messages: \\"This DVD is intended for rental only. Please purchase the DVD for the complete viewing experience.\\" Considering Redbox turns around and sells their DVDs when they are done renting them, I thought that was kind of rude.

0061928356|2.0|This book conceptually is original and there is a good story to tell.  However as other reviewers who have given it one and two star reviews have pointed out, the writing is just too elementary.  Her style is also not unique, she uses the same generic and superficial story telling as several other novice Indian American writers, who are more caught up in conveying \\"upper class\\" vanity rather than taking you into the thinking and raw emotions of their protagonists.  Gowda seems to go out of her way to highlight how academic and wealthy the US protagonists are, instead of delving into the emotional toll of what trying to have a baby is taking on all of them as individuals and as a family.  I tried to keep reading and hoped the book would change, but couldn't after about 40 pages, I just got so annoyed with the shallowness of the book, and frankly couldn't stand the US characters.  The author also includes a lot of pointless descriptions that really add nothing to the novel.  For example there's a chapter where Somer goes to her husband, Kris's (short for Krishnan) hospital, to share big news with him.  As she's waiting for him, she sees him walk down the corridor with I believe an attendee who reports to him.  I don't have the book on me anymore to quote her description (I returned it), but basically she talks about how he appears unhappy and seems to be scolding the attendee.  Why is that relevant?  If she's trying to depict that Kris has authority then she should just flat out connote that, rather than spend sentences on nonsense of him berating an underling.  I am an Indian American and like to read novels by authors who I share a similar background with and support them in Literature, but as much as I wanted to like Secret Daughter, I just could not get enthusiastic about it.  As much as I wanted to rally behind the book, Gowda just did not do the story justice.  Better writing and more character depth can be found in books by Rohinton Mistry (author of \\"A Fine Balance\\") and Chitra Banerjee Divakurani (author of short stories \\"Arranged Marriage\\" and \\"The Unknown Errors of Our Lives\\"), they are more seasoned writers and know how to dig deeper into what the character is thinking and feeling, and translate those emotions better to you, the reader.

The one touch movement of cards is really nice, just tap the screen and the card goes where it is supposed to go or even a row of cards will move with a tap.  I really Love It!!!!
145470246X|5.0|Sabine is a genius. This book is a must have for all beaders. I fell in love with it and it hasnt left my desk in the past week. Her designs are unique, beautiful and so wonderfully engineered. The colorways are impeccable and I keep admiring how elegantly the designs have been constructed. Highly recommended if you like beading!
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss does an excellent job in this book.  It is a book that will require you to think, and do some homework on the concepts it introduces to appreciate it fully. I put this book in my pile of books to digest, and read again in a year or two. I quite literally stopped playing Battlefield 3, reading my magazine subscriptions, and work on my thesis until I had finished it.  Fascinating. Thank you Mr. Krauss! It is also worthwhile to view his lecture on this topic available on youtube.

0061537969|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this book as I am neither a dog nor auto racing lover, but I LOVED this.  Enzo is a dog with a human mind who goes through life supporting and unconditionally loving his owner, who wants to be a race car driver. Didn't like the chapters (though short) about racing, but the rest of the novel made up for it -- especially a truly masterful ending that brought tears to my eyes.
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|Hi, it hasn't arrived yet. I've ordered it a while ago, it says it's been shipped but I haven't received it yet. Thanks
0345803485|2.0|\\"I rolled my eyes at myself.\\" Really?<br /><br />I have no idea how this book became a bestseller... other than today's decaying education has dumbed it down to reading solely about self-deprecating females falling in love with the first sharply-dressed man they plant their eyes on. Whatever happened to reading about strong female protagonists like Mattie Ross (True Grit), Jane Eyre, Charley Parkhurst (The Whip), Lisbeth Salander (The Millenium Trilogy), etc...? Books used to mean something once upon a time.<br /><br />I seriously could not get past the first chapter, and don't really know how I (or anyone) could go on for two more books. It's disappointingly written, and frankly an insult to many talented \\"British authors\\" the main character claims to like so much. If you liked Twilight, you'll probably like this... and that's really all I have to say about that.
B000063UR1|5.0|I loved this movie since it came out in 1971, when I was a teenager and fanatical \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\" fan, so it remains a sentimental favorite.  The best parts, of course, are the drones: Huey, Dewey and (dear departed) Louie.  When I watch it now, I'm only slightly disturbed by poorly thought out plot elements... like Freeman Lowell's prolonged puzzlement over the cause of his plants' mass die-off, only to discover in a moment of satori that he's too far away from the sun, so the plants aren't getting enough light.  Ahem.  Isn't he supposed to be a botanist?  Anyway, despite that, I love it still.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|season 4 is no disappointment for anyone that has followed SOA since the beginning. i have all previous collections and will own this one once it is released.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|You won't be disappointed in this book.  It is absolutely spellbinding.  Archer is his usual genius.<br /><br />This book was written in 1986, long before Kindles.  So apparently what Hodder and Stoughton did was simply do a scan of the type.  Then they emailed the digital format, utterly untouched and unread, to Amazon. And it really shows.<br /><br />Barely five or 10 pages go by before you notice the next typo or word substitution. These scanners are much improved but just not perfect.<br /><br />Most annoying are the missing page breaks.  One paragraph you are in London with Adam and the very next paragraph you suddenly realize you are in Moscow with Alex. Clearly there was meant to be a couple lines separation.  But it just isn't there.<br /><br />But, I  want to know why I have to pay $7.99 -- the same price as the proofread paper version? If there are no standards for Kindle materials, there at least ought to be a discount.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it!!  works great on my kindle fire. very fast and great reaction time. I would highly recommend it.
B006OW817C|4.0|I am just coming out of a concert in which Staier played the diabelli variations. It was absolutely perfect, imaginative, played at the correct tempo, full of imagination, poetry, power  and wit. The basses were beautiful and did not crush the higher notes. Listening to the record just after the concert raised questions such as : why so much echo (as if it was recorded in a church), why so little color, why so little contrast, why so much less than the real sound ?
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Worked perfect for my school project. Great price and did the job. No complaints! It also fits a variety of phones so its not only for the iPhone which is a plus.
B007EC6FIS|4.0|I was holding my breath waiting for this album.  I was really hoping for the Hopes and Fears Keane to return and they have.  I've listed to this disc three times and I already have songs stuck in my head.  The first listen was OK.  I was critical of the lyrics as they repeat the same theme.  But the second and third listens were convincing:  The album is good.  Whew!<br /><br />There are, of course, good songs and better songs.  Nothing that jumps out at me yet as a masterpiece.  I was hoping for another Hamburg Song, Try Again or Love is the End.  I think Tom just shines on those.  But it is a solid collection of interesting, catchy songs that should not disappoint any Keane fans.  I think H&F remains their only truly flawless work, but do not hesitate to grab this one.  You'll like it, I promise.
0345803485|5.0|I have to admit this book took me by surprised. But I have been become a huge fan. I now have all my friends and co-workers reading the book and many of them have already past me and have started book three. Buy the whole series because by the end of Book 1 if you don't have Book II to pick up immediately you will leave your house and go to the store to buy it. This series of books has been the best indulgent for me!!!
0060005696|4.0|One would think that having more choices would be a good thing.  It would, but up to a limit, or so says Barry Schwartz.  Schwartz backs this claim up with studies, some of which have been related in other recent and similar works by other authors.  The classic example here has become the case of the sample jams in a restaurant, where people are more likely to buy when there are fewer choices.  There are many reasons for this, one being the feeling of future regret, which is amplified when there are more choices, so that the number of potential errors in choice increases, thereby resulting in a sort of paralysis.  Schwartz gives other examples like these throughout the book about psychological states and other phenomena that affect how we feel about choices.  He spends some time talking about maximizers, or people who want only the best.  These folks are victimized even more in a world of plenty because they will never be satisfied with whatever they choose.  Schwartz offers some prescriptions: for example, people should seek to become \\"satisficers\\", that is to choose what is good enough.  Also, expectations should be lowered, and choosers should account for adaptation when they think about the effects of their choices.  These all seem like good advice in a world where choice can become overwhelming.  Anyway, I read this book instead of a hot romance novel, now I don't feel so good about my choice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an amazing book and a must read for everyone! The one thing i didnt like was what Peeta said to Caesar Flickerman by the interview about Katniss. I especially like how its written in the present tense. The second and third books are equally amazigng. I read all 3 in less than 24 hours, I just could not put it down.
B001NLKT60|1.0|I couldn't get past 12% on my Kindle.<br /><br />I usually read mostly fantasy (which means I am used to descriptions and lengthy reading), but I enjoyed the movie from the first book and decided to try this one as a book. And what happened during those 12%? Laundry-list type descriptions, about the Powerbook, about the zip file she downloads for 370kb or 390kb, the useless description of what she buys at the grocery store, the trip to Ikea with the name of every item she buys, etc. etc. Mostly page after page of filler rather than an actual story. I put the book down, annoyed by the Ikea description, then picked it back up the next evening, read a few lines and decided I'd rather sleep than continue reading the Ikea catalog.<br /><br />This was terribly in need of some serious editing and cutting, and it seems to be a lot better suited to a movie, where some of those details can be put in casually without boring the reader page after page. It just feels like complete amateur writing to me.<br /><br />Just cannot read this, a waste of $10.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|George Martin told half the story with half the characters in the 4th book (A Feast For Crows) and tells the other side in book 5 (A Dance for Dragons).  Ok some of the characters drive me nuts and their actions as well but I like to keep up with my favorites (the Imp and Lord Commander).  In the 6th book I understand starts with 2 large scale battles.

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book. I am currently hooked on 50 Shades and have read all three book at least 3 times. This story offered the adult theme and passion that was in 50 Shades but also gave the reader some mystery as we try to guess at what is going on with the back stories of Cross and Eva. I am really looking forward to the second book to see where it is going. The end of the story does not seem to set up and new plot lines for book 2. If you enjoyed the raw sex and language on 50 Shades and the passion and sometimes childish behavior of Beautiful Disaster then you should enjoy this book.

B002VECLVO|4.0|This bittersweet tale seemed like a boring topic to me so I never checked it out until it dropped into my lap and I heard Colin Firth was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards. Firth plays a British professor teaching at a university down in Los Angeles in 1962. He was married to a woman (played by Julianne Moore) for several years but he came to realize he was gay and so takes up a long term lover and loses him  (that's in the log line so that can't be a spoiler, people). The rest of this tale focuses on him coming to terms with the death of his lover and seeking clarity in a confusing world as a man's whose sexual tastes are seen as perverted (a bad word in the 60s unlike now in which opinions are mixed). Firth does a close to brilliant job as a philosophically depressed intellectual who still defaults to common emotions we all understand. The cinematic focuses are notable. Viewers who have issue with homosexuality should clearly skip this picture.<br /><br />This was Tom Ford's directorial debut and he financed the $7M budget which made a bit over $24M at the Box Office. Firth was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Gloves, won the BAFTA for the same role and he and the film were nominated for several lesser known awards. Based on a novel of the same title by Christopher Isherwood.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CINEMATAGROPHY: B plus to A minus; THEMES: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012; OVERALL GRADE:<br />B to B plus.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): George: Let's leave the Jews out of this just for a moment. Let's think of another minority. One that... One that can go unnoticed if it needs to. There are all sorts of minorities, blondes for example... Or people with freckles. But a minority is only thought of as one when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority. A real threat or an imagined one. And therein lies the fear. If the minority is somehow invisible and the fear is much greater. That fear is why the minority is persecuted. So, you see there always is a cause. The cause is fear. Minorities are just people. People like us.  ////// Carlos: No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something. George: I think you picked me up. This is kind of a serious day for me. Carlos: Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you? George: I'm just trying to get over an old love I guess. Carlos: My mother says that lovers are like buses. You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.  ////// George: [last lines; voiceover] A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh. I can never make these moments last. I cling to them, but like everything, they fade. I have lived my life on these moments. They pull me back to the present, and I realize that everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.  //// George: It takes time in the morning for me to become George, time to adjust to what is expected of George and how he is to behave. By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish on the now slightly stiff but quite perfect George I know fully what part I'm suppose to play.  ///// Jennifer Strunk: Would you like to meet Charlton Heston? He's our scorpion. Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it. Daddy says it's like a Coliseum. Daddy says he wants to throw you into the Coliseum. George: No kidding. Why? Jennifer Strunk: Well, he says you're light in your loafers. But you're not even wearing any loafers.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|Some professional reviewers have bashed Keane for playing it safe with the piano sound reminiscent of Hopes and Fears. But the similarities are pretty superficial. Strangeland is much more personal, and has elements of Perfect Symmetry as well as Hopes and Fears.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Bend and Break,\\" \\"Everyone's Changing,\\" and \\"This is the Last Time\\" were about changing relationships. They had widescreen epic melodies, and we all remember these as among Keane's best songs. The lyrics were general and could apply to anyone: \\"When you forget your name/ When all faces look the same...\\"<br /><br />Basically speaking, Keane writes songs about relationships and the difficulties of life and upbeat or encouraging songs, or songs that offer advice. I've always preferred the more personal ones, and Strangeland has some of both. Overall, though, it has many breakup songs that seem to be about specific situations from Tim Rice-Oxley's life: the sad \\"Watch Yourself Go\\" (wishing a lover well while saying goodbye); \\"Silenced By the Night\\" (predicting a new stage in a benighted relationship - lots of light/dark imagery in the album); or \\"Disconnected\\" (describing estrangement). These are far more specific than the anthemic songs about alienation and fear in \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" They're more grown up.<br /><br />The piano sound has changed too. \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\" and \\"Neon River\\" have tasteful synthesizer touches (but nothing like the overwhelming synth on Perfect Symmetry). Tim pounded the keys like Elton John in the early stuff; along with Richard's rock-style drumming, this gave the songs real kick. The playing is more complex here - and functions more as an accompaniment to the vocals, which absolutely take center stage. No one has every complained about Tom Chaplin's singing, to my knowledge.<br /><br />And there are surprises: the Radiohead-like melody of \\"Black Rain\\"; the rock-style songs like \\"On the Road.\\" They've come a long way from blatant pop like \\"Crystal Ball,\\" and this album has as much variety as Under the Iron Sea.<br /><br />Tim's lyrics have always been uneven in my opinion, and I think inspirational songs like \\"You are Young\\" or \\"Starting Line\\" have a blandly optimistic quality. Personal material like Sovereign Light Cafe hits straight home, and, luckily, Strangeland is much more personal than Perfect Symmetry.<br /><br />It's a rich album, wistful, emotional, and thoughtful, but with an upbeat quality. It's very Keane; at the same time, it's a step forward, not a safe return to past glories. What more could we want?
B005LAIHIQ|2.0|I have to admit I am both a big fan of the original series and Tim Burton. I think \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was one of the best movies I've seen in my whole lifetime. Loved \\"Sweeney Todd,\\"and I generally have a very high regard for Mr. Burton's work. But this movie, comparisons with the original series aside, is just plain awful. It lacks plot, and seems to be anchored down by its attempts to make references to the original series.<br /><br />I guess the really frustrating thing here is if you were going to reach back to the original series for material there were at least 8000 storylines & subplots that you could have drawn from. Unfortunately Seth Graham Greene chose to disregard all of those and gave us a sophomoric script that's a combination between the TV series Dallas and the previous Burton movie Beetlejuice. Seriously, the goings-on between Angelique and Barnabas remind me of the antics and sibling rivalry between Bobby Ewing and JR Ewing. As hard as Johnny Depp tries to make the material work, he just can't.<br /><br />Anybody older than 12 is going to be totally annoyed by Chloe Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard. There's just absolutely nothing likable about this character and nothing in her performance to make you care one lick about what happens to her or the rest of the family. Eva Green is totally miscast as Angelique, and Michelle Pfeiffer - who is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood - seems to be completely wasted on this material. That goes double for Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />The movie does have a couple of nice moments. Watching the opening titles with Victoria Winters riding a train into Collinwood, set to the Moody Blues \\"Nights in White Satin\\"was sort of breathtaking. And surprisingly, Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis is the bright spot in this mess of a movie. He truly is funny and got some belly laughs... more than once.<br /><br />I don't know who to be madder at. Seth Graham Greene, or Tim Burton. But I waited 50 years for someone to do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer. No one seems to have figured out that one of the reasons the original series worked is there were always two story lines going at the same time. It never was all about Barnabas Collins. There was Elizabeth Stoddard and Jason Maguire. And then there was Barnabas and Maggie Evans. The interplay between the two story lines is what made the series so interesting.  In the 1700s it was Barnabas and Angelique, and Vicky and Peter Bradford, and I can go on. Etc. etc.<br /><br />They used  the excuse that they needed to update the story for modern audience. I am insulted. Next time, How about a little bit of imagination and ingenuity?do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer.

B0048Y9TPG|5.0|I will say that if you love the first christmas album \\"Merry Christmas\\" by Mariah, then you are definitely going to love this second one \\"Merry Christmas II You\\" by her. She basically picks up where she left off on the first one, and gives you a great new spin on some old classics. She also has written 4 new songs for the record (Oh Santa!, Christmas Time Is In The Air Again, When Christmas Comes, One Child) like she did on the last christmas album. I love them all, there really isn't a particular favorite because they are all great. They are all well written produce songs that are just as good if not better, than the ones on the last christmas album. Mariah really has done a good job on this album, and down the road I think this should be consider another christmas classic by the fans and people alike.
B006RED4GA|3.0|I went into this film with high hopes after I read some great interviews about this film in a horror mag. Being a huge fan of horror, I thought this movie would be a revelation. Instead, I found it fairly average. It does have some somewhat spooky moments, but these are few and far-between, and concentrated in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. I think it tries for some Sam Raimi-type funny moments, but these moments exist without the scary, dark moments to counter the attempted fun, and it leaves the movie feeling very unbalanced.<br /><br />The story is character-driven, and focuses on the two innkeepers in an inn about to close, and a couple of the guests in the almost empty inn. The biggest issue for the innkeepers and their guests aren't ghosts, but the constant quest for towels in the rooms. We have Kelly McGillis as a cranky aging actress who seems to know more about the haunted inn than anyone. What it is that she knows, we never find out. In fact, after a promising build-up, we never find out anything about the characters, worldly or otherworldly. All of the characterization seem to get off to a good start, then go nowhere.<br /><br />When it manages to find its way to the story of the haunted-inn, it is effective.  However, the concentration of the \\"horror\\" part of this film in the last few minutes makes me feel as if I was watching two separate movies. It isn't a complete waste of time, even with it's ultimately cliched ending, and it is better than a lot of horror fare out there today. But, is it a funny, character-driven story about an inn that's closing, or is it a story about a haunted inn and the people that work there? If the film had found it's identity and stuck with it, we would have had a definite winner. As it is, it is a decently-acted, decently-filmed attempt with good special effects that could have used a little more story direction. A solid 2.5 out of 5, so I'll give it a 3.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|& let me tell you why.... When I first downloaded this game, the idea of making a thriving settlement was thrilling then it locked up on me & reset all of my buildings & crops.... I thought at first that is was just a challenge of the game but after 10-12 freezes that cause houses/crops to reset for 60-90 hours; yes i said hours which calculates out to nearly 4 days that you can do NOTHING but wait is really frustrating.  I dont suggest anybody download this game till they fix that!
B000MV90B2|4.0|Just like I remember from way back when. Christopher Plummer, Rod Steiger, a big Hollywood budget and a cast of thousands. The subtitles were the only detractor, and I couldn't find a menu option to turn them OFF-the movie is in English. Be wary of any Western flicks from China-I've heard this is a common issue. On the whole though, a good, old fashioned war movie.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|i loved this game at first, then it started taking 466 hours or something like that for something that normally only took like 10 hours. also when you exit the app thats when you regain your energy and usually takes a few hours to fill up again, i stopped playing for about a full day and when i went back expecting my energy to be full it was empty and counting dowb two minutes until i would get ONE energy; also curing sick peoples illnesses in this game is very unreasonable  you go through so many resources to make one thing and you request like 8 things to make them better. please fix these issues ; i dont want to uninstall it but its not fun to play  anymore ....it has potential!
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games<br /> \\"Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!\\"<br /><br /> The Hunger Games takes place in the nation of Panem, a place once known as North America. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, volunteers as tribute in the games for her 12 year old sister Primrose. The Hunger Games are a battle of 24 young tributes, 2 from each district, to fight to the death for a single victor. Peeta Mellark joins Katniss as the male tribute in the games, and soon after declares his love for her, creating yet another conflict. Now, she must choose between Peeta and her best friend Gale Hawthorne, causing a more relatable conflict.<br /><br /> This novel is full of action and intense situations that keep you turning the page. Although, the book is not too full of action, as to where it is hard to stay focused. It is a perfect balance of action and relationship conflicts. The likeableness of some characters depends on your personality. Gale is the tough, independent man who keeps his feelings for Katniss inside. Peeta on the other hand, is sweet and caring, and tells Katniss exactly how he feels. Katniss is the fearless girl caught in the middle, while trying to keep herself and Peeta alive. This novel shows a theme of the loss of childhood innocence in many cases. Primrose is forced to grow up too quickly in order to take care of her mother. Katniss is forced to keep herself alive and someone else alive, and Gale is forced off to work.<br /><br /> If you like action and suspense, this is definitely a book for you. I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different type of relationship conflict, but who still enjoys a little romance. This is a novel that keeps most anyone entertained and interested. It is a fantastic read.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is the last book of the Hunger Games trilogy written by Suzanne Collins. In the book the main characters are, of course, Katniss and her family. Other main characters are Peeta, Gale, Finnick, President Snow, President Coin, and a whole lot more. This third book takes place in district 13, a place thought to be completely destroyed by the Capitol. But, the people who survived the attack from the Capitol in 13 moved underground and the Capitol did not know this. All of the rebels from other districts, like district 12 which was also attacked by the Capitol and such moved down there and were now led by President Coin. Now, after saving Katniss and a few other tributes that did not include Peeta from their second Hunger Games, 13 and the rebels are planning to overthrow the Capitol and save Peeta and others who were captured by them. Will they beat the Capitol?<br /> This is a quick moving novel, at least for me, because once I was interested I could not stop reading. It starts out slow but gets faster as you read more. The characters in this novel were very likeable, at least most of them.  You get attached to the characters throughout the series and I was attached to most of the characters in that book. I did not really like President Snow, though. He was too smart and cruel for me. I believe that Mockingjay has a lot of themes but the main theme is manipulation. Both the government of the Capitol and that of the rebels in 13 are using their people as pawns, using them so they can gain control or keep it. They tell lies to their people and use manipulative tricks to get what they want. The author made this theme very noticeable in this book and did a great job at letting the reader see it.<br /> I recommend this book to people who love action and suspense and romance. This is a great book for those types of people because that is what this whole trilogy basically is but it's a great series of books and I would honestly want everyone to read it or else you're really missing out on a great story.

It was missing 7 pages from chapter 14 and the entirety of chapter 15.  I can't imagine that this is a one-time incident, so I would go to your local bookstore to purchase this book, not AMAZON!

B0081SRJSY|5.0|I was introduced to the board game &#34;Carcassonne&#34; a couple of years ago by a relative, and since then, we and our wives have played several times, and it's always a lot of fun. Unfortunately, we can't all get together too often, so I've been hoping that an Android version would be released, and now it's here.<br /><br />I'm playing Carcassonne on my Kindle Fire, which has a nice screen size for the game. If you're not familiar with Carcassonne, it's a unique game where players build the landscape from colorful tiles containing pieces of fields, roads, cities, and cloisters. In turn, each player positions their tiles, and optionally, places a &#34;Meeple&#34; on any of several locations on the tile. The game continues until the tiles run out or none of the remaining tiles are playable. Points are awarded for controlling fields, roads, cities, and cloisters, and the player with the highest score wins. It's actually much easier to play than it sounds, but learning the proper strategies takes a while. There is some luck involved, since the tiles are dealt randomly, but as with any game that has an element of luck, skill will win out in the long run.<br /><br />To me, the video version of Carcassonne has three big pluses compared to the board game:<br /><br />1. There's no argument about whether a tile placement is legal. The screen shows every possible legal tile placement, and you can't place a tile anywhere else.<br /><br />2. The game automatically keeps score during the game, and it counts the additional points that are awarded at the end of the game. In the board game, this was a real hassle sometimes, and it slowed down the game.<br /><br />3. You don't have to have live players. I've been playing against four AI opponents, and they play a pretty good game. And if you have the live players, but don't have the board game, you can use your video device to play a pass-around live game. Hopefully the developer will upgrade the game to allow live play online.<br /><br />The board game version of Carcassonne has a bunch of expansions that make the game bigger and more complex. The Android version includes the River II expansion, where you first take turns placing twelve river tiles before placing the regular tiles.<br /><br />It takes a few plays to figure out winning strategies, so don't lose hope if the AI clobbers you a few times. A couple of hints:<br /><br />1. Conserve your Meeples (note: officially they're called &#34;Followers,&#34; but Meeples is what they're usually called). You only have seven of them, and it's easy to run out of them just before you really need one.<br /><br />2. Play offense and defense. It's not just about scoring for yourself, look for opportunities to block other players from scoring.<br /><br />All-in-all, Carcassonne is a great game, and it's one of the classic board games that translated extremely well to electronic play. And with dozens of tiles coming up randomly, every game is almost guaranteed to be different.f expansions that make the game bigger and more complex.

B007VCNZMU|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I'm very partial to this particular band while recognizing that not everyone enjoys this style of music.  An ex-girlfriend once heard Sin Pecado, and she was truly horrified how much I loved them exclaiming that it sounded like 'death'.  YES!!!  <Fist pump>  Kicked her to the curb, and got a proper girl who is now my wife.  Moonspell is not only loud, dark and driving but is also melodic, beautiful and unique.  If you are new to Moonspell you have truly found a gem like no other and I encourage you to look into their catalog.  This is simply another entry in a long line of greatness.<br /><br />As far as this album is concerned I would say the standout feature that sets this apart from other Moonspell albums is the feature of guitar solos.  The trend of extended guitar solos went by the wayside in most modern metal albums, but it's nice to see it making a ferocious return in this offering.  These are not your typical showboating solos, mind you. While they may be extravagant they do not forsake the rythm and general makeup of the songs themselves.  Indeed, much of this album is a throwback to some older styles of music redone in Moonspell's near-perfect technical execution.  Perhaps, you will also appreciate hearing these updated renditions.<br /><br />I don't believe this album really breaks new ground, but that obviously wasn't their goal.  Listen to it and you will see that Moonspell clearly appreciates and remembers their history even if your significant other does not.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|Imaginaerum is a masterpiece.  It is the culmination of Nightwish's years of creating great symphonic heavy metal music.  I truly enjoy listening to this album over and over again.  Each song is different from the other, so the songs do not sound the same, except Imaginaerum which is like an overture at the end of the album.  There are different styles of music on Imaginaerum.  'Slow, Love, Slow' is a cool jazz song.  'Turn Loose The Mermaids' is more like celtic music.  There are of course powerful heavy metal songs such as 'Storytime', 'Ghost River', 'I Want My Tears Back', and 'Last Ride Of The Day'.  One of the great things about the music on this album is that the melody evolves during the songs.  It is not simple and does not stay the same, but is refreshingly complex.  'Song Of Myself' has three parts according to the CD, but it seems like two to me.  The second part is really poetry with background music:  interesting and different.  Imaginaerum is definitely one of my favority albums.
1612130283|1.0|So first, I have not read the entire book. You would have to pay me to do that. I read most of the sample out of (morbid) curiosity. The story and characters seemed mediocre.  That might possibly get better, but the prose made me unwilling to give the book any more of my time than the sample had consumed. The writing was... well, about three paragraphs in I pinpointed the sensation it left as most like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />I'm a pretty insatiable reader. (I will generally knock through three or four books in a week.) I read for entertainment, and I tend towards science fiction, romance, and fantasy. Erotica set within those genres is definitely one of my guilty pleasures. Rather than talk at length about what I consider good and bad writing, I'm going to say this:<br /><br />If you thought this was truly good, then please go and read more. Obviously you enjoyed this story. Read other authors writing in the same genre. You'll probably enjoy them more.<br /><br />As a note: I was curious, so I skimmed through the other reviews sorted by \\"most helpful\\". I had to go through about 40 pages before the one star reviews stopped dramatically dominating. Thank you fellow readers. That made me smile.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|The never ending despair, poor decisions, unrealistic story line and terrible ending make this one of the worst movies of all time. I'm currently living in Alaska, the entirety of this movie makes me want to throw up in my mouth, it's complete garbage.  To the director: I wish you were never born!  *update, downgrade from two stars to one*.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun mini games and nice variety. Earning coins to open more games doesn't seem to take very long. I think my son will enjoy playing this.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|Cruise works hard and his heart is in his work but this one didn't do it for me.<br />Problems:<br />(1.) The first noticeable problem was the dialogue. Another example of Hollywood writers who either have no clue about what they are writing about or have spent too much time watching movies. Simplistic, formula driven for each character; just a lot of jabberwocky \\"dumb speak\\".<br />(2.) Stereotypic portrayals of Eastern European bad guys; a not believable attractive female co-spy; a nerdy and goofy computer geek co-spy; the usual prisoners with tats and dumb guards; one African-American in stereotypic spot role; and all the rest of the formula roles.<br />(3.) Non creative redux storyline of agent who has supposedly lost his wife; then goes rogue; then loses his immediate superior as only contact with agency; usual \\"Russian nuclear launch codes.\\"; usual atomic bombs; usual satellite manipulation; usual computer and security hacking.<br />(4.) A way to heavy reliance on over the top high tech gadgets that were not believable; just laughable and bizarre toys.<br />(5.) More over the top action scenes that were reminiscent of a child's style game of one-upmanship e.g. grabbing a falling person by the arm (not possible) isn't the usual 13 stories but we'll show it happening at 130 stories. Just too fakey. A car chase scene that French film producers would just laugh at. Prison breakout looked cartoonish with prisoners beating on each other and the guards.<br />(6.) Too predictable of an outcome - usual submarine nuclear doomsday missile launch; countered at the last second of course.

B007OAAK0O|5.0|My mother recorded this for me on our VHS recorder and I have worn that tape out.  (yes, I could have had it transferred but....) So now that I can go out and buy a clear copy of BOTH days, I am in heaven.<br /><br />Looking back, I remember how awesome Ms. Ross was when the rain came.  She could have fled the stage, however - she stood there braving the elements keeping the crowed calm.<br /><br />During this time, Diana Ross could not be touched.  She had hit after hit record and her charisma on stage was nothing more than magical.<br /><br />Any quality of this DVD will be better than my worn out VHS, but to have both concerts here on one DVD is like a dream come true.<br /><br />I know this isn't a true review of the concert, but I am just happy that this truly amazing event is now available for the world to witness again!
0307352145|5.0|I loved this book! How many of you kindred introverts have come back from parties or conferences or other social engagements and felt really bad about yourself because you hardly talked to anyone, because you didn't network like you were \\"supposed to\\", or because you left the crowded room because you felt overstimulated?<br /><br />Well, this book by Susan Cain suggests that these types of events seem like great opportunities...if you're an extravert...but if you're an introvert, they are just not suited to your strengths. And, we should keep that in mind when we're supposed to attend these types of events. Moreover, she suggests ways that introverts can make the most of these types of situations.<br /><br />Cain's book is comprehensive review of psychological research on topics related to introversion. She unveils a list of strengths that introverts have that extraverts don't. One such strength is the need to deliberate carefully before making a decision, which she points out could have avoided a lot of the mistakes that have crippled our economy.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to my brother and sister introverts!
B005HEQKDU|5.0|I absolutely love the fact that I can watch any episode of TNG any time I want to. Awesome Thing Amazon is doing with instant streaming video.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|At least at the time of writing this review, buying the 3 books on Kindle separate is almost a $1 cheaper than buying them all together. Just buy em separate. The books are good, but there's no reason to overpay just because it comes in a \\"set.\\"

B000W8HC8I|5.0|My interest in the Wolf was piqued when I learned Leo DiCaprio was starring in a movie based on the book. So I went to order and saw many mixed reviews and almost didn't.<br /><br />Glad I realized if Leo Dicaprio and Martin Scorcesse were making a movie of it, there had to be good stuff here.<br /><br />And there is a ton of it. Lots of sex, drugs, swearing and money. In other words, a realistic depiction of Wall Street.<br /><br />Is the book perfect? No book is.<br /><br />However, this is a great from the trenches Wall Street story and I couldn't put the thing down until I passed out in bed each night. It may not be 5 stars for everyone, but for people who like to read about Wall Street (or Long Island here technically) rich people and rich Wall Street types behaving badly, this is a gem.
0345803485|5.0|Read the reviews of the trilogy for the facts. Now I want to review the steamy ways the author describes the interaction between Christian and \\"Anna\\". This series of books are very well done, very graphic, much so that you think you are in the \\"play\\" room with this beautiful couple. My experiences with these books range from sweet remembrances of my sex life with my husband over the past many years, mystery, good plot, discreetly done without a LOT of nasty words other than F---, which most of us can endure. I also have spent many late hours reading because I simply didn't know when to turn off my kindle in fear of  missing something. The books read quickly. If deciding to venture into this trilogy, consider buying the three in one because you don't want to be without the next book of series and left hanging, especially if you are a romantic. As you can guess, I thoroughly enjoyed this story and wonder \\"what in the heck am I going to find to read to keep me so enthralled now?\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun and addictive little set of games, but after the first set of levels, they get a little expensive to purchase
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I do not get HBO, so, to learn that the Game of Thrones has been made into a series, just had me all excited. This trilogy was written by my favorite fantasy writer, and this is my favorite ever. I must admit I was scared to watch this, since I have not seen it on HBO first, but I bought it any way, and man am I not disappointed. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent story. Imagination of the reader is awesome. Keeps one on the edge. Have not seen first movie yet. Can't wait.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I saw Sade in St. Louis, Missouri and I was in the second row center. I was transported to a whole new world and it was the best concert that I have ever seen IN MY LIFE!. I was so impressed that I followed her to Louisville, KY two weeks later!! Sade is a true performer and she gave her audience an experience to remember! The band was beyond belief! The performances sounded better than the recordings and when she sang Love is Stronger Than Pride, I went insane! Sade is one of those rare performers that can get the audience up and dancing one minute and then transfix them when she sings such heartbreaking songs such as PEARLS. I hate that Sade only tours once every decade but it is worth the wait!!! I will follow her to the moon for her next performance and I hope and pray that she will tour again! Until then, I will watch this Blu-Ray until it wears out and when it does, I will buy another one!<br />SADE RULES THE WORLD OF MUSIC! She is like an oasis in a desert of pop-friendly but utterly talentless drivel.
030758836X|3.0|I have rather mixed feelings about this book. I really looked forward to reading it - I love both of Flynn's previous books in all their absorbing and dark strangeness. And while this latest novel is certainly interesting, it did not live up to my admittedly high expectations for it.<br /><br />It is well-written - without a doubt. The characters, in both their positive and negative qualities, are three-dimensional and realistic. They come more and more to life as the reader is drawn deeper and deeper into the marriage of Nick and Amy. The complexity that is added in the second and third sections makes the book particularly enjoyable.<br /><br />The length of the first section, and the blatant reader manipulation, however, really bothered me. This first section makes up more than half of the book, and by the second section, I at least, felt that too much time had been devoted to a deception. While this does help build rapport with one of the central characters, it made the second and third sections, which were much stronger, seem much too short in length and led to a not fully satisfying conclusion based on everything that was built up in the first section.
1451648537|5.0|The biography of Steve Jobs is an amazing story. The biography is largely based on Steve Jobs even though it may mention the other Steve, Steve Wozniak. He wasn't as important to the biography as Steve Jobs, but he still played a big part. The biography talks about Job's entire life from the beginning to end. One of the main conflicts was losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1985; Job's left Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business markets. This led Jobs to found and become CEO of Pixar. He is credited with the making of the 1995 film of Toy Story.<br /><br />Although this book was nearly 600 pages, it was a relatively quick read. During the length of this biography it seemed as though Jobs was a very charismatic individual, until the Apple board terminated. Even though he was set for life with a huge amount of money, Jobs wanted more. He strived to be a master of innovation. New ideas would hit him all the time and he had to at least test them because of his determination. I believe the theme of this book is to never give up. Steve Jobs, a college drop out, became the legendary visionary he is today because he never gave up. He had ideas and he pursued them.<br /><br />This biography is recommended for young adults. Young adults would really enjoy this book because it gives a great example of a person who never gave up no matter what the obstacles that presented to them. Steve Jobs left college to pursue a dream that may or may not have been successful at that time.<br />Jobs the risks knew when he left college but had the determination to make sure his ideas and dreams came true.
B004J4WN0I|2.0|I was really excited about this book when I read the sample of it....i liked the intelligent humor....reminded me of the Lightning Thief series a bit but more adult oriented...so I bought it...started to read past where the sample ended and was instantly disapointed...is the EFF word really that necessary??...the language totally ruined it for me...after 2 or 3 chapters I couldn't go on...THANK YOU Amazon for refunding me!...I wish they rated books like movies so we might have a better idea of what we are buying into....Loved the idea of the storyline...just wish out of respect for the general public that more refined words could have been used....the world is moral mess....ah well....whatdayado!

B0035J6TAI|5.0|Je suis un inconditionnel de Peter Gabriel depuis Genesis. J'aime autant ses disques solos que ses incursions en BOF (Birdy, Passion) ou dans ses collectifs sous son label Real World. J'ai toujours considéré qu'il était un créateur hors du commun avec une très grande intelligence émotionnelle. C'est Gabriel qui a composé Biko, Don't give up (interprétée avec l'inclassable Kate Bush), In your eyes ou I grieve...ce magnifique cri du caeur au deuil insupportable. C'est Gabriel qui nous a cultivé la musique du monde, de Yousou N'Dour aux jeunes talents comme ce Hobo de Charlie Winston. Génie? Exigent? Nul doute. Difficile de ne pas respecter son cheminement d'artiste unique et d'admirer sa grande curiosité. Et le voici maintenant avec ses interprétations choisies et enrobées d'une musique parfois symphonique, parfois minimaliste - sans batterie, sans guitares - ce ne sera quand même pas le chômage pour David Rhodes et Toni Levin, hi hi! Encore une fois, on ne peut que s'incliner devant sa culture de la musique et cette sensibilité avec laquelle il nous livre d'inventives interprétations. Il faut se trouver un moment de solitude et de détente pour apprécier cette aeuvre et la laisser nous envahir. Créer, c'est ne plus jamais être seul (je ne sais pas qui a écrit ça?). La voix de l'ange Gabriel est à son meilleur. J'étais au rendez-vous le 28 avril au Centre Bell de Montréal. Merci, c'était un évènement.
0385341008|5.0|Reading \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" made me feel like I had come across a forgotten box of letters in the attic. The correspondence format lets the reader get to know the quirky and lovable characters in layers. The letters start out as formal introductions, but evolve into personal messages that reveal secrets, scandals and hidden delights.

1596680296|5.0|Of all the things worth knitting, socks are one of the most complex, but also the most fun. This book does an excellent job of describing all the steps involved, the parts of the socks, the terminology, the options available... In short, a great introduction. As a nicely bound hardcover with lots of pictures, it also makes a great gift for knitter friends.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|best pool game I've found yet..although whenplaying opp nonlinear the stick tends not to load. so you or your opp leave.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The author did a good job of describing memory loss through the eyes of someone who has the disease. I often hear stories of people supporting those with memory loss and how it changes their lives but this is a great story of how it changes the life of the person with memory loss. It is really an interesting perspective. Especially to show how someone could forget how to do the most simple tasks, such as taking care of themselves. Sad but very insightfull. Would recommend it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Was reconmended this game by a friend and i think it is one if the best android games i have played. Simple controls, great courses and not actually proper golf so even non golf fans will love it. Well worth at least trying!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed the book, Good surprise ending.  Could have really done without the foul language, it did nothing to enhance the story.
B003O86FMW|2.0|5 STARS For the book..... just 2 stars for the process of buying it through Amazon.  I loved the idea of the convenience behind purchasing a digital copy of the book onto my ipad.  However, it was not as easy as I thought it would have been.  Be careful what you click on and good luck trying to get a real person on the phone for help.  I had uploaded he Kindle App to my ipad, but instead somehow ordered a different digital version which I still don't understand why it didn't go to my Kindle App.  Not very easy to actually talk with someone to get this resolved, so... I will probably just buy the actual book since this wasn't a great first experience buying the book digitally.

B00783NWB6|1.0|the movie is 'ok' but the digital copy doesn't work with itunes, requires you to install some microsoft BS software to STREAM, and the usability of their website and explanations are sorely lacking.  I will NEVER buy another sony movie again because of this ultraviolet rip-off digital copy.  Stick to traditional digital copies that are not made by sony.  Thanks for the frustration.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|first started with a plan for easter then after 40 days wanted to continue to read more.  the interpretation makes it so much easier for Catholics like myself who dont read the bible as much as i should.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|People don't seem to get this in terms of the big picture. As a standard action movie it's a little slow, but the action stuff is the least interesting part of the film.<br /><br />This story is about the relationship between humanity and nature. The people of this world live entirely cut off from everything natural, though there are occasionally pristine manicured lawns and apparently genetically-engineered fruits. Outside the walls is dense jungle, kept constantly at bay by a constant spray of poisons from automated machines. Inside everything is perfect, monitored, and tightly controlled.<br /><br />There's a resistance movement struggling against the leadership but it isn't clear why. Aeon, the protagonist, is sent to kill the leader, Goodchild. On her mission she learns that the world isn't what she thought it was.<br /><br />People who don't get this story are focusing too close, looking at it in terms of human characters. Don't. Consider it instead in terms of nature struggling to reclaim what has been taken by humanity, and a completely different picture emerges. Nature itself is a character, here.
B0024FADDI|5.0|I ordered this after researching the many different versions of this movie. There are different endings, optional endings, and other extras you may be concerned about. I chose the \\"Screwhead\\" version as it seemed to follow the story I remembered best. Great color and great looking video for a dvd version. I was pleased with my purchase. BTW, hilarious if you like this kind of humor.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great story and keeps you engaged at all times. I COULD NOT put it down.  I am a bed time reader and had many nights that I had to force myself to put it down and go to sleep. Anastasia and Christian are an amazingly twisted yet normal couple all at the same time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a great game. Really had to think hard to work your way through it. Nice graphics. Don't expect to have your hand held thorough the game, this is a game that you have to reason your way through and use your mind. If you want someone to tell you what to do next, then this game is not for you.
B0063GORYU|5.0|good game play, nice graphics (I play it on my kindle fire), allows multiple undo, keeps track of number of moves and of elapsed time, provides hints. typical spider game rules. choose random game or specific game. I waste, erm, spend lots of time playing this game.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I first heard about this amazing trio of musicians probably from Amazon as a suggested listen for me since I like the blues. Then I found out their music is featured in the soundtrack to The Hunger Games. Last, I heard them played last weekend on the radio in a weekly Saturday night blues show from WXPN, an NPR station from the University of Pennsylvania. I had them on my wishlist and got a promotional credit from Amazon to download music. Finally had to do it after hearing so much about them. How can I describe them? Their music is part blues, bluegrass, ragtime, folk, old-time Americana traditional music, and so much more to describe. Rhiannon Giddens voice is sweet. Fiddle and banjo playing is lively and spirited and makes you just want to get up and dance your heart out. The recording is crystal clear. I especially love the title track, Leaving Eden. The song is a sweet lullaby and Giddens voice is calming and soothing. I plan to play this one in my yoga classes. No Man's Mama, another favorite of mine which had been played on WXPN, features Giddens lovely voice again. It is a song about the freedom a woman has from a recent divorce: no sadness here in this song, a celebration of freedom! Pretty Bird, another favorite, again features Giddens magnificent voice, unaccompanied by instruments. It sounds almost like a tune of gospel music to me, soothing and lullaby like. The album is very professionally done and we will definitely be hearing more from this talented trio of musicians.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a really fun and challenging game. I cant stop playing. I want to win every level. it can be addicting!
0307594165|5.0|I'm always anxious to read anything Ms. Morrison writes and this is no exception. Although, the book was slim in size, the story fairly leapt off the pages and rose to heights that cannot be measured. She is not a Nobel-Laureate for nothing. While others designate her as an author or writer interchangeably, I say, she is a storyteller. This proves that even more than some of her more lauded and celebrated volumes. She is a storyteller. She pulls you in and you're stuck. Gratefully, so.<br /><br />This story is filled with angst, but I also saw the hero in Frank Money. He hated himself for crimes unmentionable, but in that self-hatred is his redemption. As long as he didn't get comfortable with what he had done, he could make peace with it and heal. He could overcome it. He could be a real man.<br /><br />Ms. Morrison has done it again and will no doubt, keep doing it. Bravo!

0345803485|1.0|So like everyone else here I picked up the book because it was on the NY Times bestsellers list. I was on page 100 when I just couldn't go on. THIS became a bestseller? Really?? I am appalled. The quality of writing is horrendous. Let me give you an example: \\"Holy c r a p! Christian Grey is looking at me. Holy s h i t! Christian Grey is talking to me. Holy moses! Christian Grey is touching his lips.\\" And its all in same paragraph. Who writes like that? More importantly how does NY Times puts it on their bestseller list? What American says \\"I will make supper now\\"? It's like a grown up erotica written by a 15 year old dits. This makes the popular vampire series books look like a work of art!

B00723NWJE|5.0|I just got my new Norah Jones cd yesterday.I had to play it a couple of times to get the feel of it. After that I realize that I really love this CD, some songs I like better than others.\\"Say Goodbye\\" has a good beat to it, it almost wants to make me get up and dance to it except for the sad words to it.\\"Out on the Road\\"is another favorite.\\"4 Broken Hearts\\" has a bluesy sound to it.<br />People, you must understand that Norah no longer has her \\"Very Handsome Band\\", so the sound will probably never be the same as her earlier CDs. But I really don't think that this one is that far off. She has all new and different artists playing with her now. Good Job Norah.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|a great read. Aside from the sex that people have named Â«mommy pornÂ» is a story about a rich man who wants to enter into a dom/submissive relationship. he is a flawed man who has never really felt love until he meets Ana who he persues to be his submissive. I highly recomend book 2 because he decides its worth having a vanilla sex life if it means loving her
B003VANOFY|2.0|These headphones actually produce decent sound for gaming and have a decent range.  The battery lasts a good 8 hours or so as well.  If you are into listening to music with deep bass, don't bother with these.<br /><br />They worked fine for about a year or so and then the plastic on the right head phone broke.  I had to duct tape it back.  Then, the microphone plastic snapped.  I use them daily, but I'm not rough with them at all.  If you buy these, expect a year out of them.

This book has a very good story with many different people, and all it makes me want to do is find other books like it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game needs a little more explanatin about what deal types represent and statistics are too hidden. Other than that this is a great version of a classic game.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The player performs flawlessly, but does so only from the phones internal storage.  More importantly I cannot find an option for storing downloaded music to any alternate locations.  I have manually moved my music to a newly installed SD card.  I hope the player will see the music there.  If so, all will be well.  The player itself can happily reside on the phones internal storage while the data rich music is on the SD card.  The only other ding I have on this app is the equalizer.  I wish it was more sophisticated.
0393316041|5.0|Dr. Feynman's book is the most interesting memoir I've ever read!  He's not just a scientist: he's an adventurer!  This book includes his account of everything from the technical to the off-the-wall.  Great read about one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Bought this in advance of the Avenger's movie.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  The price was great, I couldn't find it cheaper in the stores.<br /><br />The movie itself was well done and included everything as advertized.  The action and the story were paired well with good acting.<br /><br />Only a few scenes that may be suitable for all ages due to being scary, not graphic.
0393320928|5.0|If you read Dr. Feynman's first book \\"Surely your joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" you'll want to pick up a copy of this book too!  It continues Dr. Feynman's memoirs about his adventures around the world and in many pursuits.  It has a very candid tone when he speaks about his time at Los Alamos and his wife's illness which gives a great perspective on this brilliant man.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Great soundtrack to a great movie.<br />The soundtrack can truly stand on it's own.<br />Features every track from the film, and at least one slightly extended one.<br />Well written, performed, and produced.<br />Very enjoyable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am a high school English teacher, and am always looking for fresh stories for my classes to read. This is not only a book that will catch both male and female readers, but any age group and lovers of fantasy and sci-fi. It contains all the intrigue a mystery reader would like, has the romance and even puts a modern spin on \\"Lord Of The Flies\\", what more do you need to involve students? Personally I devoured all three books in 4 days. Which means it would not be an extended assignment for even freshmen class.  Seeing the author is  Suzanna Collins, an American author, we now have a great modern piece for American Lit classes. I even talked my 74 year old mom into reading the first book. She then asked to borrow the rest of the series! What a hit!
0545265355|5.0|I read the entire series in about two weeks, everyone was telling me to read it since 2011.<br />I gotta say as a history buff I really enjoyed this one, and through the entire series I was thinking to myself this woman has to be a student of history and war, and not to my surprise I was right.<br />I don't want to get into details for obvious reasons but will say it was an easy read, you can read the entire series in a few days if you are not to busy.  It really was a series I got excited about and I am glad I saw the movie before I read the first book.<br /><br />The price however is only $10-$15 at Walmart and I wish I would have bought it there.
0345803507|5.0|This was one of the best books that I have read. I found that once I started I couldnt put it down! I cant wait more Fifty Shades (if there are any and I am hoping there are)!
0345803485|5.0|This story is about a wealthy young man, Christian Grey, who accidentally meets Anastasia Steele.  Ana is a college student who is going to graduate, and does in the story line, she steps in to help her roommate with a once in a lifetime interview for the school paper. From their very first meeting sparks and tension seem to fly right off the page.  Grey is interested in Ana and begins a very tentative relationship at first.<br /><br />As the story line progresses you see that the characters are flawed, intense and have varying needs.  Christian has a dark side that is hinted at from the beginning of the book, but he is the most flawed of the two main characters.  He is a very intense man, has had a harsh upbringing until he was adopted and now has darker passionate side that controls his relationships.  Ana on the other hand is very self conscious, her one major flaw, but has had a relatively normal life.  She's relatively naïve, but has a very sarcastic and independent personality.<br />These two seem to be so dissimilar at first, the clumsy college student and the powerfully successful businessman.  But, these two are inexorably drawn to each other for different reasons and make compromises to be part of the other's life.  There are heartbreaking stories connected to Christian Grey, that remain mostly a mystery and the funny quirky sense of humor that both characters display, as well as a first love romance that is exceptional.<br /><br />The wit and humor that is written through the book are absolutely delightful and make the characters more personable to the reader.  Most people have that tenacious best friend that would love to tackle any challenge for you or your own flawed perception your self image. Everyone has insecurities, everyone has been in a situation where they wonder how exactly it came to be, and everyone has struggled with tough decisions.<br /><br />Now, I know many reviewers have stated that this is an incredibly erotic book going so far as to claim it unsuitable to read.  Yes, the book is erotic, but the whole story line as a whole is no worse than other romance stories, the only difference is this dwells on a  the dominate side of sex with one person submitting to another and not the overly flowery glossed over version found in most books.  This book glosses over nothing, not emotions or actions.<br /><br />This book is so much more than meets the eye and so much more than what the synopsis lets on.<br /><br />I personally will be looking forward, and desperate, to begin reading 50 Shades of Darker and 50 Shades of Freed which continues Anastasia and Christian's stories.  I am looking forward to the character development that is hinted and I know will be coming.claim it unsuitable to read.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I've seen both versions of fright night,the Roddy Macdowel one from 1985 and the 2011 version.I must say,this viewer loved the 2011 version!Colin Farrell,David Tennant(dr.who)and Toni Collett,the guy that played the young hero and Imogen Poots all were fantastic and held my attention.Sometimes comical(esp the scene where David tennant complained about the leather pants chafing his crotch and esp in the bloopers where he says there's pus on it and how it doesn't look normal,which makes everyone laugh and flub the scene)David Tennant and Colin Farrell are definitely ones to watch.Colin as Jerry the vampire is so handsome appealing to the eyes.I would be mesmerized by those handsome eyes and be temtped to let him bite me then BAM! stake him in the heart!!It's not really scary but i'd give it 2 bites up(2 thumbs up).I miss David Tennant not being dr who,boo.What has he done for me lately? Made me watch this awesome movie over and over again just 2 see him and Colin.5stars!!so say there's a creepy guy that moves in next door and only comes out at night, beware If he tries to kiss you, it could be a kiss that lasts for eternity! It's about a neighbor that moves in and tries to f##& the teens life up!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Easy to follow and easy to play. Sometimes the word doesn't match the object, though. One screen asked for a flute.  The actual object was a clarinet. I wasted a hint on that. overall a good game
B004FOA84A|5.0|worth the purchase. played through this and lost city. I'm waiting for more games from these guys. they really know how to make a point and click game.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The same thing happened to me that seemed to have happened to just about everyone else.  It's a weird glitch where the screen freezes, then the counter resets to a crazy amount of time (mine was 150+ hrs for some houses, crops and animals) before you can \\"collect\\".<br /><br />Normally I would have been like \\"I've got better things to do\\" and unistalled but I'm not one to give up so easily when it is a fun app.<br /><br />These are things I have tried and worked (mostly) if you're determined enough to keep playing.<br /><br />-The counters tended to go berzerk when I exited the game while an animal was still running loose in the town. Now I always check before exiting and haven't had the problem since.<br /><br />-When \\"situations\\" arise, choose the most absurd solution. You will usually be punished by having some of your crops and/or houses and/or animals damaged/restarted.  This will restart the clock at the correct time for those things affected. If you do this enough times, you'll eventually get most things back to the correct time.<br /><br />-With crops, you always have the option to sell the plot then replant, which is what I did. You'll loose a bit of money but it was way better than waiting the 100+ hours until they are ready to harvest.<br /><br />***The above are just things that have worked for me and by no means, is a universal fix-it guide.***<br /><br />Come on boys and girls, remember when you were in kindergarten and you were encouraged to \\"never give up\\"... well if it's worth having, it's worth trying for.<br /><br />But if you weren't enjoying the game before the glitch, then I say good riddence. Your life is probably more productive without these types of time-vacuums... I miss the Sun.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got the original Quell as a free app of the day.  It was so enjoyably addictive that I purchased the sequel.  There was no disappointment; the sequel is just as fun and adds wonderful new twists!
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I can neither update my profile nor invite anyone to be a connection with this app.  I'm not sure what the developers of this app were thinking, except to say &quot;hey we have an app!&quot;  Good for you; now try making one that has some functionality.  This is my first experience with LinkedIn, and if the site is as lame as the app, then I won't waste my time on it.
0345529057|2.0|It is a hard and long read.  Watch it on Showtime.  I love to read but doubt if I can finish one of these much less 4.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The passion of the Christ is a movie that everybody should watch. It makes everything the Bible says about Christ's passion and death very real.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I love the Underworld series anyhow, but this  movie is off the charts. I highly recommend Awakening and if you have Blu-ray make sure to hold onto your hat. If you are a Selena fan you will not be disappointed!
B0019C6ETE|5.0|This is a non-fiction and a true story toled by Ken Follett as though it were a fiction. Follett has an amazing ability in describing the scenes of a country that he has probably not been in, which lends me to believe that he had done his homework pretty well through interviews and other research. However, I must slightly criticize him in stating that `Iran is a primitive country'. Iran is far from being primitive, I should know because I lived there and I'm familiar with the culture. But not to make a finer point of it, I do agree that the government -not the people- of the past 33 years is indeed primitive. Even the Iranians agree. I praise Follett for this superb work. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love the story line! I did not expect to get soo sucked into the second book but it has it's twists and turns as well:)
B0024FADAQ|5.0|This was a great movie start to finish. Robert Preston, Lance Guest, Dan O'Herlihy were all superb and the story is one that kids can relate to.
0439023521|4.0|I wound up loving this story line! It took me a little while to get \\"sucked\\" into the story like everyone says they did, but once the games started I could not put it down!
B007K87C4M|5.0|First listen right now and I love it.  Its going to be one of those albums where you can't listen to just one track.  Like dark side and houses of the holy, etc. it has to be enjoyed beginning to end.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|hate it it Sucks you get so bored after a while. don't get it. really don't think about getting it even
B007V2UGPE|4.0|a lot of fun.  you can buy things with actual money but the game seems playable without.  I like the cute animation.
0066620996|5.0|A great book, with clear insight, and actionable advice that will be sure to make an impact in  your company's performance!  Very useful!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I give this show 10 stars if i could i wasnt a fan of vampires or anything fantasy until twilight and when I found out about this show I was totally hooked! I am a bigger fan of vampire diaries then i am of twilight. What I love about this show is it doesnt focus just on vampires but has some werewolf thrown into it.  I also love that it gives you surprise after sursprise and still leaves you wanting more, eve leaves you thinking hours after you stopped watching
0307592731|2.0|I wanted to like this book but quickly became annoyed by the author's constant whining and lack of personal responsibility.  For example she gets upset by having no money but as soon as she gets some she spends it within hours.  Or she thinks it's dangerous to get into a vehicle with one stranger only to get out and immediately get into another vehicle with someone she met a couple of hours earlier and drives off.  And who packs several condoms when going on a wilderness hike alone??<br /><br />In addition to much self pity is a horrendous and bloody shooting of a horse that lends nothing to this story.  And I was exceedingly appalled by her admission of eating some of her mother's cremated bones.  She has the writing skills but this book is not at all as the publisher describes it.<br /><br />Update:  I recommend 'Becoming Odyssa'  by Jennifer Pharr Davis instead. It's also a memoir of a young woman who faced trials and self-discovery on a long hike.  Unlike Strayed she exercises common sense and relays her story in a manner that speaks of endurance and inspiration vs. the whining and self pity that Strayed specializes in.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My 16 month old son loves these! I am impressed with how sturdy they are. It comes with a net bag to hang them on the tub to dry. They actually dry very quickly too. The set has just about everything you can think of with transportation (cars, taxi, trucks, plane, bus, bike). The colors are very bright too. My son was not a big fan of bath time before but these keep him busy and happy now!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|for a digital copy I love it. I prefer my real Bible,  but I like how you can set up a reading plan and it guides you along.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The first chapters are character development and fool you into believing this is a decent read. This book is X rated and the free Amazon sample doesn't warn the reader. The author could have developed this story with out all the F words. The \\"prince\\" is a pervert in this storyline. Unfortunately the college graduate Ana takes too long to figure this out. Grey makes frogs look good. Save your money.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|boss. I really do love this game me and friends compare our accoutered an see who is winning this game is so awesome I love italic
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoyed the puzzles, they became quite challenging. It is a unique game. The music is calming and the gameplay is addicting.
B007URCTOG|3.0|The story line was a real tear jerker! I liked a good portion of it! but when the story came to a certain point where u would expect them to get back together it did'nt happen! kind of dissapointing to me! I don't know what it was but i thought the writeing was'nt that good! the acting was really good, just could not get over the writeing or the story!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is amazing I cannot wait to see the movie! Also I love my kindle bc it makes reading so much easier for me!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I picked up this book not long after finishing  [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]] and finished both this one and [[ASIN:0756407125 The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)]] in little over a month.  I typically have my Kindle on hand when doing Cardio at the gym (because let's face it, one can only watch so much TV while doing cardio). The author has an amazing talent for leaving you wanting more at the end of each chapter and as a result his series motivated me to return day, after day and lengthen my cardio times just to read a little bit more. I was disappointed to learn that his second book had come out so recently, but I have a feeling that when the third book comes out I won't mind re-familiarizing myself with the books before moving onto the third.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|First...this works very well on the Kindle Fire!  The graphics are great and the local network multiplayer works with no problems.  My wife and I use our Kindles to go head to head against computer opponents and each other.  Winning isn't all that difficult.  You just have to be cutthroat against the computer (but that's how we play the card game anyway!)  Second...a few of the rules are a bit weird.  But in fairness, when I say weird, it's just that we have never seen/used them before.  But over all the game works very well and it makes for some fun evenings!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series.  Highly reccommend!  The number of characters can be confusing to some so if it is to you, watch the series first on tv.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that this app is fun because you don't just get all the games at once you actually have to earn the points to &quot;buy&quot; the games
B000KIPT30|5.0|I use this at home on my project studio it works great for headphone sessions. I use it all the time to run an extra set of headphone in to my vocal booth/closet. It's all metal the knobs are great and very smooth to turn. For the money you can't beat it. Its not professional quality but Ive done some professional quality work with it with no problem.
0439813786|4.0|I had heard many good things about this book and wasn't disappointed. The creative and whimsical story is marvelous. But the author's way of mixing drawings, photography and prose is truly astounding. This is the work of a true master storyteller.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it reminds me of the old Oregon trail. very easy and a lot to do. I play it every day and will continue to do so.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Fantastic software. Install was very straightforward (all things considered). I love the firewall controls, especially! I'm also impressed by the remote lockup/wipe feature.  What a great program. If there were a better app that cost money, I'd buy it. As far as I can tell, there isn't.
B005WNF4NI|3.0|Saw this reviewed in the IHT news. THey raved about  the \\"music\\" and the composer. It must have been the composers mom...
B007DJUO8O|5.0|As an enthusiastic follower of both Opeth and Porcupine Tree (and their respective frontmen), I've been anxiously awaiting this album since the project was first announced a couple of years ago. Since then, both Steven and Mikael have made their rounds in the press trying to control expectations and make it clear that this album was not going to be what most fans probably expected.<br /><br />There's a certain melancholy that can be felt through most of the music here. Rather than emphasizing melody or rhythm, all tracks except the first are about soundscapes, mood, and ambience. There's lots of acoustic guitar accompanied by sparse orchestration and occasional vocals. There are still many layers to the music, but they are much more subtle than those present in either Porcupine Tree's or Opeth's music.<br /><br />Drag Ropes, for which a video was released not long ago, starts off the album and has been mentioned as the stand out track by several reviewers already. It's definitely the closest thing on the album to traditional Opeth/PT, while still fitting in with the mood and overall musical thematic of Storm Corrosion. There's a section in the middle driven mostly by the layered vocals of both Mikael and Steven that would probably make any Porcupine Tree fan feel right at home and is arguably the high point of the song, although the guitar solo that follows afterwards is also phenomenal.<br /><br />The second track, Storm Corrosion, offers a different musical landscape driven mainly by a soft acoustic guitar and Steven's vocals. The sound effects of a storm and simple but beautiful orchestration provide most of the additional texture. There's a certain intimacy that comes from how the vocals were recorded and the melodies that is very striking and somewhat captivating. There's quite a bit more activity once the song reaches its mid-point that leads into a slow buildup of dissonance and noise reminiscent of some of the work Steven did in [[ASIN:B001O2ZW1A Insurgentes (CD & DVD)]].<br /><br />Hag, the third cut on the album, kicks off with a very simple melody composed of just a few notes. A simple bass line accompanied by very modest percussion provides a hypnotic beat that comes in and out as the layers of sound develop. Close to the end, the track offers the only moment in the album even remotely resembling metal with some very intense drumming that has been heavily stylized and processed.<br /><br />Happy, in contrast to the two previous tracks, is much more straightforward in adhering strictly to sparse instrumentation, clean vocals, and acoustic playing. There is a significant amount of activity going on in the background in the form of drones that introduce some interesting dissonance or brief glimpses of what sounds like an overdriven guitar along with various sound effects. It's a beautiful track that can be easily missed when the album is just playing in the background.<br /><br />The fifth track, Lock Howl, is a much busier piece of music with a clearly identifiable beat provided by a lightly palm-muted guitar. Towards the middle, the palm-muted guitar is replaced by hand-claps as the main rhythmic device in what is one of the most memorable moments in the album. After that, we're left with another touch of dissonance in the background as the beat is slowly brought back and a new melody introduced that is soon joined by layered instrumentation.<br /><br />The final number, Ljudet Innan, starts off with beautiful singing by Mikael that is quite different from anything he's ever put out with Opeth. Although still kind of abstract, this track is probably the closest the album gets to a traditional song even incorporating a simple, but fitting drum beat towards the middle. It's a beautiful closer that provides a perfect contrast with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strangely addicting and beautiful album, but it's definitely not an album for every occasion (or for every individual). Some have made theargument that a lot of the music here makes great background music but, while I don't disagree, I think careful listening will help in revealing the little details that make the album stand out. There's a lot to find in those dissonant notes that so effectively shift the mood of a track or the quiet drones that remain in the background to complement the sparse instrumentation on top.<br /><br />It's fair to say that my expectations for this album were impossibly high. Having loved Steven's [[ASIN:B0058WFO06 Grace for Drowning]], but being a bit disappointed by Opeth's [[ASIN:B005CM9DX6 Heritage]]; I was unsure of whether the end result would resonate with me as I hoped it would. I can't say that it completely blew away my expectations, but it consistently met them and, in this case, that's quite a bit of praise.argument that a lot of the music here makes great background music but, while I don't disagree, I think careful listening will help in revealing the little details that make the album stand out.

B006QKJZMW|5.0|This is not torture porn, there are only a few scenes of pure evil and they will scare you to death.  You get to know the Characters more in this one and like them which makes it all the more tragic.  More plot twists than the originals, a must see for Horror fans who want more than just blood, a good plot as well that is deeper than parts one and 2.

B00170MYIS|5.0|I was skeptical at first to purchase these batteries because of the negative reviews stating the batteries they received were defective, some claiming they received counterfeit batteries. I decided to take the risk, so I ordered two of them for a little over $15 a piece. I'm glad I did, because for less than the retail price that one of these would normally cost, I received two legitimate Sony InfoLITHIUM NP-FG1 batteries. I've tested both of them and they work flawlessly with my new Sony HX30V. As far as the packaging it was more than adequate, the batteries were stored in their plastic protective cases inside a bubble wrapped envelope. Should anyone decide to purchase these, then I'd like to inform you my purchase was through ZeeMo Digital. I'm sure you'll have a similar experience if you do the same.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game works well on Kindle Fire but there is no way to disable the advertisements.  If you don't mind a short, digital commercial between games, you will enjoy this game.  Setting allow the user to deal from the left or right side.  My mother and I both have Kindle Fires, linked to the same account, one download works on both devices.  This would get five stars if disabling ads were possible.

B006XOBFB0|5.0|Perahia's set has long been considered one of the best complete sets--I can echo that. His recording #23 (K 488) has long been one of my favorites--he's at one with Mozart in this most graceful concerto and the ECO's winds and strings provide great support. If you're looking for overwrought drama, tinkly drawing room performances, or HIP style, look elsewhere. If you're looking for superb pianism and modern instruments, this is your set.<br /><br />The one omission that these low-priced box sets have is any kind of notes or booklet. Therefore, I'm confused about who plays on the concerto for 3 pianos. The box only lists Perahia and Radu Lupu as pianists--I don't know who plays the 3rd piano--is it an overdub? [EDIT: I've confirmed D. Altschuler's comment--this is indeed the 2-piano version of the concerto for 3 pianos]<br /><br />However, one of the best things about this set is that every concerto is complete on a single CD--none are spread over two CDs. That is a drawback of the very good Uchida/Tate set. Very convenient!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book is really carried along by the momentum of the first two books. This is needed as this book can be disappointing at times. Why? The stories are character driven, and by this book Kat has devolved from a strong character with potential to do great things to a girl who hides in closets. Even side missions lack resolution. I realize there is a trend to focus on teenage angst in this sort of book. However, I think this is overdone here.<br /><br />This is still a strong series. The first book is now one of my favorites. The second is also a good read. This book, though somewhat disappointing, is still worth struggling through.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I don't watch a lot of television, but I do allow myself to get hooked on a few series (Mad Men and The Walking Dead presently).  I very happily added Once Upon a Time to the list this year.  Very skillfully written, especially in terms of transversing the fairy tale world and the \\"real world\\" Storybrooke.  And I appreciate the way the writers fractured a few fairy tales in the interest of advancing certain plot lines.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I think the characters are rich and multi-dimensional.  Some of the most interesting aspects of the show are found it its dark undercurrents/themes.  It might be an 8:00 show, but it is definitely an 8:00 show with an edge.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch.  Robert Carlyle will always be a favorite, but all of the actors are spot on for their characters.  It has been a great first season and I look forward to Sunday's finale with mixed feelings.  I can't wait to see what happens, but I will miss watching the show over the summer.
B0031R5K68|2.0|Started well but soon became extremely irritating. Far too long, wooden characters, and ultimately ludicrous. So many lost hours! Extremely disappointing
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. There is action and suspense throughout the book. Couldn't wait to start the next in the set.
0340203161|5.0|There are several main characters in this novel that we follow. They are Blackthorne, an adventurous explorer who was searching for the Japans in order for him to bring glory to himself when he returns to England, Toranaga, an invincible Japanese warlord who is trying to protect his provinces against his many enemies, and Mariko, a converted Christian who is known for her ability to speak the \\"barbarian\\" languages. The setting of this novel is Japan in the 1400's. There are different conflicts for each character. Blackthorne's main conflict his him finding a way home, Toranaga's is trying hold off his enemies, who reside in Osaka, and Mariko's is that she is married, but has secretly fallen in love with Blackthorne.<br />The pace of the novel is mainly a fast one, but at times can go slow. There is always some event going on that makes you want to keep reading, or read faster. I think that the main characters were all very likeable, he did this by making them either a nice enjoyable person, or through some act that shows their good character.  James Clavell also did a very good job making me detest certain people, such as Ishido, who are Tornaga's enemy. He shows this to you through how when Ishido can't get his way, so he tortures people to get his way. I think that one of the themes of the novel is to never give up. This is shown through Blackthorne, and his persistence to try and get home, even if he has to risk his life. This is shown when Blackthorne's original ship is destroyed, and his first instinct is to rebuild it, even though someone is trying to kill him and burn his ship.<br />I personally thought the book was very good, and would recommend this book to young adults to adult readers, who enjoy a historical-fiction book that is fast paced, but are able to read at a slow pace too. I would say this because there are times in this novel where the action will go on for lengths of 40 to 50, and sometimes even 60 pages, and there are also times when there willbe just dialogue for that amount of time.

B000IFQLLY|4.0|Everything on this CD is great but it's really missing out on the fantastic early stuff.  For the casual fan this is actually a bigger issue than it is for the completists; you probably already own all the albums.

B0024FADDI|5.0|What a riot this movie is.  When I'm feeling the need for a popcorn and beer nuts lollapalooza movie night, I pull out \\"Army of Darkness\\" and invite over my demented friends, neighbors and family for a good laugh.<br /><br />Groovy Bruce is at his kookiest best as Ash, Housewares, S-Mart, battling the Deadites and trying to stay alive in the 1300s, after dropping into the past with his beat up Oldsmobile, his chainsaw prosthesis hand and his Remington shotgun.<br /><br />He fights skeletons carrying swords, saves himself with his chainsaw hand, has a whirlwind romance with Sheila, played by Embeth Davidtz, and just generally drops some of the funniest one-liners ever and works on creating gallons of blood and guts.<br /><br />Looking for a movie that will bring a grin (albeit deranged) to your face? This is it.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|An amazing movie about one of the greatest drivers of all time in the world's most popular motor sport.

B001GZ6QBU|4.0|My youngest son loaned me \\"The Dark Knight\\" DVD months ago. And he asked me at least weekly if I'd watched the movie yet.  I am not a huge Batman fan (I know - boo, hiss) and I had seen prior Batman movies that did nothing to change my opinion.<br /><br />BUT...I really enjoyed this movie.  Everything about it was right - casting, acting, special effects, cinematography.  Well, the storyline wasn't great but everything else made up for the weak storyline.<br /><br />Heath Ledger as the Joker was perfection - dark, tortured, tormented.<br /><br />Christian Bale - the perfect Batman.  I also thought Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal were superb in their roles along with Aaron Eckhart.<br /><br />I loved the special effects - car chases, motorcycle, Batman soaring over Gotham City.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to start listening to both of my sons and their movie recommendations.<br /><br />I got the movie watched just in time.  The sequel \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is due out in July 2012.
0553801473|1.0|Everyone else has already said it and much better than I could ever write.  I've never been so disappointed in a book/series as George RR Martin's. So many strong characters have been lost along with their stories.  What a mess.  I hope HBO can improve upon these books and give us a successful and satisfactory conclusion.

B0000033WC|5.0|Although VU is frequently credited with spawning the \\"punk rock\\" movement, 1970's \\"Loaded\\" isn't too far removed from other great early seventies power pop and even sunshine pop records. The first track \\"Who Loves The Sun\\" would not have been out of place on an early seventies Beach Boys record. Sweet Jane is a track that Lou Reed would utilize in his solo career later on on the live album of VU covers Rock n Roll Animal.  The cool thing about the \\"Fully Loaded\\" expanded edition of the album is that it restores a cool bridge section that ended up being edited out of the original album mix and is availiable here for the first time.  \\"Cool It Down\\" is a great track as well. \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" could be some type of country-rock pastiche of some sort (remember, how big country rock type stuff was in the early seventies). LCB was inspired by a movie Andy Warhol was making at the time about gay cowboys or something. \\"I Found A Reason\\" is an interesting doo wop pastiche, betraying Lou's root's in the late fifties streetcorner doowop scene. Head Held High and Train Round The Ben are two similar tempoe'd rockers that are alright. New Age is a story about a fat blonde actress, which appears on the Live '69 album with a different set of lyrics. New Age is definitely one of the highlights of the album for me. Rock n Roll holds the distinction of being the only VU song I have ever heard on these horrible \\"Classic Rock\\" format FM stations (and I heard it only once-lol-so typical of this crap format that plays Led Zepellin and AC/DC into oblivion but never has given VU a chance! The second disc is a treat too with outtakes of songs that Lou would recycle during the first phase of a 40 year plus solo career: Satellite of Love, Ocean, Ride Into The Sun, and Love Makes You Feel. Also there's an inferior \\"alternate take\\" of Sweet Jane, with an annoying-ass cowbell, courtesy of VU manager/crook Steve Sesnick. Honorable mention goes also to Doug Yule, who did a great job singing lead on New Age, Oh Sweet Nothing, and the bonus outtake on disc 2 'Ride Into The Sun'. I recall reading a review for this back in the nineties when it was released in which Lou Reed  commented that he couldn't imagine that the new release would sell much given the fact that the Velvet Underground was more of a 'cult' thing than an actual popular band. i believe it's  about time we re appraised the significance and influence of this great album.d on New Age, Oh Sweet Nothing, and the bonus outtake on disc 2 'Ride Into The Sun'.

B005COO1X6|5.0|Even with the abrupt ending. At first I didn't like that, but the more I thought about it the less that bothered me. I am a Stephen King devotee, though I didn't like \\"11/22/63\\" or whatever...that one was interesting but I was over it about halfway through. But, I digress, this is my first King short story. What I liked about it was that, just as \\"Salem's Lot\\" opened me to the world of Vampires, \\"Carrie\\" showed me what disastrous effect an abusive parent and school bullying can have on a kid and \\"Christine\\" showed me the possibilities of an evil car ( I could go on)...this story grabbed me from the first page and still hasn't really let me go. It elicited from me all the emotions the long books have. Right to the last page I was on the edge of my seat wondering who would be the next victim. Yes, the magnifying glass and blast off were a little off the wall, but so is SK! I got what I wanted from it...and it had to end somehow....I haven't been able to come up with a better ending!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book as part of my book club selections.  Other than the sex there is nothing else interesting about this book. The three books could have easily been condensed to one.  The plot (if you can call it that) is predictable. Reading it was difficult because it is so poorly written.
B005LAIHIQ|2.0|I think most people can agree that Tim Burton movies have gone downhill in recent years, but I think I tend to enjoy them a bit more than everyone else. While \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" fail in comparison to the likes of \\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", they're still pretty entertaining at face value. \\"Dark Shadows\\" has been rubbing everyone the wrong way ever since that first trailer was released and revealed that the original gothic soap opera from 1966 was now more of a comedic fantasy. Even after viewing the movie, giving a definite opinion of \\"Dark Shadows\\" is still rather difficult.<br /><br />I didn't follow the original series, but I had my doubts about the movie right from the start. Johnny Depp looked really awkward as Barnabas Collins. If you just look at Barnabas, he appears to be an emo Nosferatu. The comedy felt like it didn't belong in a film like this. It was as if Dracula went to the school of slapstick comedy and decided to run around throwing cream pies and squirting everyone in the face with a seltzer water bottle instead of biting them on the neck and either feasting on their blood or turning them into a creature of the night.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is somewhat surprising though. Witnessing the whole McDonalds sponsorship scene was a bit painful, but that scene that takes place where Barnabas awakens in 1972 is when the movie illustrates that it is capable of getting dark and violent. Hell, it may even show a little blood every once in awhile. The humor is very ridiculous throughout, but there are quite a few innuendos and a handful of sex jokes that you may not be expecting. There's an entire conversation revolving around balls, a scene where Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) goes down on Barnabas, a pair of panties being shoved and left in Barnabas' face for an extended period of time, and one of the most awkward sex scenes to be released on the big screen that is even more \\"regrettable\\" than Barnabas says it is.<br /><br />Most of the humor that hits its mark the most involves the outdated speaking method that Barnabas uses. His fascination with \\"fertile birthing hips,\\" the way he keeps referring to Alice Cooper as a hideous woman, and his fantastically longwinded insults are easily the highlight of the character. Chloe Grace Moretz is fairly entertaining, as well. That could just be because she reminds me of my cousin who wishes she was born in the seventies, but her screen time certainly didn't feel like it was wasted.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is this really bizarre excuse of a movie. Some moments are pretty funny and others are fairly clever, but that's where the movie's charm ends. Everything is overly goofy, ridiculous, and too over the top to be completely coherent. Imagine trying to mix a fruit salad and a garden salad. That weird concoction is pretty much what \\"Dark Shadows\\" is to the film world. The fantastical comedy isn't really good or downright awful, but you can't really describe it as anything other than \\"meh.\\" Despite some interesting performances from the entire cast, everything just feels kind of thrown together without much chemistry or purpose.is even more \\"regrettable\\" than Barnabas says it is.<br /><br />Most of the humor that hits its mark the most involves the outdated speaking method that Barnabas uses.

0345803507|1.0|I could only manage to read 70 pages into book 3 and was so beyond bored and annoyed that I couldn't stand it anymore! So I skimmed the rest since I really hate to leave a book unfinished. At this point, if I ever read or hear the phases \\"peeked/glanced/or looked up through his/her long lashes\\" I might literally vomit! The exact same phrases and words are repeated throughout the book and are increasingly obnoxious. Seriously, does this author not know what a thesaurus is?!?! Even the sex scenes were boring and tiresome due to the poorly chosen idioms and the authors' use of the EXACT SAME terminology. Oh- and the fact that somehow every single time Christian and Ana have sex they come together- oh puh-leeze! That is beyond unrealistic and utterly exasperating.<br /><br />Additionally, somehow in the time span of, oh let's say, about 6 months all of the following happens: a bdsm, insanely rich, and maddeningly handsome dominate falls for a boring, naive virgin who only partially refuses to be his submissive (and gives in on a lot of things only because \\"omg Christian is sooooo hot!\\" Ugh!), works out all of his crack whore/dead mommy and pimp beating issues (issues he hasn't been able to work out his entire life thus far), discovers the true colors of his ex-lover, finds love, and marries- and to make things worse, lets throw in every possible scenario that can ever happen in any book ever written and then end it with Ana and Christian having a baby together... Yea, that was boring.<br /><br />It's as though the author had too many thoughts and way too many ideas and crammed them all into this horribly written trilogy. The overuse of simple words and phrases was enough to make me hate this book, and don't even get me started on the grammar! I am thoroughly disgusted by this pathetic excuse for a literary work of art and quite frankly a fifth grader could construct better sentences than those that are published in this book! I can not believe that all 3 of these are best sellers- that says a lot about the American population.<br /><br />If you want a good erotica novel, bypass this series and read Anne Rice's Beauty trilogy, published under her pen name A.N. Roquelaure... and if you don't want an erotica, still bypass this series and read ANY other book you can think of- hell, my calc 2 book from college was more interesting than this!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first heard about it, I was the least bit thrilled; but with all the hype i decided \\"why not\\"...needless to say I was captured immediately...this book is spell bounding, intriguing, electrifying, and tantalizingly GREAT!!! Through shock, laughter, tears, & joy I read the entire TRIOLOGY...I am now Fifty Shades stimulated, if you will.
0345803493|1.0|When I ordered this series, I bought all three books. When I finished reading the first one I was completely disappointed, it was not at all what I was expecting it to be, and it was not really an erotica novel. However, I did not want to give it a horrible review, maybe it was just because I was expecting something more along the lines of Anne Rice's Beauty series. So I decided to be open minded about book 2, I had already bought it anyway.<br /><br />Even with an open mind, I struggled while reading this poorly written book with less than appealing characters. Ana Steele is a one-dimensional moron who is worse than Bella Swan as portrayed by Kristen Stewart in the Twilight movies (Bella Swan in the books is far more developed than Ana Steele, and that's saying a lot!).<br /><br />So now I still have book 3, since I purchased them all together, and am not the least bit interested in reading it. Boring book, over used words and sayings, poorly constructed sentences, horribly boring sex scenes, and lacking in a truly defined plot. Can this get any worse?? What a waste of time and a waste of money

I'm certain that most people wouldn't have issues with wearing this out. It is very well made and extremely useful to me. I have a BJ city select and use it daily during the warmer months. It fits many different sized sippy cups or mommy cups and even keeps drinks cool with insulated fabric(think soda can cozy). I would buy this again and again! I think I definitely got my moneys worth out of it for 2 years and know I'll be using this one for at least another 2.

B0058Z4NR8|5.0|To an economist like me, reading Why Nations Fail, by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, is akin to being set free from shackles worn since I began studying. However, first let me say that the book has many and serious shortcomings. Let me talk about these before I get into why this book set me free. Since I am going to strongly criticize aspects of the book, let me make clear that this is one of the best books on economics I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Several criticisms have been leveled in other reviews against this book: it is simplistic and perhaps overly ambitious, the history is bad, it explains away competing explanations. They are all true.<br /><br />The book is undoubtedly simplistic.  Basically, the authors state that the institutions of a nation or society can be placed on a one dimensional continuum running from \\"extractive\\" to \\"inclusive\\" and this explains the history of humanity from the neolithic to the present day. A second leitmotif is that the economic and political institutions complement each other and that economically inclusive but politically extractive institutions cannot last for long (as well as the opposite). Finally, since political and economic institutions reinforce each other, they are quite difficult to change, leading to what the authors call \\"the iron law of oligarchy.\\"  Needless to say, this really oversimplifies the analysis of institutions and history. While Acemoglu and Robinson give many, many historical examples to illustrate their thesis, some are more convincing than others.  They use a huge mallet to hammer all the facts into their mold, either ignoring or re-interpreting contrary evidence.<br /><br />I am no historian, but I do know the history of the region in which I live, Latin America, reasonably well.  When Latin American examples were used in the book, they were shallow and even wrong. For example, the authors talk quite a bit about the establishment of indigenous \\"serfdom\\", with terrible extractive institutions such as the encomienda and repartimiento, in much of Hispanic America. I agree the story they tell is quite important but they do not get it quite right.  Acemoglu and Robinson tell the tale of these institutions as if they were simply set in place by colonizing Spaniards when the truth was much more complex, involving conflicts and constant negotiation between the Spanish colonizers, the Spanish Crown, and the conquered peoples themselves. The colonizers wanted to set up slavery instead of serfdom but were impeded from doing so by the Crown through the Leyes Nuevas. The story is told marvelously well in La Patria del Criollo by Severo Martinez Pelaez. The funny thing is that the correct narrative would fit well into the inclusive-extractive framework with a richness that comes from putting in two groups of elite actors with divergent interests, but Acemoglu and Robinson tell it so simplistically so as to miss out.<br /><br />Likewise, the authors analyze, in different points of the book, Colombia and Brazil, with exceptional praise for Brazilian institutions while they heap abuse upon the Colombian ones. Brazil at the present time has, evidently, better institutions than a Colombia only (we hope) beginning to emerge from decades of civil war. But these two countries are much more alike than different. If you believe the tale told by Acemoglu and Robinson, they could have been comparing Japan and Burma, and not two  nations with similar history, GDP, and institutions. While Colombia has seen many horrors and has a long road to travel, recent progress in reigning in lawlessness and chaos is undeniable. While Brazil has seen amazing institutional progress in the last fez decades, many of its cities suffer with murder rates higher than those of Colombian cities, de facto slave labor can be still found in some areas, and its income and especially property distributions are still among the most unequal in Latin America.  Especially jarring is that, in other partsof the book, the authors place great emphasis on when institutions limit executive power, giving as an example the American system's unwillingness to allow FDR to pack the Supreme Court to get his way. The same happened in Colombia when Alvaro Uribe passed legislation allowing him to run for a third term and the Supreme Court shot it down with the broad support of Colombian society, including Uribe's allies.<br /><br />The same can be said of their analysis of Mexico and Argentina: maybe not wrong, but terribly shallow. I know little of the Glorious Revolution, the Roman Empire, the Meiji Restoration, the history of Botswana, or much else of what the book is based upon. But if the standard is the same as the their Latin American examples, then much of the book based upon is poor history. In defense of the authors, it is difficult to draw the details with finesse when painting with a broad brush and the history of humanity from the neolithic to present day is about as broad as you can get in the social sciences.<br /><br />A final criticism is that Acemoglu and Robinson do not give competing explanations for the backwardness of nations the credit they deserve. They explain away rather than seek dialogue. They classify competing explanations into the Geography Hypothesis, the Culture Hypothesis, and the Ignorance Hypothesis. One problem is that they ignore other competing explanations that go from scientific knowledge (see Margaret Jacob's Scientific Culture and the Making of the Industrial West) to various Marxist explanations based upon capital accumulation. While Acemoglu and Robinson obviously admire Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel - which is very well-argued \\"geography is destiny\\" book - they ignore other important proponents of the Geography Hypothesis such as Kenneth Pommeranz. I feel their case would be made stronger if they argued that the two approaches were complementary and not adversarial. A relation between geography, technology, political institutions, and economic institutions would be a much stronger theory than institutions alone.<br /><br />With regards to the Culture Hypothesis, they are (I believe) correct in criticizing it for being so fluid as to be virtually without content. But here my take is not entirely neutral as I particularly loathe the Culture Hypothesis.<br /><br />But it is on the Ignorance Hypothesis that Acemoglu and Robinson fire their cannon with relish. Being intelligent economists in contact with the intellectual world of \\"development\\" I am sure they are very frustrated at the arrogance of policy advisors from the likes of the World Bank, United Nations, or IMF who believe they have the solution to all the developing world's problems \\"if only policymakers would listen to them.\\"  I am not unsympathetic to their disgust at these people but I think Acemoglu and Robinson throw the baby away with the dirty bath water. History is just too full of examples of disastrous policies (disastrous for those who implemented them, not only for the poor souls who inhabit their countries) for the Ignorance Hypothesis to be dismissed out of hand. The authors blame almost all, if not all, bad policies on the material interests of the elite whose position would be endangered by good policy.<br /><br />A more subtle, and, in my opinion, much more serious, problem is that knowledge and interests are not independent.  It is one thing for the elite to choose bad (bad for the many) policy if that policy can be dressed up in plausible and attractive intellectual robes and quite another if that policy is seen as nothing more than plundering of the many by the few (see Antonio Gramsci on role of the intellectual in allowing policy agendas to go forward or not). The \\"economic nationalism\\" that has destroyed so many African, Latin American, and Middle Eastern economies is not just pure extraction of wealth of the many by the few; it also dressed in a coherent economic theory espoused by a host of intelligent sociologists and economists (for a popular, if somewhat limited exposition, see The Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano). This is why dismissal of the Ignorance Hypothesis is so dangerous: not only is knowledge power, but economic theories that are on your side are also power.<br /><br />So the book has quite a few shortcomings. Why did I like it so much?<br /><br />Because as economists we are taught from course one that you cannot have your cake and eat it too. The trade-off between efficiency and equity has been fed to us since before we were weaned. The result to an economist very interested in equality such as myself are intellectual shackles that hobble and cripple our thinking.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson show us that in the real world, not some paretian maximum efficiency world, but the real one full of monopolies and other horrendous extractive institutions, there is no such trade-off. Equity is efficiency. Only egalitarian institutions allow for the full creative potential of people to be unleashed and thus only egalitarian institutions allow for boundless, unlimited growth based upon technology and productivity. There may be an equity-efficiency trade-off in Sweden or Norway, but certainly not in Mexico, Brazil, Haiti, Zimbabwe, or Pakistan. Much of this has been around in different guises since Schumpeter (who the authors cite extensively) and, more recently, in the endogenous growth literature, but nowhere has it been as clearly stated as in Why Nations Fail.<br /><br />Why Nations Fail not only states this as its official position but, in spite of all its shortcomings, argues the point so well so as to be entirely convincing (at least to me). The fact that the authors get much of the history not quite right and that they fight rather than incorporate \\"competing\\" explanations does not reduce importance of the book and its central message. The sheer optimism of its viewpoint is as liberating as the Emancipation Proclamation.
0307959856|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about taking classic novels and speculating about how the lives of the characters would've played out.  This book is no exception and it is really unusual for an author like P.D. James to undertake such a story as this.  I always associate her with the Adam Dalgliesh mysteries which are contemporary and this just doesn't seem to be her style!  There have been other authors that have attempted the same thing of trying to incorporate the Jane Austen characters into other novels and for me it just doesn't work.  I did like the way the book started where she gave a synopsis of Pride and Prejudice and reviewed the characters.  I also liked the historical points of how a manor house like Pemberley was organized and how the staff accommodated the Darcys and guests.  The rest of the plot involving Wickham and Denny, hysterical Lydia, Col. Fitzwilliam Darcy, and various others was a bit too dramatic and almost unbelievable.  I just feel that this isn't the author's best work and wouldn't recommend this book to friends.  Read the Adam Dalgliesh books.  They are much more interesting and intriguing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sad to see such unkind reviews.  I truly loved this book and could hardly put it down.  Now it might not be for everyone but I really enjoyed the characters and story.  And many of my friends are reading along side me and we have been enjoying discussing the book so much.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|very good game but it freezes up and wont let you visit other peoples villages or it says that you don't have Internet connection
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First and foremost, I don't write reviews - this is a first for me. That isn't because I have never read a book worthy of praise (or panning) but rather the fact that most of the authors I have enjoyed reading (such as Heinlein) are dead, and would not benefit greatly from anything I may have to say.<br /><br />Fortunately such is not the case with Hugh Howey which hopefully means that there will be much more to come from this exciting young author.<br /><br />So what should I say about \\"Wool\\"? As most readers know there are 3 important aspects to good Science Fiction, now remember I said \\"Science\\" Fiction not Fantasy - no magic swords or rings or magicians or unicorns here, but good hard science fiction.  Those are 1) Character depth 2) Plot complexity and 3) Believability of concept.  Okay, maybe those are MY three important aspects to a good Science Fiction novel, but I digress.  In all of the above, Hugh Howey excels.  I found myself rooting for the hero's and wishing the villains a violent and painful death. The plot unraveled nicely with plenty of twists and turns along the way to hold one's interest. The \\"Last folks on Earth\\" genre has been done by many, but none with more of a flair for the subject that invokes both the science of the day, the plausibility of the future and also intertwines politics in a way that reminded me of Robert Heinlein and \\"Starship Troopers\\" among others.<br /><br />Is Howey in that class? My advice is to read his books and form your own opinion. Howey is also the author of the very well received \\"Molly Fyde\\" series.  If I were you I would grab the Wool Omnibus while it is still available for this ridiculously low price - it can't stay there forever - nor should it!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome my first kindle mest up by playing it to much at least that is what the people who sent me a free one said
B00170MYIS|3.0|I was in need of a replacement battery for my Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W55. I purchased the \\"NP-FGI\\" (InfoLithium) battery because according to all the data I was able to retrieve the battery should have extended communication capabilities with the camera and instead of a mere battery Icon showing battery condition I should have had an actual read-out of the time left on the battery till it required recharging. Unfortunately, that was incorrect and the updated battery works exactly as the older non-InfoLithium model. Someone has their data incorrect. Sony said the battery should allow extended communication capability with the camera but that is not true and the regular NP-FG1 would have worked just as well given the battery indicator worked exactly as it did with the older less expensive battery.<br />Regarding Digi Acc Customer Service: It was perfect, and the item was received on time, undamaged, in perfect working order as promised.<br />Save for the inability of Sony to understand its own products and what functions will and will not work, the sale went off without a hitch and the company (Digi Acc) deserves a *5 star* rating with Sony garnering 3 stars for not being capable of  giving correct information to the purchaser.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was initially intrigued with the reviews and hooplah surrounding \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"  It was on Ellen, and other various shows, touting its \\"visionary\\" empowerment of women.  All I got out of it was the following;  If you are thin and pretty, shy and demure and a virgin, you may be able to snag a rich white guy that will change all his dastardly ways to make you happy.  This is not new, nor is it empowering.  It is the classic story of codependency.  And believe me, bad boys don't come to heel this easily!
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Game of Thrones may seem a bit slow at the start, with few hints at what is coming for the cast as the story progresses. Each sub plot is well defined, whilst not straying far from the original story. The plot of the season has left a few loose ends in the Finale episode, leaving few things shrouded in mystery. One would assume after the first episode that this story is fantasy based, as one will learn through the series the fantasy aspect prefers to stay hidden while hinting at it from the shadows of the plot. In addition, the series plot (though I have only watched this and have yet to read the book series) I can only assume will lead us into a mythical world. If the series does continue it could either be great, or it could fall to pieces such as almost all other fantasy derived shows today. In Short I am doubtful of it continuing to be done well, since the topic is a hard one to pull off. Of course it has far more potential than many shows before it that have tried to pull of this genre, luckily its based on a legit series.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great Acting<br />Wonderful Cast<br />Slightly delving into a Mythical World<br />Well developed plot<br />Secrets<br />Based on a Series of Books<br />Exciting<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not many in my eyes except a few minor points that most would be considered spoilers....

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Over rated and disappointing.  There is too much lip biting and not enough story to bite into.  A ridiculous book.  If you feel compelled to read the series - go to the library.  The trilogy isn't worth 30 cents.

B007DJUO8O|4.0|I'm confused by some people saying this is not music.<br />Of course it is! In fact, there are some very beautiful melodies to be found here.<br />Yes, Storm Corrosion does not rock. It's not supposed to. It's gentle, airy, and occasionally dark. I do think it was over-hyped, as it's not that different. If you are a fan of No-Man or early Porcupine Tree such as Up The Downstair, you should appreciate this effort.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's not perfect. It feels more like an appetizer rather than a full-course meal. That's the analogy that comes to mind. It teases the ears quite well, but doesn't quite fully satisfy. I wonder if this had been released before Grace For Drowning, if I would have appreciated it more, because that album was a masterpiece and may have spoiled me. Storm Corrosion is really very good, though, and certainly superior to Opeth's Heritage, which I found to be emotionless and boring.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|fascinating era, compelling drama, outstanding acting, and beautiful scenery.  writing, however, suffers from lack of continuity or focus on how characters are developed.  the two main lovers from the upper crust are just too coy and indecisive to be believable.  cousin matthew's miraculous recovery needed to be explained better-- either the product of some significant medical advance; or, even better, the miraculous providence of God.  the very brief \\"affair\\" of the head of household with his servant was was way too sudden to materialize to be believable; and way too abrupt in ending.  the cruelty/devastating effect on such an otherwise stable relationship deserves more development.

0451205766|5.0|Is it possible to have both the romantic view of family and trust together with the realist portrayal of death and conflict?  Mario Puzo writes a riveting novel that masterfully displays both romantic and realistic views in the original family mafia story. To most people, this contradiction wouldn't make any sense, but it is exactly this tension that makes the novel so great.<br />The book describes the story of an Italian family that moves to the United States and forms their empire known as the Corleone Family. Nothing is more important than the protection and wellbeing of the family. To go along with this, the Corleones focus on very strict ethics carried over from when the family lived in Italy. Loyalty, friendship, and relationships are all core values of the mighty Corleone Family. The family runs strictly on trust, looking down on the current American society and the government and instead chooses to revert back to their Italian traditions. Homemade dinners, traditional marriages, good deeds and religion are common motifs found throughout the book. If you're a woman that loves to read about family, relationships and good ethics this is the book for you, however men, don't get too discouraged.<br />To contrast the romantic view discussed above, Puzo includes the struggles that the family endures at the same time. Gory battles between the mob families, the death of many characters, as well as the gruesome thoughts of the characters give the reader a realistic feeling that keeps them guessing what will happen next. Being the strongest mafia family in the United States, the Corleones have many enemies. With these enemies come many problems. The reader's insight into the Don's decision- making keeps the book both interesting and exciting. I could not put the book down. Just when the male readers are ready to put the book down because they thought it was a family oriented story, Puzo surprises them with the gore and action needed to satisfy their pleasure.<br />Whether you prefer romantic novels or action-packed thrillers, Mario Puzo's novel, The Godfather is the right book for you. Do yourself a favor and buy this book immediately. You will not be disappointed.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved this book (and the next two). I fell in love with the characters, especially Mr. Grey. :) I found myself thinking about the characters all day. I am surprised it got such mixed reviews, however, if your looking for a love story with some erotic romance, I think you'll love this book. I wish there was more, and I'm sad I'm done reading it.
1401216676|3.0|Okay so I bought this years ago when it first came out on paperback.  Love the story and my favorite comic. However I do have a big problem with this update. I hate the colors they added to this new update. When you compare the 2 the older paperback ones the colors look fantastic and really emphasize the feelings and passion of this story. The new updated one  loses that. Basically look at the old pictures and compare it with the new one. Storys the same, just looks different.
0345803493|5.0|I'm not sure which of the three is my favorite, but I loved them all. I'm sad I'm done reading them, and I wish there were more.

B001DJLD1M|4.0|This is without doubt an outstanding, breathtaking movie.  But I don't understand why no one mentions 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'.  Humans, being used as batteries by intellegent robots, dates back to the 1960's.  And revisited again, in a new way, decades later...again in 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'.  I'm not putting the movies down, but the concept isn't as original as most imply.  I would find it VERY difficult to believe that the comics did NOT inspire the movies to some degree.  But I endorse BOTH.  Please, read the comic.  The brief older storyline, and the much longer one decades later.  It's ALL good, just different twists on the same topic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very entertaining allegory for what is happening with politics in the U.S.  Kept my interest throughout, although it gets a little more extreme with each book (i.e. Hunger Games book 1 is really good, book 2 is not quite as good but pretty good, book 3 start to get a little far out.)
B004RE29PO|5.0|Who doesn't enjoy this movie? It's got everything you want. Sci-fi setting, big guns, creepy aliens, and of course lots of action! Plus you get to hear one of the best one liners in a movie...\\"Game over man! Game over!\\" The first Alien and this movie are the best of the series. If you haven't seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and check it out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this book for my little brother and decided to get the kindle version to read along with him. While I don't think some of the themes in the book are for middle school aged kids as they say it is, the book was beautifully written. Some people think it was written for the movies but, the movie (which was OK) really didnt do the book justice. It's important that we READ. My mental image of all the horrors of the arena, the dresses Cena made, even the woods where they hunted, were far more vivd than any movie could produce. I loved this book, and read the next two at a neck-breaking pace. I read the Hunger Games Trilogy faster than the HP books, which is really saying something. Kudos Ms. Collins.

B000P2A3WI|5.0|I found this book to be outstanding, mostly because the author did something that is somewhat difficult to get accepted by the literary world... he used multiple points of view. It is typical (and most accepted, as per literary agents and publishers) for a novel to have only 1 or 2 POVs. Hornby wrote this story with each of the characters having their direct POV shared with the reader; he even titled each chapter with the character's name. As a writer, I find this to be an amazing \\"coloring outside the lines\\" type of endeavor. With my own novel that I'm currently working on, the format is similar to this novel, therefore I can speak from experience in stating that the multiple POV format is truly difficult. In Hornby's novel, this format is not only employed, but it is done to perfection (in my opinion) and actually adds quite a lot of depth to the stories of each individual character as well as the collective storyline of the group, tying the entire story together quite effectively.<br /><br />The format is clearly my favorite feature of this novel, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to delve into something unique. But I also loved this story for the plot and the difficulty in making a profoundly disturbing issue (suicide) something that the reader can relate to while getting a bunch of laughs in the meantime. Again, I highly recommend this novel, especially for people who enjoy stories that do not take the most likely or accepted path.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|This CD is awesome, Nicki Minaj is wondersful. I listened to it for a week straight when I first recieved it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is an alright series, if you know what you are getting into.  I am so glad I was able to read a few chapters before purchasing, because I would never pay money for this book.  It made a great bath book (a book I can read in snippits because the plot is just that bad, it doesn't really matter). Something that has some parts you would fantasize about.  I'm not sure, however, how it got to the bestseller's list.  Seriously, if you want to read it, don't pay anymore than you would for any other tawdry romance novel, such as harliquin. And I can readily find them at thrift stores for a quarter or less.<br /><br />On another note, I really do think that some kind of warning should be put on it, because as others have said, anybody could pick this up.  Including that middle-schooler who is a little advanced in reading and wants to try something new.  It's not as explicit as some books I have read, but does need to be placed in the erotica section.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Being one who frequently is reminded of their geek status (when my phone rings and reveals its Star Wars theme or I quote The Lord of the Rings to my coworkers), I found relating to the story easy.<br />I loved the references to movies and games I grew up with.  The main character at a number of different points in the story made me say &#34;Yeah, I've done that&#34; or &#34;I feel the same way&#34;.<br />This, along with the other great points it has to offer made it a great read.<br />I do not though think you have to be stuck in the 80s to enjoy the book. The story does not rely on nostalgia. It is exciting, emotional and thought provoking all at the same time.<br />I recommned giving the book a try even if the 80s have no special meaning to you.  You will find yourself well entertained, even if the book does not speak to you as it did to mr.
B000ZN802W|1.0|I would give this thing a half-star, but Amazon does not give us that option. Anyway...<br /><br />Pure garbage. Well, not entirely pure. There is some good acting, decent cinematography, a believable storyline (well, of course, since it is based on a true story, however wretched, moronic, and uninteresting), and a moral (see my title for this review).<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />But it's like this: I think the whole reason to write, act, paint, sculpt, sing, dance, etc., is to create art. Interesting art. Something that moves, entertains, takes you on a journey to \\"somewhere i have never traveled\\", or even makes you think. I'm struggling to see how this movie fits even the most rudimentary elements of that definition.<br /><br />I repeat: wow.<br /><br />Why would I give rat's left testicle about this dude, who chucks everything (family, friends, education, his car), just so he could \\"prove\\" something to himself(?) by living in the wild? And this dubious endeavor means what, exactly, to me? Honestly, why would anyone care to watch some grandiose, narcissistic, self-absorbed, inadequately prepared individual attempt a not totally foolhardy or unachievable quest, knowing all the while (even to himself) that he is going to die a forgotten, stupid, and unnecessary death?<br /><br />I don't judge here. \\"Live and let live\\", I always say, and if you want to be unintelligent, moronic, suicidal, even evil, more power to you! Just keep that crap to yourself (I guess keeping evil to yourself would be difficult, as you would probably need an agent upon which or whom to enact it in order for it to become tenable), and don't expect me to care.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />(I once saw, in the infomercial hours of the night, an \\"Extreme\\" program on television. Among the lowlights of enacted human idiocy, I watched as 12 individuals, wrapped around and fastened at the waist by the same bungee cord, took off en masse from a mast on a ship traveling 30 knots. Predictably, the bungee cord snapped, and 12 imbeciles hit the water -- which at this speed is like hitting a wall -- with arms flailing, limbs cracked, blood pouring from all orifices, etc., crying for help. Really. I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? I mean, what were they thinking? Unbelievable! I guess, just like the imagination and human aspiration, stupidity knows no bounds.)<br /><br />But if you like your poison served up this way, here's another pointless thing to watch: \\"Open Water\\".
B007JRU2UK|5.0|A lot of people don't like this movie because of the way the daughters spoke to their father. NEWS FLASH!: That's how MOST kids talk to their parents now and the people who are angry at it are probably the ones that live their lives that way. Don't act like it's not happening! I didn't like it, but that's how parents are raising their kids to talk to them now and they're all in denial like they have these really good kids. That's one of the reasons why I was able to watch it and enjoy it because it was showing people for what they truly are.<br /><br />So many movies try and gloss over people's actual personalities and try and come across like the Cleavers, but most families are far far from anything like that. And so are people. Get over it and stop acting like it doesn't happen because it does.<br /><br />Now, as far as this movie goes, I liked it because it was different, but I loved it because of the acting and the writing. I loved it because it was shot beautifully. And I loved it because it told so many different stories in 2 hours. I just thought it was being truthful. Everyone wants to act as if mothers are just the best when it comes to movies, that they don't screw up, that they're strong now and beautiful and we're all going to die loved. That's just not true. People might love you and despise you all at the same time.<br /><br />I loved this film, but I can understand how some people may not get it and I can't knock them for that. But this deserved all the attention it got in my opinion.

I love it when a book or books come along that make you want to miss sleep no matter what you have to accomplish the next day.  I am an avid reader and read about a book every day or two.  It has been a few months since I've come across one that I couldn't put down.  It was very well written.  Look forward to seeing more from this author.

B00006GA48|5.0|I really hate the term classic rock, but what else are you gonna call \\"CTH\\" ? It's rock, alright, and it's totally classic, in the best sense of the word. I own everything GFR has ever done on both vinyl and CD. This record was a great follow-up to their best record, which came out a mere 6 months earlier. That would be \\"Grand Funk\\", also known as \\"the red album\\". But \\"CTH\\" is about 95% as good, and still qualifies with five stars. The additional live tracks are incredible, and make this \\"must\\" listening for even a casual GFR fan.

0786838655|4.0|My introduction to the Percy Jackson series was through watching the movie for this book, which piqued my interest enough to get me to read it.  Good job movie!!!<br /><br />The first thing that struck me not too far into the book was how much the movie varied from the original work.  After reading the whole thing, this disappointed me quite a bit, because there were a lot of pretty cool scenes in the book that I would have loved to see on screen.  I assume that was done to fit the movie into standards that work for the target audience, but it would have been so awesome to see some of these explosions and fights!<br /><br />This book does a lot to set up potential future conflicts, feeding into the continuation of the series, but in a subtle way that makes you enjoy it more than if it were blatantly obvious that a series was the goal.  Percy is a character that you want to see succeed, he's a great, yet misunderstood, kid and it's obvious that he's going to mature into an interesting teenager.  His character alone makes me want to continue reading the series!<br /><br />I also loved that this combined something we know a bit about, Greek mythology, with the modern world we're familiar with.  To a large extent, the magic I felt while reading this book rivaled how I felt for Harry Potter when I first started reading that - with the notable exception that I found Harry to be somewhat annoying in his younger years and I didn't get that with Percy.<br /><br />One thing that did confuse me was why the Gods thought Percy had stolen the lightning bolt...sure, they could claim motivations from his father, but don't they have better logs of who has visited them?  Couldn't they have just looked at the visitors from the day the bolt went missing and figure out from there?<br /><br />I really liked the fact that Percy had to visit the Oracle pretty early on, and learn what the prophecy meant from there.  Although I've seen the movie, there were some surprises due to the deviation from the book (the Oracle itself), so there were a few things I was totally not expecting!  I liked this more realistic approach to how this world might go - there are going to be all kinds of people/monsters/whatever interfering in Percy's life, larger scale things that no one knows about or can predict.  I'm not going to spoil things for anyone, but I can definitely say that I liked the more intricate workings of the villains in this book, and the larger story line they are building up to.<br /><br />This is a series I am eager to continue reading, and I plan to pick up the next book as soon as it fits into my schedule!n from the book (the Oracle itself), so there were a few things I was totally not expecting!

B003Y7L5W8|5.0|O.M.D. at their glorious best even after all these years, every fan should have this on their collection.<br />  Every song in here has all the trademarks synthesizers from their beginnings - Organisation, Architecture and Morality, Dazzle Ships but taken to the next level plus the big drum/bass sounds of their more commercially driven Crush, Sugar Tax, Liberator albums.<br />  History of Modern parts 1 and 2 are the classics.<br />  Sometimes is lovely with that choral background and the back-up vocals has a bit of a Macy Gray sound to her.<br />  Pulse is just absolutely naughty and funky, reminds me of the song - White Horse by Laid Back/Touch It by Monifah.<br />  The Right Side is another classic gem.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Loved the series overall but this book seem to be different. It was dark and brutal almost all the way through unlike the others books which had more lighter everyday parts.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|Good story, full of suspense, mystery, and intrigue. But, a bit too long. 100 pages could have easily been shaven from the end and the story would have retained it's thrill. I was ready for the story to end by the time I reached page 500. Nevertheless, the story is full of action and totally unpredictable. You never could tell who was against who and who were the good guys. The introduction of nano-technology added an interesting dynamic that does make one think of it's potential reality in today's terrorist-laden world we live. Overall, a good read, but just a bit too long.
0385534639|2.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" offers readers a thoroughly imaginative tale of magic, illusion, enchantment and star-crossed lovers.  Erin Morgenstern, as a first-time author, proves her ability to spin a tale most readers would be taken away with, as proved by the number of enthusiastic reviews.  She presents a fantastic tale with enough style and pinache to make the novel a truly engaging work.  The problem, however, is that she lacks the technical skills needed to make the book worthy.<br /><br />This novel reads more like a first draft than a completed work, and I am surprised Morgenstern's editor didn't work with her to edit and restructure this book.  Despite what most reviewers have posted, the novel lacks narrative structure.  Chapters last four pages at most and most of them add nothing to the plot.  \\"The Night Circus\\" is an overpopulated book, with too many characters who don't stand out in any meaningful way.  Morgenstern takes no time to make these characters real to readers.  Also, she has no gift for dialogue; the characters talk too much and what they say is stagey jibber-jabber one would hear in a dime store paperback written sixty years ago.  Rather than spend so much time fixating on minute details or rhapsodizing about the sheer perfection of the circus, its concessions, the Midnight Dinners and her characters' attire, Morgenstern should have worked harder to condense this lengthy book and build dramatic tension.  Also, learning how to use a semicolon wouldn't hurt: the novel is littered with comma splices and run-on sentences.<br /><br />While I admire Morgenstern's zeal (she is clearly enraptured with this by-gone era, with magic and the possibilities of imagination) this alone can't make a novel readable.  Speculative fiction, like all literature, must remain grounded to keep readers invested.  We can only coast along on somersaulting kittens, cloud mazes, chocolate mice and illusionists' slight-of-hand for so long.  Despite words to the contrary, the spell Morgenstern casts in this novel isn't powerful enough to satisfy readers.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|I purchased this headset new and the quality was amazing. Now after only a month my headset does not play as loud as it did when I purchased it. I unplugged it from the USB port one night and upon plugging it back in I noticed the difference in sound. The hassle I would have to deal with to have them fixed under warranty is almost not worth it. The sound still comes in good, but after only a month the sound is not as loud. I am not looking forward to seeing what happens to this product in two months.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think the name of this book should have been Fifty Shades of RED, because that is the range of colors I turned while reading it.<br /><br />50 Shades of Grey is an addicting, intoxicating novel about Ana (an innocent, slightly sheltered, recent college grad) and Christian (an intense, extremely handsome, arrogant millionaire) who are drawn to each other in an irresistible way. The story gripped me from the beginning and I found myself very fond of both of the main characters.<br /><br />However...BE WARNED. 50% of the story is graphic and intense sex (S&M). If this book were a movie, it would be considered porn. In fact, I don't know HOW they are making a movie of this that will get played in the theaters unless they downplay A LOT.<br /><br />Also, be prepared to read the whole trilogy. I have already downloaded the 2nd on my Kindle, though I'm not sure I should want to read it. But, I do. I'm just going to give myself a day or two reprieve before I dive in again. Did I mention this novel was intense?

B0079XNWQA|5.0|i was watching tavis smiley interview jason mraz recently about his new album \\"love is a four letter word\\" and i was quite impressed. (the interview aired on may 2, 2012 on pbs.) jason talked about how the cover of his album is really just a collection of images and shapes that he found and then put together to form the word \\"love.\\" by doing so, mraz shows how love is a choice and that we should choose to see love in all situations. smiley then played a clip of mraz's new hit \\"i won't give up on you.\\" i urge you to google or youtube it and watch it. i found it to be a rather honest and inclusive video matching the intentions of the song. if i had to use two words to describe jason mraz and his music it would be inclusive and inspirational. during the tavis smiley interview, mraz also explained that he got his start as a regular musician in the coffee houses of the san diego, california area. in fact, mraz says that he still performs at these san diego coffee houses for the love of it and also to \\"test out\\" his music before he publishes his work. unfortunately, i am not familiar with san diego but mraz did say that he still can be seen performing in coffee houses around the hillside street area. if you are ever in the area, i urge you to try to catch mraz live. what i love about mraz is the fact that his music is for all people- young and old. i mean if mraz is performing live at a coffee house, where anyone can walk in off the street and give their two-cent opinions, you know mraz has to be good. even if people are just buying a cup of coffee, the crowd will definitely tell you what they think. for a musician like mraz to still be around and in high demand, it shows what a talent and good-hearted individual he truly is. i really like mraz and his music. he is broadening people's minds in an uplifting, beneficial and artistic way. i urge you to purchase this album, your whole family won't regret it. enjoy!

0345803485|5.0|Never have written a review, this one book I felt I needed to comment.<br />An excellent and well written book. I love the plots and could not put this one down. To me, it felt like 'Twilight Saga', written by Stephanie Meyers, only erotic. I have only read one other erotica series which was written by Anne Rice called 'Beauty and the Beast'. I really do not know what the fuss is about this book, the book stores can certainly rate it for over 18 yrs and then card the customers. Taking it off the shelves only creates more people to want to read it. I do hope that Hollywood takes notice and makes a film series. These books need to make it to the big screen. Highly recommended, be sure to have your dictionary handy. She uses words not commonly used here in America.
145470246X|5.0|It doesn't matter what page you turn to in this book because each one has something fabulous on it!  In the authors introduction she begins with the line \\"I want to \\"infect\\" you with my obsession with beads\\" and I can honestly say that once you've flipped through the pages of this book you will not only be infected but inspired and excited by the jewelry projects in it.  The book opens with a chapter on Supplies and Techniques and then moves into \\"Embellished Bases\\".  This chapter includes jewelry that is based on right angle weave but the author has modified it so that the final results look completely different from that stitch.  The jewelry in Chapter 3 is all created using Bezeled Stones and in Chapter 4 the focus is on architecture and answers the question of how to prevent a beaded structure from collapsing when there is nothing to fill the center, stabilizing a piece so it keeps it shape and the changes that transform a ring to a bangle to a square and Pearls or round beads are covered in Chapter 5.<br /><br />The final chapter of this book is \\"Sabination Nation, or how one beader approaches design\\".  Here the author gives the reader a glimpse into her creative process and talks about the process of designing some of the projects in the book.<br /><br />All of the photography in this book is masterfully done and allows the reader clearly see the details and textures of the jewelry.  The book closes with a gallery of jaw dropping jewelry that you can't help but be inspired and awed by.
B001UJIMN2|3.0|The music is what it is. For me, this album contains the definitive \\"early years\\" tunes: \\"Taste the Pain\\" \\"Johnny Kick a Hole in Sky\\" and \\"No Body Weird\\" like me. If you have come this far back I am assuming you already have rocked these jams (perhaps with a sock around your ____). If you have not heard these, you're in for the goods. Not quite as much machismo as songs like \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" or \\"Jungle\\" man but a clear sense of direction is laid down in this album for the band that will one day go on to create the astonishing Stadium Arcadium. \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\" (of the Crazy Town \\"Butterfly\\" fame) hints at future slow jams like Under the Bridge and Desecration Smile.<br /><br />Now on to the vinyl itself. This repressing comes with a fancy sticker bragging \\"audiophile grade\\" 180 gram vinyl and touts this as being a \\"faithfully restored\\" reissue. I can only assume \\"faithfully restored\\" to mean faithful to the original 1988/89 (recordings/release date) tracks. That is, it sounds like this album was mastered in the late 80's which is probably a good thing for these particular tunes. The material workmanship of the LP is incredibly disappointing. Edges were rough and flaking off when the vinyl came out of the sleeve. I noticed chunks of vinyl stuck in some of the grooves after the first playing. Luckily there was no damage but I take serious issue with \\"audiophile quality.\\" Not that I am an audiophile but if even I am complaining you know it is not that good.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|If you are expecting ridicule, vilification, or even justification, this would be the wrong movie to watch on J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />Eastwood delivers a dark brooding, and rather objective look at one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in America. While the story itself may not be overly compelling, it does offer explanations behind some of the motivations that made up the man, John Edgar Hoover. The cinematography was a crucial element in creating and maintaining throughout a sense of secrecy, brooding, alienation, as well as distance.  The chronology is disparate and effective:  at times we see Hoover dictating his memoirs to an array of journalists and then we are taken back to the time in question, all the while framed in this overcast mood that fits the film and its subject matter perfectly.  As a matter of fact, the manner in which this was filmed constitutes, to me, the biggest indication of Eastwood's opinion one way or the other - Hoover was a dark man with some even darker secrets.<br /><br />J.Edgar's homosexuality as well as his proclivity for cross-dressing are only suggested and are handled with the utmost sensitivity.  There is one scene which strongly implies his helplessness with his desires to cross-dress that was simply quite touching.  And the relationship between Hoover and Tolson was beautifully written.  No, I did not come away feeling empathy/sympathy for Hoover at all; neither were any of my perceptions surrounding him challenged in the least.  I did leave the film however with surely a more heightened sense of his humanity.<br /><br />This could NOT have been accomplished however, were it not for the positively riveting performance by Di Caprio.  This guy can just ACT, okay? The other supporting players were equally excellent, most notably, Judi Dench who played his overbearing mother, Naomi Watts as his faithful secretary, Helen Gandy, and Armie Hammer, as Hoover's lifelong companion, Clyde Tolson.  Some of the movie's most compelling scenes involved these three and all three gave powerhouse supporting performances to match Di Caprio.<br /><br />I highly recommend as yet another excellent outing from a very good director.ost compelling scenes involved these three and all three gave powerhouse supporting performances to match Di Caprio.<br /><br />I highly recommend as yet another excellent outing from a very good director.

B007HO392S|5.0|I am a 64 year old man, not a big country music fan. My wife likes American Idol so I watch it with her and first saw Carrie when she was competing. When I saw her do the title song a couple weeks ago I was impressed and downloaded this album. My initial impression was accurate. This is an edgy piece of work - not nice girl lovey dovey stuff. Very little filler. One Way Ticket, Nobody Ever Told You, Good Girl, Two Black Cadillacs, and the title track are excellent and most of the rest very compelling. One of the best new albums I've heard recently.
B00723NWJE|5.0|So far I considered NJ's output as nice but boring. The new record, however, is kind of cool - I like it a lot. Like it even more after having read all the 1 star reviews - great job Danger Mouse and NJ. Yesteryearers will come back and purchase the next \\"Greatest Hits CD plus DVD plus Blue Ray rip off\\" but cool people dig the new record - now back to listening to Rome, the fictional Soundtrack by Danger Mouse and Daniel Luppi feat. vocals by Jack White and Norah Jones. Bought the MP3 for $5. Well spent.

He gives you ACTIONABLE points throughout the book, eliminating the fluff that we use as excuses to procrastinate. There's no BS; just helpful, well researched, tested, and simple guidance.<br /><br />Also, an unexpected bit of advice from me: If you have a teenager, I'd recommend buying this book for them. It will change the way they see their opportunities in the future, which is extremely important in the economic environment they'll be launching into after they finish school.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|WOW!  I'm not a push-over for any movie...I usually find myself overly critical on many aspects (acting, cinematography, story, effects), but this movie had such a chemistry, all expertly spun by the director...I was blown away.  Not overly campy, not too serious & preachy...just good fun with good friends.  This is probably on my top 5 list with the likes of Forrest Gump, Heat, Bourne Trilogy, etc.  Got the series after seeing the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it also.  Hoping for more someday?  Please?

1609613937|5.0|The Starch Solution will explain in an easy-read manner why everything you think you know about food, nutrition and particularly dieting has not been accurate, and therefore didn't work.  Dr. McDougall's life has been spent helping people stay well or get well, not with meds and surgery, but by eating well - and plenty.  I couldn't lose weight no matter what I did.  Then I followed The Starch Solution.  In 10 days I lost 5 pounds, my cholesterol dropped 28 points, and I flushed my bp meds.  For the first time in my life I'm not hungry, my weight has stabilized at pre-college weight, and I feel terrific.<br /><br />I call myself a 'heat and eat cook' meaning I do it the easy way; no recipes needed.  Mash some potatoes (white or sweet), steam some veggies, make a salad, and have some seasonal fruit for dessert and I'm satisfied.  Boil some pasta with tomato sauce, add some veggies and a salad and another meal is ready.<br /><br />The Starch Solution is a departure from what we're accustomed to seeing on our plate, but how we feel and how we look will be worth whatever effort it takes to make the change. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.
0307454568|5.0|I started reading the second book in the trilogy as I was told each book could be read separately. I found it difficult to put it down. So I was very anxious to read the last one. But in order to appreciate The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's nest you did need to have read The Girl Who Played with Fire, the second book in the trilogy. I now wish I had disregarded the advice and had started reading the first book.<br /><br />Some of the criticism to the second book could apply to the third one but in a way those minor points of criticism did not matter too much as the story as it finished was gripping. It was very satisfying to see the loose ends at the end of the second book  picked up. Once you start reading Stieg Larsson you do not think about if anything he is writing about is feasible, you just accept it. With the current news coverage of issues such as computer hacking , the control of social networks by many governments, and other similar issues, what Larsson writes about no longer appears to be far-fetched. At the same time, the cleverness and courage of individuals and groups such as radical journalists that is often in our news now, appears to be awe-inspiring and indicating the strength of the human mind. With advances in technology and the speed of communication, Larssen's books point out the advantages and also the potential dangers of human beings coming to terms with these advances. Majority of us are trying to cope with the issues of survival, but for our own good and the future, we have to accept these changes.<br /><br />It is a shame that I did not start with the first book; while it is tempting to start reading it now, it will be an anti-climax as I know from the later books what the true picture was. So starting with the first book in the trilogy is a must - my advice to new readers.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book came highly recommended through the media and I was not disappointed. The dialogue from Ana was slightly repetitous (her inner goddess becomes annoying) and I had to remind myself that Christian was on 27. The fantasy of their relationship was enjoyable and I quickly moved onto the other two books. This is my first time at reading such a sexually descriptive book and it was very entertaining.
1451648537|4.0|Spending any time in Silicon Valley during the 90s and the early years of this century (2000-2011), even a casual follower of Apple and Steve Jobs knew more than enough about him and the company. The ups and downs of the company and Jobs' shenanigans there were very well documented by the SV media and the national press with local offices. You had a good feeling that you knew the guy...and didn't want much to do with him nor the company, unless you truly loved the MacIntosh.  Isaacson did a great job in providing background to the major announcements most SV people knew about Apple and Jobs. He was very comprehensive in reporting all the events, people, places and things involved in getting the product (s) off the ground. Isaacson also brought out all the key players standing with Jobs...the roles they played and what/how they contributed to the overall success of Apple's peaks and valleys.  Although well written, the book still is not an easy read if you want to pay attention to all the details about how a major Silicon Valley company is made...broken...then redeemed. This is especially so, if you wanted to know how such a company could have even succeeded much less thrived by a personality like Jobs' who seemed more prone to isolate than to create loyalty in his workers.  Isaacson tried to be as honest as he could in reporting all sides to Steve. He seems to have done exhaustive interviews with friends and foes. Despite trying really hard to gauge the Jobs' personality, we're still left at the end shaking our heads and wondering WHY and HOW someone, granted so much talent, skills and grace by the creator of things could be so clueless when it comes to human interaction. There seemed no point or limit to Jobs' meanness, other than for the sheer POWER and ARROGANCE of it. We're left to wonder WHO really could work with the man and HOW they worked with him with any level of success. He seemed to respect few... but how they SURVIVED with him is another matter. We never got any insights into their strategy for &#34;managing&#34; Jobs, other than from Anne Bowers who, near the end of the book, gave Steve a summation of who he was in his early days.  At the end of the book, Isaacson assesses that Jobs' was not particularly &#34;smart.&#34; Instead, he thought Jobs was &#34;genius.&#34; But you are left wondering, how truly &#34;genius&#34;  someone could be, if he really had no clue as to how to connect to others he considered &#34;lesser than&#34; himself in a real human way. This is no fault of Isaacson's...he did a good job in reporting that the personality, Jobs, didn't leave him much room to even understand him...himself. Even the writing of the book...and who would do it...was orchestrated by a dominant, willful and determined soul. May Steve Jobs rest in peace, knowing that his legacy of good and bad lives on.
0062082353|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. (It's what he wanted!)<br />He absolutely loved it and thought it was a great read. He said it was fairly detailed and hard to put down. I will begin reading it this weekend!
0345803485|2.0|The plot is very simple, reminiscent of the Harlequin romances I read when I was a little girl.  The characters, down to their names, are like the results of using an online \\"build your own soap opera character generator.\\"  As for the sex and BDSM scenes, it left nothing to the imagination, relying upon its so-called \\"shock\\" value. Yes, people actually do these things.  Get over it.  Basically this book appeals to women who won't admit they really do like pornography.

B0021L8V1Q|2.0|We loved Iron Man! We thought Iron Man 2 had a weak story line with so - so characters. Although the Black Widow is introduced as a character in this movie - there is nothing to tell you who she is or what her history is. The story did not set up the villin (M. Rouke). Although he plays a good 'bad guy' in other movies, you did not know his story other than a few second of something about father-vs-father. Very disappointing. We thought it was worth two stars for the Iron Man costume alone.

1451648537|5.0|As a new user in Amazon.com from Asia, I did not realize there is an international shipping charge, while Amazon does not have any prompt reminding me on the charge as well.<br /><br />When I was a bit disappointed about the service, I tried to contact the seller immediately to see if I could cancel the order.  Actually I don't have much expectation as I think it is not the seller problem, but me being careless or the bad of Amazon web design instead.<br /><br />However, surprisingly this seller is a very honest one that they do help me cancel the order and make the full refund.  Thank you.  If I have other chance buying book on Amazon definitely I will try forestmoonbooks again.<br /><br />Thank you!

B000009EAD|5.0|Today this record is a classic of heavy-power metal. Every song has its own strong points. Noone can denied the quality of this album from start to finish. Here begins the Something wicked trilogy, being this one the best of the three. For the fist time we can see Set Abominae, the equivalent of Maiden's Eddie in the cover.<br /><br />The music is really good, well done, John Schaffer is the master of riff and the other guys of the band sounds really compact, very tight, displaying heavy even thrashy tunes that will make bang your head. There are a couple of power ballads too that aren't mellow or weak, the feeling is there.<br /><br />Well, just buy it, go and try it your self. you can't go wrong with Something wicked. To me, the best Iced Earth album, even better than Dark Saga.
0525423281|5.0|I loved the companion book to this one, Anna and the French Kiss, and hoped Lola could live up as well.  It did! I found myself eagerly turning the pages through the night, unable to sleep until I finished it.  My husband kept asking if I was going to go to sleep at all.  My answer? As soon as I'm done.<br /><br />Once again, all of the characters were beautifully written, giving you a sense of \\"knowing\\" them. I also love that Stephanie is able to make you feel what ALL the characters are feeling, even though the story is told from one viewpoint.<br /><br />Lola was a fun, lovable character, with her own quirky style that was perfect for her. Cricket was amazingly hot, and frankly, the boy every girl wishes was next door.  Max was sexy personified, and helped make a nice triangle.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was good too, never making it seem as if there were dull/slow moments.  I found myself truly caught up in this tale!

I think all readers need to get at least half way through the 1st book before they decide to form an opinion.  Thus far the 2nd book is my favorite and disappointed that this last book will be the end.  I almost feel as if this book has lit a fire in my soul that has been out for quite some time after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids.  Open your mind and just indulge.....

0738711500|5.0|I bought this on a whim having a curiosity about the Tarot, and I am hooked.  Ellershaw is very detailed and thorough in her explanations of the Tarot as a whole and the specific cards. Some of her descriptions of cards though I found to be a bit vague or confusing, but this book gets everything going as far as self-readings go. The book is also designed to take you along a course in three parts, which is helpful in building your knowledge of the Tarot and going into your first reading with plenty of background.  She also emphasizes the respect and care for the Tarot.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is definitely worth having for beginner Tarot readers.  The deck included is also beautiful and the images clearly portray the meanings.  I also have a Rider-Waite deck and I prefer the Marchetti.  Good luck to all those embarking upon the Fool's journey
0345803485|4.0|First off, I'll say I enjoyed the book.  Didn't think I would, but it was a quick, thoughtless and somewhat enjoyable read.<br />But mostly, I wanted to submit a review thanking the person who Kindle-searched the word \\"murmur\\" count.  199 times!  I found myself giggling every time I came across it after the 30th page or so.  Does the author own a thesaurus???

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Given the subject matter of these books, I never thought I would like them because I'm not into violence; however, after my sister recommended them, I decided to give them a try. I COULD NOT PUT THEM DOWN! The characters are fascinating, and the plot riveting. It's a very unique and clever plot, with lots of twists and turns that kept my adrenaline flowing.<br /><br />I would not recommend these books to young children, as the premise is very disturbing and simply not appropriate for the pre-teen set (in my opinion). I would encourage parents to read these books first, then they can decide if/when their children should read them.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like many others,  I enjoyed the game until my crops,  buildings and animals started setting at 280+ hours. I filed an official complaint with Amazon on this game. Maybe it will be fixed if enough of us file an issue.

0385344228|4.0|This tense novel was a wonderful combination of Turow's Presumed Innocent and Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin.  When a prominent District Attorney discovered that his teenage son may have been involved in a local murder, the ramifications are nearly too great to contemplate.  Both career and family disintegrate as our DA protagonist, who tells the story in first person narrative, finds himself caught between his legal instinct, his parental instinct and ghosts from his own past.<br /><br />This is a very fast-paced novel that explores not only the legal ramifications of the premise (a son who has possibly committed murder), but all of the different emotional trajectories.  The author does quite a nice job of presenting even unsympathetic actions of the characters in a thought-provoking light.  While I'm not going to tell you whether the son \\"did it\\" or not, I will say that there is enough controversy in this novel to make it an excellent book club selection.  You may or may not see the twist at the end coming (some, I suspect, will even think the twist cheapens the story), but it does stick with you long after the last page is turned.<br /><br />If you enjoy gripping thrillers, I would highly recommend this novel.

If not Please let me know. The sample matches the originally titled book exactly. This review is from the sample.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I first read this story on Fanfiction.net when it was called \\"Master of the Universe\\" as a Twilight fan fiction. I enjoyed it while I was bored and passing some time but other then that this series should have stayed where it was. It's not terrible but I dont see how this story got so big.
6305882592|5.0|The theme of the movie is edgy and perhaps inappropriate for its extreme depiction of a deviant behavior. The story is about a wealthy and obsessive teenager named Harold who is self-destructive and preoccupied with the thoughts of suicide, self mutilation, fascination with attending burial ceremonies in the local cemetery, and the destruction of property. His wealthy and somewhat eccentric mother, tired of his compulsive behavior, helps to broaden his social skills by sending him to a therapist, arranging for a date through dating services and even buying him a nice car. At the end she even forces him to join the army. Ultimately it is his friendship with anarchic 80 year old woman by the name Maude that materializes into a strange but positive experience in his life. This is not exactly May next-December romance but a relationship in which he finds many common interests with her that turn into love and romance. On The day he proposes to her, to the dislikes of his mother, family and friends; he finds out that she is dying and in fact that is the last day of her life. It doesn't appear to be tragic because of so many inequalities and inadequacies in their lives, but the relationship is depicted in a non-sexual manner with sensibilities and finding common interests irrespective of their wide age difference.<br /><br />The movie is set on 1960s themes of anti-establishment with a Woodstock-sense of responsibility. Yet Harold exhibits strange a sense of responsibility when he finds Maude destroying and stealing property, he tells her; \\"you are upsetting people,\\" regarding his appointment with therapist, he says, \\"He can't miss the appt.\\" and expresses sympathy for Maude when she says she has no friends. The movie in many depicts the strange thoughts of many young people of today who succumb to drug and other self-destructive behavior. It is a study of a sociological and psychological condition that is harder to understand and appreciate.<br /><br />The highlight of the movie is the fine performance of Ruth Gordon as Maude and Vivian Pickles as Mrs. Chasen, the wealthy mother of Harold. The film is strongly supported by Cat Steven's fine music that provides the soundtrack.<br /><br />1.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Powerful social commentary - combines elements of the Olympics with America's insatiable desire for reality shows (i.e. Survivor, American Idol, etc.). Unspeakable heartache for a culture's momentary pleasure.  Mix in some beautiful archetype themes, i.e. substitutionary death, and some in-depth relatable characters, and you've got a very powerful series.
0545265355|5.0|The issues other people have with the trilogy, and the first movie for that matter, didn't really come up for me.  The font was fine and there weren't any pages that weren't supposed to be there.<br /><br />I actually wasn't going to read the books or see any of the movies because I thought it was like the Twilight storyline but my friends convinced me to see the movie at least.  I read the books afterward, which by the way is actually a decent plan.  I knew what the plot was during the movie even without reading the book and was happy with how closely the movie follows the book.<br /><br />The boxed set was back-ordered when I bought it so I figured it would take some time to get to me and it took longer than normal.  Instead of the regular 3-7 days that it normally takes to get things I order from Amazon, it was more like a month.  I thought that was pretty good considering the demand.  I know some people were upset that they didn't get their books within a couple days but like I said, they've tended to be back-ordered.  I prefer paperbacks but those are hard to find, I did buy one on Ebay though for around $30 in addition to this hardcover set.<br /><br />As for the plot and the books themselves, the violence isn't anything you can't see on the news or read in newspapers.  The movie didn't have a lot of blood and guts either.  I see more in a lot of video games.  I'm not sure about a 13 year old reading them but definitely anybody in high school should be fine.  People also seem to forget that the Hunger Games themselves aren't the actual point of the story.  People are focusing on the kids killing each other like that's what everybody should be taking from the books and that element is only the part that sets up everything else that goes on.  The concept of the Hunger Games isn't as ridiculous as some people are saying either.  The point of the Games is to punish the populace for rebelling, and I can think of no better punishment than to force them to watch their children kill each other.  Aside from the Capitol people, who you're supposed to think are clueless jerks, nobody enjoys watching it.  They do it because they have to.<br /><br />The books (and probably the movies too once they all get made) aren't meant to be stand-alones the way some other sets are so if it seems like the plot moves slowly it's because it's spread over all three books.  I don't know how much the story will make sense if you try to only read one or read them out of order without knowing the entire plot beforehand.  In terms of pages, the plot goes slower than some would like but the whole trilogy is such a quick read that I think I read the whole thing in about 24 hours spread over the course of several days.  Since it's meant for younger people someone like me who's been perpetually reading for over a decade can get through them in no time.<br /><br />Sorry for the essay, I just really think people should buy these books and having the hardcover boxed set cost the same as the paperbacks is a great deal.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is perhaps one of the best books of this century. While I was expecting more love story in this book, it couldn't have been better. The love is vague at the beginning but comes to a fabulous ending. Speaking of which, the ending is unlike most of those today. It comes to a sensible story-book ending. Because of multiple characters, I wouldn't suggest this to someone who isn't good with names. Hint from the wise: pay attention to the dates and places listed under the chapter name. With chapters that have different points of view, and even second person chapters, you will fall in love with not only the book, but the circus and characters as well. A definate must-read.

Frankly, if they ever remotely *dream* of coming after me for growing real food, the way it is meant to be grown, I'll slam them with such a return.  They deserve no better.  I DON'T want their ills in MY food.  If their garbage trespasses here, they're in for it.  I certainly don't want it here, and it is their responsibility for keeping it from crossing property lines.  Serious.<br /><br />Or are they so omnipotent that such distinctions don't matter?<br /><br />Piff.  Right now I'm just a backyard gardener, with too much shade to count (though I do what I can), but watching this film, I'd ANGRY and not going stand aside when truth counts more.<br /><br />This is a SUPERB film.

0439023483|4.0|Anything said may be an understatement for this novel. Thrilling? Hmm.. Yes. Exciting? Most likely. Heart wrenching? Definitely. The story follows the unfortunate turn of humanity wherein power is all anyone lives for. The weak are a measly little ants; the bottom of the food chain, crushed at any moment, both with force and pure naivity.<br /><br />The story pours out fire, flesh and fleeing for life, not to mention fighting to the death.. But substance is the key to the success of the novel, where down time calls and plucks on any strings one has in their heart. A truly emotional story that will leave you asking why, why children? Why this torture.<br /><br />The writing style is quite demure at times and it is clear that the story is written for a varying level of readers, and that is understandable if a writer wants their story to be appreciated by all, but it is also a shame as wreaks of being written with the intention of a movie; lacking complexity and challenging concepts for the reader to unravell in their minds. However, the concepts that are presented question ones place in humanity and the ever growing power of global companies and government.<br />All in all, a truly fantastic novel that I could not put down. Will Katniss Everdeen live? Don't cop out and spend a fortune on a movie ticket for a couple of hours of joy; Buy the book, feel the pain in the grainy pages, smell the fear in the pages and find out for yourself, over and over again.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This app has several tools, from paint brushes to clip art and several inbetween. What it lacks, however, and what prevents it from being GREAT instead of good is the omission of tool size control. Want finer details in your pencil or brush sketches? So do I, but apparently the creator(s) of Drawing Pad have primarily a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mentality, because with the exception of the paint brushes, which come in large or twice as large, all other tools offer only one size: thick lines. Where oh where are the REALLY useful sketching apps??
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved Catching Fire. The reason I rated it four stars was because the story lacked the strong and entertaining vibe for the fist few chapters, the vibe tha got us all hooked to The Hunger Games. I really enjoyed the introduction of new characters, especially Finnick and Johanna. They offered a differemt depth to the story that added perspective to Katniss's view of the games, including life after.<br />Essentialy, Mrs. Collins offered us a gutwrenching, nailbiting sequel that sure left me wanting more.
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|I hear a lot of negative remarks about the movie but I've never let them stop me from enjoying the fun of the film. Regardless of how much the film may stray away from the original comic book source material, Constantine is an interesting take on the concept of heaven versus hell. For a first-time director, I have to give some credit for what he was able to pull off and I think the special features give audiences a better understanding of him and his intent.<br /><br />As for as the blu-ray features, there's a hefty amount of filmmaking information that will keep movie fans busy for at least an hour, watching in-depth explanations of how the director approached the design of the film and it's special effects gags.

This is like watching a love blossom and work through struggles and  learn how to compromise. There may be a few lessons to be learned from behind the scenes... A lot of sex but it only adds to the complexity of the story line. Truly a great read!
B004EPYZV2|1.0|Loved the movie, saw it in IMAX when it came out.  Giving it one star due to deceptive and inaccurate listing by the studio and Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon and the studio failed to disclose this is an UltraViolet digital copy.  You cannot load this into iTunes and can view it only by streaming. This means if you want to watch while you are not on wi-fi, you will be chewing through your data plan.<br /><br />To access the digital copy, you will are required to open a Flixster AND UltraViolet accounts, link them together and allow they access to all activity and information when accessing either account.<br /><br />I am returning this movie and purchasing my digital copy from iTunes directly.

The two main characters brought out the best in each other and Ana proves the healing powers of love. I recommend that you buy all three books because one is not enough.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books in a week.  I loved them, just finished #3 last night.  I fell in love with Ana and Christian.  I was captivated, mesmerized by all three books.  The sex was so hot!!  I found it VERY believable, I could totally relate to Ana and her naivety. I thought was an amazing love story.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|Although derivative (drawing from elements of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars), the first season of Legend of the Seeker is quite fun and has some really nice episodes in it.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars for production value, but only 3 overall.  It is to the Lord of the Rings movies as Star Trek the Next Generation was to the original Star Wars trilogy.  In other words, this is the level of production value that fantasy fans have been waiting to see in a fantasy TV series.  It really has an epic scale and they don't skimp on special effects.<br /><br />I also really like the characters.  Richard Cypher (the Seeker) is the sort of all-around good guy we all want as a friend.  The Confessor, Kahlan, and the Wizard Zeddicus, are the same.  You want to follow their story.<br /><br />The villains are appropriately villainous.  They slaughter whole villages in retribution against a few residents.  They torture their enemies.<br /><br />I have a few geeky quibbles with it.  One is that the wizard Zedd never lifts a finger against the Mord Sith, bad girls in leather who absorb magic.  If he's such a wise wizard, can't he think outside the box?  If he's a Wizard of the First Order (which they tell us he is), couldn't he, say, make the ground swallow the Mord Sith up or make the grass grab their feet (neither of which would be direct attacks)?<br /><br />Whenever the Mord Sith threaten him, he just gives in.  But, we know that he can turn invisible.  Couldn't he at least do that and run away?  Any wizard who is stopped dead by magic-absorbing enemies isn't terribly wise, in my opinion.  But, I quibble.  It's still quite a fun show. :)<br /><br />I watched every episode, despite some of my nit-picks.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Everyone I knew was all \\"OMFG YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!  IT'S THE BEST THING EVA!!!!\\". So I eventually got around to reading it.  I have to say, I did not love it.  I barely even liked it.  I regret spending money on it and wish I could return it.

0307352145|5.0|I listened to the Audible version of this book and found it both helpful and enlightening.  As an introvert who plays an extrovert, and the mother of both, I found this book helpful on so many levels.  Introverts will appreciate this for the self affirming and survival skills that it offers and extroverts would learn to so much about the side of the world that they judge so harshley.<br /><br />I most appreciated the chapter on parenting and the career selection advice for introverts.

0345803485|5.0|I know the book has gotten a lot of bad reviews along with lots of great reviews.  I am with the great reviews.  Yes it is a little roughly written but if you look past all of the BDSM if you are not really into that type of stuff and really look a the story you will find a book that you cannot put down.  I laughed, I cried and I did not want it to end.  It is not just about sex it is about Christian really \\"finding his self\\" with the help of Ana.  I just finished book 3 this morning and I already want to read it again!!
B005LAIHKY|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  Johnny Depp does a terrific job playing Barnabas and Eva Green does such an amazing job playing Angelique that you can't help but to love her evil character.  The funny parts are hilarious and the menacing parts are just so wicked.  The final showdown at the end of the movie is one of the best I've ever seen.
B004H4XAXO|4.0|I found it different and enjoyed how the story was told and new type of enermies and hero's but the book ended just when I was really envolved.  I have been looking everywhere on Amazon to see if there is a follow up - Book Two ?? if not it has left you up in the air - not happy
0345803485|4.0|This is going to be a quick one since a lot of reviews have already been posted on this book and it seems like people tend to either fall into the \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" camp where this book is concerned. Surprisingly, I fell into the \\"love it\\" camp.<br /><br />What is most surprising about me liking this book are two things. The first is that before I even picked it up, I read a ton of reviews about it, especially the negative ones, and I went into it looking to hate it. The second being that upon starting the book, I could not help but correlate, in my mind, the character of Christian Grey to that of Patrick Bateman a la \\"American Psycho.\\" When we see Christian buying rope and zip ties, the psycho alarms went off. When we heard about Christian's very clean, muted, sterile-feeling office and apartment, more psycho flags were waved. For me, Christian started at a negative 100 and worked his way up to about 50% on the \\"OMG WANT!\\" scale.<br /><br />Christian, just like our protagonist Anasasia, was written really well - and I'm not talking about mannerisms, language, or avoiding cliches; there were plenty of those. For me, it was more of being able to understand why Ana was so confused about Christian, and why she struggled with what she wanted from him and their relationship. Unfortunately, it seems like the author is a little out-of-touch as to how a 21-year-old American college student would think, speak, and act - and that was a little annoying to read as someone who was, herself, once a 21-year old, English Lit majoring, college student. Like seriously, who uses \\"surname\\" in this day and age (in the U.S.)?<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that the characters absolutely had their flaws - ones that had me eye-rolling (insert Christian spank), but those flaws did not make me any less emphatic to their situation.<br /><br />Lastly, the book was undeniably a page-turner. I was held captive under its spell and I wanted to know more! Unlike other books I've read recently, I found myself wanted to read this whenever I had a free moment. The sexy scenes were sexy, but they didn't make or break the book for me. It was that longing to know what happens next that ultimately kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />Overall, I had to give this four stars, in spite of all the problems it has because it did was a good book is supposed to do - it transported me directly into the story and made me a voracious reader. I'm absolutely going to be reading the rest of the series.read recently, I found myself wanted to read this whenever I had a free moment.

B007Z5WMCW|1.0|links to you tube...poorly! Avoid at all costs. Clicked on the weather and it told me that material was un-appropriate for my devise yet the \\"movie\\" was a poor quality 3-d animated thing with two folk with no skin fondled each other. Finally, the You Tube log in popped up and I could go back the app's' original screen but couldn't so I deleted the miserable thing!
0062124293|5.0|This book is absolutely outstanding! I anticipate it climbing the ladder to literary fame very shortly. \\"How to be a Woman\\" is feminism for the modern day. Caitlin Moran is hysterical; a picture of me would have revealed a crazy lady sitting in virtual pitch blackness at 2am with random guffaws intermixed with snacks and beverages. I have been recommending this novel to every woman I have opened my mouth to speak to. One of the things I like the most about the book is the fact that Moran really focuses and what \\"we\\" as women do to ourselves (essentially, how we are active participants in our own oppression); she talks about how we wax, work-out, and trend ourselves to within an inch of our lives. Why do we spend astronomical amounts of money on purses, make-up, thongs, shoes...what's behind all that? There, of course, is also a secondary focus of talking about men and society and the expectations that each of those expect from women. Moran has written and exceedingly clever book; she is exposing uncomfortable truths about our culture, she is speaking the \\"unspeakable,\\" but because she has managed to couch it in humor we find ourselves easily laughing with her. Hers is the type of book that will encourage people to wake, talk, and act. Superb!
0525423656|3.0|I really liked Matched, and in fact, I counted it among my favorite books from last year. It took me quite a long time to get around to reading Crossed, and in the meantime I had been getting negative vibes about it from reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was better than I expected it to be, although neither was it particularly outstanding.<br /><br />First of all, there's a big change in the setting. The previous book took place in the slick, futuristic Society, while Crossed is more of a survival story in the rugged desert. The landscape is harsh and unforgiving, yet Cassia and Ky both find a certain kind of beauty in it. I feel this sums the book up as a whole. Dystopian fiction is dark by nature, with the characters often finding themselves in terrible situations. Crossed is appropriately serious as the characters face the concept of death and inner demons, yet they always choose to hope instead of turning to despair.<br /><br />Although I was on the edge of my seat for Cassia and Ky to find each other, the book as a whole did seem somehow bland. The characters travel around quite a bit and undergo some introspection, but a curious lack of tension and foreboding meant the plot suffers as a result. There's also a nagging sense of familiarity: if Matched felt like The Giver, Crossed feels like the Obernewtyn series by Isobelle Carmody.<br /><br />What does distinguish the book from similar fiction is the author's style. Condie incorporates poetry into the plot, and her prose is very poetic and beautiful itself. Nevertheless, I was not such a fan of the way Condie switched between perspectives. It was important to hear Ky's side of the story, but I often had difficulty figuring out who was narrating halfway through a chapter. In addition, the supporting cast of characters is small, but I did not find them very engaging and had difficulty caring that much about them at all.<br /><br />In short: Though it has an optimistic tone and her lovely prose,Crossed focuses on inner journeys to the extent that the book lacks a gripping plot. I'm hoping this reflects a middle book slump, as I do plan to read Reached to finish the trilogy.<br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Something better: For a more interesting frontier-style journey, check out Exile, the sequel to Aurelia by Anne Osterlund. As mentioned above, I would also recommend the Obernewtyn series. It's very long (I haven't yet finished it - it's been ongoing since the 1980s) and could use some editing down, but still a good  post-apocalyptic read.<br /><br />Cover & Title: \\"Crossed\\" could have several connotations based on the contents of the novel. I love the set of the three covers as a whole. The cover for Matched is stunning and attracted me to the book in the first place. The significance of green, blue, and red is also very important. I have no clue why they chose that particular pose for the model on the cover of Crossed, though. It looks like something out of an extremely unnatural yoga session...<br /><br />Where I got the book: Local library
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|was at level 30. game froze and when I was finally able to turn my kindle off was set back to level 28, money gone and everything at 250+ hours to collect. loved the game up to that point.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|My 4 year old daughter enjoyed the movie.  She wanted to see it and I did not feel like going to the store to rent it.  I was pleased to see that it was available on Amazon.  She can stream movies from Amazon via her own ROKU, which is a very convenient arrangement for all.  As a bonus, I received a discount from Amazon on the rental of this movie when I connected my ROKU account to my Amazon account. So far, Amazon has had rentals available for movies that are not available via Netflix streaming.  I would like to have more opportunities for Amazon movie rental discounts.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Thanks for the heads up on the the UV. I was just about to order this one. I loved the movie when I went to see it in the theater, but I think I'll pass on this one. Hopefully I can find it in just plain old DVD or Blue Ray. Thanks again!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What more could I say about Fifty, I could not put the book down (my kindle). I had not ordered the other Two books in the trilogy in case I did not enjoy the first. Just purchased the book Two and Three. To be continued....

B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun. Good free game. There are some ads but you can skip; they do not take away from playing the game.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|I started reading this book not knowing what to expect. It was a bit odd at first and I had a bit of a struggle getting into it. However, the psychological thought of it intrigued me to know what was going on.  Very good read and it leads you turning the pages because you just want to find out what is wrong,and how did this happen. All the puzzle pieces start forming together and before you know it you are finished.  I enjoyed this book. Gave it 4 stars.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's clear why this is a best seller. Well-written, fast-paced, and engaging, it moves the reader into an alternate world immediately and keeps us eagerly awaiting the next event. That said, it's also clear that this is a \\"young adult\\" book. The relationships and reflections of the characters are true to their youth and the adult characters are seen through those young eyes--somewhat distant, stereotypes of adults wielding power. I'm an old lady and I was glad to have read Book 1, but I won't go on to Book 2.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I downloaded this because my purchased copy of the NASB didn't have a good way to quickly go from passage to passage to follow our Sunday teaching. This does have a good feature for that. It does have a couple drawbacks. E-sword for my PC has keywords search,  which was great. This also doesn't have a downloadable version of the NASB. I had to settle for a different translation for Sunday mornings.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Okay, yes the book has a lot of sex and language and although it speaks of bondage, it a story about a young man who has come from a bad childhood but inside him is a caring and generous person and it takes Ana to find him deep inside this outer shell of a person.  If you can read past the dom/sub lifestyle he is trying to push her into and look into the characters, its a great story.  Book 2 is equally as good with less dom/sub lifestyle and more romance
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much and would recommend the book to anyone. It was exciting and quick reading. The movie was also very good.

0307951529|5.0|So many books are written these days about how to start a business. Most of them focus on plan, plan, plan, analyze, execute.  It's a wonder how anyone gets the courage to start something, when all the gurus put up this wall of tasks you've got to complete before you get around to actually launching something. This is the first book I've read that gets rid of the analysis paralysis being peddled in huge tomes that put you to sleep, and gets to the nitty gritty of what's important: action.<br /><br />By no means does Chris imply that planning isn't necessary. Rather, he focuses on the importance of coming up with a simple plan to get going, focusing on execution, and revising along the way.  This book isn't aimed at someone wanting to become the next mult-million dollar darling of wall street, it's written for those of us who desire to do good in the world by changing lives(including our own), and earning a livelihood while we're at it.<br /><br />Other reviewers have made light of the fact that the title of the book is misleading, as it costs more than $100 for a laptop, internet, mobile phone, and other expenses related to starting a business.  I think this misses the point that most of the entrepreneurs in the book launched with what they already had(who doesn't own a laptop?), and merged their personal skills with a gap in the market that was under-served.<br /><br />For the vast majority of would-be entrepreneurs, the major obstacle is not money, resources, or a sure-fire idea.  It's courage to take action.  Most people under-appraise their skills and abilities, and this is a major obstacle in getting started. This book serves as in inspiring read to give you the right mindset for starting a business(or anything in life for that matter). It then merges that with real-life examples of people who've successfully taken the leap, and provides you tools that you can use to get started.<br /><br />It uses simple language that every person can understand, rather than all the business jargon and theories that only an MBA would be able to decipher. I completely support the premise behind this.  The audience for this book wants to start a viable business based on their passion. They're not looking for yet another obstacle(and advanced degree) to have to overcome in order to launch a business. Besides, these days it's clear that education is so overrated compared to real-world experience.<br /><br />If you're afraid to start something because you're not sure if it will work, get this book to give you confidence that even the simplest ideas can actually become a viable business for you. Of course you might fail, but why focus on that? Businesses fail all the time. When you look back, your biggest failure could be in never having started.  This book will help you get started.  But you already knew that when you read the title. :)
B007WZ7ILK|5.0|Shade's of all eras, from Surfer Girl, through Summer Days, through Pet Sounds (that vocal break down), Sunflower, Holland (middle eight) and beyond. Sounds great. Can't wait to hear the warmth via the vinyl release which I'm sure will highlight the mellower aspects. And it really grows, becoming more interesting under repeated scrutiny. Foskett adds smooth highs - lacking the gravitas of Carl's one-off timbre, but this is Beach Boys 2012, and it doesn't do the legacy a disservice at all. Infact, it might have you believing that this IS why God made the radio. Looking forward to the L.P. Nice to hear Brian singing the lead off single too, proving that this is a band. Can't wait to hear Mr Love either. Good, good, good track :-)

B004SYP5WC|5.0|This does not have tons of bells and whistles but it gets the job done. I got tired of having bills drafted out of my account and having them bounce for one stupid reason or another (my fault, of course) so I started manually paying my bills again like in the \\"olden\\" days. I keep accidentally paying them late. I then made a spreadsheet in Excel with bills and their billing and due dates and would open it with Quicken to \\"pay bills\\". Only problem was it still didn't remind me when a bill was due and I'm so over email that sometimes by the time I check it a bill is past due! So I got this little app. You can set reminders for however many days before the bill is due, whether they repeat or not, how often they repeat, bill types, payables or receivables and a host of other things that I can't remember off hand. Then when the reminder pops up, you can mark it as paid or \\"snooze\\" it to keep reminding you daily, until you have actually paid it or delete it altogether. I LOVE THIS APP!
0345803493|2.0|I read these because it's all I've been hearing about and was curious.  Book 1 was intriguing, much different than anything I've read before, but even before I'd finished it I was noticing that it seemed to be lacking professional editing.  Once you notice that there is no going back, and every repetition of \\"Holy Crap\\" drove me further and further away from liking this series.  If you truly believe the man<br />you love is dead, would your first reaction to seeing him alive be \\"Holy F...!\\" - I would hope not.  The writing was so juvenile it was painful.  I doubt the author anticipated that it would be so widely read, but honestly who is her editor? Let's say she doesn't have one - does she have any honest friends that could have sat her down and explained that the books would be so much better without<br />her overuse of certain phrases?<br />I didn't hate these books and they were entertaining but by the end of Book 2 I'd had enough of the writer's style.  It's a unique topic, somewhat disturbing, but I feel like I've lost a few IQ points.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|After listening to just the first song and a half, I had to stop what I was doing and say \\"wow.\\"  WOW!  I have been a stalwart Keane fan from the beginning, but this album is setting up to be something extraordinarily special.  I hate to say that, because I hate sending expectations into orbit, but damn, this is good.  It's so....optimistic?  From Keane?!  Well, that might be putting it a bit too cheerily.  But something has definitely put a smile on their faces, and I must say, it is infectious.  Even the more melancholy tunes and lyrics are delivered with punchy beats backgrounded with soaring keyboards and twinkling piano highlights.  But it's the songs with upbeat lyrics (such as \\"Silenced by the Night,\\" \\"Watch How You Go\\" and \\"On the Road\\") that are making this jaded old college DJ nostalgic for a chance to get behind the mic and share the magic with y'all.<br /><br />This is definitely a pleasant surprise after the various directions they experimented with on the EP \\"Night Train\\" (which I very much enjoyed, but for different reasons).  The sound on \\"Strangeland\\" is not at all strange -- in fact, it's clean, most readily comparable to their first (and still masterpiece) album \\"Hopes and Fears.\\"  Refreshingly earnest after the rather bleak \\"Perfect Symmetry.\\"  This is the kind of music Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys would write if he could stop himself from being so wry, if not smug.<br /><br />Those who look to Keane for a bittersweet pill to chase the misery of daily drudgery will either be disappointed, nonplussed, or -- if you're like me -- cranking it up to 11 and jumping around the room.  Seriously, people, Keane seems to have figured out that life is too short for melancholy self-pity.  Amen, my brothers.<br /><br />SING IT LOUD, SING IT PROUD!!
B004SIP6ZE|4.0|Somehow or other I missed this film until now.  I happened to watch the TV series, with Mark Dacascos, left a glowing review, and liked it so much I had to see the original.  Wow- a great soundtrack (with the Cure, a favorite band), my favorite car ('73 T-Bird), and Brandon Lee dynamic and angst-ridden as the Crow.  And best of all, more shots in the movie than in the TV series of the crow (the bird) itself, flying, guiding, etc.- more in keeping with its mystical nature.<br /><br />My purpose here is to contrast the movie and the series.  I'm not sure if I would have liked the film QUITE as much had I not seen the TV show first (hard to know- you can't un-ring a bell).  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of glorifying evil, especially, with gratuitous sex and violence (cutting out people's eyeballs and eating them, lascivious sex scenes with one's sister, etc).  Nor am I a fan of films that create entire WORLDS peopled by beings that glory in others' pain- sadists who laugh with glee while cutting out others' hearts, etc.  Fortunately, in the real world such people are relatively few and far between.<br /><br />But the movie was suspenseful and jam-packed, well-crafted.  It left me wanting more.  And that \\"more\\" was MORE than satisfied by the TV series.  I thought it superior in several ways to the film, but it's like comparing apples and oranges- in other ways the film was superior.  The TV series was a somewhat kinder and gentler version of the film.  Less of a roller-coaster ride, yes, but more thoughtful, detailed, far-reaching.  For example, as in the scene where the Crow wreaks such a profound change on Darla, we simply see her fix her daughter breakfast and that's it.  In the series, we see her wrestle with change, witness the complete metamorphosis of her character.  The TV show took the time to flesh out Draven, Shelley, Albrecht, Darla, everyone.  We see in detail Eric and Shelley's relationship, and his resurrection.  And it deviates in some intriguing ways from the film, e.g., in its treatment of Fun Boy, which spans several episodes.  There are plenty of challenging ideas hinted at in the movie, with no time to explore.<br /><br />The main difference between a movie and a TV show is pacing (duh).  The show was 22 hours long (one season).  It took different elements of the film and developed entire episodes around them, for example, the capture of the bird itself, Eric becoming mortal, Sarah being taken hostage, all in different episodes.  There was time to explore many more issues and possibilities.  I'm no prude, but I don't think the show suffered in the least by omitting obscenities and gore (although every episode features an exciting fight scene or two).<br /><br />The world created in the TV show is not quite as dark- more mysterious- sometimes menacing, sometimes beautiful.  And bad people aren't everywhere, just here and there- in boardrooms, in laboratories, in organized crime, even in internal affairs, but never fear, wherever they are, the Crow will find them.<br /><br />Dacascos's violence is toned down (i.e., fewer deaths result, at least until the end) and tempered with justice.  I thought he held his own in every way, charisma-wise, with Lee, and his martial arts skills are simply breathtaking, a thing of beauty.  And, he maintained this charisma, dynamism and quasi-magical persona throughout the entire series- never a false or incongruous note.  The only person I felt whom suffered by comparison to his character in the movie was the actor who played Albrecht, perhaps too reserved, in contrast to Ernie Hudson- a TOUGH act to follow.<br /><br />If the movie left you wanting more, and it's not just more violence and knee-jerk, quick vengeance you're craving, I encourage you to buy the TV series (it's a bargain).  It definitely rounded out and deepened my Crow experience.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OCY7OO The Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete Series]]from the film, e.g., in its treatment of Fun Boy, which spans several episodes.

The only person I felt whom suffered by comparison to his character in the movie was the actor who played Albrecht, perhaps too reserved, in contrast to Ernie Hudson- a TOUGH act to follow.<br /><br />If the movie left you wanting more, and it's not just more violence and knee-jerk, quick vengeance you're craving, I encourage you to buy the TV series (it's a bargain).  It definitely rounded out and deepened my Crow experience.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OCY7OO The Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete Series]]
B00005JKNC|5.0|Being the Romantic Idealist that I am...I couldn't help but love this film...for it's sweet romance...and memories of small town America in the early 1950's...  Jim Carey is at his best in a more serious role, rather than the goofy Ace Ventura or Grinch.  But it brings one to a sentimental place of loving God and country, and what so many Americans have given their lives to defend.  But I did not agree with one major issue.  They made the FBI and the Congress investigation of the infiltation of communism look like villains.  When actually, America was in a cold war with Russia.  Stalin and Mao had killed over 100 million innocent people, just because they were opposed to the Marxist totalitarian governments.  And the KGB had infiltrated into America and was trying to influence all sources of media, including Hollywood.  They were right to be concerned.  But, the closeness of the people in small town America was a very strong statement about the greatness of our freedoms and democracy...This is a film I wanted in my favorite film collection.

1401219268|5.0|I've read comic books, off and on, since the late 1960's. While I've enjoyed all genres, my favorite ones have been the superhero types. And within those, my favorites were of the Batman and Spiderman variety ... the comics where the protagonist were mere humans (Batman, Daredevil, and Iron Man, for example) or marginally superpowered heros (Spiderman), all with human flaws and problems, and struggling to overcome them. And so it is with the characters in this graphic novel, &#34;Watchmen&#34;.<br /><br />Since my desire to read comics comes and goes, I completely missed the entire &#34;Watchmen&#34; phenomena when it first came out, and I didn't watch the 2009 movie of the same name. However, I recently came across some discussion about the &#34;Watchmen&#34; and decided to give the complete graphic novel a read. Now having read it, all I can say is &#34;Wow!&#34;<br /><br />While in my opinion, it isn't completely without flaws (for example, I can't quite get how Rorschach, such an unbending paragon of absolute right and wrong, can continually break into other peoples houses, filter through their possessions, and assault people for information, even if he is mentally a few bricks shy of a load). However, any flaws that I perceive are very minor when compared to the rich, complex story and wonderful illustrations. Comic books, as a literary medium, are typically considered &#34;lightweights&#34;, the same way that the sports section is thought of in most newspapers. However, every so often a work like this comes along that shows how deep and powerful of a story can be told using this format.<br /><br />The graphic novel was named as one of Time Magazine's Top 100 novels. While I won't go quite that far in my own evaluation (it is, after all, still a comic book adventure about a bunch of superheroes), it's amazingly good, and sits at the top of its genre alongside Frank Miller's &#34;A Dark Knight Returns&#34;. Five stars.

B004SGWYVA|2.0|High School of the Dead is a REALLY campy zombie anime. It has a fair amount of impressive drawing, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Though you may say, \\"what do you expect from a fan-service anime based on zombies\\"? The thing is, they obviously put thought into *parts* of the anime, and then ignored that thought for other parts, and their timing REALLY has issues.<br /><br />For example with consistancy: There is one scene where they're trying to figure out how the zombies work for finding their prey, and find they're completely sound-based, and will chase after even a dropped shoe or light metal tap. Later on, they're having a party, and zombies don't do much, and later, a dog is barking in the middle of a crowd of zombies and they completely ignore it, walking past it. To gather outside of a house that is (at that time) relatively quiet. Oh, and they regularly go after one gunshot when elsewhere there's lots of gunshots.<br /><br />For example with plot: The more intelligent member of the group at one points begins questioning how the zombies function... is a virus, is it living dead, is it some kind of military weapon.... and..... nothing ever comes of that question. Ever.<br /><br />For example with timing: *spoiler alert* There is a REALLY dramatic scene where a small child's father is brutally murdered right in front of her in an act of desperation. It is probably one of the saddest and emotional parts of the entire show... and it's almost immediately cut off with fan-service with silly boinging noises.<br /><br />The thing is, the anime keeps showing it *could* be deep. At multlpe points, it starts to broach deeper topics about the zombie apocalypse... and then immediately ruins it or just conveniently forgets it a short bit later. It wold have been better if it had developed those points, or at least never hinted it could consider being deep in the first place.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a really fun app and it works well on the kindle fire. I like the high quality of color and crisp screen quality. It really is one of my favorite free apps. It is great for all ages.
B005HSL626|3.0|I really love fruit ninja, but when I go to the dojo  to try a new sword, my game freezes and I have to uninstall the app. I want something different from the same old sword and background, so if the error gets fixed, five stars!

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Best book I have read! Awesome!  Nicholas Sparks is an amazing Author! Keeps you guessing until the very end!<br />I could read it over and  over!!!!
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|This movie is excellently paced, entertaining, and well written. It does NOT follow the protocol for Hollywood action films, so it receives bad reviews. There's a reason Hollywood keeps turning out the same exact movie, people are going to them and if they ever get something different, they complain.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun for all my three year old and I play together, new family game keeps you on your toes or hooves lol
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|This is still the greatest slasher movie of all time. Now that it is on blu ray it looks better than ever. Well worth the upgrade!

0345803485|5.0|Soooo freaking good!!! I can't even explain. Buy it. It's worth if.  I wasn't sure I would like it but I was completely sold on it. Can't wait to read the next 2!!!!
0345803485|1.0|After all the hype over this book, I see the author admits she doesn't think she's a great writer.<br />Believe me she is right.  Though this is most definitely true, she's not a bad storyteller.  But it is badly written,  I found my self speed reading the book, the sex scenes in Fifty shades of grey left me<br />pretty much cold. I reckon the book is erotica-lite. I have recommended to friends if they intend to read the book borrow it instead of paying out the money for this book.  I won't be reading the follow ups.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series and was happy with how it ended.  It is fun to read and I got invested in the character's.

Their sound fit the song to make it different-stll Blue Grass-still what I want to listen to & feel good as they always make my day. Once I start a CD I don't want to exchange it for a recent release or any of previous CDs-all are my favorites. The newest I just purchased \\"Alison Krauss & the Union-Live\\" is, again, one I will wear out. LAR
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps you coming back, can be difficult to get enough points though. The rest of this is just filler, moat.
1400069289|5.0|This book is broken down into three phases, section one is all you need to learn. The other two sections are oriented toward the whys of business. Reading section one allows you to understand your own \\"personal\\" habits, like smoking or eating. I highly recommend it.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|[[ASIN:B007UXSPK2 Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol]]  Tom is his own worst enemy when he talks to the press, but give the man a break, he has been giving us good entertainment since 1982 \\"Risky Business\\", \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"MI-1\\" and so on.  This version of the beloved TV series Mission Impossible does the original show proud.  I have seen every TV episode of the original show and Greg Morris, (RIP) went to my high school in Cleveland, OH.  No greater tribute can be given to the show than to have Mr. Cruise whip up some fantastic action for fans to enjoy.  I won't go into the story and actors and all that, because they were not going for the Academy Award.  Action, action, and more action, and that's what we got.  Great action flick, the \\"T\\" man is in top shape for a 50-year old and this is very enjoyable to watch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. 101 in 1 is amazing I never thought that someone could actually do that it combines soooooo many cool games into one,  WAY easier to find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0743238257|5.0|I highly recommend everyone read this book.  There is something for everyone in it.  Scott Peck tells it like it is.  No political correctness, nothing offensive.  Just good ole traditional values and common sense advice and stories for self growth.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Fantastic game. Kinda of addictive too! great espsecially for kids. To keep them quiet !! Good for if u r bored at work even.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I per-ordered this item and it was delivered just as advertised, no fuss or anything.  The album itself is great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some kind of suck but others are fun and slightly challenging.it would be better if it had less ads.Give it ashotpeople you might actual like it.
031617615X|4.0|Very good book, but not as good as the others in my opinion.  But, in what series do the sequels actually get better than the original?  Very happy with it!  I always like a happy ending :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book wraps up everything. It is ice cream with the cherry on top...Yes Christian is complicated and troubled man but in the end the love he has for Ana is so breath taking.  You get the whole story here as to why he is the way he is.  You just feel for him...I love how he loves Ana so much.  Great read..I was sad when it was over, I laughed, I cried, I ohhed, I ahhed, I riped nails off while I read these 3 books.  It is a great read if you are a hopeless romantic.
B007URCTOG|3.0|I watched the trailers for this movie, and instantly I was in love. Sadly, that feeling didn't last very long. Now I'm not saying this movie was terrible, but it also didn't rise to meet my expectations. On the plus side \\"The vow\\" had likable characters, a solid plot, and AMAZING chemistry between Tatum and McAdam's. Aside from those positive points I was still disappointed.<br /><br />The first half of the movie pulled me. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed the romance between them. A big plus were the flashbacks, I felt that it showed the TRUE love between the couple.<br /><br />The second half is where the disappointment started. For a long period of time the movie was basically at a stand-still, you didn't know what was going to happen to the couple. Would they stay together, split up, would she ever remember? Then, after all the back and forward between them, the movie just comes to an end. It happens unexpectedly, and basically leaves a lot of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Basically this movie had the makings of an everlasting love story, but fell short somewhere during the second half. Although, it wasn't one of my favorites, everyone should be the judge for themselves.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Of course there will be tons of bad reviews about how the quality of writing isn't the best, however, the story line is reels you in!  I can't put the book down!  It's my guilty pleasure!
0439023491|5.0|The book is very well written.  I was hooked right away and couldn't put it down!  As a side note, I really like the cover design when you take off the dust cover.  Pretty cool.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So much happens in book 2! Great great read...If you read book 1 you will not be disappointed the magic continues. Oh Christian!!!! Hot sexy broken man...You get some more insight.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|I love Denzel Washington and I watched this movie twice over the past 24 hours.<br />It's tough to get the first time around.  Even twice is not enough.  It reminded<br />me of the movie \\"Memento\\" with Guy Pierce, but this one is better.  Paula Patton<br />was fine in it, as were some of the other supporting cast.  Watch it or have you<br />watched it and forgotten, deja vu???
B007NZDES0|5.0|If you can't comprehend all the love people are showing Sade in these reviews--you have never attended ANY of her concerts.  I had the pleasure of attending two of her concerts last year--one in Charlotte, NC at the TWC Arena, and the other at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, NC. Sade was mezmerizing, hypnotizing, entrancing, spellbinding...and on, and on...<br /><br />I have been a fan since the '80's--I bought all her albums and cd's but could kick myself for never having attended her concerts before last year.  I guess I was too busy going to Prince concerts and missed out on a group that truly stood the test of time.<br /><br />Sade has gotten better with age, and in the entertainment business, that's almost impossible to do--but this group has done it, and they've done it with class.  Their sound is unmistakenly classic Sade.  I cannot wait to get their new DVD so I can relive last year's concerts again...ahhhhh...I'm a happy camper!
B000VUCIZO|4.0|This is a great read for techies but would probably not appeal to the general public. I could not put the book down once  I started it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had decided I wanted to read this series when I saw an article in the NY Times...\\"If you loved Twilight you will love 50 Shades of Grey.\\" Hooked from the start. The book is hot, raunchy, kinky, sexy and filled with deep passionet love...deep deep love.  This is my opinion...If you like a good love story with twists and turns this trilogy is it.  I thought it was well written and draws you in quickly. You will know if it is for you or not within the first 3 chapters.<br /><br />I read all 3 books in a week.  Could not put down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and a great way to exercise the brain.  I love the comics, artifacts, and the game in general.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Thinking that a little light hearted reading this summer between The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt and Oliver Twist would make pages turn faster, I downloaded Fifty Shades of Grey (trilogy) onto my Kindle.  This is the most sophomoric writing to ever hit best seller lists.  After a quarter of a way through the book I was dreading Christian saying, \\"Ana, stop biting your lip and eat your meal.\\"<br /><br />Wow!<br /><br />Now, how about a little Ann Rice?
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I use mine all the time and it works great!<br /><br />One thing though was after using it a couple of times, the piece that holds the top of the camera came off when I tried to take the camera off one day but this was sort of a benefit because I was able to super glue it back on but I added  about 2cm of space to make it easier to get my phone out.  To this day, the super glue has held up and so has the rest of the unit.<br /><br />The added bonus was the tripod.  I have one made by Targus and the Targus unit is a lot more adjustable and is a bit heavier than the one this unit came with but it still does the job nicely.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|I read this series last summer and it was one of those books you could not put down. If you saw the movie but have not read the book...read the book.  The books have so much more than the movie.  This is a thriller book. Lots of action.  You have to get through the first few chapters and get over all the names and locations (based in Sweden) to really get to the good stuff.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|As most people know, both the European and US versions of this movie are terrific: ***** for the movie.<br /><br />But the movies comes on a DVD-R, not on a production DVD. The disc is labeled as though it was sloppily written with a marking pen. I note that Amazon now has a bold-faced statement on the product's page saying that the artwork on the disc is what was supplied by the film's maker. That doesn't explain the DVD-R. I haven't checked to see if it is really a DVD-R or an actual DVD whose artwork includes the designation of DVD-R to go along with the hand-scribbled looking label. The other thing I note is that Amazon's statement about the artwork being supplied by the film's maker implies that someone (Amazon?) used the artwork and made the DVD-R recording.<br /><br />The bottom line is that regardless, the disc plays fine.
B007DJUO8O|4.0|I was not looking forward to this album.  Not one bit.  Over the past year I've started despising these two artists.  Lately Steven Wilson, to me, has come across as a bit of a douche.  He never stops talking about his take on art and he seems to arrogantly embrace his own musical talent.  Every time he opens his mouth he speaks like every thought he makes is gold and, because you are so fortunate, he will give you the honor of listening to it.<br /><br />Mikael is not as bad, but he's getting there.  Heritage was a profound disappointment.  It had a few good songs sure, but it threw out everything that made Opeth so great in order to make room for Mikael to artistically stretch himself.  Needless to say, Heritage left a really bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />So I bought Storm Corrosion.  I had low expectations.  Really low expectations.  The fact that Steven and Mikael kept referring to it as \\"twisted beautiful\\" didn't help either.  I was waiting for a horrible disaster.<br /><br />Luckily, the album is actually pretty decent.  Better than decent.  It combines the best the two artists have to offer and creates a pretty cool sounding album.  It combines Steven's knack for soundscapes and vocal ambience with Mikael's exceptional acoustic picking and mellow guitar solos.  The best example of this is the song \\"Storm Corrosion\\" (my personal favorite on the album).  It features beautiful acoustic picking by Mikael over Steven's quiet vocal performance.  Eventually the soundscapes flow in along with a few mellow guitar solos by Mikael.<br /><br />Even though Storm Corrosion is a fantastic album, there are a few glaring flaws.  The most important of which is the fact that Mikael sings hardly at all on the album.  Instead, Steven sings in his soft falsetto throughout the whole thing.  This bugged me.  Mikael has a truly exceptional voice that sounds like angels making sweet love to one another.  Steven has a nice voice, don't get me wrong, but it's hardly anywhere near Mikael's.  Another problem that I had with the album is it's unbridled pretentiousness.  It's constantly smacking you in the face with it's own greatness.<br /><br />While Storm Corrosion is a very good album, it has trouble escaping the pretentiousness of its creators.
B001EU79F4|5.0|I bought this tape a LONG time ago, and fell in love with Tom Waits after hearing it.  I missed this so much I finally got it on my MP3 and have lots of his other stuff.  These are great bar songs, sad, moving and full of life. Love it!  PS I don't drink anymore but still love these songs! They are timeless.
B004EPZ0AC|3.0|Lots of music. The music also comes for different genres, so fun for everyone. Even though it's a \\"kid movie\\" any adult could join in and have a laugh or two and enjoy the music
0062071017|5.0|\\"The Strategist\\" is an outstanding book that simplifies strategy to its essence and provides a simple yet powerful framework.  Highly recommended.  Detailed thoughts below:    -I first came across Professor Cynthia Montgomery's work in 2005 when I read \\"Competing on Resources\\", an influential Harvard Business Review article that married internally focused resource-based view of a firm with Michael Porter's Five-Forces externally focused framework.    -More recently, I heard more about her work from a friend who recently graduated from Harvard's Enterpreneur, Owner, President (EOP) program.    -The best thing about the book is that it distills strategy into a framework that is simple to understand but very rigorous nevertheless.  According to the book, a good strategy entails the following:    1. DRIVEN FROM THE VERY TOP, and cannot be left to strategic planning departments or consultants. It is the fundamental job of the CEO to develop and implement strategy.  Note the focus on implementation: Without effective implementation, strategy is nothing.  As she says: \\"Many people believe that a strategist's primary job is thinking.  It isn't.  The number-one job is putting together an agenda and putting in place the organization to carry it out.\\"    2. A COMPELLING PURPOSE, which tells you where a company will play, how it will play, and what it will accomplish.  Without this, employees, customers, and investors alike remain confused about a company's mission, and work off of assumptions.  As she asks, \\"If your company disappeared today, would the world be different tomorrow?\\"  This is illustrated with a variety of examples from companies such as Four Seasons, Nike, and Google.  What I like about this is that she is not dogmatic about the format or the length of the purpose; rather, she wants to make sure that the elements above are covered.  (A good related article is \\"Can You Say What Your Strategy Is\\", a Harvard Business Review piece co-authored by David Collis, who was Professor Montgomery's collaborator on the aforementioned \\"Competing on Resources\\" article.  [...])    3. A SYSTEM OF VALUE CREATION, comprised of mutually reinforcing parts - a system of resources and activities that work together and reinforce each other (\\"coordinated, internally consistent, and interlocking\\").  She presents the \\"Strategy Wheel\\" framework to develop this value creation system.  What I liked about this was that the framework is not dogmatic and can be adapted to one's industry or firm quite easily. (A good related reading is \\"Good Strategy, Bad Strategy\\" by Richard Rumelt, which also focuses on a series of coordinated actions that must be implemented for an effective strategy.  http://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239)    -The book contains compelling case studies of Masco, a manufacturer of bathroom fixtures, that tried to get into furniture manufacturing (go figure) and Gucci's near-death experience and subsequent resurrection.  These case studies are then tied back to the LEADER DRIVEN-COMPELLING PURPOSE-VALUE CREATION SYSTEM framework.    -As a bonus: at less than 200 pages, this book is an easy read.    I would highly recommend it.
B006UISWB0|5.0|this is an excelent album and the blue vinyl is awesome every rush fan should have one just as every collector should

B004P9GOAC|5.0|This is a great Lego set for anyone who is a fan of engineering, cars or Legos.  The car is a blast to build (took me about 6 hours) and makes a great display piece once finished.  It is filled with very cool little engineering details that mimic the mechanics of the real thing such as ...<br />- V8 containing a crank shaft and pistons that slide realistically when the rear tires turn<br />- working rear differential<br />- working suspension on all 4 wheels<br />- working steering, albeit controlled by a gear at the top rear rather than the steering wheel<br />- working manual transmission allowing a single motor to independently move the motorized doors, hood and spoiler.<br />- U-joints<br />- worm drives<br /><br />The battery pack requires six AA batteries.<br /><br />The building instructions are a bit unclear in a few places, but nothing severe.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|This story I felt to my core. The plot line is light hearted, but so many deep things happen in this film. Anne Hathaway did an amazing job. I own it and watch this over and over again.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|At 40 years old I've known these stories virtually my entire life, ever since my Dad took me to Ep.4 in '77.  And yes, I've heard every single opinion out there...but the truth is, the bigger something becomes, the more debated it gets.  And nothing's ever been bigger than Star Wars.  Personally, I think the naysayers often take more time to rip these films apart than those of us who love them take to defend them.  Because, honestly, what's there to defend?  It's the greatest sci-fi adventure/saga/movie serial of all time.  Period.  And for those who reply that the new ones don't live up to the originals...let me say this:  nostalgia's great and all, but I was around when the old ones came out; I read the comics, had the posters, ate the C-3PO cereal, and debated with my friends endlessly over every little nugget of those classic films...and the simple fact is: we WOULD HAVE LOVED THE PREQUELS back then. We would have LOVED THE CLONE WARS animated series back then.  Instead, we got the 'Holiday Special'.  In the late 70's and early 80's we had Star Wars comics with a green talking rabbit hanging out with Han Solo, and yeah, we loved him too.  We loved anything that was Star Wars.  And Ep.1-3 are far beyond anything we ever discussed or imagined.  I never wanted to see anyone else's vision of Star Wars but George Lucas', and after all these decades, to finally get to see the entire Star Wars saga in AMAZING HI DEF with surround sound makes this entire box set the culmination of every single childhood fantasy my friends and I ever had.  This series is incredible.  Do I prefer some episodes to others?  Honestly, no, not really; it depends on what kind of movie I'm in the mood for.  They're all tonally quite different, but cut from the same cloth.  In fact, maybe that's exactly why I love this more than all other movies.  Upon buying this, I showed the entire series 1-6 to my girlfriend for the first time, and her two favorites were Ep.3 & Ep.6...and ya know what, I think the ten year old version of me would have agreed.  Today, I'd pick Ep.3 & Ep.5...but I might feel differently tomorrow.  I guess that's the point.  A great series now with an amazing blu ray edition.  I'm happy.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I was a big fan of batman, but not a big fan of this movie. The effects were ok, the storyline was trash
B00004VXF2|1.0|One of the worst albums every made by a popular artist. Period. \\"Metal Machine Music\\" is annoying feedback without any structure. When my dog howls it sounds more like music than this.<br /><br />I can think of only one or two albums worse than this--the albums that John Lennon and Yoko Ono made (you know their \\"artistic\\", avant garde ones). This is more annoying and tunless than the Youtube video with the dog that barks but sounds like it is screaming--and that was at least amusing.<br /><br />If I could give this release 0 stars I would.<br /><br />Lou Reed should be embarrassed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game! its really a fun game to play!! I love all of these movies! I cant wait till the new comes out!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This box set is the single best designed and implimented blu ray box set ever made. While the Star Wars box set was designed with a similar \\"book\\" type of approach, this one has better artwork.  Also, each film has two versions, plus virtually every single extra content material ever released.  If, like me, you only watch ALIEN and ALIENS and not the other two, it's still ABSOLUTELY WORTH it for the extremely detailed making of ALIEN3, which tells step by step how to screw up a franchise and it's sequels.  Extremely fascinating.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I have nothing bad to say about this movie. The action and blood shed in this movie makes it in my top action flicks. Bending bullets? How can that be anything but cool to see?
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This was hyped as one of the best thrash metal albums of all time and I couldn't ignore it any longer, so I picked up this album after years of sleeping on it. Now I understand what everyone is raving about. This is true heavy metal and it's amazingly well composed and every musician plays their parts extremely well, sometimes so well that it's almost mind blowing. The song \\"Dawn Patrol\\" is the only song that isn't really a metal song but it's very cool. Dave Mustaine kind of speaks like a crazy poet while the bass and the drums are incredibly intense and affective.<br /><br />Dave Mustaine's voice isn't for everyone but I must say that it fits in every song on this album, whether he's singing, screaming, growling, or talking like a crazy narrator. Everything comes together and this truly is a legendary album. I don't compare this to Metallica because I think Megadeth are in a league of their own and Dave Mustaine's style has a certain sophistication and different vibe that can't really be compared to other bands.<br /><br />The bonus track \\"My Creature\\" sounds like an out-take from the cutting room floor but it isn't terrible or anything (it's about the bride of frankenstein).<br />I personally don't care about the early demos of songs on the original album but they're definitely good.<br /><br />If you like Megadeth and don't have this, I'm pretty surprised.<br />If you love metal and don't have this, you're definitely missing out.<br />Even fans of rock in general will be stunned by how good this is.<br /><br />Buy.
B005938CS0|5.0|Iron Maiden's debut album, easily the roughest and unpolished sound in Maiden's arsenal. This album features the punky vocals of Paul Di'Anno, the shredding guitar work of Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton, the driving bass lines of Steve Harris, and the slam of the drumming powerhouse, Clive Burr! This album is in the top 5 best list of Maiden's work which also includes the brutal follow-up, Killers! One of the most underrated albums of all time, and also the most under-produced album they ever made. Paul's vocals are constantly overlooked by \\"TRUE MAIDEN FANS\\", Iron Maiden did all of the hard ground-work with Di'Anno before they were discovered, so he deserves more credit than he gets. If you are looking for an Iron Maiden album to start with, this should be your first choice! It's always important to know where a band started! HAPPY LISTENING!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am glad I did not listen to all the other reviews. It was not ad bad as they said.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Team Jacob all the way. I haven't read any of the books yet, but if they're anything like this movie, I have to  go out and get it! Great movie! Tons of action and nice bodies
1439127700|5.0|Extremely well written, revealing and relevant. A history lesson on many levels and fabulously entertaining in the process.  We might all benefit from the lessons and insights provided.
B006O5XYWG|2.0|I like science fiction and the Planet of the Apes series. This movie I thought had potential, but the logical flow of the movie had a lot of logical holes. I mean, how did the ape know the virus had gone airborne later in the movie? How did he find his way back to the house?
0439023521|5.0|On the surface the book is rather disturbing, the idea of a game which demands that kids kill each other for survival.  However, if you look beyond the horror of the plot, the book was excellent and the characters for the most part alive.  I totally enjoyed it and read the book continuously until I finished it.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Great film about banding together. Gerard Butler did his thing in this movie. If you like action, blood and guts, you'll like this
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a pretty cool game. Its slow to earn money but still fun to play everyday. It would be nice if things were cheaper.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun little Mario-style game, the controls are good and the game isn't that difficult to play.  I recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it's been fun so far. just waiting to see how the neighbor thing works out. the graphics are really nice.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This story about Channing Tatum and being a foster kid was fresh. The Dance moves are pretty good as well. If you love music and love to dance, Check it out
B003G4W49C|2.0|This is a great story for people who like little boys. I was creeped out by the premise and was very uncomfortable with the relationship between the trainers and the boys, the hero in particular. &#34;Ender&#34; suggests enuendo, and not in a socially acceptable context.
B007FOV0QW|1.0|This company is the worst company I could have ordered from. It says it was shipped over a month ago and I am yet to receive my item. So I had to go to the store and purchase this cd myself. The album is a great album, but I have nothing kind to say about this company.
B001NLKT60|5.0|this is the second book of a trilogy and it is the most exciting read i have experienced in years. i read every day so that is saying alot.  i usually only read in the evening, but once i started these books, i could not put them down until i finished them. then, i went through a withdrawl period which i have never experienced before from a book. i just can't express how great they were.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I loved this movie. The storyline being from a real couple made this even more enjoyable. I would say it's a must see or must buy
B002RI9M2U|2.0|I just want to clarify that I didn't give this book two stars because it was a bad book, it just wasn't for me. Suicide doesn't sit well with me.    I should have thought about the fact that this book is about suicide more before I bought it. I was really intrigued at the beginning of this book, wanting to learn Hannah's story, it definitely hooks you in from the very first page. I only realized about half way through why I wasn't getting into the book as much as I thought I should be I personally believe that suicide is the most selfish thing that any one person can do, I'm not saying that it isn't a serious matter and that we shouldn't try and stop it, it's just to me when someone does something like this, they are thinking only of themselves. Of taking away their own pain because they don't want to fight anymore, not caring enough about how what they do will affect the ones that love them.    Hannah's character annoyed me quite a bit throughout the book, I wasn't really getting why she wanted to commit suicide other than just because she couldn't be bothered to put up with any of it anymore and to kind of get revenge on the people that had hurt her. I couldn't really see what Clay liked about her either, but I guess he didn't know her that well. Other than that, this was a great awareness sort of book and I would highly recommend it, you may like it more than me. It is a very education story about ehat effects our actions can have on others, especially when we don't realize it. In the case of this story, it is both the effects that Hannah's \\"friend's\\" had on her life, but also what effect her actions had on the people who cared about her like Clay. I really liked that about this book.    If you have read this book, you should check out this song about it by Alice Invictus [...]  All of her other songs are great too
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well the game was fun but they start ofwith more difficult. games and they really do not have vary clear game instructions but other than that it is pretty fun
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a good way to make and retain notes on anything. I use it to keep my own creative ideas together, and also share ideas with writers abroad. I can even update my notes (usually on the laptop) via my tablet.
B00051E906|5.0|Received early before stated time, works great for the money.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing a dector.
B007IYWY3C|3.0|The worst performance for Florence I have seen - all the punch was gone, I have all her stuff and if someone wanted to end her career - this is it. Every time the song was building to a crescendo, it was not there. Big disappointment, fire the director. That's my opinion.  Store was fast and accurate and would buy from again.
B004SEUJW8|4.0|I knew that the codes for digital copies expire, with a general rule of thumb of one year from the date the disc is released.  Amazon lists this product's release date as May 3, 2011, so that was just beyond that window, but figured I'd give it a shot.  I already owned the DVD and just wanted to complete my Blu-ray collection, and besides, at the time of my order the Blu-ray only version and this bundle were almost the same price.<br /><br />So in using the installer for the digital copy, I selected the iTunes version and was greeted with the message, \\"This application requires iTunes 7.6 or higher\\".  7.6?  Whoa.  That version was released in late 2008.  I tried redeeming the code directing through iTunes with the DVD inserted as the device, but that resulted in an odd message, \\"This code is for an offer not yet available. It cannot be used yet.\\"<br /><br />So one last shot and contacted Fox Connect customer support, but after a few rounds of emails and only getting canned responses back, I gave up.<br /><br />I gave this product 4/5 stars because it is still a great bundled value.  Although it can't compare to today's films such as Avengers, it still holds a valued spot in my collection as one of the early pioneers in the revival of the super hero movie genre.<br /><br />Update: Thanks C. Holzschuh!  I called FOX digital copy @ (866) 520-6606 and they were able to issue me a new code that worked.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I read through some reviews and came away wondering how so many people can think in so many different ways. I loved Mockingjay and consequently was as far from disappointed in any of the events that unfolded as I could possibly be. This book is about war, about greed for power and about loyalty inspired wrongly or rightly by bravery and a certain almost jaded innocence of the part of the main character. It is about growing up and understanding what is best for yourself even if it seems lame by other people's standards. It is about true love growing from experiences rather than looks and lust, and lastly it is about courage to go forward despite the nightmares. I won't discuss the plot except to say it made me cry and it was believable, in battles the good die more often than the bad and sometimes we are confused by the identity of the enemy. This is a good book and a good finish to the trilogy, and like the other two books very well written. I hope young people continue to read this because it is a book to make us question.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|no problems on my kindle fire. I found the levels to be a refreshing change from the other angry birds game &amp; my kids love the wacky flight paths of the birds!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I felt like I went to a great movie and had to leave 45 minutes before it was over. I never got to see the ending of the movie. George Martin spends way to much time on character thoughts and not enough time on the story.

B007SGM084|5.0|50 Shades is NOT porn. It is about the evolution of a sick mind into a healed one. The sex is only the vehicle used to show this change in tangible terms..<br />The Trilogy must be read to see the whole story concept. I found book two (50 Shades Darker) to be the most powerful.<br />\\"Freed\\" gives us the needed closure and the desired happy-ever-after feeling.<br />Are the books a realistic portrayal of BD/SM? Not really.<br />Do they take the reader to the edge of the 'forbidden zone'? Most definitely!<br />Just as the Twilight series teases the reader with unnatural liaisons between Vampires and humans..The 50 Shades Trilogy hints of a darker side of human sexuality.<br />Taboo topics never discussed in public are now argued over at lunch. This is a good thing. Adults should be able to think and act without constant guilt.<br /><br />The mutual naivete of both Ana and Christian makes the reader feel angst for both characters. Ana is clueless about physical sex and overly romantic in her idea of relationships. Christian behaves for the most part, like a possessive teen with his first girlfriend. (Which Ana is in truth). What causes the most buzz it the fact that the reader does get 'turned on' by the sex scenes and it scares them...just as much as reading a good horror story. This reaction was unexpected and feel naughty. A perfect combination.<br /><br />I can give this Trilogy a 5-Star rating because it is both groundbreaking and well written.

1554685133|5.0|If you saw the movie version, you will be surprised at the differences.  Looks like they cleaned up the script for the movie version to make it more palatable to the audience.  Read the book and see for yourself.
B004ZJZQ5G|2.0|I was excited to find one of my husband's favorite movies on DVD AND Blu-ray at such a low price. AND I could get a digital copy to boot. Little did I know that you have to wait for delivery of the hard copies to get a \\"special code\\" to download the digital copy from a 3rd party website that I'm not familiar with. I don't download from unfamiliar websites and have been hesitate. Also, you have to download the movie to your PC, Ipad or Android/Smartphone. I rarely watch movies on these items, takes up too much memory. I watch my downloads from my Roku, which I thought, wrongly, would be where I would download this movie. I was very disappointed with this deception. No where is the buyer made aware of all this. I advice you to just buy the DVD/Blu Ray from where ever and if you want the download, go to your usually familiar site. This is so unlike Amazon. Not happy with this purchase.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am an avid reader of all things fiction but have always been a romantic at heart. Due to how much I read it is very very rare that even with a good book I can't put it down. When I first started reading I didn't have much hope for the book, I thought the fighting was dumb and didn't love the characters. I stuck with it and am so glad I did. I quickly became completely wrapped up in the story. My heart was racing and I was on an emotional roller coaster throughout. I literally couldn't put it down and finished it in a day feeling like I wanted more. It's a beautiful raw emotional story and is officially my new favorite book that I am already looking forward to reading again and again. I know in the description it says it's young adult but on the author's website he classifies it as contemporary romance 17+. I absolutely love it! Must read!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's kinda like mario and for all you mario lovers you'll have fun. am I right. that's all I wanted to really say
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is fun and exciting . not too difficult to play.  easy to move the main character. I would recommend this game to others.
B0080CL0HM|1.0|This is a poorly acted period piece focusing on a very shallow gigolo and his romantic adventures. It is well staged but the lead actor is constantly smirking at inappropriate times. Not recommended.
B004SQS9FA|1.0|This album makes Linkin' Park sound like they have talent. Like U2 of recent, it shows that stellar bands stop trying and only look for the paycheck in the mail. I believe I could have pulled this off with the right electronic keyboard and too much time on my hands. I will not be surprised if this is it. But the world does need another sellout
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|A rather routine script but great action and good acting make this movie worthwhile. Break out the popcorn sit back and enjoy the ride!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first two books let the reader get to know who Katniss, Gale, and Peeta are. Katniss fights to get Peeta back, put the capitol in place with everyone else, she falls back in love with Peeta, and trys to figure out what her place is after being injuried after going to war. Peeta was hijacked by President Snow and programed to kill Katniss at any cost, trys to figures out what is real and what is not real, but in the end he falls for Katniss. Gale became one of the most important soldiers for the rebels with his strength, abilies to be strong for everyone, and he lets Katniss know she can have Peeta without worring about him. The capitol does not fall the way Katniss wants them to but it does fall in the hands of the rebels. In the end there are no more hunger games and everyone has more peace in their lives.

Katniss and Peeta give power back to the rebels during their tour but they are suppose to be maddly love getting ready for their wedding day and pergnant. In the first book the reader sees Katniss as a young women who is protecting her family. She does not understand why Peeta became upset when she tells her she was playing along with the plan about being in love with him. In this book it becomes known she was not playing at all but rather trying to protect her from Snow.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|this game restarts a lot and its basically a game of eye spy. it does have a lot of levels though which is nice.
0439023483|3.0|My anut and sister gave me a copy of this book but with the movie playing I figured I would watch that instead of read the book. I would say this book is a great read for anyone who wants to read a book that is filled with adventure and is a page turner.

0871404133|3.0|Having read a number of books by Wilson, I continued to learn a lot from this one, such as his new critical views on inclusive-fitness theory and kin selection (chapter 18). Especially noteworthy are his discussions of eurosociality, phenotypic plasticity, gene-culture coevolution, group selection, and more. Impressive is his statement, made despite the advancements in knowledge discussed in the book, on \\"our miserable lack of self-understanding as a species\\" (p. 287).<br /> However, leaving aside minor matters (such as off-the-cuff judgments against human space exploration, pp. 295-6), the book suffers from some serious flaws. The first one involves religion, which he regards as irreconcilable with science. But the real issue is whether science can prove or disprove the existence of a transcendental entity, not one of providing biological, psychological and evolutionary explanations of religious phenomena. As science has no way to take up the fundamental question of why there is \\"something\\" rather than \\"nothing,\\" all attempts to prove or disprove \\"scientifically\\" the existence of a \\"God\\" are ill-advised. It would have been better if the author had left this issue to philosophic discourse, however inconclusive, rather than join those who claim for science what is beyond it.<br /> The author also expects the validity of values to be supported or falsified by scientific findings. Thus, he criticizes Roman-Catholic views on artificial contraception in terms of their utility for family cohesion (pp. 252-3). However, while acceptance or rejection of values can in principle be explained scientifically, this has nothing to do with the moral validation of values, which is a matter for human judgment and essential for moral responsibility of human beings.<br /> When the book moves into success and failure of tribes, it loses its groundings. The statement \\"an iron rule exists in genetic social evolution. It is that selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, while groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals\\" (p. 243) sounds great, but does not stand the test of history. Thus, to take one example of many, it is wrong to regard Great Britain during the industrial revolution as distinguished by domestic empathy, while it became the dominant global superpower. Rise and decline of societies depends on many factors, but domestic altruism is not a major one.<br /> Finally, the author is much too sanguine about humanity and its future, He underrates radical evil, also within \\"tribes,\\" and overrates the potentials of \\"honor,\\" up to regarding it as the \\"final reserve of altruism that may yet save our race\\" (p. 251). Even worse, he ignores most of the dangers of self-termination of the human species stemming from being genetically and culturally unprepared to use for the better the increasing capabilities to shape the future provided by science and technology. This is all the more a pity as it would be important to benefit from the views of an outstanding thinking such as Wilson on what is the most critical issue facing the human species.<br />Professor Yehezkel Dror<br />The Hebrew University of Jerusalemof altruists beat groups of selfish individuals\\" (p. 243) sounds great, but does not stand the test of history.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|A fun, easy read, good for a rainy weekend when there's nothing better to do, but basically seems to be a little over hyped. It's another unconventional teenage love triangle with a female heroine, only set in a politically dissident background. Will go see the movie but this was not a life changed or mind blower for me by any stretch
0345803485|1.0|This is 2012, do we really need a book that encourages women to turn their backs on their core beliefs and moral values just to keep a man that isn't good for them because they know that in the end he will change because their love will save him! (Oh puhleeze!) Do we really need another damaged, rich, bad boy with dark secrets and darker sexual preferences? It's not the sex scenes that bothered me about this book, quite frankly those got old and annoying, what bothered me was the fact that all the characters are so two dimensional and boring. This book was the most tedious read of my life and quite frankly I rolled my eyes quite a lot too!

Lol just because you &quot;don't get it&quot; doesn't mean its a stupid game. I LOVE A CHALLENGE AND THIS GAME WAS FUN!!! Thankyou.
0307951529|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm a big Chris Guillebeau fan. Chris was the catalyst that launched me down the path to living the fully creative life of my dreams, so understand that I'm biased.<br /><br />That said, my bias is heavily informed by the fact that everything I've ever bought from Chris (and I've bought a lot) has been excellent. He doesn't do shabby stuff.<br /><br />That includes this book. Will it tell you every single thing you need to know in order to run a successful small business? No. Nobody could give you all that in under 300 pages.<br /><br />But will it give you a good overview of what's possible, and lots of inspiring, real-life examples of people running profitable businesses of all kinds? Yes, indeed! And even though I paid several times more than the price of this book to buy Chris's Empire Building Kit (which I also recommend), I still learned some new and truly useful things from The $100 Startup.<br /><br />If you're considering starting your own business, you could do a lot worse than to learn from Chris. The $100 Startup should really be on your required reading list.

0143121006|3.0|Paul French, a historian and an expert on China, takes us back to Peking in 1937. The Japanese are surrounding the city. Superstitions are running high. The Chinese believe in things like the \\"dreaded fox spirits\\".<br /><br />Paula Werner was just a school girl, a bit headstrong and free thinking, living with her father in Peking unless she was away at boarding school. Her father was a scholar and a retired British Consul. She had gone out to spend time with friends but never returns home.<br /><br />Then a body was found murdered, mutilated, organs removed, it even appeared the killer tried to cut her arm completely off and her face is almost unrecognizable.  The body is later identified as Paula Werner.<br /><br />Because of her father's British connection the investigation became quite a circus. Detective Chief Inspector Richard Dennis is brought in from Tientsin to assist the Chinese detectives but both governments really tie their hands to where, who and how they can investigate. With the suspect list growing and few actual clues, will the crime be solved before the Japanese invade and Peking as they know it is gone forever.<br /><br />Dollycas's Thoughts<br /><br />This is a very well researched story. It is a time in history that is pretty unknown in general history of the world taught in school in the U.S.  French presents the information methodically but I almost felt overloaded by all of it. The lengthy descriptions of buildings, streets and alleys.  The history of the time set forth in paragraph and after paragraph of dates and events and their effect on the nation. While all very interesting I felt the story of Pamela Werner got a bit lost at times. The roadblocks met by the detectives were immense and removed the expected drama of searching out the killer. Her father's continued dedication to getting  justice for his daughter was unwavering. His need to employ private detectives to find the truth, but never enough evidence to arrest or convict was heartbreaking.<br /><br />I know the author had to follow the facts and this is a true telling. It took a great effort for me to finish this book.  History enthusiasts will appreciate all the detail but everyday readers of true crime and mystery will find themselves like me skimming over the pages to get to a solution that never really comes because of the restrictions/corruption by both the Chinese and British governments.  French probably did identify the real killer but because of the obstacles in place at the time of the crime and the lack of crucial information the murder is still unresolved.  The outcome is not the authors fault as he cannot rewrite history.breaking.<br /><br />I know the author had to follow the facts and this is a true telling.

B000F9RB8A|5.0|Stephen Chow is a true performer and entertainer, out of all the actors ive seen, from old black and white films and all the way to today, only a few people are truly special. And Stephen Chow is one of those few joining a list of geniuses of cinema history.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a showcase of the sheer potential this man has. I loved the characters, and over the top story. A great use of imagination here. Only limited by its budget, which is nowhere near that of whats produced in hollywood, but give Chow a license to create a priceless epic, and he will inspire the world.<br /><br />This film though is mainly advertised as a comedy....but its oh so much more than that. Chow is clearly influenced by the great showman ship and scope of the great musicals and love storys of classic hollywood, along with classic chinese theater. Its a brilliant film in terms of its vision and plays out very well.<br /><br />The audience should be encouraged to use some imagination and keep an open heart while watching this, because its truly a fine piece of work from Stephen Chow, if not his best yet.<br /><br />I loved his earlier work like \\"King Of Comedy\\", but those were super low budget. But now it seems Chow has payed his dues in Asian cinema and is now getting higher budget allowance to really try to realize his dream on film.<br /><br />I would say that if you love film, and all that moving pictures offer, then i highly recommend this fantastic film thats filled with laughs, love, some epic moments even, and some unique style of camera work and presentation.<br />Stephen Chow's world is like a dream come true. Action packed, hilarious, lovable , inspiring and even powerful.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite films.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|This is one heck of a comeback album for Dr John. Produced by Black Key Dan Auerbach, it combines the Keys' garage esthetic with John's Gumbo New Orleans funk. That may serve as both recommendation and warning; if you dig on the Keys' wall of noise sounds, you'll probably like this more than older Dr John Fans might. The production is dirty and swampy, with minor key horns and wailing back-up singers piling on some serious blues.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Good Doctor uses the opportunity to rail against politics, to throw down a little old time religion, and to bump and grind like it's after closing time and the streets are empty except for you and some old friends with a piano. \\"Locked Down\\" is no excessive cheap nostalgia, it's a modern record with everyday concerns. Like the latest Tom Waits album, \\"Bad As Me,\\" \\"Locked Down\\" lets the man Mac Rebennack, and the persona, Dr John, come together and use the character's strengths for superior purposes. As the Dr prowls through \\"Ice Age\\" or storms across Auerbach's guitars in the title track, he sounds like a man unleashed.<br /><br />That retro-groove is astonishing, only letting down on the syrupy \\"God's Sure God.\\" However, there hasn't been a record this greasy from Dr John for a couple of decades, and there are no covers/standards that seem to have been his stock-in-trade for too long. \\"Locked Down\\" is the return of The Night Tripper, and as such, makes this the best Dr John album in near 20 years.

031618201X|4.0|There are a lot of Graphic Novel interpretations of Urban Fantasy stories out on the market these days(Jim Butcher, Kim Harrison, Patricia Briggs, etc.), but this is an entirely different animal. This is in manga form, a much more favorable way to tell a complete novel-length story. Next to a movie adaptation, this is the next best way to experience Ms. Carriger's story, SOULLESS, in a visual format. YEN PRESS has done a wonderful job! I'm looking forward to the next installment in the series.

B0034KZE9U|3.0|I work at Taco Bell, on my feet on concrete for 6-8 hours. Bought the Bistro as an alternative to cheapo lace-up non-slips (that stink godawful if you try to get your money's worth out of them). I also have chronic pain issues and have been going to a chiropractor for 2 years. I've previously worn expensive orthotic inserts to help with pronation and back problems... so going to these I wasn't expecting much. That being said:<br /><br />Pros: Relatively cheap, anti-bacterial, you can spray em down or soak em when they get dirty (nice smooth surface that's easy to wash), they are comfy on the feet(I was skeptical of the 'massaging nubs' on the inside of the shoe - but they're a nice touch), the non-slip grip soles work well (I walk through grease, water, and food spills at work and they measure up to any other non-slip shoe), and I feel like I can make them last a long time (I'm cheap, so I like to wear things into the ground until they break).<br /><br />Cons: I wear a half size 9.5M and have a C-D width, so I rounded up as per their suggestion... the shoes fit, but they're just on the verge of being too big (lots of space, especially in width) you might want to stay away from these if you wear half sizes. Also, the Crocs clogs are Mickey Mouse Clown Shoes - I don't mind as it's just a work shoe, but I wouldn't wear these out on the town... also they don't breath very well, your feet will sweat. Not a big issue though, just put some Gold Bond or baby powder in your socks...<br /><br />All and all I think it's a desirable alternative to traditional work shoes for a fast food worker - but beyond that, I wouldn't buy their clogs for anything but beach shoes maybe... I'm curious about their sandals though - I bet they're not bad.

0195145925|5.0|I read this book about a year ago and it has greatly impacted my thinking about physics, cosmology, and philosophy. 'The End of Time' isn't as charismatically written something like 'The Fabric of the Cosmos', but in it Barbour does a much better job than any other cosmologist I've read at explaining both the history and fundamental concepts behind quantum physics and general relativity. It is clear that his deep understanding has lead him down a path that is, judging by the reviews on this site, unpalatable to both mainstream cosmologists and armchair physicists.<br /><br />I think part of what has thrown off readers is that Barbour doesn't really *sell* his idea. He explains it. And while he's confident, with the hard work done to back up his claims, he's not so much triumphantly declaring all problems solved like many other writers do about their own work. The tone of the book is more professorial and at times it is dense and drags. I think I personally benefit from having a background in genetic algorithms -- visualizing the 'fitness landscape' for a population of genes is intuitively similar to Barbour's idea of 'Platonia' as the realm of all possible configurations of space. Without a doubt, Barbour makes a compelling case for time being absent from the fundamental components of the universe. I'm largely convinced from a logical perspective, to be honest.<br /><br />Like most people, however, the absence of time doesn't resonate quite as well on an intuitive level. I think part of that is the aforementioned professorial (rather than salesman) tone of the book. The other part is that Barbour never wades into the dangerous territory of explaining how our perception of time comes about. I agree that it's a perfectly valid reductionist argument to say the mind is simply its neurons, which in turn are just subsets of space configurations. But it doesn't explain our experience. To be fair, however, I've yet to read in any book how we can experience seemingly linear, forward-moving time in a space-time continuum either.<br /><br />This book isn't for beginners. I don't mean that in any arrogant sort of sense. I found Dieter's 'The Physical Basis of The Direction of Time' far too dense and mathematical for me to follow. But at the same time, this is a deeper book with much bolder ideas than what is often peddled as revolutionary in the cosmology department. So for me it strikes a nice balance between expert and light reading. I recommend it for folks looking for the same.forward-moving time in a space-time continuum either.<br /><br />This book isn't for beginners. I don't mean that in any arrogant sort of sense.

B00783NWB6|1.0|This review here is not about the movie, it is about the \\"digital download\\" which is included.    So I decided to get the BluRay version with the digital copy. This was my first time I ever purchased  an \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy, and boy, what a mistake. I've spent the last two hours signing up on various websites (Sony, UltraViolet, Flixster) just to get this movie to play on my iPad, and it still doesn't work. The entire process is plagued by a horrible user experience, every time you have completed a step, there is another one which just makes you scratch your head. Besides signing up, you will need to install a download manager ... which lets you download the movie, and great, then you have it on your computer, and you still can't move it into your Itunes.    I could go on and on and on, but at this point I've learned my lesson. I just rather go straight to ITunes and purchase it there and done. Not worth the trouble. I'll stay away from anything that says UltraViolet digital copy in the future. What a joke, really.    The user experiences outlined in this article pretty much sums up my experience as well: [...]
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Jon Favreau's \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" looks great, sounds great, and offers one of the best trailers around.  Indeed, for the first fifteen minutes, \\"C&A\\" is a pure delight.<br /><br />But then the movie starts to reek of production notes and \\"suggestions\\" from the money that halt the movie more or less in its tracks, and the result is some fun, innocuous PG-13 pablum.<br /><br />First, the good.  Daniel Craig starts the movie as an anti-hero suffering from amnesia - it's clear he's a rough hombre, but he's also got some bizarre metallic bracelet clamped to his arm that foreshadows the titular aliens.  But this is the Old West, so Craig (whom we eventually learn is arch-gunslinger Jake Lonergan) has absolutely no appreciation for science fiction.  He moves onward.<br /><br />His path seems destined to cross with Harrison Ford, as the dastardly cattle baron Colonel Dolarhyde runs this part of the Old West.  Dolarhyde rules his realm without patience or mercy, and while he'll break his son out of jail (even though the loser belongs there), his son knows that dear old Dad's punishment will be worse than the jail.<br /><br />Just when these two alpha males cross swords, the aliens show up - fantastically.  The aliens fly into town and lasso half the locals in a wonderful set piece.  This sets up the big plot, which involves Dolarhyde and Lonergan leading a motley bunch of pistoleros against the aliens to get their people back.<br /><br />And once we're in pursuit of the aliens, the movie falls apart.  Dolarhyde, it turns out, isn't a great villain, but actually a soft-hearted guy who's just seen too many bad things.  Lonergan is all too willing to leave his bandit days behind.  And soon we're uniting the Law, train robbers, and Apaches in a multicultural raid against the alien stronghold.  All the menace and tension from the first fifteen minutes of the movie - when anyone could kill anyone at any time for less than no reason - has seeped out of the movie, leaving a limp balloon in its place.<br /><br />Fantastic special effects - just as good as anything Favreau did for \\"Ironman\\" - can't quite elevate the movie enough.  While not a bad movie, \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" fails to reach its promise - perhaps if Favreau had cast a bunch of no-name actors instead of Hollywood royalty the movie wouldn't have cost $160 million to make, and then he could have made a great movie of daring and danger.  He did not.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I bought this so I'd have some tools handy in my EDC backpack for work or just life. It seems of good build quality. There is a locking switch on each handle, so you can extend the knife or tool, then you need to disengage the lock to fold the tool back down. It comes in a durable cordura pouch with velcro flap.<br /><br />It seems a bit heavy, but that is likely due to solid materials. It is very handy to have in the pack for whenever it is needed. Definitely recommended.

1846612381|5.0|UP-TO-DATE COMPANION FOR PRACTITIONERS AND LITIGANTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Recently published by Jordans as part of their Family Law series, this book is invaluable to experienced and less experienced practitioners alike.  Not only does it introduce Private Law relating to children, it also provides easy access to summaries of the law and also to policy reports, articles and research.  As mentioned in the Foreword by Sir Nicholas Wall, President of the Family Division, these materials are not always found in standard practice books.<br /><br />The book is also ideal for social work practitioners and, almost uniquely, its clarity and practical approach should make it accessible to the growing number of litigants in person who choose to be unrepresented in court.<br /><br />The contents reflect what, for example, Anthony Hayden QC has recently observed as the ever-evolving concept of the family. `The traditional family structure of a married couple and their co-resident children is declining,' reads the author's footnoted quotation from Population Trends, `...largely due to an increase in the number of households containing cohabiting or lone parents.'<br /><br />Professionals and litigants must therefore cope increasingly within a landscape of, what Mitchell calls `intractable contact disputes', to name only one problem.<br /><br />In a significant number of cases which come to court, litigants have taken entrenched positions often exacerbated by the risk of domestic violence. Practitioners and other professionals contemplating the challenge of this combative legal environment should be reassured considerably by the clear guide to the relevant procedures that this book provides.<br /><br />Thoroughly researched and logically organized, this new third edition, updated throughout makes reference to all recent case law and other important developments, such as the revised Private Law Programme.  The book's 25 chapters cover the full spectrum of issues, from child law and human rights... and children's wishes and feelings through to parental responsibility... contact... expert evidence... and trial.<br /><br />The new chapter on the implications of domestic violence on residence and contact reveals that the definition of this form of violence has gradually expanded to include a wide range of behaviour as indicated by this quotation:  `Indirect violence, threats and verbal abuse may, in certain circumstances be as detrimental as actual violence (in the form of) emotional or psychological abuse as well as physical assault.'<br /><br />Also examined in this volume are such issues as children giving evidence, media access to the courts and the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  ADR - `Alternative Dispute Resolution' is explored as well, including some comments on mediation in practice. The extensive resources for further research include at least twenty-five pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, European materials and other materials, plus six appendices and detailed index.<br /><br />Almost 1,000 pages in length, this is an indispensible work of reference which should certainly find its way to the library of every family law practitioner and other professionals involved in family law.

1846612632|5.0|WITHIN THE EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As the authors of this excellent guide wisely observe, the information revealed and/or demonstrated by trade marks `is essential to the functioning of a competitive market.' The economic function and indeed the economic necessity of trade marks have been so long recognised that it is no longer in dispute.<br /><br />This book carefully examines the ways in which `the indicative value' of trade marks is protected under UK law within the European and international context.<br /><br />The expert authors include Alison Firth - a physicist as well as a barrister and academic; Gary Lea a trade mark consultant and researcher, and Peter Cornford, a Registered Trade Mark Attorney, who, as a practitioner, is responsible for the trade mark portfolios of a number of major clients across a range of industries.<br /><br />As a quick glance at the contents will indicate, the text covers all pertinent aspects of trade mark law and practice, from the aesthetic and commercial complexities, to legal modes of protection to the process of -- and the criteria for -- registration.  Pursuing and defending infringements are also covered, as well as such areas as the assignment of marks and special category marks.<br /><br />The international context is described in detail under such categories as trade marks and European Union Law and the Community Trade Mark (CTM).  The final two chapters examine trade mark systems worldwide and international registration, covering, for example, the Madrid Protocol and the International Trademark Treaty.<br /><br />This new third edition of a well established work of reference has undergone thorough updating to include major new developments, including Trade Marks Rules 2008 and recent UK case law - to name only a few examples.<br /><br />Trademarks and the multiplicity of issues associated with them will inevitably engender copious amounts of case law and this is certainly reflected in this meticulously footnoted work, which includes in total, at least forty-eight pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European and international materials -- plus a detailed index and three appendices containing other relevant materials.<br /><br />No UK trade mark lawyer -- especially one whose practice includes overseas clients -- should be without this thorough, concise and useful book.  The publication date is stated as at March 2012.inevitably engender copious amounts of case law and this is certainly reflected in this meticulously footnoted work, which includes in total, at least forty-eight pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European and international materials -- plus a detailed index and three appendices containing other relevant materials.<br /><br />No UK trade mark lawyer -- especially one whose practice includes overseas clients -- should be without this thorough, concise and useful book.

B004MSWLU8|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.

B0034G4P1W|3.0|We (husband, myself, and first grader) went to watch this movie last weekend, and though my husband hated it, my daughter and I thought it was a fun movie. There is nothing ground-breaking in terms of animation, effects, or plot here - it is what it is - a fun movie that will probably be enjoyed better by kids than by adults.<br /><br />The storyline is simple enough (and I can't compare it to its source work as I've not read the book this is based on) - Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant delivering quite a good voice-over) is a pirate that has seen better days and who has never really achieved any pirating glory. He has however amassed a loyal following in his rag tag crew members, and a pet bird that turns out to be quite, quite unique.<br /><br />Pirate Captain decides he absolutely must enter the Pirate of the Year contest though he is up against some renowned pirates, i.e. sexy female pirate Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek delivering her lines in a swoon-worthy performance) and several other prominent pirates, all of whom have garnered many glories in their pirating adventures. Feeling out of his depth, Pirate Captain decides to give it up but fate of course has other plans.<br /><br />Pirate Captain and his crew, together with naturalist Charles Darwin (David Tennant) find themselves heading to England, where the pirate-hating Queen Victoria dwells. Will Pirate Captain get what he wants, or will he be doomed like other unfortunate pirates who've felt Victoria's wrath?<br /><br />The story moves along at a mercifully quick pace, and the laughs are there, though nothing stellar. My daughter enjoyed the movie and I thought it was good fun too - though of the forgettable variety. The animation in the tradition of Walllace and Gromit is cool and that was the highlight of the movie for me really. Final verdict - great fun for kids.

With that being said let me talk about The Hunger Games. It's writing style is atrocious and hard to get into. It's written in the current first-person, so things like \\"I walk down the road and hear someone calling this book atrocious.\\" If you can get through that type of ilk that's great, it took a while, but hey I got through it. I was 80 pages in and still wondering when anything interesting was going to happen. 100 pages after that and I was STILL bored. The story is not anything new or thrilling. The entire story line is predictable, including the \\"twist\\" at the end, which is easily guessed well before it's ever even mentioned or hinted at. The \\"twist\\" isn't really a twist or surprising...at all. I won't go into spoilers, that's just rude BUT I will say that there are so many other books out there that have better writing, imagery, suspense, character building, love, twists and EVERYTHING else. Please, do yourself and society a favor, pass when it comes to this horrid excuse for a book and find something else.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I VERY much enjoyed the first 2 books in this series, and about 2/3 of this one as well.  While some of the continuing storyline seems to get bogged down in detracting detail, for the most part the first part of the book resumes the action we've grown accustomed to in books 1 and 2.  As things progress however, and the main characters remain continuously separate in one way or another, one starts to wonder how the story will reconcile...<br /><br />Act 3 delivers the type of familiar plot twist the author is famous for.  However, LITERALLY, the second that arrow flies, the book begins to self destruct.  The ending feels vague and unsatisfying, not at all the same calibur as the rest of the storylines. Perhaps it was writer's block.  She didn't know what to do with all the wonderful characters she'd created, and how to resolve their stories - or was somehow rushed into handing in a \\"finished\\" product before she'd thought it fully through. After taking us through the alphabet one letter at a time, at W she suddenly skips to Z.  It truly feels like she had no idea how to re-weave the story threads into a cohesive ending, so instead she hastily chopped the story off at the end, adding an incredibly lame \\"prologue\\" as an attempt to backfill after the fact. That band-aid doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Truly an almost insulting lack of effort - for herself, and her fans.  Ultimately, it's a real disservice to what was otherwise a wonderfully well-crafted story.  Unfortunately, VERY much a let down after two riveting books.

B001PB3RU8|4.0|This album made me feel like I was on a magic carpet ride. It gave me a high and I was not even stoned. The girl has a very annunciated contralto voice similiar to Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane mixed with Enya , Alanis Morrisette and the Cranberries. Their was alot of late Beatles mixed in their too. Like one minute the song would sound one way and switch to totally differant beat mid song. Sometimes the song would pause like it was over and them come back only the notes were being played backwards. At times she sounds like she is singing underwater or into a mason jar. The percussions sounds oddly like a heart beat on some of the tunes. Their is this beautiful of mixture harp and cowbell which makes it sound like heavenly rock music. I love that the music is not turned up so loud that Flo is drowned out. Their was only two songs I really hated. Girl with One Eye and Kiss with a Fist. They were really violent and made me relive a really bad experience. Otherwise was a fairly peaceful album to listen to. The music makes you want to listen to the words and understand what she is trying to say. It made me have visions while I was doing an art /writing project that I wouldn't usually have.

0375704027|4.0|Brief Description: At the start of the book, we meet Toru the businessman on an airplane. As he is getting ready to deplane, he hears the Beatle's song, Norwegian Wood, and it transports him back to the past--to the late 1960s when Toru was a quiet and serious college student who kept mostly to himself. However, a chance encounter with a girl from his hometown, Naoko, leads to a strange and unclassifiable relationship. The two are bound together by the suicide of a mutual friend years before, whose death continues to haunt their lives. Although Toru is doing his best to adapt and fit in with the world, Naoko struggles and eventually seeks help at an asylum. Toru, who finds himself bound to Naoko in ways he doesn't fully understand, is confused when he also finds himself drawn to a sexually liberated and outspoken fellow student, Midori. As Toru attempts to balance his commitment to Naoko and his attraction to Midori, he finds that he can only be free when (as the song says) \\"This bird has flown.\\"<br /><br />My Thoughts: OK ... I'll be upfront about why this book didn't work for me as much as it could have or I wanted it to. The main problem is that I was super-excited to try one of Murakami's fiction books and was prepared and pumped up for weirdness and alternate universes and talking animals and, unknowingly, managed to pick the one fairly straightforward book that Murakami wrote. (I only found this out afterwards. If only I'd read the blurb that said this book was \\"a complete stylistic departure\\" from his mysterious and surreal novels!)  So, I was hoping for surrealism and found, instead, realism. Not to say this was a bad book, but it wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for. (Apparently, I should have chosen The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles or A Wild Sheep Chase instead.) The writing is graceful and fluid, and the story was accessible. Although tinged with melancholy and surprisingly graphic sex scenes/talk, Norwegian Wood ended up being a memorable and haunting coming of age story. It also evokes the strangeness and melancholy of the titular song.ming of age story. It also evokes the strangeness and melancholy of the titular song.

0385534639|4.0|Brief Description: This book has been reviewed on just about every book blog I've seen so I'm not sure I even have to tell you that much about it. However, just in case you aren't familiar with the basics, here they are: A magical circus appears out of blue, only at night. Its colors are always black, white and red. The circus is created and maintained by two magicians, who are in competition with each other. The competition is vague in its goals and ending, even to the two magicians.<br /><br />My Thoughts: OK ... that description sounded a bit flat, but the book itself is not. The main character is really the circus itself, which Morgenstern describes in exquisite and wondrous detail. I love how she described the circus using the second person: \\"You walk through the gates. You see the acrobat.\\" When reading these sections, I felt like I really was walking in the circus and seeing these amazing and mysterious creations. It makes sense that the circus is called the Cirque de Reves (The Circus of Dreams) because it feels like a dream. You know how you have amazingly weird dreams but you can't quite describe them? Morgenstern has somehow figured out how to put the language of dreams onto paper and share it with others. Although I wasn't as rapturous about this book as many others (I'll admit that I almost wanted to dislike it out of a weird sense of contrariness), I have to admit that it captured me in its spell. It really was a magical and otherworldly read that lets you escape into another person's fully realized imagination in the best possible way. If they ever make a movie of this (and it cries out to be made into one), they've got quite a challenge, and it would be a shoo-in for Best Oscar in Art Direction if they get it right.

They hang it in their bedroom, but the author really wants a dead baby in a box instead. (PG 155, Memento Mori) In another section, the author looks at bestial porn (women with dogs and horses) WITH HIS SISTER (PG 173, Town and Country), and in other he talks about buying drugs and acid trips (PG 66).

B0031RAOVY|1.0|This movie isn't worth the one star but I had to pick it.  I am so proud of the other 8 people or so, who saw this movie for what it was which is an absolute disgrace.  It condones animal cruelty.  I kept on waiting for each of the characters to step in and help the dog.  I know the movie is fiction but it is based on a true story from 1923 Japan.  I myself did a search on it to help me stop crying.  In fact, the real dog did go to the station every day but returned to his family home.  Please do not let your children watch this movie.  It is so sad and has no true message except loyalty isn't rewarded.  I am still disturbed by one of the last scenes where Hachi meets up with Joan Allen's character.  How the director couldn't have her scoop him off the street is beyond me.  I was so bothered by this movie, i had to write a review AND i couldn't even bother reading the good reviews.  I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not think that it was a film about animal cruelty.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was a slow start and there were a few boring chapters but as a whole it was a decent read with a cute love story.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|In Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 film, \\"The Iron Lady,\\" the ever-accomplished Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep adds another accent to her repertoire of outstanding characters with distinctive speech patterns that mark their identity.  However, it is not the duplication of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's voice cadence that wins her her third Oscar, it is her ability to play a woman in angst with multi-faceted nuance.  As Thatcher, Streep ripples and reels with the passing of time--for most of the film we see her as an aged oldster missing her now deceased husband with not much to check off on the daily to-do list other than seeing doctors, packing off her hubby's clothing and battling hallucinations.  Why Phyllida Lloyd decides to use Thatcher as a case-in-point for the ephemeral nature of success and the poster child for a modern-day Ozymandias lesson in the inevitable decline of any human, great or small, along with whatever empires they build, seems understandable on the surface, but results in a dreary portrait of \\"The Iron Lady\\" and her myriad of accomplishments within the United Kingdom.<br /><br />Of course, Streep portrays Thatcher in her dotage with a befuddled excellence that entitles her to be thought of as one of today's most brilliant actresses.  As the older Thatcher, she becomes visually disturbing as her mind meanders, chasing after dreams of yesterday as epitomized by the appearance of her deceased husband (played with panache by Jim Broadbent) who reminds and coaxes her to maintain control of whatever is left of her life.  Seeing Thatcher depicted in this way is almost embarrassing and decidedly irreverent.  Should not the woman who was prime minister of the UK longer than anyone else in its history be allowed the perseverance of her private dignity?<br /><br />If writer Abi Morgan's motivation for depicting Thatcher from this vantage point is to garner support for dementia-awareness with unsolicited cooperation from the former prime minister in order to show that it can happen to anyone despite one's former glory, this reviewer supposes that both Morgan and director Lloyd accomplish in projecting this theme.  However, the life of any woman would have done just as well to make this point.  Sadly, anyone expecting to understand the climate and politics of her time at the helm of the British nation will see montages of events like the IRA bombings, her battle with the unions and her mission to reclaim the Falkland Islands but will be ultimately disappointed when attempting to discern her contribution with regard to advancements for women and the British world.<br /><br />Instead of a strong woman who leads an important world nation for over 15 years, the audience sees a woman struggling for her sanity because her physical body is failing.  But what of Thatcher's quick mind?  What of her accomplishments?  Should she not be applauded for her tenacity and ability to stand up to others?  The filmmakers give us a glimpse of this, but focus on Thatcher's deterioration instead of her crested glory.  The resultant film wears thin in the mind of the viewer--the lows are underscored too brutally while the highs are barely explained.<br /><br />Even though Alexandra Roach bristles as the young Margaret Thatcher--she is all about quenching her thirst for change and getting done what she thinks must get done--this reviewer does not get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher really is.  Instead, the image of Streep as the old woman in a world that has passed her by remains steadfast--a cautionary tale almost Buddhist in its leanings towards the insignificance of the world of politics and materialism.  Why bother to strive when what awaits you is forgetfulness, a body that betrays and death?<br /><br />Bottom line?  Phyllida Lloyd's depiction of Margaret Thatcher does not contain enough data about this longest serving British prime minister to consider it a biopic.  Instead, the film, sadly, depicts the trials and tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.  This \\"make hay when the sun shines\\" mentality depresses rather than instills ambition or rallies motivation towards world progress in any positive manner.  Streep excels as the aging Maggie, missing her husband, her son and underling the importance of having some purpose to even the longest days.  Recommended only for those who want to see Streep's award-winning performance and realize this is not an upbeat biographic film bullet-pointing Thatcher's actions during her ministry.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"d tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.

0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and will be carefully not to give away any of the plot.  Turned out to be a good read. Characters, plot, storyline, setting, all captivating. It was a very enjoyable read and I look forward to continuing the series. These books are not for the faint of heart. They are adult themed books with a great deal of descriptive sexual activity. That being said...the book was well written and intriguing. I could not put it down and ordered the other two right away to be able to continue the story. I ordered this book because all of the \\"hype\\" surrounding it, curious as to what the big deal was
0385474547|4.0|As I have come to many conclusions, in regards to Things Fall Apart, none stand out in my mind as clearly and strongly as the commentary the novel makes on the colonialism aspect.<br />Things fall apart is a striking tale that follows the journey of one man, determined to maintain the archetype of \\"man\\" and remain a symbol to his people of utmost masculinity.  The issues that arise come from the conflict that has plagued the continent of Africa since it's exploration.  One cannot help but be taken aback at the stark and lush imagery, as well as the poignant symbolism that we find throughout the pages of the novel.<br /><br />It is so truthful to the plight of the African peoples who have found themselves misplaced in their own country, as a result of the worlds \\"white man's burden\\" nonsense.  It almost reads as a textbook, documenting the history of a people, seen through the eyes of one man's experience.<br /><br />I read this for the first time, and I am senior in college; I cannot believe that this novel was never taught in my high school.  The need for World Literature within the classrooms of the United States is pressing, for the exact reason that we need to see past the borderlines of our nation or more so Western nations.  Anyone who wishes to introduce this aspect of World culture should seriously look into this book!
B000002GZ1|5.0|Reviewer BOB's one-star dismissal of this CD is pretty startling, isn't it? Did he even bother listening to the album? I recently gave another blues album a two-star rating because the sound was muddy and distorted, often with a tinny echo that made it sound like the recording was done with a tin can in someone's back bedroom. I shudder to think of what one star might mean.<br /><br />Except his isn't remotely close to being a one-star This particular CD was mastered in 1988 by Digital Magnetics. I assume it was a tape to digital rendering that kept the same dynamic range as recorded in the studio. This means it would be slightly better than a tape to vinyl transfer from the 60's, since these typically involved some signal compression.<br /><br />But the proof is in the pudding. How does this CD actually sound? I've played it on an audiophile quality 7.1 DSP system. The transfer sounded very clean. No hisses, pops, etc. The dynamic range was good but perhaps not great. The CD is at least as good as the original album. And for those who need further convincing, this 1965 release peaked st #123 on the Billboard top albums chart. Rolling Stone rates it as #476 on its top 500 list.<br /><br />Should you get this particular album? BOB says to get the British remastered import. Those who have say it sounds just the same as this CD. If you want a good version of the original, get this album. If you want a more synoptic and perhaps more economical rendition, get the Paul Butterfield Anthology: The Elektra Years album. This, by the way, uses 1997 remasterings.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I have eight complete sets of these wonderful symphonies. Not to mention a smattering of individual recordings.<br />So, when I finished listening to these fine recordings, I went to Amazon, intent on writing a glowing review. A bunch of you beat me to it!<br /><br />Really, I was not familiar with Gary Bertini, and had heard of the Cologne Radio Symphony but never thought about them. These recordings really opened my eyes and my ears.  Not only are the performances first rate, but the recorded sound is excellent; depth, clarity and breadth. If someone had told me this was Bernstein, Solti or Barbirolli(still my favorite Sixth!) and that the orchestra was London, Boston, Chicago or Berlin I would have believed it. What  great integrated performances, and what beautiful sound. Unusually clear for an EMI issue.<br /> I could live on a desert island with this set easily.  Buy this set before some goof-ball at EMI decides to have it deleted.<br /><br />A Mahlerite from the Sixties.
B00002DE4L|4.0|The album is what it says it is: a soundtrack. All of the songs you heard in the movie are here.<br />I left off a star, however, because I really, really hate the version of \\"The Flame Still Burns\\" that's on here. It's basically the same song sung by Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy in the film, but they've add an unnecessary group of back-up singers to vomit over the last few minutes of the song. Utterly terrible, and it ruins what is otherwise a beautiful piece. I always have to stop or fast forward before they cut in.

0061743526|5.0|In, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, we see two parts with two problems that are developed over time. In Part 1, we see the setting of a \\"sleepy Southern town,\\" in this case, Maycomb County in the year 1935. This part talks about mainly Scout and Jem coping with the people that they do not particularly favor and trying to get along with them. There are three important characters that have major roles in this story. Scout is an eight year old girl who cares for her brother and father and is expected to grow up. Jem is the older brother of Scout and also copes with growing up. Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout and is a righteous man and lawyer. In Part 2, we see a real visible conflict in which there is a young, black man named Tom Robinson who is convicted of raping white Mayella Ewell, the son of Bob Ewell (who also has a relatively big part in this story). We also see the scene where Scout is at the school play and things start to unfold.<br /><br />The pace in this novel is not too slow and not too fast; events happen at a realistic pace. The characters in this story were likeable because you have the conflicting sides of good people and bad people. The good people in this story, such as Scout and Atticus, are troubled with the people who claim to be let's say innocent but nobody knows what to think. I think the theme of this novel is to respect the dignity that belongs to us all and/or respect those who may not seem respectable.<br /><br />I would recommend this classic novel to those who are looking for an example of human rights offenses and defenses and those who are looking for a fantastic and classic read.

B0073XORCY|4.0|I dislike the opening, but the album picks up speed quickly.<br /><br />There's nothing I'm humming from it yet, but I am using it as background while I work during my commute and find myself stopping to listen to the lyrics often.<br /><br />The music is Tull in feel, if that makes any sense, so the cast list doesn't seem to impact me as much as it has others. I wasn't grabbed by the original TAAB on first listen either and I don't rate Tull/Anderson albums based on one hearing.<br /><br />It's pleasant, tells an interesting story with one or two clever tricks. Does it push the envelope? No, I don't think so. Will you recognize trademark details (aka \\"cliches\\")? Maybe. Musicians do that. It's called \\"style\\" or \\"sound\\" when people like it and cliche when they don't.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I spent the money on this one, and a Tull/Anderson album is far from an automatic purchase for me. I think the last conteporary Tull album I bought was Roots to Branches a good 15 years and more ago. I have bought some of their back catalog in the last 12 months and generally like what they were doing pre-Minstral and post Warchild better than the bits in between but it's not like I'm stuck in Aqualung refusing to believe the war is over.<br /><br />Give this one a try, but don't expect it to be the sonic equivalent of a faster than light star drive or a new universal antibiotic. Enjoy it for what it is.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Paranormal Activity is now a bit like Saw in that it's starting to pump out sequels that don't hold up to the original, however I do like the series a lot better than Saw because it harkens back to the better days of horror a-la the Changeling. The film isn't gory or violent, I don't think there's a drop of blood in it, and it just goes to show that horror and violence don't need to be synonymous.<br /><br />The story itself is very simple too, if you look at the cover and the title you pretty much know what to expect, however I really liked the whole style of it, the husband's a camera nut who wants to film everything and this is part of the brilliance of the film's technique. There will be long uneventful shots where nothing is going on yet the audience is holding their breath waiting for something to move, maybe out the corner of their eye. Subtelty and patience are key here, Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.<br /><br />Other scares are very well set up, the wife standing abover her husband for hours still sends chills down my spine, and the priest walking in the house for one second then immediately turning on his heels was pretty creepy as well; all without a drop of blood. However the ending I watched (in theaters) was pretty disappointing, *spoilers* the guy leaves the room, then gets thrown into the camera for a jump scare, then the wife looks into the camera lens and tries to bite it or something. That was a bit anti-climactic and I would've given the movie 3 stars had I not seen the original ending. If you haven't seen it basically the producers realized they could make a franchise out of Paranormal Activity(they were right) so they altered the original ending into some vague jump scare so they could set up the sequels instead of sticking with the far creepier original.<br /><br />I'm probably wasting my time reviewing this, people already know the series and whether or not they like it, however I really like Paranormal Activity (the 1st one) because it shows that American horror that doesn't resort to blood and guts is still around.ws that American horror that doesn't resort to blood and guts is still around.

Hist stuff gets played more often to more people when I entertain. My kid grew up discussing his works with me and playing with the CD-ROM tour of his farm.<br /><br />I don't think there's a performance on this disc I actually like (I was an early adopter so I have the one without all the bonus materials and \\"Selling England By The Pound last track side one\\" for doing that).<br /><br />In recent years I've had the dubious \\"pleasure\\" of eagerly cueing up a favourite artist's cover version of a song I've loved and said \\"no-one could make a balls-up of this\\" only to be shown the paucity of my powers of imagination and prediction.<br /><br />\\"Heroes\\" was awful. It is the remake of \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\" in sound, stripping away some of the text and all of the depth of the original.<br /><br />From there the experience didn't improve significantly for me. I was left bewildered, wondering why on Earth anyone would bother to make such a dirge collection. It certainly was not worth the wait since Up from where I was standing, scratching my head.<br /><br />I've had the disc for months now and had absolutely no inclination to replay it.

My kid grew up litening to his stuff and we used to play for hours with the CD-ROM tour of his farm when she was a toddler.<br /><br />But I have to say I find these orchestral experiments a very mixed bag and I can't say that any of the treatments changes the experience of a particular piece for the better (in my opinion, naturally).<br /><br />From my point of view some of the pieces work well, some rather less well and some are total duds. It seemed to me that these arrangements lacked the dynamic feel and immediacy of the band arrangements.<br /><br />I'm not talking about the difference in feel between live and studio performance here either. The version of Solisbury Hill on the first live album left me slack-jawed with amazement that the piece could be given that heavy a touch, and I prefer the version of Digging in the Dirt from Secret World Live to the one on Us.<br /><br />I simply feel the orchestral arrangements were turgid and uninspiring in places, more than they were innovative and entertaining, and the album was for me a disappointing experience overall.<br /><br />I saw the iMax film of this performance a few months ago and while the visual presentation certainly added to the experience I left that with mixed feelings too, though there I could at least verify that the orchestra was trying hard to rise above it all. I can't decide whether the problem is in the material not being well-suited to an orchestral treatment or that the &#34;sparse&#34; effect deliberately sought by the composer and arranger was just above my head.<br /><br />As an experiment it is worth a listen, but I don't think I'll be playing this album much. Maybe odd tracks, now and again.<br /><br />Your mileage will certainly vary.

B003NHRIUW|4.0|As i was watching this film,and i will give you a bit of a prologue,to judge what follows,i thought of a very young<br />brooke shields and was she involved with calvin klein,and i recall two of the film she made the blue lagoon(why blue?)which was released with much fanfare and promotion and JUst you and me kid with george burns who also did the sunshine boys and oh god (with bob denver a favorite singer of my youth)...the critics didnt particularly like her film roles,i thought the Burns film was cute but i list all these things and her domineering/controlling mother,the imagery created and put into our minds to interest us in her,but she seemed away from the imagery to be a nice person,its just what was trying to be created which was wrong,and her film career didnt last and she made a tv show and i see her now and then. Much more prominent i recall Burns sidekick gracie allen,one of my favorite people from early tv land who was funny and deflating of much that needed and was wrong in a wistful air...i laugh when i think of her with nostalgia. Anyways i saw this film,and i was not knowing what to get from the famous tv show she created and the neon intensity and much else is toned down and her acting is apropos and the film is actually good for someone whoose acting is not their bread and butter...she's famous in other media. We begin the film with her fighting with a younger brother(of course in contemporary life she's trying to rear him)and having gone through some<br />problem with the law and whoose mother leaves her with brother and father and her mom's mind is on marrying. A contemporary situation revisited in many homes. She is then made a pass at at a carnival scene near the water(this imagery is attractive,as well as the area where it was filmed)and is derisive toward her attacker, who attempts to unsuccessfully make a pass at night in another location. Then while all this is ongoing,we have a raccoon in the environment,as near all waters,they are not somuch parasitic,they actually ward off other parasites much worse,<br />but the minds of all are disturbed by these pests. There is a good scene with this male where she likes and admits she has fun and shakes hands with the romantic male,fun and intimacy here are linked in her mind,a reader of dense fiction including the realistic tolstoy(i think he is)and while this is ongoing the young child wants the family back together,a child's imposition on the adult world,but the adults have their own way,and the father seems nice and dreamy as he's called,but seems to be existing rather than liking anything that's ongoing. Miley's interlocutor is depicted as having many girlfriends,and he is going through the rituals but now he has found love,his emotional centers have been touched.then there is a subplot about a burning church,and a wedding scene,and a theme in the film is how wealthy people cause the city to decline in all kind of ways,and not so much them but those they influence,and there is a scene at a wedding where a poor and uneducated person takes his class hatred out by pummelling this guy and trying to take away this girl...these kinds of tensions are on the rise these days. The film works since it radiates from miley as she is the center of the film,and we learn throughout the film as people interact with her,and it's an interesting film,as from an estranged person she develops some values and goes through a love and sensual series of events but then develops her reason and reflection and adequately deals with a dieing father and a boyfriend. She seems believable,and the film is different than what i expected...actually storylines and subject matter in female characters i like. I hope in future films she's able to develop her talents,in film,an area not her home but where she can develop a comfort zone..notice the names in this film the boy is jonah and one of the girls blake i think...what imagery is there?

B001HN69AY|5.0|When Heath Ledger, Jude Law and Johnny Depp all play the same character (Tony, the philanthropist), you know you've got one heck of a movie.<br /><br />Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) has made a deal with the devil, and now he's trying to renegotiate it. Fortunately, the devil is a gambling man (naturally), so they come up with a bet to avoid Parnassus having to turn over his beautiful daughter Valentina (Lily Cole). The old doc knows some real magic, and he is immortal, but that doesn't mean he can win a contest with another magic-working immortal.<br /><br />But Parnassus has help. Said Valentina, of course, although she doesn't learn why until later; and his faithful Anton (Andrew Garfield), who plays Mercury in the carny side-show called, appropriately enough, the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Percy is also a great help and very wise, and possibly immortal himself: he's played by Verne Troyer, whom you may remember as Griphook the Goblin in Harry Potter. He distinguishes himself from a midget by saying that if he were to quit the show, Parnassus would have to hire a midget, \\"a little taller than me.\\"<br /><br />And then there's Tony (Heath Ledger, at first). Valentina, Anton and Percy fish him out from under a bridge, where he is hanging by his neck, but not quite dead. When he wakes up, he has no memory of who he is or why he had been hanged. Valentina calls him George, but eventually we discover that he is Tony, a philanthropist who is somehow in disgrace and in the newspapers as a liar.<br /><br />Then there's the mirror. It's actually just a couple of pieces of shiny mylar split in the middle so one can go through it. But you don't just end up backstage in the carnival cart. Where you end up depends entirely on Imagination. Yours? Parnassus'? Not clear. But Doctor Parnassus has to be in a trance for it to work at all. At one point Tony jumps through and just finds himself in the back of the cart because Parnassus was not in a trance. He was, however, drunk.<br /><br />Fun and frantic and with many sly little digs at the foibles of people who come to see the show. And mostly, rich with imagination.r, drunk.<br /><br />Fun and frantic and with many sly little digs at the foibles of people who come to see the show. And mostly, rich with imagination.
1594202842|1.0|a book that is well written crap by highly educated woman. I cannot describe this book more than this.<br />Even from the start, I was very disappointed how she could limited freedom of her children, when she wanted to raise them as Chinese-\\"American\\". America is all about freedom, love, diversity and those traits defined and defines America for long time; yet she does not realize that her way of parenting is actually digression from core \\"American thoughts\\". At least, that is the essential thoughts of Founding Fathers. (or if I'm wrong, just let's go with it.:D)<br /><br />I was also highly disappointed how she stereotypes people and is VERY biased against people who does not seems \\"appropriate\\" for her. O gosh, when I read the first chapter, I was highly highly disappointed when she wrote, \\"Not just any activity, like \\"crafts,\\" which can lead nowhere-- or even worse, playing the drums, which leads to drugs-- but rather a hobby that was meaningful and highly difficult with the potential for depth and virtuosity (Chua 9).\\"<br /><br />I cannot believe this book \\"was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones\\", as her preface says it. I am highly disappointed and bothered.*
B00005JPD0|4.0|This movie has been publicized in a way that makes it sound like a paranormal fantasy story. But the fact is, there is a science-fiction type explanation for why ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) knows what's going to happen. I can't explain it rationally, because I don't really understand, so don't worry about a spoiler in that direction.<br /><br />What really gets Doug involved in this situation is not just his job: it's the beautiful Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) whom he first sees as a corpse. But if he can change the course of events, she will survive. He's motivated.<br /><br />The basic story is a huge explosion on a ferry boat in New Orleans that kills over 800 people. Agent Carlin is there to investigate, discovers that it was caused by a bomb, and begins to track the bomber. He is soon asked to join a highly classified research team that may be able to help. Here's where the science fiction part comes in, and is probably designed to confuse you.<br /><br />There's plenty of wild chases and explosions and gun play, if that's the sort of thing you like. But there's a great deal more to the story than that. In fact, I found much of the mayhem a distraction from trying to follow the story line when it refuses to stay linear.<br /><br />Hope I haven't already said too much. I bet you'll enjoy this one.

B002CLBJPK|3.0|Well, this is one I know I never saw before. It's a combination of live action and animation, a technique Disney pioneered with \\"Mary Poppins\\" in 1964. This movie is not as effective as that one, but it's good fun.<br /><br />Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) lives in a remote village, and is asked (no, ordered, actually) to take in three London orphans during the World War II bombing raids on London. Carrie is the oldest and a practical girl, then Charlie is the middle child and a skeptic, and Paul is the youngest. The magical bedknob is given to him.<br /><br />Miss Price is an apprentice witch who has been taking correspondence lessons from an old fraud in London, Emelius Browne, but he closes the school before she gets the promised last lesson. Since she considers it of vital importance to her secret war work, she and the children take the enchanted bed to London to find Professor Browne. He's not much like any of them imagined him to be.<br /><br />The magic in the story is surprisingly authentic in this regard: it all depends on the capabilities of the witch, not on the incantations. Browne had been a total fake, but Miss Price was able to work the spells (not always quite the way she wanted) because she had a talent of her own.<br /><br />The best part is when they go to the Island of Naboombu, which is all done with cartoons. The country is run by animals, who talk and wear clothes and act rather human, but who don't like humans. The King (a lion, of course) drafts Browne to be referee in a soccer match that has got to be the craziest one ever played. Quidditch has got nothing on these guys! The reason they were there, and also why they went to Portabello Road in search of half an old book, takes too long to explain. Let's just say a good bit of it was an excuse for some considerable music and dancing. I grew impatient with the humans on Portabello Road, but the fish in the lagoon at Namboombu were fun.<br /><br />It's a very silly movie, with some things in common with Mary Poppins, but it is fun. I'd share it with children or grandchildren if I had any, but possibly not without considerable explanation.on with Mary Poppins, but it is fun.

B007FH9GT2|1.0|I am currently half way through the second book in this trilogy and decided to watch this movie because I liked what I have read so far.<br /><br />I am not griping because this movie doesn't adhere well to the book. I KNOW that movies can't always follow the book and sometimes it's better to rewrite stuff to make it better for a movie.  I like to watch movies based on books as if they were not and judge them as stand-alone stories, ya know?  That said...<br /><br />1) I think it spoiled the second book for me which I'm only half way done with. In the second book, \\"all the evil that happened\\" is a big mystery, and unfortunately, I think Lisbeth spilled the beans about what \\"all the evil is\\" at the end of this movie.  I was really upset that the makers of this movie did that.  She is supposed to be painfully private and she reveals a secret to Mikeal so willingly that it's like the writer's just gave up trying to capture the essence of who she is. She would have never talked about her past like that. Ever. Not even to Mikeal, and especially not so soon after knowing him. I understand movies have to be different than the books, but that was ridiculous. But the fact that I think this movie reveals something that is a mystery in the second book really pisses me off. After I finish the second book, I'll come back and tell you what I think.<br /><br />2) Um, editing and sound quality suck. We watched HD and it still sucked. If we didn't already know what was supposed to be going on, we'd have been totally lost. We couldn't understand what they were saying half the time because they were mumbling and muffled and there was too much background noise/music.<br /><br />3) Way too many montages where they are researching. I know that's a big deal in the story, but come on, I don't want to sit and watch 30 minutes straight of artsy-filmed research montages where it's not even clear what they are researching.
B000E41MRC|1.0|This is the classic of propaganda, the one everyone who wants to understand Nazi Germany and the phenomenon of propaganda has to see sooner or later. It is a narration of the 6th annual Nazi Party conference, with lots and lots of marching and martial music and bombastic speeches. Aside from its chilling historical significance, it's pretty damned boring.<br /><br />There are scenes of smiling children and women cheering and saluting, and one rather odd one of the strapping young men washing up and getting ready for breakfast. Mainly, it is a story of scale. And of incredible discipline, uniformity, suppression of the slightest individuality.<br /><br />Also, Hitler has this persistent cowlick at the back of his head, and reads from a prepared speech at the end of the conference. At one point, he mentioned 200,000 party members, which means that there were a heck of a lot more than party members there. With those orderly rows, you can count them like eggs in a crate: multiplication can give you a quick estimate, and my sense is that the total crowd that was arranged in orderly rows was closer to 500,000. Then there were a significant number on the sidelines as spectators, so the total mob may well have been closer to a million.<br /><br />That was the big point to making the film, of course: that we have lots and lots of very well disciplined men in uniform, and we will be the only force in Germany. Left unsaid was that they also were determined to be the only force in Europe.

B000IZ8SD8|5.0|OK, at least one of those five stars is just for Patrick Stewart, for whom I have considerable lust. I understand this is the second of the Next Gen series. I really must get the rest.<br /><br />As hard-core fans know, Zefram Cochrane made his historical first warp flight on April 5, 2063.  Anyway, it turns out that the Borg took a time warp back to the day before in order to destroy Cochrane and his ship, thereby preventing first contact and making the population of earth easy to assimilate. Since this would destroy the time line on which the Enterprise exists, it has to be stopped.<br /><br />So the Enterprise goes back in time (the method is a clever one; I won't reveal it), following the Borg to try to stop them and protect Cochrane and his warp ship. Try? Why do I say try? Captain Picard does not merely try things; he succeeds. How he succeeds is one very good adventure story. Complicated, as all time travel stories are, but it is possible to follow it.<br /><br />Zefram Cochrane is a fascinating character; he even manages to get Deanna Troi drunk! The Borg Queen shows up, trying to seduce Data and then the Captain. Data even gets some real skin! But of course our intrepid heroes win in the end; otherwise they wouldn't exist in the 24th century, and we know they do

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is one of the HBO feature-length films that keep nagging at me to get a TV with HBO and History Channel and a few other good things.<br /><br />As most people know by now, Temple Grandin was diagnosed with autism at the age of four. The doctor who diagnosed her pronounced it like a life sentence. Her mother was simply not having any of this \\"put her in an institution\\" (implied: and forget about her), and gradually adapted home-schooling methods to her needs. We see the boarding high school and how others came to accept her -- or not -- and her college. But the most interesting part comes after she realizes what she wants to do is study animal husbandry, in part because she found a high level of rapport with the animals on her aunt's ranch when she spent the summer there between high school and college.<br /><br />Temple was not only brilliant, but lucky. She had a few teachers and other mentors who showed up at the right times to give her a chance. Not that there weren't problems; there were plenty. One big one was that her stock handling designs were revolutionary, built to reduce the stress and fear in the animals right up to the moment of slaughter. The ignorance and, in some cases, wanton cruelty of some of the stock handlers was appalling.<br /><br />Her first really original design was for a dipping system where cattle could be put into a flea bath without trauma, and swim quite placidly to the other end, climb out on their own, and not drown or panic or cause problems for the handlers. She demonstrated it for a stockman's journalist the day before the official showing, and it worked beautifully. The writer was very impressed, and wrote a very favorable article. But the next day, which was supposed to be the regular press briefing and demonstration, the stock handlers changed her design in all the wrong ways before she even arrived on the scene. They completely ruined it, so that the only record of the real design was in the magazine article by the guy who had seen it the day before.<br /><br />When she came to apply her principles to the animals heading into the slaughter house, she also encountered resistance. The first argument, predictably, was that it would be too expensive. But she stood up to them and pointed out all the ways they would save money in the long run, and eventually they bought into the ideas.<br /><br />The last scene may indeed be the best. Temple and her mother go to an Autism conference, and in typical Temple manner, she spoke up to correct a speaker's blatant error. Someone naturally asked her how old her child was, and when she said she didn't have any children, they smirked on the assumption that she had no idea what she was talking about. But when she began to tell her story, including the fact that she had both a bachelor's and master's degree, and was working on a doctorate, they wanted to hear everything.<br /><br />This wonderful woman is a living testament to the idea that we must take people seriously for their abilities and their spirit, not dismiss them as a diagnosis. She's used her autism to her advantage in many ways, and to the advantage of animals everywhere, and the people who love them and the people who eat them.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games series is absolutely remarkable. A great read however, I must caution parents... There is a maturity level that should be obtained and an open mind. I, myself would not let a 12 year old sit down with this book due to its content. It is a wonderful book for your 16 and up year old. You know if this book may put \\"ideas\\" in your child's head. I suggest you read the book first, then decide. A lot of parents are aseptically about the book. I recently saw the movie and the scenes in the book are more descriptive, should i say, in the book than the movie. It is definitely a wonderful read.<br /><br />Other than that, this book (and series as a whole) is amazing. I haven't read a series this captivating since HARRY POTTER. It left me begging for more. Wonderful book. Will instantly hook you. As as I did, you will probably lose sleep either reading it, or thinking about it.  It is that wonderful, yes. Highly suggest this . Worth the money.

B00004RF83|4.0|President Jordan Lyman (Frederic March) has just signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. Some people love it, and some hate it. Among those who hate it is General James Scott (Burt Lancaster) and a group of his cronies. His assistant, Col. Martin \\"Jiggs\\" Casey (Kirk Douglas), is loyal to him and therefore opposes the treaty as well. But when Jiggs discovers that Gen. Scott is plotting something nefarious (sorry; won't spoil it by telling you what; just think early 1960s technology), he goes to the president with what he knows.<br /><br />What follows is a scramble to foil the plot, with President Lyman unsure of whom he can trust. It's a complex story, and an exciting one, but without the blood and bombs generally associated with military stories in the 21st century.<br /><br />The movie has become a classic for very good reasons, among them a star-studded cast. Ava Gardner, Edmund O'Brien and Martin Balsam are just three of the familiar faces in addition to the brilliant stars of Lancaster, Douglas and March.
B004C6QCT6|1.0|ZEBOP! is a crazily compromised album. Where MARATHON represented an interesting interlude, the path that the Santana band would subsequently take was one of great commercial dividends with music that now sounds very dated.<br /><br />The driving percussion has almost disappeared from the Eighties version of this once-great band.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of trying to find 'soulful' or 'passionate' Santana music from the albums MARATHON through to BEYOND APPEARANCES.<br /><br />These albums represent the shadow of Santana. Lots of Top Ten hits, studio sheen and nostalgia galore.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Santana rarely, if ever, plays the material from ZEBOP! or its surrounding albums in concert.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A spectacular finale to a spectacular series! If you have not read the books, you have lots of surprises in store. If you have, there are enough differences, and enough surprises in the way events are depicted that I'm sure you will love it anyway. Of course if you have not seen the earlier movies, it's probably a good idea if you do that first, at least Deathly Hallows Part 1.<br /><br />As the story opens, Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementers, and Snape is now the headmaster. The place has changed enormously, of course. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) realizes that the last horcrux must be at Hogwarts, and returns there to find it. What he finds, of course, is a huge amount of trouble.<br /><br />Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are with him, of course, and as soon as they manage to sneak into Hogwarts, they find that Dumbledore's Army is ready to fight. Which is good, because Voldemort is amassing a huge army of death eaters just outside the grounds.<br /><br />It's a magnificent battle, and I won't ruin a thing by telling you any details. Eventually, of course, it comes down to Harry versus Voldemort mano a mano. But first we have the revelations involved in Snape's final tears. Harry collects them and, on Snape's instructions, pours them into the pensieve. What he discovers there is the key to winning the battle against Voldemort.<br /><br />For the romantically minded, there's an epilogue 19 years later, where we get to see what couples are now sending their children to Hogwarts. I believe one couple mentioned in the book is missing, but perhaps they are in the background where I missed them. I suspect long-time fans can predict who has paired up with whom.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great cooler and at a price low enough there's no reason not to buy it. The install is easy and the heatsink is very well built but the instructions are awful and poorly illustrated. Find an install video on Youtube instead, and you can pop it in within ten minutes. Be aware that it needs a backplate so it could be an issue with a motherboard already in place if there is not a cutout behind the motherboard tray.<br />During a new build I usually install this cooler first, along with the RAM, and then gingerly lower it into the case. Another issue reported by some is the size. Although it's not huge as coolers go, on a cramped board it can overhand the memory slots and interfere with heat spreaders. I've put several of these into various Asus boards without a problem, usually using Ripjaws memory, and in either a Lancool K62 or Antec 300 case.
0800141601|4.0|I think Sean Connery is absolutely perfect as King Arthur. And Richard Gere makes quite a good Lancelot. Julia Ormond is a fine Guinevere. So why only four stars instead of five? A little too much emphasis on battles for my taste.<br /><br />The story is very familiar in basic outline, although this one does not contend that Guinevere and Lancelot were actually lovers in the sexual sense. Lancelot is a marvelous hero, and rescues Guinevere from a horrible villain more than once under amazing circumstances. And by that I mean the same horrible villain, one Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), who is just about as bloodthirsty and vicious as anyone could ask for in a villain.<br /><br />It's not hard to imagine loving two men when the two are as magnificent as Connery and Gere.

So I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Apparently rugby is sort of like American football without all the padding. All I knew of it before this was that when I was at the University of Michigan, the rugby team was the toughest bunch of SOBs I'd ever met. They were all human bulldogs.

By 1994, they had exactly one black player. Mandela realized that putting the country together was going to take more than laws prohibiting discrimination. It was going to take people coming together willingly. He correctly realized that a winning rugby team could do that.<br /><br />The black kids mostly played soccer (called \\"football\\" outside of America), partly because the Springboks were so hated. But at Mandela's suggestion, Pienaar took the team on good will tours to the small towns and taught the kids to play rugby. They loved it, and started cheering for the Springboks when they started winning big.<br /><br />The movie does not make it clear exactly what made the Bokke turn into such a good team from what had been a rather pathetic one, except to suggest that Pienaar drove them harder than they'd been driven before. But he had been captain through their ho-hum years, so that's not a very satisfying explanation.<br /><br />The final game, which was against New Zealand, could make a rugby fan out of anyone, even me. It was an amazing game in several respects, and Clint Eastwood is just the director to make it comprehensible. Several of the decisive plays are done in slow motion, which I suppose makes up for the TV instant replay habit.<br /><br />Before the game, the New Zealand team does a Maori war dance, which is every bit as intimidating as they intend it to be. But it is rather odd to see what are clearly white players (although their biggest and meanest looks like a native) doing a chant and coordinated dance.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, for all its flaws, and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is generally a sports fan. Even if you're not, you may surprise yourself.<br /><br />P.S. The title of the movie is the title of a poem I memorized in sixth grade. We were each told to choose one to memorize, and I chose this strong-minded one to try to improve my courage. Did it work? I don't really know.he decisive plays are done in slow motion, which I suppose makes up for the TV instant replay habit.<br /><br />Before the game, the New Zealand team does a Maori war dance, which is every bit as intimidating as they intend it to be.

B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book is amazing. I love the entire series.<br />That out of the way, wow there are typos! All over this thing! I don't remember my paperback having so many....
B0013ND30M|3.0|This is one I really had not seen before. It was in theaters when I was 12 years old, and clearly too mature for such things, at least when they cost money. I have seen stills and short segments from it, probably on the Disney TV show, but I know I never saw the whole thing.<br /><br />The art is quite a departure from earlier Disney animation, and indeed looks like it may have been a cost-cutting measure. It's quite angular in style, and uses a lot more flat, unrealistic backgrounds and crowd scenes. Princess Aurora is pretty enough, and the Prince Philip is handsome, but they don't have fully rounded, shaded features. The look like flat cartoons.<br /><br />The story is of course the familiar traditional one, adapted as Disney always does adapt. Princess is born after long years of wanting by the King and Queen, at which point she is betrothed to the boy prince from the neighboring kingdom, Prince Philip. Her three fairy godmothers can each offer her one gift. The first offers her great beauty, the second a marvelous singing voice, and just as the third is about to bestow her gift, the evil witch, Malificent, shows up and pronounces a curse. The third fairy godmother attempts to mitigate the curse, but for security, her fairy godmothers give up magic to take her into the forest to be raised anonymously. They give her the name Briar Rose.<br /><br />The curse was to take effect on her 16th birthday, \\"before the sun sets,\\" so of course she has to meet the handsome prince in the forest the day before. She doesn't know who he is and he doesn't know who she is, but of course they fall in love. Each one is then chastised for shirking their duty to marry royalty, without anyone ever guessing that they both are royalty, and are in fact betrothed.<br /><br />Hard to believe, but so it the ease with which Malificent is overthrown. Then Aurora is awakened by Loves First Kiss, and everything is la la la. With better art, and better advantage made of Tchaikovsky's marvelous Sleeping Beauty ballet, I might have more respect.eeping Beauty ballet, I might have more respect.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the latest vision is terrific...thanks God, thanks developers. the plan shows up more friendly, I'll keep going with his words.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|OK, I know what happened. I don't think I ever saw this in a theater, and I'm pretty sure I never saw it in color. We only had a black and white TV in the days when I was watching the Disney TV show, and this movie was originally 1 1/4 hour long. So when it was on TV, it was cut to fit an hour-long show minus time for commercials. I think the cutting must have been pretty artful, because the parts I don't remember were not all that germane to the story. But one that helps understand what happened to Alice is the part before she followed the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole. She sings a song about a world of her own, where everything is nonsense. And of course elements of the song show up later in her adventures underground.<br /><br />One thing I've always disliked about the Disney adaptation is that it took things from both Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, and mashed them together in such a way that my generation grew up not even realizing we were talking about two different books.<br /><br />This movie is an old friend, and indeed I took a dozen screen shots to keep. I think the artwork has survived my adulthood rather better than the story as a whole. Still, this is a fun one, and if you want to share it with your children and/or grandchildren, be sure to follow up with the originals, hopefully with the Tenniel drawings.
0743277457|4.0|INTRODUCTION<br /><br />Waitzkin was a chess prodigy, dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years. He picked up Tai Chi and became so proficient within a few years that he became World Champion in 'Push Hands', the martial aspect of Tai Chi. He realized that competitive chess psychology could readily be applied in Tai Chi, and that his insights from Tai Chi also influenced his chessplay. Waitzkin contends that there are many principles of learning and performance common to many disciplines, even outwardly unrelated ones like Chess and Tai Chi. This book weaves these principles into his riveting autobiography of his competitive careers. His illustrations draw from his competitive experience, but his ideas are probably useful in general.<br /><br />ESSENCE<br /><br />Make your work an expression of your innate nature to 'stay true' to your art and avoid alienating your art from your character. [pages 9, 41, 80]<br /><br />Children who are praised using \\"you're so smart\\" can become 'Entity Learners' who easily give up on anything they're not really good at. They believe that to be good in something, you need to have this quality ('entity') of talent in it. 'Incremental Learners', on the other hand, thrive on praise like \\"keep up the good work\\" because they believe they can master anything by working hard. In the face of failure, Incremental Learners raise their game while Entity Learners run away and lose a growth opportunity. [30, 44]<br /><br />Learning is an alternating sequence of static, safe mediocrity and vulnerable growth periods. When fixing our flaws or trying new techniques, our ability weakens temporarily ('Investment in Loss'), which Incremental Learners can endure but Entity Learners avoid. [33, 107]<br /><br />Many understand that having zero distractions helps one concentrate better. That is termed the 'Hard Zone', which unfortunately is not always a possible environment to maintain when we need to concentrate. A much better alternative is the 'Soft Zone', were we incorporate distractions, including our emotions, into our thoughts, using them as fuel for creative insights. For instance, tunes in Waitzkin's head disrupted his chessplay until he thought to the beat of the music, allowing the music to influence his style of play creatively. [54, 126, 207]<br /><br />Techniques and knowledge can be internalized via much practice, something like 'carving neural pathways'. [138] Eventually, internalized skills are integrated into the 'unconscious skillset' that we wield powerfully without knowing. [140, 231]<br /><br />If one grasps the essence behind a skill, he can repeatedly practice the reduction of the actions that implement the skill, yet retain the essence ('Making Smaller Circles'). Eventually, powerful skills can become nearly invisible, such as Bruce Lee's sledgehammer 'six-inch punch'. [121]<br /><br />By focusing on a small data set (e.g. a certain hand of a fighting opponent), our brain can process things in higher frames-per-second, 'slowing down time'. This can be done without ignoring the rest of the data; the rest is left to the 'unconscious skillset' to deal with instinctively. [146] Waitzkin has used this to attack opponents when they are in the midst of blinking.<br /><br />The highest stage of any competitive sport is psychological warfare - the reading and controlling of intention. To quote a 19th-century sage on Tai Chi, \\"If the opponent does not move, then I do not move. At the opponent's slightest move, I move first.\\" - Wu Yu-hsiang [149]<br /><br />We occasionally enter moments of incredible presence when we are very focused and aware. 'Masters of living' maximize their creative potential by cultivating constant presence at every moment in life. This cultivates extra presence in sudden stressful situations. [172] Constant awareness also allows us to see beauty in mundane things that we usually ignore. [197]<br /><br />The greatest competitors know how to recover effectively between periods of stress. For instance, Michael Jordan completely ignores his basketball match during a two-minute break on the bench. [179]<br /><br />Entering a 'Zone' gives you higher performance, so we can 'Build Our Trigger' to the Zone. Waitzkin helped this guy Dennis create one: Dennis recognized that playing catch with his son made him feel relaxed and present in the moment, so Waitzkin built a routine around that, using activities that Dennis was already used to. Before playing catch, Dennis would eat a certain light snack for 10 mins, meditate for 15 mins, do stretching for 10 mins and listen to 10 mins of Bob Dylan. After a month of this routine, he did this routine before important meetings and became much more serene and productive during work. Waitzkin the slowly guided him in shortening his routine ('Making Smaller Circles'), eventually removing the snack and condensing the rest to 12 mins, yet retaining its effect. The routine, constructed to Dennis's tastes, became physiologically connected to a serene state of mind which can now be triggered. [188]<br /><br />Bring all the above skills together! [howto: 225]<br /><br />Creativity is relative to a certain foundation of knowledge. Moments of divine inspiration give us glimpses of something miraculous, and most are contented to hope for more of such inspiring moments. Waitzkin contends that we must investigate and find out `what makes the magic tick'. This raises our foundation to a whole new level, where what seemed like divine insight previously are common sense to us now. The cycle then continues with even greater inspirations and the struggle to make sense of them. [231]<br /><br />AFTERTHOUGHTS<br /><br />I didn't know Tai Chi could become so violent! Waitzkin once faced an opponent who was so good at reading his intention that seemed to read his mind. Waitzkin countered by rehearsing fake moves in his head so his opponent would gaurd against something nonexistant, while opening a loophole for Waitzkin to take advantage of.<br /><br />I must quote Waitzkin's romantic description of his first encounter with chess:<br /><br />\\"I was six years old, a rough-and-tumble kid... driving my parents crazy with mischief. 'Too much boy,' my mom says... I loved to swing on the monkey bars and become Tarzan, the world my jungle. But now something seemed different. I looked over my shoulder, and was transfixed by mysterious figurines set up on a marble chessboard. I remember feeling I was looking into a forest. The pieces were animals, filled with strange potential, as if something dangerous and magical were about the leap from the board... then the pieces exploded into action, nimble fingers [of old men playing in the park]... I was pulled into the battlefield, enraptured; something felt familiar about this game, it made sense... it was a strange feeling of discovering a lost memory.\\" [3]<br /><br />This raises two points:<br /><br />I. Talent really exists.<br />II. In contrast to the usual encouragement to \\"quiet our mind\\" and \\"be in the present moment\\" when appreciating fine art, the beauty of Chess (and other games of strategy) is not in any \\"present state\\", but the *potential* of the complex magic that can erupt from the quiet and deceptively docile battlefield.
079073639X|4.0|Norman (Dustin Hoffman) is a psychologist, Beth (Sharon Stone) is a biologist, and Harry (Samuel L. Jackson) is a mathematician. They are part of a team created in response to a report Norman made years ago concerning how to cope with first contact. Yes, first contact with aliens. Norman had not anticipated, however, that the contact would be on the ocean floor in a craft that has been down there for over 300 years. They are called in under a top secret clearance to investigate.<br /><br />The sphere in the title is a golden orb that floats in the air of the alien vessel, with ripples on its surface and no visible opening. Still, Harry manages to get inside it, and is clearly changed by the experience. Then just about everything aboard the undersea habitat in which they have their headquarters starts to go wrong. Very, very wrong.<br /><br />I don't want to tell too much. The plot twists are really unexpected, so I don't want to spoil the fun. Go ahead and try to figure out what is going on: you'll probably be wrong.
0345803485|1.0|The following review contains mild spoilers.<br /><br />I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. See, I should know better, because that's what brought me to read \\"Twilight.\\" That, too, was endlessly disappointing. Let me start off by saying that there is no plot here. Well...okay. There was plot for about two pages, and only to provide Edward and Bella -- OOPS, I MEAN CHRISTIAN AND ANA -- with cause to wail and gnash their teeth about WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE if ANYTHING BAD HAD HAPPENED to the other. On and on, ad nauseum. Seriously, any potential plot points are quashed as quickly as possibly so as not to disturb the characters' every-two-pages sex.<br /><br />But, see, here's the thing -- I could have forgiven the lack of plot IF there had been scorching, kinky sex to make up for it. BUT THERE WASN'T. There's sex -- oh yes, there's sex. And 90 percent of it is not just vanilla, but BORING, REPETITIVE vanilla sex. If you're looking for naughty, kinky sex here? Abandon that hope right now, buddy. Not only is the sex not kinky, but the book tells us that Christian is only interested in that icky kinky stuff because childhood trauma made him crazycakes. Oh, and the couple's ONE foray into something a teensy bit kinky is so horrifying for Ana that she not only safewords (*brief pause for eye-rolling*), but immediately breaks up with Christian (which, again, is used as a pseudo-plot point that gives them an excuse to angst for two pages).<br /><br />I guess it's back to fanfiction for me.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I like this movie, but I have just one burning question: are there really bears in the Indian jungle? It would seem they belong to colder climates. Oh, well, nobody asked for 100% authenticity. And how did the man cub learn to speak English? No more absurd than the rest of the animals in the jungle speaking English, I suppose.<br /><br />Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is an adorable young man, maybe 11 years old and rail thin, when the wolf pack that raised him from a baby \\"man cub\\" decides he has to be taken to the man village because Shere Khan the Tiger (George Sanders) is around, and he hates humans. He would surely destroy the man cub and anyone who tried to protect him. So Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot) volunteers to take him to the man village.<br /><br />Mowgli doesn't want to go, he wants to stay in the jungle, even after Kaa the Snake (Sterling Holloway) hypnotizes him and the monkeys kidnap him. It turns out King Louie of the Apes (Louis Prima) wants Mowgli to teach him how to be a human. Specifically, he wants fire, but Mowgli doesn't know how to make fire, so that doesn't work out so well.<br /><br />There is also a brigade of elephants led by Col Hathi, who will tell anyone at the drop of a branch about how he won the Victoria Cross. The colonial's adorable little son makes friends with Mowgli, which turns out to be important later on.<br /><br />It's a fun story, but I won't swear it bears much resemblance to the original Jungle Book. Still, this is a good one to share with children and grandchildren.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I read her debut novel, Sister, and absolutely loved that. Lupton's second novel is just as good, and I have found a new author I love.  I thought, once again, her plot was very clever and the way she pulled it off, brilliant.  The plot was not only realistic, as far as the medical outcome, but written so well.  As a reader, I \\"bought into\\" the unusual format immediately and right up to the end, it did not disappoint.  Well done!  And I highly recommend this one.
B00024I2Z4|4.0|This one is better than I expected. Since Disney is traditionally very big on old-fashioned girly girls, I was not at all certain how this story of a girl who dresses up in armor and passes herself off as a boy in order to join the Chinese army and fight the invading Huns would work out. Turns out it's really pretty good. The premise is that she donned her father's armor to save him from conscription since he was wounded in the service of the Emperor years before. It was clear he was unfit for duty, but the conscription officers demanded one man from every family, and Mulan had no brothers.<br /><br />She has two magical allies: a dragon (Eddie Murphy at his best) who was sent by her ancestors to protect and aid her, and a cricket given to her by her grandmother for good luck. Grandmother didn't know about the idea of going to war, of course; she had brought the cricket for good luck when Mulan was presented to the matchmaker. That didn't go well at all. But the cricket turns out to be pretty darn lucky anyway.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie is the training camp, where the captain who is ruggedly handsome and the General's son is set the nearly impossible task of training the sorriest bunch of recruits you've ever seen. Mulan (called Ping as a boy) ends up being one of the best recruits, with courage, agility and cleverness more than making up for lack of bulk. Still, the company is really not ready when they are tricked into believing the general has called them to the front.<br /><br />No, I won't give any more away, except to say that there is a good bit of humor, lots of creativity and surprises, and the predictable part that Mulan becomes a hero and wins the romantic attention of the handsome captain.<br /><br />The dragon is a little guy, but arguably the best character in the whole movie.
0060873086|5.0|This was a very intriguing book. Memories of the movie \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\" played through my mind at various points, but it certainly had its own intrigue and realism. I'm not scientifically savvy, so couldn't say offhand how realistic the story was, but it was entertaining. I looked forward to listening to the story every time I got into the car. I was a bit shocked in various instances, but as characters fell to the hostility of nature, it truly supported the concept that nature plays no favorites. A great story that I highly recommend.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) has a clone, who is now a young man with amazing ambitions. The story of how the clone was created is much too much to reveal here. In fact, an awful lot is too much to reveal here. This is a very tightly interwoven plot.<br /><br />This is a story of The Next Generation crew, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Dianna's (Marina Sirtis) wedding as the introduction. We also have Geordi (LaVar Burton) and Worf (Michael Dorn), and of course Data (Brent Spiner). I'm not clear on the time line, because Geordi is no longer wearing his visor, but Data seems unaware of the fact that his creator (Dr. Soon?) made other androids. I'm not that sort of Trekkie.<br /><br />It's a real action picture, but there are some intense thoughtful moments as well. In fact, I'd say the balance between characters and hardware is just about perfect.<br /><br />Sorry I can't tell you more, but I certainly don't want to ruin a five-star movie.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|If you have fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's 1981 version, you owe it to yourself to see what 30 years of technological advances have done for adventure movies involving fantastic monsters. They're fantastic!<br /><br />No doubt you know the story by now, although this version has some interesting twists. Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a demi-god: Zeus (Liam Neeson) was his father by a human mother. A queen, in fact. Zeus disguised himself as her husband and . . . Well, anyway, Perseus was raised by a fisherman and his family who were killed when some uppity soldiers tore down a statue of Zeus.<br /><br />Hades (Ralph Fiennes, who also played Lord Voldemort) gets angry at how uppity the humans are getting, and tells his brother Zeus he will teach them humility. He points out that while Zeus feeds on the humans' prayers and love, Hades lives on their fear.<br /><br />Anyway, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken, a huge horrible monster, who can only be placated by the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), while Perseus has concluded that it is his destiny to slay the Kraken. But first he needs to defeat Medusa (Natalia Vodianova).<br /><br />He's not entirely alone, but the soldiers he took with him all seem to be pretty expendable. He has a guardian goddess, Io (Gemma Arterton), and a magical sword from Zeus that he refuses to use until the last minute, and the invaluable aid of Pegasus. Oddly, in this version Pegasus is the only black winged horse in the herd; I'm used to his being white.<br /><br />It's rousing thrill-a-minute adventure, not too gory for the older kids, and refreshingly realistic compared to the stop-action techniques of Harryhausen. There are several extra characters, one whole group of which I won't tell you about because their appearance on the scene is a surprise, as is their role in the story. If you love mythology, you'll love this movie.
1619690039|4.0|I really enjoyed listening to this book. Puller's family and past are slowly drawn out, but never fully developed, leaving enough mystery to make you wonder. However, Baldacci successfully creates a character that you root for and hope will finally find that woman, Sam, to complete him. The problems I discovered were with the simplicity of every character beyond the protagonists and the less fulfilling aspect of the book's ending. Overall, this was quite the entertaining book and one I'd recommend.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a federal marshal who is sent to the hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. It is 1954, and mental health treatment is still pretty primitive. But he and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), soon begin to suspect that the hospital is using the patients for horrible experiments. Then Teddy starts having some really horrible dreams.<br /><br />The audience does not really know what is true, what is imagined, what is Teddy's nightmare, or what is what. This would be decidedly unfair if we did not get to the bottom of it, and discover the truth, before the end of the film. But we do. And frankly, I for one did not see it coming. Which is a high compliment for a mystery story.<br /><br />It's quite an adventure, pretty bloody at times, and DiCaprio has almost no sex appeal in this one. Almost.

B00000K0DQ|3.0|I generally like movies based on true stories, and this one is well told. But the story is so incredibly depressing that I simply cannot give it more than three stars. If anyone can see this film and continue to support the death penalty, I don't want to know about it.<br /><br />Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarondon) got a letter from a prisoner on death row, Matthew Porcelet (Sean Penn). She answered, and he asked her to come visit him. His family never came to visit him. So she did. He asked her to try to get him a lawyer, so she did.<br /><br />Understand, this was not an innocence project. He and another man raped and murdered a young woman and murdered her boyfriend, leaving their bodies in the woods to be found a week later. But the older man got a life sentence, while Matthew got a death sentence. It was honestly speculated that the older man had more money, or his family did, and could hire a better lawyer. As Matthew himself pointed out, there are no rich men on death row.<br /><br />So Sister Helen embarks on a project to try to get him an appeal, a pardon from the governor, something. She goes to visit his family and those of both the victims. All I have to say on the matter is make sure you have a full box of tissues before you start this one.<br /><br />One reason I got depressed with this movie is that Helen is, after all, a nun. After Matthew asks her to formally be assigned as his spiritual advisor, the chaplain (a stuffed shirt) advises her that it is her responsibility to try to get him to confess his sins and seek forgiveness. So some of the most emotional scenes are about religion.<br /><br />I used to be a supporter of the death penalty myself, but I have changed my mind. I used to feel the death penalty was actually less cruel than keeping a person locked up in prison literally all his life. Now my idea is we should give the worst criminals life without possibility of parole and an option for suicide. If in fact death is less cruel, then let them choose that for themselves. Give them a capsule and let them decide when and whether to take it.em choose that for themselves. Give them a capsule and let them decide when and whether to take it.

B000AYEL6U|4.0|No, this is not about the United States vs. the Confederate States. This is the north and the south of England. Specifically, Margaret Hale, a vicar's daughter from the south, moves north with her parents when her father resigns his position over a matter of conscience. They move to Milltown, which is to say a cotton mill town, where lint from the cotton fills the air and the place is decidedly dreary. There her father takes up teaching.<br /><br />John Thornton, tall, dark and handsome, owns and operates one of the mills. But he and Margaret get off on the wrong foot when she witnesses him beating up on a man who lit a pipe in the mill. Clearly, smoking is extraordinarily dangerous in a cotton mill, with all that lint in the air, but Margaret sees him as having an unreasonable temper.<br /><br />Life in the north is drastically different from what Margaret knew in the south. But she never really liked London, and is open to learning to love the people she finds in Milltown. Specifically, her tender heart is touched by the plight of the workers, and becomes involved in their attempts to form a union.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the story is that Thornton is as pressured to conform by the other owners as the workers are by the union workers. Both sides insist that they must \\"stick together.\\" Thornton is more enlightened than the other owners, but that's not saying much. He tries to get them interested in the idea that caring for the well-being of his workers is good business, as they work better and last longer. But there is also pressure from suppliers of cotton (America, Egypt, I don't remember it all) and from buyers.<br /><br />This a four-part BBC miniseries, totaling about four hours, so there's lots of time to develop detailed sub-plots. Most of them add up to repeated misunderstandings between Margaret and Thornton. Of course they fall in love, and of course they both deny it.<br /><br />There are also a lot of deaths in this story. Don't get too attached to any of the characters except Margaret Hale and John Thornton; they're dropping like flies!ached to any of the characters except Margaret Hale and John Thornton; they're dropping like flies!

B003Y5H53S|5.0|What superb imagination! What creative animation techniques! What a marvelous sheriff is Rango (Johnny Depp)!<br /><br />Rango was a lizard in a terrarium with a broken Barbie doll, a wind-up fish and a plastic palm tree. And a wild imagination, where he is a movie director/producer who is making all sorts of creative movies in his own mind. But when his terrarium suffers an accident (what an accident!) on a lonely stretch of road in the Mohave Desert, he takes the advice of a mystical armadillo and walks off into the desert looking for Dirt. Turns out it's a town.<br /><br />The town of Dirt is populated by small animals, and its entire economy is based on water. Literally: the bank holds a large bottle like those that go into water coolers, and when Rango shows up, there's only about a week's worth of water left. Why? Where did it go? Why did the pretty young lady named Beans see water being dumped in the desert? Who is controlling the water supply?<br /><br />No, I'm not going to tell you and spoil all the fun. Watch it at least twice to catch all the more subtle jokes, like the music when an air force of bats races through a canyon shooting everything up. OK, there may be some minor inconsistencies, like when most everything is made from something on a human scale, but the firearms are scaled to the small animals who wield them.<br /><br />A very, very fun movie.

He and his cat are fishing while his goldfish looks on placidly in her fish bowl.<br /><br />This is yet another Disney classic that is worth sharing with your children and/or grandchildren, but you may have to explain some of the more arcane aspects. 1940 was a long, long time ago.
076115678X|5.0|This book is a must have for people who are new to the curly world, and people who are thinking about going natural. If you are going naturally curly, or thinking about it then this book is for you. I am a black female who has been natural for a year and I just enjoyed reading the book. I like the regimen Loraine has for all curl types. Please believe me in saying that her regimen cannot go wrong with your hair, no matter the curl type. It is successful in replenishing moisture into your hair. I am not a wash n go girl, because it takes forever for my hair to dry, so I stick with twists and twist-outs. I wear a wash n go sometimes, but I like twists. I also use this technique on my daughter's hair. It saves us lots of money on expensive products. I mainly use Tresseme Naturals for my conditioner that I leave in, and co-wash with VO5. I did purchase the DevaCurl No-poo, but I haven't got around to using it just yet. The money for that doesn't bother me too much, because I will only be washing once a month. Overall, this book is a must have and share!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|OK, it's a good movie. Maybe not quite as fabulously great as the hype about it, but it's good.<br /><br />Jamal is a Mumbai street kid along with his brother Salim. Although Salim is reluctant, they rescue a little girl named Latika. The ways in which they get used, abused and exploited are depressing, but they are smart, resourceful and courageous. They get separated, for which Jamal blames Salim (justifiably), and Latika is taken over by a brutal SOB who just happens to be Salim's employer.<br /><br />But Jamal never gave up on finding her. In fact, he says at one point that he went on the TV show \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" mostly because he figured she would be watching. He knows the answers to the questions, much to everyone's surprise because he is supposedly uneducated and ignorant. But he has a superb memory, and in a series of flashbacks, he explains to a policeman who is trying to charge him with cheating how he knew the answer to each question. Does he know the answer to the last one, for a prize of 20 million rupees? Is Latika watching? Will they get back together at last?<br /><br />It is written.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|The best of the recent (OK, relatively recent) Disney animated fairy tales. We have returned to the fully shaded, detailed art work, and only the insufferable Gaston is angular in style. This is full of the little touches that make Disney stories so fine for both children and adults, like jokes that mean one thing to the kid and quite another to the adult. Cute characters like Chip (a chipped tea cup) who are also clever and resourceful, and an enchanted prince who, when finally the spell is broken, is truly handsome.<br /><br />Belle is bored with her Provencal little town where nothing changes, reads books of romantic fantasies, and longs for more than \\"this provincial life.\\" But she loves her father, an eccentric inventor who is generally thought crazy, but who actually makes things that work. While he goes off to the science fair to exhibit his latest device, Belle is pestered by the most egotistical, arrogant, idiotic muscle-head in the village: Gaston, who considers Belle the only girl in town who is worthy of his greatness. He refers to her as lucky that he has decided to make her his wife. Belle strongly disagrees.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Papa is set upon by wolves, his horse runs away in fear, and he seeks refuge in an isolated castle that just happens to be enchanted. The prince was turned into a beast because he was rude to a witch (let that be a warning to you all, fellahs), and his entire staff was turned into household objects. Not inanimate objects, mind you, but ones that retain their basic personalities while becoming wood and metal and porcelain. My favorite is Lumiere, the maitre d, a candelabra with a very smooth style and an illuminating personality.<br /><br />Belle comes looking for her father, and offers herself as a hostage in exchange for him. Lumiere, Cogsworth (a clock) and Mrs. Potts (the tea pot, of course) try to get Beast to control his temper and be nice to the girl, hoping that she will fall in love with him and break the spell. It has a time limit: a magic rose is wilting, and someone must love him before the last petal falls.<br /><br />Of course it all works, but exactly how it all comes about is marvelous. Look for some pretty biting social satire in the march of the villagers up to the Beast's castle to kill him. You may find yourself remembering a few lines from \\"Hotel California.\\" I did.<br /><br />Yes, of course share this with your kids and grandkids. It's a lovely story, and worth watching over and over to catch further nuances.s a time limit: a magic rose is wilting, and someone must love him before the last petal falls.<br /><br />Of course it all works, but exactly how it all comes about is marvelous.

B003UESJH4|5.0|A beautiful movie! I thought about 4 stars, but finally realized I couldn't find any excuse for giving it less than 5. Seems funny to have what is essentially a simple historical narrative be so moving, but it is.<br /><br />The Duke of York (Colin Firth) had a terrible stammer, but he had a loving and beautiful wife (Helena Carter) who managed to find him a forward-thinking and quite brilliant speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Doesn't sound like it could make all that much of a story, but it does. I think one of the big reasons is that the actors have been brilliantly chosen. For example, Derek Jacobi plays the archbishop, with just a whiff of our dear Brother Cadfael to him. The dying King George V is played by Michael Gambon, aka Albus Dumbledore. Even the darling Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret are quite competent little actresses.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just an anglophile at heart, but I can't help thinking the British make better movies than we do in Hollywood.
B0058YPLA2|1.0|I was rather excited about this, but it turned out to be one of the worst shows in recent years. The green screen effects are nauseating, and the plot is boring, generic, and full of plot holes. The characters are underdeveloped and one dimensional (except for the rare like two characters who aren't their storybook cookie cutter copies.)
B001HN694K|5.0|Not your childhood Alice by any means. Tim Burton directed it, Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and the voice of the hookah-smoking caterpillar is Alan Rickman (aka Professor Snape). A lovely young Mia Wasikowska plays Alice as a 19-year-old who has followed a rabbit in a waistcoat down a rabbit hole to escape a put-up job of an engagement party to a total twirp of a young lord.<br /><br />This one answers a question I had as a child: why did Alice's clothes shrink and grow when she did? In this one, they do not. When she's tiny, and hiding in a tea pot so that the knave of hearts won't find her, Hatter fashions a little dress for her from the shreds of the dress (or maybe chemise?) she was wearing as of the earlier shrinking. Then when she's in the Red Queen's garden and grows very large, she is hiding behind some trees because she \\"outgrew\\" her clothes.<br /><br />The story is that this is (or is not?) the same Alice who was in Underland when she was a child, and called it Wonderland. This time her mission is to take up the Vorpel sword and slay the Jabberwock.<br /><br />The funniest character in the story is the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who has an enormous head -- literally. Also an enormous ego. She has a sort of lisp, and sounds a lot like Madeline Kahn. In fact, I was surprised to find that the actress was one I had not heard of before; the sound of her voice was so familiar.<br /><br />Great fun, especially if you can put aside any expectation that it follows the original story.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|LOVE harry potty and i do love the way they did this movie! The whole series is one of the best book to movie sets I have seen, however of all the movies this movie was the only one that left out some things significant enough to really bother me! If you haven't read the books though I see no reason why you wont love this!
B000JBWWRY|2.0|Sorry, Peter, but I grew up.<br /><br />Actually, it's more than that. Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about \\"The Peter Pan Syndrome,\\" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.<br /><br />There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012.
0375826742|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I don't want to give away any spoilers but there are some parts of the story that are  a little dry but the second half of the book is fabulous!!!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I heard this title for years, but knew almost nothing about it. I'm glad I finally saw it.<br /><br />I didn't catch exactly when this story takes place, but I recall the date 2035 being mentioned, so it was at least that far in the future. Much of the world is in chaos, but England is under the iron control of a theocracy. An unlikely hero emerges who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a black cape, and all black clothes.<br /><br />He calls himself V (Hugo Weaving), and we know of him primarily through the eyes of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes involved with him in an unusual way.<br /><br />Everything about this story is unusual, although there are clearly elements reminiscent of other stories, both movies and books. The flavor of 1984 is in it, as well as The Count of Monte Christo, Phantom of the Opera, The Wall, and Zorro at least; you may well discover others. It was a graphic novel (i.e., comic book) before it became a movie.<br /><br />I can tell you almost nothing about it without spoiling some of the best surprises. I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more. If it helps to understand what I'm talking about, let me just say that you may want to play it often enough to grab some of the best quotes. Or perhaps I'll look for the graphic novel.<br /><br />A movie that will live forever as a cult classic.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this series personally i did not mid paying for the kindle edition it really is in the personal preferance wether you buy the paperback or the kindle i couldn't put it down and i could take it everywhere amazing trilogy. E L james left me wanting more :)
B001DSNEJM|4.0|Very strange indeed. I was reminded of a Johnny Depp movie, something about a mental hospital on an island, but I can't find it on IMDB. Maybe it wasn't Depp but some other hunk I love.<br /><br />Anyway, Ben (Paul Walker) had just been released from parole when his brother showed up with an idea for a robbery that went terribly wrong, and three people were killed, including his brother. Ben is sentenced to die by lethal injection. (This is Texas; they are really into capital punishment.)<br /><br />But after they shoot him full of drugs on a cruciform gurney, he wakes up elsewhere. On a road on the way to an out-of-the-way mental hospital run by a Catholic order, where he has been offered the job of groundskeeper.<br /><br />And then it REALLY gets weird. What's real and what is not? Ben doesn't know, and the audience certainly doesn't either. But in the end, Ben sorts it out and we do, too. It's a very dark and stormy movie (including literally, as the hospital is in the Willamette Valley in Oregon), but it has a happy ending.<br /><br />Paul Walker looks really familiar. *Back to the IDMB* Right. He's done a lot of TV, and several other movies, but nothing I remember. Was he the hunk in the Dove for Men commercial?
0345803485|1.0|I feel as though I'm a victim of a bad joke.  I've been duped.  How this book could possibly be perceived as erotic or even decent is beyond me.  I have one word for this book, garbage.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Disney's first feature-length animation, and a genuine classic. But you do have to remember that it's 1937 as you view this film. Also, it was adapted from a traditional story, one of the ones collected by the brothers Grimm. So try not to get hung up on the sexism involved. Believe me, they thought they were honoring women when they made them princesses who fell in love at a glance with a handsome prince. Who has but one wish: for her prince to find her and carry her away to his castle.<br /><br />Oh, yes; and for Grumpy to like her. She gets both wishes, of course.<br /><br />It seems I had not remembered much about the story, and probably saw only edited versions on television all those years ago. Some silly things struck me, like the fact that the dwarfs mine fully cut gems, not natural crystals. Presumably Disney felt his young audience would not know them for gems if they were uncut. And there is the really hilarious scene where Snow White tells the dwarfs they must wash up before dinner. I remember some parts, but it was a disconnected, chaotic scene to my childish mind. Same with the woodland animals who helped Snow White clean up the cottage.<br /><br />It's a pretty movie, and part of our cultural heritage. If you have kids and/or grandkids, you really should consider buying it. And no matter who you are, I think you'll notice things you missed. I certainly did.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|just got this game and I really am enjoying it. so far its the best part of my day so far.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|A tender little story with a deceptively simply premise. Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) leaves her lake house in 2006, and leaves a note for the next tenant. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) finds the note when he moves in in 2004. Oooops! We never get a good explanation about how they got a bit turned around in time, but it seems they can correspond using the mailbox at the lake house. It doesn't take long to realize that they have the same dog -- a female named Jack -- and that Jack is living in her own time. She seems perfectly capable of accepting and living in the anomalous situation.<br /><br />After they've exchanged correspondence for awhile, they try to work out a way to meet in person. But it's not as easy as it sounds. Do they eventually make it? How?<br /><br />Ain't gonna tell you. It's sweet. Really.

B004G600A4|4.0|OK, it's pretty funny, and Rapunzel's hair is not only beautiful, it is magical. For one thing, it never did get tangled, for all the title suggests. As someone whose hair was nowhere near that long when a week's worth of bed head was bad enough to cut it off, I find it very hard to believe that she was able to keep it so smooth and clean and healthy. Imagine what it must have been like to wash!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does not explore these practical matters. What's more, her hair often seems to change in length, which is an inconsistency not common in Disney films. Still, the girl is undeniably pretty, even if she sounds far more 21st century than back in the \\"once upon a time\\" days. This is not particularly unusual for Disney princesses, however.<br /><br />Just in case anyone has missed the basic premise, a princess was born with long, magical golden hair. It could cure anything, including injuries and old age. She was therefore kidnapped by an old witch who kept her locked in a tower, claiming to be her mother who was protecting her from the mean old world outside, and using Rapunzel's hair to keep herself young.<br /><br />Rapunzel remembers nothing of her former life consciously, but some of it comes out in her painting, which she does all around the walls and ceiling of her tower chamber. But all she knows of the world outside is what she can see from her window. And one thing she can see is that on her birthday every year, thousands of glowing lights appear in the distance, all different colors and floating on the wind. Her mother says they are stars, bur Rapunzel is smart enough to know that they don't act like the stars do. She does not know it, but her royal parents have made a tradition of setting lamps like tiny hot air balloons adrift on her birthday, in her memory and in the hope that she may see them and know that they are calling to her.<br /><br />Of course there must be a handsome rescuer, but this time it is a thief who has just broken into the palace and stolen the crown which sat on an altar waiting for the return of the golden-haired princess. I doubt that he knows that story, or he would probably have known who Rapunzel was when he met her.<br /><br />In any case, the story is the traditional one with lots of amusing additions, including a little chameleon who is Rapunzel's pet. It's pretty and it's fun, but it's Disney, which means it's a pretty high sugar content for me.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|omg! so addictive! it was so amazing!  almost to twemty words! i mean wow! it is like soooo amazing! done.
B00005JLSE|4.0|The music, the costumes, the dancing and singing, are all top rate. Who cares if the plot is downright stupid? I'd give it five stars if it was just a little more clearly understood to be humor, but murder is such an un-funny thing.<br /><br />Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a girl in the chorus who had an affair with a furniture dealer because he claimed he could get her a job in a swank nightclub. When she discovered he was lying and he laughed at her, she shot him, then tried to get her auto mechanic husband to take the blame.<br /><br />They met in prison where the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) is doing quite a business in selling favors of various kinds, and apparently collecting them, too. She recommends Roxie see defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has never lost a case. Turns out he's Velma's attorney, too.<br /><br />That's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene. But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere. Might make you think of Jailhouse Rock or Cry Baby. Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly. All in all, it's a lot of fun, and makes me think again about the fashion dolls Robert Tonner made from the main characters. If I had the money . . . but of course I do not.

B0007939NO|4.0|Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) and Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) are vacationing in the Scottish highlands when they happen upon the enchanted village of Brigadoon. This is a musical, of course, so there is lots of song and dance. And of course Tommy falls in love with Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse), and she with him. Problem is, Brigadoon only appears one day in each one hundred years. If he stays with Fiona, Tommy will disappear altogether as far as the world outside is concerned. This includes his wealthy, beautiful and very spoiled fiance back in New York. He is told that no one who \\"belongs to Brigadoon\\" may leave without causing it to disappear entirely, but there is one in town, Harry Beaton, who is determined to leave because Fiona's sister married someone else.<br /><br />If you love watching two excellent dancers, Kelly and Charisse, doing lovely, romantic dances together, and you like highland men dancing in their kilts, you'll enjoy this movie. Sure, it's corny; love stories usually are, and musicals even more so.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|Set in New Orleans during the Jazz Age (presumably the 1920s), this is one fun story. Tiana is a little girl when it starts, her mama is the best dressmaker in town, and Charlotte LaBouff is the spoiled daughter of \\"Big Daddy\\" LaBouff, who has been the king of the Mardi Gras Parade for five years running by the time the girls are grown up.<br /><br />Charlotte means to marry a prince, while Tiana dreams of opening her own restaurant, which was a dream she inherited from her daddy, who died in the war. She's been working hard and saving money to buy a place for the restaurant when Prince Naveen comes to town. Of course, Charlotte's father invites him to stay with them, and Charlotte is determined to rope him into marrying her.<br /><br />But there's trouble in the form of Dr. Facilier, a wicked Voodoo man, who turned the prince into a frog. Tiana is wearing a princess tiara Charlotte loaned to her with a gorgeous gown for the Mardi Gras ball. So the prince figures she is a princess, and talks her into kissing him. Unfortunately, he turns her into a frog instead.<br /><br />How they turn back into humans is the rest of the story. It's got plenty of great music, lots of colorful magic effects, and amusing characters that reminded me a good bit of \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"
B0002KVULG|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS MOVIE.  NOT A CRITICAL SUCCESS WHEN IT OPENED, BUT WHAT DO THE CRITICS KNOW.  I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF BEST, IF NOT THE BEST, DRACULA MOVIES EVER MADE.  THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE LOVE SCENE WITH THE LASER BEAMS, OR WHATEVER THEY USED. TAKES AWAY FROM THE GOTHIC FEEL OF THE MOVIE.  OTHER THAN THAT, PERFECT.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Think you remember it? I challenge you to see how much you missed when you were a kid.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw this, in a theater. Most Disney memories of mine are in black and white because they were on a TV, but this one was on a big screen theater in Philadelphia. I was probably four years old, and going all the way to Philadelphia (maybe an hour away) just to see a movie was a very big deal. I remember my mother had to take me out during the fight of the tyrannosaurus and the stegosaurus, because I started screaming and crying. So it's not surprising that I didn't remember the end of that segment.<br /><br />Seeing this as an adult is very, very different. I notice things it would not have occurred to me to notice as a child, like abstract parts. Remember when the narrator introduced the sound track? When he does the low notes on the bassoon (he had to be coaxed a bit), the lines not only wiggled like a tongue giving a raspberry, but had little wiggle marks like parenthesis, or maybe like saliva drops off a wet raspberry.<br /><br />It's hard to remember that this entire movie was made the old-fashioned way, with acetate cells, painted one by one. Lucky collectors have carried off those painted cells and framed them as art, because they are. If I had the money to collect them, this is the movie I would most want to collect. The dancing mushrooms, certainly, and the frolicking baby unicorns, and the fairies that spangle the garden with dew. There's so very much here to love.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so fun and entertaining for a long time. I need more of these games in my life because this game keeps you going.
B00007KQA3|3.0|Of course it's depressing. It's supposed to be depressing. Still, it is a well-crafted production of a very dark story.<br /><br />John Hurt plays Winston Smith, an outer party hack whose job it is to \\"correct\\" history. When something happens today that is contradictory to what happened in the past, the records from the past must all be edited. That's Winston's job, along with a room full of other outer party hacks.<br /><br />We learn a little bit about the way IngSoc (English Socialism) works, but not much. A lot of the talk is in Newspeak, and you can follow it a great deal better in the book than you can in a movie. Still, it is clear that Big Brother is the figurehead leader, and reality is manipulated any way the party wants to.<br /><br />Suzanna Hamilton plays Julia, a 25-year-old outer party functionary who is active in the anti-sex league but loves sex privately. Needless to say, she has to seduce the rabbit-scared Smith. We get a few nude scenes, where she is lean but attractive, and he is a stringy scarecrow. They rent a room above a curio shop where they can be alone. Even if you've never read the book or seen the earlier movie, you can guess how that works out.<br /><br />The real casting triumph is Richard Burton as O'Brien, the inner party functionary who suckers Smith and Julia into betraying themselves. He's the one who delivers the famous line: \\"If you would like to know the future, Winston, think of a boot crushing the face of a man forever.\\"<br /><br />If you appreciate dystopian stories, you'll probably appreciate this one. It is, after all, George Orwell's classic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm appalled that this is the #1 bought book on Amazon.  I downloaded the sample and read it thinking it was a decent book, only to buy it and have it turn in to a trashy novel that soaked me for $9.99.  If the sample is supposed to give you an idea of what is in the book, that sample doesn't.  So BEWARE!!! If you want a detailed description of a deranged person's idea of sex that is what you'll get with this book.  I wouldn't buy another thing written by this author, it is too bad the author is laughing all the way to the bank.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss is a ginger tabby, just like my beloved Adler, but that's not why I love this film. He's voiced by Antonio Banderas, who is incredibly sexy, but that's not why, either. His friends Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty are hilarious, as are Jack and Jill, the goose that lays golden eggs (actually a cute little gosling), and really all the characters and situations. But the most important reason is the incredibly multi-layered sense of humor this film displays. Inside jokes for cat lovers, double entendres galore, visual humor that makes you want to watch it a second time just to appreciate all the subtleties, and terrific animation.<br /><br />Dreamworks shows us how animation should be done. I swear I love them even more than I did Disney when I was a child. Be prepared to ROFLYAO.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Yes i know the original songs were removed.but that's the only thing wrong.other than that its a amazing set.great boxset.discs come on top of eachother but no scratches.i got this as a first time fan.buy this.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I think today, or possibly even tomorrow, is the official release date for the DVD. But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.<br /><br />It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard,\\" and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the \\"Elder Wand,\\" which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.<br /><br />Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out. I get the distinct impression the first half hour or so has most of the differences.
0307951529|5.0|Definitely recommend for those who don't want to get lost in the world of 100 page business plans and venture capital, or who want \\"how does your inner child feel about all of this\\" junk.  Also, if you are in one of the cities on his book tour, GO!  It was very motivating and entertaining at the same time.
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|I am a die hard fan of the Underworld series.  But this one felt like a made or television or straight to DVD exercise.  Absolutely no character development.  All the effects have been utilize before.  The giant werewolf was a cheesy as a bad Hulk. The movie clocked in under 90 minutes.  why did you guys ruin the series with this mess?  Even the one without Kate was superior to this hastily made running through the motions film.  The film clocked in at under 90 minutes and the editing was excessively choppy leaving one with the feeling that a reel or two had been left on the cutting room floor.  The cheap voiceover at the beginning actually summed up what might have been an excellent movie (i.e. vampires and werewolves had been discovered by humans as being real and then were summarily \\"cleansed\\" from the face of the planet. Oh think what political themes and Nazi/republican slants could have been realized).  But NOOOO!  Instead, we are presented with a Saturday morning movie with action sans substance.  And the action was completely predictable and redundant.  They blew it and this will likely be the end of big budget Underworld films.  Next will be the Hellraiser type derivatives you find at Blockbuster in the \\"new release\\" section!
0316077046|2.0|Boring and repetitive. The authors pad their paper-thin plot with too much fluff. The problem with most of these trilogies is that they're really one book spread out unnecessarily to make more money. I liked the first book, \\"Beautiful Creatures,\\" but could barely finish this one. The characters are annoying and two-dimensional and I didn't care what happened to them. I think I'll stay away from the last book altogether.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book takes you deep into the most wicked kind of evil that can be perpetratrated on another human. It is a true testament of what humans can and will do to survive as well as a lesson on how we can and do grow once one breaks free from the bonds of evil.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is soooo great! Its challenging, fun, and free!  Tip: Save ur power ups until wave 35+ because they are difficult to obtain unless u buy them with real money.

0691152640|4.0|The historical perspective on government debt defaults is invaluable to those in finance and investing.  This should be required material in business education (at least the data).  Modern Finance is built on the notion that government debt is risk-free (at least the US's), which is rubbish.  Love the historical perspective and insightful charts that neatly summarize their findings, but I found the book repetitive, verbose and a bit \\"academic\\" (in the sense of naive).  The authors point out the meaningful data limitations, such as those on domestic debt default, but then seem to ignore them in their statistical analysis (such as whether there's more tendency to default on ext vs dom debt).  I also quibble with some of the details of their analysis such as grouping serial defaults (those within 2 years of each other) into one.  It is important for a stakeholder to have some sense of the likelihood of further defaults in the short-term given one has occurred. That said, I found this book to have been well worth the read.<br /><br />One glaring omission is \\"off-balance\\" sheet financing such as leasing, entitlements, and long-term purchasing commitments.  Inclusion of debt-like obligations would change the financial picture dramatically and enable better comparisons across time and countries.  After all, some countries are more reliant on off-balance sheet financing than others.

1469984202|5.0|When I bought this book, I bought it because of the reviews, as well as the idea that it was one of an already published complete series. I am so SAD that the rest of the series isn't written yet! The review that turned me from a lookie-loo into a reader was one that mentioned that it's an independent book, free of the annoyances common in independent books. I didn't even know there was an independent book division, and that this independent division had annoyances!<br />I was intrigued.<br /><br />I purchased the book for my kindle.<br /><br />I read it in three days. And that's funny to me, because I was really trying to pace myself... no late nights, I said when I started. No reading while my kids were up and need my attention. Oh no. I read it through and through almost in one swipe. I literally could not put it down! I cannot believe this is an author who hasn't been plucked out of the mass of marketable artists by some big publishing company. It's brilliant.<br /><br />It was written in a way that plays on our unconscious fears of technology and social norms as we humans spiral towards our future, using the the lubrication of technology to radically propel us violently towards social change. What then? We can't be less resilient than the cockroach, the majority-agreed living being on this planet voted most likely to succeed. Howey must agree because his fast-forward humanity takes place in a time still reactionary to events that changed the face of the planet, even though those in that time don't realize it.<br /><br />It's wonderful because it starts out with describing 'the way things are'. Then it goes to conflicts that happen because of the way things are. Then there are slow reveals to WHY things are they way things are. Then it moves to climactic finale in the idea of social revolution... thousands of years beyond our current day. I like this because the way he writes, he isn't inserting items and scenarios that are fantastical. More, he writes about things that are futuristic mutations of what we already know. This makes it chilling and personal.<br /><br />All throughout I ask myself, am I a person who made this world? Am I a person who could survive in it?<br /><br />I like that.ngs that are futuristic mutations of what we already know. This makes it chilling and personal.<br /><br />All throughout I ask myself, am I a person who made this world? Am I a person who could survive in it?<br /><br />I like that.

B007IE4DSG|5.0|In just one word FANTASTIC!! Wow,these songs have never sounded better! I really loved all of George Harrisons music in its original release format. However, these stripped down, raw, heartfelt versions are priceless!! With only 10 songs this just wets our taste buds for more.  We can only  hope they release more of these \\"treasures\\" from all of George's catalogue. It would be a real treat for Harrison fans if Olivia releases 10 demos from each of his albums. Since George is no longer with us this is as close as we can get to new music.  If you love George Harrison music please BUY THIS NOW!!!  You will love this cd!!
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|I have seen some things in my life .....the fall of saddam hussein the cloning of a sheep  but let me just say all of those things throughout history have failed in comparison to this movie.Its mindblowing to call it a modern day masterpiece is an UNDERSTATEMENT it literally changed my life i saw this movie and it was like looking into the face of god i dont know how to explain it its like watching a child being born at every second it twist and turns just the like road that paul walker and vin diesel seem to race down i can honestly say that in this movie paul walker solidified himself as the greatest actor of all time  SPOILER  ALERT  the scene between him and vin diesel when theyre in the cars in the end of the movie  made me stand up and appluad in the theater .........i cried i laughed i was changed  thank you hollywood for this feat of perfection please make fifty more of these movies for me and my frat brothers.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones new cd is her best yet!!  She has changed her style once again and I feel her new sound is really wonderful. Norah's sexy, sultry, voice really  shines on several of these new songs. This is one of those cds where you can hit play and every song is a winner. I really love \\"Say Goodbye\\"  and \\"Happy Pills\\" but all the songs are  really great!  If you go to You Tube you can watch several of her new songs  performed live. Also check out the video for \\"Happy Pills\\".  Norah is the real deal, she can sing, she can write, plays great keyboards, a little guitar, and shes not too hard on the eyes!!  Hey Now!!!
1416549447|4.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things.  However, he seemed to repeat the information a lot (guess repetition is the key to memory).  It was to a point that annoyed me though, then again repetition annoys me period. lol.  Also, somethings kinda contradicted themselves, but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and I did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you.  Which will! give you more injuries later down the road.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great trilogy.  I read all the time and many of the books I read are of this nature.  I know some people are up in arms about the sex but really, it's no more than many other books out there.  Loved the characters and the story lines...although it is a love story, it's not your typical love story.  Pure fantasy and that's nice for a break from your every-day reality!!  Highly recommend reading all about Christian and Ana...you will fall in love with them!!

B000SEDDQ6|5.0|A series of unfortunate events is based on the cover, it is a series of unfortunate events. The three characters are Sunny, Vilot, and Klaus. From the first page of the book, the Baudelaire children are at the beach, when they recive terrible news. They end up at their far relatives manshion . He is really mean and gives the children hard chores, until one day, the uncle changes. That same day, they find out the uncles plan. In the story, everything is very unfortunate for the children. In the end, everything seems okay, but it's really not. You would never expect what happens.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for a friend and she recieved it before the expected date which is pretty cool. It was in excellent condition, I have no complaints. Will order from this seller again!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Ok. to start it is not a game to be played constantly. unless you want to spend a load of money. its great as ageneral time killer on breaks or randomly throughout the day. my complaints are alone the other lines in reviews. the glitches that freezes the kindle and requires a restart sets the timers rediculously high. ok what ever. with sick people that's great even more time to use tree chopping to get one of those 300 wood requiring mortors things. I mean seriously?! 300! and on top of that they need 8 medicines and then needles require not 1 but 2 of the things! if that's not bad enough once I hit level 30 every sick person required at least 2 of the buggers and I would have 3 to 5 sick people at a time. overall its an ok concept but some things are outlandish cost both real money and in game. its easier and cheaper to just let them keel over.
0307951529|4.0|Chris Guillebeau is notorious for many things: traveling, writing, helping people, and having awesome product launches.<br /><br />Add another to the list: great at inspiring people to action. This book lays down the basics of a new movement: the solo entrepreneur or microbusiness. The title says it all: you need very little money in order to get started.<br /><br />The first half of the book is more inspirational and does a good job of motivating those of us that might be afraid or hesitant to get started.<br /><br />Then the second half goes into more tactical, actionable advice.<br /><br />I am an Empire Building Kit customer and I loved this book. Great job Chris!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ok--I never get on here to write a review but I just had to comment on this book. Currently I am on page 176 of 514 and I do not think I can handle much more. I feel like i am reading a 13 year old girl's journal. The expressions are tacky and over used through out the entire book. I read the reviews prior to purchasing the book but i figured that if it was getting this much publicity it could not be that bad. Yes it can. It has just gotten media attention because of the raunchiness of the sex scenes. If you want the sexual thrill just rent a porn. You only have to deal with the cheesy bad acting/writing for a few minutes

Well done, Storey, and well done, Ms. Radcliffe! Now I must go off and knit an octagon.......

B005LAIH2W|3.0|John Carter A couple of years ago, Asylum put together &#34;A Princess of Mars&#34; in just a couple of weeks. It was one of the most bastardized movies I have ever seen. The only good thing in it was Tracy Lord's body, which is still nice after all these years.  Now, Disney has sunk a couple hundred million dollars in &#34;John Carter&#34; in another retelling of Edgar Rice Burroughs &#34;Martian&#34; books.  I will have to say that I went to see this film with reservations. I have seen several scenes on YouTube, and they didn't look to be anything like the books that I have grown to love over 45 years. I started reading them when I was around 12 years old, so I am pretty well acquainted with the characters.  That said, a friend and I went to the theater tonight and saw the film in a completely refurbished theater with new rocking chair seats. The cost of admission? $2.50.  As I expected, many aspects of the film did not go along with the books. Some things were a bit outrageous when compared to print, but the movie as a whole was OK. I think that if I had never read the books, I might have liked it more. On a scale of 1-100, I would still give it a 60. :p  The lead characters are Taylor Kitch as John Carter, and Lynn Collins as Dajah Thoris.  A few inconsistencies (not all listed) between the movie and the books are:  1 - Tars Tarkas was NOT the Jeddak when he found John Carter (The Jeddak was Tal Hajus).  2 - Woola could not run as fast as the movie makes out. He could apparently put a Greyhound to shame, but he couldn't run like a shot out of a cannon as he does in the movie.  3 - The Holy Therns could not just materialize anywhere on the planet, and they were not aliens. They also wore blonde wigs.  4 - The weapon that the Holy Therns used in the move came on quite a bit later in the series and was developed not by the Therns, but by a crazy Jeddak from another country who was out to conquer the world.  5 - Matai Shang was a &#34;Holy Thern&#34; and dedicated his dirty deeds to &#34;Lessor Therns&#34;. He would not have dirtied his hands with the things that the movie character did. He also had a beautiful daughter who was nowhere to be seen, and not even mentioned, in the movie.  6 - The movie intimated that the Therns were aliens to Mars. This was NOT the way it is told in the books. They fooled the planet into thinking they were &#34;Holy&#34; and doing the work if &#34;Issus&#34;. They were definitely not Holy, and Issus turned out to be a several hundred year old crazy woman who dined on the &#34;delicate&#34; parts of the most beautiful women on the planet that happened to be taken hostage by the Black Pirates of Barsoom (who themselves made raids on the Therns).  7 - Dajah Thoris was not a warrior, and neither was she a great scholar. She was a smart, pretty, and determined little princess who could wield a sword if she had too, and that was about it.  8 - John Carter could jump at most around 150 feet. Most of the time it was more like 10-50 feet. The movie has him jumping a thousand feet or more.  9 - Tardas Mors (her grand-father in the books) would never have made Dajah marry &#34;Sab Than&#34;, no matter what the cost to the city of Helium. There is no mention of Mors Kajak (her father in the books) at all.  10 - Powell and Carter were mining partners in the books.  11 - Sab Than was not a Jeddak and the city of Zodanga didn't move around on a giant machine. This was just stupid.  12 - If Kantos Kan had talked down to Dejah the way he did at the first of this movie, (Basically telling her to shut up) he would have gotten the hell beat out of him.  13 - The final insult was when Stanton changed the greeting &#34;Kaor&#34; to &#34;Gayor&#34; He totally gayed it up. If you have ever watched the movie, or if you have it, turn on your captions and see for yourself. It was disgusting.  Even with the inconsistencies, the movie was decent. I understand why it didn't do well in theaters. The early reviews were horribleand the previews really didn't let people know what the move was about. This is a shame too as there should be two more films to complete the original trilogy. But Stanton's incompetency has probably doomed any further movies in the series. Plus the fact that he took elements from eight of the first ten books and jumbled them together to make this mess. (Yes, ten books. John Carter of Mars and The Giant of Mars are printed together in one book because they are so short.)  But as stated: Andrew Stanton has screwed the characters up so much, and mixed up so many things from all the books, I don't see how it's possible to make another movie. This one man has doomed one of the greatest book series of all times to remain in just print, as I doubt any other studio would ever touch it now.  Note: Even if you do NOT like science fiction, or other movies of this type, take notice: If you like seeing good looking women in skimpy costumes, you should see this film. Lynn Collins is beautiful as Dajah Thoris, even though she is a bit old for the character.  The next time Disney decides to butcher a good book series, I hope they at least keep the gay guy in the closet.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and am certainly looking forward to the next one to see where the author takes Eva & Gideon's insanely scorching relationship. I have faith that as the writing evolves so will the characters depth. This book reminded me a lot of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy of course as I'm sure it did for any other reader who has read both, however I feel that the characters in this book are not as well rounded or complex as Ana & Christian in Fifty Shades. I also found myself wishing that the writing or choice of phrases in some instances weren't so jarring or explicit. I mean, don't get me wrong, I can certainly appreciate adult fantasy, I purchased, read , and really liked this book, I just mean that I found myself wishing for a bit less crassness in some instances. Felt that perhaps less might have been more sometimes. I think that was actually the one slight negative. I love having another intense seemingly dysfunctional couple to root for! I will definitely pickup the next one.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|I went into watching this with only having seen bits and pieces of the film from when I worked in a movie theater when it came out. That being said I really enjoyed it even after having read all of the one star reviews. It never seemed to me that it dragged on or slowed down at all, however that could just be because I haven't seen the theatrical edition. I thought it was full of funny jokes and it entertained me which in my opinion is what a film should do. If you enjoy action and comedy I'd recommend this to you, however if you have a stick up your a$$ steer clear of this one.

B006Z4LOPK|5.0|I was introduced to this series by a friend and I was stunned. I watch very little TV  but this is phenomenal. Gritty, a bit dark, occasionally campy, very sexy (yes, there's sex in it, well done from my perspective) with a bi-sexual succubus, a human sidekick, and a truly excellent supporting cast. I thoroughly enjoy them all and watching how the cast grows together, creating a connected and charismatic group. The succubus, Anna Silk (does anyone else see her distinct resemblance to Andrea Parker? I honestly thought they must be related) is an excellent choice and I really enjoy that she has a real body, curves and all. No stick legs or flat chest for her and I can only wish the US would follow suit. Go Canada!!!

B0050R0XEG|5.0|I've been a fan of LEGOs since I was a child having built sprawling space cities across the basement of my childhood home.  LEGOs have grown with me over the years into digital interfaces for computer robotics.  I owe a bit of this to my parents as they constantly supplied me with piles of new bricks and encouraged me to be creative.<br /><br />In respect to this I got this VW Van kit as a present for my father.  He has loved the classic VW Van for years and always pines about eventually owning one in his retirement as a classic car - and I'm helping him take that first step. ;)  This model is rather large, which is fantastic, as it lets the model have quite a bit of detail on the interior.  LEGO did an amazing job of representing everything that was in the original VW camper van in lego form.  With over 1300 pieces it will take some pleasurable time to build and comes out looking fantastic.<br /><br />Thank you LEGO for helping bring a huge smile to my Dad's face. :)

B005LAIHKY|5.0|Tim Burton's Dark Shadows 2012 (DS12) ranks right up there for me with Mel Brooks's 1974 masterpiece, [[ASIN:B000G6BLWE Young Frankenstein]], which is a hilarious parody of Universal Studios's horror movies of the 1930's, something that DS12 does, at least indirectly, as well. I personally rank this show 4 stars for script, 5 stars for CGI special effects, 5 stars for the elaborate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs, and 5 stars for the beautiful costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. Most of all I give 5+ stars to the actors, in particular Johnny Depp. His acting is always wonderful, but it is a real joy for anyone who loves comedy to see him in a comedic part. He is a master at subtle nuances of expression, making him outstanding as either the one delivering the comic lines, or the straight man receiving them. To me, he is the best part of this film, but it is also a great pleasure to see so many talented supporting actors in the film, especially Eva Green, whose performance is terrific as the villain, Angelique Bouchard, an evil witch.<br /><br />The afternoon soap opera, [[ASIN:B007PZ6SYK Dark Shadows]] (DSTV), on which this film is based, ran on network TV from 1966-1971. Its central character is a handsome vampire, Barnabas Collins, who was portrayed with equal parts anguish and menace by talented actor, Jonathan Frid. His central role is reprised in DS12 by Depp, who has a long, successful history with the film's director, Tim Burton (a partial list of their teamwork includes, [[ASIN:B00004U8P8 Edward Scissorhands]], [[ASIN:B0000VD04M Ed Wood]], [[ASIN:B001BN1ZHW Sweeney Todd]], Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, [[ASIN:0792164903 Sleepy Hollow]], and [[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]]). During the era it was broadcast, DSTV offered its audience an excitingly bizarre mishmash of vampires, witches and werewolves like nothing anyone had ever seen on TV or even in films. In their youth, both Burton and Depp were big fans of the show, and Burton claims it had a major impact on the type of films he would make later in life.<br /><br />DS12 does not try to repeat what DSTV accomplished but rather expands on it. In a fun homage, DS12 is set in the same era as the TV series itself, beginning in 1972, the year after DSTV ended. Burton draws on the classic American tale, Rip Van Winkle, for his plot (a story written by Washington Irving, the 19th-century author on whose work Burton based his film, Sleepy Hollow). Like poor Rip, Barnabas (Depp) is condemned to a long \\"sleep.\\" In his case, the evil witch Angelique, in punishment for rich, 18th-century playboy Barnabas's breaking her heart, turns him into a vampire and buries him in a coffin for a sleep ten times as long as Rip's enchanted slumber in a mountain meadow. Like Rip, when Barnabas escapes his magical imprisonment, he discovers the world he knew has vanished. Instead of staid 1772 (which is also Rip's era), it is now psychedelic, disco-ridden 1972. Barnabas seeks out his ancestral home and learns that the once magnificent estate is now in ruins, and his seriously dysfunctional descendants are strongly in need of his assistance to rebuild the family fortune. They include matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer), her debauched brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), her insolent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and Roger's unstable, young son David (Gulliver/Gully McGrath). The household also includes a meek governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote), an alcoholic caretaker, Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), a senile servant, Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley), and a drunken psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter who, as Tim Burton's wife, is in all his movies).<br /><br />At its peak, DSTV enjoyed a large and loyal following of 20 million fans. It hit the airwaves immediately following the close of two successful comedic monster-movie parodies, The Munsters (1964-1966) and The Addams Family (1964-1966). However, DSTV gained far higher ratings than either of those shows and ran over twice as long, perhaps because DSTV's approach to horror was melodramatic instead of comedic.<br /><br />The Munsters and The Addams Family can obviously be included in the rich tradition of horror parody in motion picture form, starting as early as the 1940's with movies such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), but many fans of DSTV, who regard the show with utmost seriousness, object to anyone characterizing DSTV as a monster parody. However, the stars of DSTV state that the show's attitude toward horror themes was actually, if not comedic, definitely impudent. Actor David Selby, who played Quentin in DSTV, states, \\"Fans who are upset [at Burton for creating a campy parody of the show] have to remember that when we made the series, we screwed with beloved monster movies and turned them upside down!

In addition, Burton cast many of the stars of DSTV in cameos, including Frid, who died very recently at age 87, Selby, Parker, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played Josette. All of these actors have been strong supporters of the film.<br /><br />Burton also cast 90-year-old Christopher Lee in a small part in DS12, as a nod to Lee's famous portrayal of the prototype vampire from literature, [[ASIN:B000JQUBRM Count Dracula]], in multiple movies in the 60's and 70's, the same era as DSTV.<br /><br />To insure he had the best writer to achieve the approach he wanted to take with this film, Burton hired best-selling novelist Seth Grahame-Smith, author of [[ASIN:1594743347 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]], to do the screenplay.

However, the stars of DSTV state that the show's attitude toward horror themes was actually, if not comedic, definitely impudent. Actor David Selby, who played Quentin in DSTV, states, \\"Fans who are upset [at Burton for creating a campy parody of the show] have to remember that when we made the series, we screwed with beloved monster movies and turned them upside down!

B004LAIU4I|2.0|Another carefully engineered musical extravaganza by the master of genre exploitation. While many seem to see Paul Simon as America's cultural ambassador to \\"world (and neglected) music\\", I see him as a vain emperor surrounding himself with exotic plunder for his personal glory. The sight of Simon trying to blues it up, backed up by genuine blues musicians on SNL, was sad and a bit infuriating. Simon is an honest-to-goodness musician, he's just not an honest one, who disguises his own limitations- all artists have them- in this case by placing himself as ringmaster in the middle of a multi-cultural circus. Though there's no denying the infectious melodies and sometimes poetry (sometimes someone else's, as in the case of, \\"Richard Cory\\") of their lyrics, I've always felt that the work of Simon and his partner was concocted- skillfully- rather than inspired- taking a little bit of this, and a little bit of that to make a song \\"work\\". Contrast this, for example, with the influence of American rhythm and blues on the early work of The Beatles. Blue-eyed soul or not, these were kids who were nuts about- even worshipful of- the music. I think that, even at the height of their career, they would never have presumed to \\"belong on the same stage with\\" Little Richard. My suspicions about Paul Simon as musical \\"survivor\\" were confirmed when I first heard the song, \\"American Tune\\", from the album, There Goes Rhymin' Simon. Simon was rhyming' off someone else's tune- namely, J. S. Bach- though that composer's name is nowhere to be found in the credits. Words and music by one Paul Simon! A Rolling Stone critic praised the song as \\"a flowing ballad with the chordal structure of an American hymn-tune\\"; Simon achieved the desired effect, and took the credit with no threat of a lawsuit from that dead German guy. (Yes, I know Bach's hymn was based on a secular song, hence the melody was not original; however, this was a common practice at the time, it was not assumed that tunes were original unless otherwise noted.)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app.  this provides great devotionals, many versions of the bible for study and helps me study Gods word every day.
0060853972|4.0|The first time I read Good Omens, I must have been in my early teens and picked up the dog-eared, cracked-spine copy that was at the public library in Hout Bay. I still remember reading it in my mother's car while she went to check in on my grandparents at the retirement village. The book had been borrowed so often pages were falling out, and the library had tried to tape the volume together.<br /><br />I thought it would be an interesting exercise to trot this novel out again now that more than 15 years have passed since I last read it, and I must admit I have mixed feelings about the work in hindsight. First off, let me say that I absolutely adore Pratchett and Gaiman. I devoured piles of Discworld novels as a teen and Gaiman's Sandman graphic novels had a lasting impact on me. But something about Good Omens is just \\"off\\" for lack of better description.<br /><br />The main gripe I have is that the story suffers from \\"too much awesome\\". Pratchett and Gaiman shoehorned in too many elements which hampered the build-up of tension and resulted in an ending that went out with a whimper rather than a bang. This is the danger of having a large cast of characters and a multiple viewpoints written in an omniscient style. And it's exhausting keeping up with everyone, with scenes that flitter hither and thither.<br /><br />A big problem with this story, I feel, is the humour, which is possibly the reason why I failed to finish Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and also can only stomach Pratchett's writing in isolated servings. Much like Monty Python and his ilk, I can only tolerate this sort of humour in small servings, and I always want it tempered by presenting it within a stronger narrative. I found the constant dry commentary exhausting after about a third of the novel and, consequently, struggled to finish reading all the way to the end. So yes, a large part of my feelings of meh-ness toward this novel lies with me. I don't think I am quite the reader for this novel.<br /><br />Granted, I did find the authors' characterisations amusing, but to get back to that comment of \\"too much awesome\\"... The novel loses steam early on so much so that I think the only way to really enjoy it is to read it in short bursts over a few weeks instead of an intense sitting.<br /><br />Good Omens is a stab at some of the classic 1980s horror, with a big nod to works such as The Omen. If you enjoyed that story, then you'll probably pick up a few of the hints tossed into Good Omens. The only character I felt an inkling of affection for was Adam and his dog, and feel if the story had been centred more around his doings and his gang, it might've had more impact. Some readers have complained that the story's \\"too preachy\\" and that it descends into moral nihilism. Maybe it's just that I tend toward nihilism at times that this didn't bother me too much. It's quite clear that far more people love this story than hate it, and it must be remembered that the reader is the final arbiter.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Good Omens gets bogged down by its large cast of characters, multiple story arcs and by its reliance on its own cleverness. I did appreciate the skits, which are Pythonesque at times, and this is not the best offering from either author. I can see where they come from, and probably conceived this novel out of a conversation where a number of \\"what ifs\\" were dropped. Granted, this is still a fun, light-hearted read which takes a stab at contemporary society and, for that alone, is worth reading. At no point did I feel like flinging the book across the room either, but I'll echo what a lot of other readers have said. If you want to see Gaiman or Pratchett at their best, rather look to staple fare such as the Discworld novels, the Sandman graphic novels and American Gods.der for this novel.<br /><br />Granted, I did find the authors' characterisations amusing, but to get back to that comment of \\"too much awesome\\"...

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read about the novels in Time magazine and loved the authors rags to riches tale, so I picked up the book in my local book store and sat down to read.  My initial thoughts about the book from the first half dozen chapters or so was that it resembled some erotic airport novels I read in the 1980s.. steamy, explicit, but no great depth.  However I soon became gripped by the psychological complexity of Christian Grey and found his story very interesting, but also poignant and sad.  Ms James does a great job of building a character with deep psychological wounds and flaws which explain his predilection.  Ana is a feisty heroine whose own unwrapping and unwinding is so interesting to watch.  Short review - have to go and start the next one...

1250006341|5.0|This is a great book to delight fans of Downton Abbey and guide them to a better appreciation of the Edwardian Era.  The best way to describe this book is that it is as beautiful to look at as it is to read.  It is more than a coffee table book with rich glossy pictures, and much more than a fan tribute with behind the scenes photos of filming on set.  While there are some comments from the actors to add some spice, Jessica Fellowes takes the same care and attention as her uncle Julian Fellowes to use the Crawley story line to pay tribute to the grand country houses like Highclere Castle where Downton is filmed. She teaches us about Edwardian life and the back story of the characters that we have come to know and love; while it was a different time, some things never change, like devotion to family.  It is like taking a history on the Edwardian era, using Downton Abbey as the teaching tool.  I would not be surprised if American universities will be launching courses using Downton as a backdrop.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes writes the Foreword as homage to these great houses which were mostly abandoned after the collapse of the agricultural economy.  Some were rescued and reinvented as new families used the grand space in different ways.  Sadly the vast kitchen and ante rooms behind the green baise door had to go.  An interesting tidbit was his reference to his great-aunt Isie who was the model for the Violet Grantham character.<br /><br />There are many books written about this era, some with connections to Downton Abbey which Amazon all carry, but this is a great one to start with.<br /><br />I covered this review on my own blog DowntonAbbeyCooks, dedicated to the food and recipes of Downton Abbey and the great Edwardian Era. As a foodie, I was quite happy that Jessica spent time on a typical menu which would have been enjoyed at Downton as well the kitchen and my favorite servants Mrs. Patmore and Daisy.

0345803485|4.0|I just finished reading this book, and although it won't change my marriage, it did have some food for thought. It certainly isn't porography, it more like a how to book for virgins, since that is what the main character is. I really don't see a man and woman with 2 kids creating a \\"red room of pain\\" for sexual pleasure, but for an inexperienced female this book would be an eye opener. For me the message was in an intimate or close relationship trust is the number one sucess maker. Even though she is avirgin and he is fully versed, they come together to create a couple that learns to trust each other. At times the book is humorous, other times erotic. The characters are young- mid 20's. I really don't see a comparison to twilight- the story lines are totally different, and twilight is not erotic. As far as being censored from libraries, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is much moe explicit and violent in it's sex scenes. All in all the book was fun while it lasted, but I won't be reading the other 2 in the series, they seem like they would be a continuation of the same.

B005NKGEP2|5.0|I could not put this book (well, my iPad) down. Suspenseful, psychologically complex, and just plain fun. Each of the 4 main characters has something to hide, and the author does a fantastic job parceling out the information bit by bit, for maximum effect. I was amazed to find that this is Pavone's first novel...and also disappointed, as this means I can't go back and read his other books.
0345803485|1.0|After all the hullaballoo about this book and how it's being labelled as \\"mommy porn\\" I decided to give it a read.  What a huge letdown it was!  First and foremost, the writing is atrocious or perhaps maybe amateurish is a better way to put it.  Second, the erotica is virtually nonexistent!  THIS is what's getting the 30 and over set all hot and bothered?  My fellow males, you need to up your game if women think that this is in any way adventurous!  I don't consider these spoilers, as it doesn't really involve plot (ha, ha) but be warned that I am going to mention some of the supposed erotica from the book and when it takes place...<br />It takes four chapters before there is even a KISS in this book.  It takes 120 pages before some really boring sex takes place!  The sex that occurs from that point until the end of the book - what little there is of it - is not all that exciting.  I finished this book and am totally perplexed as to why anyone would think it has any kind of passion or heat.<br />As a public service announcement, let me direct you to FAR better erotica written WAY better by an author you've heard of.  Anne Rice (Interview with the Vampire) wrote several books of erotic fiction that simply destroy this one.  The Sleeping Beauty trilogy (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release) was released under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure and are written in Anne Rice's usual descriptive prose.  We get to the action quicker, it's an interesting take on charaters you're familiar with, and you can read the writing without getting a headache!  Also written by Anne Rice under the pseudonym Anne Rampling is Exit to Eden, which is set in present day, involves an island of erotica, and is again way better than Fifty Shades.  Ignore the fact that they made a horrid movie out of it starring Rosie O'Donnell of all people, and read the book!  You won't be sorry.  You WILL be sorry if you pick up Fifty Shades of Grey.

B0064NTZJO|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Drive. It's been a few months since I've seen it and honestly, I don't remember much of anything except the final shot. That's only because it was the most interesting part of the film for me. I'll lay out seven points in regards to my final thoughts:<br /><br />1) The action scenes are interesting, but not tense or particularly memorable. I remember the hammer scene only because it was featured prominently in the trailer.<br /><br />2) The style was definitely rockin', but the film seems more interested in creating a mood instead of interesting characters. Silence in regards to actors standing around doesn't build anything except, well, silence.<br /><br />3) The brief car chase in Drive was indeed pretty badass. Refn's technique is incredible in this sequence.<br /><br />4) The chemistry between Mulligan and Gosling felt forced. For man capable of great violence, his shift in tone is jarring and seems unwarranted. We're given reasons to care, but no implementation.<br /><br />5) Albert Brooks exhibits a profoundly radical shift in acting persona, and steals the show. Ron Perlman has a nice little nasty turn. Brian Cranston is nice as a ferret-like agent.<br /><br />6) All of the supporting characters are more interesting than the two leads.<br /><br />7) The climax is patently unsatisfying. I do not expect an epic showdown, but the methods used to showcase the fight were confusing and -- frankly -- uninteresting. However, the final shot leaves the film open and provided a rush of emotion.<br /><br />For my blog, [...]<br /><br />--Nick

B005LAIIS0|4.0|Spoilers referenced<br /><br />A job at the end of the world. Stuck in the bleak arctic, Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a sniper hired by an oil crew to protect them against the worst nature has. With his dark past very present in his mind, he boards a company airplane home with an oil crew as uncivilized as the landscape. After a random storm, the plane crashes in a frozen hell of ravenous wolves and unforgiving conditions. With only wits and ebbing resources, Ottway realizes they are being stalked by a pack of wolves. And it becomes a race between species to out-fight the other as the cold blizzard brings most certain death.<br /><br />And it is not just man against nature. It is man versus death.<br /><br />As the opening voice over narrates the futility of a life devoid of meaning, Ottway is preparing to commit suicide. With his heart broken and his spirit in pieces, The Grey begins where most stories about redemption end. Neeson, with his gravelly voice and sunken eyes, is the last candidate I expected to find in this story, touted as \\"Taken\\" with wolves. As advertised, The Grey was touted as Liam Neeson kicking ass and making slippers out of the remains of wolf.<br /><br />Instead, we get a soulful and complex figure haunted by the demons of the past, as well as the specter of death, and Neeson transcends his own acting action film persona to give us a character who is both fragile and strong. A man who bleeds and begs of the Divine to save him. The scene that involves Neeson literally screaming and cursing the Divine is both chilling in it's realism and horrifying when we realize that he might actually be right. The scene is so profound when one thinks about the personal background of Neeson, who lost his wife several years before.<br /><br />When taken in that way, the scene that has now become inescapably haunting in my mind is all the more visceral and real. I wasn't certain it was Ottway who was screaming at the Divine, but Neeson. Though, I've heard that Neeson is a Roman Catholic, even the best of us find it crushing to even consider the hand of the Divine in the midst of unspeakable tragedy.<br /><br />Indeed, death gets quite a bit of screen time, both in conversation and action, with the wolves manipulating the group, and the fights are sparse but vicious and brutal. But that is not the point of the story, and director Joe Carnahan (The A-Team) doesn't dwell on the gore, only using it to point to the wider philosophical spectrum. The musical score is sparse, and allows the film to set it's own pace, which allows for the silences to speak louder about the characters. There are scenes of graphic violence involving people's in a state of shock being ripped apart, but the images are often beautiful in their transcendent power. The violence is not the point.<br /><br />Death, and how we deal with it, is the point. It is cold, calculating, and inescapable. Like God's judgment, there is nothing we can do to be free of it's curse. At least, for now.<br /><br />I sat on my couch for three hours last night, pondering the philosophical concepts of The Grey. I didn't remember the blood, the jump scenes, the scenery, the music or the acting; though all of that is outstanding. But, The Grey is not about the wolves, or even about Liam Neeson. It is first and foremost a story about God, and where He is when suffering bares it's fangs. The film is not necessarily interested in answering the provocative questions it presents, nor should it, but it presents them in the midst of transcendent emotion and complex spirituality.<br /><br />The ending is akin to The Sopranos, and it will divide audiences. I personally felt it ended on a pitch-perfect note, both ambiguous and gripping. It allows it's themes to fully remain intact without succumbing to cliche, and frankly, it is refreshing to see a film end a film on it's own terms, rather than on the expectations of it's audience.<br /><br />The twist that is revealed will not rock your world,but the climactic build up to it had tears in my eyes. It forces us to look beyond the present state of chaos and focus on what gives life meaning. And does that meaning involving more than an instinct for survival?<br /><br />Once more into the fray<br />Into the last good fight I'll ever know<br />Live and die on this day<br />Live and die on this day<br /><br />Come for the wolves, stay for the rest.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|His father was a drinker<br />And his mother cried in bed<br />Folding John Wayne's t-shirts<br />When the swingset hit his head<br /><br />Based on Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is decidedly David Fincher's best film, and decidedly his most morally thematic. The story follows a disgraced journalist named Mikael (Daniel Craig) who is hired by an old Swedish patriarch to uncover an unsolved murder that has festered away for over 40 years. In over his head, Mikael brings aboard a computer specialist and muckraker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Together, they begin to unravel a family tapestry of deceit, ambiguity and the nature of radical depravity.<br /><br />The neighbors they adored him<br />For his humor and his conversation<br />Look underneath the house there<br />Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep<br />Oh, the dead<br /><br />Filled with gloomy shots that evoke living shadows and naked corridors, TGWTDT is both haunting and cold, not unlike most of Fincher's work. The constant tension of rain and snow and cold contributes to the overall gentle horror that the narrative conjures up. Dealing especially with sexuality and the abuse of it, Fincher and writer Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) spare no expense in showcasing extreme brutality. The much-talked about rape scene never cuts away through much of the act, but the subsequent fallout of physical degradation experienced by the character truly doesn't blink. While I'm not convinced that showcasing the entire forced sexual act was necessary, it does paint a painful and gut-wrenching aftermath of emotional and physical turmoil. Frankly, I'm not certain about if it was justified, so I will simply leave my concerns right where they lay.<br /><br />Twenty-seven people<br />Even more, they were boys<br />With their cars, summer jobs<br />Oh my God<br />Are you one of them?<br /><br />He dressed up like a clown for them<br />With his face paint white and red<br />And on his best behavior<br />In a dark room on the bed<br />He kissed them all<br /><br />Though bolstered by a solid performance by Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara inhabits Lisbeth like a second skin. This is her show, and she commands every scene she is in. She is a woman who is in tight control of herself, but when she slips, it is truly apocalyptic. Her retributive encounter with a rapist is as brutal as the rape scene itself, but is ambiguous in the sense of whether or not her vengeance fulfills. I'm inclined to see it not as a feminist retaliation, which is likely what the authors and filmmakers intended, but as a very human response and a desire for control. Of course, they could be the same thing. As those who control her did awful things, so must she do everything she can to regain said control. Like I said, Fincher thrives on ambiguity and the film feels slightly scattered because of it.

The film is darker than most of the film's I've sat through, and I would not recommend this to most of my friends. On a purely technical basis, this film is flawless. The storytelling is compact, with only scattered instances of exposition, and the imagery is simultaneously harsh and haunting. I'm predicting several nominations, among them Best Actress and Director.<br /><br />The biggest flaw seems to be the ending, which is almost too quiet for it's own good. It seems as if Fincher wanted to keep the ambiguity, but in the end, it felt anti-climactic. This does not derail the film, but it feels forced. Perhaps this is simply realism.

B0028R3NCU|5.0|i bought one of these about 3 months ago to use with one of the many micro SD cards i have laying around and it has performed wonderfully with my 16GB card in it. today i just bought 5 more so i can use the pile of micro SD cards i have in my junk drawer as flash drives. no complaints here at 4 bucks a pop its well worth it.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|I heard about it, these new sounds they were coming out with and maybe I am onboard with it real late but forgive my ignorance as every DJ up till this point sounds like poop spring break dance club resort and really doesnt impress me at all quite frankly its not even an art in my mind...I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE IT these sounds are absolutely original well collaborated and makes you think wow how did he do this?IT is an absolute art ... just incredible real sound that keeps you guessing and enjoying it ...one song sucks is right on time it sounds like some club song but thats it...everything else was well worth money...I didnt realize that this skrillex dude also did KORNS Narcissistic Cannibal....like I said late in the game but I might even buy his other stuff too. I liked all of it
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I just finished this book and I am completely blown away by it. It is my favorite in the series so far and was almost impossible for me to put down. Jon and Arya are my two favorite characters and I think they really come into their own in this book. Tyrion's chapters were also really strong and we finally get a glimpse into the mind of Jamie Lannister. There are some huge twists in the book that had me just sitting there with my mouth hanging open for 20 minutes before I was finally able to recover. I'm usually pretty good at guessing the huge plot twists in books and had some luck with it in the first two, but I did not see ANY of them coming in A Storm of Swords.
0226264211|5.0|First off, this little book is entertaining as a text and a history. For example, early editions complain that the post office shouldn't be the only ones to deliver mail, and Bell shouldn't be the only company providing phone service. Friedman claims we'd have more innovation if both of those monopolies were busted. Oh, how true. This leads credibility to his further claim that capitalism is what makes freedom possible. This more theoretical idea i treated quite fairly, and I think, accurately. It concerns me that many politicians are now pushing for less of both in the US.
B00138KD5A|5.0|Its James Taylor!  What could be bad.  Great price, I downloaded it straight from Amazon, every file was perfect.  This has to be the best way to buy music ever. And the easiest.
B002MW50KO|2.0|First, I need to say that I own every Dylan CD available, and absolutely LOVE most for one reason or another. I also completely accept that Bob is working his way through lots of styles -- some more 'listenable' than others. I'm reluctant to be harsh on a new style. Many end up growing on me later. So far, this one isn't even sprouting on me. I slipped a couple songs into our Christmas playlist, and they always result in my wife giving me the evil eye. So, why did I give it two stars instead on only one? It's Dylan. IMO, there's no such thing as a one star Dylan CD:)
0345803485|1.0|I found this book to be a disappointment and a huge waste of time and money.  In fact, I bailed before the \\"story\\" got to any sexy parts.  The characters were so shallow and unrealistic that it was impossible for me to identify with them.  And, the dialogue was stilted and artificial.  In my opinion, it was the most poorly written book I've come across since the DaVinci Codes.
0060555661|4.0|It is hard to argue with Warren Buffett when he says this is the best book on investing ever written. It is less hard to argue that a newer book that includes modern value investing tools would go a long way towards being more useful. Nevertheless, this is well written and interesting. It is just hard to imagine how people did all that research back in the days of slide rules and stone tablets:)
0345803485|1.0|All in all I was excited to receive these in the mail.  But when I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey, it felt sophmoric.  After everything I have read about these novels, I was expecting great writing.  Not unlike Anais Nin.  But all I have read so far is Oh crap.  Reads like a High School sex notebook.
1591391105|5.0|I've now read this twice and recommended it many more times to colleagues who have been promoted into engineering management. I can't say that it will have the same impact on everyone, but engineers seem to find these analytic methods easy to digest. In particular I like the idea of dividing your conversations with your new boss into distinct conversations. They start with questions to learn situational awareness (is this a turn around or a continuing success situation?), and save the conversation about resources that the boss will provide (like career guidance) until later. Save yourself a trip through the mine field, and read this as soon as you can after your promotion.
0345529057|5.0|A person I used to know got me involved with this series and I have been engaged with it for years now awaiting the newer book. I have never been so excited for a book to come out before. Was well worth the years and now they have a TV series even!
0316010669|5.0|This 'series of shorts' is a great way to pass an airplane ride. But be careful, you might find a subject or two you want more info on. This particular book led me to several other purchases. Some were quite interesting. Others were so obtuse I was left wondering how Gladwell found an interesting subject in them.
B004I744AS|5.0|There are several different types of dictionaries especially when you are seaching for biblical words. This one has helped me out tremendously. Thank you.<br /><br />I got this dictionary from Amazon app store for free.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This company puts out some of the most fun game apps.  Reminds me of the old computer adventure games like discworld, dig, monkey island etc.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|Wow! What a comeback! I got got worried after Octohedron, that maybe they were getting tired and losing their edge. I'm glad I was wrong. I won't break down each song, but taken as a whole, this is one album that belongs in every prog-rock fan's collection. I don't get the impression that they intend to amaze us with their musical brilliance, it just happens that way when brilliant musicians play (and write) whats in their hearts.
0553801473|3.0|Just a couple of hundred pages into the book and am a little disappointed. So far not as enthused about this book as the first four. Partially due to a lot of backfill for some of the main characters. Martin does give fair warning of the format and content in the introduction. I'm going to keep at it and hope the story line progresses. Suspect this might be a lead-in to the \\"final\\" book.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Awsome app that does exactly what it says.  Works fantastic I use it weekly to reminder. Do me to pay bills a day ahead of time
B007M6P01O|5.0|This was the first time I ordered a video to watch and I was impressed how easy it was. I would totally order like this again. The Walking Dead is so on the edge of your seat, and I can't wait for the new season to start.
B0039UTDFG|4.0|I own most every BBC Earth nature documentary and I appreciate what goes in to making these incredible films.  \\"Life\\" is an incredible series and I highly recommend to everyone, but the version narrated by David Attenborough.  I was born and raised in the U.S. but the Americanized versions of the BBC Earth documentaries (for the most part) are terrible due to the choice of narrator.  They typically are not knowledgeable about the material, and make the video almost unbearable (e.g., Oprah, Alex Baldwin in Frozen Planet, Mike Rowe in Human Planet, etc.).  The actual video content is truly incredible and anyone interested in life on Earth should purchase Life narrated by David Attenborough.  This goes for every BBC Earth documentary.  If possible (exception is Human Planet narrated by John Hurt who does a good job) get the version narrated by David Attenborough.
B006ISJQ26|5.0|Brian DePalma was considered a master plagiarist by many.  It's with little irony that \\"London Boulevard\\" reminds you of DePalma's \\"Carlito's Way\\".  Director William Monahan also references Martin Scorsese which also ironically Monahan wrote the Oscar winning script for \\"The Departed\\" which was a reimagining of the Hong Kong crime thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\".  The question you ask yourself is Monahan's effort more than the sum of it's influences?  The answer to me is a resounding yes.  Similarities to other films cannot be denied but when done right you call it a homage.  Monahan introduces enough unique fluorishes and twists to elevate it above mere copycat status.  Colin Farrell is magnetic and macho as the recently released con who wants to go straight in a world that keeps pulling him into a life of crime.  Ray Winstone adds another indelible portrait to his personal rogues gallery as a sadistic crime boss.  David Thewlis nearly steals the show as the foppish manager of Keira Knightley's papparazzi stalked movie starlet.  The film kept me rapt and invigorated throughout.  For those who would dismiss \\"London Boulevard\\" as derivative I ask you to consider Bogart, Cagney, and Edward G.  They were gangster archetypes who didn't play the same character twice.  \\"London Boulevard\\" is a variation of the British gangster tradition that includes \\"Get Carter\\", \\"The Long Good Friday\\", \\"Mona Lisa\\" and \\"Sexy Beast'.
B007SSDS24|2.0|American's in Moscow during alien invasion.  Not too high a budget, but not done badly.  Interesting \\"aliens\\".  But got bored  with it and did not finish it.
1430308001|5.0|I heard about this book on another website where someone suggested it to another person looking for a tactics book to buy.  I expected a wolf on the cover growling and salivating.  So I come to amazon and look up the book and to my amazement I find what must be one of the top ten coolest chess book covers ever!  Then I thought about the cover and the name combined and was totally sold on buying his set of books.  You don't come across brilliant covers and names of books very often, so I decided to buy them both and check them out.  Well I went to the publisher site and bought the hard covers, so i cannot comment on the quality of the paperback books, but the hard cover books are quite excellent.<br /><br />At first I was quite impressed with the introduction, but got a little worried when i started the Knight Fork section cause it was definitely for beginners.  However as i proceeded to read the book, there were tons of little gold nuggets on how to think and what to look for that you do not find in other tactics books - at least not the ones that i have. The positions start out very simple and slowly progress to more and more difficult levels.  What I am finding is that the slow progression and excellently chosen positions that he uses to explain his message, are helping me retain the ideas, unlike most tactic books where you are supposed to somehow learn subconscious patterns which might help a little because solving problems or puzzles in practice makes perfect. Now for my honesty.  I am only on page 45 in which i believe 35 of it has been knight forks (to include removing of the guard and rearranging your opponents pieces via tactics).  I believe in total there is 56 pages in the Double Attack section on Knight Forks alone.  You can look inside the book and check it out which is nice on the amazon site, but do not be fooled and think that only a beginner will be helped by these books.  There is over 700 pages of positions, explanations, and little nuggets of gold throughout the book.  These are NOT!!! your normal tactics books where you solve a bunch of puzzles and forget them all in a few days.  These books use tons of very clear positions with very good explanations not on just how to solve the problem but on how to actually think and what to look for in advance - even tells you how to spot tactical opportunities that other tactics books just don't teach!<br /><br />Well I am so excited about these books i had to write a pre-review.  I will come back later and add more info when i can.  If you do not buy these books for any other reason than to collect them cause of their uniqueness, then buy them to support such wonderful works.d throughout the book.

0547569653|4.0|(My copy is vine draft copy, book may change.)<br /><br />I loved  reading Born to Run and read it about 4 times and recoomended it to others. This is Scotts version of his life  of running and drive to win. I was hooked form the first two pages, and read it non-stop at work for about6 hrs.<br />I just started as accidental vegan in jan , so the rescipes were nice.<br />Cons, the rescipes need work, the granola rescipe is missing directions, What do I do with the milk, soak then drain? The ingrediant list is long and daunting for some, and I like to cook, when I saw the pancake rescipe, I just wanted to buy a mix, and I love to cook!<br />Scott hits us over the head again and again about diet, it gets a bit boring. Many of the foods he uses are imported, not local and very high calorie count.<br />The assistance of an extra writer was wise. I feel the book could still use a rewrite, esp in the middle sections, I enjoyed it,  but doubt I will reread it, unlike Born to Run. The scope of the book is narrow, just really a personal journey. I will try some of the recipes.<br />Thanks for the excellant notes in the back, for future reading.
