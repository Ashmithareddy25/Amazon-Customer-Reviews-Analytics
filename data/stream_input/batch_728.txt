B000R7I3LY|5.0|Some of the other reviews couldn't have said it better.  This is one album where all of the tracks can be listened to repeatedly without getting tired of them.  Bareilles' songs are a great combination of light rock, soul, and pop.  I became interested in the album when the Amazon review said it was for fans of Sarah Mclachlan and Alicia Keys.  Though I am a fan of their music, it does tend to get too \\"soft\\" for me, as a previous reviewer mentions.  Imagine my pleasure when I listened to the first track \\"Love Song,\\" which was definitely rockin' (need another example?  Listen to the opening of \\"Morningside\\" - so cool).  Many of the other songs continued on the track set by \\"Love Song,\\" and increased my listening pleasure even more.  Even the gentler songs have lovely melodies that are fun to listen to.  Like the other reviewers, I'm very addicted to this album right now.  Rarely is there an album where every single track is unique yet enjoyable, perfect complements to each other and so fun to experience.  Favorite tracks: \\"Between the Lines,\\" \\"Many the Miles,\\" \\"Fairytale,\\" \\"Bottle it Up,\\" \\"One Sweet Love,\\" \\"Love Song,\\" \\"Come Round Soon\\"... oh heck, let's just say all of them!  Oh and how can I forget?  Awesome voice! Go Bruins!
1577314808|5.0|This book is life changing. It is the way of life.  An easy read- although should be relished over and over.  Once you catch on, 'your' life will never be the same! There is no need to ever buy another self help book again- and you are free to sell all of your others on Amazon as they will no longer be needed.
0321344758|4.0|I've been developing web pages for around 7 years. The only thing I can say is I can't believe I never researched usability until now. This book definitely opened my eyes to a whole new aspect of the world of web design.    If you are new to web usability, or if you're a \\"one stop shop\\" or a \\"one-man show\\", I highly recommend this book. If you're new to web development, I HIGHLY recommend this book - I wish I had learned about usability from day one!     If you're already familiar with web usability or work as part of a team, this book may not be as useful as some of the other books out there.    The only thing that kept this book from getting five stars is that the first 40 or so pages fell out of the binding (but stayed together, thankfully.. I was sort of able to glue them back in) within the first few days. I did leave the book open which placed stress on the spine, but still... I've never had that happen to me with any book before. Hopefully a future version will solve this little problem.

6305882592|5.0|\\"Harold and Maude\\" is my all time favorite movie. It is a cult film. I saw it in theaters 36 times! Back in the day, theaters would show it at midnight like they do for Rocky Horrow nowadays. Anyway, this movie tells about life. It says something about being young. It says something about being old. It says something about living a HAPPY life. I think we all can learn from this.<br />Ruth Gordon is my hero. Budd Court is the boyfriend I never had. I love them both. All this coupled with a Cat Stevens soundtrack. I am in heaven! I love this movie!<br />Sheree Rensel<br />[...]
B0006B7MS6|1.0|One expects more for the $35 + price on this DVD.   You are better off purchasing one of the $7 -$12 DVD versions offered by others.  The color in the Golden Classic Collectibles version is just about non-existent.  We had to reset our TV color setting to maximum in order to see a modest color enhancement; which wasn't much.  The sound is muffled at some points, and for those hard of hearing, the English captioning has mis-spelling, and omits random sentences and words.  All in - - a VERY POOR quality offering for such a high price.  I regret purchasing this Golden Classic version.   Too bad Amazon doesn't have some sort of rating system for these DVD knockoff's.  Until then, customer reviews will have to do.
B000Y179KO|4.0|I was not a BIG Eagles fan, but I always liked what I considered their best work: Hotel California, Take It Easy, Tequila Sunrise - the hits, I guess.<br />I also felt they lacked depth in their lyrics and their albums were always spotty - not consistently good throughout the album.<br /><br />So I didn't expect much at all from this one.<br /><br />First of all, most \\"reunion\\" albums by old farts from the 70's usually don't turn out too well. Secondly, I figured they were just getting together for a payday.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The very first track is awesome. Sounds a little \\"Venice\\"-like, but that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />I won't go through it song by song because it would just be my subjective opinion, and a waste of time.<br /><br />The point is, I think any Eagles fan, no matter whether you are a fan of Walsh, Frey, Henley or Schmit, you will find enough really good tracks here to enjoy this album.<br /><br />Now the bad news, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars:<br /><br />Guess what, the Eagles are STILL spotty. They can't make a 100% great album without a lot of \\"filler\\" tracks. I think a person could pretty easily edit this 2 cd set down to one cd and end up with one very good 4 and 1/2 to 5 star cd.<br /><br />So if you're an Eagles fan, buy this set. I can't figure out why it has so many 1 and 2 star reviews. I would expect to find mostly 4 and 5 star reviews.

0060832819|1.0|That should be the title of this book.     In this \\"masterpiece\\" we, the innocent and defenseless readers are \\"treated\\" to Coelho's vision of love (i.e., that it can happen in an instant, that it has the power to change the world (really?), and that loving one does not mean that you cannot love others (Frequently. Carnally. And even without feeling guilty.).     The novel is ostensibly about someone who loses his wife (although we are told, several times, that authors cannot write books about anything but themselves (as if everyone is as creatively impotent as Coelho), we are also told that the book is not about HIM...of course its not, Paolo...we understand...) He then begins to obsess about her, whereas before he is foolishly unappreciative. By the end of the novel, the author has had several \\"life-changing\\" interactions (hence the proposed title), most of which involve one or two people speaking like Jesus. Here's a hint for all of you that enjoy this book: People who talk like this in real life don't sound urbane, witty, erudite, or eloquent. They sound smug and no one listens to them. One gets the feeling that everyday, normal conversations are ported through Coelho's \\"Wouldn't it be cool if...\\" machine that turns all conversations into pseudo-intelligent sounding discussions. But they aren't. People just aren't that interesting, and they don't talk like that. If this were accurate, there would be someone beyond the author's girlfriend who hung on to his every word. Lickspittle sycophants, like every author conglomerates, like it or not, who appear somewhere in the story. But there aren't. Instead, there is merely this idea of a Favor Bank (imagine what that might be!?!?!) and the author's unwilling (but oh-so necessary) participation, and his self-aggrandizing, asinine comments about how much better he is than those people.    In normal cases, I wouldn't conflate the author with the main character, but, since this is Coelho, and his main character (in the book) wrote all of the same books that Coelho had written, I won't bother pretending that the two aren't one. So, any comments that I make about the author should be interpreted to be about this idea of his main character as well.    It's standard boilerplate trash, actually. I would give it 1.5 stars if I could, because there is one redeeming fact about it: the author clearly wrote it as a celebration of his love for something (although it was most likely for himself, as he seems to lack the capacity to love anything more than his own ego).     In it, we are subjected (SEVERAL TIMES!!!) to his discussions about his motives for writing (because he is egotistical, and thinks that there is some message in his work that the world needs to hear), about what his work means (nothing, as nearly as I can tell), about the critics (ignorant, plebian naysayers who contribute nothing to society), etc. It is half awful story with shoddy characterization and no (believable)character development    Perhaps the most amusing part of the book is when the author claims that those who are popular are not worthwhile, while those who are hated are probably prophetic. I wonder about those whom people are ambivalent about? It is amusing to me that the book contains that information and still has all the statements on it about being an international bestseller, having sold millions of copies, Coelho being a beloved author, etc. Does that mean that the line was tongue-in-cheek, and that he intentionally did it, just to jab at himself? This kind of awareness would be nice...but I don't think that his ego could take it.    Don't get me wrong. The author has plenty of moments where he appears to accept that he is no better than anyone else. But he never seems to believe it. Through it all, his smug face is smiling at us with a benevolent and condescending smile from the back cover. He doesn't believe it when he says that he is nothing. He might THINK that he believes it, but he doesn't. He never will. He is way to convinced of his superiority to accept it.    But, all that aside, it is possible that out there are 10 persons who will benefit from reading this book. It is possible that there is a message inside that a few people in the world need to hear. Why are the millions of others reading this, though? It is garbage. It is a cotton candy for your brain: seemingly substantial, filling, and yummy, but devoid of any nutritive value and instead just preventing USEFUL things from taking that space.     As a final note, to those who are amazed by the fact that Coelho seems to read in English as you imagine that he does in Portugese (or Spanish. Or French. Or Russian. Or Cantonese. Or Serbian. Or ...), how can you be so surprised? The language is so simple that a person with one year of experience in a foreign language could translate it. It is simple to the point of vapidity and being nauseating.    Don't read it. Not even if you are recommended to. It is trash. D.
B000PWQPAC|4.0|I'd have to agree with others who have described this movie as more of an extended television episode.  It's not got the same impact as the previous movies, but it's still quite good.  Good story, familiar characters, I enjoyed it!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I became a huge John Waters fan after his original film version of \\"Hairspray\\" hit the big screen. Then came \\"Cry Baby\\" which was nearly as good. Waters lived through these years in Baltimore and wrote what he saw with a bit of a \\"twist\\".  When the DVD of Water's \\"Hairspray\\" came out on DVD I raved about it, mainly `cause it now had his commentary - which was hilarious.<br /><br />The Broadway musical version of \\"Hairspray\\" takes Waters' original and pumps up the energy a few notches and then - through set design and costume makes it more colorful than one could expect. Mark Shaiman's music is so full of hooks that you will find yourself humming along on first viewing and then trying to get the tunes out of your head for days. And the lyrics - while not written by Waters sure capture his sense of humor.<br /><br />There are two versions of the DVD out there. One is a bare bones single disc. But this two-Disc version is the one to buy. The \\"extras\\" are hours and hours long! There are TWO separate full-length commentaries (sadly Waters is on neither of them) plus five deleted scenes. There a 35 minute or so \\"making of\\" documentary and a fabulous three part \\"Roots of Hairspray\\" featurette that gives background on Waters and his films  as well as a nice look at Buddy Dean - the actual Baltimore TV dance party host that the \\"Hairspray\\" character Corny Collins is patterned after.  There's a featurette on the dance numbers performed and - my favorite - the Sing Along \\"Karaoke\\" feature. There's few more bonuses as well that are minor.<br /><br />This is a great \\"Generation Gap\\" film and DVD. Those in their 60s will remember the early days of \\"Bandstand\\" (even before it became \\"American Bandstand\\" and those in their teens and 20s can see what it was like in America during the time both before, and after, racial integration. Used as a springboard for discussions about \\"what it was like growing up then\\" between parents and their teens, this is a great way to share some common entertainment. After all, the  dance party shows of the 60s are not that much different than the Disney Channel \\"High School Musical\\" shows of the current day.<br /><br />All the major stores seem to be promoting sales in this new release and so the prices will come way down.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Rock & roll with a message - what more could you want? Some of the most finely crafted songs with the full band that Bruce has given us in a long time. I find it more compelling than The Rising, and it gets better with repeated listening. As a bonus, each song seems to connect back with one of the old ones. My only criticism is the producer (O'Byrne?) who may have freshened up Bruce's sound, but at the expense of somewhat marginalizing the E Street Band. P.S., send a prayer out to Danny Federici if you would during this tough time.

B000WTBMBK|5.0|Anonymous UK dubstepping phenom Burial has smoothly taken the decaying trip hop genre and shoved it into the 21st century. UNTRUE is a muted, whispery masterpiece with scratchy percussive dance beats and coiled echoing vocals; sorta like listening outside some underground London nightclub marked only by a humming caged blue light by its entrance. Awesomely addictive, with a seductive texture, this record is well on its way to making every Top 10 list for 2007, and speaks highly to what someone can do with a personal computer and an endless sonic imagination.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|This review is for anyone on the fence because they already own the remastered catalogue.  Forget it!  Those remasters don't hold even the tiniest candle to the soundstage present on this compilation.  The soundstage is broad, its wide, spacious, incredible amounts and bottom end that is both warm and punchy.  The subtleties of even these collected hard rockers are all now seeing the light of day.  The amount of separation between the instrumental groups and the vocals is amazing.  Finally, Zep's rhythm section gets its due and JPJ's bass lines don't sound like mud and the drums, wow, do they resonate with a power not heard in these recordings before.  Basically, buy this set if the music means anything to you.  Sure, its more of the same and the song list is missing some key items, BUT that all shrinks into complete insignificance when you sit and listen to the demonstration quality audio of this set.  I hope that Page and Co. decide to give the rest of their catalogue the same treatment, because....well...Physical Graffiti, Houses of the Holy, III with this remastering would be completely new revelations.
B00012QM8G|5.0|i wish i could give this film 10 stars. it's absolutely amazing.    i've been wanting to see this movie for as long as i can remember but i never got the chance to, till now. i wonder what took me so long!    \\"Schindler's List\\" is one of the very few movies that gets me crying. every second of it is just so enjoyable, every part of it is just filled w/passion and zeal. even though war is ugly and it brings out the nastiest side of humans, this movie makes you forget all that. instead, the main character's (Oskar Schindler) kind heart compels you to believe that there's a good side worth recognizing in every so called 'bad' person.    i adore this movie because well i'm a sucker for passionate films that have the potential to get me tearing up. this movie did just that! and i'm so happy that i saw it (1 minute ago).    now THIS is a MUST-SEE film! screw the rest, watch THIS

B00006J9OT|5.0|This CD, &quot;Live In Paris,&quot; produced by Tommy LiPuma for Verve Records is one of my favorite Diana Krall CDs. It won the most-coveted award for &quot;Best Jazz Vocal Album&quot; at the 2002 Grammy Awards. The first 11 tracks were recorded live at the Paris Olympia in 2001 and the last track &quot;Just The Way You Are,&quot; was recorded in New York City.<br /><br />What made this live recording so special to me is the inclusion of an all-time favorite song penned by Bart Howard, &quot;Fly Me To The Moon.&quot; Diana Krall gives it a gorgeous treatment that is best possible for a live recording with the support of Anthony Wilson on guitar, John Clayton on bass and Jeff Hamilton on drums.<br /><br />&quot;Fly me to the moon<br />And let me play among the stars<br />Let me see what Spring is like<br />On Jupiter and Mars<br />In other words, hold my hand<br />In other words, Darling kiss me<br />Fill my heart with song<br />And let me sing forevermore&quot;<br /><br />Most of her hit songs from various albums are performed in the liveliest settings. You'll surely appreciate and enjoy &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; &quot;'S Wonderful,&quot; &quot;East of the Sun (And West of the Moon&quot;) and Billy Joel's greatest song &quot;Just The Way You Are,&quot; a song I love when it was a number one hit . . . many moons ago? And not to mention a tear-jerker of all-time, &quot;Maybe You'll Be There,&quot; the song responsible for the expressive eyes that cried a river, and the song that produced an ocean of tears.<br /><br />Two of my highlights, &quot;Let's Fall In Love&quot; and &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; features Alan Broadbent as music director/conductor with Orchestre Symphonique European.<br /><br />This CD, which Diana Krall dedicates to her mother, is a testament that she is equally good at live recording with her enigmatic stage presence and a great rapport with live audience. Kudos to all her fine musicians who helped make this one of the most outstanding jazz live recordings.<br /><br />This is a fabulous listen and I wholeheartedly recommend it.anding jazz live recordings.<br /><br />This is a fabulous listen and I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|A soundtrack written as a story, this is fine, inspiring, captivating music--it completes the movie. Sean Penn (*screenwriter and director of Into the Wild) succeeded in finding the singer/songwriter for this project but you probably know all these details, let's get to the music and voice of Eddie Vedder! There are only two songs on the CD which he didn't write. Both of those are phenomenal as well.     Setting Forth -- 9/10   No Ceiling -- 10/10 -- \\"I leave here believing/more than I had/This love has got/no ceiling...I leave here believing/more than I had/And there's a reason I'll be/Reason I'll be back\\"  Far Behind -- 9/10 -- \\"Why sleep in discontent?/Oh the price of companionship/empty pockets will/allow a greater/sense of wealth...subtle voices in the wind/hear the truth they're telling/a world begins where the road ends/watch me leave it all behind\\"  Rise -- 9/10  Long Nights -- sparse song/gorgeous baritone vocals/guitar -- 9/10  Tuolomne -- guitar instrumental/no vocals -- 8/10  Hard Sun -- 10/10 -- \\"When I walk beside Her/I am the better man/When I look to leave Her/I always stagger back again...There's a big/a big hard sun/beating on the big people/in the big hard world...Once I stood to lose Her/When I saw what I had done/bound down and threw away the Hours/of Her garden and Her Sun.\\" -- With incredible background vocals by Corin Tucker -- this is the anthem of this album  Society -- 10/10 -- haunting melancholy tune -- \\"It's a mystery to me/we have a Greed/with which we have agreed...There's those thinking more less/Less is more/But if less is more, How you keepin' score?\\"  The Wolf -- plaintive cries with no lyrics per se -- very short, still it's catchy -- 8/10  End of the Road -- half lyrics/half instrumental, brooding, dark   Guaranteed -- signature guitar melody with lyrics, again so suited to the movie and good enough just on their own -- I will leave you some mystery to read them yourself! -- 10/10    The packaging is visually appealing with scenery shots from this film and a hardcover cardboard not plastic case. I am pleased the lyrics are included because I couldn't focus on the lyrics much during the film even though the music added a lot to the picture as a whole.    Highly Recommended
B00007LTIL|5.0|I have owned this on vinyl, cassette and now on CD. I just love this album. Box of Rain is a perfect song for the era and the whole thing just feels kind of peaceful. Great for anyone who is new to the Dead or a fan from long ago. What a long strange trip it's been.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|This movie has a good storyline, the plot follows well.  Unfortunately the acting by Danny Glover and Mark Wahlberg does not follow through.  Mark Wahlberg was my favorite actor when he did Boogie Nights.  I thought that was a fantastic performance.  Unfortunately, when he plays tough guys roles, it doesn't follow through.  It comes across as fake.  He is better suited to playing roles like in Boogie Nights and not that of a professionally trained killer.  Glover does a bad job of playing a bad guy.  Really poor.  It is a shame because he is very charismatic in Lethal Weapon.      I thought the movie was really well done otherwise.  The scene where he was trapped and surrounded by 24 mercenaries on all sides and closing in quickly was exciting.  The story kept unfolding new angles and couldn't wait to see how it all ended.  The special effects were good.  Had they had more believable actors, I would have given this movie 5 stars.
0440238609|5.0|These books are absolutely fantastic for people of all ages. I started reading the first one in 1995 (when I was 10 years old) and loved it. Years later I stumbled on the sequels which I hadn't even known existed. They make you think, which for some people, is a good thing. Its refreshing to read fantasy novels where good and evil are sometimes ambiguous.     To those who \\"fear\\" the message that their kids are getting: Its ironic that the same people who claim they are against brainwashing are those that want to censor and control what ideas children are exposed to. Whatever your views, let your kids read it and have a conversation about it afterwards. What is there to hide? Its fiction.

B0000214F0|2.0|I remember going to the cinema in the early 1970s to see \\"Caligula\\".I must have come away with some positive feelings about the movie then.Ah,how the passage of time can make us see things in a different light.This movie is mostly pretty disgusting.Some scenes had me reaching for the remote.There is little of history and much sensationalism here.Malcolm McDowell does his very naughty boy act to a tee.Not much can be said for John Gielgud and Helen Mirren who made bad career decisions by agreeing to be in this sordid little lot.My advice to the potential viewer: get hold of a book about Caligula and find out what really happened.If you must watch the movie,don't do it before or after meals.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|I stayed up all night to finish up the season. The ending is a little abrupt and there's a teaser for what would have been Season 4. I've read reviews that said that the third season wasn't as interesting as Seasons 1 & 2, but it was. It was a darker season with a lot more angst in Veronica's private life, but part of that comes from having gotten to know the characters better. All in all, I'm looking forward to watching the whole season again!
B000UR366S|5.0|A friend in high school was a huge Joni Mitchell fan.  She lobbied for and succeeded in having \\"Carousel\\" named our class song in 1977.

B0000028RR|4.0|An album from the early 90s that sounds so similar to what we have today is revolutionary. Rage paved the way for many of these garbage bands we have today that sing about lying in bed and running away from some girl that broke their heart. But these new bands have mucked it all up and forgot to sing about what is relevant in our nation and the world. Rage may use profanity a lot, but they have to get their point across somehow, or else no one would listen to them. Listen to this cd with an understanding of our country and what its done before you question and expel it. This is the first bombtrack Rage fans!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|one of the best cd`s I think Garth Brooks has evey done the old stuff but most of all the new song more than a memory could be the best yet
B000WTNCQS|5.0|So, i just wanted to throw this out there. Among the extra tracks there's a single edit of \\"Streets\\". Fair enough but it's not as if it's a 10 minute song edited to 3 minutes like \\"Light My Fire\\" or something. If my memory serves me well \\"Hallelujah (Here She Comes)\\" is the b-side to \\"With or Without You\\". I have it on 45. It's worth the inclusion AND Billy Preston played the organ on it! Also, are there no completely or sort of different versions of any of the tunes on the original release? That might be pretty interesting.....Ah....  I'm getting this anyway so i'm not really complaining....Killer album indeed. I hold my vinyl copy up to the light and can see my hand thru it. Is the original made on a dark brown \\"clear\\" vinyl?   All in all, one of my favorite albums ever.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I was able to view this film in a prescreening a few weeks before it was released in theaters.  Unfortunately it did not receive a whole lot of attention, and had a fairly short theatrical run.  But I'm hoping it will do well on DVD.<br /><br />This is the true story of William Wilburforce, the man who stood alone in the English Parliament, working tirelessly to end the terrible slave trade in England.  It is an uplifting film, dramatically demonstrating how one man with a few loyal supporters can win the hearts of a nation and change the world.<br /><br />The message of Christ rings clear and true throughout the film, never descending to syrupy sentimentalism or beating the viewer over the head with preachy dialog.  One feels the moral conviction that drove Wilburforce to put his faith into action instead of being content to sit on the side and gaze and spiderwebs.<br /><br />I watched the film again this weekend after buying it on DVD.  And I was struck with the relevance it bears, especially this year.  With upcoming elections in the United States, many are tempted to look for \\"electablility\\" first and principle second.  We would do well to learn from William Wilburforce.  He was one man fighting the representatives of an entire nation for what he knew was right.<br /><br />I don't want to get too political here, but this is a political film in a political world.  To me, Ron Paul is a modern American Wilburforce.  He is one man standing for right in a Congress full of men molded by the establishment, just as Wilburforce stood against the whole of Parliament when slavery was accepted as the status quo.  They said Wilburforce was crazy.  An idealist whose morals could never work practically in the real world.<br /><br />So this next year I'll be voting for Ron Paul for President of the United States.
B000J10EQU|1.0|This movie is a $ rip-off on the original Superman films. From the opening scene, the movie is unrealistic, the acting terrible and the characters are lifeless. Gene Hackman was a MUCH better Lex than this guy. Reeves was also a much better Superman than this forgettable acter (whom I don't know the name of and really don't care). The soundtrack is EXACTLY the same as the original film...I guess whomever produced the film either has no creativity at all to make a new sound track or was just trying to save $. If you saw and loved the 1978 film you will hate this movie. To be honest, I turned it off about 1/2 way though (after that ridiculous scene where the airplane almost crashes into the stadium and everyone starts clapping) and tried to forget I ever saw it. This movie proves ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH TODAYS MOVIES. All fluff and no substance, realism or creativity. Don't waste your time with this.
B000002H2H|5.0|RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.      When Metallica recorded their debut, [[ASIN:B000002H5E Kill 'Em All]], the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM (\\"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\\") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think [[ASIN:B000001F7R On Through the Night]], their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..    Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING, [[ASIN:B000002H33 Master of Puppets]], and [[ASIN:B000002H6C ...And Justice For All]] sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.    As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record.All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.      \\"Fire with Fire\\": The soft intro to \\"Battery\\" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, \\"Fire for Fire\\".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.    \\"Ride the Lightening\\" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.      \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.    \\"Fade to Black\\" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a \\"suicide classic\\".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.    \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to \\"Escape.\\"  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.    \\"Escape\\" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is true that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.         \\"Creeping Death\\", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.    And last, but definitely not least, is \\"The Call of Ktula\\".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song \\"Hanger 18\\". Discounting the two covers \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and \\"Mercyful Fate\\" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental \\"Orion\\".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.    Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they wouldfollow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for \\"Escape\\", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of \\"Escape\\".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will long be remembered as the first hugely acclaimed mainstream movie dealing with a same-sex love story. It is not surprising, it's rather logical and natural, that the original short story was written by a woman, Annie Proulx. Her female viewpoint on the world shows very clearly in both main male characters. Therefore, while the plot line may be implausible and far-fetched for a lot of viewers personally, the film is made with excellent craft and deeply human overtones, which make it more believable and psychologically real. Ang Lee's directing of big emotions (Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and his work with actors is just peerless (Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of amazing). Not to mention the beautiful Wyoming scenery. The film drags a little bit in the second half, but overall is one of the most original movies to emerge in a rather poor crop of the industry post the year 2000.

B0007Y08QA|4.0|I really loved this movie. It has so many unique aspects to it. I don't want to repeat what all the other reviews have already said, so I'll just say that after I watched this movie the first time, I watched the special features  (bonus material) and then I watched the movie again but with the Director's commentary activated. There is  so much more  you pick up on that way. Its an intriguing story with an interesting outcome.  I watched this movie just after having seen \\"The Number 23\\" (with Jim Carrey) and I thought there were some  interesting parallels between the two stories. Granted, the two stories aren't overly similar, but there definitely  are parallels and similarilties.  I'd definitely recommend this movie, but like I said, watch it first, then the bonus materials, then watch it  again with the director's commentary. There are some interesting subtleties that you learn about through  the Director's commentary  that you might not even notice otherwise.
1594200823|5.0|This is an excellent book...Michael Pollen is witty and easy to read.   He makes some excellent points and comparissons in this book that really convey the effects (environmental, economic, social, ect) of our food choices.  These types of things tend to be eye-opening and somewhat depressing, but he finds a way to also be inspiring.  Great fodder for lively discussions!
B000LC3ID8|3.0|The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the saw3 (I haven't seen 4 yet) so saw2 got 5 stars, saw3 gets only 3 stars.     Traps in 3 include: a) Angel trap (my fav) - metal parts stitched to the ribs so when the wings open, its bye bye ribs. Everything comes flying apart. Basically you end up missing your whole torso. 2) pig mincer 3) body wrencher - neck, legs, and arms are wrenched 360 degree to provide some cool and inventive death/torture 4) big freeze 5) head detonation. (they actually show you the stump that gets left behind eeeeks !!!!)  SFX guys you rock in this movie. This movie is all about the FX. The pigs were artifically made so that they cud be thrown in the pig mincer/juicer scene. watch the fx commentary on the extras in the \\"traps section\\"    Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the \\"the traps of Jigsaw\\" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary. There is a \\"making of\\". You'll be find renting this one beter off. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.     This one is not as psychological as 2. This is more in your face blood and guts. Its all about ribs flying apart, intestines comming out, bones being broken and heads being blow apart. Pls be warned this one is the most most grossest of the whole series. I mean it. Walk away from this movie if this kind of stuff gives you insomnia or nightmares.    Just watch the movie for what it is. If youare squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened.     Saw 3 is a total epsiode continuation of saw2. The characters start basically where they left off in 2. So if you don't see saw2 before seeing this one, you won't be able to make sense of the movie flow and login as there are a lot of flash backs to saw 2 . The set from saw 1 refuses to go away. The cut ankle is still lying there in that toilet and those ppl are still there with their decomposing bodies. \\"Ohh yes there will be blood\\" he said. And you know what, 3 doesn't delievers blood alone, it just spills out ribs, guts and flesh. Satisfaction gauranteed.     regards, Vikram

B000002MFE|5.0|Who knew? Eric Clapton Unplugged (1992) was just going to be a treat for Clapton fans, and a chance to see and hear one of history's greatest guitarists show his stuff on an acoustic guitar. But Clapton and Unplugged made history by winning six Grammy Awards including Album Of The Year, Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and Best Rock Song (Layla). It turned out to be MTV's proudest moment and grandest achievement.<br /><br />There's a lot to like on Unplugged including this cool laid-back version of Layla. It loses none of it's purpose, and has a great guitar solo and features some nice piano work from Chuck Leavell.<br /><br />The deep and personal Tears In Heaven won three of those Grammy Awards, and the fact that Eric managed to bravely perform the song he wrote about his son, Conor, who had recently died, speaks volumes.<br /><br />The acoustic blues songs, Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out, Before You Accuse Me, San Francisco Bay Blues and Robert Johnson's Walkin' Blues and Malted Milk, all sound great, too.<br /><br />Two huge standouts on the album are Old Love and Running On Faith. They are personal, soulful and include inspired vocal perfomances, fine acoustic guitar work, and excellent slide guitar. Both songs stand with E.C.'s best work.<br /><br />Unplugged is really more of a perfect storm, where circumstances came together and fell into place, than a great work of art, but it's still a fine example of how talent, tragedy, and triumph can form an inspiring and wonderful creation. Eric Clapton Unplugged isn't perfect, but it's close.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|It is incomprehensible to me that this exquisite evocation of such a deeply familiar and shockingly strange era is not yet available on DVD. Of the few shows that rise above the level of entertainment to attain something more permanent and profound, fewer still fail to lose anything significant on repeat viewings. And to be one of the fewest of the few and not be available on DVD? What? And while we're at it, AMC? Really?
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Ever think a film, made into a musical, made into a film again would be a good thing? That's exactly what happened to John Waters' \\"Hairspray\\", one of his most conventional movies made (if a John Waters movie could ever be considered conventional!). Taking his marvelous mid-eighties movie, it was adapted into a spunky, fun Broadway musical, which in turn, would naturally move back to the screen in 2007. The results? A high-spirited romp of cinematic fun that makes it impossible to sit and not tap your toes.<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad, hefty teenager with a yen for dancing, longs to be a council member on Baltimore's \\"Corny Collins\\" show. Tracy is the heroine of today: polished, joyful, and unabashedly herself. Tracy tries out for the show, but is rebuffed by stodgy henmother Velma, who only looks out for bratty beautiful daughter Amber. Tracy is undeterred, fenagling her way on to the show via moves she learned from resident detention student Seaweed, who had a thing for Penny, Tracy's friend. All the while, Tracy's mother, Edna, lives at home and tries to protect her only offspring from the world, unsuccessfully, eventually \\"coming out\\" herself. Throw in a magnificent civil rights story line, and you get the world of Hairspray.<br /><br />What amazes about this film is the sheer energy that director Adam Shankman injects into this cinematic riot. It literally is impossible not to tap the toes, and I daresay, had it been possible, I would have been up in the theater aisles trying to move like these pulsating kids. Every scene is alive. Shankman has said that this whole film is imagined through the eyes of innocent Tracy, who walks around hearing music in her head all day long. It pays off. The dancing is THE best in recent film, and is only matched by the stellar performances.<br /><br />To be honest, when I first heard John Travolta was Edna, I thought \\"Eesh\\". Two seconds into watching his performance, I thought, \\"Wow\\". He not only steals Edna from the impressive Harvey Fierstein, but reinvents her into a shy, emerging violet of a woman. When she dances in the finale, you are so with her, err him, that her dance of joy makes you joyful. Queen Latifah gives Motormouth Maybell a sense of dignity and pride. And it's Nikki Blonsky's Tracy, who is the center of this film, who is so obviously in love with music, dancing, and herself, that makes her an incredible protagonist.<br /><br />Hairspray is ultimately about the joy of finally doing the right thing. When the cast sings \\"You Can't Stop the Beat\\", it's about the tide of the Civil Rights movement affecting one small thing in a great universe. But it's also about people accepting each other. And it's about how the world, no matter how hard you try, will always spin on.vents her into a shy, emerging violet of a woman.

1401207138|5.0|This hardcover boxed set is worthy of the Absolute title. Paper quality is superb, excelent hardcover work and after the 12 chapters there is a collection of texts and drawings by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, all telling about the first ideas that generated Watchmen.<br />This edition is recommended to all readers, the new ones and even old fans. This is a book to pass along to the following generations.<br />I won't spend too much time talking about the history itself: it's the best coomic book EVER, full stop.

I think he was just way too confident, and extremely attracted to the untethered life of hitch-hiking and living off the land.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I recently watched the new Blu-Ray copy I purchased of \\"Casino Royale\\" - it blew me away.  You MUST view it this way.  The opening credit sequence with the playing card theme was unbelievable from a color and sharpness point of view.  Bright bright reds and deep dark blacks that you do not normally see on standard DVD copies.  The picture was so sharp and detailed that I had forgotten how good it looked the first time in the theatre.    Well worth the cost of going Blu-Ray!
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I first saw this film in Japanese at a Sci-fi/Fantasy convention in the early 1990's. I couldn't understand a word, there were no subtitles, but I was completely mesmerized.  The imagination behind this film is incredible.  Epic in scale, it seems to belong to something far bigger than the already vast landscape you see on the screen.  Even without the dialog, I understood enough of the story through the visuals alone that it swept me along right up until the near-catastrophic ending.<br /><br />Now I have the DVD.  I still prefer to watch it in Japanese because the English voice-overs don't get the characters quite right.  I like Miyazaki's brand of feminism, where the female lead is strong not in spite of her female sensitivities, but because of them.  Her strength comes from kindness, compassion, self-sacrificing, curiosity, and a quiet courage that allows her to give in when giving in is best for others.  Although it is cool to hear Patrick Stewart as Lord Yoppa, I felt that the girl who voiced Nausicaa didn't quite get it.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other Disney DVD releases of Miyazaki's films, this one includes a documentary about the making of the film.  It isn't as snappy as some making-of documentaries I've seen, but I found it very informative.<br /><br />I do think that whoever decided to put Nausicaa in tight, nearly skin colored leggings made a poor style choice.  That disturbed me for the first several minutes until I realized she actually was wearing pants (whew!).<br /><br />This film contains some violence and frightening images (besides the leggings) but should be fine for children over 10.
B00005JLCI|5.0|When this movie was released in 1996 it was a feast for the eyes.  Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations are usually delightful and Hamlet is no exception.  Rather than set in medieval Denmark, he brings the setting to Victorian times, complete with muskets and a train.  Visually this film is hard to beat as the interiors of Elsinore--while built on a sound stage--are stunning.  The depth of the original play is not lost in this version, and the all-star cameo cast (including Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Charlton Heston and Robin Williams) is a pleasure beside the main cast of Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Richard Briers and Branagh himself.      Ignore the Mel Gibson version of Hamlet and watch this one instead; you will see the difference immediately.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Nothing to say here, but what's alredy stated. I'm just extremely grateful to be enjoying this movie the way it was always mean't to be enjoyed. Richard Lester is the most under-rated director of all time.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|The problem with the US and the UK is that we still have different mindsets -- from current events to physical and emotional displays.  Torchwood is one of the most daring shows I've seen to date.  The storylines show innovation and feeling; no character's gender or personal attraction is singled out because of whom they interact with, whether physical or not.  The Torchwood staff is unique team of real people who happen to have the means to protect the planet.    While it was marketed as a spin-off from the [incredible] new Doctor Who series, this first season of Torchwood has certainly proven itself on its own with original characters realistically created.  The show depicts a world in which exists newfound frivolity and homosexuality to losing new interests and old loved ones.  Now that's real life, folks...why have we still not gotten used to it?
B000002UAU|5.0|To me, this is definitely the most 'sing-along' Beatles album (and everyone knows the words), but musically, they had better things in their catalog. I, for one, find a lack of coherency in the song transition here, and I really don't think this worked as a 'concept album' either. However, given its now legendary status and since it tops virtually every 'Greatest Albums Ever' List in existence, its hard to ignore the TIMELESSNESS of this album, because its more than 40 years and it still gets played at new venues and homes every single day.<br /><br />You already know that theres not a weak track to be found here. My personal favorites are the more playful numbers such as \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"Getting Better\\". Every track is a classic, but whats really interesting is that there is virtually no coherency to the lyrics, nor any intellectualism behind any of these tracks. People tend to find 'deeper meaning' on all Beatles albums, but I like to just have fun with them. On the lighter moments here, this album soars.<br /><br />The closer, \\"A Day in the Life\\" is supposed to be played on vinyl LP, in my opinion. My dad used to play this and it used to skip the last vocal notes interminably, which I found fascinating at the age of seven. On CD, this effect is obviously lost, and much of the charm was lost for me. Its associative, but still. Special mention must be made of the India-influenced \\"Within You, Without You\\". I guess we should all thank George Harrison for that one.<br /><br />Any music fan needs to have this in their collection. It wasn't the Beatles at their best, but its certainly one of their most listenable albums as there is a lot of musical diversity. Ignore the hype and don't read too many reviews - judge the music on its' own merits alone, and you'll find new things to discover about it each time you listen to it.
0743298039|5.0|The language in this book is just so beautiful.  The characters constantly state the importance of words, so true.  For those who crtisize the author's comparison to 19th century English authors, I disagree.  Vivid imagery, splendid character development.  I could not put it down.  An absolute pleasure!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Another great album from Alter Bridge, they're definitly my favourite band right now. Fantastic combination of heavy melodic tracks with 3 brilliant slower tracks. Myles vocals just get better and with him now playing more guitar it adds a different dimension. He's got to be one of the best rock singers out there right now. Mark Tremonti is at his best with some great guitar work and Brian and Flip just add the icing to the cake on an album which easily lives up to One Day Remains. I'm struggling to name a favourite track as they're all amazing! If you like great rock 'n roll music then Alter Bridge are the band for you. Superb live as well !!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The story of William Wilberforce will capture your heart as will the need to never let slavery exist again.  There are links to several websites dealing with current \\"slavery\\" issues off the movie's website, and, hopefully, the viewer will be motivated to go there and become more aware of the problems we still face.  The acting is this movie is superb. Some of Britain's finest take center stage in this production.  This is a family friendly and Christian friendly film.

I picked up this book hoping for the entertaining and enlightening event that most of the other reviewers had found. Instead, all I got after slogging through nearly eighty pages of Kerouac's rambling and grammatically nightmarish prose, was a headache and the gnawing sensation that I'd been conned.    In all honesty, I don't \\"get\\" it. Why all the fuss? While I understand the historical significance of Kerouac and this book (along with \\"On The Road\\") to the counter-culture \\"Beat\\" movement of the fifties, it simply didn't connect.     The snippets of \\"Zen\\" wisdom were very rudimentary and the plot was non-existent. But it was the meandering writing style that made this book an absolutely miserable experience for me.     Perhaps when this book was first published it was a revolutionary piece of literature. Maybe it inspired a whole generation of repressed \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" Americans to hop a boxcar and explore the world while exploring their own identities. But it just seemed crude and archaic to me.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These headphones are extremely comfterable after hours of use, even if you wear glasses like I do. After watching movies for 5 hours, I forget I even have them on.<br /><br />Another big thing I was worried about with the semi-open design was that it might leak out to much sound, and be annoying to my roomates. In a small, quiet room, if I turn them up really loud, my roomates can hear them a little. But with \\"normal\\" listening volume, they did not hear anything! This is great for people who don't want to disturb anyone.<br /><br />The sound is realy something you fall in love with the more you listen to them. The quality is so clear, I can now hear parts of songs I never knew exsisted! Listening to orchastrel pieces, it really comes alive as I can now hear every finite detail of complecated pieces. Intially I thought the bass was lacking, but I find it is actually just more true to what it really sounds like. I actually find using a flat EQ produces the best sound, but if you like more bass, just change your EQ to bassbosster and it will provide very clear, strong bass.<br /><br />They only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because when I first got them the left side wasn't working. I played around with it a little, and it started to work again, but I'm afraid it could be a problem in the future. So far this has not been the case, but many people seem to have this problem, so I would use care with the phones.<br />Overall they are the perfect headphone, and highly recomended.
B00004HYLF|4.0|Let me start off by saying this disc offers up some fantastic progressive jazz/rock music! Chick Corea (keyboards) led this group of Al Di Meola (guitar), Stanly Clark (bass) and Lenny White (drums) thru the Midieval World of 1976 as jazz/rock juggernauts. The sound was what Emerson, Lake and Palmer might have sounded like if they based their music on jazz instead of classical. Equally as talented, Chick and company tear it up on these six tunes. Sometimes Chick's keyboard sounded like an electronic child's piano which made me think that one day this music could end up being used as the background for kid's cartoons the way classical is served up now...Sponge Bob, Jazz pants anyone? Oh well, I ve really gone off now! Sorry. I first heard this music back in the late seventies and it may have been a bit over my head at the time. Now that my ears have grown up a little, I can appreciate the flatout screaming blue talent oozing from each of these guys and hey, Lenny White friggin rocks man! On Romantic Warrior Stanley Clark makes good use of the bow on a standup bass and don't even get me started on Al Di Meola. He was 21 at the time and could out play most guitarist of the day. I could listen to him pick all day. Just keep feeding him sandwiches and don't let him stop, please. This is top drawer jazz fusion with good rock roots. Caution: these guys play pretty fast. Don't let the corny song tiles scare ya, it was the seventies, man! - Ciao
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|I never heard this collection until years after its release--but what a pleasent surprise. From what I gather this was Clark's attempt to break through as a major performing artist, that for obsure reasons was not adequately promoted by the label. Sales were disappointing and it ended up being one of the best albums no one ever heard. Every track is a superior effort---including the re-recording of \\"The Train Leaves Here this Morning\\", which has got to be one of my all-time Clark favorites. Other standouts in a collection of standouts are \\"Silver Raven\\", and \\"The Strength of Strings'. An interesting performer and songwriter from his days with the Byrds until his untimely death in the early nineties, this is one that shouldn't be missed.
B0000067L2|5.0|Sunshine of Your Love played all day long on the radio when I was a freshman in high school. We still could not get enough of the best song ever written in the history of mankind and the universe as we knew it. I remember pounding out the drum parts on the bottom of my desk (good sonic qualities) in history class. This whole album brings back such great memories of my youth. It is filled with good music from the British lads who helped define the phsycadelic(sic) sound. Why were the British so darned talented? Anyway, I highly recommend this album for good old rock and roll lovers and of course, fellow geezers. - Ciao

075640407X|5.0|With its engaging protagonist and fresh, original take on an old plot, this is a most accesible and exceeding enjoyable, fantasy adventure.<br /><br />It is the story of red haired Kvothe.  His tales of heroism, feats of sorcery and amazing adventures preceed him.  Now he has \\"retired\\" from the service and lives a life of almost mundane reptition.  A good life yes, but a quiet one.  That is until the Chronicler turns up on his doorstep, seeking to make the fiction fact.<br /><br />And so the story begins - over three nights the truth behind the hero Kvothe will be revealed.  This is the first night.<br /><br />But what a life it has been!  Despite his quick-wit, barbed tongue and many talents, Kvothe has had rather a struggle through life.  From the nomadic life of a travelling bard to the harsh life of a street urchin, and finally into the vast halls of the University.<br /><br />Comparing this book with Harry Potter would be doing it a vast disservice, but the comparisons are there.  It is as though the author has extracted all the best qualities of our Boy Wizard adventures and transformed them into this masterpiece of a fantasy novel.  Rothfuss has taken a far more scientific, mature approach to magic, and it is clear that he has a background in chemistry and phyiscs.  And whereas our Boy Wizard (Harry) had his whole wizardry training handed to him on a gilded platter, money and all, Kvothe has to struggle - first for acceptance and then for the entry fees.  All up, this is like the grim and gritty reality behind the flowery fantasies.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed both realistically and convincingly.  Most of us will either recognise a little of Kvothe in ourselves, or in our male friends!<br /><br />I must say, I really admire Rothfuss's technique for gathering Advance Critique - the back cover of this novel reads like a \\"famous faces in fantasy\\".  I would imagine that he sent advance copies to all his favourite authors, and a jolly good idea that was too!  He is reviewed on Amazon by Robin Hobb.  Which I think, all up, says it all.<br /><br />Read this book - even if you think you hate fantasy - I guarantee you'll enjoy it!Hobb.  Which I think, all up, says it all.    Read this book - even if you think you hate fantasy - I guarantee you'll enjoy it!
0709082819|4.0|Although I do not feel this book is as  well done as is Grange's Mr. Darcy's Diary, I was pleased  someone wrote from Captain Wentworth's point of view. We know so little about his life those years away from Anne Elliott; it is nice to have someone try to fill in the blanks for us Jane Austen fans. Grange makes a living out of these types of pieces, and she has mastered the formula for writing them. She has those by Darcy, Wentworth, Bertram, Knightley, etc. - all of Jane Austen's leading men.
0345457684|5.0|As the quote on the book's cover states, this book is \\"ferociosly readable\\". Once started, the book was not put down until the end. The universe created by Richard Morgan is both well detailed and not too farfetched, to keep readers involved and interested in the story. I felt that the ending was somewhat rushed and over-simplified, but that did not take away from the overall enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Strongly suggest to all lovers of sci-fi genre.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|Yes, the sound is superior, and we get the Celebration day solo as it was originally played, but some of the songs are EDITED, and the edits are glaring, like Black Dog, and the Whole Lotta Love crunge section is GONE! You get two seconds of it. I cannot listen to Black Dog anymore, and Whole Lotta Love will be replaced by the old version on my IPOD. A dissapointment for this long-time fan who was anxiously awaiting this release.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|We should be deeply grateful to EMI and Maestro Barenboim for providing us with this treasure. The inclusion of the masterclasses are valuable not only in terms of performance but also and especially because of the profound insights into the music Barenboim provides in the course of his critiques. These insights are nothing short of a basic philosophy of Beethoven and of life. One is left with the impression that playing and studying Beethoven his whole life had the effect of helping make Barenboim the person is today. Through Beethoven's music Barenboim is an artist who helps us feel this great poet's insights into himself and human nature and does so in a way that is most affecting.  My suggestion would be to go to the masterclasses first and then listen to Barenboim's performances after. The performances themselves are exciting, passionate and persuasive. It is impossible not be in awe of the intelligence and humanity of Beethoven as realised by Maestro Barenboim.
0060849827|3.0|I like the book; it has VERY useful, detailed, information for anyone in a \\"survival\\" situation.  However, it is 385 pages in a quite small book (approx 1\\"x3\\"x5\\"), and printed in VERY small font.  The book size makes makes it nicely packable.

B000UR9TQE|5.0|I would like to share something that may help you understand and appreciate this film even more.  First, please understand that I am a huge Zeppelin fan.  I never got to see the band in concert but I own all of their albums (in LP and CD form) and listen to them often.  I received the new DVD about a week ago.  I had not seen this movie before so the first time I watched it, I was a little confused about the various non-concert segments.  I found a short but effective explanation of the band's \\"fantasy sequences,\\" which I have copied below.  Now that I understand what the band members were trying to achieve, I appreciate the film more.  Personally, I would not have included the clips about the money being stolen or the rude scene where Peter Grant cusses out the MSG guys (about some counterfeit posters) BUT I would not let these small things keep you from enjoying the most important part of the film, which are the music and the performances.    There are dozens of incredible solos throughout the film but I would like to point out one in particular that blew me away and is very easy to miss.  It is Jimmy's guitar work in No Quarter.  This is the song that contains John Paul's fantasy sequence.  This particular solo comes in the middle of that sequence so you don't SEE Jimmy playing it; you have to listen for it.      Anyway, I hope this helps.  The older I get the more I appreciate the great music we got during the early 70's.  I feel fortunate to have lived during those great years.  I also appreciate the fact that we can still enjoy these amazing performances more than 30 years later.  Rock on.    ABOUT THE FANATSY SEQUENCES    With an intention to give an insight into the individual personalities in the band, several out-of-concert 'fantasy sequences' were shot by Massot for each of the band members, in addition to Peter Grant and tour manager Richard Cole. The sequences are as follows:    Peter Grant (left) and Richard Cole Massot originally shot Grant walking acameraman around a collection of antique cars, but this footage was quickly abandoned. Instead, Grant and Cole were filmed as hitmen driving towards Hammerwood Park estate in Sussex in a 1928 Pierce-Arrow car. Roy Harper also makes an uncredited guest appearance as one of the 'greedy millionaires' portrayed at a business meeting of multi-national corporations. Massot envisioned Grant and Cole in the hitman roles, as it symbolised the tough business decisions they made on behalf of the band. The female passenger wearing a scarf with Peter Grant driving on a country road is his wife, Gloria.     John Paul Jones was filmed first at home with his wife Mo, and reading Jack and the Beanstalk to his two daughters, Tamara and Jacinda, before receiving a call to join the band on their American concert. For his fantasy sequence, Jones initially wished to use footage from the original Doctor Syn film, but was prevented from doing so as this film was owned by Disney. Instead, his fantasy sequence involved a reinterpretation of the film. Jones portrays a masked gentleman known as \\"The Scarecrow,\\" who travels at night on horseback with three others and returns home to Sussex, an ordinary family man. The three other horsemen with him are a reference to the other band members. Jimmy Page's girlfriend, Charlotte Martin, and baby daughter Scarlet Page can be briefly seen during the closing moments of this sequence, which was filmed in October 1973. Thematic music: \\"No Quarter\\".     In his fantasy sequence, Robert Plant was captured relaxing on his Welsh country farm with his wife Maureen, and children Karac and Carmen. His fantasy sequence involves him being a knight rescuing a fair maiden (played by Virginia Parker), who is a symbolic representation for his vision of the ideal - his personal search for the Holy Grail. Scenes from the sword fight were filmed at Raglan Castle in Wales while the sailing, horseback riding and beach scenes were shot at Aberdovey then Merionethshire and now Gwynedd, in October 1973. Thematic music: \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\".     Jimmy Page is filmed sitting by a lake next to his 18th century manor at Plumpton, Sussex, playing a hurdy gurdy. The tune played is called \\"Autumn Lake\\" and the scene was filmed in October 1973. Page's fantasy role involved climbing up the face of a snow capped mountain near Boleskine House, Loch Ness during the nights of a full moon on December 10 and 11, 1973. The act was meant to show man fighting his way to the top, only to be greeted by The Hermit on the untitled fourth album. Thematic music: \\"Dazed and Confused\\".     John Bonham was shot with his wife Pat and son Jason Bonham on their country estate, Old Hyde Farm in Worcestershire. It is interesting to note that part of his fantasy includes him spending time at home with his family. Bonham was known for falling into deep depressions while on tour away from his family. His heavy drinking, which ultimately resulted in his death, is usually attributed to his homesickness. The game of pool was shot at The Old Hyde Hotel and the Harley-Davidson riding near Blackpool. His fantasy sequence is the most straightforward of all the members, with Bonham drag racing an AA Fueler at 260mph at Santa Pod Raceway, Wellingborough, Northants, UK, in October 1973. Thematic music: \\"Moby Dick\\".     SOURCE: Wikipedia
B00005JKJA|3.0|Lynch has difficulty telling a straight story, if you pardon the pun.  I don't mind time-bending storylines (\\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Memento\\") but they have to have an underlying, live plot, as opposed to images, mood and style.  And the film was too long and too self-involved.<br /><br />What do I mean by \\"self-involved\\"? I'm tired of books about authors (\\"Wonderboys\\"), plays about stage performers (\\"Noises Off\\"), songs about musicians (\\"Faithfully\\") and most of all, films about actors.  Quit getting off on yourselves for once.  Why three stars? Because Lynch is Lynch.  Who else could give you characters like the Cowboy and the Incompetent Hitman?
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This clever little sweeper has 4 rapidly rotating brushes: front and rear plus one on each side.  The motor drives the rear brush, and since they are all mechanically linked, they all spin at once.  The low profile unit is 9.5 by 5.5 inches and it fits easily under cabinet toe spaces.  The bits of material it picks up stay trapped in the tray that is very easy to remove to empty.  The kitty hair that gets wrapped around the bristles is easy to pull off by grasping it between thumb and forefinger. (The included seam ripper/stitch cutter tool may speed up that process, but I seldom use it.)<br /><br />I have been using my Swivel Sweeper for two years and have absolutely no complaints.  I think it is one of the very best &#34;As Seen On TV&#34; products.<br />I use a timer to charge the 7.2 volt NiMH battery for seven hours to get about two or more weeks of<br />daily use per charge.  The &#34;gimble&#34; style swivel attachment to the handle make it a real pleasure to guide around the floor.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this is not a substitute for a vacuum cleaner, but I have great success using it on our light colored vinyl kitchen floor and on the adjoining family room carpet.  I am able to keep up with the fir needles and other debris tracked in by the two kitties (one 15 pound Maine Coon with BIG feet and a very long hair domestic).<br /><br />I have found this sweeper to be a real improvement over the Hokey manual carpet sweeper I used to use, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*********UPDATE********<br /><br />August 7, 2010:  Recently I thought this original type Swivel Sweeper was starting to fail on me, since it slowed down soon after a  battery charge.

At the plastic ends of all the rotary brush shafts where they are attached to the corner couplings and at the center main power coupling, I sprayed some teflon/silicone &#34;dry&#34; lubricant (several brands available at hardware and home improvement stores).

B000PUV1ZI|5.0|I am a 23 yr. old male and distinctly remember this being one of my favorite movies when I was like 7 or 8! I bought this movie about a year ago and showed it to my 5 year old little brother(I think my dad wanted grandkids b4 I could give him some) and he absolutely loves it too! keep in mind he has a short attention span, yet he sits through the whole thing. and it's a movie that I actually don't mind watching with him. The movie is obviously the live action story of Peter Pan, told through the talents of an all star cast. The visuals and effects are so amazing in this movie that no matter what age you are you wish it was real! A MUST SEE FOR ANY AGE!

As you've suspected, everything you know is wrong and this book explains in the simplest and most direct terms WHY.  It's not a get rich quick schema or even \\"inspirational\\" per se:  It's more of a primer to your financial life so that you can play with the big boys and girls.  East read, too.

The Special Edition has great extras about the making of.
B000UDJS2S|2.0|Probably a great movie for adolescents, but most adults will be bored with the action and the story.  It's always a pleasure to see Cage on the screen -- and even more of a pleasure to see the aging but loaded-with-character Sam Groom from time to time.

B000A3XY9Q|4.0|I've waited patiently for years for a possible Evil Dead trilogy box set to be released.

B000J103WA|5.0|Whether you're a long-time Cream fan (I am) or not, this is a must-see DVD.  The picture quality is demonstration-quality, and the sound backs up the picture very well.    As to the performance itself, I don't believe you can reasonably compare this to Cream's earlier body of work.  [If for no other reason than we would be looking at 2-years work vs. a few nights.]    That said, this disc began by telling me just how much we're missing in today's popular music scene.    For 3 gents in their 60's to play like this is unbelievable.  There are indeed times when Bruce looks very frail and about ready to collapse, but the music he makes sounds like it's coming from someone in his 20's.    And Clapton sounds better than he has in years (pushed a bit by his bandmates?), and Baker still makes it look easy.    A funny story: during our initial viewing, my father-in-law (never had heard of Cream) watched a few minutes, and then asked \\"why don't they show the rest of the band members\\"?     Kind of summarizes the amount of music these \\"old guys\\" still can put out.
B000WMVJ7E|5.0|Beautiful to look at; rich texture in visuals, sound and smell with well developed characters.  Hard to believe he can convey so much in so little time.

I have recommended it to many already including my two sons in film and television at Columbia College, Chicago.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Regardless of whether this covers no new ground, or not. And how can these other reviewers say that?. The band has not been the band since John Bonham died, so what do they expect? This is simply, if one can say 'simply' when referring to Led Zeppelin, a remix, a remaster, a compilation of what they have done as a band, in their prime, for everyone to love...for all time. And, by now if one is not a diehard Led Zeppelin fan, one has not been around, or is too new to identify. But, if one is a fan, then how could you not want to hear this and see it. Since I first laid eyes and ears on these guys, I was astounded! They were responsible for the term 'Heavy Metal'. They started a whole new perspective in rock history and as such you have to give this retrospective a look and a listen! I love it. And I saw them 4 times in concert and have heard every song many times since they originated. How many bands can give a person goose bumps?<br />Not many. After watching this DVD and listening to the CD's I am happy to say I still get goosebumps! I went to my first Zep concert in 1970, in Raleigh, North Carolina. I remember being transfixed and missed catching Bonzo's drumstick by 2\\" as he threw it into the crowd after the concert was over. That drumstick would still be on my wall if I had caught it! Jimmy Page is tremendous, these tracks and the DVD are catching him and the band at their best. Anybody know of anyone else who used a violin bow to create some awesome riffs?! And Bonzo is great here, he is showcased on the DVD, they ALL are. The remastering is great and it sounds awesome on Dolby Digital. I CAN tell the difference in quality and to me, that is worth every penny I spend on this set which, in the grand spectrum of things, how can you NOT? Highly recommmended!<br />UPDATE: Let me just add this. If you have quality sound equipment, be it home or auto. The CD quality here is unmatched by any previous efforts. The highs and lows are tremendously enhanced. This remastering is EXCELLENT!ing is EXCELLENT!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Absolut genial! Alle Folgen in einer wirklich tollen Verpackung, bis auf ein oder zwei Folgen mit gutem Ton. Extras sind in Ordnung, aber eigentlich gar nicht nötig. Der Preis ist kaum zu schlagen, ich habe in Deutschland zusätzlich knapp 30 Euronen Zoll und Steuern bezahlt, der Versand nach Deutschland ist auch nicht kostfrei, dennoch habe ich über 100 EUR gespart und habe eine Box, in der alle DVDs einseitig bespielt sind, das ganze platzsparend verpackt ist und wirklich nett anzusehen.    Kaufempfehlung!!!!!

B00004RF98|5.0|This movie emerges high in the rankings as musical, movie, and comedy by the American Film Institute.  And a sound choice it is for such a designation.  This movie explores the transition from silent movies to \\"talkies,\\" with a focus on Lina Lamont (brilliantly portrayed by Jean Hagen) and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, who co-directed the movie). Lamont's voice is unlistenable to.  As a tired old movie was being filmed, \\"The Jazz Singer\\" was released and the movie (retitled from \\"The Dueling Cavalier\\" to \\"The Dancing Cavalier\\") was reshot as a \\"talkie\\"  and as a musical.  Cathy Selden (portrayed by a very young Debbie Reynolds) was called in to talk and sing in place of the awfully voiced Lamont (without her knowledge until very late in the game).<br /><br />But the plot is well known.  What really makes this movie work so splendidly is, first, the cast.  Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Gene Kelly are friends and the three of them work excellently together.  For instance, the trio, \\"Good Morning,\\" just sparkles.  Jean Hagen's Second, the music.  \\"Good Morning\\" was just mentioned.  Then, there is Donald O'Connor's turn in \\"Make `em Laugh.\\"  Of course, there is Gene Kelly in \\"Singing in the Rain.\\"  Third, the dancing.  I am still amazed at what Kelly can do as he sings--and dances--in the rain.  O'Connor's footwork in \\"Make `em Laugh\\" is nicely done, too.  Toward the end, \\"Gotta Dance\\" also generates energy and interest.  Cyd Charisse adds some compelling work as well.<br /><br />The final scene is really great, as Lamont gets her comeuppance.  The movie hits the right note to close out.<br /><br />This is, indeed, a classic for the ages.  Many works of art are touted as such.  Few actually earn the designation of \\"classic.\\" And \\"Singing in the Rain\\" is one of those.

Apart from that, it is incredibly useful in multi-engine aircraft like the BE20 where you need two throttles, two prop control, and two mixture.  It's hard to fly something like a B744 since the four leavers take up so much space but still definitely worth it.

The different ending to the book is maybe more interesting than the movie but is more of a cerebral subject.  Discussing pi in a movie and implications of it would not work as well but in a book, very interesting.<br /><br />I wonder how much this book has contributed to the explosion of books analyzing pi and its history?
0618680004|1.0|I am amazed at how awful this book is.  Another reviewer stated that Dawkins should not have to memorize Scripture to be a critic of it.  I agree that he should not memorize it, but he should at least familiarize himself with concepts of original sin, and then seek to disprove the theology!  I read the book to see what all the hubub was about, and left disappointed that anyone so brilliant could write like this.    Dawkins shows not even the slightest knowledge of faith and presents every type of poor argument.  This book is pure rubbish.
0877284520|5.0|I was first drawn to this deck for the artwork alone and then only later to messing around with readings. Some people complain that this belgium print (US Games) is green and murkey compared to the brighter Switzerland print by AGM which is out of print. I think they are awesome the way they are but have to admit i've never seen the latter. But seeing as how they are out of print and cost around $200 for a used set on amazon, i won't be seeing the difference any time soon.
1592402038|3.0|This book would be difficult to read for someone who doesn't use such words. Dry, dry, dry humour. Somehow leaves you expecting more. A bit sarcastic, this book is merely a time passer at best. If only it was more present based than history lesson like. Sorry, just my opinion.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|the title says it all. This CD IS \\"MAGIC\\". I like Bruce, but have never been the rabid fan like others I know (like my brother), but this CD is one of his best. Every tune is excellent. Repeated listenings since I bought it. Gets better and better.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|I've been a semi-fan of Wilco for a while, but they never seemed to hit that emotional sweet-spot that makes you swear undying love.      Until now.      This CD showcases what happens when a band hits full maturity -- the songwriting and musicianship brim with those tasty little nuances that separate the great albums from the merely good.      Wilco has left the sonic meanderings behind and focused on fully developing each song into shiny little gems that you appreciate more with each listening.

B0000041Z3|5.0|Two things: if you are someone who pursues a lot of different recordings of all the famous symphonies, then this is one of your stops. More than likely--as a taster of different readings--you'll find it mixed. The Gramophone Guide praises the Fourth and Seventh in this set. But just about anybody, especially people who aren't that familiar with Sibelius' music, or who don't plan on getting more than one version of each, can enjoy all these performances.<br /><br />Maazel is a steady hand: he pushes for some definite lines in the music, while cutting back on the \\"will-o-wisps\\" aspect. That's not to say the playing is heavy-handed, it isn't. But the emphasis is on themes, rather than mood. Yet mood prevails, especially in the Fourth, which is appropriately mysterious and dark.<br /><br />The advantage of Maazel's way with Sibelius is that he will make it more accessible for new Sibelius listeners. So I recommend this set for these folks: if you don't yet know your Sibelius, this is for you.
0062513346|3.0|I found Paulo Coelho's The Valkyries a bit of an enigma. I suspect the author at least partly intended it to be so. In a nutshell, the author seeks to discover new aspects of his psyche, to develop new angles on his existing skills. After a consultation with his mentor, he and his wife set off for a jaunt in the Mojave Desert to find what it is that they seek. Our author is in engaged in a quest, a search for his personal Angel. The reader, I am sure, will be convinced from the start that she accompanied him throughout.<br /><br />They wander off in full sun one day, take their clothes off (for some reason) and have to be rescued by Gene, who has seen it all before. He reassures the travellers that they will find their valkyries. And they do. They turn out to be a band of leather-clad women on motorbikes, ladies who have profound mystic powers which they practise amidst their regular partying.<br /><br />I was a bit perplexed by the narrator who claimed to have trained as an engineer in one breath and then discussed the existence of the universe in terms of ancient Greek elements. I suspect that the high performance motorbikes relied on a rather more complex analysis of matter. But honing the skills of a magus apparently requires the application of ancient knowledge, no matter how wrong, whatever the context. And sure enough the revelations come flooding in and lives are duly transformed. I have just a suspicion that there is something in the observation that no matter what one does with reality, spirituality is necessarily a personal experience, its significance purely internal, even when shared with others.<br /><br />The Valkyries has all the Paulo Coelho elements. There are short scenes presented in a variety of literary shorthand. The text is suffused with magic, religiosity and self-realisation set in an earthly medium. It's a quick and easy read but ultimately a satisfying one, even for someone like myself, who cannot suspend belief long enough to share in the book's experiences.<br /><br />But Paulo Coelho is a magus and a magician of the highest order. He has sold over 90 million books and, as a writer myself, I will read more of his books in the hope that I might discover his magus touch, his waft of a wand that will reveal his secret. Even without sympathy for the detail, it's a lovely, rhythmic read.But Paulo Coelho is a magus and a magician of the highest order.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|\\"The Wicker Man\\" (1973) which is known as one of the best British horror movies and has achieved the cult status since it was released over thirty years ago, is much more than just a horror. It very creatively and successfully mixes straight crime/mystery with horror, thriller, and occult drama, throwing in the elements of musical. The story (written by Anthony Shaffer) is always interesting and the characters are well developed and memorable. Where the film succeeds entirely, it is in slow build of unbearable tension that makes its final both inevitable and unbelievable.<br /><br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" follows the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Sergeant Howie of Scotland Yard (Edward Woodward), the serious and rather humorless but decent man whom we would eventually identify with, arrives to Summersville to find the girl but the locals claim that she never existed. Soon he realizes that cheerful and smiling residents of the island, adults and children  led by their spiritual leader Lord Summersisle (Christopher Lee) are engaged in the pagan religion with the rituals that shock and disgust devoted Christian Howie. The film maintains sensual, creepy, ominous atmosphere throughout yet often makes you smile and in the end leaves you totally stunned. The cinematography is breathtaking, the songs and musical score are beautiful and take the important part in the plot. Even if you guess correctly where the movie takes you, you will be undeniably shocked and disturbed when you see where exactly it took you.<br /><br />P.S. It's been few weeks since I saw the movie but I still wonder whether the harvest on the island improves the following year.
0440241413|2.0|Although the book has some amusing parts, the biggest part of it is Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Bloomwood shopping and getting into tremendous debt.  She works for a magazine writing on finance but spends more of her time (and thoughts) on shopping or where people got their things.    The story is not particularly \\"romantic\\" or even that funny.  If you know a lot about haute couture name brands (British in this book, American in the sequel), you can follow her thoughts and shopping fairly well but quickly tire of her excuses and ignoring of her debt (to the point of making up a stalker to avoid her bank manager).    But of course, being chick lit, it all works out in the end and she's off for another adventure (pretty much more of the same) in Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.    Get it if you really need something to read but if you want good chick lit, check out the Plum series for American or Bridget Jones's Diary for British.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|Because of legalities involving the director of the film, the most that Pagey was able to do to alter this vintage concert film was to remix with Kevin Shirley, the sound for DOLBY 5.1 and DTS 5.1 and two-channel STEREO. Where this was really noticeable was in the stand-out tracks DAZED AND CONFUSED, WHOLE LOTTA LOVE, and the MOBY DICK drum solo.<br /><br />Whether it is with the guitar and bow workout in DAZED AND CONFUSED or the Theramin \\"Pit of Hell\\" in WHOLE LOTTA LOVE -- Page and Kevin Shirley have been able to add many new dimensions to the sound mix. For example, the rear channels of the 5.1 system have an added new dimensionality to the sound and the overall ambience -- the original QUADRAPHONIC 4-channel mix from 1976 just didn't have the depth of field to sound the way Page intended, using today's advanced technology.<br /><br />Even the cobbled-together 5.1 surround mix for the original DVD of TSRTS -- which was done without the supervision of audio producer extraordinaire Jimmy Page -- sounds sub-par and quite unsatisfying to my ears. This may be one of the reasons why this never got a fair shake from the group's worldwide fan base, and is largely detested by this selfsame group of people.<br /><br />THE EXTRAS ...<br /><br />The second DVD and the printed materials that have been included with this COLLECTOR'S EDITION provide some historical context -- such as the concert reviews, and the news article on the Drake Hotel robbery. Also included are invites and facsimile tickets to the films' theatrical premiere, two sets of lobby cards (one in color, the other set in b & w), a copy of the 1973 tour itinerary, and a t-shirt of unknown size -- which features the soundtrack artwork.<br /><br />DVD # 2 contains some nice extras:<br /><br />01) The remaining songs from the concert, which because of space limitations in 1976, were never included UNTIL NOW.<br /><br />02) A TV news report from Tampa, Florida USA about their sold-out show there, which broke attendance and gross gate receipts established by The BEATLES August 15, 1965 Shea Stadium concert.<br /><br />03) A nice BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant, as they ride aboard a boat on the Thames.<br /><br />04) Extensive news footage on the Drake Hotel robbery, which was never solved, to the best of my memory.<br /><br />05) A Cameron Crowe radio profile of the band. And, considering what he went on to do with his life, this is nice to have. [NOTE: Robert Plant's infamous \\"I'm a Golden God!\\" exclamation found its' way into Crowe's 2000 film ALMOST FAMOUS. This film has another Zeppelin connection. Crowe, in his 'director's cut' DVD of the film, the viewer is instructed on when to begin playing Stairway To Heaven at a certain point in a deleted scene. Crowe could not afford to pay to license the song, and it was up to the viewer to pull out their own copy of Led Zeppelin IV to reach full effect in this scene.]<br /><br />All in all, a well-deserved update to an important musical artifact of the raucous 1970's.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000UR9TQO Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains the Same (Collector's Edition)]]LES August 15, 1965 Shea Stadium concert.     03) A nice BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant, as they ride aboard a boat on the Thames.     04) Extensive news footage on the Drake Hotel robbery, which was never solved, to the best of my memory.     05) A Cameron Crowe radio profile of the band.

B000W4KT64|1.0|The one and only star rating was for Christopher Walken.     That aside, how could anyone NOT notice that what made the 1988 version great was totally missing?  -The  killer handpicked original music like Foot Stompin by the Flares, Madison Time by the Ray Bryant Combo, the Gong Gong song by the Ikettes and Shake a Tail Feather by the Five Du-Tones.... Plus the authentic choreography that went along with it?     I mean the movie's about the influence blacks had on Rock and Roll and how white parents couldn't deal with it - so how's that come across with this Chitty Chitty Bang Bang score by Marc Shaiman?    This was more like a Grease remake, complete with John Travolta trying to fill Divine's very high heels- I have bolster pillows that could have given a better performance.      Ugh. Poor John Waters.

0802130208|5.0|A classic story that makes me a bit sad to think about considering that the author died young and by his own hand.  Given American culture, that may be part of the appeal of the book to many.  By any standard, however, this is a great book, with highly memorable, vividly described characters, none more so than the central figure Ignatius, a likeable, eccentric oaf.  His part-time sidekick, Myrna Minkoff, is also a hoot, and I like it when the two of them gang up.  Although it's in many ways a timeless story, the manner of speaking of the characters is probably representative of the times (1950s?).  Given the short life of the author, the book has a bit of a tragic backdrop that affected my feelings for it, and the New Orleans setting with Katrina occuring a few years ago may now also affect my memories of it.

0345494997|3.0|I have an interest in early 20th century America and was eager to read this novel based on the love affair between influential architect Frank Lloyd Wright and his doomed mistress Mamah.  The book is well researched (being a resident of Boulder, Colorado I especially appreciated the small portion of the book that takes place there and the accurate historical detail the author provides) though obviously is fiction based on fact. Mamah should be a sympathetic character but somehow she simply came out as shallow, selfish and silly to me despite her intellect and free thinking ways.  The book is well written and I can't quite define why it and its characters didn't capture my imagination more.

B00006M183|4.0|Right, so in the mid-to-late 90's Pearl Jam sucked out loud (then again, so did everyone but that little band British band you may have heard of, Radiohead or whatever their name is, they've made a couple nice albums. That band whose name involves squishing orange gourds used for Halloween is pretty good, too). So what? Riot Act is their comeback album, you know? After years of being bad, this is them finally finding themselves again and rocking out. No stupid experimentation, very few stupid ballads, just a lotta rock. The kind of stuff they should've been doing in the mid-'90s in the first place if they weren't so focused on weird stuff like \\"Hummus\\". But hey, \\"Cropduster\\", \\"Ghost\\", \\"Get Right\\" and \\"Save You\\" are simply classic Pearl Jam rockers that make the mid-'90s stew worth suffering through. Plus there's an anti-Bush song!! That's right, \\"Bushleaguer\\" is a hilarious rockin' protest against our fearless leader. Of course, I'd praise any anti-Bush song, especially if it's as good as this one, and especially if it has a line as funny as \\"The haves have not a clue\\"! I don't think it's as good as the single \\"I Am Mine\\", though, which has what just may be the best guitar playing in Pearl Jam history. I do have a few gripes to make. Yes, this is little more than a very good copy of Ten: being a classic rock revivalist band at heart, Pearl Jam never was too original. And there are a couple of low points, sadly: \\"Help, Help\\" has an awful harmony vocal that ruins the song for me; there are also a couple folk-rockers: while one (\\"Can't Keep\\") is quite good, the others (\\"Thumbing My Way\\"; \\"All Or None\\") are quite bad. And \\"1/2 Full\\" sounds like a crappy Hendrix song (There are a few of those, you know! A mere five or six, but they still exist). I give it an 8 though, because the good stuff is really good! In fact, I think this is my second favorite Pearl Jam album, behind only Dix.

B00000272N|3.0|This is the most Sabbath-esque album in AIC history. Sludge, sludge, and more sludge. In fact, what we have here is a sea of sludge. This actually proves that AIC had it all worked out right from the start: heavy riffing; slurred, creepy harmonies; depressing lyrics; loud minor chords; a general somber feel. Not for the faint of heart, in other words. People who hate metal should stay far, far away from Facelift. And even those who like it aren't advised to dive right in immediately: Dirt is a whole ton better. This does show a lot of potential in spots: the breakthrough hit \\"Man in the Box\\" hits hard, a pummeling censorship protest; my favorite, \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", is a long, churning, neo-Sabbath guitar epic; \\"We Die Young\\" is just plain scary (the lyric \\"Take another hit, and bury your brother\\" is just as disturbing as the more famous \\"What's my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?\\"); \\"Bleed the Freak\\" rocks out with cool lyrics; \\"Sunshine\\" lets a screaming guitar solo loose; \\"Real Thing\\" has excellent tempo shifts. And then there's, uh, the rest. Too much of it simply doesn't leave a mark at all (I honestly can't remember \\"I Can't Remember\\"; \\"Put You Down\\"; \\"It Ain't Like That\\"), and then there are the three flat tracks. \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" and \\"Confusion\\" are all lead-balloon attempts to remake \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" - I'm sorry, but there can only be one! And \\"I Know Somethin' ('Bout You)\\" sounds like ZZ Top. I like ZZ Top, but that's not a sound that fits AIC. Thankfully, they were quick to get rid of anything resembling sleazy blues-rock. All told, Facelift is promising, but it doesn't really live up to the potential the first four tracks create, and comes nowhere near Dirt or Jar of Flies.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Having been around to see the original theatrical version at the theater, I can honestly say it is the best. Period. The voiceover added just the right touch to fill the empty parts. And as I didn't know at the time- echoed the idea that this was a futuristic film noir. The unicorn thing is stupid- Period. Deckard is not a replicant.The whole point of the story was he was more dangerous than any replicant, and that it took a replicant for him to become a human again. The original ending is the best as well- what the hell is wrong with having an element of hope?? That is part of what makes of human. What is wrong with Deckard actually finding true love-- Just like Luca$ don't screw with the magic- because then it isn't magic anymore- Ridley Scott doesn't get to decide that Deckard is a replicant- the writers never intended that- and if he is one- why we would he get his butt handed to him throughout the whole movie??
B000025XKM|4.0|So stark, minimalist, and underproduced, it makes Plastic Ono Band look like 1984. This is what makes Nick Drake one of those artists everyone's heard of, but few have actually heard. Unless you can imagine any of this getting radio play, that is. Only one song, the album's title track, features an instrument other than his acoustic guitar - a piano. The whole here is much more than the sum of its parts. I suppose that was the idea here, since only two songs run seriously over three minutes (\\"Things Behind the Sun\\"; \\"Parasite\\"). Those two are two of my favorite songs on this album, coincidentally, though that's just because Nick is such a good lyricist, using metaphors and cooking up a stew of complex emotions (title track; \\"Which Will\\"; \\"Harvest Breed\\"). His baritone is warm, inviting, and sounds very good. This is a very good record, though it's so minimal it can wear just the slightest bit thin at times: hence, I've rated it a full star below my favorite Nick Drake album, Five Leaves Left. All three of his albums are excellent anyway.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|There's not much more critical acclaim I can add to the almost unanimous praise heaped upon Disney*Pixar's Ratatouille, so in reviewing the DVD, perhaps I can find a few things that may not have been mentioned as often.<br /><br />I am not the only person, I'm sure, who wonders whether the villain's attempts to cheapen the great chef's Gusteau's name with mass-produced convenience foods. Could this be Pixar's allusion to the proliferation of Disney animated sequels that John Lassiter curtailed?<br /><br />And was the diminutive Skinner character inspired at all by a certain former Disney executive nicknamed \\"Sparky?\\" (After all, the king in the first Shrek film was rumored to be a caricature of a certain Bazooka Joe-touting executive).<br /><br />Anyway, the film is a feast, even if the extras do not include a commentary track. Included are the shorts \\"Lifted\\" (which accompanied the feature in theaters) and the wondrously inventive new \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" sporting that great Mary Blair/Ward Kimball look that designer Nate Wragg brought to many a Pixar title sequence and story book tie-in.<br /><br />Also of note is another fine musical score from Mark Giacchino, somewhat of a departure from his Bond-like score for The Incredibles, and yet seemingly a nod to Henry Mancini, who mixed action and whimsy, often including little themes for specific sequences (most notably in the scene in which Remy and Linguine practice their \\"head control\\").<br /><br />There's just no question that this is one to watch over and over (like revisiting a favorite recipe), which is one of the reasons it's great to have on DVD.
B000001EGA|3.0|Let's see, this one's got a self-indulgent concept (Elton and Bernie's rise to fame), painfully campy cover art, a title that seems to have been dreamed up from a parody of a '50s superhero radio show, a couple of glitzy, Vegas-like rockers (\\"Meal Ticket\\"; \\"Better off Dead\\"), a few melodramatic ballads (\\"Writing\\"; \\"Curtains\\"; \\"Bitter Fingers\\", with an awful synthesizer part). And yet, if you can look past all that, if you go in expecting something less than a full-on confessional masterpiece, you might find plenty of interest here: the majestically overdone ballad \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\" was the hit, and there's more where that came from (\\"We all Fall in Love Sometimes\\"). The folksy, down-home title song actually does have a bunch of strong imagery about the duo's roots; \\"Tower of Babel\\" has a killer guitar part; \\"When the Whistle Blows\\", a strong vocal. Among the bonus tracks are two #1's: the disco-till-you-drop \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\", which is a lot better than it sounds, and a disgraceful cover of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", featuring John Lennon on backup vocals.

A joy to listen to, guaranteed to make you smile if you watched Twin Peaks back in the day.  My driving style has already improved by having this playing in the car!
B00004T8RK|2.0|I really dismissed this one the first time I heard this, but like No Code it's slightly grown on me: as usual the classic rockers (\\"Breakerfall\\"; \\"God's Dice\\"; \\"Evacuation\\"; \\"Grievance\\") are best, though none of them match \\"Alive\\". As usual, the ballady stuff is boring and dull (\\"Light Years\\", \\"Nothing is As it Seems\\"; \\"Thin Air\\"; the aptly titled \\"Insignificance\\"). Okay, one of the ballady things is good: \\"Of the Girl\\", which has plenty of restrained emotion and lots of cool psychedelic noises. It's, like, awesome and stuff. But here's my question: Why didn't this album end after \\"Grievance\\"? The last three songs are dumb, dumb and dumb. The biggest insult is \\"Sleight of Hand\\", which I think is supposed to sound like a Talking Heads song or something with the weird new wave rhythms and the weird new wave synthesizers. Well, it's just bad. And Eddie's singing it like he's half asleep and/or stoned (possibly at the same time!) And here's hoping I soon forget the poor acoustic folk thingy \\"Soon Forget\\", because see, that's not what Pearl Jam should be doing! At all! These guys should be rocking out! Oh, and they should make better stuff than \\"Rival\\" while they rock out, because that is a bad song! I mean, not as bad as \\"Sleight of Hand\\", which might be the worst thing the group ever did, but still bad. Now I said in the start of my review that this has slightly grown on me, as in \\"it's jumped from one to two stars\\". So still a sub-par record, still plenty to complain about: too much experimentation, too many stupid rockers, not enough quality (except for \\"Of the Girl\\". That song rules, and you know it, so admit it). I think this might be Pearl Jam's weakest album. Yeah, that sounds right.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|I'm glad that i had the chance to see a few episodes of this show on tv first otherwise i might have baught the season box and would have wasted good money for it.  It's a simple story line, with bad dialogues, and no imagination in it what so ever. The only good thing about this show is that there r a few nice looking guys and girls in it which is about all i can say about it.    So save ur money, and even more important, ur time. A rerun of an x-file or buffy episode is a better use of ur time.
B000VRH2CQ|4.0|This is the predecessor to the remix album, as most of the songs are little more than old classics given a makeover: \\"Theme for Lester Young\\" is pretty close to \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\"; \\"Better Get Hit In Yo' Soul\\" is \\"Better Git It In Your Soul\\" with sans the grunts and with a revised coda; \\"II B.S.\\" is a shortened \\"Haitian Fight Song\\"; \\"Mood Indigo\\" was previously released on Mingus Dynasty. It's hard to recommend this album as highly as I do some of the surrounding works, since no matter how good these remakes are, they're still just remakes - I'd much rather hear an album full of mostly new songs from Mingus than hear him resting on his laurels, so to speak. And other than \\"Mood Indigo\\", Mingus' previous recordings of these songs are much better. On top of that, \\"I X Love\\" is tough to recommend. There's no way this can stand in the same room as indispensable '60s albums like Oh Yeah or The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, but it'll do.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|A great loss for the viewers. Unbelievable that they canceled that show, while other grapy shows continues to flicker over the tv screen into our homes. this was really one of the detective shows i have ever seen, a genre that i never cared much about lately untill i heard about Miss Mars and her wicked talents.  And now we r back in the dark ages, too bad, but at least we had 3 seasons of fun, excitement, intelegent and twisted storries, crowned with convincing good actors.  So what can i say about Season 3 of the Mars triology, its a must have for me and totaly fun to watch...my advice, buy, u wont regrat it.
B000002AGN|5.0|Progressive jazz isn't a term you hear a lot, but it's exactly how I'd characterize this. Every song does something odd with time; \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\" switches from 9/8 to common time; \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\" has unusual ten-bar phrases (most are in increments of four); \\"Take Five\\" is appropriately in 5/4 (and has a mind-bending sax solo from Paul Desmond); \\"Three to Get Ready\\" switches between 3 and 4 every two bars; \\"Everybody's Jumpin'\\" and \\"Pick Up Sticks\\" are both in 6/4. Only \\"Kathy's Waltz\\", oddly in common time, is the exception. To further the progressive feel, \\"Everybody's Jumpin'\\" is in an atonal key. Thankfully, Brubeck isn't just some weirdo who can mess with time - he can also write a solid melody (the eccentric \\"Blue Rondo\\"; meditative \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\"; pseudo-classical \\"Three to Get Ready\\"), and has quite a band behind him, most notably Paul Desmond, who wrote the album's most memorable number, \\"Take Five\\". The album loses a bit of steam at the end, but never really lets up - all jazz fans should have a copy of this one.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I am not a music connoisseur, but I know what I like, and this voice, lyrics, and tunes I have enjoyed very much. It's my first experience with Norah Jones' music, but not my last.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Not only is this a bajoolion times better than anything I've ever heard by Jackson Browne, it's also one of the very best records of the early '70s. King has a powerful voice: slightly deep, slightly husky, and moving; and she's a hell of a songwriter. Which makes sense, given that she started off as a pro songwriter and had a decade to hone her skills. Anyway, her second solo record has more variety to it than one would thing: \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" is a relatively hard rock song; and the jazzy \\"It's Too Late\\" must've had a big influence on Joni Mitchell, though the fact is the spare piano ballads she's known for (\\"So Far Away\\"; \\"Beautiful\\"; the tender hit \\"You've Got a Friend\\"; and my favorite, the soulful insecurity of \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\") have a lot going for them, too. The only filler is the crisp country-rocker \\"Smackwater Jack\\", and even that's made up of by the abundance of strong material such as the lyrical title song, and especially the classic \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\". And really, \\"Smackwater Jack\\" isn't all that bad. So forgive me while I give this the highest rating possible in spite of one minor filler: it really is that good, and one of the best-written albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.
B000VI70WM|5.0|Quite simply put, this album is one of the best of the recent comebacks by '80's musicians. As a long-time Duran Duran fan, I'm thrilled. This album retains enough of the classic DD sound, but brings new beats and elements in. Don't listen to reviews that trash this excellent work. Order it now. You'll dance and sing for days! Duran Duran like Prince, Lionel Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, and many other '80's superstarts are proving that when they engage with younger talent, they get even better with age.
B000002BYD|2.0|So, um... \\"Brain of J\\" is a powerful screaming loud rocker with a surprisingly quiet middle section. And \\"Given to Fly\\" is an amazingly emotional power-ballad-like thing. And... and... come on guys, I'm flailing here... because in truth, a lot of it is monotonously mellow. Pearl Jam doesn't do mellow. Even \\"Black\\", \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" rocked somewhat. Okay, the mellowness on Viatology pretty much rules, but other than that? Not their thing. Which is why I can't really listen to \\"Faithful\\", \\"No Way\\", \\"Wishlist\\" or \\"Pilate\\" without feeling myself itching to hit \\"fast forward\\". Oh yeah, I like \\"Do the Evolution\\" too. Song rocks. So does the pounding, completely straightforward \\"MFC\\". But Eddie Vedder's screaming ends up being a bit of a headache. Some of the last album's weirdness shines through, but that all ends in tears (the spoken-word \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\"; the keyboard instrumental \\"Red Bar\\"; Indian instrumental \\"Hummus\\"). Cut down to the best material, this would've been a decent record, but the \\"best material\\" is, other than \\"Brain of J\\" and \\"Given to Fly\\", merely decent. A \\"Low Light\\" indeed.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|The collective opinion on this release seems to be rolling in like a freight train.  The Song Remains the Same (TSRtS), formerly, Led Zeppelin's only \\"Live\\" offering, has now (finally!) been Remastered.  It's also been Expanded with extra tracks!  And, it would seem, it also has been Altered from it's original form.<br /><br />I cannot quite understand why Rhino Records would do such a thing!  They usually do such a great job on re-issues (ie, their specialty).  Did they think this was an improvement?  Was it Jimmy Page himself that made these decisions?  Did he think no one would notice?<br /><br />For all those Led Zep fans who just love TSRtS and have memorized every note, this new version is a big let down.  They were anticipating hearing newly remastered sound associated with their beloved original tracks that they knew so well.  Sorry, that didn't happen.<br /><br />I for one, hardly ever listened to TSRtS, instead, preferring the studio album tracks.  I have replaced my late 80's discs with the '94 remastered series  (Led Zep VI was the 2nd compact disc I ever bought, now 20 yrs ago).  I looked forward to this release since I knew the '94 version of TSRtS was NOT improved sound-wise, and was simply a re-issue.<br /><br />For the typical casual fan of Led Zeppelin, and especially if you haven't listened to TSRtS a thousand times, this release will be well recieved.  There are six new tracks, and some possible different versions of some of the others.  The sound?  Well, it's AWESOME!  If you bought How the West Was Won and thought it sounded good, hold onto your hat!  This thing isn't just louder and boomier, I have been hearing some very intricate and subtle bass work by John Paul Jones that would never have been noticed on the former version.<br /><br />Over-all, this is a must buy for any Led Zeppelin fan or Classic Rock fan.  For all those people that complained about the \\"Mothership\\" release for providing absolutely NOTHING NEW!, this one tries to make up for that.  I'm giving it 5 stars.  Come on, who wants the same old same old all the time.  Accept this for what it is.  The closest thing to a NEW Led Zeppelin release we'll ever come to.on, who wants the same old same old all the time.  Accept this for what it is.  The closest thing to a NEW Led Zeppelin release we'll ever come to.
B000002GWN|4.0|How many high points is one artist allowed? In Joni's case, a whole pile. She gives a lot of the hold hits an extreme makeover, which in my mind is what all artists should do when they make live albums: the jazz fusion \\"Woodstock\\" has little to do with either her original studio recording or Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young's rock cover. That's the most extreme example, but \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" (redone as a blues-rocker), and the Miles Davis-influenced \\"Rainy Night House\\" are barely recognizable. Which is what playing live should be about: being spontaneous. After \\"Woodstock\\", everyone runs off to get high or something and they come back with \\"Cactus Tree\\" - one of my favorite Mitchell tracks, but presented in drab form here. Actually, a lot of the acoustic songs are lesser (\\"Woman of Heart and Mind\\"; and god does that buzzing on \\"A Case of You\\" get old fast - the solo piano treatment suits \\"Blue\\" and \\"For Free\\" well, but those tunes are hard to screw up).  \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" works a lot better, and the jazz-pop treatment fits it well. And the spoken intro \\"The Circle Game\\" is funny, though I still hate the off-key chorus. Oh, I forgot to say how much I like this jazz version of \\"You Turn Me On I'm a Radio\\". Lots. It's simply beautiful. And \\"Carey\\" sounds fantastic as a Steely Dan-like rocker. To top it all off, the album ends with two songs you at the time couldn't find anywhere else: \\"Jericho\\" (which eventually found its way on Don Juan's, in a far superior arrangement) and \\"Love or Money\\". \\"Jericho\\" is nothing special, but the keyboards on the funky \\"Love or Money\\" rule, and it's got an awesome sax solo too. If that weren't good enough, it's also got a cool wah guitar solo! Seriously, why wasn't that put on a studio album?
1400063515|5.0|I recieved the product in good time and it was in great shape. Brand new!  Excellent service!
B000002AZ8|4.0|This is an interesting record. Lot of experimentation, in fact more so than on any other Pearl Jam record. Now, there are \\"modern classic rock\\" songs that are the group's stock in trade and actually come off sounding quite excellent as far as resting on laurels go (\\"Last Exit\\"; \\"Spin the Black Circle\\"; \\"Not For You\\"; \\"Corduroy\\"; \\"Tremor Christ\\"), and the massive hit \\"Betterman\\", aptly described by the group's producer as a \\"Blatantly great pop song\\" - sure, it was annoyingly overplayed in its time, but it's much easier to appreciate now than it was back then, and I think it's my favorite of the group's songs (that ending is so perfect!): the similar sounding \\"Nothingman\\" is another strong point. Then there's some useless annoying stuff, like \\"Whipping\\" and \\"Pry, To\\" (which is short, thank god), as well as idiotic experiments like the polka \\"Bugs\\" (What the WTF is the point of that?), the bizarre \\"Satan's Bed\\" (\\"I want to suck Satan's dick\\" is a real lyric from that song! Now, that's just screwed, I'm sorry), the Latin-funk \\"Aye Davanita\\", and the sound collage \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Stupid\\" (note how I combined the song's two titles! Oh yes...) - sort of like an alt-rock \\"Revolution 9\\", and just as bad as that \\"song\\", too. The power-ballad \\"Immortality\\" is a keeper, though
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|when i first heard this cd on the internet, i did not really like it.  but i bought it anyway.  it is really growing on me and i am really enjoying it.
B000002BFZ|3.0|Initially I dismissed this, but it's kind of grown on me - I still don't feel it's in the same class as Ten, and it's far from perfection. The only great song is \\"Who You Are\\", a mellow pop-rocker that should have been a hit; there are also a couple stomping retro-rockers that are pretty good (\\"In My Tree\\"; \\"Smile\\"; \\"Hail, Hail\\"; \\"Red Mosquito\\"), though nowhere near the quality of \\"Alive\\" or even \\"Tremor Christ\\". So they can still bring the rock, though it's not as good as it used to be, and some of it is annoying (\\"Habit\\", another one of those amateurish screamfests that plagued Vs.; \\"Lukin'\\" - and I don't know who it is who sings on \\"Mankind\\", but I don't like them. They sound like a parody of Neil Young or something). Then there are some of those awful \\"experimental\\" songs (the spoken-word \\"I'm Open\\"; spacey \\"Present Tense\\"). There are two quiet, calm pseudo-ballads: one is good (\\"Around the Bend\\"), one is a royal bore (\\"Off He Goes\\"). You may love it, you may hate it, I think it falls right in the middle.
0752864327|1.0|Based on the reviews for this book, one could guess that it is an interesting book that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire book.  It took me over a month to finish this borefest of a book.  This book must have put me to sleep every night for a week.  You know a book is bad when you literally fall asleep in the middle of a paragraph.  Last night with 10 pages left I didn't know if I could actually finish, fortunately the misery ended and now I can move on with my life.  I think the worst part was the ending--I'll try not to spoil it for all of you, but nothing is resolved, oh I forgot there are two more books left in the series.    You all know the plot, an amnesiac super hero, blah blah blah.  He didn't know who he was and I couldn't make myself care.  Jason Bourne should have died within the first 100 pages and saved us all several weeks of our lives.  It is a shame that 1 star is the lowest rating because 1 star is generous for this overrated, over hyped book.  I guess I will stick to Vince Flynn and Harlen Coben to fill my super hero/ suspense novel desires.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Over the hill? Au contraire. Pearl Jam completes their comeback, effectively proving that Riot Act was no fluke. They're really back, and they really mean business. For the most part, anyway: I find nothing attractive about the acoustic pop of \\"Parachutes\\", and not all of the straightforward rockers leave as big of an impact as the best ones do (compare \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\" or \\"Marker in the Sand\\" to \\"Big Wave\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" - of course, the former three stand out more). One thing's for sure, though: Pearl Jam is not dead. Not quite as strong as they were on Ten, but they're still alive, still able to churn out killer rockers (the politically themed \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Army Reserve\\"; \\"Life Wasted\\"; the dynamic shifting \\"Marker in the Sand\\"), and even a successful ballad or two (the acoustic songs-turned rockers \\"Gone\\" and \\"Inside Job\\", the latter with an amazing piano; the slightly psychedelic, aching, \\"Black\\"-like \\"Come Back\\").  Some Pearl Jam fans don't like this at all, but I think it's them reaffirming their status as a good band.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is one of the best Blu-ray's ever, I know that \\"cartoons\\" normally look a lot better than non-cartoon movies; however, this one looks exceptional.  I did not see this movie at the theaters, but the video and sound quality was great at home, as expected by Blu-ray technology.
B000002KOJ|3.0|Judging strictly by the lyrics, this record would easily get full marks. In fact, the lyrics are arguably the strongest of her career, often vague and impressionistic, but still very impressive, and she touches on a lot: putting down Casanovas (\\"The Gallery\\"), painting a sympathetic portrait of mental illness (\\"I Think I Understand\\"), reflecting on life (\\"Both Sides, Now\\"), or just plain being a poet (\\"Songs to Aging Children Come\\"; the a capella \\"The Fiddle and the Drum\\"; \\"Rose Blue\\") - there's even a love song or two (\\"Chelsea Morning\\"; \\"I Don't Know Where I Stand\\"). There's more to life than just lyrics, though: the biggest - actually, the only, but it's huge - problem with this album is how often it slips into boredom. The arrangements are often reduced to just a repetitive acoustic guitar figure (maybe three of them that get sporadically reused through the album, to be precise) and vocals. And there's only so much you can do with that. Which is why, for all their lyrical virtues, songs like \\"That Song About the Midway\\"; \\"Rose Blue\\" and \\"I Think I Understand\\" fail to really do much for me. In other words, more variety of instrumentation would've been appreciated (she doesn't even work in a piano, in fact!), so that way the great songs on this album would have legs to stand on (\\"Both Sides, Now\\"; \\"Songs to Aging Children Come\\", which is chilling; \\"Chelsea Morning\\"; \\"I Don't Know Where I Stand\\"; \\"Tin Angel\\")
B000UX6THK|5.0|Great series.  I had forgotten a lot, but am glad to re-live the story so far.  This series incorporates so many different themes.  It's a love story, drama, mystery, and a terrifying psychological horror all at the same time.
B000002IZ4|4.0|I'm willing to bet this is STP's overall best album. Here they expand their sound (\\"Pretty Penny\\" is mostly acoustic; \\"Lounge Fly\\" is, in order, 1/3 Guns n' Roses, 1/3 Crosby, Stills & Nash, and another third Guns n' Roses; \\"Interstate Love Song\\" is southern rock) sharpen their songwriting, and come up with something pretty damn good. Okay, so not \\"Silvergun Superman\\" or \\"Meat Plow\\", flat reworkings of the Core sound. Neither have much personality. I don't really like the slash-and-burn punk song \\"Unglued\\" either. It just sounds out of place. But man, \\"Interstate Love Song\\" makes up for all of that. The riffs, the vocals, the chorus and the opening are all absolutely perfect. Actually, the entire song is absolutely perfect. I don't think Soundgarden ever made a song as good as that. Or The White Stripes, while I'm at it. \\"Big Empty\\" does, too. It goes from slide-driven delta blues to hard-rock in the verses and choruses. You not only get a dynamic shift (which everyone was doing back then), but a stylistic shift, too! And \\"Army Ants\\" is a psychedelic hard southern rocker. They even go for a winding, four-minute epic (with hidden track attached, of course) on \\"Candybars and Kitchenware\\". A lot of bands would screw this up, but STP gets it perfectly! It's not as good as \\"Where the River Goes\\" from the last album, but I don't care, because it's a good song. The lounge-jazz hidden track, an ironic crooned \\"thank-you-for-listening\\", is pretty funny, too. I'd hesitate to call anything by the Pilots brilliant, but I enjoy this.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Say what you want about Linkin Park, but don't say they are consistent. While this is definitely within the realm of the sound of Linkin Park, it does nothing to move them forward in the direction that MADE them as popular as they are. They have moved away from the angst, the energy seems to have left them. I am not against bands experimenting with their sound, and trying new things, however, if they want to remain 'successful' they need to not entirely leave what got them there.    There are far too many ballads, and not enough of that raw emotion that forced them to the top of the charts.    If you don't mind the lighter side of Linkin Park, then you'll have no problems with the album, and by all means buy it, however, if your looking for more of the hard, emo rock, and raw emotion of the earlier albums, you WILL be disappointed!
B000002AGM|4.0|A so-called classic that I nevertheless can't give more than three and a half stars to in good faith. Much of that has to do with my small-group prejudice (yeah, I like Duke Ellington, but come on - who doesn't?) Miles here is backed by nineteen guys, and none of them do any soloing but Miles. It's very rigorously structured - first, the big band (and Miles) play the theme, then Miles begins his solos while the other nineteen guys do nothing but chime in occasional harmonies. And then there's the fact that the songs are so short. Miles' music works perfectly in extended settings, so I can honestly say I'm not too keen on him doing three-to-five-minute songs (which are, again, so tightly structured that Miles rarely has an opportunity to truly let his creative side loose). The thing I like about this record, though, is its emotional range. You've got your token quiet, moody songs (\\"The Maids of Carnez\\", \\"My Ship\\", \\"Lament\\"), your uptempo fun stuff (\\"New Rhumba\\", \\"Springsville\\", title track), some Latin (\\"Blues for Pablo\\") some blues (\\"The Meaning of the Blues\\"), and some rather hokey traditionalist big-band jazz (\\"The Duke\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Be Kissed (By Anyone But You)\\"). And it must be said that I don't find a single song on this album flat-out bad. Some could've been better, yes, but none of these songs are insulting or anything. So yeah, good stuff, but hasn't Miles done better? Of course he has.
B00005JPKE|4.0|Might I say a standard \\"the enemies are human too\\" movie with some dabs of Japanese culture thrown in.  I watched as I enjoyed the small amount of exposure to Japanese culture.  Obviously, much better production values than were used in the John Wayne days.-- Louis J Sheehan
B000001EG6|4.0|Uneven as all get-out, but at times this is unbelievably good. The beautiful, melodic love song \\"Your Song\\" was the first and arguably best of John's big hits: the strength of the melody and John's emotional performance help it rise above moronic lyrics like \\"If I was a sculptor/But, then again, no\\" - a lyric that makes some of my worst moments look like \\"The Raven\\". It's all about that melody, you know? Interestingly, \\"Your Song\\" was a b-side: its flip, the manic, lyrically incoherent unbridled rocker \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\" is another personal favorite, even though I've got no clue what the hell Bernie's talking about. Several other songs pack a punch too, most of them energetic: the gospel shouter \\"Border Song (Holy Moses)\\", which got the royal treatment from Aretha Franklin and became the highlight of her sterling Young, Gifted and Black album; \\"The Cage\\", a solid song about alienation; the threatening \\"King Must Die\\"; and the low-key \\"I Need You to Turn to\\". Paul Buckmaster's orchestration dominates as usual, and while it never gets out of hand on the best tunes, it's responsible for screwing up the worst ones (\\"Sixty Years On\\"; \\"The Greatest Discovery\\"; \\"Last Episode at Hienton\\", the first of many sexist Taupin songs). Speaking of sexism, there's a dollop of it on the awful country parody \\"No Shoestrings on Louise\\", which is arguably the worst Elton John song not found on Victim of Love. This is a pretty good album, but it can't stand in the same room as the next one.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Comedian Oswald Patton as the voice of the rat? Well, sure. It was great voice casting and so is the rest of the voices. Great animation, incredible camera work (the rat chase on the carts is phenomenal...) - it's the INCREDIBLES production, upped.
B000026FOA|5.0|Not quite as minimalist as Pink Moon, which is part of what makes it debatably Drake's best record, and certainly the first album to get. Incidentally, it's also his debut. The album is about as folksy as folksy gets: some of it is filtered through country (\\"Time Has Told Me\\"), other times through chamber music (\\"Day is Done\\"; \\"Cello Song\\"). The string arrangements are often quite captivating: they ruin \\"Way to Blue\\", at least for me; but give a lot of flavor to \\"Day is Done\\" and especially \\"Cello Song\\". Not to take credit away from Nick himself: his meditations on life, love, and loneliness are often fascinating (\\"Three Hours\\"; \\"The Thoughts of Mary Jane\\"). I'll admit it's a bit hard to understand Drake's quiet, mumbling diction, but even then sometimes it's nice just to sit back and let his soft baritone take you away (the hypnotic \\"Fruit Tree\\"). Bits of this ramble, sure (\\"River Man\\"; \\"Man in a Shed\\"), but all things considered this is a hell of an album. Oh, and if you liked Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, you'd be glad to know that \\"Saturday Sun\\" is comfortably close to that album's best moments. I don't think Bachman-Turner Overdrive could put out something anywhere near this. Do you?
B000068PQ0|4.0|I had never listened to Flaming Lips before. A few days ago, this album showed up among the recommendations in Real Rhapsody. Usually I don't care much about these recommendations, but the funny album name and cover art caught my attention. At first I didn't know what to expect but then slowly started liking the music. I find this album a bit strange, not to mention that it's a bit quirky too. But at the same time, it's pretty good. One reason why I find it strange is its theme - a Japanese girl fights evil pink robots to save mankind. But wait.. the fight gets over on the fourth track. Up to this point, the mood has been quite upbeat. Then what? Suddenly all the songs become very sad (the other reason why I find it strange). The last seven songs are about life, death and loss. They all sound very philosophical (but not cheesy) and will make you ponder over the meaning of life.    The album opens with the incredibly catchy first track \\"Fight Test\\", which is probably the best song in the album. This track is the reason I came back to listening to this album and started liking the other songs too. The second track (\\"One More Robot\\") is a bit strange as it starts quite happily, but later becomes melancholic. The next two songs are the first and second parts of the title track. Quite experimental, but good. The remaining songs are all sad. Out of these, I especially liked the fifth (\\"In the Morning Of The Magicians\\"), sixth (\\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell\\") and tenth (\\"All We Have Is Now\\") tracks. Over the last few days, I have been listening to this album a lot... never thought I would :) Highly recommended.
B000025H0Q|4.0|The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded. There's even a near-rocker (\\"Hazy Janey II\\"), albeit one in Nick's usual somber style. I actually don't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one: a bunch of weak instrumentals (title track; \\"Sunday\\"; \\"Fly\\"), and \\"Poor Boy\\" is the closest to overproduced Drake gets. Regardless, there are several fantastic songs: \\"Hazy Janey II\\" and its psychedelic-folk counterpart, \\"Hazy Janey I\\"; \\"At the Chime of a City Clock\\", which is some good jazzy stuff; \\"One of Those Things First\\" is charming but slightly rambling; and \\"Northern Sky\\" is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake's catalogue, which is saying something. So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile.

B000002GK1|4.0|A quantum leap from the stupid early sub-Sabbath albums. Okay, so there are still a couple issues; two overlong sludgefests  (\\"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\\"; \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\"). As for \\"Mind Riot\\" and \\"Holy Water\\"? Eh... I could think of better ways to spend my five minutes, thank you. But man, are there songs here, like the art-metal \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" (the best tune in Soundgarden history, I think); free jazz crossed with metal \\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\\" (no seriously, there's an atonal sax break in it! It rules!), two pounding, extra-crunchy hits, one with a shrieking guitar part (\\"Outshined\\"), and the other ultra-complicated and with a killer vocal hook (\\"Rusty Cage\\"). And the echoey vocal bit at the end of \\"Somewhere\\" kicks a**, I'll add. Plus the closing sludge epic \\"New Damage\\" is awesome. Especially near the end, where the wah-wah comes in and it really springs to life. So while Superunknown got most the kudos, this is probably my favorite Soundgarden album.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|i don't hear what all the raves are about. the songs are all decent, but i always expect more than that from springsteen. even on his \\"average\\" cd's there's always at least one song that will stop me in my tracks. this time...no. part of the problem is the sound - i can barely distinguish what he's singing most of the time, because the mix is so dense and busy. oh well, when the standard has been set impossibly high by works like \\"the rising\\" you can't fault the guy for not reaching that level every time.
B000001DQG|2.0|See, here's the problem with Caribou: It isn't very good. There are hits, oh yes - what Elton album would be complete without hits? Those are good. \\"The B*tch is Back\\" is a funny heavy rocker with a full brass section and is not sexist, unlike... oh, I dunno, everything else Bernie Taupin ever wrote: the \\"b*tch\\" is the singer, you see. \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", meanwhile, is one of Elton's many classic love ballads with another one of those soaring refrains. \\"Stinker\\" is a rewrite of \\"The B*tch is Back\\", but I don't care - it's a damn good time. And \\"I've Seen the Saucers\\" is cool in its eeriness. On the other hand, I really wish Bernie Taupin would stop parodying country, since \\"Dixie Lily\\" just may be worse than \\"No Shoestrings on Louise\\", which is an impressive feat; \\"Pinky\\" and \\"Grimbsy\\" are yet more cheesy ballads; \\"You're So Static\\" is more unwarranted misogyny; \\"Ticking\\" has no reason to exist; \\"Solar Prestige Whatever\\" is a painful sequel to \\"Sun King\\". Oh, and the cover image makes Captain Fantastic's look like a Da Vinci.
0312117337|5.0|I was introduced to these cards by Mary Phelan (telepathicTV), and wanted my own set.  I have been a traditional Rider-Waite user. Nevertheless, Mary's readings opened the Zen path to me in a new light.  I am still getting to know them, but the wonderful artwork and interpretations of the Osho Zen Tarot have given me several introspective hours already. I would recommend this deck to students of Tarot, or as a tool to help awaken the spirit with Zen philosophy.
B00008CLOA|5.0|According to Wiki, this album has been on the billboard charts now for 1500 weeks and is the best selling<br />album in the history of recorded music. I always thought that this has some of the best lyrics and songs<br />ever recorded, and I guess it is true, it is estimated that 1 out of every 14 people ON EARTH own or have owned this album. It you haven't owned this you are probably very young or off world. If you don't own this, buy it. It doesn't get any better then this.

1400063515|3.0|I first fell for this book when by browsing its pages I saw references to Umberto Eco and Hume, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, etc. It was a good \\"commercial\\" trick but after reading it all these are no more than a name dropping exercise. The book is extremely self centered in such an extent that I found Mr. Taleb to be the first self sycophant in History.   The introduction appears like an epiphany but the more you read (if you can overcome the permanent references to the next chapters a la \\"Soap\\" but unfortunately without a Billy Crystal in sight) the more you sense that the thread of thought is fundamentaly flawed; like a book on Architecture that is constantly referring that Chartres Cathedral is of no value because it isn't tsunami resistant.  I have the feeling that Mr. Taleb's puzzlement (and this book is all about that) is rooted on the fact that he might have missed that niggling Mathematics classroom when the Logic quantifiers were taught.  It has its intellectual appeal but mostly for New York Times readers. Surely LA or even Miami newspaper readers will have other things to ponder.  To resume this book tells us (time and again) that \\"History has no history\\" but I guess we all knew that already.
0385340559|1.0|Clunky and borderline boring. Very predictable.<br />Child shows quite a bit of political bias as well.<br />Somehow I can't see Reacher being a big supporter of PETA as he appears in this story.  And what's this bit about Orange County Republicans supporting law breakers because they're so in love with guns and the 2nd Amendment.  (Lots of folks in the his UK probably wish they HAD a 2nd Amendment.)  Finally, why take on the LAPD?  His contention that all retirees from LAPD are crooks and bad guys leaves a bad taste.<br />Too political and not very entertaining.
B000VI70X6|5.0|We like every song that she ever made and have all the CDs and DVDs, so this was a pleasure to watch and in my opinion anything from Shakira is much better than anything else outthere. So I cannot be objective. Seeing two of her concerts last year - I think that the transfer to DVD was very very good.   I want to take a moment and list only the negatives.  The dissapointment for us and for anybody else that attended the December 6 concert - we were told before the show that the concert would be recorded and turned into a DVD. This is the December 9 concert.   The extras are mixed, a bad reportage about the tour of the world and a good one on Barranquila and Fundacion Piez Descalzos. The video clips are poor quality, nothing spectacular. The DVD has no subtitles and no lyrics are available - something that her previous ones had. The CD only has 6 of the songs from the concert. The DVD insert has very small fonts - impossible to read unless you use a loupe - I uploaded a picture.

0385341067|5.0|_Mr. Pip_ is a book you will never forget.  You are transported onto a sea-island covered with exotic jungle and mountain terrain. Pip, of course, is from Dickens' _Great Expectations_; but Pip becomes another character of huge importance on the island.  The main themes of the book are learning through the life/death cycle, escaping violence by reading, cultivating imagination, and questioning truth in everything.  The writing couldn't be better--fluid and fluent, with special bits of attention to what words mean and how words affect lives.      If you enjoy _Mr. Pip_, you would might like _Mr. Timothy_, a novel about Tim Cratchit from _A Christmas Carol_.  Remember, Tiny Tim did NOT die...
B000TGJ80S|3.0|Coopola's Dracula is a very mixed bag.  The novel has its problems and so does the film.  On the plus side, it has Gary Oldman's wonderful performance, the costumes and photography are gorgeous, the Count Vlad framing story is really interesting and approproate. However, Dracula as a Christ figure?  Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are awful and what the hell was Anthony Hopkin's doing.  The DVD is absolutely perfect and the second dsic is very involving.  Not a bad purchase but, this had potential to be a great film and it isn't.  Joe Tucci
B000002JKS|4.0|When I was a teenage metalhead in the 80's, Led Zeppelin was a mythic institution, almost a religion unto itself. By association, Robert Plant had a cachet that few musicians could exploit. So when his solo singles started coming out, I was a bit puzzled. It seemed as though he was  moving away from the bombast and (horrors!) embracing fully what I reckoned was the pop glitz of the day. Compared to the other bands that made up the heavy side of the equation for me in those days, Plant was rapidly becoming a has been. Nonetheless, I continued to buy his LP's partly as a show of respect and partly out of curiosity.     \\"Shaken n Stirred\\" caused me to stop listening to Robert Plant's solo material. I appreciated \\"Little by Little\\" as a guilty pleasure and was hoping the rest of the album would be of similar flavor. Not so. My friends and I pronounced the album unlistenable - the music sounded like a disjointed mash of synth cheese, bad humor, and jerky beats that violated every sense of rock.     Fast forward to today: I recently had an opportunity to pickup the remastered version of this album for cheap. I thought it would be funny to hear how horrible the record was again, a cheap reminiscence of sorts. At least \\"Little by Little\\" would stand the test of time, right?    This is probably Robert Plant's most ambitious artistic endeavor. It is a musically violent move away from Zeppelin and the constraints he felt from having that mythic legacy hung around his neck. Is the music difficult? Yes, I would not put this on at a party or if I wanted to feel nostalgic, comforted. The music is almost Cubist in nature, similar to Modernist literature. Beats are deconstructed, melodies are stretched to their limit, and even the production plays with normal conceptions of dynamics by unexpectedly flattening the mix or popping certain sounds to the fore. In a strange way, the album foreshadows (and critiques?)the current trend in commercial music where dynamics are pointedly artificial: nonexistent or seemingly unrelated to the music being performed.    More than anything else, the album pokes fun at the cult of Zeppelin, and commercial music in general. Consider, for example, this snippet from \\"Too Loud\\":         \\"Much consideration to the Aethenian religion       has been given to this whole project,       which can be interchanged by the entire record buying public.       It is not quite inconceivable that it has absolutely nothing,       absolutely nothing to do with this, sorry,\\"    Plant, was, and still is, above all an artist, and in looking to extend his craft ran up against the myth that had built up around him. Once he became a classic, he was embalmed in the minds of Zep fans, a state of affairs that no evolving artist can live under. This album is the response.    So is it good? As experimental music, I would say yes, with the caveat that it does not always succeed in maintaining a level of relevance or novelty. The playing is top notch, and the compositions are quite meticulous (if a bit opaque at first). Some of the keys sound dated, but the recording is startling in its clarity, Paul Martinez' bass tones are simply gorgeous. You do have to listen to this with an open mind, and try to get in on the joke instead of being the butt of it. As music, it works. As rock, it fails.
0140449337|5.0|In Plato's Republic, Socrates discusses the possibility of a philosopher king; that is, a person who would rule in a way that is just, because their thoughts and desires are outgrowths of their philosophical ideologies.  Socrates suggests that this would be the best of all possible rulers - and, of course, the implication is that Plato would be this greatest ruler, because the philosophy a ruler 'should' follow, was Plato's.  Marcus Aurelius was Emperor of Rome from 161 A.D. until his death in 180 A.D.  He was the last of the five great Emperors who ruled Rome during a period which Edward Gibbon, writing his magnificent The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, described as the time when the world was at its happiest and most prosperous.  He was not, as far as anyone else knew, a philosopher - he was simply (and sufficiently) a proficient Emperor, an able ruler, a good statesmen.  And yet, in those quiet moments of leisure when he was able to take off the mantle of Emperor, Marcus Aurelius composed some of the most important works of Stoic philosophy.  A series of meditations, exercises for himself, admonitions to himself, exhortations of how to be a better person.      What is immediately clear about Aurelius' Meditations is that they were written for an intimate audience of one.  There is no grandstanding or pompous declarations of power or influence.  There are no revelations or secrets or negative comments about current affairs.  Whatever Marcus Aurelius' thoughts on the world outside himself, we are left mostly in the dark for this work.  Rather, what he has done - or aims to do - is to intimately examine himself, to highlight his flaws and to recognise, but not always praise, his positive qualities.  Most importantly, the Meditations are just that - a collection of thoughts, concepts, ideas and moral positions which Aurelius wishes to follow at all times.  It is a handbook to himself on how best to live his life.      Two strains of thought which run through almost every page of the Meditations is first, the responsibility of a person's actions, and second, the concept of death.  In Book 5, Aurelius writes, 'Another does wrong.  What is that to me?  Let him see to it: he has his own disposition, his own action.  I have now what universal nature wishes me to have now, and I do what my own nature wishes me to do now.'  Personal responsibility is an important theme for Aurelius, but more than that, he requires a constant awareness within himself that while he is responsible for his own actions, he is not responsible for the actions of others, and should not let himself be affected by their bad deeds.  He writes that if a man smells bad, it does no good to get angry.  Rather, what should be done is to calmly inform the person, and then leave the matter in their hands.  If they change and improve themselves, you have done your duty.  If not, your duty has still been done - the fault remains with the other person.  This concept of the self's responsibility for the self is an interesting one when taken into interactions with others.  If we are to examine our feelings, does it really make sense for us to become angry at the folly of another?  Surely, as Aurelius states, it is best simply to help them as much as we can, and then leave the choice of being angry or upset to them.  What have we to be angry for?  Nothing, if we live our lives the best way we can.    A second major thought is death.  Aurelius reminds himself that death is something that will happen to everyone, and thus should not be feared.  'Think of the whole of existence, of which you are the tiniest part; think of the whole of time, in which you have been assigned a brief and fleeting moment; think of destiny - what fraction of that are you?'  And again: 'How many who once rose to fame are now consigned to oblivion: and how many who sang their fame are long disappeared.'  Marcus Aurelius writes to remind himself that fame, no matter how glorious, begins to fade the moment death takes you away - and sometimes before.  He believed death to be either a cessation of thought, which meant it wouldn't matter to you once you were dead, or an alteration of consciousness (ie Heaven), which meant the current consciousness - your current life - would not matter then, either.  Thus, the important thing to do with yourself is to be the best and most noble person you can be.  'The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.'    It is important to remember that the man who wrote these words was arguably the most powerful man in the world at the time.  That he could rule the greatest Empire the world had yet seen, and still write with such modesty and grace, is something truly admirable.  He calls for the moral life, the good life, and is constantly chastening himself to live the way he knows is best.  As these works were most likely never intended for publication, they can and should be seen as Aurelius stripping himself of all physical and temporal difficulties to concern his mind purely and only with what is truly important.  That he was able to explore himself with such honesty, and write with such clarity, is nothing short of astonishing.  Each page contains short passages of great wisdom, alongside longer paragraphs of thought that tower above the carefully crafted citadel of morality which concerns most of the work.      The Penguin Classic edition of this work contains one hundred and thirty pages of notes, an index of names and an index of quotations, as well as a general index.  These indexes offer the non-specialist reader a wealth of information regarding the scattered quotes and references that populate Aurelius' text.  It is the notes section, however, that truly shines.  Each of the twelve books of the Meditations are summarised and explained, and then the more difficult concepts and allusions are further detailed.  Thus, a curious reader is able to read the explanation, while a scholar or student has, in the same book, detailed references and starting points for further research.  Complimentary to that is a fine introduction by Diskin Clay, who gives an overview of Marcus Aurelius' life and times.      The Meditations is very short, at one hundred and twenty-two pages.  Each book is roughly ten pages, with most of the writings being only a few lines.  What this means is that it is a remarkably easy work to pick up and put down, and coupled with the directness and elegance of his writing, the Meditations becomes a novel that could easily serve as a companion for life.  Marcus Aurelius' writing is not directed towards a race or class or gender or temperament, rather, it is directed inwards, at the mind and the soul, two fundamental aspects of humanity we all possess.  It is somewhat trite to say that there is 'something for everything' within a work, but in the case of the Meditations, it is true.  Read this book and find solace in the work of an elegant mind and a worthy outlook on life.
B000002J1M|5.0|My good friend Chris Fournier (aka Fonya) gave me this CD in the mid 90s. I listened to it once, then put it away for a couple of years before I got it back out and really listened to it. Lesson: for many people, music like this takes time to hook you, but once it does, you're hooked for life. Listen, listen, and listen again.    I read another review saying that a radio station in Los Angeles used to play Supper's Ready in its entirety. I lived near Pittsburgh, and the station there played the entire Dark Side of the Moon album! I wish they would have introduced me to Foxtrot back in the early 70s too. All these years without hearing Get 'em Out by Friday, Can Utility and the Coastliners, and, of course, Supper's Ready. What a shame...    This is not my favorite Genesis album/CD, but it does have my favorite song by any artist: Supper's Ready. The story seems to parallel the Book of Revelation in the Bible. I like to think of it as a love song--a man expressing the depth of his love for his wife by comparing it to the Bible's story of Christ's love for the church. The music is incredible! I particularly like Apocalypse in 9/8--this is Phil Collins at his finest as a drummer.
B000002BQK|5.0|What was up in 1997? Janet released her amazing \\"The Velvet Rope\\", and Kylie released \\"Impossible Princess\\". However, none of those two albums could come close to Mariah's now-classic \\"Butterfly\\", which remains one of the most essential R&B Albums of all time.<br /><br />THE BEST:<br /><br />\\"Breakdown\\" is perhaps the greatest thing here. Even Missy Elliot was stunned when she first heard the track. Lead singles \\"Honey\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" are good yes, but the slow burner \\"Close My Eyes\\" will leave you speechless - a perfect R&B/pop song.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />Mariah's version of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" isn't close to the original, but still very good. \\"Fourth of July\\" is a sensuous slinker of a track, and of course, this album also contains that critical Mariah hit \\"The Roof\\" (many call this her best track ever).<br /><br />Obviously, there is nothing 'bad' about this CD. At its' time it was genre-breaking and revolutionary, but more than ten years later, its still as fresh and appealing as ever. This was Mariah's best work, by far, as she married her vocal stylings to a perfect blend of soul/R&B, and the whole thing WORKED. Even Mariah has been unable to make anything to top this.<br /><br />An Essential Recording. Five Stars.

B000654Z2I|5.0|I've always been a fan of weird music. I'm a devotee to Mr. Bungle, Frank Zappa & The Mothers, Captain Beefheart & The Magic Band, Butthole Sufers, Pere Ubu, Edgard Varese, The Residents, Renaldo & The Loaf, Sonic Youth, John Cage, Snakefinger, Kraftwerk, John Zorn, Faust, etc. etc. and CAN is one of the best. The first track I heard from this album was \\"Mushroom\\" which, at times sounds like Kurt Cobain. The first time I heard it I knew I had to have it. I then went on to play the record,and it makes your balls go straight into your abdomen. At the time when I first heard this, there really were hardly any artists that had the guts to put something out like this! Damo Suzuki and Can's live shows were extreme. They had a juggling butler, while the band spun out the most mezmerizing powerful music ever. There was so much energy that sometimes concert-goers would vomit and faint. Can is a group who hardly ever wrote songs to paper. They preffered improvised jamming, and when they were in the studio, they would record many tapes, cut them up, and randomly put them together. Damo also would not write lyrics down, he'd come up with them on the spot.  This particular recording is mind-bending, beautiful, hypnotizing, funny, scary, and all of the above. It's very schizophrenic. The album opens with \\"Paperhouse\\", which is a bit more accessible sounding to most untrained ears. Towards the end of the track it becomes a frantic psychedelic workout, leading directly into \\"Mushroom\\", a tight rocking track led mainly by Damo's vocals. As usual the drumming is attention grabbing. The sound of the drums, as well as the sense of timing Jaki has is unbelievable. Emmediatley after the track, an explosion is heard leading into trippy \\"Oh Yeah\\". The song's vocals are backwards, the keyboard has a ascending/descending feel. The drummer is on fire. The bass riff is tight, in a way a song of it's own. The guitar licks towards the end sound like Jimmy Page on acid. Next is \\"Halleluwah\\" clocking in at an odd 18 minutes and 33 seconds.It's a funky jam with pounding drums. Not much to be said about this track, it's more simplistic than the other tracks, but equally as great. Next on here is \\"Aumgn\\", which sounds like a John Cage soundscape, or something from a Renaldo & The Loaf record.  It's a good 17 minutes of dogs barking, low hums, insane percussion, and the keyboardist is heavily experimenting with sound here. Next is a track that I play real loud for the neighbors to hear. It's \\"Peking O\\" which starts off sounding pretty much like the meaty part of \\"Aumgn\\", then at about 5 minutes into it, Damo is obviously tripping on acid. He screams mad gibberish, at one point it sounds like he's screaming \\"AHHH!!! IT'S GONNA KILL ME!!!!!!!AHHHHH!!!!!I'M GONNA KILL YOU!!!!!!\\" wonderful stuff.  Once that insanity is over the Radiohead like \\"Bring Me Coffee Or Tea\\" begins. A Beautiful piece that is perfect for ending this mad record. I've heard alot of reviewers say this album is like a dream. I agree. It starts off kind of dozily and then it gets a little more adventourous, then a little weird, then really scary, then once \\"Bring Me Coffee OR Tea\\" starts, it's like you've woken up thinking \\"What did I just dream?\\"  It's an experience like taking to much Niquil and then going to sleep and having 7 odd dreams. The more you listen, the better it gets. Ahead of it's time? It still is...nothing sounds like this. It's music for the future by the past. It's an impressive piece. You never get tired of it because with every listen, you hear something you didn't hear before.  5/5. Wonderful.

0792846443|1.0|I had a hankering to watch this movie, so I started to last night.  But somehow the movie didn't interest me at all.  I had absolutely no interest in what was going to happen next because,<br />1) I didn't care about the character of Paul Sheldon.  If you want the audience to be on the edge of their seat when a character is in peril, you have to get the audience to IDENTIFY with that character, as happens for the first half of Titanic.  But Misery is like Titanic starting half-way in.  It doesn't work that way.  Even con-men know this.  That's why they are called CONfidence Men.  In this movie, my only reaction to Paul Sheldon was annoyance.  He seems like a typically lousy writer with a slovenly personality.  I didn't mind that he was getting tortured.<br />2) The plot was implausible and uninteresting.  Sheldon is far too docile and unresourceful.  He just sits there like he should have a sweatshirt that says VICTIM.  Caring about a born victim is for suckers.  Real victims usually try to save themselves a lot more desperately than he did.  His token efforts to save himself were token at BEST.  So I turned it off wondering what possessed me to ever want to watch it.
B000YKFJ66|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. I am not sure why other people would give it a low score.
140120306X|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.     Moore has created an extraordinarily rich mythology in which characters from folk lore, literature and legend coexist without contradiction.     Whilst volume 2 included some additional \\"background reading\\", detailing additional journeys undertaken by the two main protagonists, the Black Dossier goes further; and reimagines characters and locations from across the entire breadth and history of fiction.     On first reading, a conventional plot would appear to be lacking. The point is however, that the plot is to be inferred; taken from all the various written passages in combination with the conventional comic book.    I'm hardly disappointed. There is so much to enjoy here, from the perfect stylistic period pieces, to the debauched eroticism and psychedelic finale. However, I think volume 2 was more satisfying, striking a perfect balance between the story and the encyclopedic information pertaining to Moore's new universe.
B00004VXXA|5.0|It is said that if we don't learn from history we are bound to repeat it. Could it be that the actors journey in this movie shows a little glimpse as to the souls journey if we assume that we have a soul? That we only really graduate once we have learned the lessons that are here on this planet and that otherwise we will just get reincarnated over and over and given another chance at learning.     Initially the character, once he realises that he is \\"stuck\\" starts abusing his power and sees how he can fulfill his hedonistic desires by manipulating events and people. As he gets bored with himself and his tricks, he discovers the creative principle, and starts on the journey of serving others and contribute to life and thus he starts learning.     So this movie had a strong effect on me and I rate it highly both because it a highly entertaining movie, which is well acted, but especially because of the deeper layer that is there to be seen.     I would recommend the book [[ASIN:0976406497 The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive]], as it explores in depth the idea that life is a school, where we have the possibility to learn.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|This is one great album from MegaDeth that shreds from the opening track \\"Sleepwalker\\" right until the very end. There is just one minor problem with the albums lyrics in my opinion, while I support Dave Mustaine's more conservative views that he's taken on I don't care for the Neo-con bend that they can have at times. That's the only reason that I couldn't give the album a perfect \\"5 star\\" rating.    Musically the album has some of Dave's best work and tracks such as \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"Gears of War\\" and \\"You're Dead\\" are among MegaDeth's very best in my opinion.    Definetly get this album if you are a fan of Thrash Metal and enjoy!!!
B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who recorded an entire two hour plus concert in February 1970 at a University in Leeds, England. A little more than half of the show is captured in this 1995 re-release, but it's the best half. This version captures all the power and the glory of perhaps the best live rock band ever at their very peak of creativity, energy and cohesiveness with great sound and clarity.    The Who had delivered perhaps the most riveting set of all the acts at the famed Woodstock Festival six months earlier and then toured the US more or less continually after Woodstock to capitalize on their increased fame. They were delivering some of the most powerful shows ever seen in rock and roll, before or since. I saw one of those shows, and it was the best rock concert I ever heard (and I have heard hundreds by most of the usual greats).They were so loud it was scary. My ears rang for two days. The band as a combo was so dynamic and so energized it was hard to believe.     They were performing their rock opera Tommy from start to finish, and then they also played another hour of Who early classics, plus some  classic covers from their R and B days. So what you got was their amazing Summertime Blues, Mose Allison's \\"Young Man's Blues\\", Magic Bus, Substitute, and of course My Generation.     Keith Moon was a marvel, nobody has ever played better rock drums then he did on that tour(louder and bigger, maybe, thank you Mr. Bonham, but not better),and at this concert he was at his very best.He and John Entwistle together were inventing new ways for a rhythm section to play (with the bass actually being the lead instrument in sections while also keep the time while Keith goes into another dimension). Listen to Amazing Journey/Sparks, the one section on this release from Tommy. They find God...ohhhh God. And Roger had found his voice, and Pete still had all that rage and that beautiful rhythm sound, and you can hear it with amazing clarity(you have to imagine the great vertical leaps).     Thisparticular version of the Live at Leeds concert has all of the best early Who hits, plus the great covers, but only one nine minute portion from Tommy, that Journey/Sparks combo. Listen to the 2002 extended release if you want to hear the whole Tommy. But I think it's better like this, the sound mix is better too. The original vinyl was short and great, this is somewhat longer and much improved in sonics. Buy it and turn it up so loud you risk eviction or divorce or electronic meltdown.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is a great movie with a sobering message. The showing in this movie of how Big Pharma uses poor African countries to test run their drugs before potentially releasing them into the West is all to true. The headline in the news today was \\"Nigeria Takes On Pfizer over 'Killer Drug'\\" and is just one such example of how close to the truth the film is.     See this movie and be aware that the events portrayed are actually happening. To understand what kind of people would deliberately do such things, read the book [[ASIN:1897244258 Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)]] by Andrew Lobaczewski and the book by Robert Hare called [[ASIN:1572304510 Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us]]. It explains a lot about the world we live in, that is worth knowing.
B000PC8AFU|2.0|Talk about pillaging the legacy of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan! The record company takes a few previously unreleased tunes (which are available on bootlegs), tacks on a few more duets, and then prices it a damn near $20.00 with tax. There have been some excellent releases from Vaughan's vaults, but this is not one of them by a longshot. Save your money and pass this rip off up. Shame on whoever put this out.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|With no hesitation had to pick this one up.An album made of mostly short songs,this is a simply, perfect, straight rock album. Setting Forth,Far Behind,Rise,Long Nights and Hard Sun make this a \\"classic\\" effort.If you like Eddie and P J,which I'm sure you do,what ya waiting for.Get it now.A solid 4.5 .

B00005U8EM|5.0|It is said that if we don't learn from history we are bound to repeat it. Could it be that the actors journey in this movie shows a little glimpse as to the souls journey if we assume that we have a soul? That we only really graduate once we have learned the lessons that are here on this planet and that otherwise we will just get reincarnated over and over and given another chance at learning.     Initially the character, once he realises that he is \\"stuck\\" starts abusing his power and sees how he can fulfill his hedonistic desires by manipulating events and people. As he gets bored with himself and his tricks, he discovers the creative principle, and starts on the journey of serving others and contribute to life and thus he starts learning.    So this movie had a strong effect on me and I rate it highly both because it a highly entertaining movie, which is well acted, but especially because of the deeper layer that is there to be seen.    I would recommend the book [[ASIN:0976406497 The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive]], as it explores in depth the idea that life is a school, where we have the possibility to learn.

B000Y179KO|4.0|Must say,I rarely give a group 5 stars,but came close on this one.Ran into Walmart,where I never go to get this album .It was well worth it.With Don Henley and Glen Frey as the major song writers on this effort,you know there had to be some gems.Almost every song ,at least to me has some fine quality.Whether we get another album from them ,which is rather unlikely,this one will last for ages and perhaps,become a \\"classic\\".20 songs,all of which have  the soft and harder edged patented Eagles sound. If you are an Eagles fan,which i'm sure you are,go get this one.It is awesome.<br />4.8 stars for this one.Rock Eagles  solid!!!!!!!!!!!!

0446605409|5.0|Plum Island is the first of several novels by Nelson DeMille featuring retired NYPD detective John Corey, a hard-bitten but humorous protagonist, who definitely does not practice PC in his language or actions. A very fast-paced read, with interesting characters, good and bad. Set on NY's Long Island and the nearby Plum Island, a real-life secret government disease-testing laboratory, both loom large in the story and may hold the answer to the murders of two of the laboratory's scientists. Clever twists and turns, interesting historical and boating information, love and murder abound.

B00005JPS9|4.0|\\"I am Beowulf!\\" roars Ray Winstone in a way that reminded me more than a little of Gerard Butler in `300'.  With his voice resonating like Butler or Nick Nolte and his formidable presence a combination of John Cena and a young Hulk Hogan, Winstone made me think that this epic movie was a cross between Shakespeare and WWF.  Of course the story is pre-Shakespearean, but this hybrid animation rendering of the oldest nugget in British literature has an overall look and feel that elicit even more memories of `Lord of the Rings' rendered through `Polar Express' eyes.    Significantly, `P.E.' director Robert Zemeckis takes on this little adventure gem, and while the dialogue takes many liberties, the mood and action of this story are remarkably intact.  It is a hero epic with all the legend of ancient stories.  We start with King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his subjects in his Norse kingdom celebrating their latest conquests in the most decadent ways, swilling liquor and engaging in all kinds of licentious conduct.  In the middle of their revelry comes a shriek that cracks the evening sky.  The great enemy Grendel, a giant ogre who is presented with great insecurity and menace has arrived and wreaks havoc upon the king's court.  Here it should be mentioned that between his horrendously enhanced appearance and Crispin Glover's Gollum-like performance, a startling adversary is given a great screen presence.      It does no good to spoil the details for the uninitiated, but Beowulf enters upon the scene.  He owes King Hrothgar a debt of gratitude for saving his own father.  Chivalry and courage are vintage aspects and they're not given short shrift here either.  Beowulf falls in love with the Queen, and Hrothgar promises her to him if he can only slay Grendel.  It's not too much to say that he's up to the task, but the battle isn't meant to be missed.   The remainder of the movie studies the aftermath.  Having slain Grendel, pride enters the fray, for now Beowulf must faceGrendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), a seductive siren song who has the power to steer the course of men.      With a golden horn as symbol, 'Beowulf's seduction brings all the ancient themes:  pride and corruption.   `Beowulf' both the story and the movie bring much to the imagination.  Archetypes of heroes and myths are amply presented in good form.  Predating psychology, meeting the enemy in the waters of a cave have a subliminal effect that is mostly rewarding.  Often I found the action startling, a real jolt to my senses.  The only drawback is that I felt there were a few pregnant pauses.  The movie needs to be ponderous and not just play out on fast-forward, but the reflections were sometimes awkward.  While I came upon the non-3D presentation of the movie, I recommend the latter, but I must say having experienced the former, it speaks well of a movie that still works without the full force of 3-D.
0553582445|4.0|I was reluctant to start this series. I read the first series, The Farseer Trilogy, and though I enjoyed them I was left ultimately unfullfilled. I found the endings, pretty much of each book, to be greatly lacking.  I did enjoy the writing, the intrigues, and especially the world and characters.  Thus I decided to skip the Liveship Series and give the same Characters, Fitz, The Fool, etc another chance. I must say that I am glad that I did. This first in The Tawny Man Series was much improved. It was more slow paced then the forementioned books, however it came together nicely in the end.  Robin Hobb has grown along with her characters. They are more thoughtful to the consequences of their actions, and so it appears does she.  I don't understand why this isn't just the fourth book of Farseer Series.  It continues with the same major characters and along the same basic plot overline.  Perhaps Trilogies are more marketable. Do not be decieved this is simply a furtherance of the same Farseer Series 15 years into the future.       There are some plot inconsistencies that I won't point out here, for fear of spoiling.   They are understandable however considering that the narrative is from the first person, and poeple (mere mortals) make mistakes.       I am glad that I gave Robin Hobbs, Fitz and The Fool, another shot. I was impressed with this first in the series and hope for more.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This CD is almost too beautiful for words. The lyrics and music are so unique and heartfelt, you almost feel as if you are intruding on someone else's romance, but luckily, you are not. Damien Rice's music is pure feeling, pure passion.  Delicate is perhaps my favorite track on the CD, followed by the very atmospheric Cheers, Darlin' which is incredibly passionate and haunting.
B000A6T262|4.0|Like all movie collections one must take the good with the bad. Nemesis and Final Frontier are stinkers but they don't drag down the quality of the rest of the films, which range from good solid sci-fi entertainment to spectacular (Wrath of Kahn). This is an excellent collection with all the special editions for each installment.Definatley a great purhase for any Trekkie.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay offers the listener interesting melodies with exquisite harmonic movement.  They take the ubiquitous pop song and with a few simple variations, turn it into something that peeks the curiosity instead of dulling it with the same old tripe that tends to get pumped through the airwaves.  This is a well thought-out recording done by what sounds like thinking musicians.   It is an example of what can happen when musicians actually listen to each other and, in those moments, what the audience is afforded when they do.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Finally they have released this entire show with the proper sound quality! I have been waiting for them to do this for years and I do appreciate the effort. On the negative side however, unfortunately they decided to put the edited songs from the new soundtrack of the movie (done to match the visuals of the film) on to the CD?? This was just plain lazy and insulting. This wasn't even done back in 76!! There should have been no limit to what they could have put on the CDs. They didn't have to match the audio to the film footage so they should have re-mastered the best available performances, in their entirety, from all the available 73 Madison Square Garden shows into one complete show on a 3 CD set! Instead they just did a direct transfer from the re-mastered Movie and new songs on DVD II to the CD in the original running order of the concert (this is why I give four stars instead of five for the CD and Five stars for the DVD). Back in 76 They chose better song versions for the album then what was in the movie because they could, and some of these performances are possibly their very best live versions of some of these songs and far better than the ones on this current CD or DVD (for instance compare this new version CD/DVD to the older version Song Remains the Same CD/Album of Celebration Day which had Page's greatest realized live guitar solo ever for this song and then compare the older audio version of the middle section and Jimmy's guitar passage/solo on No Quarter to this new version. There is absolutely no comparison and this was arguably one of Page's greatest live solos ever-bold statement I know but true- , and the comparisons of whole lotta love from new to the old CD/album is an absolute joke! All of these old versions are now completely lost in this new shuffle as a few examples- Inexcusable!! Hang on to the old CD/Album!) .     This all being said, we must appreciate that Zeppelin is even trying to fix up and put out some of their priceless material officially and with superior sound these days (for profit or not).  So in summary the performances we do have here are different from the ones released in 76.  The new additions are greatly welcomed, the sound is better across the board, However some of these new versions of songs are not even close to as good as the old album versions that were some of the best live Zeppelin realizations of these songs ever and that have now been lost. Overall though we are talking about Led Zeppelin during their peak tour and of some of there best performances ever (proven in detail below!!). This alone will hopefully and finally put these incredible performances in their deserving historical place, perspective and give them their do justice. This brings me to my next important point.     Don't listen to the negative reviewers calling themselves Zeppelin fans. I can tell from what many have written that they don't know Jack squat about Zeppelin or what they were like live throughout their career. They are merely clowns dressed in sheep's clothing wanting to hear themselves talk about something they know very little about (their extravagantly large red floppy shoes give them away).     Led Zeppelin has been my favorite band for the past 29 years and I have read, studied and listened to their entire career (every tour of live performances included) in depth. I will tell you in simple chapter and verse that this show (culmination of shows at Madison Square Garden at the end of their 1973 tour) is incredibly underrated and has been horribly misrepresented and maligned over the years by a few people that are full of hot air. I don't care how many of these sheople/clowns try to say that these were sub par performances (even Page himself has tried to insinuate this for unknown reasons in the past and at other times he has claimed otherwise), I'm here to tell you, as an actually well educated die hard Zeppelin fan, it is absolutely not true!! This has just been self perpetuating opinions over the years from hot winded nobodies that really don't know what the hell they're talking about following along with what a few other people have said before them.     Back in the day (1976 and forward) when this movie and the soundtrack were actually released it was one of the most popular live albums and movies (midnight movies) on the market. It was constantly listened to, watched, talked about and absolutely revered by music heads and fans throughout my junior high and high school days in southern California-all the way into the early eighties (It still played at the Midnight Movie into the early 80's!). I have listened to all the great unreleased live Zep performances and proclaimed greatest Zep shows and I have to yell, from the mountain top to all, that these performances from The Song Remains the Same of: \\"Dazed and Confused (the old album/cd version)\\", \\"No Quarter\\" (the old album/cd version), \\"The song remains the same\\", \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"Celebration Day\\" (the old soundtrack/cd version), \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Whole lotta love (the old album/cd version)\\" and the recent release of \\"The Ocean\\" are still some of the best, if not \\"The\\" best live versions of these songs ever -period!!     To categorically back this opinion up here's a brief, \\"true\\" story, of the actual live history of Led Zeppelin for those who would like to learn a little something:     (1968-1970) Led Zeppelin live from 1968 to 1970 was powerful, fierce, raw and unlike anything that anyone had ever heard or seen. Zeppelin during this time toured around the world constantly, devastating audiences and honing their skills and musical catalog along the way. They were new, hungry and building a loyal live and album (Zeppelin I, II, and III) following as they blew everyone away in their path. However, instrumentally the band was still developing. Plants voice was incredible and the Rhythm engine of Bonham and Jones was amazing and would never disappoint throughout Zeppelin's career yet they were still young and developing their craft. As incredible as Page was at that time he was still in progress as a guitarist, as a musical visionary, in his image/stage presence, and in his eventual forge into musical territory that had never been blazed before. Page was also still in his climb to becoming the ultimate guitar legend/hero and the unequalled technical and most innovative guitar player of his time. This pinnacle wouldn't be achieved by Mr. Page until 1971 and through 1973 (this can be witnessed from unofficial live recordings between 1971 and 1973 or from \\"How the West Was Won\\" 1972). The Concerts from 68 to 70, put into proper historical perspective, are absolutely amazing relative to everything else at the time yet the band as a whole and the material had not reached its next or ultimate level. Page had a vision and he was about to lead himself and this band to greater heights than any guitarist or band had ever achieved.       (1971-1972) Led Zeppelin reached a level of frightening instrumental machinery by 1971. The band members had all honed their skills from countless live performances and non stop touring and recording from 68 onward to the point of perfection as individual musicians and as a cohesive musical unit (Each member of Zeppelin would later be considered one of the very best musicians/vocalists for each of their individual crafts across the board). Zeppelin continued to hone this musical power and devastating musical machinery conquering all audiences in their path around the world during their 71 and 72 tours (as \\"How the West Was Won\\" can attest from 1972 and any other recordings you can find from 71 to 72). This was Led Zeppelin at their instrumental best. Their reputation was larger, their audiences were larger, as was their catalog of styles and songs to choose from (Now touring behind the fourth biggest selling album of all time!!- Zeppelin IV). At this time they had honed their stage presence, their cohesiveness and their individual musical prowess to a point that would never be equaled again in their career. Plants voice reached its peak in this era. He would never sing with as much range, control, power or clarity again and along with Pages peak of sheer virtuosity, speed, fluidity, and confidence of playing they had no equals in the rock world instrumentally during this era. Jones and Bonham never failed as one of the very best rhythm sections in rock throughout the Zeppelin Career. Jones and Bonham were always able to match what was coming from the front men, to play up or play down to whatever was coming from Page and Plant. Zeppelin were four pistons in perfect harmony by 71 - 72 and performances from this era can only be described as ferocious, devastating and mind blowing to audiences around the world. Zeppelin's legend, popularity and live reputation had been solidified here.       (1973) The 1973 tour can only be defined as Superstardom. This tour was huge, electric and the band was revered as nothing short of gods at this time. This was Led Zeppelin riding their reputation of being the most successful rock band in the world in record sales, their recording catalog (now incorporating the great \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), and from their legend as a live act that they had developed through countless tours up to 1972. The 1973 world tour broke box office attendance records and would be the pinnacle of Zeppelin live as far as their stage persona, rock star status/mystique, catalog of albums/songs to choose from, their realization of their live song structures, the size of venues and audiences, and their ability to still be able to capture the tail end of their absolute instrumental power and peak and play at the top of their game. This was Zeppelin at their most electric -The world's biggest rock stars, flying around in their own private jumbo jet to the world's biggest sellout shows and venues. Plants voice had changed by this tour and did not quite have the power, range or clarity of 1972, Jimmy Page at this time was considered the greatest guitarist in the world and the pressure also began to show on him at times during this tour. Though the instrumental machinery had slowed down a bit, the prowess and power was still there for much of this tour.  They were still at the top of their instrumental game more times than not and the band also wielded a bigger legacy, legend, mystique and catalog of albums/songs to choose from.  The band had also refined the set list and the structure of live versions of songs to their most realized and refined at this stage of their live career.  Also, Zeppelin's further developed rock star stage presence/energy of 73 combined with the energy of the 73 audiences was never at a higher level. This magic chemistry mixed with all the reasons given above gives you some of the most satisfying and quintessential Zeppelin performances of all time. When people think of Zeppelin live in the prime of their career, the 1973 version of Zeppelin is what most people envision. Now to my point about the Song Remains the Same.     I have heard many performances from the 1973 tour and there may be shows with more energy or have certain versions of songs that are unsurpassed yet there are truly very few moments from any other 73 Zeppelin shows that rival many of the songs captured at the end of this tour at Madison Square Garden for the \\"Song Remains the Same\\". For instance: Rock and Roll, Celebration Day (the old CD/album version), The Song Remains the Same, The Rain Song, No Quarter (the old version), Dazed and Confused, Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love (the old CD/album version). These are hands down some of the best realized and performed versions of these songs captured live anywhere and from any time-period!       (1975) Led Zeppelin didn't tour again until 1975 (it had been two years!). The Led Zeppelin 1975 tour was a tour of great imagery, mystery and anticipation for audiences that had built Zeppelin up into something beyond legend or even as gods. However, this popularity, the resultant pressure and drug use over the years (mostly by Jimmy and Drinking by Bonzo), and the long lay off from touring had taken its toll on the greatest live band of all time. As Composers and song writers their legacy was still only growing due to their incredible double album released this same year (touring on Physical Graffiti - arguably their greatest album ever), and their imagery from this tour is at times unequalled due to the famous \\"black dragon suite\\" warn by Page, the even longer hair worn by Plant and Page, and the larger stage shows (the first time use of lasers even-a new effect for the time) during this tour etc. However, the band was older, slower and had lost some of its instrumental prowess and pure power machinery that they once had. Plants voice was far removed from the quality it once had only 2 years prior. Page was now battling with a heroin addiction that took its toll from show to show on his guitar playing that only two years prior seemed to be unstoppable and was unequaled from 71-73. This tour was marked by some magic shows that were unfortunately the exception and not the rule at some of their favorite haunts such as Long Beach, The LA Forum, MSG and moments at the end of the tour during their stand at Earls Court in England. Although many magic moments were captured, the shows were instrumentally slower, less technically proficient, and lacked the energy and power that Zeppelin once controlled. Things would never be the same for Led Zeppelin ever again.       (1977) Led Zeppelin toured America for the last time in 1977. Zeppelin hadn't toured since 75 and the lay off again showed more times than not. There were again some magical shows and moments, most notably at certain stands at the bands favorite stomping grounds such as: The LA Forum, Long Beach and Madison Square Garden once again. Their reputation and audiences were larger than life itself at this time. Tragically however, Jimmy Page was battling some serious drug addictions, most notably his heroin addiction. Pages playing could go from close to his hey day of 71-73 to absolutely embarrassing from night to night. There were shows when you wondered if page could even hold up his guitar, much less play it. Plants voice was at times actually better than in the 1975 tour yet the performances as a whole could be shaky with a few high lighted exceptional shows along the way. The band was blowing audiences away at this time from pure reputation and status. Much like the Beatles making audience members pass out without even playing a note back in the 60s. Listening to performances from the 1977 tour, you have to really search to find a few great shows from this tour that can even compare to the power and virtuosity of Zeppelin between 71 and 73. This tour was also cut short due to the tragic death of Robert Plant's son.       (1979-1980) Zeppelin would not play again until they played two warm up shows in Copenhagen Denmark in 1979 in preparation for their two huge festival shows at Knebworth in 79 and then the final European shows in 1980 before Bonham's death. Continued Drug addiction and lay offs only further steered the once mighty Zep downward. Although the band gave it their best effort and put up some very admirable fights (shows), none of these shows can truly compare to the power and devastation these four highly tuned pistons could pump out back in 73 and prior to 70/71.     This brings us back to why these Madison Square Garden shows at the peak of the overall greatest band in the world's career and possibly some of the peaks of the 73 tour itself are so, so priceless and underappreciated. Don't listen to the naysayers (remember, look for their large floppy red shoes) and now go and listen to these treasured performances from the hands down greatest Rock Band of all time with fresh ears, a new perspective and with complete reverence my friends! Maybe in the future we can only hopefor a complete best of performance from the entire stand at Madison Square Garden 73 in a full, uncut 3 CD set. Until that time however, we should all appreciate that Zeppelin is at least finally trying to put some of their priceless, timeless material, that has been locked away and hidden in their vaults for all these many years, out to the public over the past few years. Keep it coming and thank you!
B000VL9XE2|3.0|I'll break this down quick,  it has good moments, bad moments and everything in between. I predict this is the last album they will make worth listening to. But seriously album of the year goes to Tomahawk's \\"Anonymous\\", with Pig Destroyer's \\"Phantom Limb\\" close behind.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|This is the best DVD packaging of any - ANY - Beatles DVD to-date. Period.     The early reviewers below - from September and October - never saw the packaging. I have been critical of recent Beatles re-releases (like Capitol Records' re-release of early Beatles US LPs).     But this ... is great. Coffee table size slipcase (not the DVD size we all know), the entire HELP! script, full-color poster, theatre mini-posters, great full-color 60-page book with great photos, bonus DVD and great sound. For any Beatle fan this is a rockn' holiday gift!  After all folks, this is the greatest rock band in history. Period (based on record sales).     Again, some of the best packaging I have seen in a long time, and the best of any Beatle product. So, worth the price? Absolutely!
B0000026UV|4.0|Besides his guitar virtuosity and song writing (especially lyric) genius, the Englishman, Mark Knopfler, has always had a seemingly innate feeling for the American musical landscape.  He has also paid homage to his guitar heroes, as he does in this album and WITH one of his heroes, Chet Atkins. Recorded in 1990, the album contains American country standards which give both gentlemen the opportunity to show their talents, and both can certainly play the guitar. Knopfler produced the album and sort of \\"allows\\" Mr. Atkins to \\"take the lead,\\" but there's plenty of guitar time for both. This album is a must for fans of Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits, & Chet Atkins.

Ayaan presents insights into the brutal, autocratic and male dominiance of Islam... something all freedom loving individuals should be wary of and grasp the ultimate nature Islamic fundementalism and radicalism.  A great, intense read.  Stronly recommended by all.
B000GGSM76|4.0|This was the first record of The Cure I ever bought. Buenos Aires, 1986, fresh out of high school. I had listened In Between Days on the radio and like it, read praise on the band on some magazines, so I decided to buy the album. I was really surprised by it, songs like Kyoto Song, Close to Me, A Night like This were delicate, sophisticated pop, I have seldom listened to it before (the whole sound would be later appropiated by many indie rock bands). The next year, in 1987, I would be in the famously violent performance Cure did in Buenos Aires, in Ferro Stadium, to present this album. Argentina was a terra incognita for international rock bands back then, and the organizers have underestimated The Cure's appeal, putting the popular tickets in stands that were very far from the stage, and with the view obstructed by one of the light towers. I was in those stands, of course, and before the band even started playing, the people broke the fence and entered the field. What happened afterwards was a pandemonium, in which there were generalized fights, young women were attacked, and some police' dogs were murdered by the irate fans (I didn't see the later, however). The sound was horrible, by the way, which added to the fans fury. Overall, a night one would not forget. And a very good album.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Once again I got it!!!! now I thank an ungratefull Ex for stealing mi Remasters edition a few years ago LOL!!! because now I had an excuse to buy this amazing edition , yeah, yeah!! I know its quite the same , but this edition its even better that Remasters, in packaging, booklet, pics, content, etc. Zep sounds brilliant!!!!!!!! definitelly this album will remain in my car cd player, nothing better than drive listening this four Britts as well as The Beatles.     If you are new into Zeppelin and you look forward to get to know them I recommend this one , shortly youll see yourself purchasing every single album as myself.    Note: my advice is, get this in your car all time    HM
B00000260F|4.0|Flash got bashed by alot by critics & hardcore fans but in reality, it's really not bad at all. If you can get past the dated sound & heavy production, there are actually a few really good songs on it. Especially \\"Ambitious\\", \\"It Gets us all in the End\\" & my all time favorite JB song - \\"People Get Ready\\" which features Rod Stewart delivering some Amazing vocals.  If you like the 80's and enjoy impressive scorching guitar solos, you can't go wrong with this album.
B000002J5K|4.0|You can't go wrong with the Peter Gunn theme, Minnie the Moocher, and Rawhide. Those 3 take you right back into the movie and justify the cost of the CD right there, then the other classics are icing on the cake. Required CD for anyone who loved that cult classic movie.
B000HKWIS0|5.0|Ok, TOS will always seem techonoligically unsophisticated by today's standards.  This remastered version will not fix that.  Just as TNG will eventually seem less sophisticated as time goes on.  But, we should remember that TOS never had the budget and technology that TNG did and this remastered version brings the Original Series up to speed in that matter.  The Enterprise looks awesome and the attention to detail is amazing.  No, I don't think these \\"remastered\\" versions will do much to improve silliness of episodes like \\"Spocks Brain.\\"  However, Star Trek TOS had so many interesting and intellectual episodes especially in this first season.  The only thing, in my opinion that sometimes took away fromt these great episodes had to do with poor special effects.  The Enterprise flying sideways, or bouncing around the screen like it was attatched to a wire (because it probably was!).  This remastered version brings the brilliant special effects that were so acclaimed in TNG and gives that benefit to TOS.  In this way, the special effects add to the story, instead of taking away from it.  And NOTHING is lost.  They haven't messed with, or taken away from these original episodes.  They have only enhanced them.  Hats off to the team who worked on this remastered version!  If you loved Star Trek, you'll love Star Trek Remastered!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|A lot of reviews for this set complain how much it costs. One thing people need to realize is this is an HD DVD/standard DVD set and most combo sets sell for at least $30.00, considering this is a 10 disc set it could have gone for $300 or more. I got mine at Best Buy for 179.99 and it is worth every penny. The remastered picture is perfect and better than I have ever seen in any Star Trek set including the last DVD realeases. I showed my brother and he was amazed at the calrity of the picture also. The redoing of the special effects is also great, it does not take away from the story or ruin it in any way and most of the effects are even shot the same way as they were back in the 60's but redone in CGI to make it look better. For people who feel this is not right need to consider they have ALWAYS wanted to have better special effects but were not given enough money back then to do them, now they have the opportunity to go back and give each episode what it deserves. I also strongly believe Gene Roddenberry would be very proud if he were alive today to see Star Trek done as well as it is.<br /><br />This set also comes with A LOT of bonus features that I am sure will make any Star Trek fan happy. One of the best is the tour of the Enterprise, while it takes a long time to load up it is great to have. I also love the featurrette that tells you how they have updated the series from the 60's to today. The set also includes 5 cards that have pretty cool pictures on the front and on the back it has a list of the episodes and special features on each of the discs.<br /><br />As I stated before this is a great set and to me worth every bit of money I paid for it. It feels like I am watching the shows for the first time. I wish people could get past the price tag on this and see it for how great it actually is. I am looking forward to season 2.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The ncis 4th Series was eagerly awaited and the programmes never fail . The scriptwriters must have excellent senses of humour but the thrills and sppills of intell. work are still there . No problems with the DVD's . However if you are buying from the UK like me you might want to wait for UK release as I was charged £11.99 tax - thats $24 so made this set rather expensive .GRRR.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|Just got done watching the blu-ray version of hairspray I got from amazon.  Looks and sounds even better than when I saw it in the theatre.  Not every movie is worth buying in blu-ray format, but this one is!
B000NPM50A|5.0|This video is great. I had a serious case of constipation, and after a half hour of this I was able to clean out my system.  Thank you Yanni!
0061341029|2.0|This book (actually I listened to the CD version) would have been a useful chapter or two published as part of the original \\"Good To Great\\" book.  Unfortunately, I didn't think that it stood up well on its own.  I was hoping for some sort of \\"aha\\" moment, but this 'monograph' failed to deliver.  Maybe Jim Collins and his team were not able to do the same in-depth research on non-profits as was done on the Corporations for \\"Good To Great\\".<br />Hmmm . . . I was disappointed and thought I overpaid for the relative value I got out of 'Social Sectors'.
B0000DJZA0|3.0|i bought it in october 18, its november 22, and im still waiting for it.  where is it?????????
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Great romantic story with classic Beatles music made this one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|What can you say about Pink Floyd that hasn't been said before. ALthough I had seen clips of this movie done in the early 70's, I only discovered the movie five years ago. Its absolutely amazing, period. If you are a pink Floyd fan, it is as indispensible to your collection as \\"Dark side of the Moon\\". If your not a Pink Floyd Fan, then nothing said here will shake you awake! Telling about all of the historic and archeological sites, the collesieum, the tour of the lava fields....... ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS!<br /><br />The directors cut has some amazing interviews. I love doing reviews, but I hate to be long winded when the issue is simple- Get it, get it, get it.
B000WQW988|5.0|Awesome. I am so impressed with this release. Not only is the sound and picture fantastic, but they have both the original mtv edit of the show and the unedited version of the show. They finally got it right!
B000VNMMRA|5.0|I had more fun at the movies with this than I did watching Transformers and Pirates.    Lets start with the specs. This dvd is reference all the way, the print looks beautiful and the DD 5.1 rocks! There is no DTS track, ignore the Amazon specs.    As for its new \\"unrated\\" status. Lots of added cursing, and a lot more blood splatter/exit wound types of damage. That's it, a very simple upgrade.      I will say that Len Wiseman needs to do a better job with his ADR/looping dept--second unit/insert photographer. There were more than a few scenes where a character was clearly talking and the words were not matching up. I noticed this in the theater. I'm aware principal photography was completed ahead of schedule, but you're not Robert Rodriguez. I don't remember any of the Underworld movies having that problem.     Other than that, which is not a rip on the dvd or movie, I highly recommend you scoop this edition up!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Moral conscience and passion for justice are perhaps the central themes of Amazing Grace. It is a well done film. Educate yourself and others by sharing this film...Enjoy watching this movie full of 'grace'--both content and cinematography-wise.
B000002G7G|5.0|My amazon friend Fin reminded me of this album, and I realised it's the most beautiful of the Velvet Underground's output.  John Cale left the band rather acrimoniously after the White Light/White Heat sessions, and this album (with new guitarist Doug Yule, who I believe is underrated in the eyes of VU fans) came out.  It's a very reflective, introspective album, which is kind of a surprise.  But it's so gentle and beautiful.  The opening song, Candy Says (about Candy Darling, a transvestite who used to hang out with Warhol and his crew), is really lovely.  The rocker What Goes On is a bit of fluff, but it's great fluff.  I love the endless rhythm guitar solo on it.  I adore Pale Blue Eyes.  The song Jesus is uplifting, and it wouldn't be too out of place at a church gathering.  The Murder Mystery is not a particularly good song.  Its concept is very good, but the execution was bad.  Sterling Morrison and Lou Reed read two seperate stories at the same time to a slashing backing track (reminiscent of the White Light/White Heat album, especially The Gift).  It just doesn't work here.  But that song is forgotten about when you hear the wonderful, sweet After Hours.  It's sung by Maureen Tucker, and although she doesn't have a great voice, it works wonderfully for this song.<br /><br />This CD is a different mix than appeared on the box set.  The vocals are turned down, and the guitars are brought up.  I actually prefer this mix to the \\"closet mix\\" that is on the box set.  That emphasizes the vocals over the instruments.  Both are good to listen to, but I just prefer this one.  This is the Velvet's most delicate album.
0953104907|5.0|This book is just amazing, I mean in the very beginning there is a excellently detailed drawing of the cross section of an electric guitar, and even though i'm using it to help build a neck, i will use it to build a full guitar too.
B000059T1E|5.0|Try it you'll like.  It was good when it was released it's great now.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I've been a fan of BSB for almost 10 years now and although within my ten years my music tastes have fluctuated a LOT (for example, I don't listen to a lot of pop anymore) there is still something very nostalgic and comforting with BSB's music.  So if you've always had a liking for BSB, I don't see why you wouldn't now.  Even though their last album, Never Gone, was very good, in my opinion Unbreakable is so far the best because it is most similar to their early days to the album Backstreet Boys.  I love how the BSB always tries to improve but does not ever really change their music style. Though their original album has a lot of horrible oversynthesized pop sounds, it was still fun.  Their last album, Never Gone, still poppy with a lot less of that synthesized stuff and more of a \\"raw\\" sound.  Though their last album was soothing, I missed their fast upbeat songs!  I thought they were famous for it and they didn't bring it! But for Unbreakable they brought it BACK with some of that synthesized poppy sounds but not as cheesy that it would make you feel 15.<br /><br />Once again, a good blend of upbeat and slow songs with normally the same message...having love you can't have, missing somebody, hating somebody...all that can be deemed cheesy, but necessary and best of all comforting.<br /><br />I do have one downer that I would rate a 4 but feel obligated to rate a 5:<br />You can tell the voice aspect of the music is not the same. No Kevin :(  For the everyday non-BSB fan, you can't tell, but for me...I adore each of their voices and  without that deep undertone to their music it's different.  It seems like Nick (whose voice I think has matured so much) sings solo a lot more whereas Brian and AJ has to take over many areas where Kevin would.
B000059T00|4.0|I still remember driving back from the coast through Topanga in a VW at 2 a.m. with my roommate at the wheel, both of us too  stoned to engage in any kind of conversation when this came on the radio. With a good deal of effort Peter who was driving remarked this was just what he needed to hear with his tenuous grip on reality.   Yeah, we made it home, and yeah against all odds we always made it home in those days, some how the world was not so serious then.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|First off, let me be honest--I have NEVER played any of the games. Period. All I know about the games comes from friends who HAVE played it. So this is not a comparison of how the movie stacks up against the games. I don't care about that.     The story makes a lot of sense to me, and I genuinely feel for (most) of the characters. Rose's reactions are very believable when confronted by the nightmares, as are the cop Cybil Bennett's. Cybil is also one of the coolest people I have ever seen in a movie, and if I ever end up in a life-threatening situation, I want someone just like her with me. Awesome character. And I understood why Alessa did what she did, and part of me even agreed with her need for revenge. The first time I watched it, the whole movie was absolutely terrifying--subsequent viewings have cooled the reactions somewhat, but there are still some scenes that scare me every time. The first monster Cybil and Rose encounter...Colin...but the scariest scenes (and the ones I watch the movie for) are the ones with Pyramid Head and the broken nurses. As I have said, I have never seen the games, but I knew who Pyramid Head was/what he did, and I knew about the nurses, but nothing prepared me for seeing them the first time in the movie. Awesome.     I am a horror movie buff, and this is one of my favorites. And it doesn't matter if you have never played any of the games.
B00023BLXK|5.0|this movie was freaking awesome it took me back to the time when the revolution was going on in Cuba.....the whites went to Cuba don't ask me why!!! but anyhow the best part was seeing Patrick Swayze when he was at the ripe age of 80!!! so the movie pretty much is racist because they don't like whites and the whites don't like Cubans... i mean the ending was the best part not the credits well part of it but also that she didn't care if she was going to get an education!!! i mean what is the most important education or being the queen of some club????   the only thing that would spice up this movie is if someone said \\"nobody puts baby in the corner\\"...
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Esta pelicula es sencillamente maravillosa. Sin embargo, el DVD no incluye extras ni entrevistas. Valia la pena incluir algun bonus. De todos modos, por la historia y la excelente represetancion de la epoca, la recomiendo.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|DOWN has really captured the magic once again. \\"Over the Under\\" keeps the hard hittting riffs coming, but they expand their sounds well beyond that. DOWN keep the creativity strong with longer , psychedelic songs, and Phil Anselmo is a helluva SINGER, not just a screamer...and he writes some very strong lyrics. Dig \\"On March the Saints\\", a dig at the way the gov't mishandled their hometown of NOLA after Hurricane Katrina... among many others. Pepper and Kirk do some really interesting guitar work, sometimes layering different parts together to create songs, in addition to the gut wrenching heaviness, without EVER sounding cheap or \\"attempting\\" to sound commercially acceptable.   Best Hard Rock Album of the Year...no question!!
B000WS4P1K|5.0|I don't know what to say since I haven't heard the cd, which is why I left this with a three stars.  John Mayer is an incredible talent, possibly the future of the blues, and Continuum is arguable his best album.  That being said, for the large part of North America who already owns the album (the album sold many copies in both the US and Canada) this is another crappy record company exploitation scheme.  Again encouraging people to start downloading.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|I love this album. Because ýt including  pure rock songs. This Album starting after from fifth song for me. First four song little weak according to other song. However This album listenable for all songs.If I want to rate this album, ýt deserving to 5 star.    My favorite songs; 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. songs. But ýf you want to learn best song for me. Certainly 7. song.    If you like pure rock, buy it. No regret.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I don't know what everyone is going on about this is a very good album, the guitar playing is top notch and the tunes are excellent. They (he) can't simply keep on putting out Siamese Dream rehashed.
0385486804|5.0|I was very moved by Chris J McCandless' story and by the very sensitive and tactful way in which Krakaeur has reported it. The very intelligent, well documented and humble analysis of the character by the author never steals protagonism away from the human adventure and people's emotions. Always keeps in mind what is really at the center of the matter: the hunger for freedom and life meaning.
B000UFAURI|4.0|This is a very good CD! The only really fast song on here is The Pretender, but the other songs still have guitars and rock elements. Go Foo Fighters!
1604590483|5.0|Don't rush thru this one.   Highlighted just about every chapter, there is so much more in here than can be absorbed the first reading.   Powerful, live changing material.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This is a good movie whose story is so important that it raises the movie above its quirks and flaws.  Simply, you should see this movie.  Better, you should read the book \\"Amazing Grace\\" and learn about the real life of William Wilberforce.  However, this movie is a fine place to start.  Yes, the nitpickers can find flaws (starting with the star being much taller than the character he is playing), but they really don't matter so much.<br /><br />William Wilberforce was the son of a very wealthy merchant family from Hull (northern England).  He was an orator of genius and very charismatic.  He had health issues with his bowels for which opium was the only remedy in his time.  His friends were the worldly types such as William Pitt the Younger and the very religious of the dissenter variety such as Isaac Milner and others.  When Pitt was converted and became a committed Christian he felt God had two important missions for him: To lift the lives of the poor and to free the slaves.<br /><br />This movie is not a biography of the life of William Wilberforce nor does aim to tell the whole story of the abolishment of slavery.  It is a picture that tells the story of that part of Wilberforce's life in Parliament that, over a generation, overthrew the slave trade.  While the movie is very impressionistic with the history of the Parliamentary battle, it does get the sense of opposition and hatred across to the viewer.  I found the jumping between the past and the movie's present time and bit confusing because the star, Ioan Gruffudd, doesn't age in any consistent way even though the last triumphant scene took place in 1833 when Wilberforce was out of Parliament and is a conflation of many successes along the way.  There was no single triumph that ended slavery once and for all.<br /><br />Charles Fox was never a Lord and had died in 1806.  John Newton was never the crazed hermit depicted in the movie.  The fiction created to represent him is well played by Albert Finney and captures the anguish and guilt felt by so many in the abolitionist movement for the society that had enslaved so many humans beings, but in no way captured the real life public activism of the former slave ship captain.<br /><br />Still, with the conflations, anachronisms, and outright fictions, you really should learn the name of William Wilberforce.  He was a great and good man who gave his life and fortune to the betterment of mankind.  But don't stop with the movie.  Your life will be enriched by getting to know the real life human being with all his complexity and struggles.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIh and guilt felt by so many in the abolitionist movement for the society that had enslaved so many humans beings, but in no way captured the real life public activism of the former slave ship captain.

B000I2MRHE|3.0|My daughter is now 5 months old and has had this for about 2 months. She's not too thrilled w/it yet but each time I put her on she plays a little bit longer. I think w/in the next few weeks when she has a bit more strength and body control that she'll enjoy it more. I have purchased a baby play mat that has a small U shaped pillow that velcros to it and she definately spends more time on her tummy on that.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I first bought a swivel sweeper about a year ago. I love this product! I've bought several as gifts and everyone loves it (even my \\"hard to buy for\\" dad). One battery charge lasts quite a long time. I probably charge my battery less than once a month and I use the sweeper almost every day. It really does swivel in every direction making it easy to sweep almost anywhere. Both of my children (ages 5 and 3) enjoy using it as well. My son loves to sweep around the house and then see how much dirt he has picked up. As a mom of little ones and a dog, I love that it sucks up cheerios, goldfish and dogfood with no problem. Living in New England without a mudroom, I've found it also comes in handy for picking up gravel, leaves and other such messes. If you have a short-haired pet like I do it is awesome at picking up pet hair. I'm always amazed at how much dog hair I pick up every day. I don't have any plush carpets in my house so this sweeper works on all of my floor surfaces (tile, linoleum, berber-type carpet). I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because my first one did die after 1 year. However, I'm pretty sure it was user error. If you have a long hair or a long haired pet you do have to make sure to clean the brushes in case there is hair wrapped around them. There is a tool that comes with it to do this and it works pretty well. My hair is long now and I wasn't paying attention to the brushes. I got a lot of hair wrapped around them and the sweeper \\"choked up\\". I fixed it temporarily, but it died shortly after. As the title of my review states, I did actually get rid of my regular broom (it may be in the garage somewhere) so after a few days of dirty floors I went out and bought another swivel sweeper because it cleans much better than a broom with less effort. Some reviewers have said that their battery stopped charging. I never had this problem, but I have had other rechargable products that have done this. It's a fairly common problem. Overall, if you're looking for an easy way to clean your floors - you'll love this product. Some online merchants will tell you that this sweeper is not sold in stores, but that's not true. You can purchase it at Linens N Things or Bed, Bath and Beyond. Both stores frequently send out 20% off coupons (they will always take them,even if expired) so you can get the sweeper for less than $30 with the coupon.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Ocean's Thirteen is a good movie.  It's more like the first movie (Eleven) and was 100% better than the second movie (Twelve).<br /><br />The plot centered on a business deal between Willy Banks (Al Pacino) and Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) going bad.  Willy led Reuben to believe he would be his partner in Willy's new Las Vegas Casino.  Willy double-crossed Reuben which caused Reuben to have a heart attack.  Danny Ocean and the guys devised a plan to get back at Willy.  The movie takes us through their plan to ruin Willy by bankrupting his casino.  In the middle of this plan, they run short of money and go to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia from the first movie) to ask for money. Terry doesn't like Willy so he agrees with one condition.  The condition was Danny & the guys have to steal a diamond necklace that Willy has in a display case.  Willy had received this necklace the year before as a prize for winning the Best Casino award.  Terry Benedict wanted to get this necklace because he knew how much it meant to Willy.  A sub-plot was that Danny didn't want Willy to win this year's \\"Best Casino\\" award so they set up a plan to make sure he wouldn't win.  **Spoiler** In the end - Danny & the guys succeeded at bankrupting Willy and stealing the necklace.  Terry Benedict tried to double cross Danny by stealing the necklace from Matt Damon but Danny was ready and the guy stole a fake necklace instead.  Danny donated the real necklace to a charity in Terry's name.  The movie was entertaining from start to finish !
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Maybe it was just my set, but I had some difficulty getting the Star Trek  plastic casing open.  Once inside, the box housing the 10 HD DVDs was dented and scratched.  The plastic disc holders protect all the HD DVDs except for the first one which is exposed.  Because of that, the first disc had some superficial scratches.  Personally, I did not like the packaging at all.    Once I figured out the rather odd menu system, I watched the first episode.   The first thing I noticed was that the colors were far more vibrant than in the unrestored edition. The image was quite clean, although there is a fair amount of grain -- which stems from the original master.  The image is also noticeably dimmer than the unrestored version which tended to be a little washed out.  The reduction in brightness is very apparent but gave it a more vibrant look.  There were only a few instances of specks on the print.  The HD DVD version is just slightly more detailed and clear than the SD counterpart.  There is not a huge difference, however, which is somewhat surprising to me.    The 2.0 audio sounded full.  It lacked the \\"tinny\\" sounds of other older 2.0 audio tracks that I have heard.  I did notice the volume levels were quite low using the True HD soundtrack.  I had to turn up the volume about 20% higher than I usually do. Dialogue was very clear and understandable.      The commentary tracks and the extras are very good.  In fact, I enjoyed viewing the episodes with the commentary on much more than without them.   The amount of time devoted to information and commentary is extensive.    I believe the high price of the set reflects the costs involved in the extras and the restoration efforts.  If you are not interested in the extras or the new digital effects, it would be difficult to justify the price.  On the other hand, if you are a true follower of Star Trek and want not only to view the episodes but also learn large amounts of trivia, it is probably worth the high price.      I would give Star Trek -- The Complete First Season the following grades:    Packaging - 2/5  Menus - 2/5  Picture Quality - 4/5 (HD DVD)  Audio Quality - 3/5  Extras - 5/5    Overall:  3.75/5

It is just mind numbing how much work Paramount has really put into this sucker and the result is nothing short of spectacular. George Lucas could really learn a thing or two from Paramount and how they have handled upgrading this set. I have now had a chance to really sit down and spend a couple days with this sucker and it really is drop dead amazing. I never would have ever believed that Star Trek TOS could look so good and still retain all of the qualities that made it the huge phenomenon that it was. Paramount needs to be commended for not only what they did but also for what they didnt do and thus keeping the overall feeling of the show the same.<br /><br />For those that are complaining about the price, you obviously dont remembr how much these episodes were when they first appeared on SD DVD, and those didnt have any of the scanning, retouching or special effects work done to them that this set does. Considering that this set uses the HD DVD Combo or Hybrid disc and considering the amount of work that Paramount has put into these episodes and the special features that comes with the set, its actually a surprise that they arent more expensive especially given the high prices the Star Trek series has always commanded even on SD DVD. If this price is still too high for you simly wait 9-12 months before picking it up. Everyone knows tat prices on these things continue to drop the longer they are out. Simply be patient and buy other things in the mean time and a few years down the road you will be able to pick up the entire TOS series on HD DVD and for much cheaper. Those like myself that cant wait and have no problem paying this price, BUY IT and BUY IT NOW!!! Its just a stunning release right down to the package design. You wont be disappointed!!<br /><br />As for the people that keep calling HD DVD dead or keep saying to wait until Paramount comes back over to Blu Ray. Keep dreaming. That 18 month figure that alot of BD supporters are throwing around is 100% FUD and was started by some Blu Ray sites that I wont even mention here. The bottom line is you wont find a single soruce on the web backing that 18 month figure up and even Paramount themselves have come out and said that the move to HD DVD does not have a time limit on it and they have no plans to ever support Blu Ray again. As for HD DVD being dead, considering they just sold 100,000 players in a 2 day period and we havent even gotten to Black Friday yet, Well lets just say that anyone who thinks this war is over is simply a fool who is either so blinded by his loyalty to a particual side of this war that its clouding thier judgement or they simply have zero understanding of these markets and of format wars in general. The fact that HD currently only represents 6% of the total market is all anyone needs to look at to see that neither of these formats has won anything and that 94% of the market still has yet to decide what they are going to do.<br /><br />The bottom line is quit listening to all of the FUD spead on these boards by people whos obvious intention is to sway your purchasing dollars one way or the other and let common sense settle back into your heads. Neither of these formats is going anywhere anytime soon so stop worrying about it and enjoy some HD while the powers that be duke it out and what better way to enjoy HD then to pick up this amazing first season of Star Trek TOS. The previous releases of this show are so pathetic by comparison that I sit in awe at what an amazing job Paramount has done. I am so impressed by this series that I am buying 2 more of them for gifts ths christamas for my nephew and uncle whoare like myself big fans of the show.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for, buy this sucker already!!! You wont be disappointed.e show.    So what are you waiting for, buy this sucker already!!! You wont be disappointed.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|This Flash edition is the best, all elements in the film works excellent. But the music quality and performance is out of this world (if you have a home theater the experience will be 120% or more), Queen is Queen without any doubt!

I found myself feeling for the characters so much mor than in his past novel.  I enjoyed the look inside the culture of Afghanistan and its people.  Very Insightful!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's got to be the biggest blunder in TV history to have mistreated this TV series the way the Fox network did.  First they started with The Bank Robbery episode, skipping the pilot which introduced each of the nine main characters and how they got together on Serenity (spaceship). That would have made steadfast viewers for the long stretch.  Then they changed time periods, etc. and then prematurely cancelled the show.  I love Buffy and Angel but I like Firefly even more.  When the Twin Towers went down on 911, the psychologists said that everyone was tuning in \\"comfort\\" shows.  I was watching \\"I Love Lucy\\" reruns.  But the last few years I would watch Buffy or Angel whenever I was under extreme stress.  Now it's Firefly.  It's now my number one comfort show when things aren't going well.  I've watched it over and over and I don't think it will ever get old or boring.  I can't wait for Joss Whedon's new series \\"The Dollhouse\\" coming sometime soon on Fox. But I would rather it had been the continuation of Firefly.  I'm still waiting for the Second Season of the best TV series ever made.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Without doubt Hans Zimmer is the man when it comes to making Pirates Of The Caribbean sound tracks.  The third (maybe final installment of Pirates) brings us new locations which Hans gives new music to go with the flow with scene.  Giving clips from previous sounds scores of Pirates are nicely done remixed into this sound track.  Up Is Down is very wittly giving Jack Sparrow giving him the musical tune that makes us laugh whenever I see him.  My personal favorites are Up Is Down, Now I Don't Think Is The Best Time (final 5 minutes of the track),One Day-A nice way to describe William and Elizabeth romantic scene. Drink Up Me Hearties Yo Ho for it's musical conclusion to the Pirates trilogy.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Even though I'm not a golf fan, this is one of the finest films I've seen. Besides all the creative technicalities, the perfect casting and wonderfully gifted acting didn't need the film's special effects to carry them through this winner. My hats off to all who were a part of this movie. It proves, once again, that hype isn't needed when true talent is involved.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|First of all.., i have no idea where are those critics comes from. Maybe 'the others' watched it differently, but being a crazy vivid LOST fan i am, i totally think that, there are nothing wrong on the first 6 episodes, yes, there were more suspense added, but it just kept me guessing and put on my own theories.., thus, i love the way the show present the plots.<br /><br />To me, the more mystery the show deliver, the merrier, it will make this show more unique with alot of question raises and more and more debates on those questions.

B000UR9T82|4.0|This set was great - as soon as I got it I called people over and watched Spiderman 3.  It's a little hokey, yes, but it looked so good that no one even cared.  The picture is spectacular, the sound is great, and the price wasn't bad at all (around $60).  I'd definately recommend this to anyone interested in getting the movies.  I'll never buy another regular DVD again!  Upconverting is for chumps - get BluRay and never look back!
B00063F8B2|4.0|I really enjoyed this cd.  Music is crucial in my life and I have always loved this story.  It is a nice compilation of new orchestral compositions as well as what some of us might consider traditional Christmas music.  I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to adding this cd to my music collection.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I have trouble getting into books, but when I do, I want to be submerged in it and have it for as long as possible. World Without End is one of those books. I read Pillars of the Earth over 10 years ago and remember what a wonderful book that was and how painful it was for me to finish it. I wanted it to keep going. World Without End achieves the same thing and I did not want it to stop. It's a page turner for over 1000 pages. I've read a bunch of Ken Follett's books, but not all of them. Many of them are my favorites, but I'm going to go out and buy the rest. He's incredible.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|another great cd by Brad Paisley.  he has a great sense of humor and puts them in his songs.  love this cd,

B0006A9FKA|5.0|While Shaun stumbles through his life (and we witness many others stumbling through theirs) in a daze similar to that of the \\"undead,\\" around him the world is slowly collapsing into horror as zom- oops, I mean, the \\"z word\\" take over the world.  Satirical and funny, scary and touching, this movie has it all (including a GREAT soundtrack!).  At first Shaun is too focused on his own problems to notice anything else around him - his girlfriend is dissatisfied with their relationship, because all they ever do is go to pub (the Winchester) in the evenings with their respective roommates, and they never do anything together.  Also, he is stuck in a dead-end job where, even when he is put into a position of authority when everyone else calls in, no one treats him with respect.  His mother is the type who refuses to see the bad around her, while his stepfather is just . . . creepy.<br /><br />Using the slow take-over and Shaun's complete unawareness of it as a point of showing how little we tend to pay attention to the world around us, and doing so in a darkly humourous way was a definite hit.  Once Shaun realizes what is happening, he decides what to do and sets out to do it - basing his entire decision on making certain he gets his mother and his girlfriend to some type of safety and not really considering carefully before choosing the pub that perhaps the zombies could break the glass in the windows (of course, the zombies didn't need to, since whats-his-knob, that blue-nosed son-of-a-pumpkin, broke them first).<br /><br />At any rate, I loved it and this movie earns a definite YES YOU MUST SEE IT from me!
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This little disc, slipping under the radar, has to be Angleo's masterpiece. Such a wide gamut of emotions. It instantly just takes me back 17 years. Well worth the wait.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Our oldest relative received a quadruple by-pass and none of us have ever had any problems with insurance, so I began the movie somewhat sceptically.  I was won over fairly quickly after that.  This is the \\"new new\\" Michael Moore, and as an estranged moderate Reblican, I attest to his value to the center.  This is a very thoughtfully put together movie, very artful in combining interviews and news clips, and I now see the depth of despair that hits those disqualified by mendacious insurance comapnies.  With the help of this movie, I now understand medical math: keep the middle happy, and screw over the poorest of the poor who fall into that smaller category of \\"catastrophically expensive\\" medicine.  In essence, the medical industry is practicing genocide/medical triage, based on income and cost, not on need.  Now that *should* be a crime.<br /><br />He opens with Ronald Reagan, one of my personal heros, and thus disconcerting to see \\"selling\\" the concept of socialized medicine to create the hospital industry.  I lunch regularly with Jim Turner, #2 Naderite who continues to do for health and food what Nader did for cars, and we talk often, not about whether health should be nationalized and universal, which we think it should, but rather about why the American Medican Association continues to focus exclusively on profitable remediation and drugs, does everything it can to conceal and drive out of business those who offer natural and alternative cures, and ignores completely the benefits of preventive medicine in the form of healthy life style and healthy environment.<br /><br />He opens his damnation of Congress by pointing out that as a Senator, Hillary Clinton was bought--her silence was bought--for $800,000.  That is one reason I think Senator Obama contrasts so  well with her: Mrs. Clinton is \\"old partisan polkitics,\\" Ron Paul and Barack Obama are \\"new transpartisan citizen-driven\\" politics.<br /><br />I have four pages of notes on this movie.  I took it seriously, and I will also watch John Q now, a movie I avoided despite the great stars.<br /><br />The obscene costs of medicine are dramatically illustrated, and in one case, a person is told they can choose which of two fingers to attach, one for $40K the other for $60K.  That really IS sicko.<br /><br />The middle part of the movie is a superb review of Canadian, British, and French medicine and may have included Nordic as well.<br /><br />He returns to the US, and to point out how our current health care system has been manipulated for profit and shielded from excellence by the AMA, asking--very intelligently and pointedly--why we have such excellent police, firefighters, and teachers who are \\"provided.\\"  He's right.  The AMA and Mrs. Clinton are wrong.  We need to follow the French/Cuban models (more on that at the end).<br /><br />There are some sensational and intellectually satisfying interviews in this movie.  A couple of highlights:<br /><br />+ Labor Leader in UK: US is willing to spend trillions killing others, why not spend billions healing its own?<br /><br />+ UK doctors get substantial bonuses for improving the health of their assigned sector.<br /><br />+ Giving poor the vote led to the corruption of Congress.<br /><br />+ People who are healthy, educated, and confident are harder to govern.  Both Wall Street and Washington *want* \\"working poor\\" and \\"fearful populations.  TIME TO END THAT.<br /><br />+ Corporations use health benefits to enslave and discourage movement.<br /><br />+ Keiser will deny coverage if the individual--not matter how acute their condition-refuses or cannot get to a hospital *owned* by Kaiser.  THAT ought to be criminal.<br /><br />+ France, by the testimony of Americans living there, is the most family-friendly country on the planet, down to providing mother's helpers so mothers can have two four hour blocks during the week to care for their house and husband without concern.<br /><br />The movie documents the scandalous misbehaviorof Los Angeles hospitals of \\"dumping\\" patients, dressed only in a thin hospital gown, by taxi in the vicinity of but not directly in front of a rescue mission for the homeless.  I watched this on security video in horror.<br /><br />He then moves into 9/11 health aftermath.  I personally believe that President Bush is impeachable on a number of counts, but supressing the extreme danger of the asbestos released by the controlled demolitions of the three buildings (Larry Silverstein's dream--conspire with insurance companies to empty the building of insured gold, get a portion of the seven billions to reconstruct the WTC after it is brought down and cleared at taxpayer expense....  In my lifetime, we will see the truth come out about Bush, Cheney, Guliani, Rumsfeld and others who have disgraced our Nation--lying to the firefighters and the citizens of New York is one reason I consider Rudy \\"scoop and dump\\" Guliani to be toast.<br /><br />The movie moves to a close by discovering that terrorists being held captive at Guantanamo receive the best of medical care, free, at our expense, at the same time that 9/11 workers go begging.  There is a dramatic staged effort to reach Guantanamo via boat, then they suddenly appear in Cuba, probably via jet arranged in advance with the Cuban government.<br /><br />The movie closes with the 9/11 firefighters receiving the best free treatment on the planet, and being honored by Cuban firefighters who come to attention for them.  I was moved on a number of fronts.<br /><br />First, Cuba and the Amish have the only sustainable agricultural practices on the planet;<br /><br />Second, Cuba can afford to send 10,000 doctors to Venezuela for a prolonged period, and we cannot take care of our own.<br /><br />Third, my libertarian roots vis a vis the Federal Government are reinforced.  This is a government that makes war and betrays the trust of the American people, and I hold BOTH the Democratic and Republican partisan machines to blame.  We need Electoral Reform to include an end to the \\"winner take all\\" nonsense.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  On Monday I will be sending Michael Moore a fax outlining the Earth Intelligence Network model for healing the planet.  The model starts with the ten high level threats to humanity, among wich poverty (caused by government and industrial corruption), disease, and environmental degradation outrank war, the twelve policies (agriculture, diplomacy, economy, education, energy, family, health, immigration, justice, security, society, and water), must be addressed not just for the US and Europe, but for the eight challengers as well (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and Wild Cards like Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey).

As a former spy who is also an honorary hacker, a regular speaker at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) (the movie [[ASIN:B000WXEGLO Hackers]] and a participant in Hackers of Silicon Valley and occasionally Hac-tic in Europe,  I consider this movie the infrastructure equivalent to [[ASIN:B0002MB7QW The Day After Tomorrow (Full Screen Edition)]] Bottom line: the US Government at the political level is totally corrupt and impeachable for betrayal of the public trust going back to 1975 when peak oil was ignored, 1985 when water scarcity was clearly understood, and 1990 when Winn Schwartau, Peter Black and I and several others warned of the vulnerability of all electronic systems.<br /><br />There is one MAJOR error in the movie: the SCADA systems that control all our utilities (electricty, natural gas, oil, water) are NOT isolated from the Internet, and the Homeland Security Committes in Congress are freaking out over this as I write this.

Every single system we have can be hacked, the Chinese brought Vice President Cheney down over Singapore as a demonstration of their ability to fry any US missile, airplane, tank, or destroyer.<br /><br />This movie is an utterly superb rendition of the incompetence and malfeasance of the US Government at the political level, and I am going to add it to my list of serious DVDs for that reason.<br /><br />The scenario, where the whistleblower gets crucified by the government instead of listened to, is all too familiar to me.

I've decided to do a very long review, as this is one of the most important books I have read in the last three years.<br /><br />Bottom line: asset managers should focus on consequences, which can be known, rather than probability, which you cannot know.<br /><br />Black Swan events are unpredictable, have a massive impact, and after the fact are \\"explained\\" in a manner that leads people to believe \\"if we had only known X, we could have predicted.\\"<br /><br />The author says that both 9-11 and Google are Black Swans.  On 9-11, I think the author overlooks both the fact that it *was* predicted by the Hart-Rudman Commission, but I will delete other commentary in order to allow all of us to focus on this specific book and its huge importance.<br /><br />On Google, the author is assuredly correct.  No one could have foreseen that small investors would be so enthused by Google that today they are earning $1 for every $10 million in small investor cash they spend.  No Wall Street firm would ever have made that mistake.  Google may also be the first tri-fecta Black Swan, next and second, by devastating Wall Street when it consumes the banking, communications, entertainment, computer storage, and publishing industries (five years out, see the analytic study, \\"Google 2.0: The Calculating Predator\\" but if you don't find it via Google, use another engine--they are known to be manipulating what people see); and then third, when its computational mathematics, undocumented and without regulatory oversight, crashes unexpectedly and takes the economy down with it (ten years out) or, equally possible, every person on the planet uses CISCO AON to put the Googleplex out of business, and human social networks scale to the point that math is left behind.<br /><br />This is quite an amazing work of pragmatic scholasticism.  I am seriously impressed, and believe that this book is most valuable to the managers of asset portfolios, hedge funds, and pension funds.  As the author himself notes, portfolio managers tend to exclude \\"Black Swans\\" as a risk.<br /><br />In the author's view, Platoicity (Plato's Cave) mistakes the map for the terrain.  I have found this problem endemic in the secret intelligence world, which would rather believe a satellite than a human on the ground.  To illustrate the point: in one instance, the human reported an operational temperature of X and the satellite said Y.  It turned out the satellite has been programmed to average the three different temperatures.  It is that kind of mistake, buried deep in Google's computational mathematics, that should be scaring everyone to death right now, and especially Amazon, Apple, CISCO, IBM, Oracle, SAP, Motorola, and Nokia, not to mention banking and publishing and Hollywood.<br /><br />The author, of Greco-Syrian descent from Levantine (he shares the disdain of Philip Atlee in [[ASIN:0521016800 The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State]] for the concept of a nation-state, and I share his affection for Lebanon], tells us that the Earth requires us to have more imagination and not limit ourselves to what we can \\"see\\" and to historical extrapolation.<br /><br />The triplet of opacity:<br />01 Illusion of understanding<br />02 Retrospective distortions<br />03 Overvaluation of factual information<br /><br />He does not add corruption and other impeachable or indictable offenses that are all too common on Wall Street and in the White House as well as Congress.  His crisis scenario is strictly objective and assumes good character among all concerned.<br /><br />He says, \\"History and societies do not crawl, they make jumps.  They go from fracture to fracture, with a few vibrations in between.\\"<br /><br />He says that other than diaries, which are true history as seen at the time by the subject, all history is absurd or biased, with clustering, categorization, and simplification, not to mention cultural and other biases.<br /><br />He learned at Wharton directly from the most powerful CEOs on the planet that they literally do not know what is going on in the world (p. 17)<br /><br />While the author worries about the highly improbably consequential event, I worry about the high probable consequential event that our political and economic elites refuse to acknowledge: Las Vegas running out of water, Exxon failing to invest in a five year Marshall Plan to cut oil needs in half, the elimination of chlorine, mercury, the restoration of Iowa corn to people instead of cattle, and so on.<br /><br />Fascinating discussion of quant and platonic folds, by his own description a mix of mathematics, engineering, and statistics.<br /><br />He concludes that we suffer from an inbred psychological and biological blindness, and I was pleased to see in the footnotes his recognition of E. O. Wilson, who in [[ASIN:067976867X Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]] answered the question: \\"Why do the sciences need the humanities?\\"<br /><br />Black Swan is induction.  See also Don Beck on abduction, [[ASIN:1405133562 Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership and Change]].<br /><br />+ Asset managers must be able to recognize cosmetic profits (or in the case of Google, cash outflow disparities in relation to cash inflow), and to discover hidden risks, e.g. in the case of Google, the forthcoming demise of the companies iterated above, and banks, if the current economic leaders do not come together and bring Google to the table in a deeper more candid manner than is now the case.<br /><br />+ Empiricists without philosophers are dangerous, and vice versa.<br /><br />Five sources of blunders:<br />01 Focus on pre-selected data<br />02 Fool ourselves<br />03 Human nature not programmed to imagine Black Swans<br />04 History hides many Black Swans, he calls this \\"silent evidence.  See also [[ASIN:1560257679 Fog Facts : Searching for Truth in the Land of Spin (Nation Books)]] and [[ASIN:1893517004 Lost History: Contras, Cocaine, the Press & 'Project Truth']]<br />05 We tunnel, focus too narrowly.<br /><br />The author is consistent with, but does not reflect, the Natural Capital Institute work on \\"true cost,\\" which corporations externalize by burning future sustainability for current profit.  Consumers are now becoming aware, and I believe that \\"true cost\\" information delivered to the cell phone at the point of sale is going to change entire industries within five years.<br /><br />+ We are 22 times too comfortable with what we know or do not know<br /><br />+ Information is bad for knowledge.  This is correct, but the author might enjoy a discussion about commercial intelligence (legal ethical decision support) in which tailored intelligence can kill a $5 billion deal or buy a future $10 billion value for $100 million.  Since I founded OSS.Net in 1992, I have been saying that \\"Information costs money, Intelligence makes money.\\"  I believe that much good could come from merging the author's gifted analytic model, and the one that I have which studies the ten threats, twelve policies, eight global challengers, and also dissects indigenous environments along political-legal, military and law enforcement, socio-economic, ideo-cultural, technical-demographic, and natural-geographic.  There are no short cuts in the commercial intelligence business, but there *are* very rewarding insights that all the others miss because they fail to \\"cast a wide net.\\"  See [[ASIN:0971566119 The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption]]<br /><br />I *really* like the author's discussion of false versus real experts.  The government recruits experts based on their clearances, associations, locality, and convenience.  I find experts based on citation analysis, direct examination, and referral  What really grabbed me was the author's explicit inclusion of both stock traders and CIA intelligence analysts as false experts (p. 146).  I am reminded of flying back from the Middle East with a World Bank executive for Africa who told me that the CIA analysts visiting him were young and inexperienced, and \\"they put forward hypotheses that are frightening in their ignorance.\\"<br /><br />The author quotes Bacon, saying most important advances are those \\"lying out of the path of the imagination.\\"  This is one reason I made \\"Cast a Wide Net\\" one of the rules for the new craft of intelligence.  We need to be doing all information in all languages all the time, going back into history (e.g. tracking every Chinese statement on the Spratley Islands for the past 100 years).<br /><br />He works from Hayek, who believes that a true forecasting system is done ORGANICALLY by a society or system, and that one single institution, neither CIA nor Google, can aggregate knowledge.  I have been saying since 1992 that in the age of distributed information, \\"central intelligence\\" is an oxymoron.  Same same Google.<br /><br />I am provoked by the author into reflecting that while we cannot predict the future, we can shape it, and in choosing to obsess on secrecy, scarcity, war, and money, we have forsaken all we could have done by waging peace.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|Very rarely is a remake of a Beatles song made that is actually worth listening to, and yet this album presents two discs packed with cover versions that are typically just as good, if not sometimes a little better (I know- blasphemy) than the Beatles' version. An amazing gospel version of Let It Be, a fantastic bluesy/soul Come Together, and a solid rocker version of I Am the Walrus featuring Bono come to mind as some of the highlights, but the harmonies and womens' voices in pieces like Because and Dear Prudence truly provide a breath of fresh air to the beloved originals. Pick this album up, give it a listen, and check out the movie for added beauty and a new context for the music... You won't regret it.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Backstreet Boys return after 2 years with another qulity cd.  I love this cd, every track rocks, to me it's way better then \\"Never Gone.\\" I've listened to this cd already 50 times and didnt get bored of it. BSB are here to stay!!!!!
B000EWBKM6|5.0|If you can only afford to buy one of \\"Will and Grace's\\" DVDs, this is the one to get. It is a great wrap up to a great series. They did a great job. It is a tribute to friendship, to \\"The Circle of Life\\" and FUNNY on top of that. Get it, worth every penny. If you can get others, go ahead, but this you will be so glad you own and can watch.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I bought my first CD of Josh's \\"Closer.\\"  I can only say that I am now addicted to this singer. Whether he sings his songs in English or in a foreing language, just to hear his voice is something I want to do all the time. Get this CD or any of his CDs. You will love it like I did. Hopefully, he is going to  always be putting out new CDs. Josh G. is going to be one of those singer's that I will continue to listen to for the rest of his career and long to see in concert.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is one of those bittersweet comedies that catches your attention right away and holds your attention quite well. The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a particularly dysfunctional family on a mission: Their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) has been chosen to be a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent contest. Her parents, Richard and Sheryl Hoover (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette) decide to indulge their daughter and take her to the show. Along for the ride, both literally and figuratively, are Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin). Look also for Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who refuses to talk because he loves Nietzsche.<br /><br />Things aren't easy for the Hoover family. Richard's motivational \\"nine step\\" program won't sell and the family is losing practically all their money in the process; and Richard's father does heroin when nobody's looking just to get through the day. Dwayne wants to fly jets even after he discovers that he's colorblind; and Frank wallows in a type of self-pity depression because his male lover left him and he wasn't awarded the number one Proust scholar in the nation.<br /><br />Of all the characters, however, little Olive holds out the most hope. She's nervous but she really thinks she just might win the talent contest and be crowned Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />Will Olive be crowned Little Miss Sunshine? What happens after their ancient, rapidly decaying VW bus gets a broken clutch and a broken horn? Will they get to the contest in time? Will they all get there in the first place? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The cinematography is rather fine; I liked the scenes of the countryside as they traveled in their VW bus; and the scenes of the talent/beauty contest reflect good judgment. The choreography shines through in scenes where the little girls all compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a commentary by the directors and there is another commentary with both the screenwriter and the directors. There are four deleted ending scenes that also have optional commentary. In addition, one side of the DVD presents the movie in widescreen while the other side of the DVD presents the movie in full screen format. Impressive for a single DVD release!<br /><br />Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is fantastic entertainment. Funny at times, sad at times, the film never loses its focus. Some people may say that it tries too hard to please but I didn't pick up on that; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The movie is rated R so I would caution parents not to let young children watch this movie.<br /><br />Great job, everyone!.

0385522401|4.0|This book captured my full attention for two days.  It's a very short read.  At times I found my self cringing at some of the senes and wanting to stop and interrupt the characters and give them \\"my\\" advice.  Ha!  What a sad ending, but true on so many levels.  I recommend reading this book and contemplating it's ending, over & over again.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney's much heralded comeback delivers in a big way. The hot dance beats accompanied by Britney's trademark sensual vocals make this album possibly one of the strongest of 2007. Britney's sound has matured and keeps getting better over time. Well done Brit!
0553805460|1.0|Reading this book reminded me of how shallow I used to think, live, and be.  In that sense I can relate, but don't appreicate.  The author obviously does not care a wit about anyone other than himself, and his measure of all things is reduced to dollars.  What I have, what I got, the beautiful wife I own.  Oh please.  I'd rather read the peanuts comic strip, or even dilbert.  I found his writing to be boring, two-dimentional, and self-serving.  Never in the book does he substantiate, or describe how he was a \\"wolf\\".  Kinda like hollywood films that take well known words, concepts, beliefs and build a movie around them...all assuming we know what a \\"wolf\\" is and don't need any drama to back it up.  Save your money and your time and skip this one!
B000V8I2QU|2.0|This could have been a 5 star effort. The audio engineering on this CD sounds like it was done by a person with severe hearing damage. Maybe Bruce engineered it himself. Have all those many years of high volume concerts and studio jamming damaged Bruce's hearing? It can best be described as distorted and abrasive. The songs are SO good that it hurts to know what could have been. I find it amazing that this product could even make it to the stores like this. Mr. Springsteen, thank you for these very wonderful songs - FIRE your audio engineer!
B000VI70WM|4.0|Of course the lead story for \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" has to be the involvement of \\"hot\\" \\"current\\" outside producers, but the real story is the full engagement of Mr. LeBon. No (self-contained) act can sell a reported 85 million records or last three decades without solid songwriting, yet the music press has bestowed precious few compliments historically upon the band's memorable melodies. As lead vocalist performing group-penned material, Mr. LeBon deserves credit for creating pop melodies that have, in many cases, stood the test of time. In the band's career valleys, his contributions have felt disengaged, seemingly contented with (life)style over substance, but \\"RCM\\" finds the musician, certainly scratching the half-century mark, in peak form. \\"Falling Down\\" is a near-perfect example of the pop song art form- lyrics emotive and vulnerable while retaining a modicum of intrigue, gift-wrapped in sing-along melody. (This often-obtuse lyricist discovered the vulnerability goldmine with the band's second-best composition, 1992's \\"Ordinary World,\\" not coincidentally an enormous success.) Though nowhere else on the new release do the pieces fit together so magically, there are many other moments to be witnessed: a millenial Dylan-esque liner about \\"Google-dirty fingers;\\" delivering Hitchcock-ian tension in \\"Dirty Great Monster,\\" a song about addiction...or perhaps even incest; and a father sweetly promising to be \\"fighting in\\" his daughter's \\"corner,\\" so much more real and responsible than offering to take her pain away. And this limited vocalist is extremely confident throughout, even when, as in some of the band's best moments over the years, his melodies threaten to breach the ceiling of his range. It is in this service of melody- refusing to compromise the soaring promise for fear of cracked notes (say, at Live Aid)- that Mr. LeBon is at his best, and why \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" succeeds. While J. Taylor seems energized, his bass work sounding as close to the work that influenced a generation as we have heard in awhile, Mr. Rhodes' producer's ear (and eye) keenly focused on quality assurance, and, oh yeah, some guys named Timbaland and Timberlake heavily influencing a few rhythm tracks, the project works ultimately on the strength of it's melodic conviction, as it should.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This was easily one of the best films of the year; it was original, engrossing, visually stunning, thought provoking, and unpredictable--an amazing movie!  What's equally amazing, though, are the reviews here on Amazon.  But then again, I guess it shouldn't be that surprising, since these are the same people responsible for the \\"successful\\" careers of Rob Schneider, Queen Latifa, and Kevin Costner.<br /><br />If you don't mind using your brain when watching a movie, then I highly recommend \\"Children of Men.\\"  But don't take my word for it - check the reviews on IMDb, and RottenTomatoes, and MetaCritic, and the 3 Academy Award nominations...
0440296080|5.0|This book is a classic.  To be fair, it is a bit out-dated.  Internship is not quite what it used to be....but many of the stories still ring very true.  And, in any event, it is a great read in its own right.  If you really want to know what internship is like, get \\"Hospital Survival: Lessons Learned in Medical Training\\" by Grant Cooper. But, for pure entertainment and a look at how internship was in the 1970s-80s, read House of God.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|It most be remembered that F. Scott Fitzgerald was a brilliant novelist and short story writer, but an abysmal screen-writer when he was in Hollywood.  Fitzgerald stuck to depressing realism.  Yet movies work on sympathetic characterizations.  The audience must like the characters.  The characters should evoke our empathy.      Redford, Farrow, Dern were great at capturing the characters as written in the novel.  But they weren't compelling enough for a movie.  They didn't evoke empathy and were not likeable characters.  It works in a novel, but not on film.  Or to make it work on film, they needed additions to what the novel provided.      Another great lack was a question of chemistry.  It is hard to conceive of Redford character (because on film that's what the character amounts to) laboring under a lost idealistic love for the Daisy portrayed by Mia Farrow.  The two \\"film\\" characters lacked believable chemistry and were pitifully boring together in their scenes.  Therefore, the writing of the film script should have surpassed the novel.  Maybe Faye Dunaway as Daisy would have been a better choice.  Dunaway is an actress capable of passion, superficiality and she is well capable of leaving us with a chill.  Whereas Farrow's Daisy came off as merely a loser in the marriage stakes, bored with her life and accepting Gatsby's adoration in desperateness to find an escape from her life.  Yes, true to the novel, but not enough to carry off the underlying points that Fitzgerald had conveyed in writing.  It wasn't only who Daisy was but also how life made her.  Farrow's Daisy was too murky and at points wishy-washy without plausible cause.

1416523359|4.0|The story starts as a typical ghost story, Lisey's dead husband contacts her to warn her of impending danger, but then the plot becomes more complex.  Lisey's psychotic sister deteriorates, a mysterious threatening caller stalks, and Lisey suspects there may be deeper connections between her emerging memories and seemingly random events. It was a good page turner, and makes an easy read.  Characters are interesting, especially Lisey herself, who grew from a loving, but passive, at times neglected wife/widow into the independent heroine. Solid King novel.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is a wonderful movie! With an original plot, and the suspence mode that it will have you in from beginning to end is an awesome rush! I say buy it. Everybody that I know loves this movie, and hopefully you'll like it also! It's a great installment to anyone's collection.
0783240236|3.0|I watched this again, having seen it the first time many years ago, and since then, seen many superior Hitch films. I know 5 star reviews for Hitch are automatic for some, but did you pay attention at all? Even someone with a slight eye for quality could tell there is something very off about this film.    Suspension of disbelief = There was none. Highly implausable choices by characters. Ex. We're inside, let's run OUTSIDE and get somewhere safer! Let's get the children out of here! Let's take them OUTSIDE! Tippi Hedren's character looks into the upstairs room, sees all the birds, and THEN slips INTO the room. WHAT? And Cathy with the stupid Lovebirds, can we bring them Mitch? Can we take them in a tiny, FABRIC TOP convertible to make our escape. There were two other vehicles with hard-tops in this movie.    Cathy's monologue after being rescued from the schoolteachers house was just heavy handed and artificial.    Why Hitch? Was it the studio? Did they have your children at gunpoint?
B000LXH11C|5.0|Along with [[ASIN:B000006X6R The Definitive Collection]], The Essential Alan Parsons Project gives the casual fan the proper mixture and proportion of radio hits, Alan Parsons' signature instrumentals, and Eric Woolfsons' thought-provoking ballads. Best of all, SONY/BMG has included the once lost gemstone [[ASIN:B001QYEBVI No Answers Only Questions (Final Version)]] that Eric Woolfson composed and guitarist Ian Bairnson arranged. Everything has been digitally remastered from the best available source tapes. The end result is a product that sounds very good on a moderately priced home system and stunning on audiophile-quality speakers and equipment. If the casual fan sought advice as to where to begin enjoying The Alan Parsons Project, I would whole-heartedly recommend this collection.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I was excited to watch Torchwood because I am both a Doctor Who and Sci-Fi  fan. I thought it would be as good as Doctor Who. I was in for a big dissapointment. The episodes are sub par copies of X-files episodes and other sci-fi series and lack in originality. The characters are uninteresting and the acting isn't that great. I'm surprised that this show hasn't been cancelled. Save your money.

It was exciting to read his accounts of what happened backstage at the actual concert I went to on that tour. I think anyone struggling with addiction could be helped by reading this. Nikki died twice and came back and wants to show that there is a light at the end of the tunnel when you're addicted.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Action! Action! Action!  This movie is equally as good as the first Die Hard.  The special effects are the best and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.

B000VBJEEG|4.0|My experience with rats in movies is generally not positive.  There were the killer rats in \\"Ben\\" and \\"Willard,\\" the over-sized rats in \\"Food of the Gods,\\" and the mega-rats in \\"Graveyard Shift.\\"  Even though \\"Ratatouille\\" had a lot of positive press well before I purchased this movie, I must confess to being apprehensive.  My apprehension was (mostly) unfounded.<br /><br />Remy is an unusual mouse in that he likes to watch the cooking shows of the famous chef, Gusteau.  Remy also has an excellent nose, which his family puts to use to detect poisonous food.  Of course, Remy just wants to cook.  A farmer's wife discovers Remy during one of his sojourns into a farmhouse kitchen.  Remy's discovery soon leads to the discovery of his family and a hasty departure from the farm.<br /><br />After a harrowing journey, Remy ends up in Paris.  Remy soon finds his way to Gusteau's restaurant where he joins forces with Linguini, who is inept in just about everything he does, except for being Remy's hands.  Soon Linguini impresses everyone with his cooking ability, except for Chef Skinner, who planned on capitalizing on Gusteau's name by franchising it.  Linguini's apparent abilities make the restaurant famous again, until the local health inspector discovers rats in the kitchen.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was very creative.  I would never have thought of putting a rat into a restaurant as a chef.  I also thought having a rat control the actions of a human was an interesting twist on the usual role of rats in movies.  I laughed out loud in several places while watching this movie.  Some of the jokes were hilarious.  Other jokes were a little flat.  I also think there were some insider jokes, which were lost on me.  I liked the characters of Remy, Collette (wonderfully voiced by Jeneane Garofalo), Chef Skinner and most especially Anton Ego (extremely well voiced by Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />With all that I liked about this movie, I had a couple of issues, one structural and one personal.<br /><br />The structural issue is that the movie, which is pushing two hours in length, has some slow spots.  I found myself looking at the display on the DVD player to see how long the movie had been on.  I only do that when a movie fails to hold my interest.<br /><br />The personal problem I had was the scene with the rats in the restaurant.  It was bad enough when Remy was sitting on Linguini's hand, and then Linguini was handling food (ewwww), but to see all those rats in the restaurant all over the food preparation surfaces got to me.  Sorry, but that scene was yucky.<br /><br />This release has a nice share of extras.  The two best extras are the shorts, \\"Lifted,\\" which is very funny, and \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" which is pretty good but not quite as funny as \\"Lifted.\\"  There are deleted scenes that fans of the movie will enjoy, though they are still close to the storyboard stage.  There is another feature called \\"Fine Food and Film,\\" which suggests some of the inspiration for the movie.  This movie also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, but other web sites have already covered those well, so I will not repeat them here.<br /><br />If you like animation, especially Pixar's, then you will probably like \\"Ratatouille.\\"  The characters are sympathetic and fun, and the humor is as well.  The only troubling scene is one involving food preparation in a restaurant and hundreds of mice.  Children will doubtless have little problem with the thought of rodents scampering over the scallions, or rats romping in the risotto.  That scene still makes me queasy.<br /><br />Enjoy!The structural issue is that the movie, which is pushing two hours in length, has some slow spots.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|As a long time Neil Gaiman fan, and someone who firmly believes that few movies are as good as the books they are based on, I was worried when I first saw Stardust.  Would the filmmakers and actors be able to capture the magic of the book?    Within the first ten minutes, I realized that the answer was yes.  The basic story is the same: our hero, Tristan, is in love with a girl who challenges him to find her a star.  If he can do it within a week, she will marry him.  So, Tristan travels into the land of Faerie to find it...only to realize that his star takes the form of a human girl.  Worse, he's not the only one chasing her.    From there the story takes off into adventure.  We come across murderous princes, evil witches, human-shaped goats (and vice-versa) and a ship that collects and sells lightening among many others as Tristan tries to save the star and convince her to come back home with him.    The story brilliantly combines action with humor (in particular, Robert DeNiro is very, very funny) and, of course, romance--it is a fairy tale, after all.    There are two things to be careful of.  Neil Gaiman, the writer, said in an interview that Stardust was designed to be a fairy tale for adults.  Though the film cut out the book's bad language, there are still plenty of violent scenes that will be scary to younger viewers and one mostly off-screen sex scene.  Also, fans of the book should be warned that certain events have changed from the original source material.  Personally I thought that was one of its strengths.  If the movie just tried to copy the book, instead of making a good MOVIE, they might well have wound up with something very boring or badly made instead of the wonderful film that resulted.  But if you are a purist, you should be careful.    Aside from the above, I cannot think of a single reason not to recommend this movie.  Check it out.  You'll be glad you did.
B00005JPLW|2.0|Last Friday I saw a matinée of 300.    After the movie I had a cavity filled at my dentist. When they asked me if I wanted any painkillers I told them that Spartans didn't have pain killers. When Spartans were born they were subjected to years of dental checkups without Novocain. They would have mouths of cavities filled without one shot of anesthesia. When they drilled into my tooth I gave out a scream. A warrior scream, not a girly scream, never a girly scream. I cried \\"We are Sparta!\\" Well, it sounded more like \\"Eee aaw Staaata!\\" Of course, the dentist did wonder why I came in greased up and in an ancient loincloth, but then again she probably didn't see the movie.    That night my girlfriend tried to fry me some tofu. I wouldn't stand for it. \\"I don't eat my tofu fried,\\" I said, \\"I eat my tofu raw!\\" I grabbed the uncooked tofu and ripped its slippery flesh with my newly cleaned incisors. \\"This is madness,\\" she exclaimed. \\"No,\\" I said, \\"this...is...tooooofuuuu!\\"    By chance three of my friends from Ohio visited me that weekend. That Saturday the three of us met up with a friend of mine from Boston. He brought four people with him. \\"You only brought three drinkers with you?\\" he questioned. \\"How many alcoholics do you have among you?\\" I asked. Two Bostonians sheepishly raised their hands. \\"O, H\\" I yelled. To which my three friends replied \\"I, O.\\" \\"You see,\\" I said, \\"I brought more alcoholics than you.\\"    At least that's how I pictured my life after seeing this movie. Too bad I just felt lethargic.    300 is the story of Thermopylae, where three-hundred Spartans defended Greece against an onslaught of Persians. Of course, historically speaking, there were plenty of other Greeks and lots of help from the Athenian navy, but don't let history get in the way of a good yarn.    The whole battle starts off from a little misunderstanding. A Persian messenger comes to King Leonidas and asks for him to pay tribute and bow before Xerxes. Well, apparently Spartans don't bowbecause the messenger finds himself looking for the bottom of a bottomless pit. Much of the dialogue is concerned with what Spartans do and do not. \\"Spartans are this and Spartans are that.\\" It's all very boring. In fact, they should have replaced every word with variations on Sparta. \\"Sparta Sparta Spartans. SPARTA!\\"    Right now you're probably thinking to yourself, \\"well, you already made fun of the historical inaccuracies and the dialogue, but I really just came to the movie for the action.\\" That's all fine and good except for the fact that even the action sucks. Sure, the choreography isn't too bad, but the film is almost entirely shot in slow motion. In fact, there's about a half-hour of film stretched out to two hours. I was waiting for the dialogue to be slowed down and the inevitable \\"nooooooooooo\\" but alas the film did not deliver. Slow motion should be used for emphasis, but when every action scene is in slow motion then it loses its impact. It's kind of like using a highlighter to highlight an entire book instead of just the great passages.    There's also an inordinate amount of homoeroticism, which isn't a problem in and of itself, but the fact that the filmmakers seem absolutely unaware of it is rather odd. For example, Leonidas calls the Athenians \\"boy lovers\\" but then goes and greases himself up, puts on a Speedo, and then hangs out with 299 nearly naked greased up men. It's kind of like the pot calling the kettle black. Despite an attempt at showing a romantic relationship between Leonidas and his queen, the only convincing relationship is between the captain's son and the \\"fight in the shade\\" guy (I don't think we hear more than two or three names throughout the movie). I was barraged by a series of come hither glances and double entendre and halfway through the movie I wanted to tell the two to go get a room.    I could continue and complain about lack of characterization, the inane queen plot, or some of the more laughable visual choices but what I really want to talk about is The Watchmen. A Watchmen film has been rumored for years and it seems that 300 director Zach Snyder has finally gotten his CGI obsessed hands on it. The Watchmen is the holy grail of comic books and was even chosen by Time as one of the all time greatest novels alongside The Grapes of Wrath and The Sound and the Fury. It's some heavy stuff with lots of post-modern implications and a questioning of superheroes in general. However, Snyder's handling of 300 has made it evident he does not have the intelligence to handle a Watchmen film.    300 is pretty faithful to the comic book, but in one of the tiniest changes it betrays a complete misunderstanding of Frank Miller's intent. One of Snyder's more awkward visual is his attempt at tearing Ephialtes from the page and putting him on the screen. As expected, Ephialtes looks like a guy with lots of makeup and a fake humpback. It's almost Ed Woodesque. In both the comic and the movie Ephialtes explains that he was born as a Spartan but because of his malformation he was whisked away by his mother to avoid being cast off a cliff. Since that time his father raised him as a Spartan and taught him how to fight. Ephialtes implores Leonidas to allow him to join the Spartans in their battle but Leonidas explains that because of Ephialtes' physical shape he is unable to raise his shield high enough to protect the other Spartans in their famous Phalanx formation.    This is where Snyder changes Miller's words and also shows he doesn't understand the complexities of a mostly undemanding comic book. In Miller's version Leonidas tells Ephialtes \\"I can't use you\\" and then turns his back as Ephialtes jumps off a cliff. In the film Leonidas suggests that Ephialtes carry the dead off the battlefield or take other non-combat jobs before he throws himself off a cliff. Later in the story it is Ephialtes who betrays the Spartans by showing Xerxes the pass that allows him to outflank their position. In Miller'sversion, if Leonidas, and by extension, Spartan society could have mustered the imagination to find a place in society for everyone, then they would never have been outflanked. While most of 300 the comic book exalts the Spartans, Miller still has the insight to slyly critique some of their shortcomings. Snyder completely misses this point, and while reading the comic probably wondered why Leonidas wasn't a little gentler to poor Ephialtes and decided to add the line about carrying the dead off the battlefield. This was a mistake. If Snyder isn't able to understand the slight complexities of 300 then there's no way he's going to understand the mass complexities of Alan Moore's Watchmen. The only hope is that Snyder keeps close enough to the source material that he stumbles upon some of Alan Moore's brilliance.    300 was disappointing, but it was also an adaptation I wasn't expecting, or would have immediately thought \\"hey, what a great property for film adaptation,\\" but Watchmen is. I'll just have to keep telling myself that I'll always have the original no matter how badly Zack Snyder screws up the only graphic novel that matters.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|Ocean's Thirteen is a decent enough movie, with the same trademark twists and turns expected from the previous releases in the series.  We've certainly come to enjoy cheering for the bad guys ripping off another bad guys.  But in this case the extremely poor transfer from film to DVD ruins the experience.  This is, without a doubt, the worst DVD transfer I have seen.  The picture is absolutely full of noise, overexaggerated colors, edge distortion, you name it, it seems to be here.  Dark colors, which are prevalent throughout, are the worst.  Let's hope that this movie gets retransferred and reissued, because right now it is virtually unwatchable without distraction.  I'd almost prefer to watch it on VHS.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Yes, Zep's songs have been repackaged a gazillion times. And there are some niggling omissions from this collection (I would love to hear \\"Going to California\\" remastered like they've done to the songs here). But holy cow -- they never sounded like this! Need proof? Listen to the thrilling, utterly jaw dropping last minute and a half of \\"Stairway.\\" Listen to how Jimmy's rhythm guitar cracks like a severed electrical cable dancing around an automatic weapon -- utterly unbelievable. The bass, the dynamics of the snare drum.... They got all the sludge out here. Amazing work, amazing sound, makes Led Zep 100% modern again.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|The thing about System of a Down is a lot of people can get involved with the music. Not just metal-heads but fans of all genres. Serj Tankian keeps the same sound from SOAD. Some very melodic songs, some more upbeat. Either way, this is a very good CD and I recommend it for anyone who like System
B000YB4G32|5.0|Sawdust rocks. Each song has its own raison d'etre. I hear The Stones, U2, Dylan, The Beatles, lots of influences when I listen to these songs -- not to mention Lou Reed. The synthesizer has soul and the drumming is the best!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|[[ASIN:B000VNMMR0 Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition)]]<br /><br />Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), Mr. wrong place wrong time is there once again. While checking up on his daughter at college McClane is radioed from police headquarters. Apparently the FBI has requested that several know computer hackers be picked up and brought in for questioning. John protest asking to have someone fresh from the academy sent but his boss tells him it has to be a senior detective and he is the closest. What John McClane doesn't know is that the bad guys are on there way to meet with the individual that he is going to pick up as well. Adventure ensues.....<br /><br />This was another great addition to the Die Hard family and if you enjoyed the other Die Hard movies you will probably have fun watching this one too. Is this movie going to win an Oscar? No. Is this movie believable? No. Is this movie at times over the top? Yes. Is this movie fun and enjoyable to watch? Yes, as long as you aren't trying to pick apart what is realistic and what isn't and just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />The Good: Action packed from the minute the movie opens. There are a lot of \\"Edge of your seat\\" action sequences. The story was fairly well done also and includes a lot of topical factors. Bruce Willis seemed to fall right back into the role of John McClane with Justin Long \\"[[ASIN:B000CPH9PM Waiting... (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]\\" playing a solid second as Mathew Farrell, the computer hacker McClane is sent to pick up. Good cameo by \\"[[ASIN:B00000IQC8 Clerks (Collector's Series)]]\\" director Kevin Smith as well.<br /><br />The Bad: The only thing I would classify as a negative was the scene with the jet. I won't elaborate so that I don't give any spoilers but if there was any scene that went a little too far, it was that one and it probably could have been left out of the movie.<br /><br />Overall: The movie was very good and for those who can suspend their disbelief, this movie is fun to watch. If you liked the other Die Hard movies, give this one a try.Die Hard movies, give this one a try.
B00005JPLW|1.0|This film is interesting for one reason only -- it's reproduction of the visual quality of the graphic novel on which it is based. Otherwise the film has no merits at all -- no acting, just endless angry rants from brutish automatons. Gross over-simplification of history in a pathetic attempt to draw a parallel with current events -- a pro-Bush, pro-war, pro-racism parallel.<br /><br />I enjoy a nice violent action flic as much as the next fellow, but this has none of the variation or, dare I say, subtlety that makes such films work. It is just one unending slashfest.<br /><br />I thought the graphic novel was racist anti-historical garbage when I read it, and the film is worse -- a classic example of the Hollywood line in which \\"bad guys\\" are dark skinned and/or ugly, good guys are white. In 300, a surprisingly large number of the Persians are black. Now Persia was what is now Iran -- how close to Africa is that? And if that's not enough to trigger the bigotries of American audiences, Persian emperor Xerxes is, by, not-very-subtle implication, gay.<br /><br />The response of the film's advocates is, predictably, that this is just entertainment. But, equally predictably, if a film were to portray the proxy-Americans as thick-headed barbarians bent only on murder (a portrayal which could indeed be said to accord with the facts of recent years), the film would be condemned.<br /><br />A historical note. The principle historical source for what happened at the battle of Thermopylae is Herodotus. Even in his own time, he was not considered much of a historian. Aristotle reviled him. If you find this unconvincing, how likely do you think it is that Xerxes fielded a force of 1 million or more 2500 years ago?
B000UR9TQE|3.0|In 1976 Led Zeppelin released The Song Remains The Same. This is Led Zeppelin's much loved and much criticized performances pieced together from three Madison Square Garden Shows at the end of their record breaking 1973 tour. I have always had a love hate relationship with this show as its not Led Zeppelin at its best yet like all Led Zeppelin shows has some great moments. There is great interplay and improvisation in No Quarter and Dazed and Confused which for me personally are my favorite live versions of these songs. On the other hand you have a raw and weak voiced Robert Plant and shoddy camera work which left gaps in song which required fantasy sequences by all the members which are both funny and tedious. Yet I bought the 2DVD re-mastered version and was it worth it you ask?<br /><br />Yes it was. The re-mastering job by Page was phenominal. The audio is much more vibrant and crisper. John Bonham's prototype kick drum gets the sound it deserves and Page's leads and solos can be heard in all their fiery glory. Even Plant who is the weak point of this show sounds better and not so raw throat sounding. Let us not forget John Paul Jones the unsung hero of the band whose marvelous bass sound comes through much better and No Quarter is my favorite part of this movie and his fantasy sequence certainly matches up well with the song. Other highlights include getting to hear Over the Hills and Far Away for the first time  and seeing Celebration Day played live on the DVD. Page's violin solo is fantastic and turned up loud in 5.1 is smoking.<br /><br />The Song Remains the Same is Led Zeppelin at its best and worst yet vital to the Zeppelin catalogue and a must for fans. Get it for the superb re-mastering and picture. I was really let down when I first watched this having heard all of Led Zeppelin's albums as a 16 year old kid in 1990 yet at 33 I feel this movie got a much deserved make over which I enjoyed. If you want Led Zeppelin at its best get the 2DVD set Led Zeppelin. If you enjoy the self indulgence of 1970's Rock and Roll then The Song Remains the Same is the epitome of those times. Led Zeppelin has brought so much joy to my life that other than my wife I could never imagine a day without this passionate band and the timeless music. Right now is a great time to be a Zeppelin fan.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This film is a visual splendor, the continuing growth of creative talent in unique styles.  The production values are amazing.  The actors are talented and believable, and not all are familiar faces although I expect to see more of them!  The script is powerful, and the Spartans face an ethical challenge.  Their creed - Never Retreat, Never Surrender - for the Spartan community of all free men, is ingrained from childhood.  All the Persians want is for the Spartans to kneel to their rule.  The Spartans will be granted wealth, power and leadership, in exchange for a bow to the Persian King.  The Persians did not consider that Spartans value honor above all else, and cannot be bribed or cowed into submission, even facing overwhelming forces.  Their battle is poignant and inspiringly courageous.  The Spartans kept their honor, lifestyle and ethics at the price of their lives, and are a shining example of integrity. The wives lovingly say goodbye to their husbands - with the phrase \\"return with your sheild, or on it\\" - which is a vote of confidence and pride in their men.  A fabulous film, watch it and be inspired!
075640407X|4.0|This was a surprisingly difficult book to rate.  How many stars do you give a book like this?  At times it was wonderful, and at other times it was quite bad.<br /><br />On the one hand, lengthy stretches of this book grabbed me, pulled me down, and kept me submerged in a truly wonderful and believable fantasy world.  Some portions of the book were quite adventurous while many others developed believable, intricate characters and wonderful settings.  Patrick Rothfuss, the book's author, did a particularly good (if optimistic) job of creating a believable academic, university setting in a fantasy world.  This setting let him deal with magic in a very thoughtful and intriguing way.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, some portions of the book had me laughing out loud, and others left me thinking, \\"Wow.\\"  Wow, this is exactly how this scene should have gone.  Or - wow, I wasn't expecting that.  How exciting!  Or - wow, that is a really interesting character!<br /><br />On the other hand, lengthy periods of this book were terrible.  Some sections were downright tedious and uninteresting.  I understand why they were there, and how they serve the story.  But still, they could have been written better and could have been more engaging.  Some sections of the book were slow and plodding.<br /><br />Reading requires effort.  Don't get me wrong; I love to read, and I rarely consider fiction-reading to be work.  I really love books and I love words even more.  Still, reading does require effort.  And there were times, when I was reading this, when I wondered if it was worth the effort.  It is a long book and it has some tedious sections.<br /><br />So, how did I decide to rate this book?  Why four stars?  Well, the excellent sections of the book were really excellent, and they made up for the not-so-great sections.<br /><br />But, beyond that, I was particularly impressed by how well the author developed his leading character, Kvothe.  Considering the book, after I had finished it, I was impressed to realize just how much Kvothe changes throughout the novel.  He is one kind of person at one point, and a very different kind of person later.  And then, remarkably, he changes yet again!  It is impressive that the author could pull this transformation off.  It makes sense that the character changes as he does, and the character seems consistent, believable, and fascinating.t how much Kvothe changes throughout the novel.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Once again Michael Moore has created and entertaining and enlightening film on an issue that affects us all.  His newest \\"shock\\"umentary is sure to please, entertain, and raise eyebrows around the country.<br /><br />My concern, though, is with the cult of Michael Moore.  I would like to point out that this is a MOVIE and was made in a \\"for profit\\" market, so watchers beware of the Hollywood-izing that takes place to make such a movie sell.  I find it best to take most of what is said with a grain of salt, and not to base my opinions and views of, say, the US healthcare system purely on what i see on this dvd.  It's a great movie for entertainment, but before you start deciding your political platforms, make sure you do some research of your own.<br /><br />Enjoy and educate.<br /><br />John
141694740X|5.0|I was a magazine editor and columnist and have written about relationships for years. I think I have read almost every book out there on dating, \\"how to catch yourself a man...,\\" etc., etc. But this was, simply, the best-read of any that have come across my desk. I didn't read it when it was first published because of all the hype, and besides - I got the concept, right? Yeah, sure I did. In theory! But desparate times, well...I bought it and read it in one sitting. Then I read it again. Now I am keeping it close to my computer in case I need to consult with a \\"sponser\\" before sending an email I regret. After years of being a quasi-girlfriend or quasi-wife, I see more clearly how to actually create and maintain those high standards for my relationships that I thought I was keeping (I wasn't doing a very good job). Greg and Liz tell you how to do the one thing we all need to do: cut ourselves the slack instead of these people who aren't that vested in us. The concept is simple, the read is easy (but necessary to drive the point home) and the resulting wisdom will affect and correct more areas of your life than just the romance section.   One last thing - this just isn't a book, it is a movement. As women, we have trained generations of men to treat us a certain way. That isn't their fault and it wasn't ours, it was a cultural result of many factors. But now? Well, we can ALL train them better by not accepting less. This will ultimately serve everyone...  A must-read for every American woman! (and I would never say that lightly...)
B000WCDI5K|4.0|The Killers are one of my favorite bands, I'll put that right out there. They sometimes write songs I don't like and they aren't revolutionary. You can lump them in a crowd of others or you can say they steal from Duran Duran, but I don't care...and I usually do. The Killers' first album \\"Hot Fuss\\" embodied the exact sound that I love in modern music. Some call in \\"synth rock\\", \\"synth pop\\", or \\"New Wave\\". Whatever you call it, I like it. There are many new wave bands, but The Killers are the most popular. For some unexplained reason, America latched onto The Killers and music snobs then turned on them. I liked them all the while. And I liked them early, which makes them one of my discoveries, which makes me like them more. However, The Killers are a flawed group in so many ways. Their first cd was a masterpiece. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is still one of the best songs I've ever heard, with the masterful lyric \\"somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in January\\". No one has ever heard that song without being amused. \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\", \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"On Top\\", and \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" were also outstanding. Truly \\"Hot Fuss\\" was one of the top albums of the decade, and I don't take statements like that lightly. But as they rose quickly, they also seemed to make the classic mistep of taking themselves far too seriously. They set out to make an epic album, and touted it as such. They all grew mustaches and abandoned their synths to make an old Western themed concept album. They bantered back and forth with Green Day and Panic! At the Disco and became pop superstars. What came forth was a horrible sophomore slump in \\"Sam's Town\\". Now taken song by song it was not awful by any stretch...it was more disappointing. Where was the \\"new wave\\"? Where were the synths? Where were the ridiculous lyrics? The carefree yelp? It was all gone, replaced by an album that wanted to be more Bruce Springsteen than Duran Duran. \\"When You Were Young\\" and \\"Read My Mind\\" highlighted a batch of decent songs, but the magic was gone. I read a recent article where Brandon Flowers, lead singer, indicated the next full length release will go back to their original sound, which they must know is better. Funny after how epic he indicated \\"Sam's Town\\" would be.    Now last week The Killers released \\"Sawdust\\", a collection of b-sides and remixes to tie fans over till the next album. And tie over it did. I listened to this album in shock, as The Killers \\"leftover\\" tracks continued to pump out one awesome song after another. Most are assorted covers, remixes, or bonus tracks from cds, but they come together nicely. But I'll be darned if these assorted bonus tracks isn't better than the entire \\"Sam's Town\\" cd.    \\"Tranquilize\\" actually might have fit well on \\"Sam's Town\\", but it would've easily been one of the best tracks on the album. Gotta love songs that use children's choruses to yell \\"run away, and give me your sneakers\\", right? \\"Shadowplay\\" then adequately covers a Joy Division song, which tells me something right there...I'm pleased to see them covering Joy Division rather than running off and covering Bob Seger. \\"All the Pretty Faces\\" returns to that carefree yelp of \\"Hot Fuss\\". \\"Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\\" stands very well here as well. The highlight of the whole album is \\"Sweet Talk\\", a synth track which not only would have fit well on \\"Hot Fuss\\", but would've been a highlight. It was after this song I realized I wasn't listening to the average b-side cd and that I was listening to a more enjoyable experience than \\"Sam's Town\\". Some tracks I've heard before, \\"Under the Gun\\", \\"Who Let You Go\\", \\"Ballad of Michael Valentine\\", and \\"Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll\\" are all good songs placed here, though The Killers are kidding themselves if they throw around the word indie. \\"Show You How\\" is also an album centerpiece, as is \\"Move Away\\", a great track featured on the Spiderman 3 soundtrack. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" gets a nod for being a little different, although it apparently was written by Dire Straits, while \\"Sam's Town (Abbey Road Remix)\\" might be the better version of the song. The album concludes in interesting fashion, containing a remix of Mr. Brightside, the 9 and a half minute Jacques Lucont's Thin White Duke Remix. The song is trance-like and amazing. Mr. Brightside might be my favorite overplayed pop song of the last couple years--a song that endless radio play couldn't even kill (or, as I like to say, they \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreamsed it\\", or maybe even \\"Hey There Delilahed it\\"...a shame how the radio can kill good songs). But the remix to Mr. Brightside is wonderful. Not better or worse. Totally different. Totally great.    So there you have it. The Killers live. For as disappointed as I was by \\"Sam's Town\\", I'm just as surprised by \\"Sawdust\\". The Killers clearly know how to make good music, and I doubt this is the last of it. If these are the extras, then I look forward to the main course. Just shave those stupid mustaches, can the concept album, and make more ridiculous songs with synthesizers about boys who look like girls that boys' girls used to date, cause that's awesome.    Download: \\"Sweet Talk\\", \\"Tranquilize\\", \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"Move Away\\"
B00005JPMZ|2.0|The \\"cowabunga, dude\\" boys are back in \\"TMNT,\\" a film that awakens the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from their recent pop culture hibernation, all spruced up and with a spanking new look for the 21st Century.  The human actors in clunky turtle costumes have given way to much spiffier state-of-the-art CGI graphics.  Otherwise it's still the same old quartet of crime-fighting reptiles, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello - named after the four great Renaissance painters, of course - this time taking on some resurrected ancient warriors bent on conquering the world.  Yet, even though the cityscapes are visually appealing, \\"TMNT\\" is a pretty lackluster affair overall with a barely comprehensible storyline and a meager sense of humor.<br /><br />Older fans may be drawn to this film out of sheer curiosity or nostalgia, while the younger set is likely to be intrigued by the colorful backgrounds and simplistic action.  For the rest of us, though, the movie offers precious little of interest beyond reminding us of what passed for a cultural phenomenon a mere decade and a half ago.
B000Y44LBG|4.0|Ridley Scott and company have crafted a pretty good \\"gangsta\\" flick, chronicling the true rise and ultimate fall of a powerful drug lord. It's not one of the best in the genre, but it is still worth a look as well as a purchase once it becomes available for the home market.<br /><br />Though both A-list stars Washington (Frank Lucas) and Crowe (Richie Roberts) immerse themselves well in their respective adversarial roles, acting honors should go to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Lucas's younger brother and John Ortiz as Robert's partner. Ejiofor's transformation from \\"country bumpkin\\" to major henchman for his brother is remarkable while Ortiz's heroin-addicted Javier, though limited in screen, is truly riveting. Along with the aforementioned, Armand Assante, Josh Brolin, and octogenarian Ruby Dee are also noteworthy in their distinctive performances.<br /><br />The highly touted performance by Cuba Gooding, unfortunately, is nothing more than a glorified cameo. It worked for Anthony Hopkins in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" because Lector was so memorable. Gooding's Nicky Barnes is only remarkable for his outlandish attire, nothing more.<br /><br />But, Mark Wahlberg got an Oscar nomination for an equally unremarkable acting turn in Scorcese's \\"The Departed\\"!<br /><br />So, Gooding might just get one, though Ejiofor, Ortiz, Dee, Assante, or Brolin are more deserving of such recognition.

B000VR824S|3.0|OK.....I was there also , and while it was cool to see all these artists in one venue , it definately was not the \\"Greatest Concert \\" ever . Sets were much to short , Mr Murray was much to long winded and perhaps the best performances were out on the second stage before the main show (Jeff \\"Skunk\\"Baxter jamming with Tab Benoit !!!!!)and maybe those two guys at the Fender tent doing \\"Crossroads\\" . I would have been happy paying $90 just to be floored by Beck doing \\"A Day In The Life \\" ...which has been commented on already , and Johnny Winter's one shot at the spotlight . What's wrong with a \\"guitar summit\\" limiting Mr Winter to one full song , while Los Lobos (which bored me to tears) got an entire set ?  The sound during the Jam at the end was horrendous and the sound guy missed a couple of solos . Winwood was very impressive , McLaughlin was much to \\"noodly\\" for that early in the day , and who in the world let Cheryl Crow in ? I got the DVD for the memorabilia aspect of it , since I was there , but it could have been so much better .
0439994349|5.0|For A trilogy that has followed me through the past 11 years of my life, I couldn't be happier with the quality of this edition. It's beautiful cover and quality thick paper do complete justice to the magical content it contains.

0807262013|3.0|The recording of THE AMBER SPY GLASS was wonderful. I enjoyed listening to the many different actors. I was disappointed with the ending of the triology. The first part was exciting and different. Then, Mr. Pullman's story began losing it's grip. The whole triology is an interesting listen, but I guess I was hoping for the \\"grab\\" of HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS. I didn't find that. I did find unique character development and wished the plot could have supported those interesting characters a bit more.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show will keep you on the edge of your seat, while simultaneously laughing at Dexter's mental side-comments. The narrative style of this show allows the viewer to feel like they're more than just watching a story, but someone's life. If you are a vindictive person, this dvd is for you.
B000002PCS|5.0|John Barry who had just lo[[ASIN:0767807596 Chances Are]][[ASIN:0899665144 Bid Time Return]][[ASIN:B000CQM4Y2 Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition)]]st his parents scored a magnificent piece that has moved my life.  I have listened to the music in many settings.  I even played the music at my own mother's funeral.  She also had an uncanny love for this classical score.  Although people who dislike the film seem to dismiss it as just a corny love story, for me, it was a turning point in my life.  One of my friends who also loved the film mentioned the fact that \\"our friends\\" are the only people who can understand the nuances, and that the ones who do not understand will never be our true friends, for they do not share our same spirit. This film's romantic theme is certainly enhanced by the Grand Hotel, the actors, and its simplicity.  Do not expect any spectacular time machines, but rather a change in lighting and endless scenes that mirror impressionistic paintings.  Perhaps a trip to Mackinaw Island in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan might be in order for those on a honeymoon. Regardless, the music flows through the movie like another character and can be enjoyed at anytime.  Love the music, and enjoy and give the film a fighting chance, if only to test the one you love.
0060775858|5.0|It is the perfect bedtime story and when I read it to my children I cannot help but smile both from their looks and also my memroies.    My little girl is now turning pages and pointing out things that attract her.    A true classic for young and old alike.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Run, don't walk, to get this piece of musical brilliance. Especially if you love Back to Black like I do. And if you don't own either, you MUST get both. Frank is a bit more jazz-funk, as is exemplified by the Intro where Amy scats while accompanied by jazz guitar. Yes there are vocal riffs which might put you in mind of Fitzgerald or other jazz phenoms of a better musical time, but Amy definitely has her own unique amazing sound. She has brought a brilliant fusion of jazz, pop and funk to our time which has been bereft of this kind of sound for far too long. There's never over-production with Amy as there is with so many current popular female singers - even the ones that are truly gifted vocally. Love Amy for her honesty both vocally and lyrically in what she composes.    Not only does it shine musically, this cd is also touched with hints of humor and irony which show that while Amy is a serious singer and composer, she isn't afraid to laugh at herself or at life. Love it.
B000VR824S|5.0|yeah it doesn't have a Day in a Life (Definate Highlight!) . yeah its not the 11.5 hour entire event and it does have all that's posted with no missing tracks.  It could have more Cray, more Randolph , Landreth, more Beck, Mclaughlin, Derek etc... That being said what a great Snippet of an unbelievable event.  Got to watch a bunch yesterday and re-live how great that event was.    Highlights for me too many to really pick or place in order but they included:   Presence of the Lord highlight, Vocals from Eric and Steve amazing. The rest of that set all a highlight but Presence stands out.  Isnt it A Pity a goosebump tears to the eye performance.  Any Day from Derek and Susan, Bill Murry and Eric totally digging it on the side of the stage.  Cause we ended as lovers just smoked.  Tal just snarling at Jeff as she rips the bass parts.   Poor Johnny from Cray, Vince Gill and Albert Lee, Robert Randolph on and on all just tore it up. Tell the truth, Hubert Sumlin Sitting on Top of th world, Johnny Winter Highway 61, Doyle, Eric, Derek and Steve taking the solos. On and on and on.  Susan Tedeschi blew me away as did Winwood as I didnt know either could play that well.  A must have and must see especially if you didnt get to see it live.        More to watch later today. I too wish it were 4 disks long as I think it would cover the event a bit better but it is still a 5 Start rating for what we do have on disk.  I also wish all the Cream shows from RAH were completely released but what we have is very cool!     WOO HOO!
0440241030|5.0|Looking at the clustering of reviews with 5 and 1 stars, I'd say Lee Child continues to deliver. A man at the top of his craft. [[ASIN:0440241014 The Enemy]] had drawn me to the witty devil-may-care ex-marine Jack Reacher, [[ASIN:0440241022 One Shot]] was his best escapade so far, and The Hard Way simply continues to hone his inimitable style.<br /><br />The plot is smart and the logic immaculate. Child sweats the little details. The common suspense device of unraveling facts later is not his thing. Instead, a la Agatha Christie of yore, we get all the trivialities as the plot unfolds, which makes it twice as exhilarating when they become relevant to Reacher. The writing is taut as ever. That's welcome in any novel but in a thriller it makes for thumping pace.<br /><br />There's certainly a thing for ammunition here, because Reacher is a connoisseur of the best gadgetry. Unlike many thrillers where the plot surfaces somewhere through the middle and the rest is just jumping through the hoops to make things happen, his stories pulse down to the last wire. We think, wonder and venture with him. And it's all very plausible, relevant. For instance, America's recently instituted \\"forward operating bases\\" play a non-trivial part in the script. These novels are as informative as they're action packed.<br /><br />If you want top-class, nail-biting, keep-awake-at-night entertainment, this will fit the bill just fine. A highly satisfying read before you move on to Bad Luck and Trouble.
0060899190|5.0|I love this book. It is a fun read and I felt like some of the secrets could have been sent by me! The artwork is great and it is very touching.
B00005JN0T|5.0|When I suggested to Will Smith that he should do \\"I, Robot\\" I warned it was inevitable that people would say the result wasn't close enough to the Azimov's writings. Go ahead - you try. Azimov's books are for reading and I understand that translating it to cinema is a big challenge. For me, there were many scenes in the movie that were exactly what I imagined as I read. Smith's character was a little experimental but after Independence Day, I was completely convinced that a little of his characteristic cockiness would make it more entertaining for modern audiences. I still laugh when I think about him smacking the alien in the face (Independence Day) in their first face-to-face encounter. Azimov's work is not comedy however and I would take that back today, but would still be very happy with Smith as the lead character. I am willing to take responsibility for Smith's humorous deviation from pure Azimov. It was my fault. I will say however, that his portrayal merely added a little rather than being completely different (while not denying that the addition made it different).    Russian immigrant Azimov blended commentary on mass social (and political) movements and cultural differences in his writing as clearly as descriptions of science and environment - which rivaled Jules Verne. The robot rebellion itself, complete with central computer, mirrored the Bolshevik Revolution and rise of Communism. He defined (take this literally) the meaning of \\"hero.\\" (One person can make a difference.) Some might have been more satisfied had the film included a Blade Runner type narration to beat home particulars - to have made the central computer's (V.I.K.I) reasoning for the take-over clearer. While viewing with others previously unfamiliar with the story, I heard some \\"What?\\" - \\"Why?\\" and even a \\"What's wrong with that?\\" The apparent loss of understanding of the evil of dictatorship and value of freedom convinces me that Azimov's work is as important today as it ever was.    I think it is important to bring Azimov's work to the screen, not least because it is some of the very best science fiction produced in the twentieth century. And I do prefer keeping films true to the original work. I would argue that this film is the best adaptation of Azimov so far. Letting action speak for itself - to some extent - is not entirely wrong in film. I am hoping that sci-fi fans everywhere will join me in encouraging more Azimov at the movies in the future; regardless of the challenge. Perhaps a nip and tuck here and there will bring the experience a little closer to the read. But I will now caution viewers just as I caution movie-makers. If you really want the full experience of the book - read it!

0330491962|5.0|Flaubert's Parrot by Julian Barnes is a book I have had queuing up to read for some time. I don't know why I have never got round to reading it. Perhaps it's because of the overtly \\"literary\\" tag that was attached to it when it was short-listed for the Booker Prize. I am not against \\"literary\\" fiction. Far from it: indeed I aspire to write it, after a fashion. My avoidance of Flaubert's Parrot was never conscious, but was probably a result of thinking that I knew what to expect - word play, experimentation with form, biography, dissection of the writer's role, relationship between art and life, in fact all the mundane things that your average novelist has for breakfast. The less than average ones, by the way, always have corn flakes. It is their convention. Having just finished the book, I can declare that I found all I expected and much, much, much more.<br /><br />Julian Barnes has his character, a doctor called Geoffrey Braithwaite, consider various literary ideas. One, which only really applies to writing prose fiction, is the relation between form and content. Most novels, certainly most pulp fiction, never address this, since the authors usually present apparently literal material merely literally or, perhaps even more commonly, fantastical material literally. Generally within some recognisable genre, these offerings tend to preoccupy themselves with simple narration. In effect, most novels are presented in pictorial form, like a comic strip running a frame at a time through the author's mind, with only minimally extended commentary. Their presentation is invariably linear, with the writer's aim to spoon-feed the reader with bite-sized chinks of easily digestible plot in a context aimed at simplifying the experience.<br /><br />Flaubert's Parrot is the polar opposite of this. The only plot is Flaubert's life, both physical and intellectual, alongside that of his enthusiastic intended biographer, the doctor, Geoffrey. Geoffrey's research, notes, speculations and musings provide the book's utterly original form. Since the adultery of Flaubert's fictional Madam Bovary provided the scandal that created his fame, evidence of his attitudes towards women and sex in his own life provides a fascinating backdrop against which we can assess the author's motives and desires. The death and revealed adultery of the narrator's own wife provides motive for his obsession with Flaubert and his femme fatale, and, quite unexpectedly, this culminates in a truly moving moment of emotional empathy that the author, Barnes, not Flaubert, not the narrator, evokes in his reader.<br /><br />This emotional intensity developed as a real surprise towards the end of the book. Through it, Julian Barnes achieves a perfect marriage of form and content, the finest I have ever encountered. No matter how much we analyse the creative process, it is our emotional lives that provide the stuff of art. The writer moulds it, contextualises it, formalises it, but eventually the rawness of the experience, the chasm of bereavement, the hollow of betrayal, the consonance of love that makes us laugh or weep as we read, and Julian Barnes provokes both responses in this beautiful book.<br /><br />There are some stunning moments of virtuosity. There are, for instance, three concatenated chronologies of Flaubert's life - an encyclopedia of success, a record of failure and a personal diary. This is a masterstroke, effectively answering the rhetorical question of why we remain interested in the author, even when we consider a work as iconic as Madame Bovary. The narrator's dissection of \\"correctness\\" in fiction is utterly poignant, especially so when we cannot even agree on the detail of reality. And so what if the writer decides to change things around? Isn't it supposed to be fiction?<br /><br />But the enduring memory of Flaubert's Parrot is that masterstroke of marrying motives via Falubert's real life, whatever that was, the imagined world of his femme fatale and the apparently real life of Geoffrey Braithwaite, with its own experience of adultery and bereavement. And then, of course, we have Geoffrey's obsession with Flaubert, through which we reflect on the ideas of the self and its selfishness. Stunningly beautiful.<br /><br />And the parrot? Probably a fake. Or perhaps just faked. Or then again....te, with its own experience of adultery and bereavement. And then, of course, we have Geoffrey's obsession with Flaubert, through which we reflect on the ideas of the self and its selfishness. Stunningly beautiful.    And the parrot? Probably a fake. Or perhaps just faked. Or then again....
B000VI70WM|3.0|Like many, I'm am indecisive as to whether I love it or hate. I will say that nothing has the intensity, energy, or sexuality of a song like \\"All She Wants Is\\" which was written 20 years ago and would be the closest comparison to the \\"sound\\" it appears they going for here. Not a big follower of Timbaland or familiar with his work, but I can say I don't understand all the hype surrounding him..I've heard better beats from pre-sets on a Casio. Nile Rodgers, R.I.P.  Ironically, the tracks that seems to work best here and most popular with the fans are the more organic, guitar based songs such as \\"Box Full O' Honey\\" and \\"She's Too Much\\" Yet even they don't seem to live up to their full potential as John's bass and Roger's live drums are sorely missed and Nicks synths are buried way back in the mix.  I do applaud them for the attempt and somewhat success of a \\"fresher\\" sound, however overall the album sounds rushed and under-produced...the compositions could have been fuller with more varied instrumentation, preferably more organic to compliment the dry, sterile, and mechanical beats.  Better luck next time guys...still love ya though.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I went to see Beyonce in NJ at the Meadowlands Arena....James Brown was known as the hardest working man in show biz, and understandably Ms Knowles can take the crown of hardest working female performer.  So Many concerts I've seen where the performer gives you just enough, whereas Beyonce gives you her all.  A two hour show of one performer at concerts is most definately unheard of, but that is what she brung to us, making you feel that you didnt mind spending that kind of cash to see her.  She's definately worth it.<br /><br />I commend her beauty, talent and humbleness that you felt coming from her throughout her show.  She's truly appreciative of her fans, no question.  I wasnt blessed enough to see Destinys Child and Jay-Z step onto the stage with her, but i did see her mom holding her nephew, and her father was on hand with the sound man throughout the show and he was friendly and glad that we were having such a great time.<br /><br />Beyonce, I've been a fan of hers from day one, and have all her music, yet at the Beyonce Experience concert I was astounded at her range in vocals that people (the haters) dont hear on her cd's.<br /><br />Lastly, I will go to ANY concert that Beyonce graces us with in the future.

B000ULQV0W|4.0|Now this is how you go solo! This album is one of the very few albums I can listen start to finish without skipping a track. I am a big Pearl Jam fan. Some reviewers say you have to be 40 or 50 years old to be one. I haven't hit 30 yet.     If you are a Pearl Jam fan, this album may or may not disappoint you depending on how much you enjoyed the vocals. Its mostly Vedder and his guitar. Vedder proves that he doesn't need more than that.    The album starts out with the relatively fast paced \\"Setting Forth\\" and \\"No Ceiling\\". It transitions smoothly into the softer tracks like \\"Long Nights\\" and \\"Toulumne\\" which is instrumental. \\"Hard Sun\\" then makes it really interesting with Corin Tucker (from the rather obscure band called \\"Heavens to Betsy\\") providing background vocals. For those hardcore PJ fans, you will be happy to hear some electric guitar in this track. \\"Society\\" then switches gears to get you in a rather pensive mood. This is where Vedder makes this all look too easy. The album ends with the track \\"Guarateed\\" that makes you want to get up and just take a walk... into the wild.    I gave only 4 stars because I really don't understand why \\"Toulumne\\" and \\"The Wolf\\" are in this album. They dont really seem to add any value to the album and seem more like fillers. Perhaps it will make more sense if I watch the movie.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|2 hours of my life wasted. This is a terrible movie, who could have been saved if they didn't try hard to create absurd action scene, which are so dumb in their execution, they completely ruin the movie.    Where do I start?    Black helicopter loitering above DC, without being shot?  FBI Swat team on their way for the rescue turning in circle above a harbor in a landlocked state?  Building an office space in a elevated parking lot?   The F35 scene is the DUMBEST action scene EVER!!!! I seriously was expecting the USM pilote to go after John with his knife once he ejected!  The hot asian bad girl, getting hit by a ford expedition at 35 miles an hour, full frontal, but still surviving it? he legs were probably protected but the huge boots she was wearing....    And the list goes on.....    Avoid this movie like the pest, it is just bad.    I feel sorry for bruce willis, He can do better than that....

The Show was great and putting dark side  live in it's entirty was a great testament to their loyalty to their fans  this was one of the all time great concerts the extra's could have been better but the concert more than makes up for it. Davids guitar solo's were supreme no other guitar player can play the strat as smooth and sweet and when it comes time for the more aggresive songs well let's just say david hasn't lost anything with age.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I grew up in the 70's listening to the Eagles. Loved the older stuff; not such a fan of The Long Run. The first time i heard this album, 5 or 6 songs jumped out at me & i didn't like 3 or 4 others. Having heard this 2 more times now, my opinion has completely changed. The 2 & 3 part harmonies are fantastic. As it has been stated in other reviews, there are many moments when you think back to older Eagles songs. But this release clearly reflects the aging of the members. There is a fantastic sense of loss on may of the songs. Clearly these songs were written by folks aware of the passage of time; there is a softer, sadder almost melancholy feeling to some of the songs. My favorite song on the discs is Waiting in the Weeds. Didn't like Long Road out of Eden at first, love it now. Also like How Long, What Do I Do ..., No more Cloudy days, Love to Watch a Woman, Center of the Universe, It's your world now. After listening to this disc, it makes me wish these guys had written more music. There just isn't anything this good being written today.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Nothing but praise here. A true artist with no signs of slowing down. Annie seems to have the knack for picking the perfect mixture of upbeat and more somber tones so don't worry about this album being too serious. It has a lot of melodic rythmic sounds going on reminiscent of her past stuff, with the added bonus in my opinion of taking on serious feelings and issues when it needs to.  I only wish a work of art could really help to change the world for the better. I think Annie would definitely agree and maybe this is her best effort to do so.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I wasn't sure what I was expecting from the Eagles' new release \\"Long Road Out of Eden.\\" I was reasonably sure from the title that I would get a good dose of anti-imperialism from Don Henley, my favorite angry white California Muslim. I wanted at least a glimpse of greatness that is \\"Hotel California\\" and maybe some tasty west coast country rock as only the Eagles could deliver back in the day.<br /><br />The title cut packs the biggest anti-war punch. Beyond the title itself, it's full of allusions to the Roman Empire, condemnation of wealth and greed, hypocrisy... it's all there. The a cappella \\"No More Walks in the Woods\\" has great signature Eagles harmonies underscoring the environmental travesty that is the Bush administration. \\"Frail Grasp of the Big Picture\\" is Henley's biggest stab at the press since \\"Dirty Laundry.\\" \\"Business as Usual\\" sets a musical score to the Republican agenda.<br /><br />There's some pretty good non-political stuff too and again, it's mostly Henley's. \\"How Long\\" is a great Henley-Frey romp with an \\"Already Gone\\" feel and \\"Too Busy Being Fabulous\\" is a great somebody done Don wrong song as only he can write them.<br /><br />The album delivers in terms of Don Henley's political punch, but the rest of the double CD leaves much to be desired. There's a lot of songs on the CD that just suck. Joe Walsh's contributions have his signature slide guitar, but the rest leaves much to be desired. On some of the ballads it's difficult to tell the difference between Glenn Frey and Timothy B. Schmidt, but the songs are so awful that it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />If I think of the album as a Don Henley album with the Eagles as backup, and skip through most of the non-Henley tracks I can minimally feed the Eagles jones that has built up since 1979's \\"The Long Run\\", which was their last full studio release. I think we called them records then and they were made of vinyl.
B000VI70WM|4.0|Longtime Duranie here. No it's not exactly like any of their albums, but SO MANY INFLUENCES are apparent. Don't try to compare it to this or that just enjoy the music for what it is. Duran Duran, or any band for that matter, shouldn't be held up to such rediculous standards that their albums must possess some kind of extraordinary magical ability to please everyone. So tired of all the negativity. We should all be happy that this extraordinary group of people decided to keep on making music despite all the bs out there. I love listening to this album. Sure it reminds me of their older sound, but then the first release reminds me or Ordinary World in its emotional openness. As for the Timbaland and Timberlake influence, I think Duran Duran kept their own sound admirably, and yes they were willing to adapt to the present in the process. I give kudos for their adaptibility and so great they gave me this album to enjoy some more of them. I'll take it and say a big THANK YOU--sure beats most of the current music out there!
B000UX6TRK|5.0|Absolutely a stunning performance of Lionel Richie and his band. Especially the sax player Dino, a great show of him and his amazing solo.  There was no fault in 5.1 racording of the performance.
B00005JPRD|5.0|I wasn't born in the 60s...but I had the privilege of growing up with a father who just so happens to be obsessed with The Beatles. Needless to say, that obsession was passed on to me. I may not have lived through these times or had the opportunity to experience The Beatles when they were really around, but I feel like I was there. When talking about it, I'm constantly referring to everything as though I was there firsthand.     I bought the soundtrack before I saw the movie, and that was really all it took. I fell in love. I usually cringe when I hear that a musician or band has covered a Beatles tune...but the way the cast sang these songs...it surprised me in all the best ways. Out of 31 tracks, I only skip 2 of them, those tracks being the instrumental songs that I never really cared for.     I couldn't wait to get home to see 'Across The Universe'...the theatre by my campus overlooks art films, which is a shame. I went into this movie feeling like I was eight years old. That's what The Beatles do to me. I'm going to be 22, yet when I hear them, I just become so giddy. I watched this movie the entire time with a smile on my face...with moments of tears in between. The movie was everything I thought it would be. I've been seeing previews for the film since May, and I was transfixed by them. Beatlefest was full of 'Across The Universe' mentions and trailers...true Beatles fans will appreciate what Taymor put together. The film has an amazing cast--the chemistry is inevitable.     I have an obsession with films...I love them all. My favorites tend to come from decades in which even my parents weren't alive to experience. After seeing 'Across The Universe', I realized that this was perhaps the movie that I've been waiting for. Because of my film knowledge and the fact that I want to be a film historian, people are constantly asking me what my favorite movie is, I never had an answer...I had a list. Now, I have an answer. I loved this movie so much; I went to see itthree times in theatres...I'd still be going if they hadn't taken it out already. Each time that I saw it, the film only got better. I don't know if I'll be able to wait until February for the DVD.

B000KC8O3S|5.0|I like cinematic-style soundtracks, and my experience has usually been that you get one or two pieces of entertaining music and the rest is so slow it puts you to sleep. Not this one. There are several styles of music contained in this CD, all of them terrific. Murray Gold is a genius. Not since John Williams have I been so impressed by a composer. I received this CD today and have already listened to it in its entirety 3 or 4 times. Give this a try, you won't be dissapointed.
B00008NEQM|5.0|I like this music, since his 1st Cd, and I has a great music, a mix between New Age, and Choral, wich lift the spirit and the senses, for a comfortable time.  If you like this kind of music, you are getting a great Cd.
B000000XCH|5.0|Widely considered Creedence Clearwater Revival's peak effort, this album includes an astounding six 1970 top five singles like 'Lookin Out My Back Door' and 'Run Through The Jungle'.  My favorite tracks are the two longest: the seven-minute opener 'Ramble Tamble' and the eleven-minute cover of 'I Heard It Through The Grapevine'.  There more covers complete the tracklist.  This is strongly recommended for CCR fans looking for something beyond their excellent greatest hits collection.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I was delighted to find this 40th Anniversary Editon of one of my all-time favorite movies. The 2-disc set not only contains the movie itself, there are interviews with the original actors as they are now. it was great fun to see the children all grown up. And the section where Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminisce is priceless.<br /><br />If you liked the movie the first time around, be sure to grab this new edition to add to your DVD collection.
B000002HD5|5.0|I picked this album up as a free promo while working at a record store when it came out.  I was in my late 20's.  Listened to it and filed it.  Flash forward 10 years and I find the disc in a box, throw it on my ipod. I listened to this record at 43 and was totally blown away. This is true work of genius; as important a record as any released in the 1990's.   The musicianship is outstanding, The lyrical content stretches beyond to genre to capture the zeitgeist of an entire generation. Clearly one of the best albums of the last 20 years.
6305320802|4.0|Well, I've read all the reviews of the 50th anniversary edition, which I have not yet bought, but I bought the laser disc Todd A-O edition that came out some years ago, and also the DVD version that was issued in 1999.  Here I have a question.  Is there a difference between the 1999 DVD version and the one that's on the 50th anniversary edition that has been so thoroughly lambasted by most of the reviewers here at amazon?  I ask this because I'm sitting here looking at the 1999 Todd A-O DVD on a 768 Line HD Plasma TV, and I must say that it looks utterly stunning!  THe sound is as crisp and rich as the laser disc, and the picture is actually an improvement.  My only complaint is that the skin tones are not quite true; but this I easily fixed by adjusting the color tint on my TV.  The picture here is bright and crisp.  So this leads me to wonder if something terrible happened to the Todd A-O transfer somewhere between the 1999 version and the one contained on the more recent 50th anniversary edition.  Can somebody who has both versions (or all three, if you count the laser disc version) shed some light on this mystery?
0525950079|3.0|Like so many others, I loved PILLARS OF THE EARTH and was thrilled to see that Follett had written a sequel.  Unfortunately, this book was not nearly as well-written or engaging as PILLARS, and I had to struggle to finish it.    I agree with what others have said about the inappropriate use of 21st century slang (\\"shagging\\", \\"bring him off\\", etc.)  Caris, to me, seems like a 21st century character plopped down in the 1300's.  Everything about her character and actions seems far too modern, as though she were a time-traveler from our own era, rather than someone who was born and raised in that time period.    The writing style got very annoying after a while.  90% dialogue, 10% description.  Endless conversations, with very little description of the character's thoughts or motivations.  It came off as a very \\"talky\\" book, where the characters spend more time debating what to do than actually doing it.    Overall, I was quite disappointed.
B000VBIEXS|3.0|Brain Salad Surgery, ELP's 1973 crowning achievement.  There is a lot to like about this record.  The music of course, which was highly innovative for that era.  The interesting and thought provoking cover art.  Even the title of the album was innovative.  In the short span of four years and five albums, Emerson Lake and Palmer truly pushed the envelope of early progressive classical/rock fusion to another level.  In fact they took it right to the top of mainstream music on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />As much as I've enjoyed the other Shout! Factory re-issues, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers and say this time, they fumbled the ball.  The games not a total loss, there are some high-lights.  I commend the fact that Shout tried to recreate the original style opening cover art.  But why on earth did they crop the artwork so bad? (see my thumbnail photo).  That is the actual view on the front cover.  P. Jackson's photo gives a good example of how it is designed to open, but does not show the mis-alignment of the outer cover with the inner photo.  The inner circle is supposed to lay exactly over the photo beneath it.  Notice how high up the skull's eye sockets are?  They don't match the woman's face underneath.  Also, see the letters ELP at the bottom.  They are virtually cut in half!  This is how badly the cover is cropped.  I have an original album, and this is not how it's supposed to be.  The inclusion of a replica of the original poster is nice.  But, again, the cover art is cropped and it's not printed on all sides as was the original poster.  The booklet is great.  Interesting liner notes and good photos of the band on stage from that era.<br /><br />Now let's get to the most important part: the Sound of the Music.  As Noel Pratt points out, there are some problems with the mastering.  At approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds into Jerusalem the volume level jumps up dramatically.  About 10 decibels in just a few seconds.  It's as if someone in the control room noticed how low the level was and tried too quickly to run it up to the correct level.  If it was done slowly over the course of 30 seconds or so things would have been much better.  I think this is just a bad case of the producer trying to make this re-issue more dynamic than previous renditions.  My suggestion would be to skip track one and record the  alternate mix of Jerusalem provided here as a bonus track (#9).  And as far as the complaints about \\"muffled\\" sound.  I agree...somewhat.  In a close comparison of this re-issue with the former Rhino issue from `96, there is major difference.  The Shout issue has a more prominent bottom-end.  The problem is it's not isolated to the bass or kick drum, it's an over-all increase in the entire low-end spectrum, even effecting the vocals.  The impression is the vocals getting slightly \\"buried\\" in the murkiness and sounding a little more distant.  The Rhino issue has a much cleaner and crisper sound.  Note that this comparison took place on a pair of high-quality head-phones that allow every little nuance to be heard.  If one is comparing sound on various speaker systems it can be a very different and subjective comparison to the human ear.  For instance, If you played this Shout re-issue in a car with a stock stereo system, you may want the extended bottom-end compensating for the lack of, due to poor quality speakers.<br /><br />Now I'm glad I picked up a copy of  Rhinos `96 re-issue of Brain Salad Surgery at a used record store (it's currently out of print).  I liked the 3-D cover that changes as you tilt it from the Skull shot to the Female face.  I actually bought it because I thought it would be a collector's item.  Now I think I prefer the sound on it to any thing else that's been put out so far.<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, some record company will finally create the Definitive Remastered Expanded Deluxe version with all the possible bonus tracks available, and get all the newest most creative packaging avialable to bring it all together for the Grang Finale of this most deserving Masterpiece.  Until then...g it all together for the Grang Finale of this most deserving Masterpiece.  Until then...
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Serj Tankian proves what eveyone already knows...He is the new voice for the underrated majority. Elect the Dead displays the true genious of System of a Down's frontman. The entire album is a verbal assault on the corrupt structure of world affairs done in a symphonic verbal assault. Highly Recommended! A benchmark for all new revolutionary metal.   5/5 !
B000VNMMR0|3.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is the 4th movie in the 19-year-old \\"Die Hard\\" franchise, and NYPD cop John McClane is looking a little elderly. After the FBI's computers are breached by hackers, Deputy Director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) of the agency's Cyber-Security Division wants every computer geek with the skills to have done the job brought in for questioning. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is asked to escort a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) from New Jersey to FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. But someone is out to kill Farrell, and the nation's transportation systems, financial infrastructure, and power supplies are being thrown into chaos by an unknown cyber-terrorist.<br /><br />The action is generally satisfying. The car stunts are not CGI. A confrontation between an 18-wheeler and a fighter jet is creative, if improbable. The script deflects some of the incredulity at seeing a 52-year-old Bruce Willis survive these stunts by poking fun at his old bones and low-tech approach. The plot and dialogue are silly even by action movie standards, however. The film simply alternates between action and geeks tapping on keyboards. Farrell's greasy-haired, socially inept computer geek stereotype is a couple decades out of date. Geeks are yuppies now. We see too little of villains Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and Mai Lihn (Maggie Q), who seem more interesting than the people we do see. Good action, but \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" has trouble maintaining interest and credibility between action sequences.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007 Unrated single disc): There are 2 versions of the movie on the same disc, the theatrical PG-13 version and an unrated version with a little more gore and stronger language. The sole bonus feature is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis, and editor Nicolas De Toth. Willis and Wiseman talk about the evolution of the characters and story, to which they contributed. Other topics of discussion include edits, the differences between a PG-13 and R rating, the creative crew, and filming the action. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.edits, the differences between a PG-13 and R rating, the creative crew, and filming the action. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

1594489505|5.0|This is an amazing book. It really gives you excellent insight into what women are facing in the Middle East.  We've all heard about the Taliban and how they treat women. But very few people have heard of it in a story through speacific people with speacific situations. I definately recommend that every woman read this book. It really puts life into perspective and it will make you want to do more to help those women.  Happy reading!
B000VR824S|5.0|THE SET IS GREAT, ALL EXCEPT FOR LA--MO CHERYL CROW...AND ITS NOT BECAUSE SHE IS A FEMALE....ITS BECAUSE SHE IS A POSER WAY OUT OF HER LEAGUE...MERRY CHRISTMAS !!!!!!!!!!!
B000VEA38E|5.0|Well, here you have it. All off it. As complete a score as possible for the Original Trilogy. This release is the best to get if one does not yet already own the original trilogy soundtracks on CD. Each original Episodes' soundtrack is expanded and spread over 2 CDs (same musical content as the 1997 20th anniversary release), as well as a multimedia CD and another disc, called the Corellian, which features the core themes from all six films. And to top it all off, the artwork is quite good. So is this release of the Star Wars Trilogy soundtrack worth it?? Yes, however, only if you don't already own the 1997 remastered editions.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|This High Def version of all three movies is a revelation.  Right down to the matrix code itself.  The picture is crisp and clear with details never before visible.  The sound is crystalline in it's precision and buoys the story along with kid gloves.  In dark scenes, such as under the bridge when they first take Neo under their wing, you can see Keanu's make-up as clear as day.  Rouge, pancake, and delicately done eyebrows. This occurs with all the actors throuhout the movie, though, after your initial reaction it is not distracting.  However this could present a problem for movie makers and I wonder that the Warchowski's didn't think of it since they knew they were in virgin territory filming the movies in High Def.  They thought of everything else!!!<br />To me though the real breathtaking scene wasn't the action sequences (even though they DO take your breath away).  It was Neo's visit to the Oracle.  The nuances flittering across her face as she deftly guided him in the right direction is a study in acting.  You can see the depth of her disease eating away at her in and under her eyes, but her talent will out and such detail in facial expression and tonal delivery is as rare as an Olivier or a Tracy.  It is a pity that she was unable to complete the trilogy, and it hurt the overall project more than most will admit.  However this is a review of the HD-DVD version of these films and let's just say that I have watched the movies probably twenty times each since their release and this was the first time I really and truly saw them.  Nuff said.
B000002H38|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of all time. I never tire of listening to this timeless classic.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This was a great buy. Diana has that sultry (and although I hate to use the term) - sexy way of singing that would please most people.  The record delivers on all counts - singer and music.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Firstly, I love Ms. Whit Whit.  But this CD is just borders between bad & OK. None of the songs she sung were great.  She completely OVER SINGS.  Holding notes way to long.  I don't need you to take me through the entire octave - minus the really high notes, just to belt out one word.  I also don't need you to hold one note for 5 hours.         It's extremely R&B/Gospel which is NOT bad but I've always believed that Whitney has a pop voice. My favorite Christmas CD's are Temptations, Yolanda Adams & Ms. Patti.  But Whitney just can't do that style very well.  So, all this soulful, holding notes for 15 minutes, with a raspy voice ruined some of these classics for me.  You can tell her voice HAS changed and that she's a smoker, former drug addict and current alcoholic. Sounds harsh but when you listen to this CD, you'll understand.  All the rave reviews must be coming from family, friends and die hard Whitney fans.  If you want Classic Whitney, this ain't it.       Just be prepared to want to return this CD.
B00000IQMT|5.0|Say what you will about Episode I, we're talking about the music here. John Williams composed the music for every single Star Wars film. In 1999, when we found out he would return to score the prequel trilogy, it was great news. With this album, Williams has breathed new life and created new music for a series that began about 30 years ago. My review is slightly biased, as this is the first orchestral soundtrack to enter my library, and has a special place. I am truly surprised at the lack of Awards recognition. If you are a John Williams fan, a Star Wars fan, or a film score fan, this is highly recommended.
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|Who would have thought it possible to improve on Casablanca?????????  Well, buy this and revel in it.  Everything that worked up to now, the sets, the lighting, the camera work, the shadows, the acting (especially the ecsquisite ham on wry of Claude Rains), the atmosphere, the witty dialogue, the close-ups of Bogey And Bergman; all are enhanced by this new technology.  Viva La Hi-Def!  I am forever in your debt.  Now where did I put those 'letters of transit'!!!  I just have to travel to Casablanca one more time before the Nazi's cut off all ingress!
B000YABV90|5.0|The other two reviews tell the story. I saw it with my wife and son and his wife - we all loved it. Treat your self to hearing the music that really is all around us. See this movie. Tell your friends to see this movie. Help make the world a better place
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I am a true fan of Beyonce although I missed her performance in Houston over the summer she really made it up with this show. Despite lacking extras Beyonce and her people really put something together that in my book will never be topped. From the new arrangements of some of the songs down to the House of Dereon/Dereon outfits everyone wore the show was in a class of it's own and Beyonce gave her all. In comparison to the Live At Wembley dvd the Beyonce Experience was very much a drastic improvement seeing as there is a much larger set used. I also must recommend the Beyonce Experience because of the setlist used. There aren't any covers used this time since Beyonce caught plenty of criticism for exposing her fans to different styles. She does the ballads, such as \\"Flaws and All\\", \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Dangerously In Love\\", great justice despite \\"DIL\\" not being the best compared to past performances (See Live At Wembley and Destiny Fulfilled and Lovin' It). It's also a delight to see Beyonce add in elements of other songs such as adding the music of Prince's \\"If Eye Was Ur Girlfriend\\" into \\"03 Bonnie and Clyde\\" as well as Jill Scott's \\"He Loves Me\\" in \\"Dangerously In Love\\" which works despite unecessary runs at the end of the song. The appearance of Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams is also nice to see although it doesn't seem that long ago that Destiny's Child broke up. Overall the show is worth it's $10 value because it's funky, refreshing, and creative.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|This 3 CD collection contains all the standard soundtracks for Lord of the Rings. So Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King are all here, one disc each, in a box designed by Alan Lee I believe. In addition to all 3 single-disc soundtracks, you get all the 'collector' cards (sometime when a soundtrack CD for a major film event is released there are 5 or 6 different character covers you get to choose from). This release is recommended for someone who does not own any Lord of the Rings soundtrack, as you get all three in one shot for a pretty good price, or for the casual listener. For REAL fans of either Lord of the Rings or film score, I suggest looking into the the Complete Recordings as it is essentially listening to the film.
B000UR366S|2.0|I am a big fan of Joni, but only her post-60's music. Court and Spark was the album that hooked me. Shine is a strange album. I've listened to it several times, almost memorized the lyrics to the title song, but yet something was missing. I then listened to this CD (on Ultimate Ear triple.fi Pro 10 earphones), and realized that there was little or no soundstage, the music seemed jammed towards the center channel rather than spread across the listening space. Many of the intsruments were close-miked, and had no 'air' around them. The cymbals on Shine and other songs seemed to be manipulated, so that their decay was un-natural, and sustained for effect. Bass was bloated and not comparable to her other albums. I could tolerate Shine on good speakers, but it just doesn't work for me on headphones. Still, I'm glad to have this in my collection.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I make sure that I watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation at least once during the holidays. It really has it all. It is one of those films that will never get old no matter how many times you've seen it. I mean how could the sight of cousin Eddie in his bathrobe emptying sewage from his mobile home on a nice winters morning get old? If you haven't seen this one yet I would strongly recommend picking it up. The whole family will love it.
032147404X|4.0|I'm an amateur photographer who wanted a book to show me how certain things were accomplished without all the technical discriptions to go with them.  This book is what I've been looking for.  I will purchase other books to tell me the techie stuff but for a quick \\"how'd they do that\\" fix this is it for me.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book, however, is Scott's constant cheesy humor.  In my opinion it's distracting to the reader and unnecessary.  If he wants to be funny then he should write a joke book.  I don't mind a little humor here and there, but it's littered throughout the book and very annoying.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for the a book for the same reason I was then give this one a try.
0061547832|4.0|As usual, Donald is great in the book. Tough, insightful, candid, and maybe even a touch overconfident.. sometimes.. maybe. If you've read his other books it's variations on a theme.    Not sure I see what the value-add of Bill Zanker was. I was like who the F is Bill Zanker. Ending each chapter with this guy's own story was cheesy. IMO, too peppered with his tie-ins for his Learning Annex. Umm, excuse me Bill I bought the book for \\"Donald Trump\\", not you.    Think I'll request a partial credit for the # of pages Bill writes. Really detracted from the book for me.
0618680004|5.0|Caveat - I'm not really a Atheist, although I'm sure I qualify as an Agnostic.<br /><br />Bottom line, Dawkin's book is a masterpiece.  Dawkins is at the forefront of a movement that I believe will eventually lead mankind to a place where supernatural beliefs will fade away.  Unfortunately, I think it will take a few hundred years to get there.<br /><br />Anyway, awesome book.  Get it.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I really wanted to love this CD. I really did. Part of me wanted to start this review (in my preparation to writing it) with a Hmmmmmm. Because I just did not know what to say about it.<br /><br />To have a band like TOOL around during these days of very homogenised/pasteurised shelf market processed musical offerings where everyone sounds slightly the same barring the way the singer says \\"you\\" (optional \\"chu\\") is pure luck of the draw. They put so much work into what they do, visually, musicially, artistically, it is so difficult to fault them for anything. They are literally something very hard to find in the music industry. Had this been the late 60's, early 70's, it would be easier to find bands like TOOL roaming around the tundra, eating up all the vegetation, but in the 21st century, TOOL are one of the last of their species. And this species is dwindling if you listen to modern radio and pay attention to the media and what it says is the new link in the food chain. TOOL -- count your blessings in regards to them.<br /><br />This aside, listening to 10,000 Days with eager anticipation because LATERALUS was so amazingly great (and I agree with the reviewer who stated every TOOL release just seemed to keep getting better the further into their career they got) was ..... well .... it just was.<br /><br />First impressions should never be trusted. You should always give something or someone a 2nd, 3rd, 4th chance if possible. You might be missing something first time around. So first impressions left me thinking I loved \\"The Pot\\". But not alot else. And I was disappointed,. But I thought it was me. It might still be me. Maybe I am missing something. Maybe I'm looking too hard for something that just ain't there, or something that I understand now completely which was a mystery to me before. The questions, the questions.<br /><br />After impression 15 (I keep trying with this album) I felt I had favourites from it. But I also had this nagging sensation. It kind of cropped up listening to my two favourite songs. They being \\"Jambi\\" and \\"The Pot\\". During both their \\"solo\\" sections, I sat there wondering, um, what is the difference between Jambi and The Pot here? They were practically interchangeable, and Danny Carey takes the same approach to one as he does the other. And part of me wondered, is it me who notices that this album has a sort of \\"automatic for the masses\\" feel to it, or have TOOL entered into a slight musical/inspirational rut? Maybe it's just me. But my two favourite songs all of a sudden became, the two songs that kinda sound alike for a little while, which makes me wonder what happens in the creative process, and maybe 5 years is too long to put out albums.<br /><br />And after awhile, listening to all the songs, half the time I was saying \\"why\\"? I have no problems with songs being 11 minutes long. If I can sit and listen to Tales From Topographic Oceans by YES and concentrate on 4 songs that each last near or over 20 minutes, AND I'm not particularly a fan of that work preferring CLOSE TO THE EDGE or RELAYER, then TOOL are quite easy compared. 10,000 Days just seemed to have songs that I wondered \\"why\\" a lot. I just couldn't see a reason why this song had to be 8 minutes, or that one 9. Particularly with:<br />Wings For Marie (Pt 1)<br />10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)<br />Those two in particular.<br /><br />I definitely have favourites on this album, they being:<br />Jambi<br />The Pot<br />Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)<br />Rosetta Stoned<br />Right In Two<br /><br />To me, these are all essential TOOL songs. Even with that slight nagging sensation I get with Jambi and The Pot. But Right In Two is something TOOL does incredibly well. And that song \\"feels\\" right. It takes ages to get through it, but you love it regardless, because the minutes are filled with something to listen to, and respect for its talent, and enjoy on multiple layers. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) & Rosetta Stoned are favourites. They just are. I thinkthey're just incredibly interesting, moody pieces. They make you question, they make you curious, they make you wonder what's going on. TOOL - count your blessings in regards to them.<br /><br />I just think this is an album, if I was introducing someone to TOOL, that I wouldn't go with. I don't know if it's me, or if it's TOOL, but something's not right here, and I'd love to get to the bottom of it, so I can look at this album for what it's truly worth. Or maybe I don't need to. I have the other albums to enjoy. But there's something about this album that I feel TOOL didn't do. I expected them to develop and change their sound massively. I don't know why. I just expected a major or at least noticeable departure from where they've been before. Different sounds, textures, different arrangements. I don't know what I was expecting. I just wasn't expecting this. And \\"this\\" made me feel like TOOL was here before in this territory, and the trail has truly been traveled. There were moments (quite a few) that I loved. But there were quite a few that made me say \\"I've heard this before\\". And I don't want to do that with TOOL. I didn't want to do that with Jambi and The Pot. But it happened.<br /><br />Maybe in a couple years I'll say -- ahhh I see where they were headed. But right now, in this moment, I'm thinking TOOL counted the days because they just didn't quite know where they were. It just has a kind of \\"where do we go from here\\" quality about it, this 10,000 Days that I can't shake when listening to it. Hearing them use synthesisers on LATERALUS said they were expanding on how they do what they do. 10,000 Days seems like they stepped back to something pre-Lateralus thinking they missed something back there that they need. Don't know if that makes sense, but it just seems like 10,000 Days is a step-back. Not forward.<br /><br />But it's TOOL. And there are very few like them, if at all, so it's worth it regardless. :)e you curious, they make you wonder what's going on. TOOL - count your blessings in regards to them.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|Having all of my Led Zeppelin on Vinyl this is my first CD of theirs.  All great songs of course, what I wasn't prepared for was the difference in the sound.  All I can say is WOW!<br /><br />This will be a real treat for younger listeners just getting a taste for Led Zeppelin, for the rest of us, it's like listening to them for the first time.
0385334206|4.0|I think Breakfast of Champions can be summed up by this quote from the book:    \\"...there is no order in the universe around us....we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead.\\" (p. 215)    Based on that, you've likely (and correctly) surmised that the tone of the book is largely bleak and pessimistic.  It's also largely plotless and rambles.  However, it's never dull, it will get you thinking, and even while it is pointing out the bleakness and meaninglessness of life, there is a light that shines here that will make you laugh and shake your head at the absolute absurdity of it all.  This isn't Vonnegut's best book (that would be either [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five]] or [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]]) but it is still a must read for anyone who enjoys his mix of pessimism, philosophy and dark humor.  Recommended.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Since I teach a couple courses on the field of medicine at the university level in the United States, I thought it was about time I watched this film. Having watched Michael Moore movies previously, the format for 'Sicko' is no different.  As most others have said, Michael Moore clearly points out a few of the inequities within the American field of medicine.  While some who have commented here say that Michael Moore is giving a very biased, and liberal view, Moore really does nothing more than scratch the service of this issue.  Slanted?  Certainly, but that does not mean what he is presenting is false.  Yes, his focus on particular cases can be argued against, but those that do so miss the entire point of the movie, that is, our health care system in this country is not, . . . healthy.<br /><br />Is it wrong to say that our system is weak?  I find it hard to imagine why Americans are not willing to appreciate that by recognizing a problem, it opens the door to fixing it.  But instead I read people here who give the impression that any critique of America is wrong.  I suggest they read the Declaration of Independence, or for that matter many of the great intellectual minds of our society who warned against arrogance in the face of reality. When the World Health Organization ranks us 37th overall in health care, and when we currently (I think) are ranked 33rd in infant mortality, then something is wrong.  Why not fix it?  Why not learn from all the other countries of the world? That seems pretty smart.<br /><br />The real key for me was the ending of the film when Moore talks about the difference in thinking 'we' instead of 'me'.  We live in a society that lives in this fiction called 'individual responsibility'.  The problem is that we cannot do anything that wasn't influenced in some manner by others.  What is wrong with thinking 'we' first? It seems that in church that is what the priests and preachers are talking about.<br /><br />Moore isn't saying that by going to universal health care that all our problems will go away.  He's talking about caring about others, and in return we make things better for ourselves.  Is Michael Moore a saint?  Is he flawless?  Absolutely not.  But do you throw out the message because you do not like the messenger? Now that would be foolish.<br /><br />The film like all his films, or any films for that matter, only tells a brief story.  If you want to know more, read some of the critiques of American medicine.  Read about the strengths and weaknesses of medicine around the globe.  For anyone to say that American medicine is the envy of people around the world just hasn't paid much attention to what is going on around the world.h care that all our problems will go away.

0156027321|4.0|I love a unique story, and this was certainly different.  This author has tremendous insight into what it takes to survive tragic and seemingly hopeless situations.  Practically the whole story takes place on a lifeboat as a young teen age boy copes on a daily basis with survival, while sharing the boat with a tiger named Richard Parker.  The author pulls off a great ending, also.  This book opened my mind in a way that is hard to describe, but in a positive way.
0805079831|5.0|This book opens the door, for those who might otherwise remain unenlightened (as are most of us 'Westerners' are), on the systematic spread of a rather pernicious disease: the disease of unfettered Capitalism, a disease that will sweep all before it, a disease that will strike down those most unable to defend themselves to facilitate the enrichment of already privileged individuals who see the fulfilment of their life's worth as the oppression of the poor and the (self) aggrandisement of the powerful.    Naomi Klein presents an extremely well researched and documented case. This is a truly riveting read, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons; for these are tales of inflicted suffering, of rampant ideologues who see the abject misery and death of their defenceless victims as no noteworthy impediment to the outworking of their poisonous economic ideals.     How instructive it is, that (to the best of my knowledge) despite the loud bleating from the usual quarters about this 'gratuitious assault on the capitalist economic edifice', that not one, none, no one has taken this author to task in litigation. But then, how could they... possibly!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have had this DVD collection for a couple of years.  I bought it for a friend who had recently developed a 'taste' for British humor.  I told him this will be a feast.  He was not disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think there could've been any TV series more satisfying that Fawlty Towers.  After rewatching these episodes over and over, I still marvel at their story structure and the brilliant comedic situations they managed to come up with.  My personal favorites are 'Communications Problems' and 'The Psychiatrist'.  In addition to the brilliance of John Cleese, the casting of the supportive players was pure genius.<br /><br />These episodes are now over 30 years old, but they still beat anything on TV today.  That's a pretty strong testament to the writing of this classic series.

B000W4KT64|5.0|When I heard this movie came out in the theaters, I was a little unsure that I would like it.  But, after seeing parts of the old Hairspray movie with Ricki Lake and Deborah Harry, I didn't like that version at all.  But, when this one came straight to video, I just had to rent it to see for myself.  And I am glad I did.  Seeing John Travolta dressed in a body suit to be made up like a woman was the funniest part of all and seeing him dance in the outfit.  And Michelle Pfeiffer was even awesome looking too.  Here's a bit of trivia for you..what do John Travolta and Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie both have in common?  ANSWER: They both starred in Grease movies.  So Michelle and John have both been in Grease and Grease 2.  To me, this is Michelle's 2nd musical she's been in, and I think John's been in some others.  And Nikki Blonsky who plays the lead character Tracy Turnblad she the most awesome voice when she sang.  Queen Latifah rocks in some of her musical numbers.  The dance numbers were incredible.  And Christopher Walken does a singing number with John Travolta.  After renting, watching, now I want to go and buy it to my musical collection.  I would advise you do the same. This will be one you won't want to pass up.

B000RL4GS4|5.0|You very rarely hear it anymore, an album (cd for you kids) that grabs you from the start and doesn't let you go.  This is one of the best albums I have heard in 30 years.  Coming from this grizzled vet who appreciates every type of music around.  The last time I felt that type of feeling is when I put on Back and Black and was blown away at the ripe age of 12.  Well friends, this album gave me that feeling.  It was unreal to hear a bunch of young guys rocking out like this.  Runnin' Wild is one of the best rocker songs I've ever heard.  Put the top down, put the foot on the gas cause that's what these songs make you want to do.    I would say the singer is a combination of a Bon Scott/Brian Johnson mix.  Best of both worlds for this AC/DC fan.      These guys are going to be huge when they arrive in the States in 2008.
B000001GRZ|5.0|This recording, compared to other versions of Suites, definitely stands out in the sound quality level. While Fournier's performance is obviously as close to perfection as possible and his instrument amazes with beautiful rich sound, the recording engineers did a great job here as well. While I enjoy all my other Cello Suites albums (Casals, Rostropovich, Cassado), when I desire maximum audio clarity and perfection, I play this Fournier's album.    I see that some reviewers keep accusing Fournier of playing too mechanically, without enough passion and such. I strongly disagree - I'd instead say that other performers use much more expression. Which approach is more appropriate is undeniably matter of personal preference of the listener  - I personally keep enjoying all the great versions of Cello Suites alongside each other.

031286504X|4.0|I've always found the mythology of the vampire and it's relationship to the human psyche to be extremely facinating.  Yet few authors manage to say anything creative about these creatures of the night, and choose instead to portray them merely as either highly sexualized or purely evil caricatures hiding in the shadows from humanity at large.  Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\", however, offers a different take on the traditional vampire tale.  Following a devestating plague, it is Matheson's human protagonist, Robert Neville, who is hated and hunted by the vampire majority.  Alienated from life, from humanity, and the endless plague victims who surround him, he himself becomes a monster.  Relatively safe within the confines of his vampire-proofed shelter, Neville's primary enemies are boredom, loneliness, anger and self-doubt.  He struggles to fill his days with meaning and hope while gradually loosing ground to the vampires who want his blood.<br /><br />Overall, this is a dramatic, suspenseful and chilling story with an unforgettable ending.  The novella's one flaw: it's too short.  I wish Matheson had written more about, for example, the emergence of the vampire plague, Neville's relationship with his wife and Ben Cortman.  Yet, like any good horror novel, much has to be left to the imagination.<br /><br />For people drawn to this novella because of the recent film adaptation staring Will Smith, I think in the end you may be either disappointed by the film or the story on which it was based (depending on which you experience first and your personal tastes).  If you're expecting loads of action, car chases or explosions from this book, then you may be let down.
1400063515|2.0|I purchased this New York Times Bestseller to challenge my brain and increase my knowledge. To some degree, I accomplished both between yawns and nods. Does it really take over three hundred pages to tell us we cannot predict the future? Mr. Taleb convinced me during the first few chapters. Then he told me again and again how intelligent people think they predict the future by pontificating on their knowledge of the past. He gives examples of unplanned outcomes, such as laser surgery and internet access, technology that has had a profound effect on our lives. In several instances, those advancements superceded planned research and development. Okay. I'll buy that. Although I understood the message, I didn't like the book. And I didn't pull out of the stock market before the November 2007 slump because I fell asleep while reading it. A reality check was warranted, so I read other reviewers opinions and became comatose. If The Black Swan was targeted to a lay audience, it missed the mark ... by a long shot. Only the elite intelligencia could wallow in the 'isms, and 'stans with glee.<br /><br />For what it's worth,<br />D. A. Welch

I did think it stretched things a little when they walk across ocean floors where predators could get to them, but none seem to attack them. It had me thinking about how I could protect my family during a zombie attack, and you can't ask much more from a book than to get you involved in it. Overall, it was a unique and well written story.
B0007OY2P8|2.0|Overall, I found this version of Jane Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey\\" disappointing. While no one element was completely horrible, several factors combined to make this the worst screen adaptation of an Austen novel I've seen to date.    The screenplay was scanty where I wanted more detail. The first half of the book, where Catherine enjoys Bath and becomes acquainted with the other characters was glossed over, without giving any of the characters a chance to emerge as believable. The time poured into the ridiculously repetitive dream sequences might have been better spent developing some of the other characters to the point where Catherine's relationship with them might have been believable. A few tender moments of friendship between Catherine and the mercenary Isabella would have given me at least some reason to believe that Catherine might have voluntarily spent some time in her company. John Thorpe was presented as an evil kind of buffoon, which made me wonder why the sensible James Morland would have befriended him at all. Even the relationship between Henry Tilney and Catherine was rendered implausible by the omission of his character development. The addition of the Marchioness was ridiculous. There was no need to invent her, as Austen already provided the General with enough flaws. The latter half, at Northanger Abbey itself, was not handled adroitly. The developing friendship between Eleanor and Catherine was never allowed to show, and Henry's tenderness toward Catherine was completely absent. The subtlety and understated humor that defines Austen's work was completely absent.    The direction could have been handled better. Everything was overly dramatic, with no trace of subtlety anywhere. Catherine was an idiot, Tilney a rebelious younger son, Isabella a devious fortune hunter, Thorpe an unalloyed villain, General Tilney a stern yet capricious patriarch. I blame the directing, here, rather than the acting, because there were times that it looked like the actors, left to their own devices, would have put on a more credible performance.    As for the acting, all I can say is that they did their best within the bounds set them by the director. Robert Hardy gave an outstanding performance, of course, and the second star I gave was by his merit alone.    The soundtrack is completely inappropriate. It is disjointed, jarring, and modern. All in all, it was a distraction rather than an enhancement.    The costumes were fine, although the Marchioness, who had no reason to be there anyway, was a bit of a joke.    All in all, I felt that the movie missed the point. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" was meant to satirize the gothic novel, not exemplify it.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I saw the first ever Eagles concert as they opened for Procol Harum at the Santa Monica Civic auditorium decades ago, and have been a huge fan ever since.    This concert DVD is spellbinding. The sound quality is flawless. The Eagles work hard to polish their mesmerizing harmonies. A full band, with 2 drummers, four horn players (one also a violininst), two keyboard players and a bunch of guitars all mixed perfectly create a big, beautiful sound. This is the kind of DVD you dream about if you have a great sound system.    The visual quality is unmatched. When a musician does a solo, there is a closeup of that player, and when a singer sings, that's who you see. The lighting is tasteful, never interfering with or distracting from the performance. If you have a good, large wide screen TV, this is the kind of DVD you dream about.    If you are a Joe Walsh fan, you'll love this show all the more. His \\"One day at a time\\" is one of the best tracks on the disk. Not a slow, whining, self-pitying sobriety song, but rather a driving, rockin', brutal self assessment and solution to alcoholism. A masterpiece.    And finally, back-up musician Stuart Smith will never get enough credit so I'm giving him gobs of it here. He is essentially the lead guitarist, although Walsh \\"officially\\" holds the title. Stuart plays all those fantastic solos and fills of Eagles now gone - Bernie Leadon and Don Felder, plus all the fantastic guitar heard on Henley's solo material. I can't say enough about this guy. Although he's not playing his own stuff, he so beautifully, accurately, and tastefully plays all the subtle and not-subtle-at-all guitar parts that are so absolutely necessary to a great Eagles show, he should be in the center of the stage.

B000005ILF|4.0|Given world enough and time, I likely would have been a huge fan of Sting.  I was pushing my mid-twenties when I first heard the Police, and while I didn't actually care for \\"Roxanne\\" on the first listen, I did come to like that song and just about the entirety of the band's reggae influenced oeuvre.  Over the years, I kept sampling their work--if not passionately following their career.  When Sting went solo, I pretty much followed the same pattern--listening attentively to this release, overlooking that.  There was little rhyme or reason to the pattern, just the typical getting involved in the cares and concerns of adult life and finding myself doing something more like dabbling into music (and all the other artforms--film and literature-- I had cared so passionately about in my high school and college years)than following it passionately.    The rap on Sting as being a bit full-of-himself and pretentious probably didn't help matters.  Of course, I was always quick to defend favorites from my own coming-of-age years against the same charges.  I should have realized that pomposity can co-exist with real talent, and sometimes you cheat yourself by failing to overlook that particular failing in an artist.    Listening to this album more than ten years after its orignial release, I find it pretty damn good--and if the fans are calling THIS one a lesser effort, then I had better make haste to catch up on all his work that I've missed out on over the past decade or so.  There's not a bad track on this CD, and although there were at least a few moments that sounded a little too familiar.  The 'soulful' ending of \\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot,\\"  seemed awfully imitative of the fade out on \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free,\\" for instance--and the follow up track \\"I Was Brought to My Senses\\" starts off a little too close to \\"Fields of Gold,\\" I thought, for comfort.  But ever the sly dog, Sting pulls a musical switcheroo on the latter track and brings it swiftly from pastoral folk to smooth (if equally pastoral) lite jazz.  (And, no, I don't think that's a bad thing.)    Those who even got the \\"correct\\" interpretation of \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (the ones who would know better than to have that tune play at their wedding) know that Sting can be a bit of creepy storyteller.  Of course, just as I would never have assumed that he was capable of stalking a love interest, I rest assured that he would never really wantonly shoot down a total stranger, as the narrator of \\"I Hung My Head\\" (far and away this album's eeriest tune does).  He's telling a story--and a disturbing one it is.    From what I can see, it's probably always a mistake to view Sting's lyrics as being autobiographical in any sense.  I do recall reading a few tidbits here and there that his marriage to Trudie Styler has had its ups and downs, but I wouldn't assume that his touching portrait of a betrayed husband and father in \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Help Crying\\" is based on his own life (and if it is, I'm not sure I need to know that anyway).  But it remains an insightful portrait of the shifting mental states that anyone caught in that situation would likely go through (bitter denial, anger and, eventually, some accomodation to the reality of the situation).  Sting creates a mini-movie in that song--and pulls it off with aplomb.    In fact, I would imagine that I'm scarcely the only one who sometimes thinks of Sting tunes in cinematic terms.  The two songs cited above brought to mind to (much more recent films).  \\"I Hung My Head\\" made me thing of BABEL, and \\"I Hung My Head\\" brought to mind the very disturbing LITTLE CHILDREN.  For a three minute song to even begin to evoke a masterful full-length cinematic release strikes me as a real achievement.  Obviously, a songwriter can only suggest the outlines of a story that a film or novel could flesh out in much greater detail, but to his credit, many of Mr. Sumner's tales seem pretty much complete in and of themselves.    It's hardto come up with a better illustration of the pain of divorced dads, say, than the pithy lines, \\"The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream...What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes.\\"    It's not really armchair psychoanalysis to note the running theme of abandonment and isolation that run through the album.  One can assume that these are themes that are close to the songwriter's heart without assuming them to be truly autobiographical.  The desolate imagery of the initial track \\"Hounds of Winter\\" (which became the sole composition from this album to also be included on the 2001 live release ALL THIS TIME) speaks more obliquely than some of the other songs about the pain of separation.  It's bleak, wintry and it sets the tone and suggests a theme for the album that is sombre but not overwhelmingly grim.    I like this record...a lot.  And I find--belatedly--that I can certainly forgive the artist his occasional pretensions.  How many albums can you think of whose opening lyrics also serve as the disc's coda.  No, I can't think of too many either, but it seems like a very 60s or early 70s kind of ploy, the kind of concept album device that--at least conceptually--makes you want to cringe.  But the Stingmeister pulls it off with a leger de main that makes you forget any reservations about that (or about his French!).
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I first saw this concert 15 years ago on HBO.  I was mesmerized and have never forgotten it. I recorded it on VHS of course, but someone lifted my tape years ago and I have been hoping over the years for a DVD release. So I finally got my DVD a few months ago. I finally watched it with my Thanksgiving guests. (I have now have to order 2 more DVDs) The performances have certainly withstood the test of time. Because screens were smaller in '92, I didn't notice how much lip-synching was involved. In '92 I marvelled at how MJ's vocals were so strong considering his continous choreography.  Watching on my 60\\" TV, I no longer have to marvel at that. :(.  But to be totally fair, singer/dancers all have back up vocals to help them through their dance routines. So, MJ is forgiven.
B000P7V46C|5.0|On AND THEN THERE WERE THREE, Genesis, after losing guitarist Steve Hackett, pare down to a trio of drummer/vocalist Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford, and the result is not only their first major hit single (\\"Follow You, Follow Me\\"), but yet another great album to boot. Without Peter Gabriel's stage costumes to draw attention, Genesis has now, since A TRICK OF THE TAIL, been able to let the music do the talking, and have also translated well into the video age. There's still some progressive flourishes on this CD, so it is a bit transitional, but they've been sublimated into great pop songs. If you enjoy progressive pop-rock, you must own this CD/DVD.
0375842381|5.0|This is an excellent series that must be read. It does no more harm then any Bible Story or Narnia does, all of which are based on pure fantasy. Those insecure with their own belief system will of course find the series disturbing; after all they are stuck in a mind set that any questioning or blantant opposition to their religion is to not exist. However, that is not the case now days and HIS DARK MATERIALS could not have been made into a film series at a better time.
0446577391|5.0|This continuation of The Collectors is a great book.  Two plots are woven seemlessly together in Stone Cold.  If you have read the first two in the series (Camel Club and The Collectors) then this is a must read.  There is a ton of background information on Oliver Stone.  If you haven't read them, I suggest you read them prior to starting Stone Cold.  This book really left me wanting more of the Camel Club.  Let's hope we see another one.    Fight On!    PS - I even think the cover art is really good.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was one of those listeners who thought that Radiohead's talent and vigor ended with \\"Creep.\\"  I bought The Bends a couple of years after it came out and I just never took to it.  It wasn't until way before OK Computer even came out that I listened to The Bends and again and I was blown away.  How could I have NOT listened to this more?!    Radiohead has a knack for being one of those bands where you have to live with the album a little bit and then let it all in.  I now think the The Bends is one of the best albums of the 90s that a lot of people missed.    Then came OK Computer.  At 1st listen I liked it but it never grabbed me.  The same kind of thing that happened with The Bends but to a lesser degree.  I remember I was sitting in my office at work and I was listening to OK Computer while doing my work and it was on the song \\"Let Down\\" that OK Computer decided to open up for me.      This album simply knocked me off my feet.  It was almost like a domino effect.  After each listen I grew to really love this album and still do.  It no doubt will be a classic and will be the pinnacle of Radiohead's career, the album that made it's own music history.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I love torchwood it is the best show.  If you like Dr Who you will love Torchwood it is great.
B000683VI4|5.0|My daughter and I watched this together. I'm an old softy, known to cry over AT&T commercials, so my sobs weren't unexpected, but my stoic daughter was in tears, too.  A great movie with a lot to say about love, passion and life-long devotion!  Also, contrary to the usual reality, this movie is far superior to the book upon which it was based.
B000W4KT64|2.0|Hairspray really disappointed me.<br /><br />The humor was consistently crude, and more mean spirited than clever.  The music, though peppy and upbeat, was unmemorable.  The costumes and sets were beautifully 1960's, but the way people talked and behaved reminded me of sit coms from the 1990's.  It didn't charm me.<br /><br />For a film about fighting prejudice, it certainly reinforced a lot of negative stereotypes!  Although African-Americans and overweight people were championed, it was open season on high school teachers, fundamentalist Christians, the police, television executives, and beauty pageant winners.<br /><br />The film did have a few good moments.  For one thing, that little Taylor Parks sure can dance!  She lit up the screen!  Wow!<br /><br />But that's not enough for me to recommend the movie in general.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Maybe `Magic' will not be remembered with Springteen's other classics, `Born to Run,' `Born in the U.S.A.' or `The River,' but it is, otherwise, one of the most gratifying albums he's ever released.  A lesser classic, but often his most immediate, much of the music is an update to Bruce's New Wave offerings from `Born in the USA'.     Pleasing power pop comes out as ear candy--if you could ever call the Boss's music that--on the immediate \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" a song about satellite radio, reminiscent of the lesser \\"57 Channels (and Nothin' On)\\" from `Human Touch'.  Easily as addictive are the pop hooks from \\"You'll Be Comin' Down,\\" \\"Your Own Worst Enemy,\\" and (especially) \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\".  \\"The Last to Die\\" is delivered propulsively and with a poignant message.  Vintage Bruce is tapped from \\"Livin' in the Future,\\" with Clarence Clemons' fiery saxophone brought to the fore.  To ensure variety, Bruce adds the quietly sublime title track, more on the wavelength of  \\"I'm on Fire,\\" and \\"Devil's Arcade\\" gives some folk that sounds like an updated song from `Nebraska'.  There's also an unlisted track that gives a somber sendoff that is still worthy of the rest of the album.      If I don't wear this album out on my car C.D. player, it will be great luck.  His new offering brings 'Magic' wherever I go.
0307237699|3.0|I read this book with \\"candidate Obama\\" in mind.  He makes some good observations about the process of government under the current administration.  He also offers opinions on how to return our government back to civility toward one another.  My only criticizm is that he writes as though he is teaching the reader the entire history and content of The Consitution, thus doubling the amount of words necessary to make his point.  Frankly, I found parts of this book boring.
B000VNMMQQ|4.0|If you love the 'Die Hard' franchise, you won't be disappointed by the latest installment.  I never tire of movies that are generated from plots about computers, so in the software and the hardware, the movie gets it right.  This time a terrorist is targeting hackers around the country, planting viruses in computers that detonate.  His motives are revealed later in the movie, but his maneuvering at his underground headquarters spread to sabotaging communications, energy, and traffic.  One of the most innovative scenes is when chief terrorist, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) accompanied by cat-like siren sidekick (Maggie Q),creates chaos in an underground tunnel with traffic sorting out with the lights out.  (Often the whole affair comes off like a high-tech update of children's story `Gus the Firefly'.)      Enter John McClane (Willis) who makes harrowing a weasel word for his escape with targeted hacker, (Justin Long) a startled petty criminal who becomes McClane's sidekick to restore order to the Y2K-like deliberations.  On the sidelines is McClane's daughter who is predictable bait and McClane's best motivation in a way reminiscent of 'Armageddon' (another Willis' movie).      The mayhem keeps the adrenaline rushing, and, although Willis's smirks and funny lines are fewer and farther between, 'Live Free or Die Hard' shows there's still some new memory in the series' hard drive.
B0000024JA|5.0|i couldnt believe the 2 star reviews on this wu banga. definately one of the clans shining moments, try and compare this album to any other of its time...you cant because it is so original and genius, the reason for the low quality of the beats is because the rzas studio was destroyed by a flood so all the masters were ruined, and they redid beats and lyrics in a short period of time to make deadline.great album start to finish. if youre a wu fan that only likes cream and method man and gravel pit, keep ridin dick, but if you youre a real head, recognize the dopeness and originality of this record and appreciate it for what it is...CLASSIC.
B000002LLC|5.0|When i had this cd in my hands, i said: what is this? Not commercial music except Vogue or maybe Hanky Panky. Now I know is Madonna in one of her several personas, in her style, this cd is a masterpiece for me. Strike a pose and buy it.
B000Y179KO|5.0|A group of talented musicians that bring a rarely seen  combination of outstanding vocals, powerful lyrics, great  instrumentals, and a harmonious sound that is unmatched  in the music world today. To pick a favorite song from this  album would be impossible. However,from CD #1 songs 4,7 and  10 are all great. On CD #2, song 2 (the title track) and song  6 would get my vote. Buy this CD ! I can guarantee you  that  you will not be disappointed.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I will write in portuguese, my language.  Excelente performance das meninas. Uma afinação segura e por que não dizer perfeita. A seleção de músicas, algumas desconhecidos aqui no Brasil, não deixam de ser belas e de facil assimilação. Papabéns também à osquestra e arranjos feitos pelo maestro. Uma nota a parte para violinista que sempre se apresenta com perfeição, beleza e doçura.  Recomendo este DVD com máximo empenho.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|To woo the village beauty Victoria (Sienna Miller), shy grocery shop boy Tristan (Charlie Cox) goes across the wall that divides the two worlds, and travels to get the fallen star that is far, far away. The beautiful star turns out a beautiful, perky girl Yvaine (Claire Danes), to whom he is gradually attracted, and vice versa. But he is not the only one who is after her; an evil witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) is also trying to get the heart of Yvaine, too, all too literally.    Neil Gaiman's fatasy world comes alive with top-notch cast and great photography. Gaiman's novel gets faster and tighter for film adaptation, especially the earlier part. The film has less sexual nuances, no expletives (so no f--- word from Yvaine when landing on the Earth), and more actions and much more scenes from the \\"flying pirates\\" led by Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro).     The film directed by Matthew Vaughn (critically acclaimed \\"Layer Cake\\") has many original ideas greatly helped by amazing visuals, healthy amount of humor and well-drawn characters, but the originality here includes Robert DeNiro dancing \\"Can-Can\\" in women's clothes, which is not definitely in Gaiman's book. Whether you like it or not would wholly depend on yourself.    \\"Stardust\\" is an enchanting fantasy story full of adventures and romance. The film's tone is sometimes uneven and those who have already read the book might miss some part of the book, or lament several changes (Victoria is not just a village coquette, a more complicated character in the original novel, for instance), but the film's thrills and romances are genuine ones.
B000051VWW|5.0|I love Sade's music - have most of her CDs and I have my favorite songs on each.  This whole CD, however, just completely blows me away.  The melodies (as always) are haunting and beautiful.  I think my hands down favorites on this CD are \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\" and \\"Slave Song\\" but they are all fabulous.  Just beautiful.  Hopefully we will not have to wait as long for her next release!
B000UR9T8C|2.0|It is sad to see a great movie went downhill.  After enjoying the first 2 Spider-Man, people have great expectation of the latest story, especially Spider-Man's arch-villain Venom is in it.      The problem with Spiderman 3 is the director trying to jam too much into the movie.  Too many characters, too little time, and it ends up that non of the characters has enough development into them. Viewers can't not relate to their pain or why they they fight.  The end fight is pretty much meaningless  after learning the story of Sandman at the end; people would wonder why Sandman even bother to setup the end fight with Spidy at first.
B00005LANG|5.0|This set includes the great songs that helped Bob Marley officially cross over to mainstream, and bring reggae with him. Although reggae music is still not as prominent as it could be, this set certainly helped it along. It has some of each type of music. Jah reggae, dance and rock. If you are a reggae fan this is a stable for your library.

I feel that the<br /> basic principles presented in the simple story can be applied to<br />any person in any walk of life. It's about setting goals, achieving<br />them, and learning along the way on life's journey. It hit home with<br />me. I feel that anyone will derive meaning from this book. I highly<br />recommend it.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Finally they have released this entire show with the proper sound quality! I have been waiting for them to do this for years and I do appreciate the effort. On the negative side however, unfortunately they decided to put the edited songs from the new soundtrack of the movie (done to match the visuals of the film) on to the CD?? This was just plain lazy and insulting. This wasn't even done back in 76!! There should have been no limit to what they could have put on the CDs. They didn't have to match the audio to the film footage so they should have re-mastered the best available performances, in their entirety, from all the available 73 Madison Square Garden shows into one complete show on a 3 CD set! Instead they just did a direct transfer from the re-mastered Movie and new songs on DVD II to the CD in the original running order of the concert (this is why I give four stars instead of five for the CD and Five stars for the DVD). Back in 76 They chose better song versions for the album then what was in the movie because they could, and some of these performances are possibly their very best live versions of some of these songs and far better than the ones on this current CD or DVD (for instance compare this new version CD/DVD to the older version Song Remains the Same CD/Album of Celebration Day which had Page's greatest realized live guitar solo ever for this song and then compare the older audio version of the middle section and Jimmy's guitar passage/solo on No Quarter to this new version. There is absolutely no comparison and this was arguably one of Page's greatest live solos ever-bold statement I know but true- , and the comparisons of whole lotta love from new to the old CD/album is an absolute joke! All of these old versions are now completely lost in this new shuffle as a few examples- Inexcusable!! Hang on to the old CD/Album!) .     This all being said, we must appreciate that Zeppelin is even trying to fix up and put out some of their priceless material officially and with superior sound these days (for profit or not). So in summary the performances we do have here are different from the ones released in 76. The new additions are greatly welcomed, the sound is better across the board, However some of these new versions of songs are not even close to as good as the old album versions that were some of the best live Zeppelin realizations of these songs ever and that have now been lost. Overall though we are talking about Led Zeppelin during their peak tour and of some of there best performances ever (proven in detail below!!). This alone will hopefully and finally put these incredible performances in their deserving historical place, perspective and give them their do justice. This brings me to my next important point.     Don't listen to the negative reviewers calling themselves Zeppelin fans. I can tell from what many have written that they don't know Jack squat about Zeppelin or what they were like live throughout their career. They are merely clowns dressed in sheep's clothing wanting to hear themselves talk about something they know very little about (their extravagantly large red floppy shoes give them away).     Led Zeppelin has been my favorite band for the past 29 years and I have read, studied and listened to their entire career (every tour of live performances included) in depth. I will tell you in simple chapter and verse that this show (culmination of shows at Madison Square Garden at the end of their 1973 tour) is incredibly underrated and has been horribly misrepresented and maligned over the years by a few people that are full of hot air. I don't care how many of these sheople/clowns try to say that these were sub par performances (even Page himself has tried to insinuate this for unknown reasons in the past and at other times he has claimed otherwise), I'm here to tell you, as an actually well educated die hard Zeppelin fan, it is absolutely not true!! This has just been self perpetuating opinions overthe years from hot winded nobodies that really don't know what the hell they're talking about following along with what a few other people have said before them.     Back in the day (1976 and forward) when this movie and the soundtrack were actually released it was one of the most popular live albums and movies (midnight movies) on the market. It was constantly listened to, watched, talked about and absolutely revered by music heads and fans throughout my junior high and high school days in southern California-all the way into the early eighties (It still played at the Midnight Movie into the early 80's!). I have listened to all the great unreleased live Zep performances and proclaimed greatest Zep shows and I have to yell, from the mountain top to all, that these performances from The Song Remains the Same of: \\"Dazed and Confused (the old album/cd version)\\", \\"No Quarter\\" (the old album/cd version), \\"The song remains the same\\", \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"Celebration Day\\" (the old soundtrack/cd version), \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Whole lotta love (the old album/cd version)\\" and the recent release of \\"The Ocean\\" are still some of the best, if not \\"The\\" best live versions of these songs ever -period!!     To categorically back this opinion up here's a brief, \\"true\\" story, of the actual live history of Led Zeppelin for those who would like to learn a little something:     (1968-1970) Led Zeppelin live from 1968 to 1970 was powerful, fierce, raw and unlike anything that anyone had ever heard or seen. Zeppelin during this time toured around the world constantly, devastating audiences and honing their skills and musical catalog along the way. They were new, hungry and building a loyal live and album (Zeppelin I, II, and III) following as they blew everyone away in their path. However, instrumentally the band was still developing. Plants voice was incredible and the Rhythm engine of Bonham and Jones was amazing and would never disappoint throughout Zeppelin's career yet they were still young and developing their craft. As incredible as Page was at that time he was still in progress as a guitarist, as a musical visionary, in his image/stage presence, and in his eventual forge into musical territory that had never been blazed before. Page was also still in his climb to becoming the ultimate guitar legend/hero and the unequalled technical and most innovative guitar player of his time. This pinnacle wouldn't be achieved by Mr. Page until 1971 and through 1973 (this can be witnessed from unofficial live recordings between 1971 and 1973 or from \\"How the West Was Won\\" 1972). The Concerts from 68 to 70, put into proper historical perspective, are absolutely amazing relative to everything else at the time yet the band as a whole and the material had not reached its next or ultimate level. Page had a vision and he was about to lead himself and this band to greater heights than any guitarist or band had ever achieved.       (1971-1972) Led Zeppelin reached a level of frightening instrumental machinery by 1971. The band members had all honed their skills from countless live performances and non stop touring and recording from 68 onward to the point of perfection as individual musicians and as a cohesive musical unit (Each member of Zeppelin would later be considered one of the very best musicians/vocalists for each of their individual crafts across the board). Zeppelin continued to hone this musical power and devastating musical machinery conquering all audiences in their path around the world during their 71 and 72 tours (as \\"How the West Was Won\\" can attest from 1972 and any other recordings you can find from 71 to 72). This was Led Zeppelin at their instrumental best. Their reputation was larger, their audiences were larger, as was their catalog of styles and songs to choose from (Now touring behind the fourth biggest selling album of all time!!- Zeppelin IV). At this time they had honed their stage presence, their cohesiveness and their individual musical prowess to a point that would never be equaled again in their career. Plants voice reached its peak in this era. He would never sing with as much range, control, power or clarity again and along with Pages peak of sheer virtuosity, speed, fluidity, and confidence of playing they had no equals in the rock world instrumentally during this era. Jones and Bonham never failed as one of the very best rhythm sections in rock throughout the Zeppelin Career. Jones and Bonham were always able to match what was coming from the front men, to play up or play down to whatever was coming from Page and Plant. Zeppelin were four pistons in perfect harmony by 71 - 72 and performances from this era can only be described as ferocious, devastating and mind blowing to audiences around the world. Zeppelin's legend, popularity and live reputation had been solidified here.       (1973) The 1973 tour can only be defined as Superstardom. This tour was huge, electric and the band was revered as nothing short of gods at this time. This was Led Zeppelin riding their reputation of being the most successful rock band in the world in record sales, their recording catalog (now incorporating the great \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), and from their legend as a live act that they had developed through countless tours up to 1972. The 1973 world tour broke box office attendance records and would be the pinnacle of Zeppelin live as far as their stage persona, rock star status/mystique, catalog of albums/songs to choose from, their realization of their live song structures, the size of venues and audiences, and their ability to still be able to capture the tail end of their absolute instrumental power and peak and play at the top of their game. This was Zeppelin at their most electric -The world's biggest rock stars, flying around in their own private jumbo jet to the world's biggest sellout shows and venues. Plants voice had changed by this tour and did not quite have the power, range or clarity of 1972, JimmyPage at this time was considered the greatest guitarist in the world and the pressure also began to show on him at times during this tour. Though the instrumental machinery had slowed down a bit, the prowess and power was still there for much of this tour. They were still at the top of their instrumental game more times than not and the band also wielded a bigger legacy, legend, mystique and catalog of albums/songs to choose from. The band had also refined the set list and the structure of live versions of songs to their most realized and refined at this stage of their live career. Also, Zeppelin's further developed rock star stage presence/energy of 73 combined with the energy of the 73 audiences was never at a higher level. This magic chemistry mixed with all the reasons given above gives you some of the most satisfying and quintessential Zeppelin performances of all time. When people think of Zeppelin live in the prime of their career, the 1973 version of Zeppelin is what most people envision. Now to my point about the Song Remains the Same.     I have heard many performances from the 1973 tour and there may be shows with more energy or have certain versions of songs that are unsurpassed yet there are truly very few moments from any other 73 Zeppelin shows that rival many of the songs captured at the end of this tour at Madison Square Garden for the \\"Song Remains the Same\\". For instance: Rock and Roll, Celebration Day (the old CD/album version), The Song Remains the Same, The Rain Song, No Quarter (the old version), Dazed and Confused, Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love (the old CD/album version). These are hands down some of the best realized and performed versions of these songs captured live anywhere and from any time-period!       (1975) Led Zeppelin didn't tour again until 1975 (it had been two years!). The Led Zeppelin 1975 tour was a tour of great imagery, mystery and anticipation for audiences that had built Zeppelin up into something beyond legend or even as gods. However, this popularity, the resultant pressure and drug use over the years (mostly by Jimmy and Drinking by Bonzo), and the long lay off from touring had taken its toll on the greatest live band of all time. As Composers and song writers their legacy was still only growing due to their incredible double album released this same year (touring on Physical Graffiti - arguably their greatest album ever), and their imagery from this tour is at times unequalled due to the famous \\"black dragon suite\\" warn by Page, the even longer hair worn by Plant and Page, and the larger stage shows (the first time use of lasers even-a new effect for the time) during this tour etc. However, the band was older, slower and had lost some of its instrumental prowess and pure power machinery that they once had. Plants voice was far removed from the quality it once had only 2 years prior. Page was now battling with a heroin addiction that took its toll from show to show on his guitar playing that only two years prior seemed to be unstoppable and was unequaled from 71-73. This tour was marked by some magic shows that were unfortunately the exception and not the rule at some of their favorite haunts such as Long Beach, The LA Forum, MSG and moments at the end of the tour during their stand at Earls Court in England. Although many magic moments were captured, the shows were instrumentally slower, less technically proficient, and lacked the energy and power that Zeppelin once controlled. Things would never be the same for Led Zeppelin ever again.       (1977) Led Zeppelin toured America for the last time in 1977. Zeppelin hadn't toured since 75 and the lay off again showed more times than not. There were again some magical shows and moments, most notably at certain stands at the bands favorite stomping grounds such as: The LA Forum, Long Beach and Madison Square Garden once again. Their reputation and audiences were larger than life itself at this time. Tragically however, JimmyPage was battling some serious drug addictions, most notably his heroin addiction. Pages playing could go from close to his hey day of 71-73 to absolutely embarrassing from night to night. There were shows when you wondered if page could even hold up his guitar, much less play it. Plants voice was at times actually better than in the 1975 tour yet the performances as a whole could be shaky with a few high lighted exceptional shows along the way. The band was blowing audiences away at this time from pure reputation and status. Much like the Beatles making audience members pass out without even playing a note back in the 60s. Listening to performances from the 1977 tour, you have to really search to find a few great shows from this tour that can even compare to the power and virtuosity of Zeppelin between 71 and 73. This tour was also cut short due to the tragic death of Robert Plant's son.       (1979-1980) Zeppelin would not play again until they played two warm up shows in Copenhagen Denmark in 1979 in preparation for their two huge festival shows at Knebworth in 79 and then the final European shows in 1980 before Bonham's death. Continued Drug addiction and lay offs only further steered the once mighty Zep downward. Although the band gave it their best effort and put up some very admirable fights (shows), none of these shows can truly compare to the power and devastation these four highly tuned pistons could pump out back in 73 and prior to 70/71.     This brings us back to why these Madison Square Garden shows at the peak of the overall greatest band in the world's career and possibly some of the peaks of the 73 tour itself are so, so priceless and underappreciated. Don't listen to the naysayers (remember, look for their large floppy red shoes) and now go and listen to these treasured performances from the hands down greatest Rock Band of all time with fresh ears, a new perspective and with complete reverence my friends! Maybe in the future we can only hope for acomplete best of performance from the entire stand at Madison Square Garden 73 in a full, uncut 3 CD set. Until that time however, we should all appreciate that Zeppelin is at least finally trying to put some of their priceless, timeless material, that has been locked away and hidden in their vaults for all these many years, out to the public over the past few years. Keep it coming and thank you!
B000Y179KO|2.0|It's nice, it's pleasant, it has great harmonies and unfortunately is as boring as paint! Sorry to all the die hard Eagles fans out there but after 28 years I just expected sooooo much more.   This is so middle of the road that I drove over my copy before I fell asleep at the wheel!
B000VWYNNW|4.0|Finally they have released this entire show with the proper sound quality! I have been waiting for them to do this for years and I do appreciate the effort. On the negative side however, unfortunately they decided to put the edited songs from the new soundtrack of the movie (done to match the visuals of the film) on to the CD?? This was just plain lazy and insulting. This wasn't even done back in 76!! There should have been no limit to what they could have put on the CDs. They didn't have to match the audio to the film footage so they should have re-mastered the best available performances, in their entirety, from all the available 73 Madison Square Garden shows into one complete show on a 3 CD set! Instead they just did a direct transfer from the re-mastered Movie and new songs on DVD II to the CD in the original running order of the concert (this is why I give four stars instead of five for the CD and Five stars for the DVD). Back in 76 They chose better song versions for the album then what was in the movie because they could, and some of these performances are possibly their very best live versions of some of these songs and far better than the ones on this current CD or DVD (for instance compare this new version CD/DVD to the older version Song Remains the Same CD/Album of Celebration Day which had Page's greatest realized live guitar solo ever for this song and then compare the older audio version of the middle section and Jimmy's guitar passage/solo on No Quarter to this new version. There is absolutely no comparison and this was arguably one of Page's greatest live solos ever-bold statement I know but true- , and the comparisons of whole lotta love from new to the old CD/album is an absolute joke!  All of these old versions are now completely lost in this new shuffle as a few examples- Inexcusable!! Hang on to the old CD/Album!) .     This all being said, we must appreciate that Zeppelin is even trying to fix up and put out some of their priceless material officially and with superior sound these days (for profit or not). So in summary the performances we do have here are different from the ones released in 76. The new additions are greatly welcomed, the sound is better across the board, However some of these new versions of songs are not even close to as good as the old album versions that were some of the best live Zeppelin realizations of these songs ever and that have now been lost. Overall though we are talking about Led Zeppelin during their peak tour and of some of there best performances ever (proven in detail below!!). This alone will hopefully and finally put these incredible performances in their deserving historical place, perspective and give them their do justice. This brings me to my next important point.     Don't listen to the negative reviewers calling themselves Zeppelin fans. I can tell from what many have written that they don't know Jack squat about Zeppelin or what they were like live throughout their career. They are merely clowns dressed in sheep's clothing wanting to hear themselves talk about something they know very little about (their extravagantly large red floppy shoes give them away).     Led Zeppelin has been my favorite band for the past 29 years and I have read, studied and listened to their entire career (every tour of live performances included) in depth. I will tell you in simple chapter and verse that this show (culmination of shows at Madison Square Garden at the end of their 1973 tour) is incredibly underrated and has been horribly misrepresented and maligned over the years by a few people that are full of hot air. I don't care how many of these sheople/clowns try to say that these were sub par performances (even Page himself has tried to insinuate this for unknown reasons in the past and at other times he has claimed otherwise), I'm here to tell you, as an actually well educated die hard Zeppelin fan, it is absolutely not true!! This has just been self perpetuating opinions over the years from hot winded nobodies that really don't know what the hell they're talking about following along with what a few other people have said before them.     Back in the day (1976 and forward) when this movie and the soundtrack were actually released it was one of the most popular live albums and movies (midnight movies) on the market. It was constantly listened to, watched, talked about and absolutely revered by music heads and fans throughout my junior high and high school days in southern California-all the way into the early eighties (It still played at the Midnight Movie into the early 80's!). I have listened to all the great unreleased live Zep performances and proclaimed greatest Zep shows and I have to yell, from the mountain top to all, that these performances from The Song Remains the Same of: \\"Dazed and Confused (the old album/cd version)\\", \\"No Quarter\\" (the old album/cd version), \\"The song remains the same\\", \\"The Rain Song\\", \\"Celebration Day\\" (the old soundtrack/cd version), \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Whole lotta love (the old album/cd version)\\" and the recent release of \\"The Ocean\\" are still some of the best, if not \\"The\\" best live versions of these songs ever -period!!     To categorically back this opinion up here's a brief, \\"true\\" story, of the actual live history of Led Zeppelin for those who would like to learn a little something:     (1968-1970) Led Zeppelin live from 1968 to 1970 was powerful, fierce, raw and unlike anything that anyone had ever heard or seen. Zeppelin during this time toured around the world constantly, devastating audiences and honing their skills and musical catalog along the way. They were new, hungry and building a loyal live and album (Zeppelin I, II, and III) following as they blew everyone away in their path. However, instrumentally the band was still developing. Plants voice was incredible and the Rhythm engine of Bonham and Jones was amazing and would never disappoint throughout Zeppelin's career yet they were still young and developing their craft. As incredible as Page was at that time he was still in progress as a guitarist, as a musical visionary, in his image/stage presence, and in his eventual forge into musical territory that had never been blazed before. Page was also still in his climb to becoming the ultimate guitar legend/hero and the unequalled technical and most innovative guitar player of his time. This pinnacle wouldn't be achieved by Mr. Page until 1971 and through 1973 (this can be witnessed from unofficial live recordings between 1971 and 1973 or from \\"How the West Was Won\\" 1972). The Concerts from 68 to 70, put into proper historical perspective, are absolutely amazing relative to everything else at the time yet the band as a whole and the material had not reached its next or ultimate level. Page had a vision and he was about to lead himself and this band to greater heights than any guitarist or band had ever achieved.       (1971-1972) Led Zeppelin reached a level of frightening instrumental machinery by 1971. The band members had all honed their skills from countless live performances and non stop touring and recording from 68 onward to the point of perfection as individual musicians and as a cohesive musical unit (Each member of Zeppelin would later be considered one of the very best musicians/vocalists for each of their individual crafts across the board). Zeppelin continued to hone this musical power and devastating musical machinery conquering all audiences in their path around the world during their 71 and 72 tours (as \\"How the West Was Won\\" can attest from 1972 and any other recordings you can find from 71 to 72). This was Led Zeppelin at their instrumental best. Their reputation was larger, their audiences were larger, as was their catalog of styles and songs to choose from (Now touring behind the fourth biggest selling album of all time!!- Zeppelin IV). At this time they had honed their stage presence, their cohesiveness and their individual musical prowess to a point that would never be equaled again in their career. Plants voice reached its peak in this era. He would never sing with as much range, control, power or clarity again and along with Pages peak of sheer virtuosity, speed, fluidity, and confidence of playing they had no equals in the rock world instrumentally during this era. Jones and Bonham never failed as one of the very best rhythm sections in rock throughout the Zeppelin Career. Jones and Bonham were always able to match what was coming from the front men, to play up or play down to whatever was coming from Page and Plant. Zeppelin were four pistons in perfect harmony by 71 - 72 and performances from this era can only be described as ferocious, devastating and mind blowing to audiences around the world. Zeppelin's legend, popularity and live reputation had been solidified here.       (1973) The 1973 tour can only be defined as Superstardom. This tour was huge, electric and the band was revered as nothing short of gods at this time. This was Led Zeppelin riding their reputation of being the most successful rock band in the world in record sales, their recording catalog (now incorporating the great \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), and from their legend as a live act that they had developed through countless tours up to 1972. The 1973 world tour broke box office attendance records and would be the pinnacle of Zeppelin live as far as their stage persona, rock star status/mystique, catalog of albums/songs to choose from, their realization of their live song structures, the size of venues and audiences, and their ability to still be able to capture the tail end of their absolute instrumental power and peak and play at the top of their game. This was Zeppelin at their most electric -The world's biggest rock stars, flying around in their own private jumbo jet to the world's biggest sellout shows and venues. Plants voice had changed by this tour and did not quite have the power, range or clarity of 1972, JimmyPage at this time was considered the greatest guitarist in the world and the pressure also began to show on him at times during this tour. Though the instrumental machinery had slowed down a bit, the prowess and power was still there for much of this tour. They were still at the top of their instrumental game more times than not and the band also wielded a bigger legacy, legend, mystique and catalog of albums/songs to choose from. The band had also refined the set list and the structure of live versions of songs to their most realized and refined at this stage of their live career. Also, Zeppelin's further developed rock star stage presence/energy of 73 combined with the energy of the 73 audiences was never at a higher level. This magic chemistry mixed with all the reasons given above gives you some of the most satisfying and quintessential Zeppelin performances of all time. When people think of Zeppelin live in the prime of their career, the 1973 version of Zeppelin is what most people envision. Now to my point about the Song Remains the Same.     I have heard many performances from the 1973 tour and there may be shows with more energy or have certain versions of songs that are unsurpassed yet there are truly very few moments from any other 73 Zeppelin shows that rival many of the songs captured at the end of this tour at Madison Square Garden for the \\"Song Remains the Same\\". For instance: Rock and Roll, Celebration Day (the old CD/album version), The Song Remains the Same, The Rain Song, No Quarter (the old version), Dazed and Confused, Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love (the old CD/album version). These are hands down some of the best realized and performed versions of these songs captured live anywhere and from any time-period!       (1975) Led Zeppelin didn't tour again until 1975 (it had been two years!). The Led Zeppelin 1975 tour was a tour of great imagery, mystery and anticipation for audiences that had built Zeppelin up into something beyond legendor even as gods. However, this popularity, the resultant pressure and drug use over the years (mostly by Jimmy and Drinking by Bonzo), and the long lay off from touring had taken its toll on the greatest live band of all time. As Composers and song writers their legacy was still only growing due to their incredible double album released this same year (touring on Physical Graffiti - arguably their greatest album ever), and their imagery from this tour is at times unequalled due to the famous \\"black dragon suite\\" warn by Page, the even longer hair worn by Plant and Page, and the larger stage shows (the first time use of lasers even-a new effect for the time) during this tour etc. However, the band was older, slower and had lost some of its instrumental prowess and pure power machinery that they once had. Plants voice was far removed from the quality it once had only 2 years prior. Page was now battling with a heroin addiction that took its toll from show to show on his guitar playing that only two years prior seemed to be unstoppable and was unequaled from 71-73. This tour was marked by some magic shows that were unfortunately the exception and not the rule at some of their favorite haunts such as Long Beach, The LA Forum, MSG and moments at the end of the tour during their stand at Earls Court in England. Although many magic moments were captured, the shows were instrumentally slower, less technically proficient, and lacked the energy and power that Zeppelin once controlled. Things would never be the same for Led Zeppelin ever again.       (1977) Led Zeppelin toured America for the last time in 1977. Zeppelin hadn't toured since 75 and the lay off again showed more times than not. There were again some magical shows and moments, most notably at certain stands at the bands favorite stomping grounds such as: The LA Forum, Long Beach and Madison Square Garden once again. Their reputation and audiences were larger than life itself at this time. Tragically however, JimmyPage was battling some serious drug addictions, most notably his heroin addiction. Pages playing could go from close to his hey day of 71-73 to absolutely embarrassing from night to night. There were shows when you wondered if page could even hold up his guitar, much less play it. Plants voice was at times actually better than in the 1975 tour yet the performances as a whole could be shaky with a few high lighted exceptional shows along the way. The band was blowing audiences away at this time from pure reputation and status. Much like the Beatles making audience members pass out without even playing a note back in the 60s. Listening to performances from the 1977 tour, you have to really search to find a few great shows from this tour that can even compare to the power and virtuosity of Zeppelin between 71 and 73. This tour was also cut short due to the tragic death of Robert Plant's son.       (1979-1980) Zeppelin would not play again until they played two warm up shows in Copenhagen Denmark in 1979 in preparation for their two huge festival shows at Knebworth in 79 and then the final European shows in 1980 before Bonham's death. Continued Drug addiction and lay offs only further steered the once mighty Zep downward. Although the band gave it their best effort and put up some very admirable fights (shows), none of these shows can truly compare to the power and devastation these four highly tuned pistons could pump out back in 73 and prior to 70/71.     This brings us back to why these Madison Square Garden shows at the peak of the overall greatest band in the world's career and possibly some of the peaks of the 73 tour itself are so, so priceless and underappreciated. Don't listen to the naysayers (remember, look for their large floppy red shoes) and now go and listen to these treasured performances from the hands down greatest Rock Band of all time with fresh ears, a new perspective and with complete reverence my friends! Maybe in the future we can only hope fora complete best of performance from the entire stand at Madison Square Garden 73 in a full, uncut 3 CD set. Until that time however, we should all appreciate that Zeppelin is at least finally trying to put some of their priceless, timeless material, that has been locked away and hidden in their vaults for all these many years, out to the public over the past few years.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|QT got too wrapped up in his own ego for this trip.  The first talk almost worked (but not quite).  When the second ladies chat begins, the movie just dies.  It goes flat and what follows does not save the picture. It even became silly and that did not save it either.  Do not waste the money.
0792839730|4.0|Think of this as 'The Longest Day, Part 2', and you'll have an idea what to expect: glimpses of personal war stories amid glimpses of a major WWII military campaign, with a multi-star cast. But in order to focus on some very compelling personal stories, some of the 'big picture' had to be glossed over to keep the movie's length down. Some people might prefer less 'personal' and/or more 'historical' coverage; this might have made a better mini-series...    PROS: Some stellar performances, accurate equipment, a frank portrayal of war politics, a sympathetic treatment of the Germans, and an attractive price. DVD quality is good.    CONS: Some rather wooden performances, some confusion about  what is happening where in relation to other groups (especially if one is not familiar with this lesser-known campaign), and a feeling at the end that perhaps something was missing (like a sequel?).    While there is something to like here for almost anyone (except love-interest), this movie will appeal mainly to military fans, but with more food for thought than a simple shoot-and-blow-them-up actioner.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is True American music not the garbage they play today on the radio.The Eagles sound as good today as they did when they first started, there music not only carries a message its pure,Simple and spiritual,they are truly amazing and spectacular.Reviewers who give the Eagles a 2 star on this album do not Appreciate true Quality music and I beleive it is an unfair Judgement!!Go Buy this music
B000N3STBQ|2.0|What an incredible album, recorded and mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, where Bowie's Heroes was recorded.  Oh, wait.  This version was mixed recently, using pro-tools, without the wonderful ambience of Hansa... without Gareth Jones and Alan Wilder at the helm.  Unfortunately, it shows.  However, the extras are worth getting, and I dare say it's worth buying just for an A/B comparison with the original issue just to show how real acoustics beat out convoluted (their word, not mine) reverb algorithms EVERY TIME.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Having grown up on the \\"300 Spartans\\", and being old enough not to understand the graphic novel craze. This movie suprized me no end. Expecting just a slash and kill gorefest, I was drawn into a well done and fast moving tale of bravery, and fidelity.  Myself and two friends went to see this film, and  we 40 something year olds were surrounded by 18-20 something year old women enjoying it as much as we, so girls don't be put off by what you may think a sword and sandel slasher. This is an action movie you and him can both enjoy.
B000VI70WM|2.0|DD cant face the fact that they are ageing, and just for the sake of entering the charts (which no one cares about anymore with all the junk pop out there anyway) bring in the musical genius called Justin to create this lame album. I mean who is he to tell DD what their album should sound like? They we out making music when he was in his crib. Its sad to see Roger playing fake drums over a programmed drum machine. What happened to the rockin/drummin DD that made beautiful music? They sold out, thats what happened.
184195425X|5.0|This is a brilliant book. Good points:<br /><br />1. The author uses words very deftly. I don't think I've read metaphors/ similes of this quality since \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\"<br /><br />2. Reading the book was very easy and light, and this is something that could be finished in a single day. It is miraculous that an author can take such a limited setting and find ways to keep it interesting.<br /><br />3. Lots of interesting factoids about animals. If these same facts were presented in a textbook, they would be very dull. When presented in the context of a story like this one, they were very informative and not at all overwhelming in number.<br /><br />4. Though this story was in the vein of another bestselling book \\"Hatchet\\" (Gary Paulsen), the writing was a bit more gritty/ graphic. The author has the ability to make the reader feel as if he was actually *with* the protagonist.<br /><br />There is only one single bad point, and that is: The words describing the boat were quite technical and it was not easy to visualize a situation described by many unfamiliar words. A few sketches might have been nice to help the reader get an idea of the nuts and bolts of the situation.<br /><br />It might also have been nice to have a few parenthetical phrases describing the meaning of a lot words related to Hinduism that peppered the book.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a great love story.  I highly recommend it.  Watch it with someone you truly care about.  Or wtch to remember the one you lost...
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is my favorite album of 2007 with a close second going to Avenged Sevenfold's new album.  This album's lyrics are a little dark/depressed, but the songs are fantastic...
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Wow ,Not only does this prove Led Zeppelin to still be the #1 best band ever ,but there so far ahead of who ever is #2 . The Sound is crystal clear . The peformance is great . Thank god for Led Zeppelin .
B000SM7QUC|4.0|This is so fresh and bold.  Nikki Sixx can out write anyone on any day and I have to say that he did it again.  This is not Motley Crue so don't think your getting Shout or Dr. Feelgood.  If you did not know this was a soundtrack you wouldn't mind either way.  Great music.  Its heavy, melodic and the guitarist and the singer are really powerful as well.    Nice job.
B000002JS6|3.0|Back In Black was the AC/DC album to really put them on the music scene.  After this albums release, the band was never the same.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't entirely thrilled with the quality of the music on the disc.  Songs like \\"Hells Bells\\", the title song, \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and a couple others were, without a doubt, solid classics that deserve all the exposure they've had over the years.  But then you have some questionable filler tracks such as \\"Have a Drink On Me\\", the ever tediously dull \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", and the moronic \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\".  These tunes prevent the album from ever becoming one of the all-time hard rock classics, but for the songs that ARE good, the album is worth purchasing.  A perfect release?  No way.  But it features some good songs.  I highly recommend picking up some of the bands other albums, specifically ones with a harder and muddier edge (like Powerage, High Voltage, and Let There Be Rock).  You can't go wrong with any of AC/DC's 70's albums.
B00002Z83J|5.0|If you like rock guitar....if you like blues guitar then why isn't this in your collection.  You'll freak outwhen you hear it.
B00004XONN|2.0|Kid A is a very overrated album.  The songwriting talents of the band have obviously taken a step back compared to OK Computer, which was the bands absolute high point (even to this day).  \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" is just a very lackluster effort in terms of vocal melody and it becomes annoying after a few listens.  \\"The National Anthem\\" is boring as well, because the first couple minutes are dominated with one grunge-y riff repeating over and over until some over-emotional vocals eventually come in and change all that.  It tries to be something special, but really it's just a pointless experiment.  For some reason, the vocal melody reminds me of the Beatles song \\"It's All Too Much\\".  In fact, a good majority of the songs on the album are just silly or pointless experiments, with not much emotional substance to be found.       Radiohead is clearly much better when writing emotional vocal melodies and interesting lyrical content, which this album greatly suffers.  \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" is probably the biggest attempt at heartfelt emotions, but the devastating atmosphere of the lyrics aren't really as honest as the lead singer would want you to believe.  It's just not enough to save a really average and surprisingly bland album overall.
B00003CXBH|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out, then again when the DVD first came out, then again last year.  The first time I saw it I loved this movie as I did the second time.  The third time I was wishing it could be edited abit more.  Some scenes seemed endless.  I watched it with my brother a few yrs ago and about came to blows over it.  He made some very anti-Catholic remarks that hit me the wrong way.  So I guess those with other eyes will each reach a different conclusion.  We will be watching it soon with a friend who is an indigenous person from Bolivia.  I will be very interested to see his reaction.  I also watched the movie with someone from India.  They knew nothing of this history.    The story is touching and to me asks the question \\"Is pacifism or violence the answer to evil\\"?  And it doesn't give you the answer.  The scenery is truly breathtaking.      I would recommend the movie but you probably need to be in the right mood to watch.     I really enjoyed watching the extra disc with how they made the movie.  Found it as interesting as the movie.
B000WSL5Y0|5.0|A pair of private investigators (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) agrees to join the search for a missing child, unaware of the tangle of hidden motives and ethical dilemmas they will encounter.  Ben Affleck's directorial debut is a grand-slam home run, a taut police procedural with plenty of surprises and revelations that don't feel forced.  The poor Boston neighborhood in which the abduction takes place is filmed with a palpable sense of atmosphere, and the moral choices made by some of the characters leave you with plenty to think about after the end credits roll.  A magnificent supporting cast featuring Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, and a wrenchingly authentic performance by Amy Ryan adds to the production's high quality.

B000002KE2|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Sabbath's fourth studio album is a masterpiece. It peaked  at #13 on the charts, very respectable for a metal band without a single released from it. There's a subtle change in direction on this album. They changed producers with this album &, for the first time, the band received production credit on an album.     The album opens with \\"Wheels of Confusion/The straightener\\", Iommi's riffing is among his best. Tomorrow's Dream\\" is an outstanding song & among the best they ever recorded. It's a short song by Sabbath standards. Then comes the ballad \\"Changes\\" which is the weakest song on the album. A lot of people like this song but it's one I can do without. Then comes the instrumental \\"FX\\", not really a song, just some noodling by Iommi, it's interesting but nothing special. It's under two minutes long so it doesn't have time to get on your nerves. The next two songs are the highlights of the album, both almost unanimous favorites of Sabbath fans. \\"Supernaut\\" is a sci-fi tales that abounds with guitars & leads, it's got a killer beat & pretty darn vocals by the Ozzman. \\"Snowblind\\" follows, it's more moody & has a definite drug reference. Lyrically, it's full of imagery & one of their best. Iommi has once again put together a very distinctive riff. \\"Cornucopia\\" is the last excellent song on the album. \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" (instrumental), \\"St. Vitus Dance\\" & \\"Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\\" close out the album. They're decent enough songs but not particularly impressive.    This was an excellent effort, some might consider this their last great effort. Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath (Their next album) wasn't quite as good but Sabotage, an underrated album, certainly comes close to equaling this effort.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore may not look like your classic genius, but he is.  His ability to combine fact, humor, and good old American common sense, and make it fun and entertaining, is remarkable and gifted.<br /><br />I'll admit I had reservations myself about the cost/benefit of universal health care, and the critical innuendoes thereof abundant in our culture. Micheal Moore empathizes with such reservation, but shows us how pathetically brainwashed we are, with both his documented facts, and intuitive displays of peoples' satisfaction living with such systems. He shows the  obvious (but not snotty) amusement of Canadians, French and Brits (and Cubans too) with the typical American disbelief and skepticism - at the same time expressing their empathy for our travails and respect for Americans as basically good people. They only want to help.<br /><br />This is hard for the right wing and the for-profit disease-care industry to counterpoint.  Facts can always be disputed, and statistics can always be scrutinized, but the interviews with these people in other countries tells a better story than all the fact and figures you can find, and in a very entertaining way.<br /><br />We've gotten so used to living this way, we've forgotten how it used to be, and how it should be.<br /><br />We ride with the French physician driving around all night making house calls.

B000002KHH|3.0|Apparently I'm in the vast minority when it comes to this album. Of their first six albums I consider this to be their fourth best effort (quit throwing those rotten apples at me, will ya?), surpassing Technical Ecstasy & easily outdistancing Never Say Die! Sabbath's second studio album went to #12 on the album charts. The album was fueled by two singles, \\"Iron Man\\" which peaked at #52 & \\"Paranoid\\" which went to #61. It's amazing that these songs managed to chart at all since fans of this kind of music normally didn't purchase 45's.    The album opens with \\"War Pigs\\" which starts slowly but gets going after a couple of minutes, riff-master, Tony Iommi, treats us to a good one. Then comes \\"Paranoid\\", one of their most concise songs; it's one you can actually get up & dance to, not something you usually can do with heavy metal. Iommi double tracks his lead which is normal for him. Then comes the slow phase-laden vocal of \\"Planet Caravan\\" which is one of their best slow songs. It definitely has the feel of taking us on  a space journey. Iommi's clean lead is a pleasant change of pace. Riff-master Iommi treats us to one of his most memorable in the classic \\"Iron Man\\". This song is the very definition of heavy metal. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is the weakest song on the album. The best part of the song is the middle when Sabbath kicks it up a notch. \\"Hand of Doom\\" gets the album back on track, even Ozzy gives a better vocal performance than what he's normally given credit for. About two minutes into the song they change tempos that gets the song into whole different groove. The instrumental \\"Rat Salad\\" is another song that pales in comparison to other songs on the album though Iommi does entertain us with some good riffs. Bill Ward does his first recorded drum solo, great drumming, I like it that they kept it short & to the point. The final song, \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" is one of their best songs. The multiple movements & Iommi's leads make this an outstanding song. It's off-kiltermusical feel fits perfectly with  the lyrics & Ozzy's vocals.    This is a good album though with three of their best songs, \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\" & \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\". \\"Planet Caravan\\" is also one of their best slow songs. But for some reason I don't listen to this album very often. I would rather listen to Black Sabbath, Master of Reality, Vol. 4 & Sabotage.    \\"Smokin' & trippin' is all you do...\\"
B000HWXS2S|5.0|[[VIDEOID:16237811]]Oden is a superb album, much like the rest of Amon Amarth's work. The one thing that makes this album stand apart is imply the production value has increased. The tracks sound clearer and crisper and the editing is superb.<br /><br />I advise anyone whom has heard and liked any older Amon Amarth albums to pick this up immediately. Fans of Death, Viking, Power, Thrash and even Black Metal styles can enjoy this. Don't get me wrong nothing on this album signifies Amon Amarth as the most talented band around but I can safely say they are and possible will always be one of the most faithful to their style.<br /><br />Releasing solid album one after the next its no wonder they have garnered so much fame and they deserve every ounce as they have yet to use that new found power to sell out. They continue to stick true to their roots and I am one to commend them for that so for the love of metal go buy this album! Support a band that supports your scene!<br /><br />Included is the music video for the single 'Cry of the Black Birds' off of Amon Amarth's hit Viking/Death Metal album With Oden on our Side. Enjoy!
B000SZLSB2|3.0|James Blunt's voice and lyrics absolutely captivated me on album one.  His first album was something different than the usual sugar-coated pop; a unique spirit drifted through the music and lyrics of the first album that only comes along once in a great while.  Where the second album would go was a mystery and a cause of some anxiety: could this spirit be sustained?  For me, although there were some powerful songs on the second album, much of what is unique and powerful in James Blunt (again,\\"for me\\") was overpowered by a loud jangly clanging background.  The beauty of Blunt lies in the fragile beauty of his voice; the clangy-jangliness of the pop band at his back diminished that beauty.  The album sounded over-produced.  I can't help wondering what the music sounded like drifting out over the Spanish countryside as it was composed.  I'd love to hear James Blunt unplugged next time around.  In the meantime, I'll listen more to the first than to the second album - and put him together on my ipod with songs from the 'My Life' album by Iris Dement -  Happy sonic trails.
B000XPU5NY|3.0|First off, before I get labeled a hater for daring to write a critical review of this set, let me make it clear that I have been a big Genesis fan for a number of decades now.  I was very interested when I heard that the band got back together, if a little dubious at the prospect they were just touring their old stuff, with no new tunes.  Still, live Genesis is about as good as it gets, so my hopes were high.    However, when playing this set, I was a bit disheartened when, after a rousing rendition of Duke's Intro, the band then launched into a version of Turn it on Again that sounded like it was coming from a record that was playing too slowly.  The pitch was decidedly lower than what I was used to, and consequently the song was much less spirited than past recorded performances.  I forwarded to No Son of Mine - same thing.  Wondering if I was remembering correctly, I broke out my old Genesis CDs and compared: sure enough - out of the twenty-one songs on this set, no fewer than twelve have been transposed to a lower key.  I can only presume this is because Phil Collins can no longer hit the high notes the way he used to, and the songs were lowered to save strain on his voice.  I can certainly sympathize; these guys aren't spring chickens any more, and time does take a toll, especially given the way Collins used to sing.  Still, there is a sense of loss in it.  More importantly, the key in which music is written has everything to do with the mood of the piece.  Changing the key changes the impact of the music.  In many instances, these songs simply do not hit with the kind of intensity or vigor that they should.  Moreover, their arrangements are about as predictable as a plot in a James Bond movie; they play these songs the same way (not counting the key changes) they've always played them in concert.  Considering how many live Genesis albums are already out there, it begs the question, why do we need another set, especially one where they have to alter their performances to account for technical shortcomings in the band members? On the whole, I got the sad feeling I was listening to a once-great act that is now just going through the motions.      On the plus side, the band is as tight as it has always been, and this is without question the best recorded live Genesis set I have heard.  It also presents the greatest range of material we've yet had on a Genesis live album, although material from Abacab is notably lacking.  For people who don't mind the key changes, or just love the band no matter what, these qualities will be sufficient to make the purchase worthwhile.  However, when I think of their great live records of the past, or the excellence of their studio albums, I have to concede, reluctantly, that this set just does not meet the same standard.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I spent an enjoyable couple of hours watching this movie with my son. The hero is Remy, a rat who just doesn't fit in. He is a true gourmand. He wants to be a chef, but his family tells him that he is just a rat, and he can't have a dream like that. He befriends a lowly busboy in the kitchen of a Paris restaurant, a young man who has no talent for cooking until he teams up with our hero. The premise is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter. The characters are loveable, the scenery amazing, the sly jokes amusing, and in the end I found myself cheering for the good guys. The story includes an affecting love story, some internecine kitchen rivalries, and an evil plot to sell out the restaurant's good name.<br /><br />The only celebrity voice in the movie, Peter O'Toole, plays a wonderfully wicked food critic. Amazon's review calls this character \\"the film's sole sour note - an oddly pointed slap at critics.\\" What is wrong with these amazon reviewers? This was not sour, but completely apropos. Most critics deserve an occasional slap, myself included.<br /><br />My teenage son allowed that this movie was \\"all right.\\" He laughed at the jokes, and I saw him completely captivated for the duration. I certainly forgot about everything else for a while. I hope that you will too.
B000000YBQ|5.0|I own at least 20 Bill Evans recording but this is his best. Why?    1- His trio with Paul LaFaro was totally matured. Since LaFaro would die only a few days later, it is the zenith of Evans' work with LaFaro. LaFaro gave Evans an opportunity that no other sideman ever did. He was so creative in the way that he played bass that Evans and he played duets, with the gentle but essential drumming of Paul Motian underscoring everything that was happening. Nothing that Evans ever did approached his trio with LaFaro.    2- Like most jazz musicians, Evans was best in front of an appreciative live audience.    3- There were two albums recorded during Evans' stay at the Vanguard. The other album, \\"Live at the Village Vanguard\\" featured cuts where LaFaro was dominant, as he had just died. \\"Waltz for Debbie\\" is more typical of what the trio usually played, and the tunes favored the ballads and waltzes that Evans played best.    There is nothing but great tracks on this album, but in my opinion, Evans' recording of the title track is the best thing that he ever recorded.    Evans is my all time favorite jazz pianist, and this is his best album. Six stars!
0143038583|4.0|Reading Pollan's look at food chains in the U.S. has to make people think about what it is they eat and whether we make the right choices.  What are we willing to sacrifice in order to eat what may be better for us?  What is better or worse about the foods available?  Are shelf life and convenience worth losing taste and healthfulness?  Are they even mutually exclusive?    We are a nation of fat people getting fatter -- at least the statistics say so.  There can only be two causes for this phenomenon:  diet and exercise.  If Pollan has done nothing else, he has given us reasons to look at what we eat, study it instead of believing the words in the advertisements or packages, and try to make more intelligent decisions about foods.  That can't be all bad.  The one drawback is the fact, pure and simple, that Pollan isn't a scientist or agriculture expert.  He makes no pretense in that direction.  He is a journalist who documented his own experiences as he looked at what is available to us, how it comes to us, and what we can do with the great variety of products once we've purchased them.  The greatest service of this book is to encourage us to look at these things and try to make more intelligent decisions.  He offers no solutions to perceived problems; he only gives us an idea of what is out there.  It's up to us to find the solutions that will work for us.    The book itself, although well written for the most part, has moments of confusion when he jumps back and forth in time.  One would have to draw out a timeline in order to get a sense of the order in which his adventures took place.  Another is some repetitiveness, as has been noted by other reviewers.  A good amount of careful editing would have benefited the narrative.  It is a book worth a read for anyone who doesn't mind knowing where problems may lie in what we eat.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|My friend and I spent much of the month leading into the 'Minutes To Midnight' release debating whether it'd be a smart decision for Linkin Park to drop the nu metal and go in another direction. While both somewhat disappointed in the sudden change of style, you had to be encouraged by the fact that the band was actually brave enough to get away from what made them so popular. Now, I must admit, this did not by any means sit well with me in the beginning when I first heard the album. I completely understand why 'Minutes To Midnight' got bad reviews and why Linkin Park has been tabbed as one of the more disappointing bands of the year thus far. However, I'm the type of fan that tries not to compare albums, but judge based solely on what's at hand. So after several listens and fighting the feeling of a major letdown, I'm ready to review this album.<br /><br />First of all, I understand the band wrote over 150 songs and emerged with these 12. I find it hard to believe that a song like \\"In Between\\" beat out 138+ demos to make it onto this disc. If ever there was a filler, that song fits the bill. I make a point of this first because it's the first and only Linkin Park to date song I strongly dislike.<br />As for the rest of the album-- \\"Wake\\" is an instrumental piece comparable to Mr. Hahn's work with \\"Session\\" and \\"Cure For The Itch\\". However, it's a fantastic beginning to the album, and \\"Given Up\\" gives it a kick as the first full-length track.<br /><br />\\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" is supposed to be a single. Yes, it's a light anthem for every teenage girl who just likes the idea of being a Linkin Park fan. But for the sake of being impartial, I really like the verses. The chorus leaves a little to be desired, but it's still a very listenable song. \\"Bleed It Out\\", the fourth track, on the other hand, is flooding the radios. It's a warm welcome back to the rap/rock Linkin Park we've come to know and love. Shinoda brings some of the best lyrics the band has showcased and Chester's screaming is enough to burn your insides.<br />It's no surprise I think \\"Shadow Of The Day\\" sounds like \\"With Or Without You\\" by U2, since most fans' critiques are based on the fact that they think Linkin Park is trying to be the next generation U2. This, in particular, is not one of my favorite tracks, but it has still generated some popularity, not to mention radio play.<br />\\"What I've Done\\", of course, is the lead single. There are very few who will argue with the brilliance of that song.<br />\\"Hands Held High\\" is a lyrically sound song that, for the first time in the band's history, features every member of the group singing simultaneously. I could not get myself into this song until just recently, but I think it has good pace and a beat that sticks to you. It truly isn't the Linkin Park we've grown to know so well, but it's a side of them I find that expands their horizons and explores new heights. They performed it, along with the next song, \\"No More Sorrow\\", on Projekt Revolution, and I was hooked. \\"No More Sorrow\\" is an anti-Bush track that has guitar riffs reminiscent of Metallica. It's one of my personal favorites, not just on this album but in the entire Linkin Park repertoire.<br />\\"Valentine's Day\\" is unanimously recognized as a weak track, and while it's not one of my personal favorites, I give it props for building its pace into the last 45 seconds or so. It's not the track to lead with your best foot on, but it's an 8 1/2 of 10. On the other end of the spectrum, there's \\"In Between\\".<br />Moving forward, \\"In Pieces\\", in my opinion, is the dark horse of the album. I can't even find the right words to describe it. It's just a brave song from Linkin Park and it works on every level.<br /><br />\\"The Little Things Give You Away\\"-- Well, this was mentioned as an epic song by the band, and to this point it hasn't panned out the way they've wanted it to. However, I wouldn't be surprised if it builds momentum in the coming years. This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated songs Linkin Park has ever written. The melody is phenomenal, the lyrics are exceptional, the guitar solo in the bridge is one for the ages, and the combination of Mike's singing and Chester's vocals in the final minute and a half of the song is an emotionally sound ending to the album.<br /><br />All in all, these are my song ratings:<br />Wake: 9/10<br />Given Up: 9/10<br />Leave Out All The Rest: 7.5/10<br />Bleed It Out: 9.5/10<br />Shadow Of The Day: 8/10<br />What I've Done: 10/10<br />Hands Held High: 9/10<br />No More Sorrow: 9.5/10<br />Valentine's Day: 8.5/10<br />In Between: 4/10<br />In Pieces: 10/10<br />The Little Things Give You Away: 10/10<br /><br />My best advice would be to just listen to the album for what it is. It's easy, almost inevitable to make comparisons, but to complain that Linkin Park has changed too much isn't going to revive their nu metal era. Bands evolve; it's a simple, sometimes painful fact. This isn't my favorite Linkin Park album by any means, but it's still a very good effort and worth the purchase.<br /><br />Minutes To Midnight: B+/A-rk has ever written. The melody is phenomenal, the lyrics are exceptional, the guitar solo in the bridge is one for the ages, and the combination of Mike's singing and Chester's vocals in the final minute and a half of the song is an emotionally sound ending to the album.    All in all, these are my song ratings:  Wake: 9/10  Given Up: 9/10  Leave Out All The Rest: 7.5/10  Bleed It Out: 9.5/10  Shadow Of The Day: 8/10  What I've Done: 10/10  Hands Held High: 9/10  No More Sorrow: 9.5/10  Valentine's Day: 8.5/10  In Between: 4/10  In Pieces: 10/10  The Little Things Give You Away: 10/10    My best advice would be to just listen to the album for what it is.

B000RZIGVS|4.0|First off I'm giving this 4 stars out of 5 not because the series is bad but because Paramount rushed this set out knowing the TOS HD-DVD set was hot on its heels. Everyone wants to make money and I'm no exception but, I wouldn't have put out this set knowing that I'm going to remaster the series for HD-DVD in the near future. That being said ... It's great to see TNG coming out as a Complete Series set and in much more compact packaging than the original DVD releases. However I am going to wait until they finish up the TOS HiDef release [[ASIN:B000VDDDY6 Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD]]] and the eventual Rerelease of all the ST Series (TNG, DS9, VOY & Enterprise) in High Def. You know it's coming...and I have the series on DVD already so I can still watch any episode at any time I want so I think I can wait for the next upgrade in picture/sound quality. I'm real interested to see Enterprise on Blu-Ray because it was shot in HD and in Widescreen (I wish DS9 had been shot like that but, hindsight and all that).    Bottom line: If you don't have the series and want to watch the episodes... rent them from netflix or from Amazon Unbox.    If you already bought the individual DVDs or Full Season Sets then wait for the eventual Blu-Ray version... I have a feeling it will be worth the wait and you'll save $$$ in the long run.    Now go out there and watch some trek!
0374105235|4.0|Three things comprise a strong memoir: Story, storytelling, and context.  A Long Way Gone warrants respect on two of the three counts.  The story, full of visceral imagery and intelligent reflection, maintains impact well beyond the read itself.  The storytelling ability of the author shows, though more-so in the latter half of the book (more focus on pacing could have helped).  Context, however, is lacking.<br /><br />For a memoir to resonate beyond itself as strongly as possible the reader has to feel as though the story fits within his or her own world, or at least the reader must understand the full scope of the world in which the story takes place.  In the case of A Long Way Gone, because the author was so entrenched in his subject matter since literally the beginning of his cognitive memory, he is lost to much of the daily life before the war.  These times are touched upon, but perhaps historical information (beyond the appended chronological time line) would have helped cement the story.<br /><br />This is a minor gripe, however, as unlike many memoirs the author does not seem concerned with public image and career potential.  His stories are told in such a way that the reader rarely feels compelled to search for potential fictions (a common practice in our \\"reality TV-everyone is a star-James Frey culture).
0316067598|3.0|I am an unabashed admirer of Marcus Luttrell's service, his love of country, his physical prowess, his tactical expertise and his incredible story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his coauthor, Patrick Robinson, was lazy and did very little fact checking.  As a former military aviator, I am familiar with many of the aviation aspects of the story.  I noted many basic mistakes (a C-130 is not a Boeing, nor are its engines, neither is a C-141, etc.), which made me wonder what else in the book--among those aspects with which I had little familiarity--was wrong.  As much as I didn't want to, I started to question the story's credibility.<br /><br />Too, Robinson's British heritage appears in the Texan's narrative, and it's awkward:  We don't \\"hire\\" cars in the States--and certainly not in Texas.  We rent them.  A \\"touchline\\" is a British sporting term, not American.  Small things such as this detract from the book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Luttrell's story is absolutely remarkable.  As irritating as Robinson's treatment is, the book is a good read.  It's simply a shame that this remarkable man's coauthor and publisher let the book get onto shelves with less than perfect writing.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|The dammed souls come out in the fog, and anyting else that maybe lurking around.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is the first new album I've bought in ... well longer than I can remember. As a 27 year fan of the Eagles this album has been a long wait and I must say I'm very happy they finally did it. There have been a few tracks that have appeared since their \\"reunion\\" a few years ago but this is the first full on album since The Long Run. Some will argue that it may have been better to shorten it down to one album instead of two. However if they had done that there would of been those of us that would be complaining about missing out on the tracks they left off. My own personally assessment after listening to the albums non stop for about a week is that they pretty much nailed it. Sure there are a couple of tracks that maybe don't light my fire as much as others but overall it's a great pair of discs.    Disc 1  No More Walks In The Woods - Pretty much continues where Seven Bridges Road left off. An almost a capella (there is a little acoustic guitar) track that really showcases the great harmonies the Eagles are famous for. I do feel it would of been better to start the set with a more uptempo song but that's not much of a criticism. The album cover lists the song as 4 minutes but it's actually only 2 minutes.    How Long - Probably the best track on the album. The fact that it was written by J.D Souther in 1972 is probably why it sounds like it could of come off any of their first three albums. A little reminiscent of Take It Easy. I really wish they had done more tracks like this. Maybe if the feedback on this track gets back to them the next album will have a lot more of this kind of stuff.    Busy Being Fabulous - Kind of reminds me of the title track from The Long Run in it's feel if not the lyrics.     What Do I Do With My Heart - Slow paced track from Glenn Frey. While not exactly the most thrilling track it does have some nice harmonies and some good guitar work.    Guilty Of the Crime - First of two Joe Walsh lead vocal tracks. I seem to enjoy the Joe Walsh tracks more than most of the songs on this set. Always been a big fan of Joe and these two tracks really showcase his sense of humor and of course the legendary guitar. Nice piano piece in the middle too.    I Don't Want To Hear Any More - Never thought I'd see a Paul Carrack song on an Eagles album. Pleasant enough song and handled very nicely by Timothy B.    Waiting In The Weeds - A 7 minute opus whose opening few bars almost sound like a Bruce Springsteen song. One of the strongest tracks. (1:36 outro)    No More Cloudy Days - One of the better Glenn Frey tracks. One that sounds more like an Eagles track rather than a solo track with the band playing on it. Sounds a little like Nilsson's Everybodys Talkin'    Fast Company - Every time this track comes on I think of Life In The Fast Lane. Both have \\"Fast\\" in the title and both feature Don Henley's falsetto. Similar theme in the lyrics too. Very catchy tune and one the tunes that has grown on me the most.    Do Something - Another vocal from Timothy B. Very country sounding song. Slow paced but enjoyable all the same.    You Are Not Alone - One of the strongest Glenn Frey tracks on the album. A nice closer for disc one. Apart from Glenn's instrumental on disc two this is the shortest track running in at 2:24.    Disc 2    Long Road Out of Eden - I see his as the third in a trilogy. The Last Resort, King Of Hollywood and now Long Road Out Of Eden. The haunting Arabic sounding intro fits the song nicely. Probably go down as one of Don Henley's strongest tracks ever. Great guitar work throughout the song.    I Dreamed There Was No War - Nice short and sweet instrumental track from Glenn Frey.    Somebody - One of the few really strong uptempo numbers on the set. Unfortunately unlike How Long this sounds more like a Glenn Frey solo track. Nice pumping bass.    Frail Grasp On The Big Picture - Followed suitably by a track that sounds like a Don Henley solo track. Dirty Laundry II perhaps.    Last Good Time In Town - Joe Walsh provides us with a Steely Dan sounding ditty. I wonder if Joe wrote this as a poke in the eye to The Dan given the history of the two bands. Great track in my opinion. Joe's vocals still sound great.    I Love To Watch A Woman Dance - Probably the weakest track on the album. Written by Larry John McNally (who wrote For My Wedding on Don Henley's Inside Job album). Kind of folksy slow ballad. Nice but a little boring.    Business As Usual - Nice intro. A pretty good song from Don but sounds more like a solo track than classic Eagles. Still nothing to complain about here.    Center Of The Universe - Another Don Henley track. One of the top 5 tracks on the album. Nice acoustic guitar and close harmonies. Don's best vocal on the album.    It's Your World Now - Glenn Frey cajoled a mariachi band to back him on this one it sounds like. I can see why some would not like this, it doesn't sound like the Eagles at all but I like it.    overall a great 2 album set. Well worth the wait. An album I will be playing a lot over the next few months. And at $11.99 for a 2 CD set a bargain for so many tracks. How Long will we have to wait for the next one? not long I hope.
140120306X|5.0|As a huge fan of Alan Moore and this series, I just had to pick up The Black Dossier as soon as I saw it. After racing through it as fast as I could, I must say, I was not disappointed. Unlike the first two League books, the Dossier's main story is interlaced with documents from Moore's literary world. Not much happens in the main storyline until the end, but the documents are astounding: Moore shows amazing versatility as he veers from writing in Newspeak, creating a Shakespearian play, and imitating P. G. Wodehouse's unique style. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who has not read the previous League books, but for those who have been following the adventures of Mina Murray and the others, the Black Dossier is a must-have.
0316067598|5.0|could not put this book down...every American should read this book and give thanks to the powers that be and the people who choose to live, bleed, and die for this nation.  your eyes will be opened, your heart will be broken, but you will be a better person for the experience and the gift marcuss lutrell has given us.    thanks to all the marcus' out there, lead the way.
B000FSME1A|4.0|The fact that \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" was not included here does not matter. The documentary is a huge disappointment. If you've heard about what's in the it, there is genuinely no need to see it. It is one of the most over-hyped films I've encountered. It is slightly irritating that it hasn't been included here, but, in the final analysis, it's no real loss.    Releasing the documentary separately, and at a price more expensive than that of \\"The Complete Dossier,\\" tells me that Coppola is desperate to make some quick money. Coppola is relying on the fact that \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" got good initial reviews and and has ever since remained relatively unseen and sought after (which means that most of us will only have second hand knowledge of it) and hence that we will not anticipate how much of a non-event it really is.

B000VWYNNW|4.0|TSRTS remains one of the more perplexing releases in Led Zeppelin's history.  Arguably recorded at the commercial peak but the beginning of Robert Plant's vocal decline - it's nevertheless the strongest, just about, concert the band played in 1973. For all these reasons, and the band's longest set pieces, TSRTS inspires mixed reactions rather than an outright 'wow' that accompanies most Zep albums.<br /><br />This edition of the album is so much better than the original release - more songs, and more complete - and yet, edited again by Mr Page.  Personally, I've never been a fan of the ultra long solos in some songs, and don't miss them all that much.  I agree the Ocean is out of place.  Black Dog's edit doesn't perturb me since Plant's voice is flaccid.  Fans of the originals will find some of the versions here rough and transformed: \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" is skippable simply because Plant can't hit the melody lines and \\"Rock and Roll\\" is improvised but still rollicking.<br /><br />So why get this?  Simple.  Jimmy Page's blazing guitarwork - and the new mix.  TSRTS actually sounds cleaner than the earlier recorded How the West Was Won - and more dimensional.  However, for true classic Zep performances - stick to HTWWW or the BBC Sessions for more faithful renditions.  TSRTS is more for Zep diehards and completists.  It's not the be all and end all of Zep, but it is recommended if you enjoyed tracks from the original version of this release.<br /><br />The Song Remains the Same and Rain Song are enjoyable to listen to.  Also welcome is Since I've Been Loving You, Heartbreaker and No Quarter.<br /><br />The majestic version of Stairway to Heaven here is IMHO the best ever recorded and testimony to Led Zep's greatness.  Regardless of the studio version, this Madison Square Garden performance ranks as the most complete version ever recorded.  Edits or what-not, Plant's vocal genius is captured in the Garden - without peer.  The man gives 200 % of himself.  Put yourself in front row with this one.<br /><br />The mix is different and the vocal takes subtly altered - diehard TSRTS listeners will discern these changes.  They shouldn't bother most people except the hard core fans.  I agree that some of the edits do make a difference to those used to the original...would be nice to know why Page and Shirley decided to make those changes.<br /><br />TSRTS is for all its shortcomings - still a crucial piece of Zep history, and represents the closing of an era in many ways.  Zep would never sound quite the same again as they did in flower power 73.this one.    The mix is different and the vocal takes subtly altered - diehard TSRTS listeners will discern these changes.

B00007AJF8|5.0|For the past decade, films seem to be a rehash of the same old plots. Being John Malkovich is the exception and a very enjoyable one at that. Even knowing the basic plot or ending can't prepare you for the actual film. It's entertaining, creative, original, surprising, and best of all - unpredictable. As incrediable and unrealistic as the plot may seem to be, the acting and direction make the film believable. I found myself easily going along for the ride that comes from taking opportunistic advantage of an accedental discovery.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Long live the Eagles .... Over all I would rate this CD package as middle of the road,  About 50% of the songs are true eagles music and the other 50% sounds like songs that came from solo work, and not as a band.    Plus there's too much pop type music and not classic Eagles work.   The great thing now a days you can create your own CD.   Overall there's a good collection of Awesome Eagles harmony and southern rock.  I would recommend the CD as a buy ....
6305949980|3.0|To review this DVD is a challenge to me. It was an overpriced item to begin with, but I had loved the movie so much in the theatre that I chose a gently used copy to purchase. Here is the part of the review where I remind AMAZON users to check ratings and read reviews of sellers because it was one of the two times in many purchases that I never received the product nor was I refunded any money. Which is my problem with the whole process. Although many dealers are reputable and have a priority of customer service. Some are not and they already have your money. So I gave the 3 star rating only because it was a great movie and I'm imagining that it's out of print because you will be hard pressed to find a decent copy for under thirty dollars.
0618680004|4.0|I've read a couple of books on this topic, and for my money, this one (so far at least) is the most compelling.  Dawkins builds his case against the existence of God logically and incrementally.  Other books on the subject have had a tendency to make random superficial arguments.  Dawkins goes to lengths to address counter-arguments to his points whenever possible.<br /><br />Dawkins is a scientist, and not surprisingly he is in his element when the discussion turns to scientific matters.  He acknowledges that he is neither an historian nor an expert on world religions.  He confines his discussions primarily to Christianity, the religion he is most familiar with.  I did find that, in some cases, he may have delved more deeply into an issue than I felt was necessary, but for the most part, Dawkins stays on point and makes a strong case.<br /><br />In my case, as for most readers I assume, Dawkins is `preaching to the choir'.  The people who should read this book, probably won't.  I didn't really expect to read anything in this book that would shift my thinking, but I did.  I have considered myself an agnostic for some time now, but now realize that I am actually a `de facto atheist'.  I have generally kept my religious convictions (or lack thereof) to myself, and have believed, for the most part, that if religion gives people comfort and a sense of purpose & peace of mind, who am I to question their beliefs.  It isn't fair or reasonable, I thought, to associate mainstream religion with fundamentalism and extremists.  What I have come to realize though, is that mainstream religious culture may actually be enabling those extremists and fundamentalists.<br /><br />The God Delusion may not be as entertaining as some of the other books on the subject, but it is one of the most interesting, well presented and thorough cases I've read.  Well worth reading.
B000UX6THK|5.0|\\"Twin Peaks\\", like \\"Lost\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\", is a beautifully wrought epic film made possible by broadcasting it as a television series. Large sections of it are better made technically than the vast majority of feature films. The hair in the butter with all three is that no ending can be satisfying. Someday an artist will make one of these projects and build a structure with an ending that will seem surprising but entirely right instead of painting themselves into a corner just to keep their own interest. So far a stunning ending is the only thing that has eluded the creators of these three projects. It should be noted that it is very rare for a film director to successfully control color - Hitchcock in \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Vertigo\\", Viscounti in \\"Death in Venice\\" (a little over done actually) - and David Lynch with \\"Twin Peaks\\". The shots of the lumber factory where the machines seem to have a malevolent mind of their own as saws thoughtfully hone other saws (mechanical reproduction?) or turn trees from natural phenomena into slabs of wood are some of the most disturbing shots of the film, particularly in this new brilliant transfer. Lynch is also a brilliant caster of actors and the writing is so sharp and on point that all his actors have to do is act through it, always the secret of performing good material and often abused by American actors, who train on soap opera dialogue. The gimmicks that made the series a relative hit when first released seem more genuine with time. It's a shame Frost and Lynch didn't stay focused on the series in the second year, as it is the masterpiece of their careers. The contempt ABC showed by moving it around and wrecking the audience for it may have been somewhat mirrored in the divided attention of its creators.
061891868X|5.0|I quite like this book. In fact I like it so much I recommended it to a friend of mine who has a Ph.D. in physics, and I decided to buy one for my professor in college (I studied physics as an undergrad). I cannot say I agree with all the author has to say, for example, why is he opposed to the \\"anthropic solution\\" or the \\"landscape of string theories\\" while proposing his own \\"cosmological natural selection\\"? To me, at least philosophically, the \\"anthropic solution\\" could be plausible, even though it is not testable.<br /><br />That said, the most important insights I got from this book is that two main  things led physics astray in recent decades: 1. over-obsession with mathematics and negligence of physical intuition or insights; 2. what the author calls \\"sociology\\". Perhaps the tenure system is the real hindrance to the advancement of science (not just physics).<br /><br />I think this is a very frank book from someone \\"in the know\\" and it offers some fresh perspectives, I think anyone who thinks about pursuing a career in theoretical physics really should read it (as the author says, \\"theoretical physics is hard, really hard\\", if you are not a real genius and have extraordinary perseverance, you probably should do some more practical). For the rest of us, it is a good read nevertheless!
1878424114|5.0|I've always been a fan of Deepak Chopra, and this is one of my favorite books by him.  He brings together spirituality and success (two terms not often associated with each other) in a way that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />I particularly like his quote, \\"I am that, you are that, all this is that, and that's all there is.\\"<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick but powerful read on how to fulfill your dreams in a spiritual way, this is a great book to read!
0465092756|4.0|I very much enjoy the first part of the book, which gives a succinct yet quite comprehensive overview of development in particle physics and the formulation of the \\"standard model\\". It also gives good insights about the relationship between theoretical physics and mathematics and the cross-fertilization between the two fields.<br /><br />The criticism of string theory is, of course, the main theme of this book. And in this I found the author's opinion is probably a little biased. I am not implying, as some other reviewers did, that this is a \\"virulent attack\\" on string theory; on the contrary, I found the arguments very professionally presented. However, I can't help but sense that the author's treatment of string theory is a little uneven-handed. String theory may have gone too far and led \\"mainstream\\" theoretical physics a stray, but at least its early success in unifying theory, etc. cannot be completely overlooked. Also, I think the author did not quite sufficiently explained string theory in depth before criticizing it.<br /><br />That said, it is very enjoyable read and the writing is clear, compact and easy to comprehend (I read it on a flight and could not put it down). One perhaps should read it in tandem with Lee Smolin's \\"The trouble with physics\\".
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I just ordered the Complete Series, but not in the \\"Barbie Box\\". I ordered Seasons 1-7 individually (Seasons 1-6 were only $14.99 each). Based on the reviews I've read on Amazon, I'm not missing out on much and I saved $61.06 (all seven seasons cost me only $128.93). You'd better hurry if you want to order at this price before they sell out!    Update - 11/25/07 - Not sure if Amazon read this review but the price on Seasons 1-6 went up to $23.99 each, so now you will save only $7.06 if you order each season individually vs the Complete Series in a boxed set.    Another Update - 12/18/07 - Wow Amazon - It seems the closer it gets to Christmas, the higher your prices climb. In just over three weeks, the price on the individual seasons has gone from $14.99 to $39.99 each! That's an increase of about 267%. I am thrilled that I got mine when I did, but I feel bad for those that didn't, especially if they are just trying to complete their collection with a season or two. I do love shopping Amazon and they generally have great prices on most items. Just know that when you see an exceptional price, you should order right away because the price will likely increase (possibly within hours).
B000F3T3CS|5.0|I must confess from the start that, although I think this is a five-star production, my favorite L'Elisir on DVD remains the Macerata Opera production from 2002, without a single well-known performer in it (see my review if you're interested). That said, if not as magical as the Macerata production, this one is also stellar.<br /><br />To start with, the production's well-known performers must share star billing with the sets and costumes. They transport us to the provincial village that the characters inhabit. Even Dulcamara makes his entrance in a cart pulled by a real donkey.<br /><br />Adina is the perfect role for Anna Netrebko. It allows her to show her coloratura and acting skills. She's having a great time and it's infectious.<br /><br />Rolando Villazon is often criticized for overacting and, indeed, his flailing about can sometimes be distracting. But here, it perfectly suits Nemorino's comically clumsy pursuit of Adina. Then he puts the comic antics aside and delivers such a nuanced and moving performance of \\"Una furtiva lagrima\\" that the audience insists on an encore.<br /><br />It's a wonderful surprise to see the great Verdi baritone, Leo Nucci, as Belcore. His voice is surprisingly light and flexible and he's clearly relishing playing up the sleazy side of the character.<br /><br />Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (Dulcamara) possesses a beautiful bass baritone voice. (He excels as Leporello on two recent \\"Don Giovanni\\" DVD's.) He also has a strong stage presence. That charisma and his deep resonant voice, make his duets with the two leads both funny and musically superb.<br /><br />L'Elisir d'Amore is an opera treat from beginning to end. This production beautifully shows off the brilliance of Donizetti.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|First off, I'm a huge Stephen King fan (since the 5th grade), and I was excited to see his most popular short story on the big screen. The acting was decent all around, but nothing special. The CGI looked below par at times, but was effective and chilling for the most part. The biggest complaint most people will have is with the ultra depressing ending. It is totally different from the book, and it doesn't really seem to fit the rest of the movie. I must admit that I liked the anti-hollywood approach Frank Darabont took. Not a bad try from a great Stephen King adapter. I mean this guy did give us The Shawshank Redemption (which was even better than King's book) and The Green Mile.
0143038419|5.0|What a wonderful Read! With over 600 reviews, I will only say, BUY IT! READ IT! Definately 5 amazing stars. Perhaps the 1 star people haven't experienced a tragic loss, or found the safe place to honestly examine themselves. A grand, insightful, and at times comical, Read!
0307387178|3.0|The author writes this story as a good \\"mystery\\" -- trying to analyze Chris McCandless to see what drove him. Overall, I think he did a good job.  I just couldn't identify enough with either Chris or the author to get much out of this book, other than it's a tragic and interesting story.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I heard a couple of the songs on the internet and on the radio and thought I'd pick up the CD to check it out. Color me shocked, but I love it. It's by far the most consistent album that Britney has put out. I'd call the sound a cross between Feist and Gwen Stefani. The lyrics aren't terribly insightful but the hooks are catchy and the music will make you want to move. It's an excellent album for working out to or getting ready to go out to the club.<br /><br />Don't judge the album by her less-than-stellar MTV Video Awards performance. I'm far from a fan but this album is great.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Doctor Who is finally back. I was eager for the to [[ASIN:B00005KB4D Paul McGann version of Doctor Who ]] to hit the screens even though that didn't feel 100% right. Christopher Eccleston's portrayal is spot on - quirky but lots of fun; serious when he needs to be. From the first episode, he seems very comfortable with the role. Great casting call.<br /><br />The story arcs are very good. Where the original version of the show had usually four and occasionally six episodes that made up a story, each 45 minutes story here is self-contained. However, many of the stories give tidbits into the bigger story of the season. It's a great way of doing the show.<br /><br />Effects are infinitely better than the original Who as is the increased use of location shooting. True Whovians won't be disappointed by lack of continuity: it's all there plus some new things that need to be filled in (the Time Lords are gone? How did that happen?) Those new to Who (like many I know) still love it since it fills in the gaps it needs to and doesn't make you feel like you are missing the joke at a party.<br /><br />All in all, great job all around. I would've taken any Doctor Who series. I'm glad we got one that has mass appeal to keep it on the air but stays ever true to the show that began it all.
B000BHP5EI|5.0|I purchased this characters for my grandaughter who loves the show, we watch it together everytime I am at her house, its our special thing to do together, we both like when Stitch takes the bite out of the surf board.  She is getting them for Christmas and will be thrilled.
0156030306|4.0|This novel will cause you to think about many aspects of life and human nature.  The premise of the book is very original and the story is quite moving.  Charlie Gordon is an unforgettable character whose experiences will touch you.  The book reads quickly but is quite dated.  While Keyes' occasionally clumsy style hampers this book from being a masterpiece, it is a novel I recommend highly, especially for readers who have an interest in psychology.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Rain Man is a truly special film that involves two brothers of two totally different worlds,mentally 'n so forth.  However,Charlie has this thing where he's all about money even to the point that he tries to play his brother,Raymond,for \\"a sap.\\"  In other words,Charlie is willing to do whatever it takes to get \\"the lion's share\\"  of inheritence...money and all!!  To me,I'd say that's a shame because it is so sad to have to take advantage of a family member as a pawn in the game...especially if that family member has a mentally or developmentally disorder.  I'd hate to think about what would happen if Charlie and Raymond were to never get along yet what Charlie would do to shake the cash out of Raymond's pockets,ya know?       I'm pretty sure that Raymond got \\"picked on\\"...did Raymond ever get bullied,mocked,made fun of,etc.  or did he just get left alone with only the burden of his own semi-normal brother(Charlie)with money-hungry out for blood issues just to get some cash on the side?!!  I can only help but wonder on since he lived at Wallbrook  in which I take it,is an adult foster care home or more commonly referred to as an AFC Home but you could only picture the part of if Raymond was in Special Education at one time or another...I bet he was the smartest student if he were a Special Ed. student since it's hardly ever that one comes up to an Autistic individual with so many advanced talents and/or abilities beyond belief!!  I'm not disparging Autistic people as a catagory,mind you but I was amazed at Raymond's unique \\"powers\\" if you wish to call them \\"powers.\\"  All I have to say in mental terms is: \\"What a weapon!!\\"  He's ahead of the ball game in his mental abilities on numbers(math),cards,knowledge on  baseball+\\"Who's On First?\\" let alone remembering phone numbers+names out of a phone book up to half-way through \\"G\\"?!!  That's unheard of,if you ask me!!!!  Dustin Hoffman has created an inspiration for me.       WHY?  Because I have a rare Autistic Spectrum known  as \\"Asperger's Syndrome\\" and my abilities are similar to Raymond's in terms of math,games(Video Games+Yu-Gi-Oh!),  numbers(birthdays+phone numbers...not address', though.)  but Rain Man has helped me to somewhat understand Autism but I'm disappointed to know that I can't find any movies with somebody that has \\"Asperger's Syndrome.\\"  I rented Rain Man a few years ago and my mother watched it with me to help me better understand Autism and the \\"powers\\" hidden within.  Therefore,being that I have such a rare Autistic Spectum...Rain Man has inspired me to find the \\"magic\\" within myself!!  God Bless Rain Man,You'll Always Inspire Autistic Truth!!                                                   *J. Allen*
0553208845|4.0|This short book contains some profound lessons about religion, faith and coming of age.  It is a book one can read quickly but it is not quickly forgotten.  While Hesse won't blow you away as a writer in some respects (style, plot, dialogue, etc.), he does a wonderful job of character development in this novel (though be aware that the book is primarily focused on one person).  This book is very enjoyable and can be digested by a variety of ages.  I imagine this is the kind of book that will yield something new with each reading.  Highly recommended.
1932100385|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to take responsibility for their own health.  Undeniable facts put forth by a credible scientist make the case for a plant based diet.  Read this book if you want to avoid the ills of a western diet.    When FORD introduced safety features in cars in the 1950's no-one wanted to  know about it.  We all wanted to think cars were safe.  Same with cigarettes.  Campbell shows the same psychology is true with a plant based diet.  We want to believe our diet does not need to change, but Campbell proves otherwise.  You will note many deleted reviews -- big money from dairy, beef, and poultry would like to silence him.    This book belongs with other nutrition classics by Dean Ornish and Roy Walford.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris Bueller is a comedy for all.  This movie is extremely funny and silly, and overall just a great comedy for everybody.  I love how Ferris does his best to make this \\"sick day\\" his very best, since it's the 9th day in the semester he missed, and concocts the plan to use Cameron's Dad's Ferrari. I really enjoy the funny comebacks, ridiculous stunts, and their attempts to avoid people they know.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|I reviewed most of The Original Series episodes during the initial DVD release which began in 1999.  So, the comments here focus on the new edition.<br /><br />I don't have an HD player or TV, but even at standard definition, the picture has never looked better.  The colors pop off the screen, scratches have been removed, and grain, while noticeable, has been reduced to a bare minimum.  Seeing the new remastering alters one's perceptions of the series.  I had never noticed the tear streaming down the crippled Captain Pike's cheek as Spock reveals his plan in \\"The Menagerie.\\"  Unfortunately, with the improved picture, flaws in the original production are also more noticeable: shadows from boom microphones are detectable, zippers can be clearly seen in many of the uniforms, and a certain hairpiece has never been more obvious.  Still, the picture shows the obvious care taken with the lighting and composition (very different from today's flatly-lit, smash & grab style of television filming).<br /><br />Of course, the primary focus of this new release is the new CGI visual effects.  Most of the new space shots are very convincing, remaining in the original spirit of the series.  Only a few of the shots are major deviations from the originals, such as when satellites are launched from the Enterprise in \\"Operation: Annihilate,\\" or the addition of a previously unseen ship in \\"Arena.\\"  Restraint seems to be the watchword here.  There was an earlier Enterprise model which was used for a few episodes, including \\"Miri,\\" and these shots are not as successful as those using a later model.  But as the episodes progress, the quality generally improves.  I would have liked to have seen a little bit more done, such as the replacement of some very dated viewing screen graphics in \\"Where No Man has Gone Before\\" and \\"Balance of Terror.\\"  The enhanced matte paintings of Starbase 11and Eminiar 7 are simply stunning.<br /><br />There are a number of errors.  The opening credits of \\"Where No Man has Gone Before\\" contain Kirk's opening monologue (\\"Space, the Final Frontier\\") which was not heard in the original broadcast episode and home video versions, and the sound mix for \\"The Menagerie\\" is botched, with music from Season Two tacked on, and the Talosian singing plants incorrectly channeled.<br /><br />The discs also include audio tracks in Spanish and French, although my partner (fluent in Spanish) tells me many of the Spanish translations are not faithful to the English originals.<br /><br />Bring on Season Two!ontain Kirk's opening monologue (\\"Space, the Final Frontier\\") which was not heard in the original broadcast episode and home video versions, and the sound mix for \\"The Menagerie\\" is botched, with music from Season Two tacked on, and the Talosian singing plants incorrectly channeled.

0060730552|4.0|Touching the Void begins with the story of Simpson and Yates's ambition to bag a Peruvian peak and, honestly, they come off a little cavalier about the whole adventure.  The climb starts out well enough, and the pair gains a lot of confidence as they ascend.  About halfway through the expedition, though, a terrible misstep by Simpson renders his leg useless and Simpson and Yates have to figure out how to cope with the descent.  Eventually, Yates perceives Simpson to be lost and proceeds to base camp alone.  With sheer will and survival instinct, Simpson also makes it out alive (obviously - we are reading his book) and his story is amazing.  Knowing the basic plot outline does not take away from the book - it is not about what happened per se, but how where one man would have died, another survives.  It is about what goes on in the mind of a man who is left in a dire situation, and in the mind of his partner, who did all he could to save him.  Simpson's narrative is simply incredible, and while reading it, I felt like I was right there with him.  A lot is added from Yate's short contribution, too.  This book is an excellent addition to a \\"mountaineering library\\" or for anyone interested in the human condition at extremes.

055358202X|1.0|The first three books in the series were riveting, but that is because they focused on action, plot, and relevant character development.  This 4th entry focuses on, well, not much of anything, and does not live up to anywhere near the expectations set by the first three.  In fact, I thought I was reading Robert Jordan at times instead of Martin.  Do I need entire paragraphs dedicated to the details of everyone's banner?  I'm beginning to think everyone in Westeros is walking around with a banner.  And a pile of background geneology is not really character development.  Or perhaps we are now going the way of the Jordan paragraph describing in 17 sentences how women are swishing their skirts followed by half a page describing everyone's clothes?  So people are moving here and there and back and forth like Jordanian brownian motion.  Yawn, yawn, yawn.    Martin would have better served his fans by chopping this one out and making the series 6 books.  Then all his fans would stand a better chance of making it to the end before he dies, unlike Jordan.  Or perhaps up next for Martin is the useless massive prequel a la Jordan?    I would have given it 2 stars, but oh you set the bar so high Mr. Martin.  To churn out this (comparitive) junk after 5 years makes me fear the wheels have come off the cart.  Did you perhaps cut a bit too close to the \\"interesting character\\" bone with the 3rd volume?

My favorite moments:Cause We've Ended As Lovers ( and the bass solo seperately), In the Prescence of the Lord, when Eric and Steve Winwood sing together, Mary had a Little Lamb, when Buddy Guy sustains that one note..... this should blow your mind.

For the longest she kept her guard up and refused to date him cause she was her daughter's ex (very good, Diane) but she gives in.<br /><br />And takes happiness by the ears and has a little fun. They live in one of the nicest beach houses you could possibly imagine, that looks down on the sandy beach.<br /><br />Jack has this heart issue and when he's overactive or having sex, it tends to act up. Amanda and Diane are at his side at the hospital when he has a heart attack but then he recovers.<br /><br />Diane and Jack are soul mates but they don't even know it till the very end. This movie is charming to a tee, very witty and smart. A little sexy is thrown in for good measure also. You get to see Diane naked (Ew) and Jack's but too (Funny).<br /><br />Cover Art: C<br />Story: B+<br />Characters: A<br />Length: B<br />Overall: B+<br /><br />4.1 stars.
0345360338|4.0|I can only imagine what a daunting task it was to attempt a sequel to Here Be Dragon's, one of the best novels ever written.  SKP did brilliantly, however, in this sequel.  At least it is a sequal chronologically.  If carries on from the Llewellyn-Joanna-King John story, to that of their children and the complicated ties between the Welsh and the English.<br /><br />It is touching, heartwrenching, and completely fascinating.  It is the story of Simon de Montfort's attempt to bring representative goverment to England.  It was doomed to fail though as it was an idea whose time had not yet come.  There are many other sub plots to this story.  The secondary characters are as fascinating as Simon himself.  There are many parts in the story where some tissue will come in handy although it never gets bogged down in misery.  As in HBD's, touching moments are sprinkled through the story in the most charming way.<br /><br />The only draw back is that it does get bogged down in a couple places due to the sheer number of characters coming in and out of the story.  A list of who's who would've been a big help.  Even still, it was a fascinating read by a brilliant story teller.  Highly recommended!
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors' L.A. Woman (1971) is Jim Morrison's swan song. After the sessions, he moved to Paris, France and mysteriously died on July 3, 1971. The music on L.A Woman ranges from the best of The Doors to tired and indifferent. L.A. Woman, Riders On The Storm, The Changeling, and Love Her Madly are as good as it gets, and as good as anything The Doors ever recorded. Been Down So long, Cars Hiss By My Window, and Crawling King Snake are also good, but would have been better had long-time producer and so-called \\"fifth Door\\", Paul Rothchild, stayed with the project. Hyacinth House and The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat) start out great, but sort of lose their way without Rothchild's professional guidance. As everybody knows, Jim Morrison was The Doors' creative and spiritual trailblazer, and by this time in his short, intense and highly intoxicated life, he was just about worn out. Staying drunk, rarely bathing, and showing up at the studio randomly by this time, The Doors and their music had become more of an obligation than a passion for him. And it shows in some parts of the album. L.A. Woman is a very good album on the strength of some really great songs, but it also sounds sadly fatigued and poorly produced in places. Being that it's Jim Morrison's last work makes it a worthwhile listen, and I especially like to hear the very last recording ever made of his voice. He whispers the lyrics of Riders On The Storm over his vocal track. It's seductively eerie, and a perfect way for the Lizard King to make his exit...
0307275639|5.0|Most of us think of the dying with horror.  We'd much rather have a root canal than spend time with a dying individual.  However, Morrie was not your average fatally ill man.  He had been a university professor and when ALS made teaching in a classroom impossible to do any more, he decided he still had more lessons to learn and impart before he died.  So he set out on a quest to learn how to die in order to really understand how to live and taught those lessons to a former student.<br /><br />One of the biggest lessons he learned and taught was to really listen to others rather than thinking his own thoughts while others talked.  It must have worked well because hundreds of people came to see him as his body steadily deteriorated.  And he learned to celebrate his end while he was still alive and able to express how important his loved ones and friends had been to him as well as hear them express their appreciation for him.  He also described the delicate emotional balance he maintained, allowing himself the leisure to cry and mourn his condition for some given moments most mornings before moving on with the day at hand.<br /><br />I hope never to develop something as terrible as ALS.  Yet, I hope I can develop and foster some of the strengths and characteristics Morrie exhibited in order to live the life I have better.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Belinda Carlisle's distinctive voice was always an odd fit to the slick, polished, adult-contemporary sound her solo work put forth.  The tradmark vibrato and growl are put to great use on Voila.  Her French is fantastic and the arrangments are fresh without being relentlessly modern.  A great set of musicians plays here on a nice cross section of pop and chanson.  Breathing life into standards like \\"Ne me quitte pass\\" or \\"La vie en rose\\" can't be easy at this point, but the job is done - and quite well at that.  And the punch of \\"Jezebel\\" as the finale is to die for.  So highly recommended - and here's to hoping this is the start of a new chapter.  Next up: maybe a few classic Go-Go's or old solo hits reworked into the style and sung in French?  We can only hope.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I like the Eagles, but the need for an exclusive release at WalMart of all places makes me angry. How much money is enough with this group? I'd love to hear the new songs, but I will pirate them via many online sites. Not one more dime to this very greedy bunch of musicians.
B000VAPZM2|2.0|It was never funny. You are the music in Me was WACK. And the dialogue bored me to tears. Ashley, Zac, Vanessa, Corbin and Lucas, spare me you has-beens. Zac and Vanessa are one of the hottest couples I've ever seen in my entire life but that still doesn't mean that they don't participate in the creation of fodder-filled products!<br /><br />I hate how these celebrities make money from these brainless adults and the no-talent-loving children who support this corporately-kiddy pappy pap. I don't understand how these teens (besides Zac (20?) and Ashley, who's she's freaking 22 already!) just perform other people's crappy tunes. Ugh.<br /><br />I am SO tired of them all. Corbin writes about Homework (*LOL*) and Vanessa coos her way through R&B-wannabe Pop tart music. And did you HEAR her sing that terrible song when she broke up with Zac and was on a bridge or something?? It made my ears wince in pain. She's a crappy singer, and I don't know who she had to make out with to get a record deal but she really, REALLY needs to step up her game and at least co-write 2 or 3 songs to get an ounce of my respect.<br /><br />I HATE all of you (minus Zac) and wish you would go away.<br /><br />The sooner the very better!<br /><br />Acting: D<br />Cover Art: B+ (the only thing decent about the movie whatsoever)<br />Story: D+ (clich&eacute;-ridden)<br />Characters: C- (LOL)<br />Length: D- (110 minutes too long)<br />Overall: D-<br /><br />2/5 or<br /><br />2 stars.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Each season of Veronica Mars just gets better and better.  The third season was fantastic. I can't believe this is the final installment.  I found the 3rd season as addictive as the first two. The cast of characters have amazing chemistry together, the writing (by Rob Thomas) is clever and intelligent, the plot lines are interesting and plausible. Everyone I have introduced Veronica Mars to has found it addictive.  I can't believe there won't be a fourth season!
B00009ZYC1|4.0|While the sequel wasn't bad it just wasn't as funny as this one. This is probably the only Shrek I actually care to own. I do plan on seeing Shrek the Third but I don't think it'll be this good.<br /><br />Shrek: An awesome ogre who starts off like the mean old, grouchy Grinch and finally comes around. Before that though he bosses people around and is very rude to them all. He eventually simmers down and then falls for Fiona.<br /><br />Donkey: This jackass is a hoot! Eddie Murphy plays the voice actor and he is as hilarious here as in some of his classic movies. Donkey is very, very silly but a little stubborn.<br /><br />Princess Fiona is a royal pain.

0064434095|5.0|This is one of a few books that have made it to the kids bedtime book rotation.  It's so cute and fun to read.  Our children just love this book.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I can be very brief about the new Eagles cd. It is absolutely brilliant and well worth the 14 years wait - a must for anyone who loves country music. It certainly contains some of the Eagle's finest music and lyrics.
B000MQ54OO|2.0|....three children (2, 6, & 7) walked away from the large screen surround sound TV about 20 minutes into this movie.  We should have rented it instead of making the purchase of the DVD.
0765316889|4.0|The Well of Ascension, book 2 of the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, is a very solid entry into modern fantasy.  It is slightly slower of pace then book 1 (The Final Empire); however, it's characterization is more thorough, and definitively more solid: Elend, Vin, Sazed, Breeze, OreSuer...  are all expanded upon.    Could the book, then, be shorter (as it's basically a build up to a battle for the city of Luthadel) ? Perhaps.  It certainly *is* slow during the first section, but it builds momentum until it literally roared through the final section (Snow and Ash).    It may not be the best fantasy book of 2007 (hello \\"Reaper's Gale\\" by Steven Erikson), but it is a good read, and a nice extension of a very good series.    I look forward to book 3.
1558908382|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  I love the characters and plot line.  The music is great and the feel of the whole atmosphere is great.  This is a fun movie to watch with friends and just hang out.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Well, blame me for being over-eager if you want.     I've just received my copy of TOS-R season 1 on HD-DVD/DVD. I do not have an HD-DVD player, so imagine my relief when they went with these hybrid discs. Very considerate for those of us who can't spend $[...] on every new gadget every 5 minutes.     There are 10 discs in the set, in a new design clear plastic container. 5 plastic cards list the details of each disc. Side 1 of each disc is HD-DVD, while side 2 is standard DVD. Both sides contain the same features.     When I heard of this set, I was concerned what they meant by 'season 1', since they've been airing the new versions all out of order. This set indeed contains the entire 1st season of TOS, including episodes which have not yet aired in their edited-for-more-commerical-time format. So NUTS TO THE NETWORK!!  Thanks to this set, you won't need to worry about the air-dates for 1st season episodes anymore. You get them complete, and uncut, as opposed to network TV, which brutally chops out 10 minutes of footage to advertise the latest fad.      The price is admittedly a little hefty, but Amazon had it for nearly $[...] off the reported $[...] price for pre-orders. I placed mine back in Sept.      The menu is fairly straightforward, set in the transporter room (as opposed to the Enterprise bridge, as the original versions did) with characters from each episode in the chamber. On the transporter console are the listed episodes on each disc, while bonus features on each disc are found under \\"Additional Data\\".    CGI remastering can, of course, only do so much for film as old as these episodes, so of course there was some grain in the episodes, but not so much that it deters from the enjoyment of the story.  Thanks to the clean-up work though, the images are also darker, a little more realistically shaded, which is, IMHO a major improvement over the blaring studio-style lights of the original versions.    I encourage anyone who reads this to get the set! I will not regret this!   Now I just want to know one thing - when's Season 2 due out?
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Man I cannot tell you how refreshing this albumn was toi hear. If you're a Pantera lover then this is the band for you. Every track hits with extreme force and makes just wanna go out and hurt something, LOL. I listened to it from end to end without having to skip songs because they sucked like on other albums from other bands. I firmly these guys are here to stay and for a while. I cannot wait for thier next EP.
0316067598|5.0|This book will give you a great feeling about America. Opposite of what you see on TV daily. Lone Survivor should be required reading for all high school and college students.   Mr. Luttrell is an American Hero and without reading this book few would know.  After reading the book I want more than ever to thank our soldiers for all their hard work and for keeping us safe.
0143038419|5.0|What a delectable read this book is! It's been a long time since I've read a book that gripped me with it's language, it's transporting story...and a voice that was as compelling as Gilbert's. The structure of the book is fascinating and clever...and at the end of the first section (her time in Italy), I had to put it down and just rest in the deliciousness of her writing! That has never happened to me before. I didn't want to keep reading too quickly, because I didn't want it to be over so fast. Although I come from a totally different faith background that the author, I nonetheless felt very connected to her journey...it transcends denomination completely. Her humility, courage and humor will stay with me for a long, long time. This book is a true, beautiful gem.
B000TT1QLE|5.0|Hyperion Records issued this complete 4-CD set for Hewitt's 2007/08 \\"Bach World Tour\\" (bachworldtour). The original performances here (WTC-I, WTC-II) were recorded in 1998/99 and still set a high mark for contemporary recordings of Bach's 48. Its largely what put Angela on the music map back then. Small bonus: the splashy cover art (with her gorgeous Fazioli piano) is certainly more colorful than the rather mundane original graphics. Such monumental music and high-caliber performances make this collection a solid investment for the classical music collector - or anyone interested in the timeless art of J.S. Bach whose Well-Tempered Clavier is in the great pantheon of keyboard music.  Compositions - 5 stars; Performances - 5 stars; Sound - 4 stars. More detailed reviews can be seen on the pages for the original two-set issues.     PS: In Spring '09, Hyperion released a new recording of the 48 from Hewitt's '08 tour period.  According to the artist, the foundations of her interpretations are largely the same now as then - but her phrasing, distinguishing of parts and rhythmic drive have developed in their sophistication and technique from playing Bach for the last ten years.  Also, the sound quality should be a notch higher with the latest recording technology.  Also part of the Bach Tour is a masters-class DVD (\\"Bach Performance on Piano\\").
B000PY52EU|3.0|Better than you expect. For a while the watcher is wondering just where this one is going. Jackson commands the screen and Ricci burns it up. The whole premises suggests something nasty, but it turns out to be a feel good movie. You can actually have a good time.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I've seen this show since it premiered on television.  Hot on the tails of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it seemed to fill a genre missing on television.    Although there is a season arc, each show stands on its own.  Miss a show and you'll probably be okay (although, I don't recommend it!).      If you like great actors, handsome stars, muscle cars, classic rock, horror, and family angst, and all without the reality TV, cookie cutter, BS that's seeped into the mainstream today, you'll like this.    This show has the feel of a cable TV budget, but...on the networks.  It's good for most members of the family (My daughter started watching it when she was 8), especially if the kids enjoy having their socks scared off without the slash 'em up scenes inherent to today's horror motion pictures.  Yeah, there's some blood, but enough to make it past the TV censors and into my living room!
B000TGCR38|4.0|A very well done WWII tale. This is the best this director has done in a while. The movie looks sharp. The actors are excellent. And the mystery holds to the end. This deserves a larger audience than showed up at the theatres. Action, sex and candy.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|The movie is exactly the same as the old version with no extras! The sound is 100% better especially the drums. The extra songs are on the 2nd disc. The songs are just as poorly edited as before in fact Whole lotta love is worse. The CD is not the same CD as before either. It matches the versions on the DVD but No Quarter is missing part of the guitar solo. On the movie and CD Black Dog is still edited yet on on the DVD that was released 4 years ago the verion of Black Dog was Complete. During the menu parts of the DVD there are cool parts of Whole lotta love middle scetions that should be on the CD!
0330491938|5.0|Given the current graft, greed, and \\"me,me,me\\" on wallstreet (what's new) this book might be a little outdated but is still one the funniest ironic books about New Yorkers, and especially Wall Streeters, I've read.
B000TXY2DO|4.0|The main selling point of this production of Puccini's 'Tosca' is the luxurious staging at the Arena di Verona, an outdoor theater built into the ruins of a public building dating from 30 AD. The stage is huge and the scenery needs to be huge as well for it to work effectively. And in this production it certainly does that. The stage is dominated by enormous broken statues of a noble Roman head and of its arm holding a sword and a crucifix. This is somehow transformed into the interior of the church in Act I, Scarpia's headquarters in Act II and the scene in which Cavaradossi is killed and Tosca leaps to her death in Act III. Act I features an enormous painting on which the painter Cavaradossi is working; it stands at least twenty feet high. And, without giving the coup de th&eacute;âtre away, it figures in Scarpia's dramatic entrance late in that act. The costumes, too, are rich, colorful and appropriate to the era circa 1800 in which the opera is set. Tosca's and Scarpia's costumes must have cost a fortune. The stage direction is fluid and telling without interfering with the action. Both the intimate moments and the crowd scenes are packed with interesting details. Someone entirely unfamiliar with the opera's plot would have no difficulty following the stage action. There are no liberties in which some European opera directors have indulged themselves except for one small, not bothersome solecism: the shepherd boy at the beginning of Act III is, instead, a little boy with a fishing pole sitting on the bank of, presumably, the Tiber into which Tosca latter jumps.<br /><br />Musically there is more to argue with. There are many DVD Toscas available, and this one is a notch below the best of them. I am particularly fond of the two that feature Pl&aacute;cido Domingo: [[ASIN:B0007P0LOI Puccini - Tosca / Kabaivanska, Domingo, Milnes, Luccardi, Mariotti, Bartoletti]] with Raina Kabaivanska and Sherrill Milnes, and [[ASIN:B000FTJEBM Puccini - Tosca (remastered)]] with Hildegard Behrens and Cornell MacNeil. In the present performance Fiorenza Cedolins is not in her best voice and although she portrays the drama effectively, there is a rough edge to the voice that is bothersome. Marcelo &Aacute;lvarez as Cavaradossi is in better voice but his acting is rather routine, I fear. Ruggero Raimondi has always been a very good Scarpia, but in this 2006 performance he is sixty-five years old and the voice is worn. Dramatically his Scarpia is malevolence personified, although I prefer MacNeil's dramatic portrayal. A find, for me, was Marco Spotti as Angelotti. He's a tall, good-looking man, a good actor with a baritone that rings with metal and fire.<br /><br />Musical direction by Daniel Oren and both the orchestra and chorus are good. They are given excellent recorded sound. Stage lighting, difficult in an open arena like Verona, is creative and effective. Videography is expert and unobtrusive.<br /><br />Sound formats: DD 5.1, DTS 5.1, LPCM stereo; Picture format: 16:9 anamorphic, NTSC; Subtitles: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish; Liner notes: English, German, French; Region code: 0 (worldwide); Disc format: DVD9; Running time: 119 mins.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|I wouldn't call any Bond movie truly realistic - we wouldn't like them if they were, would we?  But this one certainly has a more realistic feel than a man with metal teeth.  This one had more genuine emotion than most of the other films and although I was dubious when Daniel Craig was given the role, he really turned me into a believer.<br /><br />I have to say that this is my favorite Bond movie.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I borrowed this film from a friend and had no idea what to expect.  By the end of the first few minutes, I had placed the popcorn back on the end table and cleaned my hands so as to not butter up the rewind button on the remote.  I was totally taken off guard, but in a pleasant way.  I liked this movie for several different reasons.    First, Shortbus pushed the edge in terms of sexual content.  The movie contains both straight and gay sex scenes, so there is something of interest for just about everyone.  And many of the scenes occur in group setting, with all types of people of varying orientations taking part.  I appreciated the inclusive nature of the film, which is one reason why I liked the movie so much.  The scenes in the movie are not gratuitous, but are done in artistic tone.    The movie also touches on other issues besides sex, such as depression, suicide, the intricate nature and philosophy of romantic love, promiscuity, the machinations of the female anatomy/orgasm, the importance of being oneself despite whatever societal pressures might abound, friendship, compassion, and most of all, solidarity in a world of unknowns.    Shortbus is a very special place.  It is a place where most people can go and feel welcomed.  Whether you are straight or gay, thin or large, beautiful or not-so-beautiful, introvert or extrovert, young or old, liberal or conservative, and whatever other designations one could think of, it does not matter.  Shortbus is a place to commune with others and share whatever it is you would like to share.    For me, Shortbus is a metaphor for what the world could be if we all would be a little less judgemental and a little more accepting, compassionate, and empathetic.  It is a place we all could identify with if we would only let go of those things that bind us to our misconceptions and anachronisms.....

1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller is, quite frankly, the greatest comic book writer/arist ever. Hands down. He redefined Batman. He rescued Daredevil. And he is constantly making comic book history. See Sin City. First, the story is great, Marv is trying to... redeem himself in a sort of way by avenging the one person who ever showed him kindness (though I'd have to say, his parole officer also is 'on his side'). It's some sort of cross between the real world and the comic book universe. Some elements of both. And the artwork, I tell ya, Miller outdid himself. It's all pen and ink, and what Miller does with just a white page and black ink is magical. This is definitely a comic book must. Loved it.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|..Everyone is talking about Back in Black..howeever,this CD is sooo much more soulful. Her singing on this CD is a cross between Nina Simone, Macy Gray and Billy Holliday. She is wonderful and she should have released this CD in the US well before its November date. This is a CD that you can just place in your CD player and press play.     Favorites: (All) However, In My Bed, You Sent me Flying, You Should Be Stronger than Me.. and Honorable \\"Mr. Magic\\" Bonus Track    This is the dopest CD of music I have heard in a while...
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Like Moore says in the documentary, this isn't about Democrat or Republican, it's about what's morally right and what's wrong. When you have a 'for profit' health insurance and hospital system dictating who gets proper healthcare, and who doesn't, based on economic cost-cutting decisions, morality and true need gets thrown out the window, and people suffer greatly.  I can relate to the immorality of our healthcare system on several fronts.  A few years ago, when our company laid off many people, I was forced to look for health insurance on my own.  Apparently, because I had mild hypertension (under control with meds... millions have it... maybe a third of Americans), the many insurance companies I applied to stated that I had a 'pre-existing condition', and would not let me purchase insurance (even though otherwise I had perfect health)!  It took me over TWO LONG AND STRESSFUL YEARS to find a third-party 'agent' who 'pulled some industry strings' for me, and finally got me insurance, but at very high monthly cost.  And then earlier this year when I was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay of testing (I got arrythmia and irregular heartbeats), my so-called insurance company wouldn't pay ANY of my $8,000 bill, stating my admission was 'UNECESSARY' (I was found to have Magnesium deficiency, and 'stress-related' issues)!!!  Of course, it was a SHOCKER to think that a few cardiac tests and an overnight stay can actually cost that much to begin with!  If all this can happen to me, it can unexpectedly happen to you and your loved ones as well.  To this day, the appeals didn't work, and I have debt collectors hounding me DAILY to pay a bill that my insurance company should have duly covered!  My experience with the system is enough to MAKE YOU SICK in the first place!  Kudos to Michael Moore and his producers for researching and releasing a documentary which exposes the many shams, scams, and immorality of the frayed American 'healthcare system'!  Good work Michael!d work Michael!
1572814136|5.0|My Universal Waite cards had seen better days. In spite of my desire to start fresh with some new imagery I was drawn to the Radiant Rider - Waite.

B00006RCNJ|5.0|This video is an excellent concert by an outstanding orchestra.  Very enjoyable.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPFH|5.0|As critics have said; \\"Spidey's back and better than ever!\\" Number 3 in the trilogy really ties everything together. It doesn't leave loose ends hanging everywhere and it adds depth to our beloved characters. Spidey/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) encounters new villains Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom/Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and faces off against his best friend Harry Osborn/New Goblin (James Franco; who's arguably the best actor of the film), who's picked up where his father (Willem Dafoe) left off. A truly great film for any age!
B000R4SMCW|4.0|This is an enjoyable enough thriller - has that `seen it before' vibe, but raised above the level of the plethora of similar movies by its star performances and glossy veneer.  Plot wise, the obligatory twist in the standard murder investigation is that we see right off that Anthony Hopkins murders his wife.  The rub comes, when he looks like he might get away with it, and the only thing between him and freedom is a young up-and-coming public prosecutor, played by Ryan Gosling.  He is starting a new job for a new boss (Rosamund Pike, from Die Another Day - much sexier here) in a high profile corporate law firm.  So for him it becomes a question of conscience - can he let the murderer go, so that he can move on with his new career, or will he jeapordise his new career to do whatever it takes to `bring him down'.  So things are set up less as a whodunit, but more as a Columbo episode format.  We know he did it - but will the good guy figure it out?  None of the scenes have too much in the way of surprises, and the twists are fairly well flagged.  So what we are left with is a very glossy looking thriller with superior performances.  Sure, Hopkins has had better moments, and could be accused of sleepwalking through the movie, but Hopkins on autopilot is still better than the rest of the pack.  And the big surprise is Ryan Gosling - here, he puts in a memorable central performance.  The movie hinges on our buying into this character, and Gosling pulls it off.  It's Gosling that raises this to a 4 star movie.  It's clear the plot set up will never be entirely satisfactorily resolved, as evidenced by the two alternative endings where they played with how best to finish the story off.  In the end, they chose the best option, even if it does feel somewhat anticlimactic.   The other deleted scenes add little to proceedings.  All in all, despite a gnawing sense of familiarity, this works well, thanks in large part to the strong cast.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|The album is a classic, probably their best. And of course this is the original mix, unlike the version in the \\"six pack\\" compilation. I've never heard such a drastic difference in sound than what was done to the albums in the \\"six pack\\". Anyway, here it is in it's original thunderous form.
0060594896|5.0|I wanted a book to help my realize and obtain my goals. This book is it. Although the book is about 400 pages, it deals with many obstacles of reaching your goal. It briefly deals with low self-esteem, prioritizing, anger, and tells you how to deal with it. However, the main gist of the book is \\"If you believe, you can achieve\\" and this book gives you the steps (writing down goals, talking to people in the field you want to go into, making small steps everyday) on how to achieve your dreams. This book is highly recommendable for anyone who wants to lose those 10 pounds or become a millionaire.
B000UX6THK|5.0|The remastered video and audio are excellent, the menus are well-done, but most of all, the content is wonderful. Watching these discs reminded me of why I loved this show so much when it was originally on the air. It is too bad it only ran for two seasons.
B000VR824S|5.0|Clapton's universal appeal and longtime assocations with other stellar guitarists once again pays off with a spectacular lineup on this DVD--a real who's who of guitarists. A lot of these guys are getting up there in age (as well as Clapton himself) and it's great to have such a gathering of legends documented on video. Sadly, stellar guitarists do not have the mainstream appeal they once enjoyed (just take a look at the crap on the current Top 40), so this high-profile video gives these artists, some of them somewhat obscure, the attention they deserve. Sonny Landreth, for one--AMAZING slide guitarist. Right up there with Derek Trucks (also prominently featured) even though his style is completely different. The only sore thumb in this lineup is Sheryl Crow--what was she doing there?? All the other featured acts were those with guitar prowess. Eric can invite anyone he wants, of course, but obviously she doesn't fit that category. Willie Nelson's \\"duet\\" with Crow was awful. If anything was going to be left on the \\"cutting room floor,\\" as another reviewer noted about one of Jeff Beck's numbers, the Crow-Nelson duet should have been it. I too demand a re-release!    Overall though, a great DVD and highly recommended for all guitar buffs. The 4 hours will fly by! And get the Best Buy/Target version with the bonus extra DVD. It's only two more songs, but they're good ones.
B000LPS4BQ|2.0|I've been going through the list of 562 Blu-Ray titles offered on Amazon, and have to say I'm disappointed. So many heavy-hitters have not been released, and so much junk has. Sadly this film falls into the latter category.     Scooby-Doo had alot of potential--the CGI Scooby was done pretty well, the rest of the gang was fairly well-cast, and the actor who played Shaggy was all but perfect for the role. But the plot is terrible--I bought the DVD, watched it once, and have never wanted to watch it again. I can't understand why movies like this even see release on a format that is still very new--why waste money putting out junk like this when there are much better movies that haven't seen release? In my opinion (and that's all it is), a good 1/4 or 1/5 of the Blu-Ray titles available are like that. I just scratch my head trying to figure out who would *want* something like that in hi-def. Maybe if you have alot of money to waste, I guess.     Scooby-Doo is the kind of movie to buy from the discount DVD rack for $5, knowing not to expect much. It's B-movie fare, sort of fun--but not worth having in hi-def.     Hopefully the video format war won't drag on for too long--then movie studios can get down to releasing more of the big-name films they're currently holding back on.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Its just real Music.  From the first track (Fake Empire) to the last Track (Gospel), The album takes you on a journy of emotions.  Some good some not so good, yet all essential in making this album one of those must have pieces of music that everyone should own.  I first heard The National when I purchased ALLIGATOR. This being the followup I had much concern and reservation that BOXER could top the great lyrics and wonderful music play of ALLIGATOR.  Well it went above and beyond, Because you just can't pick one song to be the best. It's just a true album, not what were used to in a day of singles and filler tracks If you took one song away from the album you would lose the intensity of the album as a whole.  You must own this it is perfect for the car, the office/shop, or the home.

0823003590|5.0|I took classes with William Maughan, several of them in fact and I need to set the record straight. This is the best drawing instruction book I have ever read. It will give you fundamental and instinctive understanding of techniques that can carry over to any medium (that includes oil and pastel and graphite). Your people will never look like aliens again, they will be shockingly realistic (if you want that) or effectively abstracted (if you want that). It's just a shame that Bills humor and approachability doesn't come through in the text, but all the info is there.     In this book you will learn:    An extraordinarily simple and instinctive understanding of how shadows really work. Chiurascuro is a fancy word for how shadow forms are shaped and he'll teach you how to see it and render it. This is the secret to realistic drawing.     How value works. Value is really just how dark or light something is, but there is a logic to it that ties into painting and drawing. You will also draw MUCH faster with more convincing results. The curious color of paper and charcoal Bill uses in this book simplifies values to become easier to render, instead of ten shades of darkness he compresses it to five, thus making it easier for you to understand. From there you can apply it to white paper or canvas and any color medium you want. All tools he teaches you to use here are instinctive and excellent.     The proper proportions for the head and face no matter the sex, age, or ethnicity of the subject.     An incredibly fast, effective, and instinctive drawing technique that WILL translate into other media and other subjects.     Sincerely, these are the core fundamentals. These are techniques rarely taught in school or presented in books. There is no perfect, all encompasing art book, but this one teaches fundamentals the self taught rarely understand. Bills techniques changed my life, the book has those techniques and teaches them in an extremely streamlined manner. I wish I had this book fifteen years ago....
B00004W510|5.0|This album, front to back, is easily one of the best releases of the 20th century. From the opening number 'across the great divide' down to possibly the Bands best song, 'King Harvest (has surely come)', the album creates a one of a kind vibe of americana, rock n' roll, country and soul music.       Highlights include 'Whispering Pines', with its amazing soulful vocals by the late Richard Manuel, 'Jawbone' a unique composition with its awesomely layered harmonies complimented by a rocking chorus, 'When you awake' with its oddly superb guitar and one of Rick Danko's finest vocals, and to top it all off 'King Harvest'. One doesn't find a better song to finish an album than this number. With its mixture of Rock/Soul/Funk and Country it just takes you into this world of a farmer struggling on his farm.      Although everything about this album has been said on the other reviews, I felt the need to brown nose the brown album a little bit more. Being a musician, this album is to me as water is to a swimmer, essential.
B000W9MMPU|4.0|As a new HD-DVD owner, I immediately jumped at this set. While the features for Ocean's Eleven are the same as what's out there, having it in HD is a good bonus. But, what made this a must buy were the HD exclusive features on Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen.    First, O12 includes a new commentary with Soderbergh and writer George Nolfi, a selection of additional scenes and an HBO Making-Of Special. O13 also includes a commentary with Soderbergh and writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien and a Masters of the Heist featurette (though that one is available via a bonus disc at Target I believe). Also included are additional scenes and a couple other featurettes, most in HD.    Honestly, the picture quality isn't anything great but it is good. Of course, this isn't something I'm going to use to show off my home theater but for general home viewing, I know I will be watching these over and over again (yes, even Ocean's Twelve, a movie that has grown on me over the years).    Since it's only under $20 per movie, even if you already own O11 and O12, this is still worth the upgrade.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I have been greatly looking forward to a complete \\"Return of the King\\" soundtrack ever since the movie came out, and I realized how wonderful Howard Shore's music was.  What sheer delight, being able to sit in my living room for two hours last night, and again this afternoon, with two cats vying for space in my lap, the sound of knitting needles softly clacking nearby, during lulls in the music, while listing to the heavenly strains of melody wafting from the speakers.  The only thing missing was the fireplace and a couple of burning logs.    I would argue for this being the greatest score ever written for a film sequel, except that technically it isn't.  Peter Jackson set out to produce a single, gigantic epic, which he then broke into three parts for convenience.  In much the same way, J. R. R. Tolkien wrote the original novel half a century ago but split it into the familiar trio.  Thus, when Howard Shore was asked to create the music, he had the luxury of thinking in terms of the whole trilogy, and began to lay the groundwork in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" right from the beginning.  This gave him a tremendous advantage over, say, John Williams, who was at the mercy of George Lucas coming up with a new Star Wars script every few years.  He had to make up the music as he went along.    According to the \\"making of the music\\" video in the extended DVD version of \\"Fellowship\\", Shore knew from the outset that he wanted to create an opera.  If you read the excellent notes which come with the music boxed sets for all three movies, you'll know that he heavily employed a 19th century technique called \\"leitmotif\\", wherein every character of note, and every place, gets its own theme, and all of these melodies are skillfully woven together.  By \\"The Return of the King\\", all the pieces were in place for the grand climax of the epic.    The beauty of this composing technique is that I could sit there with my eyes closed, and follow the progression of the movie.  Certain visions and bits of dialog would pop into my mind.  I could see Deagol plunge into the water and lose hold of his fishing pole, only to find the Ring embedded in the mire instead -- to his undoing.  Or how about when the treasonous Saruman is standing atop Orthanc, up to his old tricks, trying to sow dissent among the ranks of his opponents?  Or that wonderful extended scene where Sam and Frodo see the sun shining for one last, forlorn moment upon a floral crown atop the fallen head of a Gondorian statue at the Cross-Roads?    My favorite track of all is \\"The Lighting of the Beacons\\".  I've seen that scene probably three times more often than the rest of the movie in its entirety, and the music plays a huge part of that.  Another good one is \\"Osgilliath Invaded\\", which features boy soprano Ben del Maestro's ethereal voice soaring above Pelennor Fields, figuratively speaking, as Gandalf rides forth from Minas Tirith, light streaming from his staff, to dispel the Nazgul on their fell beasts and thus rescue Faramir's band.    And, of course, there is the whole sequence of Sam and Frodo on the side of Mount Doom:  \\"Then let's be rid of it, once and for all.  I can't carry it for you, but I can carry YOU!\\"    If you've watched the \\"making of\\" videos for the extended \\"Return of the King\\" DVD, you may recall that Annie Lennox was working on a second recording, called, I think, \\"Live for the Day\\", but this never made it into the movie.  I was kind of hoping maybe they'd slip it into the boxed set, alongside \\"Into the West\\", but no dice.  They did, however, include something just as nice:  \\"Bilbo's Song\\".  I listened to it twice, feeling utterly haunted by the melody.  What a great way to finish the journey.    As with the other two boxed sets, the packaging is very attractive.  I have a minor complaint about the CD pegs being a hair too tight, but no matter.  Be aware, too, that the DVD is two-sided, which means there is no label side to absorb grease from one's hand inadvertently brushing across it.  It's happened to me a couple of times already.  That also means being extra careful when you twist the DVD off its rubbery peg, lest you get fingerprints on the surface.    The notes for all three movies keep referring to a book called \\"The Music of The Lord of the Rings Films\\".  I hope this becomes available sooner rather than later.  There are very nice PDF booklets available for download giving a track-by-track discussion of the music in all three films -- but this would mean listening to the music in front of my computer.  And that isn't always practical.  Perhaps it's time to invest in a nice color printer.    But why spend any more time reading this, when you could be listening to the music instead?  It was well worth the price for me.  Go for it!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is a great gift. Price is wonderful and I couldn't believe what great service I received. The whole order came in 3 or 4 days. Amazing.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I loved it. Sure there was a lot to the movie,but I did not have any problem following the plot.How else could they have done it and still make a great action flick.A lot of good action scenes,great emotion from the conflicts of the characters.I could not of expected any more.A lot better writing than Superman Returns,even though I did like it  too but I think that movie could of been a LOT better. I was not disappointed with Spiderman 3 at all.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Although I did not purchase this item through Amazon, I am compelled to write a review on it's contents.    Return of the King has some of the best music of the entire trilogy in my opinion.  Many of the tracks signal the hope of man against the seemingly overwhelming forces of Sauron.  Track 15, \\"The Lighting of the Beacons,\\" is touched with excitement as each tribe of people answer the call to aid Gondor.  There is tons of music that was excluded from the original ROTK soundtrack, which makes this investment sound expansive in its own right.  Fans finally have access to \\"Houses of Healing,\\" featuring Liv Tyler and the seminal \\"For Frodo,\\" that blasts as Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli do all within their power to secure Frodo's safe ascent to the pits of Mount Doom, without prior knowledge of course that he and Sam have actually survived the trek.  In addition, Bilbo's song is a freshing and chilling way to complete the album....perhaps suggesting we turn our thoughts to The Hobbit?    All in all however, this is a great album that I feel is punctuated by the music contained within \\"The Mouth of Sauron,\\" formerly, \\"The Black Gate Opens.\\"  It is here that you sense that despite overwhelming odds, good will prevail, either through honorable death, or victory in this battle.  A sense of peace envelops you completely as you listen to this album.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I consider this movie one of the few great fantasy films, though I must point out that the total number of fantasy films that are even good is relatively limited because of the historic difficulty of making fantasy films.  Even with digital effects, fantasy movies are notoriously hard to produce.  Yet, director Ron Howard and executive producer George Lucas, along with producer Nigel Wooll (\\"White Squall\\" and \\"G.I. Jane\\") and associate producer Joe Johnston (who directed \\"October Sky\\" and \\"Hidalgo\\"), managed to do a very wonderful job of bringing \\"Willow\\" to life.<br /><br />Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis, \\"Return of the Jedi\\" and the Harry Potter movies) is a Nelwyn living a hard but happy life with a wife and two children, when a Daikini baby arrives on the bank of a river adjacent to Willow's farm.  As all good Nelwyn know, Daikini's can bring no good and this Daikini baby brings even more, she brings with her the possible wrath of evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  The leaders of the local Nelwyn village decide that Willow must take the Daikini baby to the nearest Daikini and leave her.<br /><br />Things seem to be going somewhat well until the Nelwyn encounter a man in a cage going by the rather inauspicious name of Madmartigan (Val Kilmer).  Madmartigan swears that he will take care of baby Elora Danan if the Nelwyn will only free him from the cage.  After some misgivings, the Nelwyn free Madmartigan and the Nelwyn head back to their village while Madmartigan heads a different direction.  Let the adventure begin.<br /><br />The Nelwyn soon see an eagle flying by carrying Elora.  Willow gives chase, only to end up captured by Brownies.  However, Elora likes Willow and beautiful sorceress Cherlindrea tells the Brownies to free Willow because he is Elora's protector for the trip to Tir Asleen.  Cherlindrea also provides Willow with a wand, which will come in handy later.<br /><br />The Nelwyn come to a tavern (in a scene that is remarkably reminiscent of the bar scene in \\"Star Wars\\"), where they encounter Madmartigan again.  After an exciting chase, Madmartigan joins the Nelwyn to find Fin Raziel's (Patricia Hayes, \\"A Fish Called Wanda,\\" and \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips\\") island.  Unfortunately, Fin Raziel has been turned into an opossum, and Willow will have to turn her back into a human.  Turning Fin Raziel into a human involved a series of morphing shots that set a new standard for morphing, using computers to perform digital morphing for the first time.<br /><br />Though the movie has a lot of action and adventure to this point, there is so much more to go, including a battle with a two headed creature named Eborsisk after Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, trolls, Queen Bavmorda's army, twice, and a battle with Queen Bavmorda herself.  Will Willow save Elora Danan?  Will Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), daughter of Queen Bavmorda, grow to love Madmartigan as much as Madmartigan loves her?  Will Willow ever become a great sorcerer and be able to return to his village?  So much to learn for the intrepid movie watcher!<br /><br />I consider \\"Willow\\" to be one of the few good high fantasy films available.  Others include the recent Lord of the Rings trilogy, \\"Ladyhawke\\" and \\"Conan the Barbarian.\\"  Considering the limited number of movies in this genre, it would be easy to consider \\"Willow\\" a great high fantasy film, but the recent Lord of the Rings trilogy has reset the standard for high fantasy, and many aspects of \\"Willow\\" now seem dated in comparison.  Regardless, \\"Willow\\" set a standard for its time for plot, acting and special effects.  The movie generally took itself seriously (except for the Brownies) and the story is a lot of fun.  I am able to watch this movie over and over without ever tiring of the story.<br /><br />This movie contains a cast of hundreds, including the largest gathering of little people in many years.  In one of the extras, Warwick Davis states that this movie had the most little people of any movie up to that time.  I am unable to confirm his statement.  Among the little people are the late great Billy Barty, with more than 150 film and television appearances, and Kenny Baker, who most fans associate with R2-D2, though his acting career is much more extensive than just that role.<br /><br />This DVD also contains a number of extras, including a fascinating commentary by Warwick Davis.  I also enjoyed the feature on morphing, which improved the previous standard set by Godley and Creme in the video for their song \\"Cry,\\" though the morphing effect used in that video was fully analog.<br /><br />I do not consider \\"Willow\\" to be a family film.  The amount of violence and some of the adult situations should probably limit this movie to children no younger than about 11 or 12 years old.  However, I must admit that I would have loved this movie as a child of 8 or 9 years old.<br /><br />\\"Willow\\" works.  Sure, there are some problems in the movie, but when you create an entire world almost from scratch, you can develop issues.  I have seen some other reviewers claim that \\"Willow\\" is derivative of Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien said that he derived his Lord of the Rings books from an array of mythologies.  On the other hand, there is a lot of art and creativity in the film.

0446577391|5.0|Stone Cold, by David Baldacci, marks the third book starring the eccentric group of conspiracy theorists known as the Camel Club.  The two previous installments, [[ASIN:0446615625 The Camel Club]] and [[ASIN:B000WO0S8S The Collectors]], were very enjoyable books that introduced readers to numerous memorable characters.  Key among these characters is Oliver Stone nee John Carr.  The spotlight turns to Stone and the newest member, Anabelle Conroy.  Conroy, an excellent con-artist, brings the lone woman to the Camel Club.<br /><br />This, in my opinion, is the best book of the trilogy.  I hope this is not the last book in the series, as this is a group that I would be delighted to read about again and again.  Baldacci does a great job of bringing elements of suspense, drama, humor, and mystery to the novel.  Here the good guys and bad guys are interchangeable at times, with the good of the many sometimes outweighing the good of the few... or so the bad guys would tell you.  This book, for all its political machinations, comes down to the relationships between the mebers of the Camel Club and how they are there for each other through thick and thin.<br /><br />A delightful read.  Very enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book and give it five (5) stars for being what a book is supposed to be; fun, entertaining, and pure escapist fun.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and it is worth keeping. Very classy from beginning to end. The stars were all well selected and compliment each other.  Clair Forlani held up on her own against such big stars as Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt.  This story definitely has drama, romance, and comedy.  Good entertainment. I found the ending done with great class.
0143038419|4.0|If you've never been clinically depressed, I suppose you might find it hard to identify with what Elizabeth Gilbert has written in this book.  But no matter how you feel about her journey and her \\"journal,\\" and even if you begrudge the author her paid year abroad eating and spiritually searching and loving, it should be impossible to read Chapter 16 and not get the point.  Think she feels faultless?  Read Chapter 16.  Think she can't write?  Read Chapter 16?  Think she's gotten off scott-free?  Read Chapter 16.  Think she should just \\"get over it?\\"  Read Chapter 16.  Never been diagnosed with depression?  Read Chapter 16.  Don't have time/money to read the book?  Go to the bookstore/library and read Chapter 16.    If you can read Chapter 16 and still feel no compassion for her as a human being then of course you don't like the book.  If you can read Chapter 16 and still not appreciate the book, then perfection is what you're looking for, and your own search will be long.  The book as a whole isn't perfect.  The story as a whole isn't perfect.  But Chapter 16 makes it all worthwhile.    Ms Gilbert, god bless you for sharing a piece of your soul.  Chapter 16 was an affirmation that I am not alone, that WE are not alone.  The book as a whole was a journey of hope.  I won't go to Italy, and India and onward.  I won't be paid to share my pain and joy with the world and have it judged.  But my life was enriched by reading your book because of Chapter 16 and I will treasure those words forever.

One friend said the lemon bars were better than Starbucks! It's not stuff for everyday, unless you want to be fat. Love this book... and I love Colleen!
1400063515|5.0|Very interesting book. The author discusses a number of subjects that we are not trained or care to think about in our everyday life and which nevertheless impact our life much more often than we realize - such as the nature of our perceived knowledge about the random events, the trust we place in \\"experts\\", the imaginary casual links we see in random events, etc. He does it in vivid and insightful manner, and his style is both easy to read and thought-provoking.   I certainly found the book expanding my horizons and giving me a lot to think about, which is what I seek in a good book. I think it is worth every penny and every minute I spent on it.
B000FA57N0|5.0|The best sci-fi tv/movie world with the best characters ever created. Looks amazing in HD-DVD.
0525950079|3.0|I,like many. really enjoyed Pillars of Stone and anticipated the release of World Without End.  I purchased one on the release date and have been reading it since.  I have been very disappointed in one aspect of the book and do want to caution potential purchasers.  While I am only about 450 pages into the total 1,000 pages, I find that I have lost track of the number of graphic rape episodes.  While I am sure that rape did occur, I can not but help compare the treatment by John Grisham in his Time to Kill where there was no question that a rape occurred but we were not subjected to the tiniest details of how it was done, how it felt, etc.  The same can be said for the consensual sexual encounters between characters.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|it's refreshing with all the digital animation these days to view this classic in all it's beauty.  also refreshing is the peaceful rythm of the story (as compared to the many hyper-speed cartoons on tv). and, of course, we love the songs.
0316113077|2.0|This is indeed a gorgeous book.  But, like another reviewer, those that have given it 5 stars have only looked at the book and not baked from it.  I made the vanilla and chocolate cakes for a birthday party.  The instructions for baking the vanilla 9-inch cakes are obviously inaccurate as they say to bake the layers for 1 hour when, in fact, it should be more like 35 minutes.  Luckily I bake a lot and knew there had to be a problem.  The vanilla cake was okay.  We all liked the chocolate cake, but it has a much denser texture than most I make from scratch.  The sugar cookie recipe is totally inaccurate.  It had at least twice the flour in it as it should have.  I tried to rescue the dough, but with very little success.    The pictures are gorgeous and she is truly a talented designer, but it would have been a really good idea to have tested the recipes after they were printed...at least had them proofed several times as there are several inaccuracies.
B0002DB52M|3.0|Beginning last night, and passing into this day, I watched \\"Dogville\\" and its' sequel, \\"Manderlay.\\" I was hoping for something along the lines of Claude Berri's \\"Germinal\\" by way of John Sayles' \\"Matewan.\\"     Given:     1. that \\"Dogville\\" suffers terribly from its' slow pace,     2. that any sense of continuity between the two films suffers terribly from the loss of Kidman (replaced by a very limited Bryce Dallas Howard) and Caan (who was replaced by Willem Dafoe).     2. Von Trier's (and his teams') obvious ability as a director, as evinced by the power of their \\"Breaking the Waves,\\" and other films ...     ... Would you agree ...     3. That Von Trier's treatment of his socio-politcal themes (forgiveness and compassion have limits, ultimately power, even dignity, comes from the barrel of a gun, the unexpected outcomes of attempts at social engineering abroad) are pointed, Bergman-bleak and have some validity as critiques of American's bungling and costly efforts to influence events abroad?     4. That it's a shame Von Trier hadn't decided to drop his theatrical conceit (of adapting the modernist staging of Thorton Wilder's \\"Our Town\\") and chosen to shoot these scripts more naturalistically (like Terrance Malick's \\"Days of Heaven\\") ? The theatricality of the staging limited the effectiveness of the storytelling medium in both films. These scripts are solid agitprop, and would've made for some solid, if didactic, even operatic, visceral filmmaking. They would have made Von Trier the next Costa-Gravis.     6. That - as it stands - we'll likely never see the third part of the trilogy realized on film?     7. And finally, that I can be a terribly pretentious sod?
0684833395|1.0|I read this book and all I can say is...it was simply a disappointment. I realize it was satirical...however the characters seemed 2 dimensional and unrealistic, and after a while there behavior and responses were so predictable, I soon lost interest and the book became a slog.  I personally feel if Joseph Heller wrote it later on in life he would have had more life experiences to draw upon and could have written a much better novel.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This Nikon SB-400 is great.  I also own the top of the line SB-800, a fantastic powerful, do everything flash; an over-kill for reasonably close fill flash, & providing light in poorly lit areas that are not huge.  The SB-400 is perfect for these situations...it's compact, yet has light output well beyond the capability of the camera built-in flash.  Inexpensive, well built, & very capable.  I've had great results using it on the three Nikon cameras I own...can't attest to its results on other brabds.
B000VLE3IS|2.0|I will start by saying that I love Led Zeppelin. Completely. BUT.... there is, lets see....the original box set released in the early 90's...which I have. Then, there is the box set volume 2...I have that, too. Then there the Remasters...I have that, too. Then there  were the complete studio remastered set...I have that, and finally I have How the West Was Won and the DVD recordings.and, you guessed it....I have that, too. I like to collect what I dont already have. I already have all of the albums, so with the remasters, original box set, dvds and the studio remasters, oh....and the bbc sessions....I have everything, including bootlegs....that was recorded by Led Zeppelin. I just have to ask....what was the point of releasing this, besides to generate money? This is the thing that is irritating to me. Every song on these discs are great....but there aint a thing different, except for the artwork and album title and year. It would make me feel a little better if this were a celebratory album to mark their reunion concert. But it would make more sense to put out the live recording of the reunion concert than to release a regurgitation of the same recordings any true Zep fan will already have, and then some. I have absolutely no reason to buy these discs.
184195425X|1.0|The jacket promised me a survivalist tale about a boy stuck on a boat with a tiger.  What I got was something completely different.    Fewer than 10 pages in, the author goes on this rant about Agnostics, and how we're so much worse than both believers and Atheists because \\"to accept doubt as a religion is similar to accepting immobility as a form of transport.\\"  As an Agnostic, I found this to be reductionist and offensive.     However, the real problems started at about page 20 or so, when the author starts going on about the boy's religious epiphanies.  I'm not really all that interested in religions, so I thought, \\"Ok, maybe I can skip this part.\\"  Unfortunately, that part lasted for close to 30 pages, which is a bit too much to skip in a book of this size.  Around this time, I realized that the Life of Pi wouldn't be a survivalist tale at all, but would be some sort of retarded religious metaphor or something.    I was mad.  I was pissed.  For the fourth time in as many years, I had started a book that I couldn't force myself to finish.  Since I had only paid $5 for it, I knew that I wouldn't be able to reclaim much by selling it back to the bookstore.      So I decided to throw it into the recycle bin.  Maybe it's part of someone's toilet paper roll by now.
0316067598|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but this was a great book.  I heard about this book after reading that one of the SEALs on this mission recently received the Medal of Honor.  About half the book covers the imfamous Navy SEAL training and the other half follows the team of 4 SEALs in the mountains of Afganistan as they take on hundreds of Taliban soldiers. I seriously havent read a novel in probably 10 years and this book sparked my interest to get back into reading.
0440238609|2.0|As an avowed agnostic (Does that really make sense????) I went into this book knowing about it's anti-religious reputation and wanting to see what all the fuss was about. In the end I couldn't really answer that question. While the world that Pullman creates is very original and many of his concepts seem interesting his character development and plot are horrible. I found myself sympathizing with only a few of the main characters and disliking almost everyone else in the books.     The storyline jumps around and has a very hard time staying coherent especially through the 2nd and 3rd book. Although I was slightly interested in the story of the first book about midway through the second book reading the trilogy turned into work. Although I normally go through most novels in a couple days the last book took me almost 2 weeks. Everytine I picked it up the feeling was almost like waking up on a cold morning and having to get out of a nice, warm bed. Something you feel like you have to do but you really, really don't want to.     As for the anti-religious bent it is obvoius and although it didn't bother me directly the author's single minded determination to influence the reader did.    As many other's have stated... if you are a parent please read this book before letting your young children read it. At the very least it will get you ready to answer questions your kids may bring you about castration, female genital mutilation, pedophilia, and other topics that come up that seem fairly odd for a children's book. Granted most are mentioned in passing but that doesn't mean the kids are just going to ignore them.    I can't recommend this book at all. There are way too many good things to read out there and belive me this isn't one of them.

B00005JPWH|2.0|Into The Wild, Sean Penn's adaptation of the Christopher McCandless story; runs 140 minutes but feels more like 200.  Indeed, when the giant grizzly shows up at his bus I was praying it would put him, and us, out of our collective misery.  (Note to Hollywood, basing a movie on an interesting true story does not automatically guarantee an interesting movie.)<br /><br />What the film does do convincingly is reaffirm the idea that - despite considerable acting skill - Sean Penn remains a very simple-minded man drawn to naive, two-dimensional explanations for multi-faceted, complex questions.  What McCandless did is remarkable, what's remarkable about this movie is that it fails to provide any insight at all into why he did it.<br /><br />To risk life and limb, to renounce the advantages of bourgeois society, to abandon family, to live a life so solitary monks would think it odd - demands intense motivation.  We are offered the obligatory bait of Thoreau, but Christopher isn't running into the embrace of nature, he is fleeing the company of men.  We're thrown a scrap or two about contempt for the hypocrisy of society and worship of all that is material.  But Chris is only too willing to ride rails, hitch in cars of all types, and nestle into a hunter's cabin (bus) that has been well outfitted.  We understand most vividly what he actually is as he negotiates the soft underbelly of L.A. at night - he's a bum.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the story, Emile Hirsch is affable and charming - which helps perpetuate the myth that Chris is some well-intentioned social misfit having a bit of soul-searching adventure.  For this story to make any sense at all, that can't be true.  If the story had had human interaction, we might have gotten to know him.  (As Sean Penn's incredibly heavy hand points out at the end of this film, the happiness Chris seeks can only be found in sharing with others.)  But even on those rare occasions when we have the illusion of contact, (Holbrook, Vaughn, Keener), Chris is an emotional succubus, unwilling to share anything truer about himself than the word, \\"Alaska.\\"<br /><br />Although we never see them, three forces drive Chris.  The first is an intense anger, even hatred, lurking beneath that boyish smile - hatred for his parents, his father in particular, and ultimately, self-loathing.  (How else can we explain his willingness to let them agonize about his fate?  He wants to hurt them.)  Next is a staggering narcissism - his self-seeking is done in a void, as if all other people are merely extras in his movie.  Last is an addictive attraction to self-destruction, his self-destruction is an orgasmic narcotic, and it is also an act of revenge.  Hirsch and Penn are equally to blame for this failure.<br /><br />What's best about the movie - the Alaskan scenery and other jewels of cinematography - is also what's worst, it's a lovely distraction.  The quest that Chris allegedly embarked upon does not lead into wild nature, but into the wild heart.  Make it out of there alive, and you've got a real movie.motional succubus, unwilling to share anything truer about himself than the word, \\"Alaska.\\"    Although we never see them, three forces drive Chris.

This film puts a human face on what has become the paramount issue.<br />Mr. Moore has a gift for story telling.  He introduces us to real people whose life experiences show us just how sick our system of health care has become.<br />There are also a number of additional items on the DVD that add a great deal to the information that is in the movie.<br />I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn more about healthcare and the many ways in which our system could be made more responsive and humane.
1582701709|5.0|This book made so much sense.  I am now reading adjuncts to this book (quoted authors) and it is helping my focus to get what I want from all areas of my life.  It gave me a good basis to expand on.
1594489505|5.0|This book consumed me for the days I read it.  I could not put it down.  The characters were vivid and their stories so heartbreaking.  It really makes you think about how much control we have over our lives here in the states and yet whine about it.  The strength of character of these people in war-torn countries is absolutely amazing.  That anyone is still standing is a testimony to the human spirit and I think the author captures that beautifully.  I have not read the Kite Runner because I've heard it's difficult to get through, but after this, I don't know how I can resist it now.
B0001Z363W|5.0|After I bought Mafia a couple years ago I have become a huge Zakk Wylde fan. I bought this album a few months ago and I was really impressed how good it was. Like the album says its one of those easier listening (Zakk Wylde Style) albums after a night of fighting and drinking. When you wake up with a headache, take out Blessed Hellride and put this one on for a spin.     Also for fans of this album check out Degredation Trip by Jerry Cantrell...Excellent album...
0596101996|5.0|I knew next to nothing about javascript when I bought this book.  I am not a professional programmer.    After twice reading the theoretical section (the first half of the book) attentively, I was able to program some pretty interesting things with javascript. The book provided sufficient grounding for me to fly solo and use my imagination.  The reference section has been valuable for this.    I have read some of the negative reviews, and while I understand reviews that say this book could be more direct, practical and concise, I disagree with them as I found the author provided a very comprehensive narrative description of javascript including its nuances.    The author is in command of the topic, he provides solid targeted examples, and alerts you the salient points in those examples. He is teacher.    I have several other javascript books, but I return to this one regularly. Finding that the others are too cookbook oriented and do not give a sufficient grounding to solve complex problems.        The only thing that worries me is the quality of the cover and binding... while holding up.. my book is already looking tatty after just a couple of months.  The book is an accessible javascript companion.

B00000099Y|5.0|Years ago, when I first heard Tool, it wasn't an instant attraction.    Fast forward ten years...I had been listening to A Perfect Circle for a while, and, I had already started to delve into Tool's insanity.    Today, as I typically do, albums/CD's that appeal require years of maturation. This is to say, I wear them out in 1 month and dust them off frequently, and then, feel the need to share the love that took years to develop.     Album order of purchase (not heard) was ... Lateralus - 10,000 Days - Undertow - AEnima.  Hysterical... their best release (at least my fave) was the last I bought.    Are you kidding me? Forty-Six & 2 May be the greatest hard-rock song I've ever heard. Perfect in every way. Lyrically, insightful and intelligent. Musically....in your face one minute and the next....somber. Ending on a high of course.    The album on whole just shreds. Eulogy is an amzing experience. (2nd fave) H. ...assaults the mind. Third Eye...? Come on.... And AEnima...God, it makes me want to tell my sister to go (bleeep....bleeep).  Hardcore at it's best. Upbeat and driven.    I realize that their later releases are regarded as superior...but from a cat looking at this from a reverse angle, this to me is their best. The album just \\"fits\\". Hard, refined, thoughtful, all at the same time. And oh yeah, as many have mentioned, Danny Carey rocks like no other. Amazing beats. Worth the price of admission by himself.    I'm not a cult-fan...just a fan of great music. To be honest, this s**t blew me away. Not many bands/releases have EVER done that.    Best listening.

Both John Rzeznik and Robby Takac write great songs, and I can't wait for Greatest Hits Vol 2, the fan favorites!!! Rarities and more fun! If you get a chance to see these guys in concert, DO IT!!! In the meantime, GOO GOO DOLLS' GREATEST HITS VOL 1 - THE SINGLES is well worth the listen!!! And it makes an incredible HOLIDAY PRESENT for even the most casual GGD fan!!! Even if they just love IRIS or SLIDE, they will love this CD!!!!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Mike is accused of being \\"anecdotal\\" as if the stories are man-bites-dog. The problem is that the numbers (commencing with the numbers that show most bankruptcies in recent years to be caused in whole or in part by medical crises) indicate that Mike's stories are dog-bites-man, and if Gomer doesn't have health insurance when he arrives at the emergency room, he will die of rabies.<br /><br />\\"Gomer\\" is a real cute cop and doctor acronym in Chicago. It means \\"get out of my emergency room\\".<br /><br />As Mike shows, health insurance \\"providers\\" use racism in making their decisions; one mixed-race couple is denied care and the surviving wife believes this is due to racism.<br /><br />I believe her.<br /><br />I believe her because I was waiting for care while employed and insured at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to overhear a man of color, who'd probably, like me, had fathered children and done his best, being told to \\"get out of my emergency room\\" and schlep somehow to a food bank in subzero temperatures, a food bank that would not be open until the next day.<br /><br />The hatred of Mike Moore is the hatred of a narrative that corresponds to reality, and that story is the end of the American dream.

B000UR9TQE|5.0|This 1976 concert film is one Led Zeppelin item that really did deserve to be improved and expanded. In the November 2007 glut of new Zep products related to the film, this 2-DVD set is clearly the optimal purchase. (Note that this review was written after actually purchasing and consuming the item in question, which appears to be a real rarity so far.) The \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD set adds merchandise that will only be of value to super-diehards, and the new edition of the soundtrack album is apparently built around the new remaster of the movie itself and displays some odd editing choices. I have always felt that the purely audio soundtrack of the movie suffers from the lack of visuals - for example, all 27 minutes of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" makes more sense visually because you can watch the theatricality of Jimmy Page's stage performance, while merely listening to the accompanying soundtrack can be tedious. To a lesser extent, the same goes for the extra lengthy \\"Moby Dick\\" because while soloing, John Bonham could be even more enjoyable to watch than to listen to. So the film itself is the apotheosis of the entire \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" project, and this 2-DVD set presents much needed improvements in audio and video quality, with some bonus items that add value for the enthusiastic fan without becoming obsessive.<br /><br />Though I'm a lifelong Zep fan, I actually hadn't seen this movie in around 20 years. And I had forgotten how cheesy the non-concert footage truly is, with the fantasy sequences serving as little more than period vanity pieces that rarely rise above the amateurish. But who cares, because the concert sequences are stupendous, and in this DVD set they have been presented for maximum aural and visual impact (yes these two shows weren't the band's best, but they were still light years beyond most other rock acts). As for the DVD extras, the interviews and news segments have some curiosity value, but the true goodies are the extra concert sequences. We finally have official video for the blistering performance of \\"Celebration Day,\\" which was always my favorite from the old original soundtrack album. Other bonuses include \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" though the uncoordinated performance of this song deserved to be left out of the original film; plus a surprisingly heavy take on \\"Over the Hills and Far Away.\\"<br /><br />For many years the original movie and soundtrack were the only (official) live Zep documents available. For the real live goods, we now have the 2003 CD package \\"How the West Was Won\\" and the 2003 self-titled DVD set, which are considerably more hard-hitting and far-reaching than \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\" But even though it's no longer the definitive live document, fans have long deserved an improved version of the film.

Marcus Luttrell wears the Navy SEAL Trident and, for the responsibility of his decisions and actions on June 27, 2005, Marcus Luttrell has a cross to bear as well.      U.S. Navy SEALs are the toughest, the best of the best, the greatest elite fighting force in the world -- but SEALs are also human, and a month of Hell Weeks would not be training enough to make humans infallible or immortal.  When he is in deepest despair, seemingly forsaken on that Afghan mountain, Marcus turns to his Christian God.  It is in that moment of spiritual and physical surrender that God answers Marcus's prayers with His goodness and mercy.   The Pashtuns rescued Marcus Luttrell -- without this Divine Intervention he surely would have perished.  And God knows why Marcus Luttrell is the Lone Survivor.

0887306101|4.0|Were this book not a bit dated at 20 years old it would earn five stars (obviously this is not its own fault).  Since its publication, we've seen plenty of new markets (say, dot-com) and added plenty of new tools (say, instantaneous trading over the internet).  However, you're getting a collection of interviews from some phenomenal traders.  There are two things to get this book for:    1. The traders' stories.  You get the benefits of their experience without actually having to spent the time and money on having the experiences.  See how they live their lives and how quickly money can be made or lost.    2. How the traders are saying the same thing.  They're showing us that certain principles (of, say, risk management) are universal, but there are so many ways to make money that you need to figure out what you're good at and just do that well.    The text is edited well and everything is easy to read.  There is a helpful glossary, and the interviews are short enough that you can do one interview per sitting if you want to read this casually.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|Annie Lennox is always worth listening to. All of the songs on this CD are good but I didn't find any to really be extraordinary as I have on some of her previous CD's. She's never been an artist who records \\"happy songs\\" and this is not an exception. The music is generally dark (hence, the title) although there are a few glimpses of light heartedness.    If you like Annie Lennox, you'll enjoy the CD. If you're not really familiar with her music, try her Medusa album first.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is a phenominal actor!! I watch every show of his I can get my hands on. FRACTURE is by far one of his very best movies ever. Twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Ryan Gosling turns in a brilliant performance as the dogged, arrogant attorney who is too busy to handle such a mundane case as this. It turns around to bite him later. Hopkins is a brilliant killer who lets the system stumble over itself while he sits and watches in total glee.  I won't spoil the end, but it is worth staying in the edge of your seat for. And do stay there because you'll find yourself saying \\"NO WAY, THAT DID NOT JUST HAPPEN!\\"  Enjoy it as much as I did. Anthony Hopkins delivers every time.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|When I was 13, my older brother, a tremendous force in the direction to which my initial musical indulgences went. Walked in the door with this album under his arm.<br />I had at this point about 10 albums in my collection. I had Machine Head by DP and thought, wow, what a cool and classy looking album cover.<br />My experiences with Deep Purple's history outside of Machine Head were quite uninformed. But, one thing was for sure. When I heard the opening open quick drum roll, Tommy Bolin (need I say more?), and the opening lyrics.... Blew me away!<br /> I was hooked!<br />Producer Martin Birch's incredible recording of this lineup is a masterpiece.  This was, and is still to this day an absolutely essential part of my musical collection through 3 vinyl copies and one Japanese CD edition.<br />It is a perfect album and a sadly underappreciated one in the Deep Purple discography.<br />This is...Are you ready?? My #2 favorite Deep Purple album after Made in Japan. I think that it is simply incredible. It is funky, rockin', tight and simply some of the best boogie Rock-n-Roll to pour across my early ears and still to this day. NOTE: This is coming from a person that listens to an incredible amount of music from all genres (Except Rap/Hip Hop) and owns over 10,000 albums/CD's. The band is just having an incredible time here. It is obvious.<br />Plus, I feel deeply that any previous record by Deep Purple didn't have the production quality of  this album. Often the recordings on \\"In Rock\\" etc.  were incredibly compressed and seemingly muddy. To no fault of the musicians. The thing that to this day stands out for me with CTTB is how good these guys were at this time.  Largely still are as musicians and vocalists. Their last few records are very, very good.<br />Here, David Coverdale took the combination of his Ian Gillan meets Paul Rodgers/FREE era styled blues vocals to a new level. I had never before or since heard him sing this well. (Ok, maybe on his first pre-WS solo album?) Glenn Hughes is an incredible soul singer. He is an amazing bassist. Jon Lord is  brilliant.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|For all the VM fans out there, it is very bittersweet to watch the (extensive) bonus materials included in the VM season 3 dvd.  There is a season 4 pitch (about 10-15 mins), but it was just enough to get me salivating for more.  Then I realized the CW is a bunch of morons and there will be no more.<br />Anyway, for VM first-timers - you will enjoy this DVD, but, I highly recommend picking up seasons 1&2 first.  You won't be disappointed.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I don't mean to disrespect the views of those who gave this series a low rating because it showed animals hunting to survive, but I had to weigh in with a different viewpoint.  I am a big ole tree-hugger and I thought those scenes would be very difficult to view.  I usually don't make it all the way through these type of documentaries.  But I think this series does a great job of not anthropomorphizing the animals, not focusing on the cute and the cuddly and basically giving them names and inviting you to emotionally invest with them, right before having them die at the end!  This is a full vision circle of life series and yes, everybody has to eat to survive.  There are parts that probably will upset some folks.  But I think this is one of the best things I have EVER seen and I highly recommend it.
0440238609|4.0|About some of these ignorant reviews.  Its obvious you haven't read the book or the series, though it is not tolkien quality, it is not too bad in my opinion.   I know certain of you religious groups like to reserve the right to demonize other philosophies, and you start feeling threatened when groups (that your own religious texts shamelessly slander without basis or reason other than the fact that the authors didn't approve of gays and un-convertables *Pagans and atheists who wouldn't join the movement) this group in particular starts appearing to polish their image that--lets face it--has mostly been tarnished through the centuries by you types and not the individuals themselves, instead of them just knuckling under and pretending to be what you've been taught to knee-jerk believe them to be.  Lets keep the paranoia and hypocrisy to a minimum shall we?  Read the book, then write a review.  Its very simple.    Don't just slap someone in the face with the \\"we know you're evil because that's what we've been taught, so stop pretending that you're good\\" crap.  People who have decided not to embrace the mysticism side of philosophy believe their philosophy is the best just like you do yours.  So they write books, just like your members do, showing how X beliefs preferred by them are better than Y.  Ironically you're acting much like the people in the dark materials books with the \\"how dare someone have and opposing view point they must be evil\\" act.  You think Christians don't write books that are unflattering to other groups? Oh really?  Try the left behind series for starters.  In fact lets go to the left behind reviews and see how many negative and incredibly paranoid reviews from opposing view points there are posted.  I'll bet you its not a lot.  Somebody has more respect than somebody else don't they...    And P.S. If you don't like media with religious personages as the bad guy don't ever read The Three Musketeers either.  Though I have to tell you it was a verygood book. ^_^

B000Q6GXW2|3.0|I love 300 as much as the next person, but buyer beware, because of artistic choices by the director, the picture on this DVD is extremely grainy.  It is not the fault of the format, but the director.  It doesn't look bad on standard def, but the picture gets exposed on HD-DVD, making the most visually stunning movie to come out in years a marginal-looking HD-DVD at best.  Also, if you buy a Toshiba A3 HD-DVD player, the HD-DVD version of 300(NOT the HD-DVD/DVD combo) comes free (also with Bourne Identity).      Just be warned... this seems like it is a must-own for HD-DVD, but if you were planning on using it to show off the clear, stunning picture of your HD-DVD player to your friends, you (and they) will be massively disappointed.      Some people may not mind the graininess, but I for one payed big bucks for a HD-DVD player, TV, and movie so it would look clear, NOT grainy!
0316067598|5.0|The very existence of this book surprises.  It is the declassified story of a Navy SEAL, the author, and his grueling 2005 battle for his life against the Taliban and the subsequent struggle for survival that took place in Afghanistan.  First there is the fascinating tale of what it takes to become a Navy Seal and the intense challenges that reduced a group of SEAL trainees from 150 to just 30, 30 of the toughest who had what it takes and then what a group of 4 of these highly trained and disciplined men accomplished while fighting for our country.  A truly amazing story that at times feels like an adventure movie.  You will also glimpse the family at home, suffering; wondering if their son survived.  This tale builds and builds from one amazing scene of desperation, mental toughness, bravery, anguish and then hope to the next.  You will learn what it takes to become a SEAL, what it means to SEALs to serve and about what these men can do against the Taliban (without giving it away, what they accomplish in the face of overwhelming odds is incredible).  You will also learn about the Taliban's delicate relationship to the local Pushtin tribe, the tribe who are the true, ancient masters of the Mountains in the north and east of this rugged and backward country, upon whom the Taliban, and ultimately the book's hero, depends for survival.
0891419195|5.0|This is the best war memoir I have ever read.  I was drawn to E.B. Sledge's \\"voice\\" during the viewing of Ken Burns' mesmerizing documentary on WW II.  I checked his book out from the library in both audio and print version, listened to it all the way through, then read it.  I wanted to loan it to my grandson (19) so I bought a copy.  Grandson loved it too and son-in-law gets it next. I liked it for all the same reasons others have mentioned:  Sledge's clear, direct style (one hesitates even to use the word \\"style,\\" the book flows so organically), his decency and courage, his honesty (he gives his \\"worst of thoughts the worst of words\\"), his abhorrence of the necessity of this or any war.  The desolation of knowing your government has deemed you \\"expendable.\\"<br /><br />I wish I could have thanked this man.  He passed away in 2001.
B000W07EKW|4.0|I will start this with saying I HATED Live Free or Die Hard in the theater.. when I watched it s second timr.. I realized.. there was a bit, not much bit a bit more to it.. the whole Justin Long character being the lens of which we see the chaos the world is thrown in..    NOW.. relating to Bourne. Yes.. there were those long sequences of action.. with car crashes and chases.. that seemed inexplicable, almost.. BUT comparing it to a mindless action flick, like Die Hard 4 for example.. where the good guy has been shot.. bleeding is now driving a trailor tractor rig being shot out by missiles from an F-35 with the bridge he's on exploding RIGHT behind him.. as he jumps off the bright RIGHT before...    OK.. Bourne has always been about the action.. that's true.. It is by and far an ACTION film. BUT I also agree with a previous poster. In the first film we are stuck with Bourne.. trying to figure out WHO he is.. which follows through all three films ending in an almost CRUSHING revelation in the third film.. In which Bourne really blames eevryone for what he becomes *SPOILER* ultimately Bourne must find.. he has to blame himself. *SPOILER*    BUT.. the big thing really is.. that Bourne was from the beginning like most action heroes.. a reluctant one.. and still is.. unlike Rambo who would lay down the mantle for piece.. but be roused back into it. Bourne would have been content trying to piece himself together and stay a quiet anonymous existence living in India.. or wherever he wants.. without the gunplay and the killing.. these were never something that felt missing from him.. unlike Rambo who would never truly be himself without being through some.. torture or fight. Granted in some of the films.. we see some depth to Rambo, mostly through his end monologues (although there is a fantastic quiet scene in part II on a river boat, I am sure most Rambo fans know it). Bourne, on the other hand.. isn't that. He's very reluctant.. and sorrowful. Realizing what he was.. and.. trying for a quiet moment to atone for the wrong he has done.    This is what has really made Bourne something very different, unique and special in the action field. Granted.. he's part MacGyver.. and unstoppable when he wants to be.. but he's also one who can fight tooth and nail.. and then feel the depth of the wrongs he's done.    Ultimatum is a very odd film.. technically a PREQUEL (yeah it threw me off as well going in) AND a sequel rolled into one. Bourne finally discovers what he was.. and who he is. a very satisfying wrapup to the series.. unlike a previous reviewer, I can only say the Bourne series has gotten BETTER with each successive installment. And if there'a a fourth, I hope its great.. but if there isn't.. then that's ok too.. this is an END.. and a good one at that.

0786838655|3.0|Was a decent fantasy book for kids and the Greek gods being real was a nice twist but I'd have liked Riordan to have avoided stealing the Potter ideas. Three kids (two boys and a girl, just like Potter) are \\"special\\" and they go to this special school (no, not Hogwarts, it's Camp Half Blood) to learn how to be whoever they are (different gods, different abilities).   Instead of magic wands and spells, the kids each have a magic item (Annabeth has a cap of invisibility, Grover flying shoes and Percy has a sword).     There are many plot problems (eg, why doesn't Annabeth give Percy her cap when they fight Medusa so she doesn't know where he is? He sneaks up from behind and WHACK! off goes the head.  case closed.  Ah but that would ruin the little suspense that was there) but overall, if you like simple adventure/quest stories that are copies of most other quest stories with the names changed and a few nice twists thrown in, it's not a terrible book.  I wanted to like it more but it just didn't go over the top like I had hoped.    Another problem for me was that when Percy got to Camp Half Blood, nobody would tell him anything even though they knew the answers.  This, of course, was necessary only to delay the \\"aha\\" moments and for me, it simply broke the mimesis and took me out of the story.  Far too many \\"I can't tell you right now\\" for me.    But \\"Harry Potter meets Greek mythology\\" sums it up pretty well.    Tim

B00000JQFL|5.0|Now that they had finally made it big, the group decided the best thing to do was go all-out, issuing a double album - one half studio, one half live. The live segments of this are among the best music the group has ever made, bringing the group's jazz leanings to the fore (\\"Sun Goddess\\"; \\"Reasons\\" - my god, I love the soprano sax on \\"Reasons\\" and the keyboards on \\"Sun Goddess\\"! This group could've definitely made it as a jazz ensemble), keep the energy level as high as possible (\\"Africano/Power\\"; \\"Yearnin' Learnin'\\", way better than the original - they untap its potential, channeling the energy and adding an awesome wah-wah guitar), give the hits wonderful makeovers (\\"Devotion\\"; \\"Shining Star\\") and put on a ridiculously entertaining live show. Plus that version of \\"Devotion\\" - slowed down, very emotional, with a great bit of audience participation near the end - is debatably my favorite Earth, Wind and Fire song. Yeah, that's a wonderful tune! Add that to the ambitious, excellent synthesis of world music, jazz, and funk \\"New World Symphony\\", and you've got a perfect live album. The studio side scales back the ambition considerably, but still results in some fantastically catchy pop songs - the uplifting Top 10 hit \\"Singasong\\"; the wonderful ballad \\"Can't Hide Love\\", with a strong, heavily accented Philip Bailey vocal and awesome hummed coda (Yeah, they're humming and it sounds awesome!) and the spry, bouncy, gospel-pop title song. I'm not big on the remaining two songs: \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Celebrate\\", much like \\"Yearnin' Learnin'\\" or \\"Happy Feelin's\\", don't do anything the group hadn't done far better anywhere else, but they aren't too bad. But the live material is some of the best they ever cut, and the studio disc's no slouch either. It's not perfect, but it's damn close.
1595141715|5.0|Excellent premise, well-executed. There were a few spots where a bit of ambiguity got in the way (main character Hannah, speaking on a tape, leads up to each \\"reason/person\\" by describing the person and events using pronouns \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" or \\"you\\"). The cast of characters is quite large as well, which can be a tad confusing if you're not reading it all in one sitting.    Despite these (VERY) minor issues, Thirteen Reasons Why is a definite page-turner and deserves five stars. Others here have summarized the story well -- I'll just add that Thirteen Reasons Why has a unique premise, sympathetic characters, and a simply amazing intensity that rarely wanes from page one to the last word. A must read that is going on my listmania favorites.

B000NA1XSA|5.0|I read this book on the advice of my bass instructor and I couldn't put it down, and then wanted to re-read it when I was finished! if you love the Beatles you have to take this journey with this humble author. It is a backstage pass to the days, and lots of nights, of the creation of the music that changed music. In as unfiltered and modest a way as possible, Mr. Emerick details the events and personalities that shaped and continue to shape our culture.     From his exquisite descriptions you can see Paul climbing the stairs from the studio to the control room, the entire EMI building overrun with crazed fans, the smoking tent in the corner of the spartan studio, and John and Yoko (in her tiara) lying in a bed set up in another corner recuperating from a car accident during the startup of the Abbey Road album sessions.     Imagine seeing, helping create, A Day in the Life, and then going to the pub that weekend and trying to describe the experience to your mates. He did that for years with the most popular musicians in the world, and got precious little credit for his groundbreaking work in the process.    I have ordered a box of these books to give away to friends because it is one of the most entertaining and insightful books I have ever read and I want to be able to talk about it with them.    If I could give it 10 stars I would.
B00005JPS9|5.0|Recently watched this movie called Beowulf, this movie is based on the epic poem written by some anonymous poet. If looked from the superficial point of view it's the hero fighting with the dragon and other enemies but if we go deeper into this movie we will see that this movie is talking about the vicious circle of endless desire.<br />The one who start conquering the small desire come to a point where he also faces the mother of all the desires. Beowulf in the man who is in everybody, he is young, he is energetic, enthusiastic, confident, powerful and he is the one who has come fresh from God and this is how everybody comes from God and one day he starts going beyond the desire and in doing so he kills many sons of mother desire.<br />And in doing so he actually gives the ultimate challenge to the mother of desire but when Beowulf faces her, he starts losing his strength and control because this desire seems to be the ultimate and gives many promises to him and also she appears as the most beautiful woman which depicts that sex is the last and the mother of all the desire and the one who is ready to go beyond sex, he is ready to go beyond desire.<br />Whenever he listens to this mother desire, she gives birth to more desires resulting in destruction and failure of his kingdom and control.<br />When I was watching this movie this message came within me that the desire returns in many forms, the mind try to survive in every possible way and this is what is happening to man that every time he listens to the desire, to the mind, he falls again and again creating hell for himself but the moment he starts going beyond the desire the master, the king starts returning creating heaven for himself.<br />Man has a choice to be a Beowulf and fall or he can be a Buddha and rise....<br />Love<br />Siddhartha

0375505091|5.0|First off, it is easy to kick Annie Leibowitz around. No one seems to think her pictures are \\"all that\\" or the mythology of Annie overpowers the images. At some point, I just don't care. Annie didn't set out to reinvent the genre of editorial photography, but she did.<br />She brought a sense of pageant and humanity to her work. She's as honest as one could hope her to be with this book. Yes, her commercial work is somewhat charmed so forth. She still takes chances and brings risk into her work. There is profound craft to her images.<br />I'll always have the time of day for this photographer. She's had a long run and I hope it continues to reveal and entertain. So, Annie, if you ever read this (insomnia, insecurity) you're one of the good ones. You also never paid me back that five bucks I loaned you in Paris.

Trust me kid, nobody wants to be that guy. ---John McClane<br /><br />Bruce Willis dipped himself into shoes of John McClane again in Live Free or Die Hard. The action and the stunts are on the screen. However most of this we seen before.<br /><br />Willis is like a 1-900-be a hero when it comes to Die Hard movies. He is trying to stop  a computer mastermind who is  systematically shutting down the United States computer infrastructure. They crash the stock market, crippling America's economy. The plot seems intriguing but too out reaching for my tastes. Then on top of that, the mastermind kidnaps John's daughter Lucy, now its personal for McClane. Willis can wise crack at the most stressful times and makes it work.<br /><br />my favorite line from the movie is (after his car hit a helicopter in the air)<br />Matt Farrell: You just killed a helicopter with a car!<br />John McClane: I was out of bullets.<br /><br /> A hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) (a throwback to Willis's  16 blocks)is saddled with McClane for this wild ride and it works in spots.<br />However Clerks and Dogma's director Kevin Smith plays Warlock and tends to steal every scene he is in. When he is off the screen, you wish he would come back<br /><br />This is standard Willis hero stuff.  There is a few nifty stunts, but the dialog is similar to the other 3 Die Hards.<br /><br />So this one is for Die Hard fans only<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD

B000W8HC8I|5.0|Wow, what a story!      Similar to the humanization of Tony Soprano in The Sopranos, Jordan Belfort comes across as highly likeable despite his moral insolvency.  His brilliance and disdain for the SEC inevitably lead to a showdown between his guille and the justice system.      Sure, Belfort was a scumbag who defrauded thousands of greedy / gambling members of the upper class out of huge money.  He philandered.  At the same time I cannot help but recognize the abrupt lifestyle changes he encountered during rehab and jail, and respect the fact that he (apparently) handled them with dignity, maintaining his persona throughout.  That takes resilience, and, if his turn-around is genuine, his future looks bright.      Regardless of the moral component and Belfort's future actions, the book is very entertaining - a true page turner.  If you don't take life too seriously and enjoy the occasional gangster flick, you're in for a great time.  If you're a stuffy nor'easter or personally affected 'investor', then I recommend the canon of Chomsky or Benjamin Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\", respectively.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We love this game!  I bought it when my kids were 4 and 6, and we have been playing it for the past two years.   It is non-verbal, so it is a fun game that even a pre-reader can enjoy.  I especially like it because:  *  we have to think and puzzle out where to fit pieces, be able to look at shapes in different ways/angles  *  it is a game my youngest can play that doesn't bore me to tears.  I actually have to pay attention and use my brain.  *  there is no end-point in the difficulty.  We can play as a family, just kids, just adults, and it is always challenging.    I have given Blockus to several friends as birthday presents, and have only heard good things back from them and their children.  I bought another copy today to re-give to a nephew's kids for Christmas.  We gave it to them last year, and on Thanksgiving they told me they love it, but lost the pieces - could we please give them another set this year?

That said, I'm glad this disc is still in print.<br /><br />There's not a bad tune in the lot.  Probably my favorites are 'I'm going to fight for you J.B.' and 'California'.<br /><br />This is a CD that is fresh and innovative and listenable decades later.  I play it often, and it never fails to please with its ballads and its up-tempo 'Room to Move'.  Some call this a jazz album, but I think it's more bluesy than jazz.<br /><br />Also fun is Mayall's introduction of the band to the audience.  Also fun is his reaction to the audience pleading with him to continue playing, followed by 'Room to Move'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Really, a must have.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I thought this was going to be silly and stupid.  Instead, I found it to be wonderful.  I had scen the John Travolta pictures on TV and in magazines for months, and I feared his performance would be a huge disaster.  It is great.  He makes Edna seem so sweet and kind and good.  When she kicks up her heels and dances, it is a thrilling thing to see. There is true joy at work here.  Michelle Pfeiffer is even better.  Who knew she could be so mean?  Even when she's at her most villainous, you have to love her.  Usually Christopher Walken is just weird, but...like Edna...he is basically so good and sweet that you learn to love them as a couple.  Queen Latifah gets 3 big numbers, which I wasn't expecting.  And because I'm so old, I had no idea who Zac was; they have his hair slicked up and back instead of the fluffy Beatles cut I've seen in magazines.  And I was surprised by James Marsden singing and dancing away.  This is really a very good message movie about accepting people with darker skin and heavier body types.  I remember loving the original movie version, so I feared I might hate the musical, but I loved it.  Highly recommended!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Yes, it's true, every year it seems The Doors, John Lennon and Led Zeppelin release some sort of new hits collection, but there is no denying that \\"Mothership\\" has some of the best remastering of Zeppelin classics yet released. Like the recent Doors remasters, \\"Mothership\\" brings these classic songs that defined hard rock roaring into 21st century with new energy. No doubt some fans will scoff at certain omissions, there's no \\"The Ocean\\" or \\"Dancing Days,\\" but still, this is a highly enjoyable set for the casual listener. Disc 1 features some epic cuts like \\"Dazed And Confused\\" with it's spacey, otherworldly sound and \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" a ferocious blues number where Robert Plant and Jimmy Page let it rip. \\"Black Dog\\" is still a great, sweaty jam and \\"Immigrant Song\\" is pure adrenaline. \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" isn't just rock n' roll, it's classic music, period. But the reason this set should be given a chance is because not only have these numbers not lost their edge, now they shine brighter with excellent digital remastering. Drums and bass are crisper, clearer, the individual snap of John Bonham's drums is more defined, Plant's voice soars more clearly and Page's guitars are sharper and louder. \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" is an even more beautiful number here, with adequate volume now restored it breathes like the haunting piece that it is. Disc 2 has an equal balance of energy and mellowness with the almost tropical \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" that has more defined drums and guitar here. \\"No Quarter\\" crawls with menacing grace. The epic \\"Kashmir\\" is here, remastered with a volume more suitable for it's orchestral scope. \\"Mothership\\" is no doubt not the last Led Zeppelin collection we will see in our lifetime, but you can't deny it's merits. This is classic rock for the ages, the kind of music that reminds us what rock n' roll was all about before it was turned into a corporate factory of recycled dummies and sounds. If anything, \\"Mothership\\" can introduce a younger generation to the real hard rock that will always out-do what's out now.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|First off I love the show...so a thousand stars for that... now on to the actual item. The only complaint I have is that I had to return it twice. Not because of scratched disks like everyone has been saying, all the disks work wonderfully, but because the hard case was cracked. Amazon's shipping has been incredibly lackluster as of late and I get more damaged goods than usable ones.... anyway...    It is a lovely set. Don't listen to people that complain about being \\"milked\\" because they had to buy this set after they bought all the seasons...If you don't want to be \\"milked\\" buy the edition that will make you happy, even if it means waiting for it! I hate reviews like this because they don't contribute anything. More importantly it isn't about the studios \\"milking\\" anyone! They are a business... and one should expect by now that when a DVD comes out, if you want a more \\"definitive\\" edition... WAIT! I never buy DVDs I'm really interested in until they've had a few new editions. I save money and I get all the features that I want. It takes patience, not even brilliance, to figure out that you should only buy what you want.     Next-ly... I find it incredibly wrong that Amazon is letting people post pictures of the \\"International\\" edition. It's bootleg. Illegal bootleg (if you can't tell by the misspelling ie \\"Editiong\\" among others...) I received the illegal bootleg as a gift (by accident, the person didn't know any better...we got our money back by fighting for it). The disks might as well be coasters. The ones that do work look like they are from a video camera taping a TV. I know this might make bootleggers angry since I am telling you all the big secret... but basically for something like this it really is better to just buy the real thing (the set or even the separate seasons) It will save you the heartache of throwing $100+ down the drain.     Bottom line, great show, great set, don't let people rip you off. :-)
B000RF1QDI|5.0|I saw this film for the first time in the theater on beautiful 35MM.  Marveling at the pathos of the story, the beautiful cinematography, and the truly artistic CGI, I loved it.    Then came a DVD with a dreadful transfer and I couldn't bear to watch it.  Not even on my 46inch HDTV.    But for some reason this obscure classic was released on HD DVD.  It is a wonder!  You can finally appreciate the majestic vistas of Heaven, the dark fire and dusty walls of Hell, and the delicate, fragile colors of this world.    Show off you HD DVD player and HDTV with this movie.  They've probably never seen it and will be shocked that they've missed such a good film.    Way to go HD DVD.

0316067598|2.0|I will say upfront that I did not finish reading this book.  That said, I have some criticisms that support many of the other negative reviews.<br /><br />I went to Navy boot camp on 25 February 1999, about 1 week before Luttrell says that he went, in the same place and in the same program.  He says that Great Lakes, Illinois had the worst blizzard in 11 years at the time, but this is not true.  It was cold (especially for fair-weather folk), and we did have snow and ice, but there was no blizzard.  But we did not have to run outside in that weather as he described; we ran on an indoor track unless the weather permitted, and there were days that the weather was warm enough for us to run outside in reasonable comfort (in the opinion of an Ohioan, anyway).<br /><br />He also says that he shot an M-16 at a live firing range in Navy boot camp, but I know that we were only allowed to fire fake M-16's with laser-guns attached for simulated shooting.  I heard that they did not start shooting live rounds until after 9/11.<br /><br />These inaccuracies about something that I know make me much more skeptical about the other things he had to say.<br /><br />The most offensive thing that I read in the book was a line about when he'd graduated from sniper school.  He mentioned that it was the duty of each special ops member to refrain from bragging about himself.  So he is not allowed to say whom his sniper class voted to be their top graduate (or whatever they called it), clearly indicating that they voted for him.  Maybe it was a joke, but I think it showed an utter lack of humility or good taste.<br /><br />The book (at least the half that I read) is full of his self-praise and condescension.  He can do no wrong and has always done the best.  He has always overcome the greatest of obstacles because of his A+ attitude.  Doubtlessly whatever you have done, he's done something twice as great.  He's a big talker.<br /><br />My recruiter had spoken like this (minus the self-praise) to get me to sign his papers.  I suspect that this book might have a similar goal in mind.<br /><br />I did not read the second half of the book, so maybe there are redeeming qualities there that I don't know about.  I was especially curious to read his description of the Pashtuns who took him in, but I did not get that far.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the book only if you read it with a skeptic's attitude.
B000F48D3C|5.0|I have a copy of this, and bought this to give my grandson.  I think this was pretty accurate.
B0000033TE|5.0|Brain Salad Surgery, ELP's 1973 crowning achievement.  There is a lot to like about this record.  The music of course, which was highly innovative for that era.  The interesting and thought provoking cover art.  Even the title of the album was innovative.  In the short span of four years and five albums, Emerson Lake and Palmer truly pushed the envelope of early progressive classical/rock fusion to another level.  In fact they took it right to the top of mainstream music on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />This Rhino Records release is truely a lost treasure.  There are still a few floating around out there in music stores, especially the used CD section.  I recently picked one up, brand new and still sealed up, for only $10.  Boy am I glad I did.  If you thought the recent (2007) Shout! Factory releases were going to eclipse this one...think again.  It's already getting bad reviews for mastering/mixing flaws.  The packaging is kind of a mixed bag as well (see my review).<br /><br />I feel the sound on this Rhino re-issue to be superior.  I have them both and have done a critical comparison of the two.  The Shout issue has a more prominent bottom-end.  The problem is it's not isolated to the bass or kick drum, it's an over-all increase in the entire low-end spectrum, even effecting the vocals.  The impression is the vocals getting slightly \\"buried\\" in the murkiness and sounding a little more distant.  The Rhino issue has a much cleaner and crisper sound.  I also liked the packaging.  The 3-D cover that changes as you tilt it is cool.  I also prefer jewel cases to digi-paks.  The booklets that come with each are completely different.  Both are good.  I've never really heard it stated, but I guess Rhino releases are \\"limited\\" to a certain amount of copies.  That's the only reason I can think of as to why this version is now unavailable.  They really should think about re-releasing it.
B0000022WA|5.0|If you have seen the newer version starring Lindsay Lohan, but haven't seen the original version, you're in for an unexpected treat when you watch this Hayley Mills classic. It is 1,000% better than the remake. Hayley Mills outshines Lindsay in every respect. And the supporting cast, including Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara add to its charm. Highly recommended. The remake fails miserably to stand up to this classic. You might want to try the Parent Trap and Parent Trap II Collection on DVD.
0316067598|5.0|I had heard of this story in Summer of 2005.  But nothing prepared me for the shock after reading this book and know what these brave heroes went through!

It is also a true story how an act of decency has led to such loss of life. And another act of decency saves Marcus.    I only wish the description of the landscape of where the action was happening (Murphy's ridge) was a little bit clearer. It was hard to imagine the landscape (Maybe it is my own lack of imagination).

B000H0MKOC|4.0|A dark comedy that pokes fun at the tobacco, gun and liquor industries. Specifically it focuses on the career of Nick Naylor. Naylor, played by Aaron Eckhart, is a single father who loves his job. He is a tobacco lobbyist slash \\"spin doctor\\" and his whole job is to make tobacco and cigarettes look good enough that people will buy them or at least not stop buying them.<br /><br />Eckhart delivers one laugh after another and keeps the film moving and entertaining. He also proves that anyone with the right charisma (and a good smile) can get away with anything. One of the funny things about this film is that there is virtually no smoking in the film.<br /><br />There are lots of guest appearances by actors such as Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody and many more that add to the entertainment value of the film. I think smokers and non-smokers will get a kick out of this political satire.<br /><br />Feature wise, there are a bunch of deleted scenes, the usually \\"commentary\\" options, an interview segment with the author, director and star of the film from Charlie Rose, and two documentaries on comedy. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.

Now I have my first child and when I was looking for her first cloth book and saw this I knew we had to have it!  It is so adorable!  The cover is really soft and I washed it first thing (you never know were it was before right?) and it held up great and no color change with the washing and drying of it.  My 8 month old daughter LOVES it!  You do have to be careful as the bird is on a string, I read that in another review.  So I only let her 'read' it when I am with her, we absolutely love the story and the fact it cloth is even more lovable!
B0000027RL|1.0|Seattle rockers Pearl Jam released their debut album Ten in late summer of 1991.<br />In 1991, rock and roll was doing just fine as that year veteran rockers like Rush released Roll the Bones, Queen released Innuendo and Genesis issued We Can't Dance. Also, all metal was alive and well as Metallica released their fifth album (a/k/a The Black Album), Guns and Roses issued the double Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, Queensryche were about to release Operation:LIVECrime. Also bands like Megadeth, Slayer, Alice in Chains (who were a METAL band on their debut album and opened fro metal acts like Megadeth, Anthrax and Van Halen and weren't a grunge band much to popular opinion) and Anthrax were putting out great works at a time of hair metal schlock like Poison, Firehouse (admittedly those bands did stink).<br />However, in late 1991 and early 1992, the same city that spawned great bands like Queensryche, Heart and Alice in Chains sent us two of rock's WORST BANDS Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Both of whom would help turn rock and roll into the cesspool it is now.<br />I don't like Nirvana and I don't like Pearl Jam as well. I grew not to like the album due to MTV's overkill of the album. Then, I decided to try and see if it would grow on me as I got older and owned this album in 1996 but it failed to grow on me as I don't see anything great about Pearl Jam (I played Ten over and over to see if I would like it but I fell asleep each time and eventually sold this and their other albums in favor of Iron Maiden's Best of the Beast 2-CD set released in October, 1996 and realized my life wasn't as bad as either Cobain or Eddie Vedder or the \\"so-called\\" Gen-X (I was born in 1976 which was on the cusp of X and Y so technically I am Gen-Y)).<br />My first awareness of this band which comprised of no-good hacks like Stone Gossard, Mike McCready, Jeff Ament and Maalox spokesman Eddie Vedder was after MTV aired the video for Alive. I was just like, is it me or does the lead singer Eddie Vedder need to drink some Pepto Bismol! His voice is so damn annoying (sounds like he had a stomach ache)!<br />Then songs like Even Flow, Jeremy, Black, Once and Why Go all cried \\"SOMEONE SEND THE DUDES TO THERAPY SESSION\\". Musically, it was just mindless drivel and monotonous. Jeremy was awful and the video was just ridiculous.<br />I am not a troll, I just call it as I see it. However, Nirvana and Pearl Jam were all the same to me. Two whiner bands who needed to go to their rooms for being babies.<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!some Pepto Bismol!

B000Y179KO|5.0|The new Eagles 2 CD set \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\" was surprising to me in many ways.  Chief among them:  #1. After 28 years' hiatus, I didn't know if they still had it in them.  The much fabled huge egos could have easily gotten in the way but clearly they did not (well, not much anyway).    #2.  You would expect that Don Henley would dominate the album as he has been the most successful solist of the group and has dominated most of the touring sets. Instead I feel Glen Frey is the real standout of this effort.  Crystal clear, strong vocals that belie his age coupled with beatiful musical interpretation and timing.     #3.  I expected a lot more preachy, politically laced songs.  Sure there are a few but I was afraid they would be the majority rather than the minority.  And the ones that do appear here are so musically fine (especially \\"Frail Grasp\\") that one can overlook the lyrics regardless of your politics.    So was it worth the 28 year wait??  OF COURSE NOT!  We wanted some new stuff sooner. But it was surprising and satisfying.  Dennis Monroe  Clearwater, FL
B000000OA6|5.0|Queen's sixteenth US release Innuendo was first released in February of 1991.<br />The album would be the last Queen album released during Freddie Mercury's lifetime.<br />In between The Miracle and Innuendo, the band cancelled its contract with Capitol Records for the US and Canada and went with a new label created by Disney called Hollywood Records which initially had a distribution deal with Queen's first US label from 1973-83 Elektra (Hollywood's US and Canadian distribution would change to PolyGram then Universal now Universal/Vivendi). Also, the band wanted to bring back the classic Queen sounds with a modern touch.<br />At the time, the Innuendo album was being recorded, lead singer Freddie Mercury was very ill and could only record as much as he could and guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, bass player John Deacon and co-producer David Richards to create what was to become one of the greatest farewell albums EVER (as I found out in April of 1992 when I recorded the album onto tape then got on CD that Christmas).<br />The opening UK #1 and US rock radio Top 20 smash title cut to Innuendo is a great, innovative, multi-sectioned rocker to kick off Queen's farewell. The song brings back the feel of earlier epics without sounding like any of them. Yes guitarist Steve Howe appears on the track playing classical guitar in the middle. Roger said the track Innuendo was and I quote \\"Oscar Wilde meets Led Zeppelin\\", end quote. Great song. Also, its video was groundbreaking despite the band do not appear in it save for computer generated images designed like different artists (John (Picasso), Freddie (Da Vinci) and so forth). \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" follows and is a great number. This song's video was a classic black and white clip of the band being silly complete with penguins and gorillas. The next track was the third British single but first single released from Innuendo here in the States called \\"Headlong\\". This rocker is an awesome song. When I first heard this track in January of 1991, I said Queen can still rock. The song reached #3 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts and was Queen's biggest American radio hit since \\"I Want it All\\" two years earlier. Next is the pop-rocker \\"I Can't Live With You\\" which is an excellent song with alot of Brian guitar works. Next is \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" which is one of the band's best ballads, period, containing a stunning haunting falsetto-sounding vocal delivery from Freddie despite his delicate condition. \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" follows and we rock out again in full speed with good lyrics and makes you want to drive 110 on the highway.<br />The second half of the album starts with \\"All God's People\\" which is the 90s Somebody to Love but not sounding like or re-recording Somebody to Love. The ballad \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" follows and is a excellent ballad which sadly had the last video Queen made with Freddie before he died and his miming of the words \\"I still love you\\" was a fitting way to end his filmed performance career as his AIDS ailment was getting to him. We then go silly with \\"Delilah\\", a song about Freddie's cat and a nice up-number. Next is the Brian-laced rocker \\"The Hitman\\" which sounds like it would not have been out of place on any metal album. Great song! Next is \\"Bijou\\" which is a great showcase for an epic guitar solo by Brian with synthesizers and beautiful vocals from Freddie that appear in the middle singing about his cat. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" closes the album in the same way that The Golden Slumber Medley ended Abbey Road, majestically. The song expressed Freddie's need to continue making music and living life, even in the face of imminent death (he would die of AIDS a few months after the release of this album) and the music was stunning.<br />Innuendo when released gave Queen their first US Gold selling album (meaning it sold 500,000 copies in the US) since 1984's The Works and hit #31 at a time when hair metal schlock like Poison, larger-than-lifecrooners like Michael Bolton and divas like Mariah Carey infested the US music landscape.<br />Sadly, Innuendo also marked Queen's final album to be released when Freddie Mercury was alive as he would pass away in November of 1991 at the age of 45 of AIDS becoming rock and roll's first major AIDS casualty.<br />Innuendo is RECOMMENDED!hael Bolton and divas like Mariah Carey infested the US music landscape.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|I admit, I read the spoilers and Season 7 episode summaries (DVD insert) before watching the final season of my favorite TV show. I always wait to watch the show only after a complete season has come out on DVD, as catching the occasional, commercials-ridden WB/CW episode would be frustrasting and incomplete.  So, it was like Christmas before Thanksgiving when my long-awaited Gilmore Girls Amazon order arrived this past Tuesday. Since Tuesday, I've done little else besides watching episode after episode until I finally made my way through the entire season this evening.<br /><br />I was expecting the worst.  Review after review bemoaned how all standards had gone to pot after Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino split when the CW didn't meet their demands.  I was prepared for forced dialogue, the stellar wit that set this show apart (and kept its viewers on their toes) taking a nose dive.  What I found, however, was that the Gilmore magic was still there, witty dialogue intact.  Yes, a lot of things happen during this season, a sort of \\"pulling out all of the stops\\" in terms of plot twists and turns.  Yet Christopher and Lorelai's marriage and subsequent divorce plans didn't seem as contrived as it sounded when I read complaining reviews and the DVD insert.  Yes, it was  a rebound, impulsive marriage, but it was made more plausible by Christopher and Lorelai's (lifelong) history, Rory's paternity, and Lorelai's personality.  I even briefly rooted for this doomed marriage, despite my preference for Luke.<br /><br />Other storylines: lucky Lane, who proves that one time is all it takes, knocked up during her disastrous honeymoon, and even luckier Sookie (pregnant with baby #3 after her husband's noncompliance with a vasectomy mandate); though both women eventually come to terms with their pregnancy and see it as a blessing. Luke gets partial custody of April (I wish I had been that together in the eighth grade); unfortunately, Lorelai's written character reference for Luke in the custody battle threatens Christopher, cementing divorce plans.  The one plot twist that I thought was unconvincing/completely out-of-character was Logan's \\"now or never\\" marriage proposal. Usually, Logan wasn't a now-or-never kinda guy, and he only recently turned 25 himself. He should have known to give Rory her time and space before expecting such a commitment.  I guess the writers wanted us to know definitively that this relationship wasn't going to work out whereas Luke and Lorelai were (hopefully) in it for the long haul. Though if you analyze Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" lyrics (Lorelai's unintentional \\"serenade\\" to Luke during a tipsy, countrified rendition of this early 90's hit), or see the movie, \\"The Bodyguard\\" (which I haven't), you get that the two lovers never get together, despite their mutual sentiment and goodwill.  But the kiss on the lips sealed the deal for my interpretation--hopefully, they'll work through whatever is holding them back and get together.<br /><br />I love Luke's characterization (though the grunge flannels and backwards baseball cap gets a little old); he's such a sweet guy.  Kirk is over-the-top as usual, beyond quirky but a little short of DSM-IV, nonfunctioning insanity.  Paris and Doyle are so cute together, and Doyle will follow wherever Paris leads.  Richard and Emily are still Richard and Emily, but they show their appreciation for Rory (and Richard tells Lorelai that Stars Hollow's tribute to Rory is as much a celebration of Lorelei as it is of Rory--I was bawling unabashedly during this scene, along with Luke's \\"I just want to see you happy\\" gesture to Lorelai).  Emily seems to be one of those \\"one step forward, two steps backwards\\" types of people (the way she treats her maids and \\"socioeconomic inferiors\\" is an obvious sign of unhappiness, i.e., how an uppity attitude backfires).  When you see her softer side, you see her dark side in full-form a few scenes later.  Yet it was sweet whenshe contrived a plan to keep Lorelai in her life.  She was going to spot Lorelai a loan to improve the Dragonfly, with Friday dinners (mutated to business get-togethers from time-to-time) part of the interest-free arrangement.  But Lorelai promised that she would continue coming to Friday night dinners without any other reason than to keep in touch with her parents, as these dinners were now a well-established ritual.<br /><br />Yes, like other fans, I'd like a ring on Lorelai's finger and an exchange of vows with Luke, but a kiss will have to suffice.  Yes, like other fans, I'd LOVE a WB 2-hour TV movie to wrap up loose ends and let us glimpse into Gilmore World for just a little longer.  But my rewatching the seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls will have to suffice for the time being.<br /><br />Loved the extras that featured a day in the life of Keiko Agena and the Gilmore Fashionistas.  I love Lorelai and Rory's wardrobe...all those beautiful clothes just sitting in storage (did I mention that Lauren Graham and I are about the same height and build?)...But mostly, I just love this show.

Yes, like other fans, I'd LOVE a WB 2-hour TV movie to wrap up loose ends and let us glimpse into Gilmore World for just a little longer.  But my rewatching the seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls will have to suffice for the time being.    Loved the extras that featured a day in the life of Keiko Agena and the Gilmore Fashionistas.  I love Lorelai and Rory's wardrobe...all those beautiful clothes just sitting in storage (did I mention that Lauren Graham and I are about the same height and build?)...But mostly, I just love this show.  Kudos to the creators and writers of this very special TV series.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband and we both love it, excellent for long car rides.  It's the perfect blend of classic Bruce Springsteen and a new edgy sound.  This has become one of my top 5 favorite CDs of all time.
B00000634J|5.0|Calling this amazing collection of songs \\"emotionally brilliant\\" is really the only way to describe it. You have one of the most successful and powerful singer-songwriters of all-time, captured almost flawlessly in this 20-track collection of songs.     You have the early favorites such as \\"Imagine\\", \\"Instant Karma!\\" and \\"Jealous Guy\\". Then you have the four songs included from the Double Fantasy album. In between are a bunch of forgotten favorites that you will surely recognize upon listening to them. I'm really surprised the Christmas song is included here as well. I love that song, and I know some people who've said it moves them to tears every December. \\"Mother\\" has some of the most honest feelings ever put on tape. That song FLOORED me the first time I played it. His version of \\"Stand By Me\\" surpasses the original, and \\"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\\" used to be a popular radio favorite at one time. The same can be said for \\"No. 9 Dream\\".     There will never EVER be a songwriter able to combine emotion, talent, beauty and importance ever again. There's only one John Lennon, and while some may argue Paul McCartney and the Wings had more success, it's impossible to deny John Lennon deserves credit for having nonstop honesty throughout his career and just as much talent for writing solid melodies. Lyrically John Lennon is truly gifted and had absolutely no fear saying whatever he felt like. That makes him a brilliant musician. Pick up this 20-track collection today. It doesn't GET any better.
B000UR366S|4.0|What incredible poetry created by this eternal genius.  I felt that Joni had looked right into my heart and expressed all the beauty and sadness of a century.  My mind has been tortured by all the changes in my lifetime wich have been detrimental to our nation.  Now through sage advice she tells us how to survive the troubles. Advice once given to me by a friend from the former Soviet Union. Take it on the chin, find comfort in the internal life and ride out the storm.  Joni's music allows one to access those beautiful memories of nature's magnificence and the hope that the millenial generation can somehow pick up the gauntlet and face the challenges not only for themselves but for all the dreamers, idealists and lovers of this Earth.
B00005M91K|4.0|A beautiful work of cinematography -with a very good soundtrack - amazing visual journey through the East, West, North and South- it shows that there as many different places and people on this earth as there are colors in a rainbow.. and all without any spoken words!
B0002S947K|4.0|This incredibly sexy, soulful voice cries out for hope. Trouble, Forever My Friend, is on track with the instrumentation and arrangement.   We need an artist of this quality to uplift us with his passion and his talent.  I would buy all of his albums if his view turned more towards the light.
0930289234|4.0|Watchmen is probably one of the greatest comics ever written. Unfortunately in today's modern time the story has lost a lot of what made it great because the direction that the industry has taken. With everyone going for darker, grittier stories Watchmen just hasn't been able to stand the test of time. A great story but, you can't go in with a regular state of mind when reading it. It's a great story and worth the read.
B00000I600|5.0|yaz, depeche mode, pet shop boys, bronski beat... none of that would have been possible without this.  but don't let that turn you away.  great songs, great sounds and arrangements from Bell, totally committed performance from Almond, sometimes obscene.... Klasik.  unlike a lot of the stuff from that time, this one has aged 0%.  synths with blood and heartbeat.
1563899426|5.0|Fables is easily the best on-going series in comics and this is were the series started with the Mystery of Rose Red's murder. It introduces the series main Protagonist, Bigby Wolf a.k.a The Big Bad Wolf reformed. The story is written by Bill Willingham who is writing another great series called Shadowpact for DC and also wrote Day of Vengeance the Infinite Crisis tie-in. Anyway, a very good read and will get you hooked.
B00003CXAA|3.0|I am a true fan of the Godfather series.  I watch it on TV everytime it is on.  The thing about TV is you never know what is goin to be edited out to meet the alloted time.  My disappointment in this product is it too has been edited.  I will continue looking for an unedited version, but in the mean time I can enjoy this selection and not have to contend with those darn commercials.
159562015X|1.0|I was excited to read this book and hopefully use it to re-direct or jump start my career especially since this book was so highly touted in BusinessWeek.  However, after over 6 months of failed attempts to get the online quiz to work, I have to label this book a BUST!    The first 30 or so pages get you excited learn about a well researched strengths guide.  I couldn't stop turning the pages wanting to learn how each strength thrives in different job positions.  However, it's a stop down to get to page 31 and realize you have to take the test.  The rest of 175 pages are explanations to the strengths you scored high on while taking the online test.  The problem is the online test never worked.  It kept giving me an error message.  Thinking the sight was down I tried taking the assessment at different times and days all with the same results.  Then to top it all off, NO RESPONSE from their support time.    It's very dissappointing that a book proclaiming succeeding and growing in leadership appears to have none when it comes to their web site.  This is sad because the online assessment is the biggest part to understanding the book and utilizing the book.    Buy another leadership/strengths book since this one appears worthless.
0307275639|5.0|My mother passed away three years ago from ALS. It has taken me this long to purchase and read this book. I now wish I had read it before she passed away - I would have learned some things that might have helped me to help her. This book is so inspiring - that a person can be so positive in the face of death is beyond me. I highly recommend this book to anyone - not just a person dealing with a terminal disease but anyone. The \\"life lessons\\" are fantastic. I wish I had the opportunity to meet and talk to Morrie - I think it would have helped me cope with all that my family went through. Please make sure you read this one.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|This is a very interesting and entertaining documentary, placing the Who in the context of their social era, their conflicting personalities, and their drive for musical success.  The bottom line though, is if I want to introduce a friend to the Who, the essence of the Who's spirit, I will show them the Kids Are Alright.      The \\"Six Quick Ones\\" are the highlight.  They provide entertaining and illumaniting views into each bandmember (prompting my wife to comment, \\"Wow, I never really appreciated how awesome Keith was as a drummer\\").  The movie iteself moves at a good pace and has some interesting tidbits, but very little that the serious Who fan would find new or surprising.      The most frustrating aspect of the movie is that we never see a song in its entirety.  The Who's power as a creative force is not apparent in 20 second clips (a scissor kick or a windmill or a lunatic drum bit is now a rock cliche -- what makes one appreciate the Who is seeing that these were not poseur moments, but part of a constant, all-out assault on the senses in each song driven by passion and competition).    The Kids Are Alright, by contrast, is a fan's love letter, the uber-mix tape to show why this band is great musically, and generates such passion amongst its fans.  The full-length clips, interspersed with interviews from assorted literati, cogniscenti, and roustabouts paint a picture (albeit an Impressionistic one) of the Who's unique and self-contradicting blend of utter seriousness about the saving power of music, pop-art self-mocking, and all-out joyous abandon.  I dare you to watch Baba O'Riley or the montage of \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\", and at least not walk away with the impression that this band is something special, worth investigating further... Amazing Journey is a good one to watch to learn more.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I first saw Phantom of the Opera with an unbiased view: I knew nothing about it except the names of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I was mesmerized! I was emotionalized! I was hooked! Perfect acting, perfect casting, perfect music, perfect productions. OK, it would have been better if Minnie Driver had sung with her own voice--that's my only complaint, and a minor one at that.<br /><br />I have watched the film over and over and am equally moved each time with this desperately sad story of unrequited love, but then again this ending of this version has possibilities.<br /><br />Anything I say about Gerard Butler will be redundant, I am sure, or of  Emmy Rossum or Patrick Wilson, so I will focus on the music. I have listened to the soundtrack over and over and have formulated the opinion that Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has parallels with Beethoven's music. It is as rich in the romantic tradition of high and low notes, much musicality, repetition of same and similar musical phrases and songs, each version engendered with a new slant. Has a musically trained person noticed the parallels? I would like to know.<br /><br />Footnote: After my familiarity with the movie version, I ordered the CD of the stage production with Crawford and Brightman. Ug, I resold it on Amazon. None of the voices were right to my ears after Butler, Rossum, and Wilson.
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|However, I will try to come up with some that do some justice to this amazing movie. First of all I'm not big into romantic movies. The only reason I went to see this one is that it had beatles music in it. WOW! While I was sitting in the theatre I was thinking to myself: \\"How can a movie be this great?\\" I mean the movie is perfect! The acting is superb, and not only are a few of the actors great, all of them are. The story is flawless, it takes the conventional love story and revs it up. The best part of this movie is how visually unique it is. At times it looks as though you are watching something that a person on crack would see. The blending of the beatles music is perfect. The songs go right along with the story. They did change the beat to some of the songs and sang them differently but they pulled it off very well. In fact the soundtrack was so good that I drived for and hour just to get one. As soon as the DVD comes out I am going to be first in line to get it. If you like beatles music I highly recomend that you get this movie. If you don't then still get the movie because it has a perfect story that is, well, perfect! You can't find a better movie than this one right here.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|It just wasn't Toy Story II.<br /><br />But it was pretty good. The ability the folks at Pixar have to simulate water, hair, fur, mushrooms, flame, raspberry syrup, and mayhem continue to astound me. They can also tell a good story with some surprisingly honest turns.<br /><br />Be warned, this is not a film for small children. My seven year old son found a scene displaying several trapped, dead rats to be very disturbing. As a matter of fact, I found the scene disturbing too. A bit too much. Too much like coming around the bend in the fog at the concentration camp in the film \\"Life is Beautiful\\" on that pile of emaciated. . . okay. We won't go there.<br /><br />But the film was amazing. It felt like a real movie. Sometimes I forgot I was watching a cartoon. Some of the ideas were hard for me to choke down, like the rat's method for directing the garbage boy's cooking. But overall the film had a very classy feel, perhaps due to all those gorgeous panoramas of Paris at night.<br /><br />I think the exposition needed a little more thought.  It was too long, and it felt contrived.  But just hang in there because once the film gets going, all is forgiven.<br /><br />This is the best \\"misunderstood artist\\" film I have ever seen.  There is a nay-saying father character who wants his son to keep away from humans and stop trying to be a chef.  But then, when dad realizes how much this dream means to his boy, he rallies the whole family to help him achieve it!  In too many of these \\"misunderstood artist\\" stories, the family authority figure is seen as nothing more than an obstacle.  In this story the theme is: let your family in on your dreams and they will help you achieve them!<br /><br />My favorite part of the film was the critique of critics delivered by the intimidating Anton Ego near the end. Critics, so he writes, thrive on negativism. Their writings are less valuable than the garbage that they so label as garbage. He claims, however, that critics can do some good if they discover something great and lead the public to partake of it.<br /><br />I would say critics have another valuable role. They can make suggestions on the subject of what to do better next time. They can advise the artist as to what did and what didn't work. IS ANYBODY LISTENING?<br /><br />That \\"Your Friend the Rat\\" short on the DVD just didn't work.  It didn't hold a candle to Mike's company musical in \\"Monster's INC.\\"<br /><br />-RJCic to partake of it.    I would say critics have another valuable role.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth, the stunning BBC nature documentary, uses the latest in film technology to take you to the most remote and fantastic places in the world. To see these films is to stand in awe of the vast beauty of this world we live on.<br /><br />We bought the DVD set and gave it to our son in honor of his eighth birthday. His birthday party was a few hours ago. Toys all forgotten, the family is still gathered around the television, exclaiming over the swift and deadly beauty of a great white shark attack, mourning for the baby elephant lost in a dust storm in an African desert, and getting a sense of the fundamental interconnectedness of all things as David Attenborough describes how the sun heats the sea and forms clouds that sweep inland and bring fresh water and therefore life to the whole earth.<br /><br />It is a nature documentary, so be prepared for some scenes of live or recently live things being eaten, and also for a little eco-preaching, but the focus of the film is really the wonder of it all. Watching these programs is truly mind expanding. I am deeply grateful to the filmmakers who shared with the world these amazing things that otherwise we would never see. Every minute brings a \\"Wow, I never knew that!\\" or \\"Wow, did you see that?\\"<br /><br />These DVD's are going to be some of the most watched in our collection. I recommend them to everyone.
B000UD08HW|4.0|I bought this since i seen this concert in California and wanted to relive the experience. Now why did they rush it to blu ray and only make it 1080I resolution. I could have waited a few more months to have it in 1080P. Blu ray dropped the ball on this by not listing the rsolution and only saying master in high def. On all dark areas you see the limitations of the 1080I stick out. I could have bought the standard dvd and let my receiver and player up convert to 1080p and had a better picture. Sure with the standard dvd you dont get Trur Hd audio, but does the short comings in Video quality affect the overall show>> YES<<<! Now if I dont really watch it and do something else and look up from time to time its 5 stars for sure. Audio is unreal in True Hd, more than I can ask for! But once again the rush to the market approach has killed the video conversion. Shame on Blu ray and Gilmore for letting this happen. Is it still worth buying... YES.. But be warn video quality is a true disappointment that one cant Ignore!!!
B0001932ZA|3.0|Set in a dystopian future where the United States is under a totalitarian regime, THE RUNNING MAN stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ben Richards.  The government has taken control of all forms of entertainment.  The masses are forced fed a media diet of violent reality shows not at all unlike the gladiatorial combat and arena pit patches of ancient Rome.  Richards works for the government as a police officer, but after refusing to shoot a group of unharmed civilians participating in a food riot, he is restrained, arrested and sent to prison.  A year and a half later Richards and two fellow inmates, Weiss (Marvin McIntyre) and Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) escape from prison.  Richards tries to escape the country with Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonso), a woman who is now living in his brother's old apartment, but is caught.  Instead of being executed, Richards is given the option to compete in the most popular television show in the country:  \\"The Running Man.\\"  Of course, the odds are against Richard being able to survive, but if he is able to beat the Stalkers and outlast the hunt, he'll be granted a full pardon.<br /><br />THE RUNNING MAN is loosely based upon the novel of the same name written by Stephen King.  When I say loosely, I mean only Ben Richards name and the concept of a television show called \\"The Running Man\\" are the same.  Everything else is different.  The story that King wrote is about a common man swallowing his pride in an attempt to save his family, but becoming a national hero and taking down an oppressive government at the same time.  King's story is far richer than anything in the movie and has a grand finale (it will probably never be re-made since 9/11).<br /><br />The movie basically is a cheap and cheesy action filmed that was turned into a star driven picture for Arnold.  The very basic idea of the original story remains the same, but that's about it. As for action pictures go, there's a great deal of footage of Arnold running around and throwing dummies around, but that's about it until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Granted THE RUNNING MAN does attempt to deliver a couple of big messages, such as warning about the government's invasion of privacy and the dulling effect television can have upon the masses.  Yet, these issues are done much better in many other movies, i.e. THE TRUMAN SHOW, EDtv, MINORITY REPORT, THX-1138, etc.  Perhaps for me the best part is seeing Richard Dawson playing a sadistic version of himself.<br /><br />Overall, THE RUNNING MAN isn't a great picture and is a horrible adaptation of a Stephen King work, but it is about average for an 80s action movie.  If you're a fan of Schwarzenegger then it's a much-see movie, otherwise it's a fun film to blow some time away with on a rainy weekend.<br /><br />The DVD includes a couple of commentaries, \\"meet the stalkers\\" feature about those specific characters in the movie, a short documentary entitled \\"Lockdown on Main Street\\" about privacy issues in the U.S. after 9/11, and another short documentary called \\"Game Theory\\" about the rise of reality tv as a popular form of programming.  I found \\"Lockdown on Main Street\\" to be a little too biased and focused too much on The Patriot Act.  However, being a huge fan of SURVIVOR and THE AMAZING RACE, I enjoyed \\"Game Theory\\".nd, but that's about it until the last fifteen minutes of the movie.

B00007KQA3|4.0|I thankfully was able to rent this minor classic from the library, but why is it out of print? Seems so inexplicably bizarre. I have been checking frequently for the past year or so, and still, you can't get it used for less than $85 and new will cost you $170! You would think that they would keep a popular classic like this in stock, if for no other reason than their bottomline! And what of this film's historical significance? It was the late great Richard Burton's final role onscreen.<br />Obviously, it is the message contained therein which these cowardly tyrants are afraid of.<br />Get this out to the public Amazon!!
B000V9KFLY|5.0|I absolutely love this new collector's edition! Every real fan would certainly want to buy a copy! The concert is simply amazing! I always wanted to have it on DVD! I also think it's a great Christmas present for everyone, not only Celine's fans! Great Christmas music!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It came before the time said   so i was happy to receive it fast
B000RG1FMO|5.0|As someone who is into metal and punk, I never gave a s*** about rap music. Everyone talking about how rich they are, omg look at dat hoe rite dere she must be worth da millionz i will make in da bizzness. Yeah, who the f*** cares about how rich you are?<br /><br />I also can NOT go to school/the mall/the airport/etc. without seeing guys dressed with needlessly baggy jeans down to their ankles, and everytime I see that, I want to beat the living s*** out of them.<br /><br />So cut back to 2005. I am in HMV looking for some Pink Floyd, and I hear \\"Gold Digger\\" playing through their system. I remember laughing at some of the hilarious lyrics, and I go \\"This is great!!!! Who is this?\\" I her it's Kanye West, so I bought the album with it and another album, and I listened to the album so many times.<br /><br />So cut back to summer of 2007. I am flipping by the channels and the video for \\"Stronger\\" comes on Much Music. I liked it. So the album comes out, and I buy it. I hear the album and I am not able to turn it off at all (except for that awful track with T-Pain....and the even worse one with Lil Wayne, who I can NEVER forgive for sampling my fave band Iron Maiden). Funny lyrics, catchy beats make it a great album.<br /><br />Kanye is the ONLY rap I listen to and enjoy. 90% of the music I listen to is Rock, but Kanye has a place on my iPod too.<br /><br />Some of THE awesome songs include:<br /><br />Stronger<br />Good Morning<br />Champion<br />Can't Tell Me Nothing<br />Bittersweet Poetry<br /><br />Anyways, this is a great album, buy it!
031286504X|4.0|Awesome read that kept me curious throughout. I was surprised that the book also contains a collection of around 10 novella/short stories by the author after the main book. A Dark story that will stick with you.
B000UR9T7I|2.0|I LOVE the Spider Man first two movies, but I am sorry to report that this isn't very good. And here's why:<br /><br />1. Peter in this movie was not very likeable. He is totally emo, and way predatory when he is in touch with his dark side.<br /><br />2. More than half the movie is WAY too depressing. WTF is with MJ being a total bitch and breaking up with Peter, Peter being depressed for more than half the movie, Aunt May's boring relationship adivce, Peter being consumed by his so-called \\"Dark Side\\", and everything being grey??????? Sorry, but that doesn't help the movie. And it doesn't fit in with Spider Man.<br /><br />3. WAY too many characters, most of which are under-characterized and unbelieveable; Venom is pretty much non-existent until the final fight, Eddie Brock has NO place whatsoever, and Sandman is whiny and emo for basically the whole movie.<br /><br />4. The Director is trying to cram way too many things into the movie; way too many charactors, too litle time. there aren't enough fight scenes and when there are, they are lame and only last for practically 1 minute. The reason that the other movies were good was because whilst explaining itself, they still cut the BS and got straight to the action.<br /><br />5. The Fight scenes are lame and totally forgettable, the special effects are awful and yet cartoony, I.E. When the building is almost destroyed.<br /><br />6. WAAAAAAAAY too long!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall this was way dissapointing, and as soon as you see the Jazz club scene, you know what else to expect...<br /><br />This is not a good movie folks, sorry.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Love him or hate him, there is no other director like David Lynch.  True, his films are not for everyone and so reviewing or recommending his work is always a difficult process.  If you've seen, and appreciated, his previous movies then you will surely love \\"Inland Empire\\", Lynch's most daring, creative and challenging work to date.  If not, than this film is probably not for you.    As other reviewers have noted, the plot of this movie revolves around an actress (Laura Dern) who's life becomes intertwined with a character she's playing.  Of course, it sounds a little gimicky, but Dern's transition from one reality to another is pulled off with eerie perfection.  Perhaps less narrative than some of his previous films, Lynch develops atmosphere, tone and mood to create a three hour nightmare of loosely connected scenes and images - for example, the frequent shots of giant rabbits in a bizarre, sit-com-like tableaux seem to have little to do with Dern and the rest of the film.  Pulled back and forth between time and place, the audience is left disoriented and looking for answers until the final scene.  Whether you love it or hate it, you will never see another movie like \\"Inland Empire\\".
B0000027D5|5.0|I bought the 3xlp set used (which is why I love Amazon) around the late 80's.  Lifelong Santana fan and jazz fan.  The perfect mix.  Really, a special album.  The lp is better for one reason only, its size.  The cd is better cuz there's no cracks and pops that vinyl lps inevitably get.  The music is definitely not the lst 3 Santana albums but it's also none of that middle of the road fallow period music they did say 87 to 97.  This stuff also transscends the Santana/McLaughlin material which can get too Indian flavored for most of us.  Instead, this album comes hot on the heals of the first 3 lps (Santana, Abraxas, Santana III) and really is the only place you find a perfect blend of some of that sound mixed seamlessly with a new jazzier sound that he/they never again really captured.  As close as Santana got was Moonflower and Canavansari, both noble albums but I think the difference here is this is live and on those other two albums being in the studio flattened the sound a bit, though there's still music on both that I love it's not as consistent as this album and there's something about Santana's rapport with the audience that adds a sweetness.  Sure, yer gonna be disappointed if yer expecting more of the lst 3 albums.  If you veer into jazz and love Santana at their best, you'll undoubtedly love this album.  It was, indeed, a holy grail for Santana lovers back in the 70's and 80's.  There's a reason.  [...])
0143038419|3.0|There are moments when I really liked this book and moments when I thought it was so boring that I would have put it down if I wasn't leading a book club discussion on it's contents.    Eat, Pray, Love is split into three obvious sections- the author eats in Italy, prays in India and (you guessed it) loves in Indonesia.    Italy and Indonesia are the sections I consider worth reading. India was boring! I found the author to be witty and egocentric. The novel focuses almost entirely on her self degrading thoughts, which in the section title Pray in India, become overwhelming and boring! In the other two sections however the author is able to balance wit and plot with her egocentricity.    I wouldn't read this book again. I would reccomend this book to a friend who might be in the midst of some depressing moment in life, such as a divorce, like the author.
B00005K3OT|5.0|One of our family's favorite films.  It's got it all, Johnny Depp never sexier, a splendid story, a lovely setting and plenty of amazing chocolat.  Beautiful European village, exotic tale, and one of the finest incidents on film of temptation and indulgence with chocolate ever.  There's a variety of story lines all woven together smoothly even with back tracking to explain the nomadic lifestyle of the mother and daughter.  On top of that, an intense story of marriage and how to do it right and do it wrong and the tales of healing and changing that wistfully flows from the magic of an ancient people.  Just a wonderful tale.<br /><br />We've watched this again and are glad we own it.  Makes me wonder if this director has any other magical films.  A moral to the story and everything.  Extremely well done.  Buy it.  I would imagine almost every gal would swoon over Mr. Depp.  And it's not strictly a chick flick at all.  Something for everyone, say for ages 10 and up.
0812550757|5.0|I wouldn't yet consider myself a knowledgeable source when it comes to science-fiction classics, but it's obvious why this is one of them.    [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] was a great book - also a classic - but it was slightly more visceral in order to promote character development.  After all, only a couple of characters, including Ender, carry over into Speaker for the Dead.    Card's sense of pacing in this book is phenomenal, changing your perceptions every few steps to keep you intrigued.  I found myself wonderfully curious all the way up to the end when most everything is revealed.  Reading the end of Speaker was both exciting and depressing, because I really didn't want it to end.    I think the book's five stars are fully deserved.
0385733577|5.0|For those that are Harry Potter fans, this is a must read.  The adventure, not completed in this first book, leaves the readers impatiently waiting for the sequel.  Michael Scott writes in both a character driven and a plot driven method that allows you to get to know the characters while at the same time, enjoying their adventures. Scott writes in a manner that appropriately allows a younger audience to enjoy this story as well as an older audience.

B000000XB9|5.0|Many people don't know that your illustrious Seer was born on the bayou. Totally true story. I am the 7th son born on the 7th month on the 7th day at the 7th hour. My Metamama cried when I was born \\"This one will be a hellraiser-Oh Lordy!\\". But, as all my dedicated fans know by now- she was wrong. I am a heaven-raiser- and hopefully a good one at that. Still- it took alot of side-stepping to get out of that swamp to become the Seer that you all know and love today. Being reflective takes hard work- and ambition. Sort of like Creedence - my home town boys. At least my Metamama liked them. Why shouldn't she? They weren't related. :)<br />What I really loved about Creedence is that they defied the conventions of their time. While others tended towards studio production lucidity - Creedence decided to keep it raw and real. There is no mystery to the sound here. It is straight ahead swamp rock-blues power packed into mostly a 3 minute window. How they were able to do this with so much economy is discussed - even today- amongst erudite Seer circles. But, they did it and, as simple as it was, it works- song after song after song. Everyone of these songs is memorable - and competent. Are they the greatest musicians that ever lived? No. But did they know how to do things right for them? Definitely. And I think that is why, in large part, that they created the legacy that they did.<br />You can see the progression in these tunes. Not in leaps and bounds - but subtle as you proceed. \\"Suzie Q\\" and \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" are rough takes - but it is that undeniable quality that propels these songs to swamp magic. They get a little better as we go along in production - but not by much. Why spoil the formula? \\"Proud Mary\\" with that simple strumming riff. It's so elementary but so alluring. And I don't believe Creedence ever copied from another song. Each one was totally original by itself. You could have a song with a blistering, intense lead like \\"Travelin' Band\\" and then one with a slow, bluesy feel like in \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\". Everything here borrows from different genres - blues, country, southern streetcorner sounds, sweeping bayou intonations, rock and roll intensity. It is the feel of the songs that is so real. They do not compromise and include alien instruments. No. This c.d. is very real and this band is what I'd like to hear when I go down to the local bar for a beer. Uncomplicated and great!<br />I could give you a run-down of all the songs included here. But it would prove nothing. If you haven't heard these songs somehow since they were released then someone in your life has been negligent. Perhaps you! And, if so, emergency therapy is needed. I could do it - but be forewarned- a small charge will be excised. Get this. Creedence - a legendary pure American rock band. So classic- and so good to hear after all the overly-produced stuff from the last 30-40 years.<br />Gotta go. I hear the phone ringing and it's probably Metamama calling to wish her son happy holidays. That, and to chide me, yet again, for not joining Creedence way back then when they asked me. With parents there just are some things they never let you forget. Oh well.....<br /><br />And I wonder, still I wonder - Who'll stop the Metamorpho?bluesy feel like in \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\".

B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this video on the recommendation of a friend, and I will never be sorry for taking that advice. It was simply that good.    At a run time of over five hours, I expected that there would be some slow spots, but there were none. From beginning to end, this film was completely engrossing. Nor does it suffer from once having been a televised mini-series. The breaks between episodes and between commercial interruptions are visible, but they are integrated masterfully into the continuous work.    The screenplay is delightfully faithful to Austen. If there were any lines of dialogue omitted, I did not miss them. The characterisation is established early on, and is portrayed consistently throughout the film.     The locations are perfect. Longbourne is stately, of course, but the contrast between it and the more luxurious estates, Netherfield Park, Pemberley, Rosings Park, is profound. The furniture and set-dressing, too, is appropriate for the time period and the affluence of the owner. The attention to detail is outstanding.    The casting was inspired. Colin Firth, while he might not possess classic male beauty, simply radiates charisma. Jennifer Ehle is everything that Eliza Bennet, a \\"local beauty\\" could be expected to be, and possesses the animation to make the viewer believe that she is every bit the clever, independant woman she is supposed to be. Crispin Bonham-Carter as the amiable, handsome, and somewhat vapid Mr Bingley was also a good pick. Allison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow were likewise well cast. There could have been no better choices for Caroline Bingley and Mr Collins than Anne Chancellor and David Bamber. Julia Sawalha might have been a bit old for the 15 year old Lydia Bennet, but her playful, unaffected manner make it easy to overlook that. Susannah Harker and Adrian Lukis were the only characters that did not fit, to my eye. Harker's acting saves her, as she does a wonderful job portraying the sweet-natured, serene-countenanced Jane Bennet, but neither is quite as handsome as they are reputed to be.    The acting throughout was so good that I could not say who did the best job.     The directing is where this really shines, though. The tendency with Austen is to have too heavy a hand. Austen is witty and funny, but she is subtle. Simon Langton could not have done a better job preserving everything that makes Jane Austen such a pleasure to read. He keeps the action moving forward, no mean feat over such a lengthy film, but allows Austen's own wit and humor to shine through.    The soundtrack fits the piece perfectly. I especially enjoyed how Melvyn Tan's piano skills appeared to vary, depending on the performer actually sitting in front of the instrument. Music held a prominent place in the novel, and in the film, it almost had the place of another actor, rather than mere accompaniment. It was never a distraction, as it was in the 1986 BBC Northanger Abbey, nor did it overpower the scene, as it did in the 1995 BBC Persuasion. Instead, it subtly supported the action on the screen.     The costumes, too were faithful and well done, but I did notice a few things that I might have wished were different. Jennifer Ehle does not have the right complexion for earth tones, and I felt that her beige frocks and tan spencers washed her out terribly. Also, Darcy is the only young man who wears dark trousers, besides Mr Collins, the clergyman. Every once in a while, he's put in a pair of buff or grey ones, but for the most part, they're all black. Most of the other male characters wear pale-colored trousers with formal attire. Yes, this really is all I found to complain about, which should say something.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|We've come to expect excellence from David Gilmour, and this 2 dvd set delivers in spades. Disc 1 is packed with material from his Royal Albert Hall show, further cementing Dave's reputation as a god of the Stratocaster. He takes turns on lap steel, Hawaiian guitar, saxophone, and something that looks like a cross between a banjo and a cooking pot. In Floydian tradition, the light show is spectacular, and it's so wonderful that he shares the spotlight with Pink keyboardist Richard Wright. For this old Floyd fan, inclusion of a magnificent \\"Echoes\\" and Gilmour's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" really hit the spot. Guest appearances from David Bowie (\\"Arnold Layne\\") and Crosby & Nash are icing on the cake.  Disc two continues with a host of stuff too numerous to mention, including out-takes from the concert, another 5 song mini concert, a great video diary of his European tour, the making of \\"On An Island\\", two videos, and the previously- available-only-as-a-bonus-track \\"Island Jam\\", and more. A fantastic release.
B000VR824S|5.0|Watched the whole thing last night. Over 4 hours long and I wish they could have added another 2 DVD's. The actual concert lasted 12 hours. Winwood & Clapton back togather! Hello Blind Faith - perfect.       Wide screen, great audio and video - I sure like modern tech!    The concert starts out at pretty mello and picks up steam & kicks some serious ass on the second DVD. Jazz, Blues, Country & Rock. It's all there, by a bunch of great peeps. I rate Crossroads 2007 as high as David Gilmour's new DVD. Two of the best in 2007.    I just wish as many others have complained, Jeff Beck's entire set should have been included on the DVD.    What a set list.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is one of those musicals that will stand the test of time, never growing stale, never becoming dated.  The lyrics are funny, poignant and thoughtful; often all three at once.  The music is well written, lyrical and powerful without overshadowing the meaning of the words. The singing is excellent and the actors/actresses vocal nuances clearly portrays their character's emotional state.  The sound quality is clear and immediate.  In other words, this is probably as perfect a sound recording as you will ever find!

The feeling in all the tracks is so real that you can't listen to it without getting into it. This album will always remain their masterpiece.  What I heard about this album is that all the songs are written in 2 or 3 weeks after the Cavanagh brothers' mother's death...So sad...

B000U7169M|2.0|This is quite a mish-mash.  First there seems to be an evil young girl, played by AnnaSophia Robb, who is causing Biblical plagues in a small Louisiana parish.  Then it appears that she is an angel and that everyone else in the town is worshipping Satan. She finally destroys them all--or God does; it's hard to say for sure.  Then she implies to her rescuer, played by Hilary Swank, that the baby Swank is carrying is evil and the spawn of Satan...and that they both have to take care of the little devil.    Huh?  This movie just couldn't make up its mind.  Is it supposed to be a story of faith or devil worship or what?  You tell me.  Swank and Robb have both done far better work than this.

B000021Y77|5.0|[[ASIN:B000021Y77 Run Lola Run]]  Tremondous film.Indian film-maker,Mani Ratnam claims his film,'Aayudha Ezhuthu' was inspired by this film. Kurosawa's Acclaimed 'Rushmon' is the original inspiration for both. Franka Potente gives a stunning performance. You should watch the film in German with English subtitles. Never watch dubbed versions.It's Rivetting. Recent Hollywood pulp,'One Night at McCools' starring Liv Tyler, John Goodman etc. is a lousy imitation. Though filmed on a shoe-string budget,the film teaches  'aspiring directors', particularly from India, how to create a CLASSIC. Though Franka Potente is now famous in her own right in Hollywood, this is one film of hers, which should NOT be MISSED!

0452282152|4.0|Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" (once referred to as \\"Girl With a Turban\\" or \\"Young Girl\\" and now also referred to as \\"The Mona Lisa of the North\\"), seems ready made for speculative fiction. In the case of this work, speculation may in fact be all that we have. The origin and history of the painting remain shrouded in mystery. Only a signature, revealed after a 19th century cleaning, ties the painting to the Dutch Master. Historical records and provenance become very unclear before 1881. Scholars do know that it was purchased for almost nothing in that same year at auction. Before that, it might be one of the items mentioned in Vermeer's 1676 death inventory, listed as \\"2 tronies painted in turkish fashion.\\" As such, this enigmatic portrait only gained its reputation, and current name, in the twentieth century. At the epicenter of its mystique sits that anonymous but emotionally charged face. Someone was the model for Vermeer's masterpiece. No records remain. And that provides the jumping off point for fiction.<br /><br />This book, with no pretensions to historical accuracy whatsoever (the word \\"a novel\\" are emblazoned across the cover), makes Griet, a poor maid trapped by 17th century societal circumstances, the subject of Vermeer's masterpiece. Griet's father has lost his sight and his trade in the equivalent of an industrial accident (a kiln exploded). This forces the family to \\"sell\\" their daughter into paid domestic servitude. The waifish seventeen year old Protestant then enters the Catholic world of the famous Vermeer family. She enters a house imploding with internal politics and social hierarchy. Even the children and grandparents are in on it, and Griet proves a quick study of the de facto house laws. Though the painter himself appears shadowy, distant, and wraith like at first, he takes Griet under his wing as his unofficial assistant. She mixes and buys paint for him. She even makes an \\"improvement\\" in one of his paintings. He shows her the wonder of the camera obscura. Through him she gains self-respect and confidence in herself. The famous painter helps her grow. None of this happen withouts intrigue, of course. This is a novel. As Griet becomes more involved with the master of the house, the children plot against her and the matriarch, Catharina, grows suspicious. Griet also grows rather fond, too fond, of her master. He seems to have reciprocal feelings. If that weren't enough, the plague hits Griet's neighborhood and her social standing as a woman interferes with her ability to find out the condition of her parents and sister. Griet also possesses beauty. She attracts the butcher's son, Pieter. More ominously, Vermeer's main patron, Pieter van Ruijven, takes a liking to the developing maid. He wants Vermeer to paint her. Other girls in this situation have ended up in dire circumstances (i.e., pregnant). Vermeer intervenes, but agrees to paint Griet nonetheless. The famous portrait is born. His wife finds out and flies into a rage before trying to destroy the painting. The main affront revolves around the pearl earrings. How could he have allowed a maid to wear them? Griet finds herself out of a job standing at the 8-pointed star that serves as the novel's main metaphor of human action. She has some freedom after all. Each point represents a future: a return to her parents; a search for her fugitive brother; betrothal to the butcher; aimless meandering. Griet makes a smart choice. Ten years later, the Vermeer family reappears in her new life with a surprising request from the master painter himself.<br /><br />\\"Girl With a Peal Earring\\" explores the coming of age of a 17th century \\"common\\" Dutch woman. Throughout, Griet remains a tool to the opaque men that come and go, control her, attempt intimacy with her, and ultimately buy and sell her. Even after she marries her husband jokes about \\"the price of a maid.\\" Griet forever resolves this issue, with a dash of poetic justice, on the novel's final page. And though the story might come across as a too-familiar tale of \\"evil patriarchy,\\" Griet nonetheless makes real choices concerning her destiny. If anything, the narrative attempts to empower the lives of women who found themselves in such a stringent society but nonetheless acted. They may seem powerless to us now, but these actions carried implications for themselves and for others. In essence, they weren't completely powerless. As the story unfolds, Griet evolves from a nervous waif into an adult with awareness of her sensuality and a sense of her power within the confines of society. It's no coincidence that she turns 18 at a crucial point in the story. Today we consider that age the gateway to adulthood. The fictional drama of Griet's few years in the Vermeer household leave us to reflect on fate, our place in society, and the implications of our actions. Some things never change.final page.

0553582038|1.0|The decision to split the trilogy and make it 3a and 3b was certainly the worst I have ever seen. The story plot is not advancing at the same speed than 1 and 2 and the book as it is right now is just boring. Even worse, although Martin promised to publish 3b soon after the 3a release, he is not even close to finishing up.  This must be a debacle from the editor/publisher point of view, whoever did not convince him to make it a straight trilogy had more dollar signs in his eyes than the reader in mind. I will certainly not buy the next book. I am deeply dissapointed that such a great storyline and interesting characters are dying this way.....
B00011RPB0|2.0|First time around, I thought this picture was good and remember recommending it to friends. On second watch, I found the whole thing an incredible bore. True, there are good points, some jokes, and Johansson is photogenic. The direction is competent, the setting is arresting and seldom used, so all the power to Coppola, but as cool as Murray is supposed to be, I thought his antics tiresome. The inability of Japanese to speak English is funny once, maybe twice, but at a certain point, maybe the third or fourth time, I began to think it was boring and then offensive. The acting is good and the story isn't bad. We understand the boredom and isolation they are going through, we sympathize, I think, because the set up is well-done. She's been left alone by an unloving husband; he's not missed at home and feels unwanted and unneeded. Still, the Japan setting while it works gets old fast because there are no insights, no perceptive observations, really nothing. It is merely an exploited backdrop to a narcissist's breakdown. Everything gets old fast, because as good as the acting is, it cannot hide the absence of a story.  Japan has been the next great thing now for thirty years. It is time for someone daring to really look at the society and expose it for what it is, instead of presenting it once again as a gag.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|I believe in the global warming, first of all. However, that's a very complex matter. The climatology is a young science with a huge ammount of data that needs better tools to be processed, like supercomputers not yet built. Global warming effects are not so predictable as Al Gore tells in this film, ignoring how scientific data must be presented. The graphical data by the end of the film with increasing temperatures are gross fake. And above all, the film is egocentric on Mr.Gore, who's is not a SCIENTIST.  Good point if you start thinking on man affecting the enviroment in an uncontrollable way. But bad scientific data and too personal view of the matter. I'd like to see a BBC doc on the subject, with David Attenborough or just no one; sure can be better than this egocentric and simplistic view of an important matter.
B000FGG60W|4.0|Overall, I like the movie, but I have to remove one star, because of a few things that I thought were unrealistic.  The main character, played by Radha Mitchell, went into a hole to search for a guy that obviously got mawled by some unknown creatures.  After almost getting killed, too, she escapes out of the hole, exclaiming, \\"That was a stupid thing to do!\\" or something like that. No kidding!  I just hate when characters do really dumb things.  Other than that, the picture and sound quality is excellent in HD, and the story line is interesting.  I won't give too much away.  I give it a 4.

B000AGTPUU|1.0|I just watched this with my kids last night.  I'm sorry, but I just can't square this Santa and North Pole with a standard like \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer.\\"  That place was full of love and humor, forgiveness and humility.  This Polar Express version is dark, authoritarian, and punative.  I also can't believe it earned a \\"G\\" rating with so much excessive danger and stressful suspense (train on the ice, Christmas star nearly killing an elf, etc) - my three-year old got scared and had to turn her head six times!  How awful!  (She kept coming back because her 6-year old brother was still watching.)    In \\"Polar Express\\" the conductor, Santa and the elves are humorless and of a \\"law and order\\" mentality that is prim and schoolmarmish - this is Christmas Eve, guys!  Loosen up!  And what is with Santa, anyway?  He clearly has a messianic complex that is fed by the uniformed cheers of thousands of sycophantic elves at the Nazi rally - er, midnight takeoff of the sleigh - when he makes his appearance.  And when Santa confronts the kid who picks up the lost reindeer bell, why so impolite?  Here he picks up the bell and then Santa appears out of nowhere and towers over him, the kid turns around and is obviously scared - c'mon, it's SANTA, people! - and what does Santa do?  No introductions, or \\"Hello, I'm Santa, what's your name?\\"  He says, \\"What did you say?\\" in a very accusatory manner.  What a jerk!  But then, he runs a Bushian North Pole that has secret spy monitors on every kid alive, conveniently priming kids for a future with no privacy.  Imagine Soup Nazi mates with Santa (woah), and you have this guy.    So I give this 1 star because there IS some lip service to the real message of Christmas (what, it's not about just getting stuff?) and the graphics of the train (especially the hot chocolate sequence - that is actually excellent) are good in a Fritz Lang sort of way.  But if you want the spirit of Christmas, for God's sake get another movie.
B00000AFDW|3.0|Just like everyone else, I waited for this album once The Originals decieded to write together. This album was a huge disapointment to me. This sounds like something they wanted to do after Unmasked instead of The Elder. It has some rocking songs on it, but it lacks rock totally. It is mostly filler with a few killers. This is an ego album, all four of them having something to prove to each other once again. You have the main song writers Gene and Paul, then you have the one from Ace and of course there is nothing from Peter. I wasn't expecting a Revenge II but I was expecting something a little more out of them. The songs remind me of a step backwards for Gene and Paul. Same solo stuff from Ace. And of course nothing from Peter. I guess he can't write anything so they threw him a bone just to make him stay.     \\"Psycho Circus\\" keeps you wanting more. KILLER    \\"Within\\" progession, keeps you wanting. KILLER    \\"I Pledge Allegiance...\\" garage band dreams. FILLER    \\"Into The Void\\" couldn't you come up with something better than a song about yourself Ace?. FILLER    \\"We Are One\\" a left over from Gene's first solo album. Or a song that could have been on The Elder. FILLER    \\"You Wanted The Best\\" could you only bring back painful memories for another reason? FILLER    \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" this would have been a good song if it wasn't about being a garage band and trying to make it. FILLER    \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" well Peter found something. Himself singing on an album someone was going to listen to. Is this suppose to be the \\"Beth II\\" song. This is just crap and it's even crapier with his voice. This isn't a FILLER, this is ....(I don't think I could put that on here.)    \\"Dreamin\\" back to the rocking. KILLER    \\"Journey of 1,000 Years\\" this has KILLER written all over it. Just a little problem. This should not have been the last song on the album.     After 18 years of being apart this was the best they could have come up with? The cover is cool with it's 3D look.The inside sleave could have been a little better. More photos, liner notes. I can actually see why they haven't put out another album after this and just kept touring. Who wants to buy crap. I see this in the USED BIN alot and if I didn't want it so badly when it first came out, I would have bought it in a USED BIN also. You complain about people downloading your music all the time, saying they are stealing from you. Stop stealing from us and release something worth while buying, this wasn't it.
B0000041DF|5.0|In the world of classical music, recordings, either live or in the studio, can be the stuff of which legends are made. This has never been more true than of the performance of the Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto by Martha Argerich on this cd. She attacks the solo passages with a passionate intensity unparalleled in any recording of this piece that I have ever heard. This live performance of the Rach 3rd with Riccardo Chailly from 1982 adds to her mystique in much the same way that the Ravel Piano Concerto in G/Rachmaninov Concerto #4 on EMI's Great Recordings of the Century by Michelangeli does for that Italian legend of the 88-with utterly stunning technical prowess that will leave the listener speechless. Coupled with an able performance of the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto, this all-time classic Philips recording of the Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto presents Martha Argerich at her very best, and takes its place among some of the greatest classical recordings ever made. It truly is the stuff of which legends are made.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Both Britney and I were reared in southeast Louisiana, and I am so-o-o-o glad that my homegirl was able to rise above all the criticism that surrounds her every move.  I am referring to the reporting by the so-called NEWS MEDIA, who are always very eager to declare that she is washed up.  But I noticed that this CD made its debut on the Billboard Album Chart at #2, so maybe this will shut their mouths for at least 15 seconds.  But probably not, since they seem to prefer negativity to accuracy most of the time.<br /><br />Anyway, the music.  Brit, instead of apologizing and trying to repair her image, gives us a red-hot dance album that reinforces that image.  &#34;Gimme More&#34; says it all, but she goes on to say more.  &#34;Heaven On Earth&#34;, with its driving euro-disco beat, is a turn-on lyrically and musically.  Ditto for &#34;Get Naked&#34;.  In &#34;Freakshow&#34; she pokes fun at herself and her life, and in &#34;Toy Soldier&#34; she expresses a pretty universal need.  The music of &#34;Ooh Ooh Baby&#34; reminds me of Madonna's &#34;Like It Or Not&#34;, but the lyrics are much more suggestive.  You can hear a little Madonna on other tracks as well, in addition to lots of futuristic electro-pop.  All in all, what more can I say except this is another successful, well-produced Britney Spears album.  I hope that she enjoyed making it, and I hope that she will keep at it.

184195425X|3.0|Aside from being well written and a pretty good adventure story I think the main attribute of this novel is it's existential theme.  After a ship wreck the main character is trapped on a small life boat with a full grown tiger.  Early on Pi assess the futility of his predicament and thinks about just hurling himself overboard.  But he doesn't!  Instead, he struggles each day trying to control what he can, oraganize his activities to minimize danger and potential problems and use his powers of reason to 'keep the tiger at bay'.  All the while knowing that at any moment, in an instant, the tiger could strike and its good night Irene! And isn't that what we all do everyday?  We take all the measures we can to 'secure' ourselves physically, financially, emotionally, etc but in the back of our mind we know it could all come to a halt in an instant.  Ultimately our fate is in the hands (paws ?) of the 'tiger of life'    It reminds me of the scene in John Irving's, The World According To Garp, where his youngest son is afraid of the water because the 'undertoad' might come out of nowhere and drag him into the ocean.  He mistakes the undertow for some mythical beast that can come from nowhere and end his existence.    If we really contemplate just how  precarious our existence is we to might be tempted to hurl ouselves overboard and get it over with. But luckily we are hardwired with some amazing intestinal fortitude that allows us to go on.  And I think Pi's journey is meant to represent that.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|Reading \\"V for Vendetta\\" (the graphic novel) was such an overwhelming experience that one could be forgiven for wishing fervently that a movie adaptation *not* be made. But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.<br /><br />The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes \\"V,\\" a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another \\"November, November, the fifth of the November\\" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.<br /><br />Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.<br /><br />Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. \\"V\\" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as \\"V\\" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.<br /><br />The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short \\"making of\\" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, \\"V for Vendetta\\" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.film's changes occur.

0385339100|4.0|Let me first say that I'm a fan of Grisham's style and skill and I've read most of his books. This book is longer than most of Grisham's books. It is very technical (lot's of law maneuvering) which is positive but it gets slightly long winded toward the very end. It's full of action though quite fantastic. Like most Grisham books, it follows a common formula: Hero in a pickle, Hero works very hard, Hero has a trick up their sleeve, Hero wraps it all up nicely. *Spoiler Alert* Except that in this case the hero was blindsided by a betrayal. I thought it was weak because a.) The betrayal is very foreseeable by the Hero, b.) It didn't make sense for the betrayer to wait until the end of the book to suddenly do their deed. and c.) The Hero was close to the betrayer's family. He could just go to the family and wait it out. There was little foreshadowing, little character development of the betrayer to the goal of the betrayal and an abrupt ending. Overall though, it's a very good read which is why I gave it four stars... perhaps just don't read the very last few pages and make up your own ending... :-)

B000F39M9W|4.0|There is much to admire in this disc. There are a few quibbles too, but foremost this recording stands as an impressive snapshot of a team at the top of their game, a partnership that has set the trend for the new century in presenting live classical music in America. The power-packed repertoire featured here has now become symbolic of the L.A. Philharmonic (and their cutting-edge Disney Hall) thanks to Esa-Pekka Salonen's unstinting artistic leadership, and their 20th-century chops have as a result become honed to perfection. The Rite has become the Phil's virtual calling card since the move, and the polish and confidence they play with show how comfortable they feel in this music, that they identify with these pieces now as their core repertory.    I agree a bit with T.E. Gossard's review below - in this Rite the interpretation does present the composition in an alternative, still valid, way. If you're familiar with some of Salonen's other work, it won't surprise that he serves up kinetic, full-bodied, and modern Le Sacre. But instead of primal wantonness, we have a compelling argument for elegant, sleek seduction, with a hypnotic Rondes Printanieres and singularly minded Danse Sacrale as cases in point. As far as the use of the 1947 revision, we know this group can play the spots off any page put in front of them, and rather than for difficulty considerations, I would think Salonen as a composer and highly skilled orchestrator himself chose this version because of preference, because the cleaner textures better serve the interpretation he wanted to present. And in this context, the choice makes a lot of sense. Salonen and L.A. have done more exciting, risk-taking Le Sacre together (look up their excellent Disney Hall inaugural video online), but this exceedingly well-played, fluid, and dynamic reading makes a fine contemporary addition to the body of classic recordings out there.    The L.A. Philharmonic's enormous precision, control, and lean, muscular, organicsound are displayed beautifully in their performances of the other two pieces on the disc - the immensely fun original version of Night on Bald Mountain, and the concert suite from Bartok's provocative Miraculous Mandarin ballet. The original Bald Mountain is thrilling here (and shows how fantastically creative and ahead of his time Mussorgsky really was), and is a must-hear if you only know the piece through \\"Fantasia\\" - it is not the same piece by any stretch. The Bartok gets the best performance of the disc for me - this team is absolutely top-shelf in repertoire from the early 20th-century to the present. They are propulsive, detailed, and vivacious here, with the highlights being incredible wind soloists and beautiful contrasts between the spiky and lyrical lines Bartok juxtaposes.    A couple of quibbles, however: one being the sound. While the space is vividly realized in SACD format, the recording balance is a problem in this ultra-responsive environment - extreme highs and lows result in a shrieking piccolo and a bass drum akin to a bomb dropping, while the mids lose some punch. DG has done far better on the recent LA Phil iTunes releases, but here they were still in the learning curve. Another quibble is the program order. I wish the Bartok had been last. Not only would it have put the pieces in chronological order, which shows a fascinating progression in the writing, but the Bartok performance is so outstanding and the piece so unusual compositionally, the familiar Le Sacre seems almost tame by comparison!    There was a lot of hype around this disc, especially due to the promises of the hall, perhaps resulting in extra-high expectations. But if excessive, it is certainly the well-deserved celebration of the end of a long (20-year long!) journey for the Philharmonic towards their new home and a new direction, which constitutes the lasting legacy Esa-Pekka Salonen will leave when he steps down. I only hope that we'll get one more Disney Hall SACD from them before he hands over the reins to Dudamel...perhaps the conductor's own phenomenal new Piano Concerto? DG - our collective fingers are crossed.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd's historic reunion tour in 1994(minus Roger Waters)is captured with a show that includes The Dark Side of the Moon album performed in it's entirety along with classic cuts from their whole catalog of albums. Pulse is everything a concert should be with songs that provoke deep thought and music to subduce any mood in the mesmeric form only Pink Floyd can accomplish, and all enhanced by backing vocalists, psychedelic images, and amazing light displays. Pink Floyd's Pulse is a show above all others. Magnificent. Electrifying. Tranquilizing. Spectacular.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|After the incredible Led Zeppelin DVD I was hoping for another gem from Jimmy Page and Co. However this new \\"improved\\" soundtrack has some glaring faults! For all the huge Zep fans who have listened to and watched TSRTS will notice that the movie has a couple of bad edits involving the sound. On the old album these bad edits are not present making the music that much better. However on the new expanded CD set the bad edits from the film are now included on the CDs!!! The worst example is the funk riff in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" prior to the theremin solo. It has been completely chopped up thus destroying the fluency of the segue Jimmy Page employs as he moves to the next passage of the extended songs. WHY WOULD HE ALLOW THIS!?! Jimmy Page has always given us top-notch production but this error is simply inexcusable. I've been waiting for this cd to come out for months only to be disappointed by someone I thought would never disappoint me!!! There are also several instances where Robert Plant's voice has been over-dubbed to the existing vocal to create some type of echo effect I guess; but it is clear that it is an overdub and not simply a vocal effect used live. The extra tracks are great but I just can't believe Jimmy Page has drop the ball like this with so many bad edits most obvious in the guitar passages and vocal echoes. I've never before been disappointed by Led Zeppelin! This Sucks!
0312360266|3.0|I know it's not fair to compare one book with another even if it's on the same subject matter. However, I fell in love with Stephenie Meyer's books Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. Although Marked has great new ideas on different descriptions of vampires (or should i say, \\"vampyres,\\" the main character seemed immature and shallow. Yes, sarcasm is nice, and she used a lot of it, but some of the things she'd say just seemed retarded, or more information than I really needed. Also, her friends seemed totally stereotypical. However, I gave this book 3 stars because I still wanted to read to the end, it still had an interesting plot, and maybe teenagers younger than myself will enjoy Zoey's ridiculous remarks more than I could.

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|As a movie reviewer and entertainment reporter, I received this CD at the press junket for the biopic, I'm Not There. It's the best swag I've gotten in years. I'm not a huge Dylan fan (I like his well-known hits, though), but these covers really open up a whole new frontier. Along with The White Stripes' \\"Icky Thump\\" and Tim Armstrong's \\"Poet's Life\\" this is by far one of the best CDs of the year.
0765357151|2.0|I was under the impression that this was a novel. The book doesn't let on that it was a compilation of short stories. So, when I reached the end of the Short Story half way through the book \\"I AM LEGEND\\" I felt disillusioned, if not tricked.<br /><br />The story was interesting but not very moving. There were inconsistencies as well. The main character visits the  mausoleum where the body of his baby girl is being held, later in the story he mentions that the body was taken from his arms and burned with a multitude of others. (What really happened?)<br /><br />In any case, I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. I hope the movie is better.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was born in 1964, so was not of concert going age during the Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, or even Animals Tours.   However, I worshipped Pink Floyd, and would play their albums until the grooves were worn to nothing.  Like most teens growing up in the 1970s, Dark Side was my all time favorites, and was especially enjoyed with headphone while, um, let's just say enjoying certain libations not approved by Nancy Reagan.      By the time I got to see Pink Floyd live, it was after Roger Waters had left, and a nasty lawsuit between him and the remaining members was over, leaving Gilmour and the others with the right to continue under the same name.  The excitement of going to the show was somewhat less than it would have been had the group been unchanged.  I was always one of those who thought that Roger was Pink Floyd....and I could not have been more wrong.  The \\"Momentary Lapse\\" album was outstanding, as was the concert at Tampa Stadium in the mid 1980s.    While Roger's contribution to the group can not be overstated (He wrote almost all of their stuff, including all of Dark Side), he is simply, and unfortunately, not needed at all for the PERFORMANCE of their music.  Almost all of the vocals on Dark Side come from one of the greatest guitarists of all time, David Gilmour (save Brain Damage, which actually sounds just as good with Gilmour singing).  If their were a trial on whether Pink Floyd can perform without Roger at the same level, then this DVD, PULSE, would be Exhinbit 1.  In fact, it would be the whole trial, and the case would be closed.  Pulse was performed in London in 1994, and David, Nick, and Richard are at the very top of their game.  Sure, by now David is in his 50s, and may not have quite the voice he did in his 20s, but you would never know it.      The production of this concert is \\"insane good.\\"  One of my favorite parts of the DVD is the end of side one, when they perform \\"One of These Days,\\" featuring David Gilmour haunting riff on the lap slide guitar.  This pre-Dark Side song, which was released as the first track on Meddle, would be seemingly difficult to play in concert with all the multitracking they did in studio production, but the concert version is even better.      Side Two of this DVD is worth the purchase price alone.  I mean, \\"Dark Side\\" played in concert, all the way through, without interruption?  WOW.  Pink Floyd was always famous for it's props and light shows, and this concert does not disappoint.  Again, the Director of Photography, Editors, and Production Team do just an incredible job of capturing what is going on during this performance.   The only draw back during Dark Side is no one can match Claire Torrey's vocals on Great Gig, but the back-up singers do an admirable job trying to fill her shoes.  That may be the only song that can never be truly reproduced in concert (and to think that she came into the studio in 1972 during mixing of Dark Side pulling what amounts to a one hour \\"session\\" shift for $50, crying towards the end of her shift, upset at the \\"bad job\\" she had done).    The Curtain Call songs on Pulse were perfectly chosen.  The Band comes back on stage to play a set starting with Wish You Were Here, written at the time in the 70s as a song for Syd Barrett, the original leader of the band who was replaced in the 1960s due to severe mental illness.  One is left to wonder if this was now included as a message to Roger (or, was the acrimony still too fresh from the bitter lawsuit, and perhaps me just wanting to believe they could want to re-unite at some level).   Wish you were Here is then followed by two great songs from The Wall, Comfortably Numb and Run.    This is 5-Stars, and it is not even close.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.  As I started, \\"I almost feel bad for Roger.\\"  I have seen Roger Waters no less than four times in concert, and while he is great, it is his shows, albums and performances that have greatly suffered from his departure.  Sure, he is the genius who wrote almost all the post 1970 stuff for Pink Floyd, including Dark Side and The Wall, but, frankly, his talent is not needed at all to perform these masterpieces.  I mean, I love Roger, but by the time he writes \\"The Final Cut\\" the band was being dragged down by his obsessive predisposition towards dark war-time music.   \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" can only be enjoyed by someone like me, who is a true fanatic, but the album is pretty lame and sounds more or less like an extension to The Final Cut.   While Roger was writing Pros and Cons in yet another attempt to illustrate his angst at a-hole war time leaders, David, Nick and Richard were getting on with their lives, and coming out with \\"Momentary Lapse\\"....pulling off what many thought impossible without Waters:  A Quality Pink Floyd Album true to their heritage.    By the way, you can tell that this concert is recorded in the 1990s, because during \\"Brain Damage,\\" when the song starts \\"The Lunatic is on the Grass\\", the overhead movie shows George Bush, SR standing outside on the grass.  If the concert were more modern, say, 2005, then one has to believe the entire movie would not have been of Sr, but rather...........  well, you decide.

The best second season story, Wyndom Earle, you can get starting at the end of episode 20, and you will certainly want to watch 29, the final episode.

0752852612|4.0|I had problems with this novel.  I couldn't follow all of the complexities of the ultra-complicated, ever-shifting plot of wholesale corruption in a small, industrial Western city (corporate, police, mob, etc.). And it all seemed so familiar, hackneyed.  But then I remembered a couple of things:  That this was so familiar because hundreds of other authors and thousands of other books have tried with varying degrees of success to mimic and further develop Hammett's \\"hard-boiled\\", noirish style in the past 75 or so years.  And also, that perhaps it wasn't necessary to follow the incredibly convoluted plot, or even keep full track of who each of the legion of sleazy characters are, in order to best enjoy the book.  After I made those decisions, the rest of my reading experience was much more pleasurable and rewarding.  In a strange way it reminded me of some the French \\"nouveau romain\\" authors where the style, the words, the way things are expressed, the endless repetition of certain motifs, words, and concepts become the primary or perhaps only true point of the novel. After a while, it became hypnotizing, marvelous, and, for me, laugh-out-loud hilarious, particularly with the \\"Laudinum\\" chapter (and actually, a lot of the second half of the book) beginning to remind me of things like Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a favorite book of mine.  Always very granular and factual, the overload of facts, events, wise cracks, sleaze, and more sleaze and wise cracks becomes like some kind of demented (but amazing) symphony.  I believe I'll remember this one for quite a while -- although I'm not sure I'm ready to jump into another one of his works right now.  I'll save it for later when I've recovered from this one.

B0007TKNII|2.0|Of course, I'm a little prejudiced, since I think the stage musical is problematic.  On the plus side, it's got a rich, tuneful score, but on the negative, I find the lyrics to be often sappy and insipid.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I sat down and watched the film version.<br /><br />To put it in a nutshell, a big issue I have with the whole treatment here is that ALW and Joel Schumacher take Gaston Leroux's penny-dreadful gothicism and filter it through the sensibilities of a Harlequin romance novel.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is, I think, one of the best casting choices in this film.  Her youth makes Christine's gullibility and naivite believable, and her voice is simply superb.  Her performance keeps Christine from seeming too much like a flighty drip.  But Gerard Butler is disastrously miscast as the Phantom, and his Erik has got to be one of the most woefully misconceived characterizations that I've seen in years.  All through the movie we hear about how hideous he is.  Even Christine sings, \\"Distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face.\\"  And yet, when unmasked, we have an extremely handsome man with a small bumpy patch on his face that merely looks like an unpleasant skin condition.  The Phantom's unmasking is supposed to produce shock, horror, and pity...but in this film, the only emotion I felt was the desire to slip him the name of a good dermatologist.  The ball was totally dropped there, folks, and the one of the story's big climaxes was anticlimactic.  (Various wags dubbed Butler \\"The Fashionably Scarred Stud of the Opera\\" which is pretty dead-on...)<br /><br />Unfortunately, Butler's singing wasn't up to the demands of the role, and he was certainly no match for Rossum's Christine.<br /><br />Another problem is that the film alternates between lavishness and paucity.  The \\"Masquerade\\" number felt underpopulated, just a few people standing around a room watching a masked fop \\"vogue.\\"  It was a golden opportunity to cram the screen with dancing couples, like Lubitsch's \\"The Merry Widow\\" or even the original Lon Chaney \\"Phantom.\\"  Instead, a major number ends up feeling like a throwaway.  There's lavish, gorgeous sets galore, but sometimes they're just not handled right.<br /><br />To its credit, there are some very nice numbers; \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is a standout.  The sets and costumes are great.  But the supporting cast ranges from the workmanlike to the wooden to the hammy.  Shifting the story from the real Palais Garnier (the setting of the original novel, and the ALW musical, from what I remember) to a fictitious opera house is puzzling, as the Palais Garnier was very much one of the stars of the original story.  And a shift in time periods serves no purpose.<br /><br />Ultimately, it just doesn't gel.  I've heard they downplayed the Phantom's ugliness to avoid grossing out audiences, but that was a colossal mistake, as the Phantom's ugliness is one of the major elements that drives the story, and robs Christine's eventual kiss of any drama or sense of sacrifice.  (At the very least they should have rewritten some of the lyrics and dialog so they weren't always talking about how hideous he was...when he wasn't.  And a flashback scene to a young Erik being kept in a cage and mocked for his \\"deformities\\" is almost insanely idiotic when the extremely minor nature of his problem is revealed; people of that time would see far worse on the streets, what with skin diseases and war injuries in a time before prosthetics.)  This is a very highly romanticized version of the story, probably done less to satisfy fans of the Leroux Phantom story and more to satisfy the \\"Phans\\" who want Christine to choose the Phantom over Raoul.  (Even though the Phantom is a demented, deformed mass murderer and arsonist who used, manipulated, and decieved her for a long time, regularly threatens and berates her, wallows unceasingly in self-pity and blames everything on his ugliness, demands more love and devotion than any human being can give, menaces the people she cares about, is insanely obsessive, masquerades as her dead father in order to manipulate her further, demands complete and utter control of her, and can offer her nothing in the way of a real life or career...I guess these folks view Christine as unbelievably stupid and self-destructive and think that's romantic...)ely obsessive, masquerades as her dead father in order to manipulate her further, demands complete and utter control of her, and can offer her nothing in the way of a real life or career...I guess these folks view Christine as unbelievably stupid and self-destructive and think that's romantic...)
B00005JLCI|5.0|I plan to go see the play Hamlet in near future and wanted to see the movie to give me some background.  Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in this movie.  He is well known for his devotion to Shakespeare and Hamlet in particular, having played it several times on stage and screen.  I found this movie helpful to introduce me to Shakespeare's Hamlet as it is done with love and thoroughness.  Apparently other movies take aspects of the play - but this version brings it all together.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Since I loved the John Waters film I actually resisted this for 2 weeks.  My bad, because before seeing it my 2007 had been like...Doris Day at the Apollo.  I ended up seeing it four times in the next two weeks.  Three times alone, because my current pals are (sigh) anti-Musical (and completely non-musical).    I'll make this quick:  Nikki Blonsky is electric joy.  Zac Efron shows why he's Earth's Top Teen Idol (I'm very close to checking out High School Musical despite my age...).  The vets, not just great sport Travolta, but Walken, Latifah, Marsden (Cyclops--is that you?), and saucy Pfeiffer, are perfect.  Keep your eyes on Amanda Bynes, her every facial expression is hilarious, and she has some of the funniest lines in the show (including of course the Doris Day line I stole above).    The extras on the Shake and Shimmy Edition are must-haves.  Going well beyond the \\"mutual admiration society\\"-type commentary typical of many DVDs, this S&S Edition's tons of candid rehearsal backstage material makes a strong case that this project was a labor of love for all involved.  My early favorite is a too-brief scene with the whole cast, without makeup and in casual clothes, sitting around a huge table reading and singing their parts in front of everyone else.    Haven't yet checked out the \\"step by step dance instructions\\" or sung along to the lyric track (DVD-Rom features)...that will be an embarrassing personal experience that I suspect I should keep private and special.    I can't recommend this highly enough.  It is sheer pleasure from beginning to end.  Of course, make sure you get the original 1988 movie as well.
0151013047|3.0|The story of \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is unique and entertaining in the sense that it offers a viewpoint often left un-embraced in American war-obsessed media.  Told from a first-person perspective, the story reveals a Pakistani's short life in America, attending an Ivy League school, working a well-paying job, and suddenly--and quite unconvincingly--turning against the United States on moral grounds after a \\"hand of God\\" conversion by a Chilean bookstore owner (who, arguably, used his rhetorical skills solely to save his business, not out of passion for the moral ideals he passed on to the narrator).<br /><br />The structure of the novel is built around a one-way \\"conversation\\" between the Pakistani narrator and an American tourist.  This set-up lends itself to animosities toward the narrator, in that only he is given the opportunity to speak, causing all of his commentary to come across as negative assumptions.  The narrator is so well-spoken and carefully manipulative with his words that even when he dismisses hostilities with his words there hides an agenda designed to patronize and condescend.<br /><br />All in all, the narrator is quite unlikable, however the story is redeeming considering the rare viewpoint from which it is told.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|The aggregation of record labels into media conglomerates like Universal is turning out to be both a blessing and a curse. For an artist of Morrison's longevity, it means that a career-spanning retrospective can be assembled without the difficulties of cross-licensing. But doing so in only 21-tracks invariably short-changes important aspects of an artist's career, leaving off some hits (e.g., \\"Blue Money\\" and \\"Come Running\\") and benchmark album tracks in favor of covering beginning-to-end. On yet another hand, this anthology's producer has done a nice job of selecting tracks that demonstrate the evolution of Morrison's career, and sequencing them in a very palatable flow.<br /><br />The collection spans Morrison's mid-60s rock with Them, an iconic string of turn-of-the-70s pop-soul hits, '80s ballads, and through to 2005's soulful \\"Stranded.\\" But in the end, the limited space of a single disc, stretched across 40 years of recording, ends up serving neither Morrison the hit singles artist, nor Morrison the album artiste. In addition to the missing hits named above, key radio tracks (\\"Mystic Eyes,\\" \\"Tupelo Honey,\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\") were also omitted, and the holistic sense of landmark albums \\"Astral Weeks,\\" \\"Moondance,\\" \\"Tupelo Honey\\" and \\"Wavelength\\" is left as additional purchase.<br /><br />That said, what's here is magnificent, starting with the garage staple \\"Gloria\\" (a U.S. hit for Chicago's Shadows of Knight, but not for Them) and the impossibly blissful \\"Brown Eyed Girl.\\" Morrison's voice transforms to a jazz instrument for \\"Moondance,\\" and the trio of \\"Domino,\\" \\"Wild Night,\\" and \\"Jackie Wilson Said\\" are among the greatest blue-eyed soul ever committed to record.  Morrison dialed it back for 1973's \\"Warm Love,\\" but re-discovered his faith and backbeat for the joyous gospel-soul of 1978's \\"Wavelength.\\" He continued to explore soul and jazz in the '80s, adding rootsy sounds on songs like \\"Tore Down ala Ribaud.\\"<br /><br />The mid-80s selections show Morrison mellowed but still soulful, his husky voice providing counterpoint to smoother backings on \\"In the Garden\\" and \\"Someone Like You.\\" The latter is probably best known for its appearance in 2001's \\"Bridget Jones's Diary, Part 2,\\" though it was originally recorded fourteen years earlier. The string-lined 1989 love song \\"Have I Told You Lately\\" became a new Morrison signature, turning up on the soundtrack of \\"One Fine Day\\" and spawning dozens of cover versions. More blue-eyed soul followed, including the sumptuous \\"Days Like This,\\" the autobiographical \\"The Healing Game,\\" and the '50s R&B of \\"Precious Time.\\"<br /><br />It's a terrific and surprisingly organic journey from Morrison's garage rock roots through his authoritative, pop, soul, jazz and R&B sides. This is a well selected anthology that could easily turn Morrison's more recent fans onto his classics, or clue early fans into his terrific body of later work. But in both cases, listeners will need to supplement the overview with deeper helpings from the original albums. Alternatively you could pick up a greatest hits collection for Them, and purpose-built anthologies of his early Bang-era material, seminal '70s work for Warner Brothers and Mercury, and the Morrison-curated anthologies of his later work \\"Best of Van Morrison\\" Vols. 2 and 3. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a truly satisfying one-stop shop - and with a catalog this sprawling and deep, there may never be.

This book made me want to fill every free minute with reading it!  Very well written.  I was always trying to figure things out.  I highly recommend this book!
B000JVT1U0|4.0|This is a great movie. The kind of horror that doesn't need special effects and monsters. Just freaky people and freaky environment.    The dvd is the latest and best dvd version of this movie, too bad it looks washed out, but I guess its the best they could do.    Don't judge this movie based on the disgustingly bad remake of Nicholas Cage.
B000WQW988|5.0|i watched this Thanksgiving night on a 57 inch high def tv in full DTS surround and above that its like watching a totally different show. i mean i grew up watching this unplugged concert and listening to it for years but never have i experienced anything like this. its completly unedited and uncut. the banter between songs is amazing. you really get an idea what the band members were really like and what it must have been like to actually be at this concert. the songs sound totally new due to the remastering and on the rehearsals you get an even better look at how the band worked as a whole. there are a lot of things i could go on about but i dont want to spoil it for anyone. but one of my favorite parts is the end when Kurt signs a few fans CD's. its almost like he knew they were there, among all the record label people it seems like he had a knack for finding the real fans.      i totally reccommend this DVD to a true nirvana fan, youll be glad you got it.

I love to dance, I love to sing, and I love her work. Well done, Maddy.

B000VS6P9Q|3.0|The problem with a set like this is that only a true Dylan fan would be interested, but the Dylan fan would immediately realize that the covers are less rich and dynamic than Dylan's originals.  If you're looking for a different interpretation of Dylan's music, you're much better off looking for Dylan's covers of himself.  Over the years, he was constantly reinterpreting his own music in often fresh and interesting ways and some of this is available on his many concert recordings.<br /><br />I'm not opposed to covers in general.  I really enjoyed the \\"Instant Karma\\" and \\"I Am Sam\\" covers of Lennon and the Beatles.  This Dylan collection is not in the same league, unfortunately.

B00023B1A8|5.0|What's this, one of the three musketeers has no shoes on?   Graham Nash wore no shoes or socks during the entire concert.  Come on, lets get past the flower child era ok?  I appreciate it because I lived it, but what's up with that?  Anyway, that is my hang up, not yours.    Pretty good entertainment from 3 guys who Young would not team up for in this concert. A real shame vanity and egos get in the way of history making dvds.    Worth getting although I watched it only twice after getting it, even though I am a life long fan.
B00026WU4G|5.0|One great song after another, amazing band which includes Mark Knopfler on lead guitar, some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. This one's a keeper!
B000AYQJ3I|3.0|The technology of the era really hurts this dvd.  Great concert, but alas, it only rises to the technology of the era.  Get it for historical reasons but not for concert viewing excellence.  Some will like, some will not.   We watched it once and not twice, a sure indication that something wasn't quite right.
B0000024W3|5.0|All these years later, we can see this as one of Dylan's finest recordings. The recording sessions were done very tongue-in-cheek, so there are flubs & surreal curiosities like \\"All The Tired Horses\\" & \\"The Boxer\\". But in light of Dylan's later career, which embraced standards & songs from the great American songbook (not just 'folk') this has become a thoroughly enjoyable recording, generously long & impressively versatile. Personally, I love it. I think you will too.
B000BYRCRY|3.0|I'm a big fan of this movie, and the extras that come with this version are nice, but I wish I had of chosen the theatrical release. The extra footage that you'll find in this version is quite good, and does a better job of explaining some of the plot points and character motivations, and I did enjoy having the director and both main characters doing the commentary BUT the footage that was cut was cut for pacing reasons and as a result this version tends to drag on. If there's ever a director's cut I'll consider buying that, but, given the choice, I'd rather the good pacing and tempo of the theatrical release than the extra story points.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Musically, this is Dylan's greatest studio recording. But it's also his best album straight across the board. The songs all sound like they've been around for 100 years, like old standards. It's hard to believe it's 100% original material. Every song has great music, great lyrics, unbelievably great playing. This is one of the best albums you will ever own.
B00013F38K|5.0|I saw a bunch of 1-star reviews, and I decided to see why it is this classic series had so many bad reviews.<br /><br />Turns out it has nothing to do with the series, but rather there are 2 camps of thought on why this dvd deserves only 1 star:<br />1) People who are angry that they formatted the dvd wrong, that they cut off part of the picture to make it wide screen compatible. I agree that this is wrong, and should not have been done. But it does not affect how good the stories are and that this is still a great series.<br />2) People who are Bruce Lee fans and think Bruce Lee should have played the main character. They also are right: he should have. But at the time, executives thought the show would not have been popular with a Chinese star. They were probably right. So get over it, people! This is still a great series with great stories!<br /><br />So, let's review the SERIES, not the technical aspects of the dvd nor the history of racism in tv shows.<br /><br />This is a classic series. Worth seeing. Too bad there aren't more series like this today, teaching positive values instead of just violence, violence and more violence; sex, sex, and more sex...<br /><br />Sex and violence are okay, they make fun entertainment. But do ALL series have to be heavy on sex and violence? Can't we have some good adult entertainment with good values of peace, love, kindness and tolerance?<br /><br />A purchase of Kung Fu means a vote for wholesome entertainment!<br /><br />p.s. I'm not a \\"family values Christian wacko\\". I love the Shield and 24 and Prison Break and all that good stuff. I'm just saying that there should be a place for positive values, as well as just violence and sex.

0385335997|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books I have ever read.  If you like strong characters with real emotions that make sense and an author who can truly suspend your disbelief, this book is for you.  I actually picked this up used, read the whole thing, and went back to find the first two in the series.  My husband and I have completely different taste in books, and he loves it too.  I recommend the whole Outlander series.
B000VR824S|5.0|The 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival dvd I think is a great representation of what happened that day in July. I wasn't there, but being the music geek that I am (and so many of my favorite artists on the bill) I watched the entire webcast. I know, I know, big loser, but I enjoyed it a lot. Sure, there are all songs that we all wish would've been on there. Jimmie doing 'Extra Jimmies', Jeff Beck doing 'A Day In The Life', Derek Trucks' smoking 'Sahib Teri Bandhi/Maki Madni.' Heck, Alison Krauss & Union Station played a very good set and aren't even included on the dvd! But overall, I do think this was better than the original Crossroads dvd, if for no other reason that they got Jeff Beck on there.     As I mentioned, in addition to Clapton, so many of my favorite artists were on this bill: Sonny Landreth, Doyle Bramhall II, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin, BB King, Buddy Guy, Los Lobos, John Mayer, Robert Randolph. Heck, I even enjoyed Sheryl Crow, and she stuck out like a sore thumb! I certainly couldn't say that about the first Crossroads dvd, where I found myself skipping through several of the acts. That certainly doesn't happen here, except for John McLaughlin. I know he's very talented and has earned a lot of respect, but his stuff does nothing for me.    For what it's worth, my ten favorite moments from this dvd are, in no order:    1.Bill Murray and Eric Clapton's opening of the festival  2.Sonny Landreth and Eric Clapton jamming together  3.Derek Trucks and Johnny Winter on 'Highway 61 Revisited'  4.Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi on 'Little By Little'  5.BB King's toast to Eric Clapton  6. John Mayer's 'Belief'  7.Los Lobos' 'Don't Worry Baby'  8.Jeff Beck's 'Because We've Ended As Lovers'  9.Clapton's entire set including Steve Winwood and Robbie Robertson  10.Buddy Guy's entire set    For me, this was an enjoyable dvd to watch, and I'm sure it won't leave my player for quite some time.

0452287588|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and still learned something new. The first time I read it slowly so I could digest the concepts and apply them to my own condition. This book continues to have an amazing impact on my life and how I see the human condition as it relates to the world.    If we continue in the same manner we will certainly destroy this wonderful planet. We need to awaken and be more conscious of our actions. As Plato said, \\"the unexamined life is not worth living.\\"    I highly recommend this book.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Spanglish starring Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni is a serious and funny film about people's insecurities and there need to be loved. The only thing wrong with this film is the long dialogue, the characters speak too wordy and the scenes are too dragged out, the editor needed to cut the scenes better. The cast is quite good, an impressive performance by Sandler but who really steals the show is Leoni, her comic timing and flawless delivery is the main reason to watch this film. Cloris Leachman and Pas Vega are wonderful as well, defintely one to see, enjoy!
B00005JLSE|5.0|Bob Fosse's Chicago was initially produced as an unpretentious musical during the mid seventies and rumor has it that was intended to launch the career of \\"Bob's leading ladies\\".  It played for three years in Broadway and had a huge comeback during the nineties after the controversial O J Simpson case and it is still playing.<br /><br />A simple plot of murder, lust and injustice with minimalistic staging that became a hit movie in 2002, winning several Oscars including Best Movie and Best Actress (Katherine Z-Jones as Velma Kelley).  Other excellent actors were hired for the movie including Queen Latifah (the prison matron), Renee Zellweger (Roxie Heart) and Richard Gere (lawyer Flint).  Note that Chita Rivera (which was in the original musical), appears briefly in the movie as an inmate of the jail.<br /><br />This 2002 movie, by by Rob Marshall and Martin Richards, masterfully arranges a complex setting which constantly changes from the Chicago's Cook County Jail to the Club where the musical numbers are performed; similar to Liza Minelli's Cabaret.  But unlike Cabaret, the glitz and glamour make it a superb production.<br /><br />THIS DVD HAS EXCELLENT VIDEO, AUDIO PLUS SOME BEHIND THE SCENE BONUS FEATURES.<br /><br />CHICAGO IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL BROADWAY FANS....

Part of the fun is to try to find the subtle, deliberate technical errors designed into the movie so it wouldn't become a training film for criminals. Sneakers is highly recommended.
B000WCBMA8|4.0|The Black and White Album is sassy, experimental, and confident. It seems to be the most 'approachable' album out of the music that The Hives has created in their career in that it aims to be all-encompassing. The Hives stick to their roots, as seen through songs such as \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" (another anthem for the books), \\"Try It Again,\\" and \\"Return the Favour.\\" At the same time, the Swedish men have put great effort into expanding their horizons. At first, songs such as \\"Giddy Up\\" and \\"Puppet on a String\\" can raise some eyebrows of those who were expecting a continuous raw vibe. Give them time, and they just may be the cause of your foot-tapping and strutting antics in your room by the end of the day. If you were not into the Hives before, The Black and White Album seems to be the best way to get into them now. This is an album that will surely stay in your stereo for a long time.

0230013880|5.0|Utterly and completely enjoyable. I have been a big fan of Julia Donaldson since finding Room on the Broom. This one doesn't disappoint. It is the story of a Snail who decides that it wants to see the world, and the whale which picks it up - and where they travel too.    Beautiful meter in the lines, as with all Donaldson's books, but in this there is definitely something whimsical in the words - it is so beautifully written, but with great good humour.     The illustrations are amazing (as with all Shaeffers (sp??) work. I liked the little touches to the pictures, the boat next to the Snail in the first picture is the Spirit of Glasgow, which is Donaldson's hometown. Very fun and nice book which my children really enjoy too.
1582406723|2.0|I was intrigued when I caught sight of the Walking Dead series, being a casual fan of graphic novels and a big fan of classic zombie fare like Romero's [[ASIN:B0001611DI Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)]].  It seemed like a fun diversion, and author Robert Kirkman seemed to be headed in the right direction in his introduction, where he espouses the virtues of 'meaningful' zombie stories and establishes his intention to pay homage to greats of the genre like the aforementioned \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and the more recent [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]].  But he goes horribly wrong when he steals from them to construct his plot, making volume I of \\"The Walking Dead\\" feel like a pointless retread of already done ideas -- not to mention lazy.  From Romero's early zombie flicks we get old-school, slow-moving zombies (unlike the superfast variety featured in current media offerings), characters who reflect on the current state of the world while holing up in temporary safety, and the overarching themes of the series (lifted directly from \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" Kirkman's argument seems to be that modern people have forgotten how to really live in an amoral, commerce-crazed society).  The titular walking dead could easily refer to the survivors of the first zombie attacks just as much as the literally mobile deceased who have developed a taste for flesh.  We've also got the requisite transformation sub-plot, in which a character gets bitten and slowly succumbs to zombie-dom despite all efforts to prevent infection (although I'll grant that the outcome of that storyline does defy convention, so put down at least one originality point for Kirkman).  And from Danny Boyle's \\"28 Days Later?\\"  Well, the main character starts the series out waking up from a coma in an abandoned hospital to find the dead walking the earth ... which is EXACTLY what happens to Jim in \\"Days\\".  There's also the concept that attempting to mass a large number of humans together only serves to spread the 'disease' faster (one character's survival story of watching his whole family get mercilessly slaughtered while waiting in a crowd for military assistance in Atlanta is eerily reminiscent of \\"Days'\\" Mark, whose backstory includes watching his family succumb to the 'rage' during a botched military evacuation).  Homage, you might wonder?  Reads more like plagiarism.<br /><br />Kirkman aims high enough, but in the end he fails to bring anything fresh to the genre.  The artwork is stellar, but Kirkman's lazy reliance on established concepts is stultifying.  Skim through the pages to check out Tony Moore's detailed drawings, then skip ahead to [[ASIN:1582407754 The Walking Dead Volume 2: Miles Behind Us (Walking Dead)]] instead of wasting your time here.  In Volume 2 Kirkman actually breaks new ground and really gets his story moving in a way that can truly be called his.

B00005JN0T|3.0|Will Smith always delivers as an actor and I love the Sci-Fi action.  I loved the books in this series and would recommed them to people who like the movie.
B000009ED0|3.0|I do like some of this cd but, I don't alway like Kid Rock's rap music.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have a son and daughter who both love this movie.  This is a nice story but, younger children are often frightened by the Sea Witch.  I would not recommend for children under the age of 5.
B0000683DH|4.0|I really enjoy the Star Trek movies but, this has to be my favorite.  I grew up watching the Star Trek series and I think this one is true to the series.  I am not a Trekie but, I would recommend this movie for the Sci-Fi lovers out there.
B000001BX0|5.0|Para todos aquellos que no son fácilmente ofendidos por las palabrotas y las parodias, entonces esos deben escuchar este cd AHORA MISMO!!!  Agresivo, cortante, pero bien tocado y conciso, el primer cd de Molotov es una experiencia que uno no se quita fácilmente de encima. Lástima que a mis oídos Molotov no superó este primer trabajo.
B000002UAU|5.0|Plain simple, this could be easily the best album ever recorded, just only for its influence.  40 years and still fresh and daring.  This is The Beatles as you've never heard them before, or probably after (and the first ever album to have the lyrics printed in the back cover). Psychedelic, urban and extremely brilliant. Get this album and experience not just music, but a whole cultural movement.    NOTE: Im not a blind fan, and I'll be clear.  To me one song of the bunch doesn't work, and that'll be \\"Good morning good morning\\".  The Anthology version is far superior and cleaner although the guitar solo in here is really awesome. Its just the string and horns arrangements and the weird farm animal sounds that seems very out of place. But anyway, in spite of that, this must be the most important album ever (even if by today's standars of music sounds pretty dull). Period.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My 3rd purchase of this CD--one for me and 2 for friends. Even if you haven't seen the muscial but are an OZ fan, this CD takes you down the yellow brick road before it was built! Kristen Chenowith and Idina Menzel have the most soaring voices and portray their parts to the letter. The music is whimsical and wonderful. Steven Schwartz has a way with lyrics that defies gravity and beyond!!!!
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's book SHOCK DOCTRINE  describes perhaps the most horrific, monstrous movements in the history of the world-- Disaster Capitalism's Shock Doctrine. It has caused the deaths, maiming and torturing of millions throughout the world. It's supporters and promoters should be tried, convicted and imprisoned in the deepest, nastiest prisons.<br /><br />Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine, should be required reading by every American. This book has really shook me up. It's done a major surgical restructuring of my brain-- the way I look at the world, at politics. That's because it puts things together, adds things up, explains patterns-- malignant patterns, the way the US, the CIA, corporations and monstrous totalitarian dictators have operated. It ties these despicable creatures and crimes to neocon globalist, free trade philosophies.<br /><br />I'm not finished reading the book yet. But already, it has touched me so deeply-- I have to write about it.<br /><br />The MATRIX movie series suggested that once you can \\"see\\" the way the system works, once you are fully aware of how you function within the system, you have far greater power to make a difference, to fight the system.<br /><br />The SHOCK DOCTRINE shows you the \\"grids of power\\" within the \\"matrix\\" that corporate monsters have been operating within for decades, applying the neocon wetdreams of war criminal Milton Friedman, who took his economic theories and encouraged dictators and thugs to apply them fully, with the use of mass murders, tortures and disappearings. He made a science of it-- a science he was proud of, that the US and even major foundations funded and supported.<br /><br />The world has been subjected to these ideas, and they have been promoted as brilliant, necessary ideas for the evolution of commerce. Instead, they are monstrous, horrific, terrible ideas that serve not humans, but corporations.<br /><br />As I've said before, since the beginnings of the genre of science fiction, since Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, writers have described the creation of monsters by humans-- monsters that turn on humans and kill. Some go beyond killing a person to killing whole groups, towns, cultures. Some literally terraform the earth, changing it so it supports the monster, at the price of human life. Some of these monsters enslave humans. Some destroy the earth or lay it to waste, so humans can no longer survive on it. Arnold Schwarzenegger played a terminator, then a rebel terminator, from a computer/robotic group that was attacking and attempting to destroy humanity.<br /><br />I believe that this monster-- this terminator invention  has been prowling the earth, destroying cultures, killing and enslaving millions. It came into existence several centuries ago, and now it has reached it's most powerful form ever.<br /><br />I'm talking about the corporation. Small businesses can be quite benign. But the biggest transnational companies can be dangerous inhuman behemoths, capable of the most horrible atrocities.<br /><br />The most powerful nations have signed on the the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and other similar globalist organizations that pave the way for these corporate behemoths. These organizations are run by un-elected, often anonymous people who can make decisions and decrees that are forced down the throats of people who think they live in democracies.<br /><br />Klein's book is a huge best-seller, printed, off-the-bat, in seven languages. It lays out and documents massive crimes by Americans, by the CIA and by foreign subsidiaries of US-based corporations, including General Motors, Ford, ITT. Yet we see so little coverage of the book in the mainstream media. That's no suprise. They are part of the problem, and why I've morphed my language from calling them the lamestream media, which suggested failure to report and do the job, to corpstream media, which suggests intentional killing of the truth, in collusion with the massive corporations that control the mainstream media message.<br /><br />The main story Klein tells is that the US has helped dictators, in dozens of nations, to create chaos and confusion using military coups, torture, mass killings and horrific repression of free speech and protest. They use these criminal actions to: -take over a country,<br />-drastically reduce government services,<br />-reduce or eliminate laws and regulations that regulate corporations,<br />-take national resources that belong to the people and sell them off, privatizing them, to corporations-- things like water, forests, schools, roads, armies<br />-destroy the middle class to take away their power.<br /><br />They do these things to implement Milton Friedman's free trade, globalist theories as taught and promoted by the University of Chicago School of Economics. Friedman and his acolytes would consult with the worst of the torturing, murdering dictators, encouraging them to go ever further in destroying the middle class, in eliminating protections against corporate abuse. These University of Chicago economists are heinous criminals. They deserve nothing less than imprisonment in the darkest places, like Guantanamo. And with them, the heads of the corporations that have helped support these dictators, that have informed on union leaders-- they too belong in prisons for aiding and abetting torture, murder and, how would you describe destruction of nations, \\"nationocide?\\"<br /><br />Naomi Klein calls this \\"disaster capitalism.\\" The USA, often through the CIA, aided, even initiated, by support and advising and encouraging the dictators, some of the worst anti-democratic administrations. The USA engineered some of the stupidest coups that ended up creating some of our worst enemies. They do this without congressional support without \\"we the people\\" voting on these incredibly important decisions. And they lie and lie and lie to us, through the media through false testimony, false reports, totally fabricated news... that the corpstream media sells and flogs the public with until the dictators are seen as being the good guys and the democratically elected progressives are seen as dangerous socialists or communists who hate America.<br /><br />They're doing it now with Chavez in Venezuela and the drums will start banging louder for the progressive leaders in Bolivia and Brazil as well. The right wingers, the fascists in the CIA, the corporatists-- they really hate the idea of the spread of democracy by the people. What Bush has sold and pushed has not been the development and birth and natural emergence of democracy. He has been selling the \\"shock doctrine\\" version of \\"disaster capitalism\\" forced \\"democracy\\" that is not at all real democracy.<br /><br />In Iraq, after the shock was implemented, one of the first things that the US did was set up laws that applied the theories of Friedman. These Milton Friedman, University of Chicago School of Economics theories of free trade and globalism should be treated by the world as failed theories, theories that have had their successes hyped and distorted, propagandized and lied about. These theories should be seen as dangerous,as routinely used to excuse crimes against humanity. The people who espouse and advocate them are not simply egghead academicians. They are criminals who advocate, a few steps removed from the blood, the torture chambers, the assassinations and mass murders, all the ugly, horrible actions that the dictatorship take to implement their precious ivory tower theories. Let's be clear. These theories don't work. They are delusional fantasies, masturbatory fascinations of ugly, cowardly intellectual fools who have been willing to allow thousands to be killed and tens of thousands to be tortured for the sake of the purity of their ideas. Yes, that sounds like Nazi thinking. They are just as bad.<br /><br />Naomi Klein has done a fabulous job of listing many of these criminals who have perpetrated crimes against humanity. She makesit clear that much of the policies of the G8 nations are in alignment with these despicable theories. That has to change.<br /><br />The challenge is, Friedman's economic model, with the actions it has inspired is monstrous and evil. But we are not talking about a person who can be vilified and portrayed as evil, like Hitler or Mussolini. We're not talking about a party, like fascists or nazis.<br /><br />We are talking about a theory which has led to a model of attacking nations and democracies. It's much more difficult to make this a simple concept that can be attacked, which the people of this planet will be able to easily understand as a horrible monster run rampant. And that's what we need to have to fully attack and destroy, to kill and bury forever the ideas that Friedman and the University of Chicago School of Economics have perpetrated upon this planet.<br /><br />There are some readers of Shock Doctrine who consider the whole University of Chicago to be guilty of the crimes of the School of Economics. At first, since I know good people who have taught, done research or graduated from the University of Chicago, I defended the University. But perhaps, one step in attacking the economic model-- \\"Disaster Capitalism\\"-- that Friedman so successfully promoted, should be to push the University of Chicago to terminate the School of Economics-- to disown it. The many graduates, professors, researchers who have had nothing to do with Friedman's horror school of Economics, should revile it. They should, en mass, demand that the University cut off all association with the school.<br /><br />Congress should start investigating the CIA ties to the school and to Friedman and to the students and satellite universities around that world that helped to virally infect the planet with this concept of economics based upon violent coup de etats, torture, mass murder, destruction of the middle class and repression of human rights and freedoms.<br /><br />And don't expect the corpstream media to do any kind of acceptable job of covering it. The mainstream media are servants of the corporations that are guilty of the crimes I am discussing. The sell-out stenographic mainstream media reporters will happily report whatever they can to marginalize any serious attempts to cover disaster capitalism. They will mock legislators who advocate investigations, attack individuals as conspiracy theorists and fail to report on facts that emerge. They will unquestioningly accept reports, statistics and findings submitted by right wing government appointees who were appointed to spin reality.<br /><br />In summary, the planet and humanity have been under assault by a man made monster, invented several hundred years ago. The monster has insinuated itself into the CIA and much of government and grabbed power, often illegally so it now controls much of the world, much of the weapons, much of the decision making. Humans will have a hard time confronting this monster, in its current, ever more powerful, many tentacled, hydra headed iteration. It will take long term planning, brilliant use of language and media and the price will be high. This monster-- Disaster Capitalism and its Shock Doctrine--  does not hesitate to torture and kill, let alone lie, deceive and break all the rules.<br /><br />But at least now, with the help of Naomi Klein, we have the name and the number of the beast. The long road of challenges and battles has begun. Humanity, democracy, freedom and justice have been called to begin a heroic journey that could end in slavery for mankind and despoiling of the planet or the rising of a new civilization that casts out such evils and rises to new levels of greatness through justice, fairness and kindness.  This is not a journey for the faint of heart.<br /><br />I must add that Naomi Klein is a genius for putting the concept together, and should be awarded the highest honors-- Pulitzers, Nobels-- for researching and so thoroughly documenting therise of this monster-- Disaster Capitalism and its shock doctrine.  She is a true hero for humanity. That also puts her at some risk. It is ironic that she is probably not at GREAT risk because the message is not getting out far enough for her to be deemed a serious threat.

0142403873|5.0|Hugely enjoyable by both adult and children - a great one to read and laugh about. The illustrations always have something new in them to see and the rhymes are easily learned by the children because they are so funny and with great rhythm.    \\"A mouse took a stroll in the deep, dark Wood...\\" along the way he meets a fox, a snake and an owl. Because the mouse is clever he convinces them that he is going to meet a Gruffalo, of which the other animals have never heard of - but once they hear a Gruffalo's favourite food is respecitvely Roasted Fox, Scramble Snake and Owl Icecream - they aren't interested in eating the mouse. But then Mouse meets up with a real live GrufflOH! Mouse keeps his cool and even manages to fool him.    Glorious good fun from the team which bought you Room on the Broom and A Squash and a Squeeze - highly recommended reading!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I caught this movie on a flight over the areas depicted in Lord Of War. I had only paid scant attention to it when it came out because I thought it was a subject I had no interest in. Well, this movie has you caught by the throat from the opening titles and you are so sad to see the thing end!    Since everyone else has synopsized the story, I'll just dwell on the fascinating little things such as Orlov's immunity to prosecution when he's finally caught and why. I'll let you see the movie to find out. I'm sorry the fate of the cargo plane was disclosed, because it was funny and pretty incredible. I likened  it to ants finding a grasshopper's corpse.    I had never seen Jared Leto in a movie before but now I'm  seeing him all over the place. Looking like a modern day Jeffrey Hunter he's so incredibly handsome, I would describe  him as the next and young Brad Pitt. He did an outstanding job as Uri's duped brother haunted by conscience, something Uri just can't figure out.    Excellent movie all around, fast paced, never boring. If it had only been marketed differently I'd have paid to see it several times.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|Jimi Hendrix's closing set at the Monterey Pop Festival (following the Who's destruction of their own instruments) was only 40 minutes long  - but what an impressive 40 minutes! Will anyone who has seen the footage of him burning his guitar on stage (shown on the cover of this DVD) every forget that image?<br /><br />This reasonably priced DVD from Experience Hendrix (managed by Jimi's sister Janie) contains those 40 minutes and so much more. Guitar aficionados will appreciate the option to see different camera angles (my DVD player shows the angle image throughout so it wasn't important to me). Archivist types will enjoy the inclusion of the earliest existing footage of the Hendrix band playing in a small club in 1967. The new documentary \\"American Landing\\" has some fascinating interviews with those involved and is useful in explaining Hendrix's popularity to the next generation of fans.<br /><br />Another bonus which I found as a \\"hidden gem\\" is \\"Music Love and Flowers\\" a nice mini documentary on the Monterey Pop Festival itself. Sure the complete festival is out there on video on D.A. Pennebaker's film, but this short extra gives the background and contains new interviews with Lou Adler and John Phillips who basically organized it. This makes this package of interest even to fringe Hendrix fans.<br /><br />If Jimi was alive now he'd be eligible for Medicare this week! Can he have been gone so long and died so young (27!)?<br /><br />If this isn't in every Hendrix collector's DVD collection, I don't know why not.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00000ILDE|5.0|Excellent in all aspects.  Would definitely buy from this person again.  Fast shipping and product exactly as advertised.  5 stars.
0446577391|3.0|Loved reading it until... the last fifty pages.  Contrived and been there done that.  Very weak ending.  Balcacci has great characters, but he didn't get into them enough.  Too much contrivence.  Too much plotting.
0689878451|5.0|\\"And Tango Makes Three\\" is a wonderful book about 2 male penquins who are given the opportunity to raise a baby penquin. This is based on a true circumstance at the Central Park Zoo. I loved this book because it is helping to show children that there are other forms of families. This one just happens to be in the animal world. I am proud to own this book to read to my granddaughter and give her an open minded view of the real world.<br /><br />Thanks! D. S.
B00003CXC7|3.0|It has taken me a long time to get around to watching Rear Window. Perhaps the wait made me expect too much. Maybe this movie just suffers in my mind because I watched it not long after watching the masterful North By Northwest.<br /><br />Whatever the case, I was left a little underwhelmed.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is great, as usual. Grace Kelly is a knockout. I even like the nurse.<br /><br />Yet this movie drags.<br /><br />As I explained to my wife, who fell asleep a half hour in, not much happens. They sit around. They sit around some more.<br /><br />They conjecture.<br /><br />And then--boom. There is an ending. While this movie has all the stylish atmosphere you could want out of a Hitchcock movie, it does not rise the level of a Psycho, Vertigo, or North By Northwest.<br /><br />Rear Window is worth watching. It has some very funny dialogue and a couple of iconic moments. I just don't recommend investing in your own copy unless you are a Hitchcock completist.
0552550299|3.0|I bought this based on some reviews here but after three chapters I didn't feel the urge to go further for these reasons:    1) I didn't know anything about the young boy (and consequently, didn't care)    2) Same for the demon, Bartimaeus    3) Three chapters and he's going after an amulet (god, how original) that I also knew nothing about    4) Each page had some footnote and how this idea seemed brilliant to the author (and his editor) is beyond me.  It is a horrible idea for a novel (but great for science articles and textbooks). It breaks the flow of the narrative and if you have bad eyesight, the font size of the footnotes are so small you need a magnifying glass.    Another reviewer here said this: \\"Get past the first 40 pages or so and you won't be able to put it down until you find out just what evil Lovelace is up to and whether Nathaniel will be able to stop him.\\"      Hmmm.  Well, if your first forty pages don't draw me in, why would I trust the author for the next 350?    Maybe it's great.  It did inspire me in one sense.  If a novel can get published with the first three chapters like this, man, let me fire up my word processor!      At any rate, I gave 3 stars just in case the remaining 350 pages actually said anything interesting.  I'll keep it in my bookshelf if I get completely bored.    Tim
1582701709|1.0|Rhonda Byrne laughs and points at each sucker who falls for this...all the way to the bank.  From the previous success of all the other \\"new\\" life-style concepts, she knew there was a huge market who would flock lemming-like to shell out their money to make all of HER wishes come true.  If only these people had known that all they needed to do was WISH for the book to come to them, they could have saved that money to pay for the gas to put into the new BMW that would magically appear in the garage of the new home they got just because they wanted it.      I actually had someone tell me that my sister wished for her breast cancer.  Yes, Debra had read The Secret.  And, yes, she really said that.  Apparently, she also wished that she was as stupid as she sounded.    She must also have wished me out of her life because she got that, too.  I could not take anything she said seriously after this.    Yes, I read it (and promptly returned it for a refund...sorry, Rhonda) so that I wouldn't be making statements about something I didn't know of first hand.  Refer to my first paragraph above to see what secret I learned.  Other than that, the only thing this accomplishes is to allow already-self-centered people to feel justified in thinking only of themselves and hope that the rest of us will simply go away.  It's a very sad statement about the direction so many are headed.    I'm willing to bet that sooner or later (after she milks this dry), Rhonda Byrne will come out with another book to say she was wrong about it and to \\"share\\" those new revelations with everyone.  And since all those people who fell for her first get-rich book will still be searching for happiness (because they keep looking in all the wrong places), they'll flock lemming-like to buy it.
B00005AG7K|1.0|The product I received was an obvious pirated copy.  The cover was low quality, but more importantly, the DVD was very low quality.  I think this was produced by someone filming the screen in a movie theater.  The video was fuzzy and the sound was crummy.  The only reason I give it a star is because it played.  I was surprised to see this from Amazon, even though it came from a 3rd party vendor.
1592332803|5.0|The Joy of Vegan Baking is a beautiful book with delicious recipes that happen to be vegan.  As a former vegetarian, now vegan, I thought that I could never make the switch.  One of my reasons was that I didn't want to say goodbye to things like cake and cookies.  Colleen's podcast and this book taught me that I could have my cake and be vegan, too.  So far everything that we tried has been great.  The chocolate chip cookies and foccacia have been favorites.
006074748X|5.0|My love of horses brought me to this book and it didn't dissapoint. The surgery done on Piebald ( the horse) was explained in detail. The old horse was useless to the Circus.  They wanted and needed horses who could perform beautiful movements like the \\"Airs Above The Ground\\". The old horse is rescued and as in all Mary Stewart books there is a chase, this time along the top of a mansion. MS is intriguing in that she writes in detail.  You can smell and feel the circus and everything about it. As always, MS keeps me reading even when I guess the ending.
630463949X|5.0|This is an outstanding concert video of Fleetwood Mac.  Lyndsey Buckingham's performance is phenomenal, and both Stevie and Christi are outstanding.  This goes to prove that the great artists just get better with age.  This is the definitive Fleetwood Mac performance!
B000YABV90|5.0|I went to see this movie without having seen any reviews (a friend convinced me to go), and so I didn't know what to expect. It didn't take me very long to be engrossed in the film, but the highlight was definitely when the lead character, 11-year-old Evan Taylor, starts playing the music he hears. It's so inspirational, and the music is so different and amazing. I loved it. A beautifully made film with such a lovely message. I appreciate a previous review that explained that the movie is a fairy tale. And it is, full of the sweetness, vitality and greatness that we all hope for in real life.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|Saw this at a small theater in Las Cruces, NM, and laughed until I cried! as did the whole audience. Highly recommended for some silly fun.
B0000084J7|5.0|This sparse Miles Davis influenced stunner from former Talk Talk vocalist/ songwriter is a must own must have life changing cd if there ever was one. Its hushed downtempo ambience and slowburn intensity rivals any music put to tape. Anyone into Miles davis or the last two great cohesive Talk Talk records will love this. Everyone else with a longing for timeless music needs to just stop reading the reviews and get it. I never thought a cd from the 90s would deserve a place in the my top ten of alltime but Mark Hollis is it. Perfect down to every note brushed drum and mournful vocal. Mark, if you ever read this- thank you for this fantastic album and know that many of us think this is simply one of the greatest ever!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I really like to use this flash.  Bouncing the flash off of the ceiling gets great results vs a head on flash.  I have considered upgrading to an SB-600 but havent found many convincing reasons to.  For amateur uses this flash gets the job done.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Yes, I've read all of the reviews about Paramount's \\"double dipping,\\" et al.  I agree that some films/shows are reissued to death on DVD.  In this case, however, we get something new.  Although the new CGI effects are brief, they make a world of difference in watching the shows.  Certain aspects of these shows will always remain dated, but the original special effects were just crap and really hurt the shows in my opinion.  So, I'm actually quite glad to see these!  I agree with others about the price, though.  I can only view the standard DVD sides.  I don't have an HD player and probably never will--so I feel that I had to pay extra $$ for material that I will probably never be able to see.  The jury is still out on the HD format wars and I'm not committing to any new format until all of the dust has settled.  Been burned before with the Beta vs VHS, CED vs laserdisc, etc.

B0000640VO|5.0|To get this out of the way, yes, 'Amelie' is a French film, complete with subtitles and a slightly different set of goals and priorities for director Marc Caro than would be found in a blockbuster from Hollywood.  That said, 'Amelie' is a stunningly magnificent film focusing on the happiness that may be found for the protagonist for which the film is named, played perfectly by Audrey Tatou.<br /><br />Caro and Jeunet have teamed up before to bring such magnificent films to life as [[ASIN:B00000K3TS The City of Lost Children]] and [[ASIN:B000E8NRUS Delicatessen]].  In 'Amelie' the team brings another serving of their visual stylings that are easily described as a painting brought to life through film.<br /><br />The soundtrack, coloring, filming techniques, characters, and set design combine to forcefully and gracefully portray the simple life of this waitress from Montmarte and what little things are necessary in order for her to become a happy person.
B000I2J2WM|4.0|This HD-DVD has great picture quality.  I also think it is one of if not the best racing movie ever.  The transfer from film to HD is amazing, the cars just POP. I have this already on VHS and DVD.  I do not regret adding the HD-DVD version.
0780622553|5.0|\\"Dark City\\" is director Alex Proyas' vision of what is to come within the world of neo-noir.  Carefully selecting sets, characters, writing, actors, wardrobe and the bevy of other options and decisions a director must select and choose during the filming a movie, Proyas is able to bring an original movie that captures the imagination of science fiction, but without relying on many of the older mechanisms and structures recycled time and again by lazy scifi writers and directors.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell's character awakens in a simple bathtub, which like everything else in the film, has been carefully created to have an old, new, and simultaneously, timeless quality to it.  Without any memory he endevours to find out what is really going on, with the help of his wife, played by Jennifer Connelly, a friendly policeman played by William Hurt, and a corrupt psychologist, played exceptionally well by Kiefer Sutherland.<br /><br />It is incredibly difficult to explain the film without giving away many of its novel surprises so stop wasting time and see this to experience them for yourself.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This set is amazing. The documentary is great, as is the video quality.  This is a great HD DVD to show off your home theater.  The narration is informative and interesting.  I highly recommend this product, just make sure you have an HD-DVD player for it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Combining the visual appeal, coloring and decadent richness of [[ASIN:B00000K3TS The City of Lost Children]] and the film noir aspects of [[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City (New Line Platinum Series)]]and [[ASIN:6305999872 Touch of Evil (Restored to Orson Welles' Vision)]], 'Sin City' is a fantastically novel approach to the adaptation of graphic novels to film.  Director Robert Rodriguez artfully crafts a sublime fantasy world where life is as terrible as it is richly adorned with well-developed characters portrayed by actors like Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Benicio Deltorro, and so many more.  If you have somehow managed to not see this movie so far, I recommend you change that as soon as you can!
0099765217|1.0|I couldn't even bear to finish this book. I kept thinking throughout the book, how was this published? If Mr. Palahniuk had taken out all the fluff he added, the book would have been half the size. It's boring, stupid, the author has an amazing talent to make this book that has a half decent plot, into the worst piece of literature I've ever read.

B000YAF4OS|5.0|Up until the point that I saw this film, the best Stephen King adaptation that I had seen was the spectacular \\"Misery\\".  Once the lights went up on this one though, my mind had changed on that.  \\"The Mist\\" is the best Stephen King adaptation to date.  Yes, it even beats other adaptations such as \\"The Shining\\".  The story is very simple; after a thunderstorm a strange looking soupy mist descends on a small town.  Several townsfolk find themselves barricaded very quickly in a supermarket after something in the mist starts attacking people in the town.  The movie centers around the characters' inner struggles with themselves as well as the predicament that they find themselves in, as well as with eachother.  The acting is brilliant and first-rate, particulary Marcia Gay-Harden's appearance as a Jim Jones type religious fanatic.  Each and every performance is authentic and filled with heart and emotion.  The suspense is the edge-of-your-seat variety.  And there is no shortage of shock-value either.  The creatures that roll into town with the mist are bizarre, gruesome and eye-popping.  As far as the controversial ending that differs so greatly from the novella, there is absolutely nothing bad about it and it fits perfectly with the nature and direction of the film.  If you were expecting a \\"Mary Poppins\\" type of ending, then you were at the wrong movie.  This movie is a dark, brooding film.  When you look at the context and the flow of the movie, the ending makes sense, although there is absolutely no question that it is shocking and will have you doing a double-take at the screen.  The point of it all, which the movie illustrates is, that there is no escape from the mist.  The mist slowly engulfs and takes over every character in some way or another in the film.  The movie does have a few flaws, but not enough that it's not worth your money.  A highly recommended film, \\"The Mist\\" packs a wallop.
B00005JPS9|1.0|I wrote this for a class directly after seeing the movie.<br /><br />---<br /> To compare Beowulf the poem and Beowulf the film adaptation is, perhaps, a task beyond me.  The film achieves what few films can--that near perfect balance between infuriating inanity and transcendental awfulness which is usually exclusive to musicals.  I have had a touch to drink, however, and through the (perceived) eloquence of intoxication I feel that I may be up to the challenge of a critique.  To say I am impassioned on the topic is to engage in supreme understatement--Beowulf the film will, from this day forward, serve as my single perfect example of Hollywood's utter uselessness, except perhaps as a sort of `motivational enemy' for the ideals of art.<br /><br /> The film begins well enough.  Hrothgar is a drunken boor who is rude to his wife (which is perhaps forgivable), the Danes are in their mead hall (which is infinitely less glorious than the hall of the poem), and the sounds of merry making are driving Grendel crazy (which is correct).  Even this early in the film, however, one begins to sense that the characters have been twisted.  Hrothgar is not a particularly good king--the best thing he does is sober up enough to wave his sword and yell at Grendel.  Queen Wealhtheow does not respectfully serve her husband-king mead, but spits on him when he tries to drag her to bed.  When Beowulf arrives, he does not offer his services in a spirit of noble duty as Beowulf of the poem seems to, but instead blusters in and obnoxiously yells his boasts at the gathered crowd; when challenged by Unferth as to the swimming contest, he tells the tale of the sea monsters, but according to the film, much of it is exaggerations or lies.<br /><br />And this is what drives the film; Beowulf the poem is an exaggeration or a lie.  The filmmakers engage in the same mistake that Tolkien criticized in \\"The Monsters and the Critics,\\" namely, an attitude of intense historical criticism which does not appreciate the poem as a work of art.  The film is not at all `realistic,' however.  It retains the fantasy elements of the poem (monsters, demons, dragons) but applies the story with the trowel of ugly cynicism, which is likely just an attempt to justify making the film by `putting a different perspective to it.'  And the filmmakers have the GALL to take potshots at the original poem by referencing it in the movie.  \\"The Song of Beowulf\\"--i.e., the poem we know today--is the `official version' of Beowulf's story which Beowulf's court bards promulgated and which we poor contemporary saps buy into.<br /><br />The list of offenses is endless, ranging from the contradiction of small details to an entire reworking of major plot points.  Glorious speeches are truncated to fits of lusty yells; religion is referenced in a few derisive remarks. In order to satisfy the Hollywood requirement for romance, Beowulf falls in love with Wealhtheow.  And in order to satisfy the Hollywood requirement for sex, everyone is given to sleeping with either people they're not supposed to or demons.<br /><br />In fact, this is the beginning of progressive deviations from the poem's plot--Hrothgar, it seems, slept with Grendel's mother and is the secret father of Grendel.  After killing Grendel (who apparently shrinks in size when you hit him enough), Beowulf goes to kill Grendel's mother and ends up sleeping with her also (thereby gaining not only Angelina Jolie but promises of fame and power).  Instead of becoming king of the Geats, Beowulf becomes king of the Danes after Hrothgar wills his kingdom to Beowulf and then commits suicide.  And the dragon Beowulf kills as an old man is his own son from sleeping with Grendel's mother.  Through all of this, Beowulf can't even wear the oft-lauded boar helmet from the poem, but opts for a Chuck Norris-esque headband instead.<br /><br />None of this is Beowulf!  Irrelevant of what points the movie may share with the poem, then, they are entirely contradictory.  Beowulf is not a near-infallible hero, the movie says; there is no such thing.  Instead, let's destroy any concept of idealized role models and make a lousy film!  Even Wiglaf--the one character who is both honorable and reliable throughout the film--is implied to pursue Grendel's mother after Beowulf dies, thereby perpetuating the horrendous cycle of evil and leaving no hope of relief for the Danes.<br /><br />The poem is about a hero--THE hero of our Western tradition.  Instead of an honorable, noble, serving, evil-battling hero, the film's Beowulf is \\"a man, fallible and flawed,\\" which Beowulf conveniently explains to us just after he's confessed to sleeping with evil instead of killing it.  The poem lauds ideal heroes; the film disdains ideal heroes as fantasy.  The respective messages of the poem and the film, then, are utterly at odds, and as works of art, they are mutually exclusive.  I regret seeing the film and I wish it had never been made.hero, the movie says; there is no such thing.  Instead, let's destroy any concept of idealized role models and make a lousy film!

B000UR9T82|4.0|I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first two movies.  But the first 110 minutes of this movie were a mix of depressing and flat out boring.  Right at 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie starts to get really good--and the last 20 minutes are wonderful with the same characteristics of the first two movies: action, drama, tension are all present and well represented.  Unfortunately, there's none of that in the sophomoric build-up of the characters in the first 84% of the movie.<br /><br />If it hadn't been Spider-man, I would have turned the movie off long before 110 minutes into it.<br /><br />So if you want to see this movie, rent it and stick it out (or fast-forward) to the last 20 minutes.<br /><br />My S.O. and I have 2 copies of the first 2 movies on DVD.  But neither of us feel like buying even one copy of the third movie.
0440238609|2.0|I was initially wary of the marketing blitz surrounding this series in anticipation of the upcoming film, but eventually decided to buy the books because of favorable comparisons to the Harry Potter, Narnia, and Oz series, all of which I loved.      While I did enjoy learning about the inhabitants of Lyra's world in the 1st book, the exclusively negative portrayal of religion made me squirm even as a non-religious academic.  The 2nd and 3rd books were not only filled with blatant political agenda, but also frustrating to read from a literary standpoint as none of the characters seem to have logical motivations and the plot abounds with inconsistencies.  I was not favorably impressed.    Pullman's creation of the world of witches, daemons, and armored bears could have been an appealing backdrop for a fanciful epic, but the series that he actually wrote is ridiculous, frustrating to read, and will be offensive to many.   I am embarrassed to have bought into the marketing hype and I caution other fans of fantasy writing not to have too high of expectations.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan that has been waiting for something like this for a while.  I feel like some of P.J.'s new stuff doesn't come close to their older albums....until this CD came along.  I know this is a solo gig for Eddie Vedder but its fantastic!!  I listen to it all the time!!  My husband, who is not a fan of Pearl Jam's recent work, LOVES this CD....which says a lot!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Pearl Jam's older stuff or to anyone who is looking for the perfect holiday gift to give!!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I review this purely as a stand alone CD and cannot claim to be a huge Springsteen fan as i dont own and havent listened to all his releases. I do have a fair few releases though so believe I can comment with some justification.    In my view this is an absolute cracker of a CD. The melodies are just awesome and the singing just great (I do agree that understanding the lyrics takes a tuned-in ear and the music does have this kind of muddled effect) but that seems to give this CD a kind of \\"dreamy\\" sound which i just love.    I own a copy of Born to Run and find that also muddled in sound quality.     Anyway Back to Magic - I cant find a dud track on this release. Rarely do i buy a CD and instantly want to repeat a track after first listen because of its immediate impact on me. With Magic i found myself doing that on every track.    This is really a great great great release. If you have it in your car - crank up the volume and be blown away by some of the best melodies your likely to hear in a long time.    Lets be greatful the world still has some real musicians playing real music out there in Radio Nowhere land.      Pure Magic !!!
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed two thirds of this wonderful book.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert takes us with her on her travels.  We go to Italy to eat, to India to pray and to Indonesia to find balance.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Gilbert's sense of humor, she had me laughing out loud many times while reading her quips and quotes from friends and relatives giving her advice.  One of my favorites is her sister telling her that having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face, you have to really want one.  What a great analogy.  When Liz talked about her boyfriend David she said that he was catnip and kryptonite to her.  She has a wonderful way of putting things, she really hit my funny bone with her sense of humor.<br /><br />I loved the first part of this memoir where we travel to Italy and meet her mellow and wise Italian friends while she enjoys all foods Italian and puts on more than a few pounds.<br /><br />I also loved the third part of Gilbert's journey where she travels to Bali and tries to find balance in her life.  I loved hearing about the dear friends she makes and the impact she has on their lives.<br /><br />I admire her journey through self-examination and to self-discovery.  Her journey wasn't easy.  And I think that the second third of this book was more difficult to read because of her painful journey.  I honestly couldn't wait to be done with the second portion of this book.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert is funny and smart and somewhat exhausting.  Everything she does she does at full tilt; traveling, eating, praying and loving.  She lives... like she was dying.<br /><br />She offers many oppournities for us to ask ourselves the same questions she struggles with.  I enjoyed her story of growth and examination and I am happy to have read it.  It moved me to tears on more than one occasion.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the history she shares with us along the way...very interesting.

Khaled Hosseini writes in an easy to read format, while mixing in beautiful and brilliant imagery to document the two hard lives of women living in Afghanistan through turbulent times.  You find yourself rooting for these women and never losing hope as Afghanistan's rulers and cultures change.  I was so moved by this book that upon completion went back on Amazon and bought a copy for my sister to share this great story.  I wholeheartedly reccomend it!
160024131X|5.0|This book does an excellent job of introducing as well as honoring our Special Forces personnel.  They are dedicated and courageous soldiers. They risk everything in the defense of our Nation yet still retain a moral compass under the most trying situations.  It is disgraceful that our current political leaders place them directly in harm's way then saddle them with 'Rules of Engagement' that are inconsistant with the reality of their situation.  The detailed description of the battle fought by these 4 heroes against an overwhelming enemy force is intense and heart breaking.  May God bless them.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I have followed Britney's career for a while now, and allthough I think most of her music is a little to sugary, mostly the music from her first two albums. I do think she has always had the ability to put out relevant pop music that makes people want to dance. With the \\"Britney\\" albums and it's great first single \\"Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" which I could never understand why it was never released as a single. And her 2003 follow up \\"In The Zone\\" was probably one of the best pop albums of the last 15 years. With great songs such as \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", \\"Early Morning\\", \\"Shadow\\" and  the hit \\"Toxic\\".     I was alittle put off by the first single from Blackout Gimme More. It was a good song but it wasn't \\"Slave 4 U\\". But once I got the album I was more than satisfied with the albums tracks. I love the fact that Britney doesn't dwell in sarrow threout the entire album. But that she focuses on having nothing but a good time.     Here is my track to track review...    Gimme More-(5/10)- It is a good song, we have all heard it. It has always had a nice groove but I never really gotten into it.    Piece Of Me(10/10)-For me this is when the album really starts. On it Britney adresses her many critics both professional and personal, but mostly personal. The song is synth heavy and Britney's voice is altered threw out most of the song, which all adds to the effect of the song.    Radar(6/10)-A good pop song, in the vein of \\"Toxic\\". It has a catchy chorus and it will stick with you after a while even if you don't really like it. Has a Euro-pop feel to it.    Break The Ice(8/10)- A great dance track, this should have been the first single off of the album in my opinion. It has a nice beat and melody and a better driving force behind it than \\"Gimme More\\" did. It has a nice synth and hip hop feel to it. With an unexpected breakdown at the bridge which last threw the rest of the song.    Heaven On Earth(8/10-A nice 70's early 80's disco feel to it. Britney goes for what is very popular in pop right now, a Donna Summers or Blondie inspired 80's synth mid tempo song. This song could have easily been a hidden track on Gwen Stefani's Love.Angel.Music.Baby. album.    Get Naked(9/10)-Another great unexpected dance song just like it's predecessor \\"Break The Ice\\". But it takes a more risky route than Ice did. With Nate Danja Hills yelling in the background in a deepened altered voice(think Janet Jackson's \\"That's The Way Love Goes\\") and Britney kittishly purring \\"Do\\" at the same time, creates an eerie hypnotic feel threw out the song. It's a very weird and ambitious song to come from Britney.    Freakshow(7/10)-Has a Euro-pop and hip hop beat, very cool song but seems to get lost within the feel of the album to me.It seems more like a appetizer to hold you over till  \\"Toy Soldier\\" than a song that can stand up on it's own.    Toy Soldier(10/10)-Perhaps the song that can put \\"Toxic\\" to rest as her best pop single. It has an electro/Euro-pop beat. And Britney has so much attitude on it, as she practically proclaims threw out the song that she is sick of Toy Soldiers and want's a real soldier  that can hang and take care of her, and that \\"new Britney is on a mission\\". I Wonder who she could be talking about as a Toy Soldier?!?!      Hot As Ice(8/10)- Again another song that seems inspired by \\"Toxic\\". Britney's voice is altered. But this song has a good feel to it and it makes you want to move to even if it is a little weird. It seems as if it is an updated version of Britney durring her sugary pop era.It mixes electro-pop/Euro-pop/ and hip hop together with a pleasant result.    Ooh baby Ooh baby(6/10)-Good pop song, reminds me alot of \\"Radar\\" with the catchy hook. But doesn't seem to have anything more behind it like \\"Freakshow\\". But still a potential hit single.    Perfect Lover(7/10)-I really like this song, it has a groove to it that reminded me of something that Janet Jackson would have done especially with the mellow breakdown atthe end, it's pure \\"Velvet Rope\\" Janet. It's a very sexy and mature Britney.    Why Should I Be Sad(10/10) Perhaps other than Piece Of Me, it's the most personal song on the album. Britney talks about her relationship with Kevin in a candid way that is both disturbing but refreshingly intriguing at the same time. As she sings in the second verse \\"I sent you to vegas with a pocket full of paper and with no ultimatums on you...I thaught what could seperate us... but it just seemed that vegas only braught the playa out of you.\\" and later in the song \\"Don't worry I'll keep our little secret when I ask this question...Why should I be sad\\". The song is produced by The Neptunes and has a beat I think that is a little reminiscent of Justin Timberlakes \\"My Love\\" just slowed down a bit.    All in all this album is a great pop album to let go to and just have fun. It seems like Britney finally got the formula for a dance worthy album down pack. I definitly recommend this album to pop lovers.
B000001ELB|5.0|Double Platinum by Kiss is the best of this Hot Rock Band.  Do not buy all the other compilations of their mixed bag of songs.  This disc has all the good ones you need.

Get this and then buy Love Gun, it's missing I stole your love and Christine Sixteen, other than that every song on Double is Great and once you play it you will want to hear it again.
140120306X|3.0|The first League of ExtraOrdinary Gentlemen book was a romp.  The movie did it justice, except that for Politically Correct Reasons they had to change the villain to a nondescript caucasian rather than the book's Fu Manchu.    The second book followed in the footsteps of the first, being the League's reaction to HG Well's War of the Worlds invasion of England.  This one really doesn't seem to have much of a plot.  Again, the League is involved in obtaining the Black Dossier after the end of the \\"Big brother\\" era described in 1984 from the British Secret Service (incorrectly identified as MI-5.  BSS is MI-6.)    James Bond and M and \\"Sir John Night's daughter (very obscure reference)\\" are the villains.  We're not really told who the heroes are until the end.  Most of the book is \\"additional reading\\"; the graphic novel part of the book is actually very little of it.  The plot is simply, they obtain the book and escape with it with the villains on their heels and finally escape to the fifth dimension.  There are an awful lot of obscure references in the book.  I caught most of them, being very well read with four college degrees, but most people would be spending hours online to \\"get\\" the jokes and references.  I don't think you should have to have a master's degree in English literature just to read a graphic novel.  Earlier novels had fewer outside references and more plot.

This is a rare look behind the curtain at what is really happening in the battle to secure our freedom. This is not for the smug, self satisfied among us who are not willing to admit that our liberties are at risk in the year 2007. Or maybe that is exactly should read this book. This is a serious story about young men who fight, and sadly die, for us. We owe everything to them and their families. I am proud to count Marcus Luttrell as a countryman.

B000002P5W|5.0|Axis is a marvelous piece of work by Mr. Hendrix.  Every song is good and shows this mans talent.  He just lets go and rocks out, then sweetly and gently sings \\"Little Wing\\", then jams into \\"If 6 was 9\\".  Wow, never was turned on to Jimi earlier, but now I am a big fan.  If you get this and do not already have his first and third cd, get them.  They are a story that needs to be heard all together.
B000NQR7KC|4.0|I'm going to step in and give a review of the Super Audio version of this recording. It's a nice package that restores the original LP artwork to the CD booklet, which wasn't done in all previous versions. The box includes a CD/SACD multichannel disc as well as a video disc containing a multichannel DVD Audio version of the album plus some video extras in the North American NTSC format. The 2007 interviews with the band members are quite revealing, including some comments from Steve Hackett on why the four became three.<br /><br />At least they had a sense of humor about it! At the time of its release, And Then There Were Three got a fair amount of criticism. Even some fans said the album took few risks, with the L.A. Times commenting that the band could have \\"written this stuff in their sleep.\\"<br /><br />But this record in particular had a strange effect on listeners, which I recall from reading letters in music magazines at the time. The sound producer David Hentschel (he previously engineered Elton John's  Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) achieved was dense, thick as London fog, with a narrow stereo stage producing a late '70's version of the old \\"wall o' sound.\\" All that melody and rhythm packed into 50-plus minutes was exhausting to listen to, with the catchy, stripped-down \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" at the end serving as a light dessert. Looking back, it's probable that this recording helped launch later groups like Lush and Cocteau Twins that favored layered sonics.<br /><br />Nick Davis' multichannel remix opens up the Hentschel mix considerably. This new version loses just a little of the recording's original character, but much is gained as the music becomes both grander and more intimate. Heard through a multichannel system, Phil Collins' voice sounds more out front and clear. I thought it might be too bright at first listen, but I soon came to like the effect. Of course, your CD player factors in this.<br /><br />With the individual instruments heard more clearly, songs like \\"Down and Out,\\" the band's musings on the cutthroat nature of the record business, gain considerable power. And we can finally hear Genesis' songs about the American West in their wide-screen glory as Mike Rutherford's guitar on \\"Deep in the Motherload\\" just comes storming out of the sound field. \\"Ballad of Big\\" really sounds big now as Jim and his men become legends the hard way.<br /><br />For me, the most appealing songs on And Then... Three  are the ones that use dynamics to reflect their characters' shifting emotional states. \\"Burning Rope\\" does this well, and the recording allows Tony Banks' unusual and affecting keyboard sounds to be heard with greater depth and clarity. He does his own synthesizer programming, unlike many bands of the era, and obviously takes time to develop particular sounds that suit the songs.<br /><br />I always thought that the song \\"Say It's Alright, Joe\\" was kind of a throwaway. In multichannel sound, you feel a lot closer to the story. You might be in the barroom with Joe and his down-on-his-luck customer as Tony tinkles the piano keys.

And we can finally hear Genesis' songs about the American West in their wide-screen glory as Mike Rutherford's guitar on \\"Deep in the Motherload\\" just comes storming out of the sound field. \\"Ballad of Big\\" really sounds big now as Jim and his men become legends the hard way.    For me, the most appealing songs on And Then... Three  are the ones that use dynamics to reflect their characters' shifting emotional states. \\"Burning Rope\\" does this well, and the recording allows Tony Banks' unusual and affecting keyboard sounds to be heard with greater depth and clarity. He does his own synthesizer programming, unlike many bands of the era, and obviously takes time to develop particular sounds that suit the songs.    I always thought that the song \\"Say It's Alright, Joe\\" was kind of a throwaway. In multichannel sound, you feel a lot closer to the story. You might be in the barroom with Joe and his down-on-his-luck customer as Tony tinkles the piano keys.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I'm going to start off by saying I like all of Dream Theater's stuff. They are my favorite band. This is because I love the astonishing solos, and great musicianship.     Systematic Chaos easily beats their last 2 albums Octavarium and Train of Thought. The album kicks off with In the Presence of Enemies pt. 1. This is a very fun song to listen too, and is one of my favorites on the album. 10/10    Then comes Forsaken. This song is really cool. It's not as good as In the Presence of Enemies, but it still gets a 10/10.    Next is Constant Motion. I don't like it so much. James' voice is too well weird. 6.5/10    The fourth track is Dark Eternal Night, and I have to say it's my least favorite track ever from Dream Theater. It's boring especially in the middle and I have never skipped a Dream Theater song halfway through because all of them are good. 3/10    Repentance, track 5, is the fourth part in Mike Portnoy's AA suite. It is awesome but they could've cut the last 5 minutes. 9/10    Prophets of War is a Muse style song. I find it really cool. I'm a Muse fan so I liked it even more. 10/10    The Ministry of Lost Souls is the best track on the album. It has a cool fantasy story behind it. I love listening to it. IT earns its 10/10.    The last track, In the Presence of Enemies Part 2, continues part 1. It starts out slow, gets faster, and becomes better and better, especially at the very end. 10/10    Although it doesn't beat Scenes From A Memor or Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence it's still a great album. Get the Special Edition because the DVD is really awesome.     Also check out Symphony X's album Paradise Lost. It's another great progressive album. It beats Systematic Chaos by miles, even though Systematic Chaos is really awesome.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|For the price, these are the best on ear headphones I've listened to for awhile.  I'm not an audio enthusiast but for the average listener these headphones will impress.
B000021XS0|5.0|And I'm not just saying it- this really is the best album ever made.    Scenes From A Memory is technically one song so right now I'm going to say 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10    It all starts with Regression: A soothing song that leads into Overture 1928 10/10    Then comes the fun instrumental song Overture 1928. 10/10    Strange Deja Vu is a cool song. Not much to say but pure awesomness. 10/10    Through My Words is a cool song with just the paino and vocalist. Leads into Fatal Tragedy. 10/10    Fatal Tragedy is my favorite on the album but technically the whole album is a song which is my favorite song. Well anyway 10/10    Beyond This Life is a good song. 10/10    Through Her Eyes is also a good song. 10/10    Home is a cool song. It's the heaviest on the album. 10/10    The Dance of Eternity is also instrumental. Lots of fun here. 10/10    One Last Time is such a great song. The chorus is excellent and so is the singing. 10/10    The Spirit Carries On is a song about death. It's deep and powerful. 10/10    Finally Free is the last song and really wraps up the album well. 10/10    Jordan Rudess is awesome. He puts in many cool keyboard parts which really add to this amazing album. I own all of Dream Theater's work and of the 3 keyboardists he's the best, and I'm glad he's still in the band. I hope he stays.
0143038419|3.0|I read this book from cover to cover, but certainly not without some trying.  If you are searching for a read that you cannot put down, then this book is not it, in my opinion.  It was actually tedious at times trying to stick with it, to get on to the next story.  And, although I found the writing style wonderful, I found myself often bored silly, especially during her meditation days.
B0000DI7UR|5.0|This is an awesome album. I really like the solos on it. I'm a huge fan of progressive rock/metal, and this is a great example of it.    Alpha and Omega kicks off the album. Very fast at parts and slows down at the chorus. An extremely well done solo. 10/10    I Walk to My Own Song is very good. 8.5/10    I'm Still Alive sort of reminds me of Dragonforce's new release. 9/10    Season Of Faith's Perfection is the greatest song on the album along with one of the future ones. It has the best solo of all the songs. 10/10    Awaken the Giant is a fantasy metal song. It's cool. 8.764/10    Know the Difference is a good song but it's the worst on the album. 8/10    Dreamweaver is the other best song on the album. It's highly addicting and its got the coolest introduction! 10/10    Liberty is a great song. It's sort of like Come on Ye Faithful by Twisted Sister.    Overall I highly reccomend this album. It's a ton of fun and extremely enjoyable.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I actually bought Sara Bareilles's cd when there was a promotional offer. I was only going to purchase Colbie Caillat's cd but amazon was also offering Sara Bareilles's cd for an additional 10 dollars. So I went out on a limb and bought both. When I listened to Sara's cd I was blown away, I fell in love with her songs. I can't help but listen to her songs over and over everyday. To be honest I'm glad I bought both cd's even though I hadn't originally planned to, I listen to Sara's cd more than I listen to Colbie's.  This cd is definitely worth your money!! Plus she's a UCLA alumni! yay!
0307346617|4.0|Every time I sit down to read this book, I am left with chills.    Max Brooks created the many different characters for each of the interviews of the oral history of the zombie war.    I really like owning this book as I have also purchased a copy of the Zombie Survival Guide, also an enjoyable book to read.    I can recommend this book to anyone that likes horror and fictional historic reference!    Five stars!
B000WQW988|5.0|I just got done with my review for DVDFanatic... This is an excellent release for many reasons. Here are excerpts from my review:    Finally we are able to see the entire unedited performance that took place on stage at Sony Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993. In addition to that, for the MTV-lovers out there, you get the original MTV broadcast performance and a few other goodies.    Though there is a small part of me that wishes there was a 16x9 presentation of this, but I am happier to have the originally shot and intended 4:3 Full Frame aspect ratio. It looks fine, but is noticably from the mid-`90s It may have restotred a little, but ahsn't really been refined or sharpened. Either way, still brighter and better than a VHS taped from TV in 1994!    Available are a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track, DTS 5.1 track and the original Dolby Digital Stereo. I found myself watching the MTV broadcast in Stereo, but pumping the DTS for the unedited set. The 5.1 mixes put you in the room with the band; the subtle roaring of this \\"acoustic\\" crowd surrounds you. And though there is a minor difference between the DD and DTS, it is basically negligable when the music is playing. They are both a mix well done.    An eight-page color booklet inside has more photos (some from the CD booklet) and a page with the show's setlist, players, DVD credits, etc.      Considering what this is (a mid-`90s TV special), they did a great job in presenting a comprehensive package to fans. Of course, one could argue that the entire performance is a bonus feature, but MTV and Geffen opt to consider the original MTV performance the bonus material instead - making the unedited performance the main feature. This is brilliant. In addition to that, you get an older MTV special and rehearsal footage. It's not a lot, but it is pretty much everything you could have asked for that has something to do with the event at hand. I really can't think of anything lacking here, except perhaps a commentary from Grohl and Novoselic. But who was going to seriously cross their fingers and hope for that.    · Original MTV Version (45:37) - The ever-so-familiar original broadcast, complete with logos, commercial breaks and song titles, is actually really great to watch every now and then for nostalgia purposes. Some songs were edited out of order and others were dropped altogether, but this broadcast version is the one that fans have burned into their memories. You can choose a song individually or \\"Play All.\\" The same three audio tracks are available for this performance as are for the main feature.   · MTV News: Bare Witness (14:04) - This is a great retrospective from 1999 made up of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. Fans, MTV personnel, members of the media, fellow musicians, and more comment on the evening. The piece actually does a great job of putting the uniqueness and what made this evening so special into perspective. For some it will serve as a reminder; for others it will attempt to explain history. It's the best and most appropriate featurette that could have been included. Excellent.  · The Rehearsals (22:33) - In this area of the Bonus Features menu you will find five songs from the rehearsal to view. What's odd is that there is no \\"Play All\\" option and you have to select each song individually... or so it seems. Actually, if you select the first song, all others will play in order after it. The collection is absolutely fantastic behind-the-scenes footage of Cobain, just practicing and chatting with the band. It's great to watch and a much-appreciated addition to the set. Rehearsal performances include: \\"Come As You Are,\\" \\"Polly,\\" \\"Plateau,\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\"    Nirvana: Unplugged in New York is a must own for fans. For the first time, you will see the full performance that took place that night, and you'll get to experience it in a great 5.1 surround mix. In addition, you get the original broadcast version, rehearsal footage and a nice featurette on the event. There is no better way to spend $12, so make room next to Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on the shelf and purchase immediately.
0553805460|2.0|I love business/Wall Street books as I work at a regional investment firm.  Also, the movie \\"Boiler Room\\" is one of my favorites and supposedly this is the firm it was modeled after.  Unfortunately this guy tries to be too cute in his writing style and he's not nearly as funny as he thinks.  He wants to impress you with his drug use and his wild life and also manages to get in quite a bit about his business.  BTW, he does appear to be very talented as a chop shop owner/manager and just from a few tidbits you can see he knows the aggressive sales techniques necessary to be successful.  But this book is confusing, boring, too long, and has very few interesting points.  The author tells you what he wants you to hear, then gets to the end of the story and runs out of time without completing the full story.  For example, after going on forever about his beautiful wife and drug use, after rehab they divorce.  But instead of completing the story for full disclosure it's about two pages with no mention of fault or what really happened.<br /><br />The synopsis of this book is exactly the type book I like: true stories of Wall Street.  But this book is hugely disappointing and not worth the time.  I'd take a pass on this one as it's not worth the time invested.
0783225482|5.0|I Loooooooooove this movie. \\"Death Becomes Her\\" is just such a perfect movie. Because, it is funny, clever and incredibly entertaining. And besides, the entire cast works together especially well, especially Goldie Hawn (Helen Sharp) and Meryl Streep (the one and only, Madeline Ashton.)      \\"Death Becomes Her\\" is the story of two incredibly vain, megalomaniacs who each find a perpetual fountain of youth. Courtesy of Lisle von Rhoman (played by the talented and equally beautiful Isabella Rossellini.)      The movie begins with Helen and Dr. Ernest Menville (a very funny Bruce Willis) watching a sublime (and substandard) Broadway performance of an old chum of Helen's; Madeline. (Incidentally, Broadway Shows have nothing to do with the quality of the performance, rather it is a description to describe the number of seats in the theater.) It is soon apparent that Dr. Menville is smitten with Madeline, but he denies it to Helen (his fiance.)     After Dr. Menville marries Madeline (no one saw that coming!,) Helen really goes berserk! She eats herself into an oblivion (Helen especially enjoys those Betty Crocker frosting containers) and has to be carted off to the loony bin kicking and screaming. Goldie was absolutely astounding during these scenes in the movie. Because she totally turned into another person. Not only did she look like a big fat crazy lunatic, but she acted exactly the way anyone would expect!      Fast forward 7 years. Helen has written a book and invites Madeline and Ernest to the release party. Of course Madeline wants to go so she can rub her friend's nose in the fact that she stole her lover. But when Madeline sees how beautiful and young Helen looks she nearly faints! Yup, Goldie changed her look again. This time she was svelte and stunning to look at. Things get even more complicated for Madeline when her young boy-toy takes up with a younger woman!     So, on a whim, Madeline visits Lisle (pronounced like \\"Lisa\\") and purchases her fountain of youth. Wasn't it hysterical when Lisle asked Madeline to tell her how old she thought she looked and Madeline said 38! Did you noticed that shocked look on Lisle's face? And, while this is all going on, Helen and Ernest are plotting to kill Madeline and make it all look like an accident. When Madeline comes home and shoots her mouth off one too many times to Ernest he gets enraged and pushes her down the stairs. It was hysterical when Helen said to Ernest, \\"what part of the plan did you not understand?\\"      The rest of the movie is a competition between Helen and Madeline to lure Ernest back to each of them. Then when they each realize that he isn't anything special, they decide to get him to drink the same potion as they did. So he can live forever and maintain their upkeep (after all, he's an undertaker!)      It was also so incredibly funny how Madeline and Ernest all of a sudden became a loving couple after he tried to kill her. If that's not complete and utter dysfunction, then I don't know what is! And, of course it was just as funny how Helen and Madeline were both fighting over Ernest because they only desired him because the other wanted him! And, it was even more hysterical how Madeline and Helen would say these incredibly mean-spirited comments to each other then act like the best of friends! These two kooks really fed off he each other so well. Like Baby Jane and Blanche Hudson, Helen and Madeline are destined to be together for the rest of their lives!      If you enjoyed this movie, I also recommend: [[ASIN:B00005N89S She-Devil]] and [[ASIN:6305236569 Overboard]].      This movie will put a smile on anyone's face! It's a deliciously fabulous, catty brouhaha from beginning to end!
B000O77V4W|4.0|Whenever one of these young superstars comes shooting to the skies almost from one day to the next, one must inevitably ask oneself whether it's just all hype, or they are actually worth the fuzz. I have myself had a casual acquiantance with Justin Timberlake's music for the last couple of years - after all, anybody who does watch MTV just once every year will have stumbled into hits like Rock Your Body, Cry Me A River, Sexyback or What Goes Around (Comes Around) - and so, when Justin stopped by Copenhagen this year, to play for a whooping 54.000 people, I decided to give it a try, just to see what it was all about. And I must admit that back then, I was quite blown away. Not that everything was perfect on that occasion, but he just delivered a show that left no doubt that this was a power to reckon with, in showbiz and in music.    Therefore, when this DVD was announced, I decided to give it ago - to relive what was a great night of fun and music, and to see whether it could stand the test of return to subject. And I must say that overall, this does stand very well the test of time, at least so far. Again, it's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good, and more important, it's a very honest release.    The DVD opens with an interview section with Justin and band, which seagues into opening sequence and title track FutureSex/LoveSounds off latest CD - which also happened to be one of the strongest moments on the CD, and I must say that here perhaps the show falls slightly flat. I will emphasize and give credit to the fact that the songs are not just reproductions of the album tracks, they are fully interpreted in terms of being played live, and this quite stripped down version of the track perhaps falls somewhat short on the vocal part. I would like more presence of Timberlake in the song - large parts are delivered only by the multi-member back-up team, which is a bit of a shame. The same is true for second cut Like I Love You, and although both performances have allthe groove one would expect of cuts as solid as these, the DVD does not come off on the best footing in my oppinion.    From third cut, My Love, Justin starts to step more into character, but I'll say his voice really starts to shine from Señorita and Sexy Ladies and onwards. It is evident that Timberlake doesn't have the strongest voice in the bussiness - one could argue that his voice is capable, but nothing more than that - but I will say that he does get the best of what he has got, which is sometimes as important as being talented when it comes down to showmanship. The vocal arrangement leans heavily on the backing section, but Timberlake does more than just lip-synch, and I appreciate the fact that whenever he sings, he sings genuinely live, and once he's started does that better than what I would have expected - and he certainly proves that his smooth falsetto is not just a studio-infused feature. Also one should add that he does a lot of movement on stage - dancing, and running (more about this later!), which naturally takes focus away from the vocal - not necessarily a good trade-off in my oppinion, but I guess that's part of the show, take it or leave it.    The tempo is decreased with the unset of ballad Until The End Of The World from the resent album - not my favorite cut of the record, but Justin does a blistering performance here, which is probably why this track has also been released as live video to promote the DVD release on music TV stations. Next up, however, is major smash hit What Goes Around (Comes Around), which clocks in at a whooping 10 minutes and is one of the absolute highlights of the concert. This is one of the great examples of how they rework the songs in the live setting: The song opens with a beautiful piano intro (the man himself at work here), and I must emphasize here the great sound on this release, which retains the full dynamic range of the music as it was played: The piano section opens quietly, and then halfway through drums, keyboard and guitar sets in to form a roaring crescendo. Amazing, and the song has not even kicked in yet. The song proper is pretty faithful to the album version, which is not a bad thing at all, but also adds a much rougher edge with more dominant guitars, and I must admit that this particular track really wow's me. The final cut before the intermission is the funky Chop Me Up, where Justin is joined on stage by name-sake Timbaland, producer, songwriter et al.    Blissfully cut out from this feature is the overly long and self-indulgant Timbaland-tribute-DJ-section featured in the interlude. This was both overly long and bordering on embarrasing, so I whole-heartedly support its omision. Instead we get a short interview with the two Timbers, before going into the opener of second set, Rock Your Body. I should mention here ther generally very well-structured set, which is a deffinite pro of this concert: Ballance is very well retained between old hits, new hits, and new unknown tracks, and the music flows very well, sometimes uninterrupted, from one track to the next.    The major weakness of this tour, however, is also displayed in this next part: With only two albums in his catalogue, Timberlake has only a limited number of songs to pick between, the next handful of tracks therefore moves far into what I consider banalities: The acoustic medley featuring a couple of N-Sync songs (Gone, Take It From Here, Last Night) is downright boring, whereas the dull Damn Girl from the new album is presented in an overly long version, complete with semi-naked girls which does nothing for Timberlakes musical credibility.    Things turn better, however, with the groovy ballad Summer Love and the almost gospel-like Losing My Way - one of my odd favorites from the recent album, here delivered as a sing-along over playback choir which I think is a wise choice, as the gospel singers form an important back-droping to Justin's fragile voice here. Speaking of back-droppings, I should also mention the ingenious scene-design here: Scene is placed in-the-round, i.e. audience is all around the stage. To solve this problem, semi-transparent fabrics are lowered at different parts around the stage, and works at the same time as giant screens for those who cannot see the man (because of distance, or simply because he's on the other side of stage!) and at the same time as emphasize of the light show. In this particular track, Justin is surrounded on all sides by images of the gospel singers, thus hiding him almost completely from the audience, and vice-versa, making a nice reference to the song catch line \\"Is anybody out there?\\". I should also say that Justin does an admirable job in moving around the stage, getting out to all parts of the audience, something which is not a small feat in a venue of this size with a 4-sided stage.    The final part of the set consist of a safe pick of major hits, and nothing to complain about here: Firstly, a surprisingly gritty delivery of Cry Me A River (no mention of Britney here!), this seagues into the funky Lovestoned / I Think That She Knows, which again seagues into a surprisingly gritty, at times almost sonically dirty version of Sexyback. Again I must compliment the man for his courage to rework his own songs, even if they are still true to the album versions, the live versions deffinitely has a character of their own, making this release worth having not only for the visiuals. Indeed, I'm somewhat surprised the package does not come with a CD with selected cuts, like similar releases from other artist (I will take the liberty to recommend Kylie's Fever Tour CD/DVD release and Madonna's Confessions Tour CD/DVD releases, both excellent releases).    A bit surprising for me, when I saw the show in Copenhagen, was the choice for encore, (Another Song) All Over Again. This song never did much for me on the album, but the intimate setting here, with Justin sitting alone at the piano, was amazingly strong, forming a nice contrast to the loud inferno of Sexyback. And the boy sings his heart out here! Since the concert here, this songs stands especially strong for me, and I must say it's a surprise highlight of the DVD, and brings the concert to a worthy conclusion.      OVERALL RATING 8/10    Final Comments:    Considering that the man only has two CDs in his bag, this offers both a very satisfactory overview of his career and a surprisingly robust selection of tracks - even though some of them could have been left out, had one had more material to pick from (Sexy Ladies, Damn Girl, and the acoustic medley comes to mind).    Technically, this is a pleasing release. Sound is perfect, and picture is great - and the editing is not too jumpy, as is often the case in concert movies. I could have gone without the cut-ins of interview snippets or comments a couple of places, but overall nothing really compromising.    On the bottom line, I must say that with this, Justin seems to emphasize that he is indeed a name to be taken seriously in the music bussiness. He might not be the worlds best singer, but as an entertainer, he's on the top.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It would be really really swell if I could add the Mad Men DVD to my gift list and be able to give it to my loved ones! AMC is missing out on a lucrative opportunity by not releasing it in time for the Holidays and that makes me sad.
0439882826|4.0|A stunning display of pop-up art for older children and adults. This is a true collectors item.  One caveat: the pull-tab to launch the battery-operated action did not work.
B000QUGWDS|5.0|SWAT is as good as I remember and the quality of the downloads is excellent. For those of you who liked the series and do not want to wait for the DVD set, this is thw way to go.  They are, however, missing 3 episodes but I will be buyint them once Amazon gets them.  One caution, these downloaded better on my desktop than on my laptop.  In addition, because season 2 takes up over 20gb, I strongly recommed buying additional storage unless you have a huge hard drive with alot of free space.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This concert compiled the best songs of her discography. Specially selected in order to introduce you into a world of magic. You can feel her as if you were traveling by her side around the world. She has the power, the voice, the talent of a prodigy artist.<br /><br />There is no other artist in this planet like her. This concert is more than amazing, and she is the best of the best ! BRAVO!!!
B000002OK3|5.0|The Tarantino phenomenon begins with \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", the film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino which won him worldwide acclaims and gave him his first break.      This 1991 film is about six perfect strangers with colour-coded aliases (Mr Orange, Mr White, Mr Blonde, Mr Pink, Mr Brown and Mr Blue) pulling off a simple heist.  But one of them is an undercover cop and the story ends with the most moving and unexpected twist despite all the typical Tarantino blood, gore and violence.    The film is absolutely captivating not only because of Tarantino's marvellously creative direction but also his brilliant choice of music which creates the most unexpected impact on the audience.  This CD is the original film soundtrack with 16 tracks plus the dialogue.  Well, who can ever forget the violent ear-hacking torture scene accompanied by Stealers Wheel's delightful \\"Stuck In the Middle With You\\".  Ingenious!
B000U7169M|1.0|I gotta admit, the idea seems good. An Oscar winning actress like Hillary Swank in a horror film about the 10 biblical plagues in a small town.  What kills it isnt the acting, its the strung together plot line which comes from just about every \\"B\\" horror film you have seen. There are no big shocks, no big statement about good or evil just a poor script.   When you get to the twist at the end and the credits roll you will say to   yourself \\"oh, please.....is that it\\"??!!! Even for horror lovers of the genre, this one is hard to admire.
B00004RGUI|5.0|Incredibly calming and relaxing. Beautiful piano melodies are accompanied (and not overwhelmed) by soothing sounds of water and nature. My favorite of the Solitudes series.
B000W4KT64|1.0|I rented the 2007 Hairspray movie last night and it bored me to tears.  I started the movie, and within 15 minutes, I paused it, going to the kitchen to get a snack, going onto the computer.  When I finally got back to the TV to watch the rest of it, I decided that I had had quite enough and turned it off.  This movie does not compare to John Water's 1988 Hairspray. John Water's 1988 movie BLOWS this one away!  The cast is better, the music is better, it is campier, it is non-stop hilarity! The cast includes Ricki Lake, Deborah Harry, Sonny Bono, Jerry Stiller, Pia Zadora, and of course Mink Stole and DIVINE (the star of this movie)!!!  NO ONE can play Edna Turnblad like Divine and NO ONE can play Tracy Turnblad like Ricki Lake.  Honestly....no one should ever try to remake a John Water's film. If you have not seen the 1988 Hairspray, please rent it and you will see what I am talking about.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Saw this film twice in one of the few theatres to show it in the United States.  I loved it for many reasons, not just for Mr Butler, who is always good, but for the work Director Gunnarsson and everyone who worked so hard to get this picture made, I applaud you.  Anyone who has anything negative to say about this beautiful film, should take the time and watch the making of Beowulf & Grendel.  Titled \\"Wrath of the Gods\\", an award winning documentary that shows the difficulties of filming a dream, with very limited backing and support. Not to mention the money.     A film not dependent on special effects, but on pure acting ability, and filmed on location in the harshest of climates.  As  far as I'm concerned, it is far more realistic and enjoyable than the latest feature, \\"Beowulf\\" with Angelina Jolie. So, watch the new one for the special effects, but  be sure to give \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" a chance, in its own right.
B000WMEAKC|3.0|After seeing their performance of \\"Apologize\\" on \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" this past summer, I had been awaiting the release of OneRepublic's first album more anxiously then I've been for a CD in a few years.  I literally couldn't get that song out of my head, and couldn't wait to see what else the band had up their sleeves.  Somewhere along the way, though, that dreamy fantasy became a nightmare.      The first time through, as I sampled the first few seconds of each track, I  kept hearing the same song.  Later, when I played each song in its entirety, I got the same feeling: the songs all start out a little uniquely at first, but once the lyrics start, they break into the same familiar beat as \\"Apologize,\\" only set to a different key.    Besides \\"Apologize,\\" the only other track that even stands out just a little bit is \\"Goodbye, Apathy.\\"  The other eleven are little more than remixed variations of the same tune set to different lyrics.      To say the least, the disappointment of Dreaming Out Loud was pretty disheartening to see from a group that is so capable of works so brilliant and original as their breakthrough \\"Apologize.\\"  I really expected more of them, and other true music enthusiasts should too.  When musicians waste their talent on commercial mish-mosh like this, it's no wonder consumers are increasingly turning to places like I-tunes for a more selective fix.  In hind-sight, I would have been better off going there myself, spending $2 or $3 on the couple of songs that are actually worthwhile, and saving the rest of my money for better selections.    While this album, in truth, is underwhelming for a potentially superior group, it is still above average compared to current industry standards (Ashley Simpson, anybody?).  I would still definitely recommend OneRepublic's first effort to people merely looking for something new to listen to, just can't call it a \\"must own.\\"      The real shame here is that the squandered opportunity of real talent mightjust have made a once \\"next big thing\\" band into the latest one hit wonder.  Hopefully, though, the guys will rebound with a more solid sophmore effort if they survive to get the chance.    SOUND:         ***  ORIGINALITY:    **  QUALITY:       ***  EXTRA CREDIT FOR \\"APOLOGIZE\\": *  TOTAL SCORE: ***
B000WGZGNS|1.0|Beyonce let me down once again. I had high hopes for the album Bday and was greatly disappointed. So, I should have known that this dvd would prove to be the same. I was not entertained at all. Beyonce's screaming became annoying and muteable. To check out a real show by the voice of my generation, please buy Christina Aguilera's new dvd Back to Basics Live. You will be ENTERTAINED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009XITP|3.0|Everyone loves the Cinderella story and its variations, including this one where the father is still alive.  However, the movie lacked for any real plot.  The concept of self-discovery (e.g., \\"Baghdad Cafe\\"; \\"Malcolm X\\") can in and of itself sustain a movie, but it's probably not the best device for the early-teenage genre.  That said, I really did like Amanda Bynes as the guiltless, guileless straight-talking American teenager and Fitzpatrick Dar- er, Colin Firth as the stuffy British lord trying to break free from stuffy social convention.
1401200923|5.0|Volume two concludes a great story from Loeb (Superman for All Seasons, Batman: The Long Halloween and Dark Victory, Catwoman: When in Rome, and Superman/Batman: Absolute Power).
B00005JM0B|4.0|Another reviewer felt that the premises of T1 and T2 had been betrayed, because T3 posits that we cannot change our futures.  I agree that it does create a contradiction (if the future is predetermined, how come Judgment Day was delayed by six years?) that would need Larry Fishbourne-style philosophical psychobabble to explain.<br /><br />That said, the film does get many things right.  The directing is top-notch, and casting is great.  I never liked Edward Furlong too much in T2, and it was a relief to see that the new guy was up to the job.  The love interest was good, with the appropriate mix of humanity and steel.  The T-X was outstanding, both the actress and the concept, although she broke little new ground.  The ending was not your usual saccharine Hollywood finish, which was also appreciated.
1563892278|5.0|In the 90s a man named Neil Gaiman came along. He eventually established himself as one of the greatest comic book writers ever (as well as a very respected novelist), and here is where the legend begins. Gaiman created the Sandman--an almost deity that rules the realm of dreams. It is one of the most respected series and I think it is the precurser for all 'adult' comic books (like Preacher, Wolverine, and later Batman and the Watchmen). Gaiman creates an ethereal world that just sucks you in. It really kicks off after it quits focusing on the DC world and focuses on Sandman's world. Especially with \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" the final book in this collection. It makes me excited for what is to come.
B000V1MMLI|3.0|I Got Very Tired of SOAD after Their STEAL THIS ALBUM. Sure, that wasnt a REAL album, but none the less. After that Effort, they lost their flare, their ingenuity and their everything that made them System. Comparisons to System are inevitable. Daron should go Solo, not Serj. Serj belongs with SOAD. Daron should go do a Solo Effort... and let SOAD be just who they are. Im not saying he should leave, Im just saying he shouldve done ELECT THE DEAD. I would buy that Album with Daron, and I would still love SOAD. But I dont love SOAD anymore. Im tired of them. This album, is decent. Its got some ingenuity, some classic System, some played out Political Themes, some great vocals and great musical sounds. But overall, it's a 3. Because it still sounds just as Tired as modern SOAD Albums. BUT, because of SERJ it gets a 3, not a 2. Serj, take your spotlight back. Challenge Daron to a CD Selloff, get him to release a solo effort, the one who sells the most gets the BAND. lol.<br /><br />I dunno.<br /><br />But its definately a 3 album. Some Good (not great) Songs, but the rest SOOOO Stupid and idiotic. No song on this album am I gonna go \\"OH GOD I LOVE THIS SONG! TURN UP THE VOLUME!\\" and then jam out to it. no Song. But it's good, not great. Anyway, you get the point.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is really what made or at least started Jeph Loeb's reputation as one of the great comic book writers. TLH is a very early Batman tale. And Loeb gives Harvey Dent the consideration such a character as him deserves. The artwork is dark, almost filmic.
B000G8NY4U|2.0|This Yanni concert was a letdown.  Should be renamed \\"Yanni's Band in Concert\\".  They are excellent musicians, but after seeing 3 Yanni live shows (and owning the Acropolis and Tribute videos), I was expecting this to be a Yanni performance backed up by his band, not the other way around.  I know there will never be a concert as outstanding as the one at the Acropolis, but maybe he can go back to the same format for his future concerts and cd's.  The fans come to see him perform and hear his music, not just his talented band.
1401207928|4.0|I think it is easy to say that Alan Moore is the greatest comic book writer ever (though Frank Miller might be able to give a run for his money). He created the groundbreaking and master of the literary arts, The Watchmen. Moore's other 'big' creation is V for Vendetta, which is definitely influence by Orwell's \\"1984\\" among others. It isn't as great as The Watchmen, which should be read by all, but it is high among his great works, though it isn't your typical comic book. There's intrigue, darkness and a whole lot more.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Rock and roll is littered with hundreds of bands that have withstood the test of time, but few have grown in stature as much as Led Zeppelin. In the beginning, they were the band that `didn't get no respect'. Today, they are among the most legendary (and respected) bands of all time. In addition, Led Zeppelin must be the quintessential album act of all time. To listen to the band at all, it was required that you buy their albums - preferably all of them. There were precious few singles, so the only real alternative to discovering the band through their albums would have been to discover them through their concert performances.<br /> Most amazing of all is that Led Zeppelin has issued only one `greatest hits' collection - none when they were together and active, and only one since they disbanded. That's it. Let's contrast this with another band. Let's say, the Beach Boys. I recently was asked to review a Beach Boys collection and was appalled to discover that over one hundred collections have been issued by the California pop stars in the past ten years. Compare that to Led Zeppelin! In a sense, Led Zeppelin is the antithesis of the Beach Boys. Zep has held onto their dignity and protected their legacy by controlling their catalogue, instead of flooding the marketplace with cheap rehashes of recycled recordings. The only other `collections' to speak of  have been two box sets, which literally contain their entire recorded catalog, in remastered form...until now.<br /> Amazingly, \\"Mothership\\" is the first official `hits' collection issued by Led Zeppelin that combines selected audio tracks with stunning concert footage, and it is a motherlode. The band has been inactive for thirty years and yet these recordings still sound fresh and stunning. It compiles twenty-four tracks spread out over two disks, and the only complaint is that it could have contained twice that many without extravagance. To complete the package and to enhance the Led Zeppelin experience, a third DVD disk is included which compiles some stunning concert footage culled from the band's ten years of activity. How extraordinary is it that something like this hasn't existed before?<br />Since this is a `collection,' you may take exception to the song selection, or regret that some of your favorites aren't included, but that would be missing the point. If you don't already own all of their albums (or both box sets), this is a fabulous way to discover the band. It also makes a fantastic gift for someone who loves rock and roll but hasn't updated the old albums. You don't need me to tell you that Led Zeppelin is required listening for anybody interested in music. It has taken thirty years to happen, but there is finally one package that compiles the audio and the visual experience of Led Zeppelin. If you don't already own everything, then get \\"Mothership.\\" Now.  A+ Tom Ryans included which compiles some stunning concert footage culled from the band's ten years of activity.

1401200605|5.0|Again, we have Jeph Loeb, one of the greatest contemporary comic book writers. And he shines when it comes to Batman. What can I say about volume one, other than it is great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never caught this program while it was running as a series.  I watched the movie 'Serenity' on HBO.  Was so amazed by the movie that I did the internet search and found the series that predated the movie.  I HAD TO GET IT!!!  If you haven't seen the movie 'Serenity' make sure you get that too.
1563898586|4.0|I love Alan Moore. I think, with the exception of Frank Miller, he's the greatest comic book writer of all time (though Jeph Loeb is fast taking his place with those two). I love the Watchmen. I love his DC work. I love Top Ten. And V for Vendetta is very good. TLOEG is somewhat weaker. He took characters that could be real, I suppose. And put them in this situation. Definitely worth reading if you love comic books, Moore, or the movie.
B000SX9NAC|4.0|A fun and entertaining album, especially if you like 80s electronic pop bands. Many of the songs sound like tribute pieces to various bands of that era (Kraftwerk, Human League, New Order, even the B-52s), and I can't imagine this album existing without those influences. One star off for that, but four stars on for the catchiness of the cuts, the variety of sonic styles, and the witty lyrics.
1401201911|4.0|Wow, Mark Millar ( a 'name' in the comic book world) created a story about Superman. What if he arrived a few hours later? What if he landed in the Soviet Union, and what is it about his arrival there that makes the heroes we know born in Russia. Even though there are some wierd inconsitencies, it is still a great alternate story. It stands alone. ANd it is good.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Intelligent movie from the Japanese perspective, not political, just military strategy. Oscar winner and riveting.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|I've been a fan of Mark Knopfler since Dire Straits in 1978. I've followed his solo career since \\"Local Hero\\" in the early '80s, but he's fallen into a rut. Where are the new ideas, the soaring guitar solos, the atmospheric ambiance found on much of his earlier work? Here it is simply more simply stories of simple lives. Not bad in itself, but we've heard it all before. Mark, take a break. Get some new ideas. I'll happily wait an extra year if it results in a better product. Bring back the magic.
0684865130|3.0|I never really got into this book, and I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about.  It's at least semi-creative, and it is well written, but I didn't find it all that funny.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This film, based on the Elizabeth Gaskell novel, is another example of the best of British historical dramas.  Set in the mid-1800s during the industrial revolution, it provides a perfect blend of historical/cultural setting and romance.  The push and pull between mill owner John Thornton and southern minister's daughter Margaret Hale brings to mind the romance of Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett in Pride and Prejudice.  This is a must see for anyone who enjoys this type of film.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|I've always been a fan of Eminem, from when he made silly songs (see \\"Get You Mad\\" or anything from The Slim Shady LP) to when he made more serious tracks (anything after \\"The Way I Am\\" -- aside from first singles, that is). But Encore (as well as 50 Cent's The Massacre) were so horrible that I almost felt like distancing myself from anything else they did. Thankfully, Em redeemed himself on \\"When I'm Gone\\", as does he on this compilation, The Re-Up.<br /><br />Em recruited a lot of his friends -- some new, some old -- for this album, and they handle things pretty well. Basically, the album seems to be what the D12 albums should have been. Actually, some D12 members ARE here, but there are also some additional guests, like Bobby Creekwater, Ca$his (pronounced \\"cashes\\") and Stat Quo (who appears on three tracks by himself). Em also appears on two tracks by himself with great results: \\"Public Enemy #1\\" (no, it's not a remake) and the album's closer, \\"No Apologies\\".<br /><br />Aside from those two tracks, Em doesn't really show up much on here except for the occasional hyping, which is fine because it's a compilation and it gives his friends a chance to shine. And Bobby Creekwater does just that on \\"There He Is\\", as does Obie Trice on \\"Pistol Pistol\\" and Ca$his on \\"Everything Is Shady\\". And the remix of 50 Cent's \\"Ski Mask Way\\" has much better production than the original.<br /><br />Posse cuts also impress. Em, 50 and Ca$his do well on \\"You Don't Know\\", as do they when they're joined by Obie and Stat Quo on \\"We're Back\\". And most people should be familiar with \\"Shake That\\"; the only problem there is that Nate Dogg shouldn't still be talking about bein' \\"'bout it, `bout it\\". Another dated rhyme occurs in the otherwise dope title track, when Em talks about droppin' them zeroes and gettin' with these heroes (doesn't that remind you of another white rapper?).<br /><br />There are also a small handful of songs that I can do without. Stat Quo's \\"Get Low\\" is his only strike, and \\"Murder\\" features Bizarre being wack as usual. \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\" doesn't go anywhere; and although the remix of Akon's \\"Smack That\\" isn't bad, it just doesn't seem to belong. Still, The Re-Up proves that there's still some hope for Shady/Aftermath after all.<br /><br />Anthony Ruperteing wack as usual. \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\" doesn't go anywhere; and although the remix of Akon's \\"Smack That\\" isn't bad, it just doesn't seem to belong.

0446577391|4.0|Stone Cold is a great book.  I think Absolute Power and Saving Faith were more suspenseful; nonetheless, I enjoyed reading same.  I cannot wait for his new international thriller to arrive in the Spring.
1594489505|3.0|This is an OK book, but the story jumps around a lot. First you're reading about Mariam and then it jumps to somewhere else.
1932100385|5.0|Despite being the most scientifically-based book on nutrition that I have ever read, this book is also amazingly enjoyable. Dr. Campbell uses his own intellectual and personal journey to guide us through a mountain of data from decades of researches. He provides you with the evidence and explain how he come to his conclusions. The evidences are overwhelmingly convincing. Stop eating animal-based food and you will be healthier.     It is sad to see industry PR people trying to misinform the public. The dirty tricks that they employ to confuse people are truly disgusting. It is deeply immoral. I hope they read this and repent.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|The humor is very subtle, and the horror aspect is pretty campy, but overall I found it to be an enjoyable experience, if only to get to see Sharon Tate and a young Polanski. I really liked how he did the background scenery. The movie itself was okay by me, but not to a lot of others I have talked to who have seen it. It's one of those you either like or you don't.
B0007PLLQ0|4.0|I saw the film Legend when it first came out in the US.  I loved the film and thought that the best acting came from the supporting actors, especially David Bennet (Gump), who I saw in the film Tim Drum.  Mia Sara does a great job, and lets see, Tom Cruise looks great in his costumes.  The less he talks the better I say since he's supposed to be a creature of the forest, he should be all physical anyway.  I've had a chance to rent and watch the Director's cut repeatedly over a week time, and while there are parts that I like because it helps the story, at the same time I prefer the shorter cut because there are scenes that just go on for no reason, especially at the beginning of the film. I think they should do a third version, that combines the two.  I prefer not to see Darkness until he is revealed to Lily.  When he stepped out of that mirror it was shocking. In the director's cut, you see him from the start, and in the shorter, the reveal was slower in coming. Also in the longer version, there is wierdly enough a longer pause after the dance but more of him is shown, whereas in the short version, starting with his hand emerging from the mirror, its just abrupt.  I know some people will say poor editing, but that is one editing mistake that works.  Almost like the similar cuts in Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Tim Curry has the kind of voice that simply makes a scene come alive without ever seeing his face, because let's face it, Tim Curry is the best thing in the film, and from the minute he emerges totally, you are entranced and repulsed by his character.  I liked the extension of the scenes between him and Lily.  Another thing, why was it necessary to tell about the importance of the capture/death of the Unicorns so many times, is this for the really slow members of the audience or people who go to the bathroom during films? I had no difficulty getting it from the US version.  The singing, well there needs to be a lot less of of it.  I liked it in the Lily/Unicornscene and the beginning intro to Lily, but by the end of the film, I was sick of it.  I hated that it was all supposed to be a dream to Lily, who I think had farther to go for redemption than Tom.  I hated the longer cut ending because it just had no payoff.  Why did I just bother to sit through the film, if only to have Lily, say \\"can I come back tomorrow\\", like something more exciting was going to happen. You don't have the strong impression that this has marked both of them and made them grow up a little; that its links them together.  No, only the forest people can know that the world was almost lost.  Even though I'm a big fan of Jerry Goldsmith, I only like his score in certain parts, it seems to fairy taley, but not Grimm's Fairy Tales the original(yes, my family owned the original plus the orginal Hans Christian Anderson stuff, it was my mom's) but a more PC version.  I know Ridley Scott loved it from listening to the director's commentary.  I prefer the Tangerine's Dreams music during Lily's dance, the storm and the ending. Also I'm sorry but the film should never be released without the Bryan Ferry song playing at the end, because that song is amazing.  Other than that, I think the film is beautiful and I plan on buying the DVD, but I think I will be watching the shorter more than the long.
0316067598|4.0|Marcus Luttrell's book is an incredible and entertaining story.  I enjoyed it a great deal and was amazed by his recollection of detail, as I often am with similar stories, in the midst of a kill-or-be-killed battle.  He threads a lot of background material into the story, that must be waded through to finally get to the intensive battle scenes.  However, as Luttrell insists in the book, this background is important as context for the reader to properly appreciate the SEALs' ability or willingness to fight to the death, when other soldiers would give up and surrender.  He speaks from the heart, and there is some soul-bearing partisanship and religiosity in the story, which illustrates how he was able to make it through such an excruciating experience without going mad.  Liberals won't like it, because he lays it on the line how political sensitivities exacerbated by the media and liberal politicians' attacks on military \\"atrocities\\"  actually affected his team's tactical decision-making, with deleterious results.      This is a good read and as gripping as Andy McNab's Bravo Two Zero.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly wrote or cowrote all the songs on this albums and the lyrics are amazing.  Don't listen to all the people who are bad mouthing Kelly.  I think I actually like this albums better than Breakaway.  It is more personal and emotional.  My favorite songs are Sober, Maybe, Irvine, the hidden song Chivas, and Haunted.
0805079831|4.0|This book is must reading if only because it so well-documents the pillaging of the U.S. economy by Bush and his cronies.  Still, it does have its lapses.<br /><br />1. Failure to note that Fredrick Pohl's \\"The Space Merchants,\\" and \\"Gladiator at Law\\" so accurately prophesized the horror that was to come.<br /><br />2. Its denial that Bush knew in advance of the destruction of 9/11, something well documented by the FBI and the spy organizations of some 35 countries that followed the FBI for a year in advance of 9/11 as they in turn followed the terrorists.<br /><br />3. Its suggestion that Israel somehow surrounded the Palestinians (on one side?) and kept them from employment or building factories.  And its failure to note that though Saudi Arabia has given the Palestinians millions to purchase arms, it has never built a factory in Palestine or offered a single Palestinian employment.<br /><br />4.  Its reference to illegal entrants into the U.S. as illegal immigrants.  Its failure to note that said illegals are fleeing the rampant corporate capitalism of Mexico or that they are welcomed into the U.S. by Bush as a way to keep down the salaries paid to U.S.-born workers.
1402714572|5.0|I sure hope that kids, and adults too, are still out there reading this book.  What an amazing gift to English literature.  I can still see in my mind the worn hardback copy of Treasure Island at my hometown library.  This is the one book that I can remember reading two or three times over when I was a kid.  I recently read it again to my own kids, and delighted in the masterful storytelling and drama of the book.  The story is complex but well-known: Jim Hawkins, the resourceful son of an infirm innkeeper, finds himself the possesser of a pirate's treasure map.  The benevolent greed that grips the town's merchants who want to exploit the map eventually leads to the malicious greed of a band of murderous and mutinous pirates led by the cunning and deceitful Long John Silver (who would enjoy a second career as a fried fish pitchman).  The single-minded pursuit of GOLD leads all of these men to face the sea, disease, and privation, and to kill each other.  The story ends well enough from our protagonist's point of view, but it all seems quite \\"realistic\\" and gritty.  Don't pass this one over - a classic, richly told and written well, that deserves a place in your canon.
B000W4KT64|2.0|Nothing can compare to the original.  Divine was the ultimate Edna Turnblad and Travolta fell short in his interpretaion of the role.  I thought the movie was watchable, but the musical numbers were long and drawn out.  I fast forwarded through much of the music.  Here's hoping that the remake of Grease never happens.  No one can compare to the original cast of the movie musical!
B000YAF4OS|3.0|The other two Frank Darabont adaptations of Stephen King stories worked out fantastically well on the big screen (Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile) and he does an excellent job on this one.  The acting is fantastic and the special effects are decent.  Also, you end up caring for the people in this movie.  Well, most of the people anyways... there is one that gets on your nerves quickly and who's death is actually applauded by everybody in the theater.    Stephen King said that if the last five minutes is blown by anybody that there should be a federal punishment.  I don't really agree, but I won't blow anything here.  But I will say this... yes, it is shocking but it leaves you unsatisfied.  And I think most people in the theater agreed.  I overheard one guy saying that the ending \\"sucked\\" and I would have to agree.  It wasn't so much the shock value but more of feeling that you just wasted two hours of your life to see it.  So, buyer beware... I think most people will agree that the ending actually did suck.  I'm actually surprised that Stephen King so readily signed off on it.
B00006AW2G|4.0|It seems as if the Stones' early albums each gradually altered a sound or a technique and this album doesn't let down. Either be it the incorporation of a new guitarist or the different insruments, Let It Bleed is innovative and sounds fresh.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|I had not heard much about this movie. I knew that they were doing a big budget stop animation film that was coming out soon. I also knew that Gerard Butler was the star of 300 and he was playing Beowulf. I thought this would be a standard remake of classic literature. Instead I found it to be quite compelling and sometimes very funny. They told the tale with a bit of a twist showing Grendels side of the story and making him considerably more real and sympathetic. Gerard Butler was excellent as was the rest of the cast. Also the cinematography was just beautiful.<br /><br />It may not be for everybody but I didn't expect much and was pleasantly suprised.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Generally when musicians from successful bands do side projects,or start new bands it rarely works. In this case, Nikki Sixx channeled past experiences into a must have CD. The music is very well thought out and put together. The musicians Nikki Sixx chose to work with on this CD were perfect. The vocals are incredible, and the guitar work is outstanding. If there was an option for a 6th star, I would give it the 6th star.
B000J10EQU|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie. I had heard a couple of people that saw it say that it was \\"too long\\" and that it was \\"too much of a love story\\". I found it to be neither. I really enjoyed it and thought it was Superman done the way it should be. Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lex Luthor and the new Superman was dead on. Kate Bosworth was ok as Lois Lane but she kind of reminded me of the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman and I didn't find her to be all that appealing. Also, at first when I saw the pictures of new costume colors I thought \\"cool, they toned it down and it doesn't look as goofy\\" but I must say when Superman was dashing out of the newspaper and pulled his shirt open it didn't have the same effect as the bright colored big red S with the bright yellow background.<br /><br />Good movie for kids and adults!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|She is like Diana Krall, Alicia Keys and Norah Jones.  Very soothing, relaxing, and energizing!
0316067598|5.0|This book was awesome!  It is very well written and full of detailed information.  It shows the very best that America has to offer, and the tragedies that are happening with America today.  It is very entertaining and also gets your emotions going.  It will increase your appreciation and respect for those serving in the armed forces.  It will probably increase your distaste for certain politicians and media groups.
0553381407|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who had or has a dysfunctional family. This book has helped me stand up for myself and become a much stronger person. This book was recommended to me by my Naturapath.

0425179877|5.0|My teenage interest in rocketry, launching about 1000 tiny rockets in all, my dreams of extraterrestrial voyages from reading science fiction, and being involved in real countdowns for liquid propellant rocket motors in the MIT Rocket Research Society all came back from reading this book. This is the perfect follow-on to Chris Kraft's \\"Flight: My Life in Mission Control\\" which came out a year later. Both are excellent. Kraft and Kranz were the guys we saw most of on TV during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo Programs -- more than could be seen of any single astronaut.     The first major Flight Directors of Mission Control of NASA were much more than masters of ceremonies. They had to make decisions on continuing or aborting or modifying missions, and any decision could have led to deaths. Because of the short times in which some decisions had to be made, Kraft (yes, Kraft) wrote the job description for his own position as Flight Director that said he had the final say, knowing that a mistake would be the end of his career at NASA, but also knowing that delayed decisions could kill the astronauts or the program.  This necessitated building a team of specialists for each of the many aspects of the missions (communications, computing, engine status, crew status, etc., etc.) and trusting their decisions.     Kranz was deeply affected by the deaths of three astronauts by fire on the ground in the Apollo 1 capsule. He was point man in the Apollo 13 explosion (as in the movie), and safe return to Earth of 3 astronauts. The details of how thorough simulations of missions were was a revelation to me. It all paid off, because almost no missions ran without failures. On-board computers were too slow or had too little memory, thrusters failed to turn off, all kinds of failure indicators would give false readings, hatches or seals would leak.     Much that was kept from the public during the missions came out. The enthusiasm for the projects was incredibly high among the early birds in NASA, including the first administrators, who had to fight often for continuation of funding, especially after the USSR lost momentum, even to get the first mission to the moon. NASA pay was low, so the committment of so many on the team was not financial. The cooperation of contractors, notwithstanding some lapses in quality, was excellent, and included turning over copies of engineering drawings of all parts of a capsule or component. The willingness to take risks by NASA personnel and others during the Moon progrtam is awe-inspring, especially compared with today's timidity. Fom p383: \\"Lacking a clear goal, the team that placed an American on the Moon, NASA, has become just another federal bureaucracy beset by competing agendas, and unable to establish discipline within its structure. Although NASA has an amazing array of technology and the most talented workforce in history, it lacks top-level vision.\\"     Kranz was aware that he was making history. While he was steady and decisive (like Kraft) while on duty, Kranz revealed his extreme emotions at many points. While you should read books by astronauts, such as \\"Off the Planet\\" by Jerry M. Linenger, 2000, and \\"Last Man on the Moon\\" by Gene Cernan, the best overview for me has been through the eyes of the Flight Directors.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I have to admit, I do now usually like westerns at all. However, with the cast and storyline here, I was mesmerized. Sam Elliott drew me in at first, because he is something else to watch, but Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell drew me in also. I loved this movie so much, I bought the director's cut, and I've watched it several times. It is definately a keeper!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I have never heard a movie soundtrack worthy of buying until this one. To fully appreciate the insightful lyrics, you should first read the book, then see the movie. What you hear is true musical and vocal talent, not studio produced McMusic.

B000VNMMQQ|4.0|but I watched the edited version on an airplane flight. So I was subjected to no swearing and treated to a great film. Lots of action and lots butt-kicking!<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie for the whole family as there is a LOT of violence and profanity.
B00005NKW3|5.0|This movie is hands down an American classic. It must be the black and white version, and it must be this movie not any knock off that arrived later. All performances are excellent and what a holiday message the film bears!<br /><br />God bless Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and especially Edmund Gwenn for leaving us this holiday treasure!
B00005JPS5|3.0|what all the buzz is about! Yes, it is a cute movie and my ten your old did like it but there really much in the movie that had me rolling on the floor with laughter. It was a pretty clean movie but there was still a little inuendo here and there. It was pretty ridiculus. A human and a bee? What? Oh, well, it was a pretty good slice of entertainment but really, all the rave was a bit overboard.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|This would have been a perfect disc if it had included all the songs from the movie!  I noticed that \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\"  I don't understand why these are missing when there is enough room for them since it's a two cd set.  Otherwise I would have rated it five stars if they were on it.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I thought we ended this part of Jason's life already. This one didn't really much to the story. The shaking and whirling of the camera hurt my eyes and made me strain so much that I ended up getting a headache! It was okay as action films go but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Bourne #1 was the best so far.

1582701709|4.0|I found this book to be very insightful and uplifting.  I don't know what all the controversy is about though with regard to spiritualism.  Any one who has \\"faith\\" will realize that these theories can be based on the teachings of the bible very easily.  Because they are not written that way it does not mean they are not implied.
0385473788|4.0|Somehow I managed to reach mid-life without having read this book.  I thought I knew what it was about, and I did, to some extent.  It was, indeed, the story of an adolescent girl in hiding during World War II.  As I anticipated, she gave details descriptions of the realities of war; the fear, deprivation, and suffering her Jewish family; and beneath that, the determination make to best of horrible circumstances.  Anne Frank's writing declares her to be a gifted writer, a fierce commentator, and above all, a normal teenage girl with many of the same desires and frustrations held by my own teenaged daughter today.  Anne is bursting with potential.  An aspiring journalist, she is also and avid reader.  She is candid in her assessment of her male admirers and her curiosity about sex, while quietly quietly celebrating milestones of maturity. An unexpected blessing for me was the poignant reminder of what a girl yearns for in her relationships with her parents.  Throughout the diary, Anne wrote of her close relationship with her father.  In contrast, she was sharply critical of her mother.  Anne expressed vividly how deeply she craved her parents' approval, respect, affection; and how easily parents disappoint the needs of their children.  It is no wonder that this book has such universal appeal.

0060987464|5.0|Like most people back in the 90's, the first time I had heard of Manson was when the cover of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" had come out. I remember thinking \\"Oh, that's a cool take on it\\", but not much else. Then I had seen the Michael Moore doc. \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" where Manson (who was, at the time, being blamed as an influence on the boys who had committed the massacre) was asked what he would had said to the killers. His response was \\"I would had said nothing. I would had listened.\\" Right there, I knew the man was a freakin' genius! Later interviews and Politically Incorrect appearences confirmed it. Manson is deep, insightful, and completely unafraid to speak the truth. He is a voice which we need so desperately in these times in which everyone who doesn't live the \\"American Dream\\" (you know, being born into an upperclass white Protestant Republican family) feel like they have to walk on egg shells. I honestly hope that he stops doing drugs because this world would be a much more conventional and dull place without him.<br />  Musically, it's a matter of taste. I love much of his work. His cover of \\"Personal Jesus\\" floored me. Understand, I love Depeche Mode so much that if Dave needed a kidney he could give me a ring anytime. It feels like blasphemy to admit that I listen to Manson's version much more but I do (every Sunday if for nothing else but to upset the Jesus freak neighbours who put church fliers in our mailbox). His music has a deliciously demonic flair to it with a catchy rock edge that most Goth type music lacks, but the real draw is Manson himself. Like the other Marilyn (Monroe), Manson's personna has always outshone his work. In short, he is one of those few individuals who is famous for being interesting rather than for selling records or films and it is very insightful to read exactly how he developed from being Brian the outcast to becoming Manson the God of the Underworld. This is a great AutoBio and something to inspire the sardonic outcast in us all.

BUY IT!    Enjoy!
0618680004|1.0|I have not read all the thousand-plus reviews that precede this one, but it is clear that those I have read make little or no attempt to analyse what Dawkins is saying in this book.    Essentially, he bases his arguments on two premises:  1. Science should be the solution to all problems.  2. Natural selection is the only unifying principle in nature.    He provides no evidence to support these claims. He makes no attempt to justify or even explain them, but treats them as axioms and insists that anyone who questions them is being irrational. It should be clear to everyone that this is the language of faith, not science. Of course he refuses to accept this, but keeps repeating his premises over and over with a determination that can only be called obsessive.    His conclusions flow from these obsessions. Doctrine and theology do not follow the scientific method, so they cannot be valid branches of study. He criticises them without understanding them, and his criticisms are naïve, superficial and often very wrong.    Perhaps his most bizarre conclusion is that those make a lifetime study of natural selection develop a \\"raised consciousness\\" which allows them to understand things incomprehensible to others. While the arrogance of this claim is transparent, Dawkins, typically, does not try to justify it but seems to think it explains why many people disagree with him.     Much of the \\"rational argument\\" of this book consists of name-calling. His litany of accusations against God - \\"a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully\\" - would be more suited to a school playground than an academic discussion.     His major rhetorical principle is that if you say something loudly often and often enough, people will believe you; judging by most of the reviews I have read, this appears to work. Readers do not seem to realise how much of his reasoning is shallow, fallacious and even downright dishonest. An example of the latter is his insistence that all religions are essentially the same, and so any (real or perceived) flaws in one faith are reasons to damn them all.     Dawkins protests vociferously against people who use irrational arguments and make assertions without evidence or with highly selective or distorted evidence. Yet he himself repeatedly does all of these.     How can he even keep a straight face when claiming that Darwin \\"anticipated and disposed of every single one of the alleged difficulties that have since been proposed, right up to the present day\\"?    Questions that have occupied philosophers for centuries are dismissed after a few minutes' cursory consideration. Looking at Thomas Aquinas's arguments for the existence of God, he deduces that the first three all involve some sort of infinite regress which terminates in God, but claims that there is no reason why God should terminate them (without even looking at the reasons why there is no other solution). He concludes that he has shown the arguments to be \\"spectacularly weak.\\" If they are so weak, why does he not answer them? Does he see nothing self-contradictory in an infinite regress? Or does he think there is some other solution? You can't solve a problem by ignoring it. But ignore it he does.     Dealing with the 1917 miracle of Fatima - in which 70 000 people (including atheists who only went there to laugh when the proposed miracle failed to occur) saw the sun spinning in the sky and then hurtling toward them - he concedes the difficulty in assuming that they all simultaneously witnessed the same hallucination or told the same lie. He \\"answers\\" this by pointing out that it is even more improbable that the Earth suddenly started falling toward the sun. Rather than looking for alternative explanations, he finishes with a breathtaking non sequitur: \\"That is really all that needs to be said about personal `experience' of gods or other religious phenomena.\\"    The confused structure of the book should be obvious to anyone. Having made his assault on God and religion, Dawkins has no idea where to go next. He meanders through a few issues before coming to a non-conclusion. He makes some attempts to fill holes in his arguments, but this only leads him to contradict himself.     Because a universe constructed by natural selection is necessarily blind and uncaring, he believes that purpose is an illusion which humans attempt to impose upon the world, and makes an unconvincing attempt to explain morality in terms of evolution. Yet he devotes much of his book to discussing the supposed evils of religion, using the language of conventional morality: right, wrong, good, evil, decency, vicious, repellent, unpalatable, \\"unspeakable vandalism\\". He expresses outrage over murder, torture, gang rape, child abuse, suicide bombers, and intolerance of all kinds. I share his disgust with these atrocities; but my disgust is based on Christian morality. On what does Dawkins base his?     According to his reasoning, people who perpetuate these outrages are only acting on their genetic heritage, so they can hardly be blamed. If our acts are all the products of mindless natural selection, how can they be good or evil? By dismissing purpose and faith-based morals, he has undermined his whole argument. Perhaps the effect of natural selection is to lower consciousness rather than raise it.    Much of The God Delusion is merely self-delusion. Dawkins has not done his homework. He spends a lot of time pointing out apparent inconsistencies and self-contradictions in the Bible and wonders why theologians do not notice them - apparently unaware that they have written thousands of pages about these very problems.     He does not even appear to have read his own books, asserting that his previous works did not set out to convert anyone. Does he forget that The Blind Watchmaker begins by saying \\"I want to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view happens to be true, but that it is the only known theory that could, in principle, solve the mystery of our existence\\"?    Surprisingly, there is very little science in the book. And when he uses scientific arguments, they are often totally erroneous, as in the astonishing statement that \\"Darwinian natural selection is the only known solution to the otherwise unanswerable riddle of where the information comes from.\\" The meaning of natural selection, according to any good biological dictionary, is the conservation of genetic information by differential survival and reproduction - the information having presumably arrived by random mutation. There is no suggestion that selection is the origin of any information at all. Naturally Dawkins offers no evidence for this absurd claim. Darwin himself in The Origin of Species had no idea where information came from: he finally settled for the Lamarckian principle of inheritance of acquired variation!     His obsessiveness is most evident in dealing with God's nature. \\"Who designed God?\\" he asks repeatedly, as have millions of children before him. Over and he repeats that God would have to be even more complex and improbable than the universe he created. He offers no explanation for such a dogmatic position, apart from saying that \\"The evolutionary drive towards complexity...comes from natural selection\\", which only makes sense if he is suggesting that God has evolved. Yet he describes those who disagree with him as retreating from rational argument. Presumably, since he has not provided any evidence for his point of view, \\"rational argument\\" must mean accepting his word without question. He compounds his arrogance by adding that anyone who does not agree with him is guilty of \\"amazing psychological blindness\\".    Overall, the book is a conglomeration of good and bad, logical and illogical arguments all lumped together in very little order, and many of them repeated ad nauseam. If this book is the best that an eminent academic atheist can do, the wonder is not that religious faith is on the increase but that it is increasing so slowly.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|A circle, or ring if you prefer, has almost come to a final closing with the release of Howard Shore's Complete Recording of the score to \\"The Return of the King.\\"  We now speculate as to the future of \\"The Hobbit,\\" whether it will be filmed by Peter Jackson and whether maestro Shore will compose the score.  Even so, there is partial closure with the complete rendering of the music for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  Comment has been made that J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" may have been the most notable literary achievement of the twentieth century, and that Jackson's film trilogy may be among the greatest cinematic creations of that same century.  Likewise, similar consideration must be given to Howard Shore.  Max Steiner's score for \\"King Kong\\" will always be recognized as the beginning of the modern classical orchestral film score, and perhaps the most influential single score of all time.  John Barry will always be known for his considerable work with (and influence upon) the James Bond series.  And John Williams' mammoth work with the \\"Star War\\" series staggers and illuminates the musical imagination.  But Howard Shore stands alone with his contribution to the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"  It is not the number and endearing quality of themes, motifs, leitmotifs, crescendos, and codas over three films that amazes us (this is not the place to single out particular favorites, though there are many), or the sheer volume of music (as evidenced by the now completed recordings of the three full scores), that leaves us shaking our heads in wonder; overall, it is how intricately Shore tied all his myriad pieces together from beginning to end into one vast and enjoyable, and yes \\"epic,\\" musical tapestry.  Shore has been favorably compared to Wagner and his \\"Ring\\" cycle, but Shore's music is more cohesive than that, and therein is the ultimate beauty of his score.  Much as Tolkien's three books actually formed one epic work, Shore's music is actually one score that exists on a level that is not likely to be equaled or surpassed in this new century.  The final part of this musical trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King, the Complete Recordings,\\" like the previous parts, is an unprecedented musical achievement, and now that we have all three in finished form we can marvel at them, and more importantly how they exist as a singular musical whole. It is a magnum opus in film music like nothing else we have ever experienced.  Howard Shore's full score, like the novel and the films that preceded it, is pure genius.  There is but one thing left to say:  bravo!  As with the earlier \\"complete recordings,\\" brilliant production values and packaging by Warner/Reprise and New Line Records.
1580084621|5.0|I'm amazed that this dude has done anything with his life but written this book.

Great book.

Most people ordering it have probably already seen it.  I just wanted it for my library.  The DVD also included commentary from the stars of the movie intermittently showing you their faces in present time as they talk.  It also includes the making of Goonies and deleted scenes.
B000RSKD6G|4.0|Recommended by a friend of a friend I had some doubts, I like my  fantasy 'traditional'and so much of it these days is authors aiming for orginality and instead producing incomprehencible drivel. 'The Name of the Wind', however, reminds me of the books that got me into the genre in the first place. David Eddings is probably the best comparison I can think of; humorous, unpretentious and very readable.   Kvothe has retreated from the world that has built him into legend and reinvented himself as a simple innkeeper with only his sword, a locked chest and his companion/student Bast as reminders of his past. He seems determined if not content to see out his days in annonymity. That is until a famed historian seeks him out and coaxes his true story out of him.   'The Name of the Wind' is a fairly simple story told in retrospect, but it is told skillfully and that makes all the difference. My only concern is that the protanganist seems overly young to have done so much. I know this is kind of the point, but making him 35 rather than 25 would have made Kvothe's character seem more probable. This is not a major detraction however, and the rest of the story more than makes up for it.   Give it a go. I promise you'll enjoy the ride.

0872863107|5.0|Howl, And Other Poems-Allen Ginsberg *****<br /><br />When originally released in the 1950's Howl was one of the most contraversial works in literature up to that point even rivaling that of Ulysses. Filled with shocking imagry and what some may concider to be distasteful wording and dipictions of overt homosexuality and non-conformity along side excessive drug use and things of that nature. The author as well as other poets were taken to court on the subject matter of the poem was obscene, which it was latter ruled not to be.<br /><br />Many will tell you in todays world that Ginsberg as well as all the other Beat poets were overrated and hyped up to be something that they really were not, well this is all a matter of opinion but that opinion is just wrong.<br /><br />Regardless of whether the beats were 'hyped' and if this poem had not been taken to court there is no way it would have been this popular but that does not howeve mean that it would be any less powerful and well written.<br /><br />So in the end you must read Ginsberg for your self and form your own opinion. But most of the time people who read his poems agree that he is one of the best, and while Howl is not his best work, it is truly a powerful poem non the less.

I encourage anyone who has loved his music to add this to your collection, you will not be disappointed and it comes in a lovely keepsake package!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Of all the Austen books [[ASIN:0141439688 Persuasion (Penguin Classics)]] is  my favorite. Her last book, it also contains her most mature love story and has been wonderfully transfered to the screen in this film. I believe that this is one of the most touching and romantic movies ever made, despite (or perhaps because of?) the restrained nature of the period and main characters. One of my absolute favorites and a definite classic.

Beyonce is worth checking out live.

However, she definitely does NOT mess up with The Beyonce Experience. She sings amazingly, she's got a complete live band (unusual for R&B performers) and a wide array of set and costume changes. Highlights for me include: \\"Crazy In Love\\" (Crazy Mix), \\"Freakum Dress,\\" \\"Beautiful Liar,\\" \\"Get Me Bodied\\" and \\"Irreplaceable.\\" Enjoy the show!

My dad is a huge fan of the beatles, and wasn't sure if he would like the covers or the movie in general. We went, and he cried, and laughed, and LOVED the movie as much as I did. There are a lot of insider beatles fan stuff in the movie as well. Things that you will get being a fan. I cannot wait for this movie to release on dvd. I hope it has a lot of special features. Only problem is, I wish it would release for the holiday season. Thanks for reading, and please go see the movie, and buy the DVD!!

B000YAF4OS|5.0|THE MIST is directed by Frank Darabont; after his somewhat misfire \\"The Majestic\\", he is poised to redeem himself with an adaptation of one of Stephen King's novellas. Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed this horror film that left a smile on my face after watching it in theaters. This film is a welcome return to contemporary horror film-making after Eli Roth's tiresome torture flicks and Asian long-haired ghosts.<br /><br />After an electrical storm hits a small town in Maine, a resident named David Drayton (Thomas Jane) with his son and \\"not in too much good terms\\" neighbor (Andre Braugher) goes to town to pick up some food and supplies. In no time at all, the area is engulfed with a mysterious mist with almost no visibility and brings nail-biting terror to all the people in the grocery store. Trapped inside, some people (with Toby Jones and Laurie Holden) look for a way to survive, while some led by a religious fanatic (Marcia Gay Hayden) look at the mist as a sign from God and a harbinger of end times.<br /><br />The direction by Darabont is excellent. He successfully managed to bring out all the expected emotions when scared folks of different character with different beliefs come together in one enclosed space. The result is a nail biting, unsettling tale of suspense that is the result for survival and blind human panic. The ingenuity of \\"The Mist\\" is that it effectively avoids the usual clich&eacute;s to generate sympathy. The film relies on the emotional reaction of its characters; while it is a straightforward tale of man versus the unknown, he uses character interaction as a means to express raw fear and panic. This is a very effective approach as it preserves the film's premise as a claustrophobic situation and helped me realize the potential panic in this situation.<br /><br />The Mist relies on its effective script to immerse the viewer in the hopelessness of the situation. Sure, it is not perfect. The occasionally snappy banter in the beginning of the film may turn off some viewers but I believe it helps the proceedings connect with the audience and give a subtle background of the town folk. Blood and gore inherent in the film but I think it was used sparingly and the timing/situation is perfect for such things; it never felt as a cheap way to generate routine scares. The screenplay relies more on cerebral suspense than depending on the computer-generated blood and effects.<br /><br />I think the reason why \\"The Mist\\" is so effective is because the terror comes in two fronts of the battlefield. Mob panic and hysteria is promoted by a stupid religious zealot; Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Hayden) who is made as the unbalanced villain. She fashions herself as the light and the messenger of God's word. She portrays God as a vengeful deity who is bent on \\"hellfire and brimstone\\" for all unbelievers. She feeds on a person's desire to be comforted and to belong in a very desperate situation. The second source of horror is the rampage of the creatures that consists of spider-like and locusts-like creatures with almost \\"human\\" features threaten the lives of the people in the store. There are also a few giant-like monsters in the film but I think at this point, the less you know the better. I have to say that the threat of the creatures seemed a bit minor at the time compared to the threat of scared people who is willing to do anything to feed their misconceptions.<br /><br />Aside from the direction and the excellent script, the film's key to its success is the top-notched effects and creature designs. Although the creature designs may not be wholly original, they do look inspired and fit the film's representation of the unknown. The performance of the cast is also worth mentioning. The performers successfully portray their characters with convincing fervor; I couldn't help but become immersed in the proceedings. Frank Darabont seemed to have found the right actors for the right job.<br /><br />The Mist may have strayedfrom the original ending as Stephen King's novel but I rather thought it made the film even darker and unpredictable. The twist in the final act closes the film with a large exclamation point. THE MIST is an effective blend of intense human drama and raw terror that is very effective. It managed to sidestep the usual heroics and replaces it with a beautiful bleak attitude bereft in ultimate irony. The film has a very honest but disturbing vision of human horror.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! For horror fans. [ 4 ½ stars]but I rather thought it made the film even darker and unpredictable.

B000BCE7QU|5.0|This masterpiece has never sounded better -- the remastering really makes the case for Thomas Dolby as one of the great producers ever.  And on the second disc Paddy makes the case for these great songs as standards.  The acoustic \\"When Love Breaks Down\\" is thrilling. Two decades undiminished.
B00000F0D1|5.0|Kathy Bates is a very colorful actress she has been in a lot of different movies in the pass decade.<br />This movies is one of her best, she plays a suicidal ex-nurse that loves<br />the Misery Novels.<br />James Caan is the author of the Misery novels and he just finished the latest Misery novel where he kills Misery off, the character in the novel.<br />When he writes a book he goes to a town out in nowhere and writes the book.<br />It just so happens to be the same town that kathy Bates character lives in, and on the way home James Caans character has a wreck and Kathy Bates saves him.<br />Come to find out the Misery has just begun...<br />A must see, I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B00007KQA3|5.0|This movie was really well done. I am almost always a fan of books over movies, but this was very well done. The cinematography is dark, but that is the mood throughout the movie. The actors were splendidly placed in the roles. Richard Burton's performance was darkly impressive as was John Hurt. Even if you like the books better than the film version, you should buy this movie. It is well worth the price.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It's everything you want and need at a good price.  I'm happy with this purchase.
0143038419|3.0|this book was not what i had expected. \\"everyone\\" was saying 'oh, you've got to read this'.  i found it less exciting and less insightful.  i wish we all could be privileged enough to travel to 'find ourselves'.  that not being the case,  i was unable to really get a realistic feel from this writer.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. very reasonable price and quick delivery. Gets an A plus in my book.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is a great movie, cause it deals with a football team I never got to play.<br />But they were our ticket to state, we were not good enough to get to them<br />in the playoffs or it maybe we were good enough, but we just didn't try hard enough.<br />Out where these people live these people live for football.<br />I remember back in the 90's these 2 teams were in the news alot.<br />A must see, I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Annie Lennox is a great singer.  She brings more emotional wallop to a song than many others; this therefore always makes her CDs interesting and worth owning.  Glen Ballard's production is also excellent, giving each track a distinctive instrumental feel and treatment.  Mike Owen's photography in the booklet and for the cover is also stunning, dramatic and distinctive.  The weakness of the set IMHO is the music.  Lennox's lyrics are as always absorbing and provocative.  However, her melodies this time through don't seem terribly original or memorable.  That said, I do like \\"Ghost in My Machine\\" with its banging piano opening and rocking rhythm and Lennox's driving vocal that brings to my mind a Dylanesque flavor with her swagger.  \\"Sing\\" is amazing for its upbeat lyric and the Choir of 23 star-studded backups with Angelique Kidjo, Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Etheridge and Madonna among others.  The other tracks aren't particularly bad; they just aren't gripping or overly memorable.  Even when Lennox the songwriter puts out an average set, Lennox the singer is going to serve them up so they go down easy.  Enjoy!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|There is nothing like the experience of Beatles Love...if you can go to Vegas you must see it! But if you can't or if you want a take-home version afterwards, buy this cd! We have listened to it over and over and never get tired of it. The music is so great and reminds me of being at that fabulous show!
B000088E77|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. very reasonable price and quick delivery. Gets an A plus in my book.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|This movie was a good continuing story from the first Batman,<br />but I won't say it's better than the original!!<br />Jack Nicholson was the best as a bad guy as you can get,<br />he played the role he was meant to play.<br />Danny Devito does play his part well in this movie,<br />and Catwomen by Michelle Pfeiffer well done.<br />A must see, I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!!
6305696071|5.0|I love the movie Pretty Woman. Always have. Always will. And this special edition makes me love it even more. There are at least two scenes (possibly more, but I've only watched it once) that I have never seen before that are included in this edition. 1) When they're at the fancy restaurant and Vivian puts ketchup on her steak. 2) When Edward and Vivian stop by the Blue Banana to look for Kit. For anyone who is a fan of the film, this is a great buy, and for anyone who isn't, just know that this is a timeless love story that is beautifully told.
0920668372|5.0|This book never fails to touch me every time I read it.  A good friend from nursing school gave me my first copy.  My 10 year old son will bring me the book, sit in my lap, and we will read it together.  I have given this book as a gift multiple times over the years.  I gave this book to a co-worker about 8 years ago.  I recently ran into her at Starbucks.  She could not remember my name but knew that I was the one who given her the book \\"Love You Forever\\".
1594489505|5.0|I've read both of this author's books and although its hard to pick a favorite over the two, I personally liked this one a squeak better. Perhaps because its main characters are women and I am a woman. I also learned a lot about the wars and the countries involved. I missed these characters when the book was over and can't wait for this author is release another fabulous book!
B00005JMXX|2.0|this is quite possibly the worst piece of political tripe I have ever seen. global warming never looked so stupid on the big screen. unless, of course, you see this movie as a joke. In which case, this is actually an enteraining movie with such great quotes as \\"the world is de-salinating\\". the claims in this movie are so exaggerated and the images so foolish that it looks like a cartoon. Tornadoes in Hollywood? Hmmmmm. New york completely underwater within a matter of hours? It just makes you want to never trust hollywood's version of 'science' again.
055358894X|1.0|I bought this book based on the reviews and was unfortunately disappointed. The characters were flat, undeveloped and wholly uninteresting. By page 200, I realized I didn't care what happened to the characters or story and chucked it to my \\"donate to the library\\" pile. Don't buy this if you like stories with well-drawn characters you can relate to or care about.
