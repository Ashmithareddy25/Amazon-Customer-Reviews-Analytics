B000B2YQX4|5.0|I'm a fan since the beginng when I bought their first release(Just Can't Get Enough) on 45.  Since then, I've enjoyed their music.  A dichotomy of dark, even sinister music yet with hopeful, positive leaning lyrics.  A sensible balance which explains their attraction- we all feel the pressures and seemingly hopelessness of our existence/efforts in the world yet we trudge along with the faith that things will someday be completely well.  Anyhoo, I gave this to my 16 year old niece who loved it.  So, irregardless of age, if you like this band at all, you will definately like this CD.  A return of their true talents in their craft; buy it, enjoy it, share it!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This film is a must see for anyone wanting a laugh, while it takes on the intricate but sometimes necessary role of poking fun at the politics, horseplay and irony that surround big tobacco...and everyone it touches.  The scene with Sam Elliot as the dying Marlboro Man was very needed and I also enjoyed Katie Holme's role in this movie.<br /><br />The laughs will not stop as the film is literally an ongoing, witty juggernaut that never stops.  Lots of big name actors in here so please do not hesistate to view it if you want a smart, hilarious film to watch that also has some serious themes as well!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I've listened through the CD a few times now, and I must say that there's not a track I dont like here.  Way of the Fist is a pure adrenaline ride from start to finish.  I can easily recomend this to any metalhead, though if your skeptical, you can check videos for the songs \\"Ashes\\", \\"Salvation\\", and \\"The Bleeding\\" on youtube to get a good idea what they're like.
B000002KHF|5.0|I am excited just thinking about this album.  This is one of the top 100 albums of all time, period!  Okay some people might disagree with me on that, but what most agree with is that Moondance itself is a work of art.  Blends of Jazz, Folk and Easy listening with enough tinges of Americana to rival anything by Springsteen or Mellencamp.  Oh, did I forget to mention there are some blues to this as well?  Again, a work of art and I think Moondance and Into the mystic are a couple of my favorites, but it is hard to choose when again, the entire album is simply amazing.  Despite being released over three decades ago, it still chimes with a radiance that words cannot describe.<br /><br />The Moondance album is somewhat prolific to me when looking at all of Van Morrison's studio releases, perhaps because I do not think he put out an album after this one that could even come close to matching it.  A one of a kind find that I will always treasure.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|First the format war:  Blu-ray is winning. Whether this is good or bad, I'll let you decide.    Now, about the movie - Neat mix of history and mythology.  Visually appealing, the sepia tones lend support to the mythology aspect.  Some of the characters and animals are definitely a bit on the \\"hokey\\" side but add to the overall tone of this flick.  I say \\"flick\\" because this is definitely a fantasy style retelling of the battle of Marathon.  Only the barest attempt to follow history is made, but there are real enough references.  Overall, a very entertaining bit of escapism.      One last note:  Guys, I recommend you spend several weeks in a gym working on those \\"six-packs\\" before you let your girlfriend see this movie.  You will suffer in the comparison if you don't...
B000059TFO|5.0|I will not spend a lot of time talking about this film, but I would say if you have not seen it that you should give it a chance.  One of the greatest casts ever are assembled, and if the awful reality of what happened that night does not shake you, you are not human!  Hackman is great as well as Willem Defoe, just scary and mysterious and historically appealing with a dar sense of dread because it is hard to believe things like this have happened in recent times.  Mississippi Burning is a movie that will frighten you to the very core.  For more information regarding what this film is about, you need look no further than the synopsis paragraph located on this movie's product page.

0618871713|5.0|It's hard to know what to say about this book.      There's something about it that combines accessibility with a lot of raw power in a way that seems to be very unusual to me.  I don't know if that's because of the graphic format, or if it's because Bechdel is just someone who can pull if off.  But it packs the kind of punch that usually comes from much denser books.  On that technical level, it seems somewhat wonderful, even if that's an odd word to attach to this story.    In any event, for me it was quick and easy to read, and almost overwhelmingly sad.  The last page is kind of beautiful and kind of awful.    It's a very smart book, most obviously so in its literary references, but more significantly in its analysis of the events it describes.  And I think it's a kind book.  Not in a syrupy way, or in a superficial hollywood ending way.  It's kind in the sense that Bechdel seems to have really dealt with her father as he was, and she loves him.  Proust's narrator taught his mother not to value kindness above all other things in literature, but I'm not as bright as he was, and kindness matters more to me than it probably should.  The last panel on the last page is important.    I can offer to criticisms, one trivial, the other less so.  The trivial one is that this book perpetrates the myth that Proust is too hard for normal people to read.  It's not true, everyone can and should read Proust.  He's a lot easier than Joyce.  So don't let anyone tell you that you're too dumb to read Proust.  You're not.    The more substantive criticism is a reaction of a friend, who said that he felt that Bechdel's father's privacy has been invaded unfairly.  That didn't occur to me as I was reading the book, but now that he's mentioned it it's hard to dismiss out of hand.    I told my friend that I thought Bechdel had the right to tell her own story, and that this is her story, even if its his as well.  And I believe that.  But this is pretty raw stuff, and I can see how some people would be uncomfortable.    It's pretty great.  Not terribly similar to the comic strip -- it's a lot deeper, and a lot scarier.  But it's pretty great.

1594489505|5.0|More than ninety percent of Khaled Hosseini's  new novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" is a story of depraved human brutality. Only in the last thirty-four of its three hundred sixty-seven pages do the relentless cruelties of the ten thousand plus days of Afghanistan's last thirty years finally give way to the emergence of  the splendid suns promised by the title. Yet, even this glimmer of light is shadowed as a speeding SUV, one of the many such vehicles of over-lording warlords who have returned to Kabul, barely misses taking the life of the book's heroin and her children. It is a disturbing warning that all is not yet well in this atrociously unhappy land.    By the time we reach the first quote from the seventeenth century poem which gives the novel its title,     \\"One could not count the moons that shimmer in her roofs,  Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls,\\"    Jalil Khan, an elite, wealthy gentleman of Herat, has married off his illegitimate daughter, Mariam to a lifetime of assaults and beatings by the Kabul shoemaker, Rasheed, who must surely be one of the most repelling characters in all literature; so much so that one is often led to suspect that he may be vastly overdrawn. But the horror all around says otherwise.    By the time the title quotation is repeated one hundred seventy-five pages later, the light has finally begun to seep through. And yet by now Rasheed has brutalized a second young wife, Laila, and her child and Mariam has been driven to destruction despite the redemptive propensities of her better nature. Even Hosseini's consistently beautiful prose, and it is exquisite as he describes the landscapes of his beloved country, cannot assuage a haunting question as one is led deeper and deeper through the labyrinths of a society made vile by wars and multifaceted conflicts: Is this country beyond saving?    The human story told here in Hosseini's brilliant writing is so compelling that it cries out on every page for sympathy,understanding, and yearning for Afghanistan's salvation. But this poses a danger of over sentimentalizing. We want these characters to be lifted magically from their traumas, their miseries, and their dilemmas. But wishing cannot make it so. Nor can international incursion if the country's history over the last thirty years and before is any guide.     In reaction to the shift of emphasis of the war on terror to Iraq and the resulting fiasco, there is a tendency in the West, and particularly in the United States, to believe that additional increments of military power, redevelopment funding, and so on can right the wrongs of Afghanistan. But if Hosseini's two-generation take on Afghan society is believable, and from daily news accounts there is reason to think that it is, one must ask whether this expectation is anything more than romantic delusion.     Yet hope, if fleeting, remains as Hosseini's younger-generation characters come forth in the latter portion of the book to make yet another effort. Although we can easily admire their aspirations and their dreams and revel in the promise of involvement and resolution, it is impossible to suppress a nagging doubt that the West, amid its own fears and failings, can contribute very much toward the taming of this tiger.
0199267170|4.0|A solid classic version we will use for years and intro our kids to Shakespeare with.
1594489505|4.0|This novel illustrates the many hardships endured by the Afghan people through the eyes of two women. It is a story of love, of hate, of survival, and of the misogynistic society of the Taliban's corrupt policies that governed a society only looking for peace. The reader will experience a roller coaster of emotion as he or she admires the characters' determination to survive, and even to hope, in spite of the surrounding devastation. A great read for those looking for insight into the mindset of Middle Eastern culture.
B000002OR4|5.0|In retrospect, it was probably inevitable that John Williams and Itzhak Perlman should come together in the making of the soundtrack for Stephen Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, arguably the finest motion picture ever made. How could the theme and its treatment do with other than film music's established master and one of the greatest violinists of all time?<br /><br />The soundtrack deserves ever kind of kudos that can be spoken of film music, and perhaps doubled at that. From the haunting theme to its reprise with the harrowing bass undercurrent, Williams has given us music worthy of weeping over. That he has done so in memory of six million souls consumed by the Shoah turns great music into something close to a sacred offering.<br /><br />For a soundtrack there are few tracks--only fourteen--and each of them is long by conventional standards. This makes the listening through them an exercise in sustained and profoundly emotional attentiveness. Each track, from 'Auschwitz-Birkenau' (3'41\\") to 'Schindler's Workforce' (10'36') becomes in the hands of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Ramat Gan Chamber Choir a tone poem of epic resonance and deep intelligence.<br /><br />Several months ago, I wrote with some embarrassment when I offered the highly subjective judgment that Schindler's List is the greatest of all motion pictures to date. The feeling returns now as I say the same, in the realm of film music, of John Williams' incomparable achievement.
B000SW16NU|4.0|This is the second time I watch this movie (original theatrical release), and I enjoyed it more than the first time.      The director makes a real effort to be faithful to the historical and cultural settings.  Unfortunately, every now and then his own modern concerns creep in as distracting, distorting, and ultimately useless anachronisms.      For example, the director goes out of his way to convey his own negative views of the hierarchy of the Christian Church (and/or of religious authority): The character of the bishop of Jerusalen (strangely dressed in white) is useless (or wasted) due to yet another Hollywood movie that chooses to portray bishops as self-serving hypocrites (yawn!).    His portrayal of religious \\"fanaticism\\" (a modern concept) is unbalanced and unnuanced (both within the Christian camp, and in comparison to the Muslim side).  Fortunately, Scott does include the character of the soldier-priest who mentors Bloom's character, and gives him sound and wise spiritual advice.  Unfortunately, the warrior-priest character appears only 3 or 4 times.    There are also some implausible situations (like when the Christian defendors of Jerusalem celebrate their surrendering the city).    I do think that Orlando Bloom was not the best choice for this role.  I do like the guy, but here he lacks the gravitas that the role demanded.  Even his walking looked excessively \\"teeny\\", youthful, like the walk of some surfer boy trying to get the chicks to look at him.  The leather trousers didn't help either.    I'm exaggerating, of course.  But the point is that Orlando Bloom doesn't have (yet) the dramatic skill and presence that this type of movie demands (this movie is no \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", you know).    Overall, there's plenty to savor in this movie.  If we put our imagination to work, we can move past the anachronisms and out-of-place criticisms the director forces on us, and enjoy the movie as if we were right there, defending the city.  I'm looking forward to watching the director's cut.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|What a fabulous set.  \\"Hit\\" has such a blend of music, i had forgotten how talentred Peter Gabriel was.  The obvious hits of the 80s, which became so well known with his videos are just the beginning.  The many other melodies infused with worldwide music make the disc a pleasure.<br /><br />The second disc \\"Miss\\" has bit more of the brooding side of Peter Gabriel.  Although a few of those songs seem to blend a bit-it is a treat!<br /><br />This was well worth the purchase.

0156027321|3.0|This book is good, but not amazing.  Part 1 was entirely too boring for me, and I had such a hard time getting into the book.  Usually, when books don't catch me in the beginning, I give up, but this time I was determined to get through the boring part, as so many have told me that Life of Pi is a good read.  You only need to know a few things from Part I-there's a boy named Piscine, in short, Pi (or in teasing, \\"Pissing\\") who is the son of a zookeeper.  Naturally, the boy knows a bit about animals.  As a side story, Pi takes fancy to Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, though neither of his parents are religious.  Still, they support him. One day the family decides to move to Canada. The ship sinks, the boy survives, and finally an author decides to tell Pi's story.  He comes and meets with Pi periodically-his comments throughout the book are in italics.   The story is told in first person, but written by the fictional author who visits Pi.  And that's all you need to know from Part I! Skip it, please!  The rest of the story (Part II onwards) is certainly a thrilling page-turner and worth the read. The novel goes on to tell the story of Pi and his survival aboard a lifeboat with the Bengal tiger from his zoo in Pondicherry (in Pi's native India).

Arnie died in the book but they never showed that here I don't think, just like Cujo, the kid dies in the book but oh no, we cannot have that on film we have to alter it so we let him live.      Hollywood is such a sham, almost as bad as CNN don't you think?  Just twist and turn it all around and next thing you know the number one news story is about Paris Hilton.      Outstanding DVD
1591840562|4.0|The Art of the Start is a great book because it gives a comprehensive overview to starting a business.  I recommend it to all my early stage and start up clients.  It has a strong focus on raising venture money, which is often critical for a start up.  I supplement the recommendation with my own book, Lies Start Ups Tell Themselves to Avoid Marketing which picks-up on the marketing overview that Kawaski provides and delivers in-depth, step-by-step details on implementing your marketing. Because, as every failed start up knows, once you have the money, you have to produce.

031236198X|5.0|The book is short and the contents sweet.  A copy was loaned to me and I wanted to pass on the favor.  Change is hard for everyone and so is the ability to convince others of the merits of leaving the old ways - even when they are dangerous - to try new ways.  The author used a theme of leadership by successful exploration.  A good story especially for working adults.

B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins , well for me it began in the fifies with Batman & Robin ,  i cut up my mothers black silk long evening dress and made a cloak and mask head gear, wow!!! he live at night climbing over roof tops jumping of , silently entering up on his enemies, my, my it was fun.  Long comes Christian Bale , unknown to me , but he put the part into reality once again , no jokes , serious , dedicated , physically trained , strong and committed . Truly a well put together story , the action makes this the classic Batman. The action and acting of Bale and our loveable Michael Cain fits well together. Great movie, when the dark Knight comes out lets hope the use Bale again and he comes to the call.  Put it in your library,this is the classic.  Luddy

He is an extremely intelligent person and it's difficult to immagine other pianist capable to express the ideas he gives to the young pianists and the public.

B000EYK4KI|2.0|Amazon seems to be mixing together reviews of this product and the regular, unrated version of it, so I will say right off the bat that my review is for the Unrated DVD edition of this movie.  So please don't vote it unhelpful just because Amazon put it in the wrong place!<br /><br />Basically, the unrated disc is a waste of money.  For one, \\"unrated\\" only refers to less than a minute of previously cut footage from the big love scene.  But for some reason, the people who cut this version of the movie actually cut OUT scenes from the original DVD -- scenes that actually added to the plot, whereas none of the restored scenes do.  This is quite aggravating.  In addition, none of the extras make this DVD worth owning.  They should have made this cut of the movie available on the original DVD release instead of giving it its own release.  This was an obvious ploy to make more money, and I'm quite sorry that I fell for it.  Here's hoping my review keeps you from doing the same.
1594481938|4.0|A 2007 summer reading list mini review.    Not since Life is Beautiful have I seen humor venture forth from such an inexplicable source.  In Life is beautiful, a father creates a circus like atmosphere in the midst of a death camp.  In A Long Way Down, Nick Hornby brings four disparate characters embroiled in their own death camps together and turns their lives into a circus act.  He milks humor from such unlikely topics as suicide, teen drug use, severe disabilities, and illegal sexual acts.  It is the equivalent of making delicious lemonade from coal.
B000IJ79V6|3.0|There are only two Superman movies before he Returned, and those were I and II - Anything else is a joke. Let me review the movie and the edition:    I needed Superman II since I purchased the original some time ago, but looking at it now I can really notice the change of pace, tone and respect to the material from the different directors. Richard Donner's Superman I is the grandaddy of all comic book movie adaptations, the standard to follow, and one of my all-time favorites. Sadly Superman II has a more \\"Campy\\", dare I say \\"Corny\\", feel to it despite many of the scenes being planned and shot by Donner at the same time as the first movie. The promise of a Super-men (and woman) fight is central, but the execution falls short with action sequences clearly meant to be comical and kid-oriented. Nevertheless, it is part of the collection.    The Special Features on the second disc, however, are not worth much. Half of it is dedicated to a great series of original Superman cartoons, which I admit were before my time but should have nostalgic value to some. Then the other half is a \\"Making of\\" special as old as the movie (and TV quality at best, with grainy images to boot\\") and not up to modern documentary standards - missing current and new points of view from cast and crew that are not forced for promotional benefit at the time of the movie release. Then there is a 50th anniversary special hosted by Dana Carvey with very lame humor and mock-up interviews which I felt demeaning and a total waste of time. I was hoping for an in-depth explanation of Superman's history in print and film, and/or a \\"making of\\" that went into further detail about the change in direction the series took for Superman II and after. Sadly, there is four-times as much information and high-quality exposition on this movie in the special features of my Superman I one-disc release (which I highly recommend to anyone).
B00005JPQR|4.0|Still mourning the loss of his beloved, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been lured out of hiding after reading articles regarding him in The Guardian. He meets Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), a hotshot journalist who has been following his story. Throughout his research, Ross has gathered up valuable information about Bourne and Treadstone, the organization that trained him. Of course, the CIA won't have it, and overzealous director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) sends out an assassin named Paz (Edgar Ramirez) to hopefully snuff out Bourne and Ross. Of course, Bourne survives, while Ross is killed. It is through his travels that he reunites with former Treadstone intern Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), who agrees to follow in Ross's footsteps and help Bourne out, with his objective reaching the final stages in New York City.    Matt Damon might have been a highly popular actor even before his bigger break in the 21st century. Sure, he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for old chum Ben Affleck, who co-starred in, and nominated for a bunch of awards for, \\"Good Will Hunting\\", followed by two more reunions in Kevin Smith's last two View Askew films, \\"Dogma\\" and \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\".    But come 2002, and the upstart actor made his mark with Doug Liman's visceral adaptation of a hot spy novel. Offering up incredible action pieces w/o CGI to please the summer crowds, while offering up a smart plot that doesn't disappoint, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" was a sleeper back in '02. And its reception gave birth to the equally pleasurable sequel \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", though it was directed by Paul Greengrass instead of Liman. Sharpening his skills since then and \\"United 93\\", Greengrass puts Matt Damon through another rigorous obstacle course as Jason Bourne in his entertaining, if slight, third installment.    Much like \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" succeeds with gritty action scenarios that don't rely on heavy-handed CGI effects that aren't necessarily needed. Whattops that film's car-crashing-into-helicopter scene is a car grinding across a road divider like a skateboard in New York City. To me, that's entertainment. Complimented with some suspenseful cat-and-mouse chases and a crackling good score by John Powell (again, not disappointing), \\"Ultimatum\\" never stops.    I hate to nitpick, but there are parts in the film that sort of lost me. Much like \\"Live Free\\", a film does not have to revel too much in action and violence, but there were times that the film became too rich on exposition and a couple plot holes that I was confused what was going on. For example, a couple of suspense pieces often come out of nowhere. The acting is handled fine (I'll get there, be patient), but Greengrass has a problem keeping up with the plot. Or it could've been the crappy sound system in the theater, I don't know.    Matt Damon is the meat and bones of the film, nevertheless, and his fight scenes and ability to give his co-stars (including a solid Julia Stiles, whose Nicky Parsons character is given a bigger role) plenty of time to work with him are among many things to keep the film busy. Credit also goes to Joan Allen, able to crackle with intensity when sharing the screen with David Strathairn. Even small appearances from Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez, and Albert Finney (as one of the doctors of the CIA) leave a sizable mark on the film.    As far as I'm concerned, \\"Ultimatum\\" succeeds as an action-thriller first, and a political thriller second. With a cast that has no disappointing talent whatsoever, any problems with pacing can easily be forgiven. With a forth novel already out (don't know what it's called), I'll anticipate the days until I get another helping of Jason Bourne.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|I just didn't like this movie all that much.  I knew some details about the Zodiac killer before I saw the movie, essentially that the killer had never been found.  I wondered how they could make a film out of an unsolved crime. And that question is the essential flaw of this film.  One, the film is 157 minutes long...and the conclusion is as I knew it when I started, No Killer found.  So they built the drama and action in the movie around who it \\"could be\\".   Eh, who cares, catch me a killer. And somewhere about halfway through, I just didn't care what Gyllenhaal's character did...I just thought the guy was stupid for wrecking his marraige for nothing...he accomplishes nothing. Am I suppose to feel sorry for him giving up his life to find a killer and failing.  Oh well, I guess if I didn't know the history, this may have been interesting, but I did, so this movie was long, and ended just as expected, very blah. rent this one.
B000O178BY|5.0|I have no idea how Trent keeps reinventing the Industrial Genre, but he keeps doing it with brilliant success. At first listen the cd sounded a little strange - compared to his other stuff. But after the second try and while reading the lyrics I was hooked!    Give it a try, then try it again and I'm sure you will find yourself immersed in the world Trent has created. Not only will you be immersed, but you'll find yourself going back as often as you can.    One of the ten best cd's of 2007!
B000RJO578|4.0|I liked shawn of the dead, and so this one was a no brainer to buy. Well, its good, but a bit long. I really wanted to see how the movie ended, so the story was good, and the humor was there, but about mid movie, I had figured it out and just wanted to see the ending.  The movie revolves around London's best police officer getting transferred to Samford because he's to good, I.E. he makes the rest of the cops look bad.  Well, little did he know he was going to walk a nice country villiage and discover a hidden secret about the population and the smoke and mirrors the town is built on.  Anyway, if you liked Shawn of the Dead, then the humor in this one is perfect for you.
032147404X|3.0|This book has about 200 paragraph vignette's covering a broad range of topcis but there are always key areas that aspiring photographers want to get better on.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|For a long time, I savored the idea of picking this album up and giving it a good, long listen. I thought, oh maybe this will be fun and even a bit mindblowing, getting to hear the Beatles catalog really given a thorough reworking from the great George Martin, the man most familiar with its inner workings...<br /><br />Sadly, not.<br /><br />This is a profoundly unadventurous record, with only one or two real moments of inspiration.  Compared to earlier Beatles mash-ups such as John Oswald's long-suppressed sampling remixes or the Beatles/Jay-Z \\"Gray Album,\\" this record is simply boring and effete, a simplistic pastiche draped around a few good parlour tricks, but nothing to get worked up about.  The mix of \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is a bit brilliant, but almost everything else is rather tame and ultimately dull.  Oh, well.  Maybe a few decades from now, after the copyright runs out, we can really get wild with this music.
0783240236|5.0|\\"The Birds\\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous thrillers, though it's not always regarded as one of his best. The humans are often thought to be less interesting than the feathered beasts who wreak havoc on the town of Bodega Bay. But the special-effects are remarkable even in these more modern times when computer technology has rendered some of Hitchcock's techniques obsolete.<br /><br />The humans may be overshadowed by the birds, but they provide some of the best moments. The scene at the diner following the attack on the school is one of the highlights. As 'Tippi' Hedren discusses the attack on the phone with her father, the others gathered for lunch are skeptical, especially Mrs. Bundy (wonderfully played by Ethel Griffies) whose avocation is the study of birds.<br /><br />\\"Their brainpans aren't big enough,\\" she says in explaining why birds lack the intelligence to launch the organized attack that Hedren describes.<br /><br />\\"I don't know anything about their brainpans,\\" Hedren says.<br /><br />\\"Well, I do,\\" Mrs. Bundy declares, \\"I do know.\\" Mrs. Bundy is a minor character, but she steals the show during her brief scenes.<br /><br />Hitchcock also knew that the anticipation of horror can be more frightening than the actual thing. The attacks themselves are less effective than the moments preceding them. Even a simple scene like the one in which Rod Taylor looks with curiosity upon the birds lined up on a telephone wire as he says goodbye to Hedren conveys anxiety, as does the moment when a bird crashes into Suzanne Pleshette's door. The best moment is the scene outside the school where Hedren waits, unaware that another attack is imminent.<br /><br />\\"The Birds\\" was a box-office hit when it opened in spring 1963, and it would shatter previous viewing records when it made its television debut on NBC five years later. It was also the great director's final cinematic triumph. The films he had left to make (\\"Marnie,\\" \\"Torn Curtain,\\" \\"Topaz,\\" \\"Frenzy,\\" and \\"Family Plot\\") all have points of interest, but their quality is sporadic, and none are as satisfying as the film that Hitchcock once described as an allegory on judgment day.<br /><br />Brian W.

1594489505|5.0|This is probably the best book I've read all summer. I simply could not put it down! I actually felt like I was seeing through the eyes of the main characters in this story. I can't even begin to relate to all the emotions I felt as I read each chapter, and some of the horror of what living in civil war and poverty must be like. The thought that women are still hideously abused in the ways described in the book sickens me. I can't imagine having to live through what these two characters lived through day in and day out, with little to no hope of ever finding happiness. It makes me feel greatful to be a women living in the USA...
0143038419|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I thought it was extremely well written.  I could easily envision the places that the author was visiting and the emotions that she was feeling.  Her struggle to quiet her mind is one to which I think most people can relate.    It started out as a great, easy read but it did become slightly arduous during her stint in India. I don't know if this was intentional because she was facing challenges while she was there-- if so, I could feel her pain.    There are some great lines throughout the book, again a testament to the author's writing ability.    If you are at a point in your life where you are trying to regain control, redirect yourself and focus, this is an exceptional book.  If not, you might find it selfish and trite.    I liked it, was happy to have read it, but I don't feel as strongly about it as a number of the reviewers.  It wasn't particularly life changing for me, but rather life affirming and an excellent reminder that stillness is a good thing and living as your true self is essential to finding inner peace.  I did find myself jealous of her ability to take a year to travel and be selfish.      I could see how the book could be extremely impactful if you were at a fork in the road or feeling unfulfilled.  If you're cyncial, think God looks like George Burns, and peace is only achieved by hard labor, you will hate this book and curse the author.
B000083C49|5.0|This is the best Star Trek movie with the original cast by a considerable margin. You can view this film on two levels. Firstly the central premise of the plot in the film sends a strong environmental message. That is that if we keep messing the planet up, we could be in serious trouble down the line. Twenty years after this film was made, this seems to be truer now than it ever was.<br /><br />However, don't let the above put you off (whatever your view on environmental issues) because secondly as a piece of entertainment this a great film. Kirk, Spock, Bones and the other main characters all get ample opportunity to show why Star Trek became so successful. Theres a lot of humour in this film which works really well. Kirk having no understanding of exact change only on a bus. Spock when asked if he's sure he won't change his mind replies \\"is there something wrong with the one I have\\".<br /><br />So effectively its a classic episode of the original series, given a big budget, better special effects (although starting to look dated now) with a classy script. It is certainly worth buying as this is a film that supports repeated viewings. There are a lot of extras on the special edition (6 hours +) that make this much preferable to the standard release.
1590171993|5.0|Reading this book is like watching invisible ink of psychic life  become visible.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is a great and very funny film. A case of mistaken identity leads Jeff Bridges 'Dude' into all sorts of problems. The Dude is extremely laid back (stoned a lot) - the Coens wrote the part for Jeff Bridges.<br /><br />A number scenes standout, but the Bowling Alley ones are particular favourites of mine. The cast are fantastic, and for me John Goodman as Vietnam Vet Walter just steals the acting honours. Walter is obsessed with Vietnam, to the point where he introduces Vietnam into any conversation regardless of whats being talked about. One of the very last scenes is an extremly funny example of this.<br /><br />I've lent the film to a lot of people and there is a split with this film between those that love it and those that really don't get it. So if you're unsure catch it on TV or rent it. If you like it you will have to buy it and watch it again very quickly.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|Everything about this movie was great, really good story line, excellent sound and picture quality. I recomend it to anyone who owns a HD DVD player.
B000059TFO|5.0|I saw this film at a cinema in south London when it first came out. It was a hot day, the cinema had no air conditioning, and it was like the deep south. I don't know how many times I've seen the film since, but I've rented it, bought the video, bought the DVD and watched it on television - so a hell of lot.<br /><br />Despite these repeated viewings it never loses its power and that comes from two things. Firstly its subject matter and secondly from a powerhouse performance by Gene Hackman. Willam Dafoe, Frances McDormand and the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent - Hackman is better.<br /><br />Loosely based on a true event in the 60's, it concerns the dissappearance of two human rights activists. The opening to the film is one of the most tense and memorable scences(and Hackman isn't even in it). Dafoe and Hackman do a variation on the good cop, bad cop routine with bad cop tactics being the final strategy!<br /><br />Its a great film, which if you haven't seen, you should do so now.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I enjoyed Solaris. It isn't a film for everyone and I don't think it tries to be. The pacing is good - nice and slow! Just the way I like it! Too many films seem to want to rush me to some place before I have had a chance to really engage with the visions, sounds, words, music and ideas inside the film. Solaris did give me a bit of breathing space in this respect.<br /><br />It is a very handsome film and the special effects, although modest in comparison to some recent science fiction films, are effective.<br /><br />In some respects this film is really a fantasy rather than a science fiction - it deals with a very strange \\"what if?\\" and this question is not about technology, society or man's relationship with his artefacts and machines. It also looks at some psychological reactions.<br /><br />I was only disappointed by the fact that we were give so little information about the apparently sentient planet, Solaris. Surely, the people would have gained some information about this strange object?<br /><br />The quiet, ambient music composed for this film was particularly good and I wholeheartedly recommend the soundtrack. It contains some of the most mysterious and beguiling ambient music I've heard.

B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is an impressive faced paced sci-fi/action film that had a pretty small budget, but the enthusiasm of first time director Cameron and the cast elevated this film far above and beyond it's hokey sci-fi origins. If you are not familiar with this film by now......what are you waiting for? This special edition released in 2001 has a nice DVD transfer and some very interesting extras included deleted scenes and commentary, a couple of feature-ettes(one a few years after the films released and one many years later). There are some cool trailers and TV spots, plus a copy of the original script. After watching the extras I had a new appreciation for the film and realized just how far enthusiasm can take a project. Arnold may not be a great actor(especially at this time), but his presence is certainly a big part of what makes this unstoppable cyborg work so well for this film. Hamilton turns in a very good performance as Sarah Conner and also adds depth to this heart pumping thriller!
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I would've bought it. The comments inside the review are worthtaking. Unfortunately, today's controversy about global warming (if ever exists), made change my mind. I was hoping to have a back-up to show my kids about the wonders of this planet, an overview, without hearing the same pathetic comments about the \\"endangered species\\". Dinasours are extinct because of natural selection, so are the actual life beings. Illegal hunting for instance, that is important to mention, a real fact. Global warming isn't been demonstrated.
B00004W221|5.0|I know many feel this movie is manipulative, but I like this movie a lot! The story is inspiring and the acting is very good. Sean Astin is perfect in the role of \\"Rudy\\"! Is it just another sports movie? No! It's a story about working hard to get want you want without stepping over people to get there! It's just a great flick! If your not welling up by the time Rudy is over you don't have a pulse! The DVD transfer looks very good!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I will start with the one good thing about the bond movie, that is that the credits are still a good measure as to how well the movie will be.  I found the opening credits to be boring and choppy which is how the movie ran its self.  Bond was sloppy, clumsy and uncouth which is the opposite of what you would expect bond to be like.  Then the fact that he passes up several opportunities to be with the girl which is so un-bond like I mean bond is supposed to move in, be smooth, get the job done and shag the girl.     I wished I could at least say this was a decent action film, but the fights were sloppy, slow, poorly shot, and not very exciting.    That brings us to the story line or i guess that is what they would call it.  I would recommend that the writers use the Dramatica software and it would fix most of the elementary mistakes made by the writers  [[ASIN:B00004TYCR Write Brothers Dramatica Pro 4 (Win/Mac)]]I hate to say it but this movie was as bad as Doom which is my lowest rating :(  DON'T WATCH IT SAVE YOUR TIME        BEWARE!!!!!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Even though I was a child, I distinctly recall the news coverage of the Zodiac killer manhunt nearly forty years ago, which served as the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's epochal film, 1971's [[ASIN:B00005NTNV Dirty Harry]]. David Fincher's meticulous 2007 film, however, is not a standard action shoot-`em-up. In tone and pacing, it seems to have been inspired by Alan J. Pakula's [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men]] (1976). Both movies take on the guise of a suspenseful, character-rich detective story that highlights the obsession that takes over the police and the press in uncovering high-profile crimes. Unlike Pakula, however, Fincher does not propel James Vanderbilt's time-spanning script (based on Robert Graysmith's 1986 book, [[ASIN:0425212181 Zodiac]]) as forcefully and lets the story go on far too long to be consistently compelling, especially as he is forced by facts to leave the resolution open-ended.<br /><br />The story traces three main protagonists over several years - San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi and two of the staff at the San Francisco Chronicle, veteran crime beat reporter Paul Avery and young cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith. It is ironically Graysmith who is the most tenacious in finding the murderer as the encrypted letters sent to the newspaper offices feed into his natural interest in puzzles. As one would expect from the maker of [[ASIN:B000050FEN Se7en]] and [[ASIN:B000067J1H Fight Club]], Fincher does not shy away from the details of the graphic killings, but the movie is far more about the frustrating pursuit by the three men separately and together. The cat-and-mouse tension works best albeit most predictably when Toschi and his fellow law enforcement officers are involved. The journalistic pursuit is comparatively less interesting because Avery's self-destructive tendencies and Graysmith's mounting preoccupation do not measure up dramatically to the palpable idea of the killer being caught and punished by the law.<br /><br />Typical of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike. Playing a character that inspired not only Eastwood but Steve McQueen's [[ASIN:B0008ENHTE Bullitt]], Mark Ruffalo lends his familiar ramshackle persona to the sardonic character of Toschi - more like Columbo than Callahan. As the alcoholic, drug-addled Avery, Robert Downey Jr. shows an obvious affinity to his character, and he makes the most of it, even if it all feels a little too familiar. Jake Gyllenhaal grabs the most screen time and provides an effective portrait of Graysmith as he evolves from naïve and impressionable to haunted and indiscriminately desperate. Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chloë Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.<br /><br />The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple filmmaking style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike.

Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chloë Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.    The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple filmmaking style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.
0375847227|5.0|I am reading this book right now, nearly done with the Golden Compass (the first of the trilogy).  Unfortunately, this has resulted in some late nights the past several days, and my wife and daughter have begun to give hints that they are feeling neglected.  It is that good!<br /><br />I started to read it to my daughter, who is five... however I stopped after the first page or two.  There was talk of poisoning and killing, and other subjects I decided were too adult for her.  I am glad I stopped reading to her:  this can be a very dark book.  HOWEVER, it is amazing and delightful, filled with amazing scenes and intrigue and danger.  I can't wait for the movie!<br /><br />My suggestion is to pick this volume up.  The trilogy has some of the same characters in it, and details their ongoing adventures in their world and others.  Additionally, Pullman apparently has written material at the end of each book explaining things.  As I wrote earlier, I haven't finished the first book as of yet so I can't tell you the quality of the additional materials.  Either way the first story alone is worth the purchase price.<br /><br />Update 08-25-07:  I am nearly done with the third book in the trilogy.  It is the most amazing thing that I have ever read.  Whew!  I read somewhere that Niccole Kidman and the new James Bond (I can never remember his name) have signed on for the movie versions of the final two books in this series. I would like to see how Hollywood does with Pullman's incredible work.  But, you may have some reservations after reading the rest of my review below.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  And a warning...<br /><br />The one gripe that I have is this:  Besides the murder of children, and all the other dark stuff (I still can't believe this is a kid's book!) which I find terrible, it is really not kind to what I consider my core beliefs, which is God and Christ, and the Catholic church.  The Catholic Church isn't mentioned by name (they call it The Church), but there are priests and angels and a war against The Authority which they also call God / I AM, Yaweigh, etc.<br /><br />The theory behind this book is that God didn't make the universe.  He came after and basically took credit.  All the terrible things out there are his creation, and the first rebellion were good angels who were fed up with His ruling.  The church is bad.  They send a murderous priest after the children/ heroes.  The church is also behind the murders of other children.  They are doing terrible things in the name of God.<br /><br />The funny thing about it is the other side, the side that's fighting against the Authority, really isn't all that nice either.  In fact, they are also doing terrible things!<br /><br />Everything is building up to one knock down drag out fight for the ages.  It honestly makes Harry Potter sound like a bad barroom brawl.<br /><br />So, there you have it... as a parent, is this something you want your children to be exposed to?  Do you want to expose yourself to this?  I think I'll wait several years until my daughter is able to understand the weighty and controversial words that Pullman has written.  And in the meantime, I'll continue reading.inst The Authority which they also call God / I AM, Yaweigh, etc.      The theory behind this book is that God didn't make the universe.

B00005ND42|4.0|I'm not a student of classical music, just a fan. With that said, I would definitely recommend this CD, as it's a great introduction to all of the piano and violin sonatas. Previously, I was only familiar with \\"Spring\\" and \\"Kreutzer\\", played with a little more energy and attitude, but I am very much enjoying this \\"translation\\" of those two sonatas, and really revelling in getting to know all of the other sonatas. It's a joy to have them all in one CD set, and being able to hear the progression of composition over the years. I very often go to sleep nights now listening to CD 1.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Sum 41 and out of all of their albums, this is by far the best in my opinion. We do see more diversity in the bands sound and lyrics. This album definitely has a lot of political opinions, which I'm not too into, but it doesn't overwhelm the album like some bands tend to do with their political views.     Some key tracks to check out:    Walking Disaster  March of the Dogs  With Me (or Best of Me)  Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times

B000RJO578|5.0|...it gives me a reason to watch all the boneheaded action movies it references/parodies so I can fully appreciate the inside jokes my friends got that I didn't.  (Not that my friends are boneheads...)  However, the excellent bonus features include the whole movie with on-screen \\"Fuzz Facts\\" detailing every movie reference, and packed with trivia detailing the filmmaker's research on everything from police jargon to the Japanese Peace Lily.     At first I thought \\"Hot Fuzz\\" was not as good as \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  I was wrong.  This is brilliant.  I attribute the error to my personal preference for zombies as opposed to police officers.  (Damn.  There go any \\"helpful\\" votes from police officers...)  If you're reading this you don't need me to tell you what the film is about or why it's funny.  I just hope we see more from Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright soon.    Other bonus features include--and I actually wondered about this--the other side of Danny's gory flip/cartoon notebook!  As well as hilarious outtakes and deleted scenes, and a featurette on Pegg/Wright/Frost's U.S. publicity junket for the film.  Great job all around, the DVD as well as the film itself.
0375423966|4.0|I was really expecting the film that came out of this book and I have finally seen it. It is one of the greatest disappointments I have lived in a movie-theater for quite a while, all the more because I was expecting a lot from it. But I should have known better. The subject is too serious to be treated so lightly, yes lightly. What are her father and mother doing in Iran for them to have that much money, that comfort if not luxury, that durability that enables them to survive all regimes, all revolutions, all coup d'etat, when it is not simple religious putsches, and where did they get the money to enable her to live for several years in Vienna? The whole film becomes a collection of clich&eacute;s, most of them purely existential. Let me give a couple. Clich&eacute;, the quotation of Lenin or Bakunin or some other names that bring nothing to the mind. Clich&eacute;, her boyfriend in Vienna who discovers he is gay and the relation is finished because of it: you have to be seriously concentrating on sex and only sex to make friends with someone and drop him as soon as he discovers himself unable to fulfill the sexual part of the relation. What about his personality, his originality? What about love and friendship in all that? Then the next one is seen in two directions and each one is a clich&eacute;: on one side he is a saint who ends up in bed with another girl; on the other side he is a monster who exploited the girl all along. She sure was a sucker and a dummy. But what does it bring to the film, to the story, to the ideas the film conveys, if it conveys any articulated idea? The point is not to say that the West sold weapons to both Iran and Iraq. That's normal since we are in a market economy and business is business: if I don't sell my weapons, my neighbor will sell his. So, what must I do? After all a French exocet missile was very effective in the Falkland Islands war in the 1980s ... against the English. If Kellog refuses to sell his corn flakes to me, I will buy the corn flakes of any other brand. But what were the causes of this war? Why did Iran and Iraq manage to start a war between them two instead of finding a normal solution through discussions and negotiations? The film seems to express some kind of nostalgia for the good old days when there were two clear cut sides. Unluckily the old USSR has disappeared, but not one word about the support Iran provided, along with the CIA among others, to the anti-soviet fighters in Afghanistan. This film is simplistic but it deals with extremely important issues, so it does not have the right to be that simplistic. Politics cannot be reduced to that superficiality. And the future of Iran is not in Paris. It is Tehran.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneill buy the corn flakes of any other brand.

0156027321|4.0|This was one of the most thoroughly and consistently engrossing books I've read in a long time, regardless of the fact that the majority of it takes place aboard a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I always was a sucker for \\"survivor\\" type stories, anyway.<br /><br />Although I felt that the ending was appropriate, the momentary lapse into morbidity seemed a little incongruous and sort of prevented me from giving this book the full five stars that I otherwise felt it fully deserved. Perhaps I am being unfair. It's likely.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend it. It's a fairly easy read and almost entirely enjoyable from start to finish.
B000BYRCH4|1.0|People are giving this movie waaaay too much credit. So it has Jessica Alba in it. So what. If I wanted to see a beautiful body I'd pick up a copy of my roommate's Maxim magazine. The gorgeous ocean shots? Well... it reminded me that I really need to subscribe to National Geographic already. While those two features made the movie vaguely tolerable, I'm certainly not going to applaud it for it and bestow pity stars upon it.     There is so little actual plot in this movie that they had to resort to long, pointless shots. The ones that stick out in my mind are when we see the two main characters frolicking in the ocean in the beginning of the movie for just around five minutes. At least that one was kind of visually appealing. Later on there is a party scene and I swear we fast-forwarded through at least two minutes of pointless parying. Not even the punches thrown really factor into the ending at all.    The characters are completely shallow and one dimensional. The only reason I was rooting for the main character was because Sam liked him. Otherwise he could have died and I would not have minded one iota. The only real reason I cared about Sam was because she was the beautiful Jessica Alba. (Although her consistent refusal to ignore her morals was pretty endearing also... although I found myself disappointed when she came back. Or, more accurately, at the reason she came back.)    The acting is basically atrocious.... although I suspect that considering the awful dialog that was written for them it would have been hard to come across as realistic. Sadly, the film would have probably actually WORKED best as a silent film... the plot was simplistic enough that it could have been conveyed without actual dialog. Just give us the kind of bar piano that accompanies the Charlie Chaplain silent films and I could almost see this becoming a three star work of art.
B000K7VHQ4|1.0|I have always held Edward Norton for being an entertaining actor to watch. In reality, he has participated in a couple of good movies the rest have been forgetable. The Illusionist, however, is just BAD, a WASTE of MONEY. Jessica Biel, oh goodness, she is part of the new homogenized young Hollywood without depth, soul, sincerity, or conviction. She was barely good enough on TV and the big screen only highlights her shortcommings. Her accent? ridiculous. She is not a period actress, this would require actual skills which she does not possess. The story is bad as well.There is no character development. The editing is horrible. I felt completely disastisfied at the end of this film. Do not WASTE MONEY or TIME on this film.
0743454537|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult, and I can honestly say it is one on the best books I have ever read! My Sister's Keeper is beautifully written and told from a variety of viewpoints. The topic is gripping...I couldn't put this book down! I am writing this review at 1:45am because I couldn't stop reading until I was finished. I am an avid reader, and look forward to reading more of Jodi Picoult's books in the future. I cannot wait to pass this book on to my friends so they can also enjoy it!
B000002J09|5.0|Let's hear it for The Battle of Evermore, one of many underrated songs by Led Zeppelin.  That song is beautiful, and everyone skips over it.  Stop that!<br /><br />Oh, and the other songs are good, too....
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I have purchased more than 100 titles on Blu-ray Disc, and can say with confidence that the picture quality and sound on 300 are excellent. I hear that the HD DVD version has some different extras on it, but I didn't even watch all of the extras on the Blu-ray version. With the Blu-ray costing less, that's the way to go in my opinion. The lossless audio is fantastic. Definetly a 5-star title.
B000AP04FG|2.0|It never ceases to amaze me how many hollywood movies of the 2000s that you could reasonably expect to be at least generically entertaining turn out to be downright poorly written and/or edited. The bits of the couple talking to the marriage counsellor is like a subpar tv dramedy, and most of the actual plot is either boring or makes no sense. The two meet in a Cambodian warzone but both believe each other have innocuous American jobs? Then they're simultaneously carrying out assassinations, but telling us who they're killing or why is apparently not as important as highlighting the masterful strategies they employ to get the job done: Pitt cleverly impersonating a drunk to get his targets defences down and Jolie impersonating a dominatrix. This isn't fun, it's just dumb. After enduring those 25 minutes the movie finds it's feet with a few inventive action sequences but still leaves a trail of unanswered questions and sets character logic as an unacceptably low priority.
B000RJO578|4.0|This film has such a funny light heart that it can make some amazingly gross violence seem innocuous and quite funny.  I am not sure how it is pulled off, but, really, it is FUNNY.  It is a British film so you might have a slight accent problem (I do not) and you will have to get used to the driver being on the opposite side of the police car than you expect.  But other than some turns of phrase, the movie takes on the cop genre in a way that is thoroughly understandable to anyone who has ever seen a cop film or show.<br /><br />Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a stereotypical supercop.  He has never wanted to be anything else, passed the schooling with superb scores (a double first in British terminology), and has racked up a tremendous and heroic record on the force.  His reward?  Being sent to a bucolic village far from anything requiring the kind of police work Nicholas has ever cared to do.<br /><br />But we all know that villages are not always as they seem, right?  I don't want to talk about the movie's plot because it isn't particularly difficult to figure out, but going through the parody is much more fun  than having it described to you is.  Sgt. Angel's partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is terrific (Frost and Pegg are friends and often work together).  The movie uses every, and I mean EVERY cop show clich&eacute; and makes them all fun.  Just be willing to put up with a bit of swearing (there is a swear box to raise money for the church roof, after all) and some amazing violence.  Timothy Dalton plays a terrific slimeball named Simon Skinner.  Jim Broadbent, whom I always love on screen, is superb as Inspector Frank Butterman (Danny's dad).<br /><br />Enjoy!  By The Power of Grayskull! (yeah, they use the line from He-Man in the movie).
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Im gonna make this simple, if your a fan of the game this movie may spark up some interest for you. However, anyone else who wants to watch a good horror movie, trust me this isn't it. Its way to long, boring, and serously lacking a good plot. I'm sorry if this makes anyone mad, its just a personal opinion...
B00005JPCF|5.0|In a world of formulatic animated movies this one really stands out, but it pays the price for its originality, leaving many viewers apparently aching for something more familiar.        But for those with a taste for something... less familiar, it would be hard to beat this extraordinary piece of art written in a strange, musical language meant to suggest the language of penguins, one presumes, rather than the language of homo sapiens.  It is a form that takes some getting used to.   But when one does get used to it, it starts to grow on you, at times becoming very moving and joyous.  In this way watching this movie reminded me of my high school Spanish class, when we would read great Hispanic authors writing in their native Spanish - a different artistic language that took some getting used to, but when we did, it provided a unique artistic experience that was both highly enjoyable and, obviously, highly memorable.          It seems reasonable to observe that art that's worth anything stands out.  It also seems reasonable to observe that when someone actually produces something that stands out, a lot of people don't like it.  We hear that genius is never appreciated in its own time, which seems a bit of an exaggeration, but it's probably not too far off the mark to suggest that when genius does pop up, a lot of people prefer Sponge Bob.          As for me, I don't see why one can't like a little genius AND a little Sponge Bob.  Perhaps just not on the same day.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|As a 30-yr Rush fan, I buy everything that these guys put out.  Even their worst efforts (Vapor Trails? Hold Your Fire?) are better than 99% of the junk that passes for rock n roll/metal these days. After hearing \\"A FAR CRY\\" on the radio, I wasn't too excited about this album, although with the dearth of quality stuff out there today, I was more than willing to buy it rather than download it.  I'm glad I did.  One of the things that I mark as a great album is if it gets better by the listen, and this does.  I read somewhere that one of the pink floyd guys, gilmour, I think, gave Alex some advice to \\"go acoustic.\\"  It was a great suggestion.<br /><br />I would put the musicianship of Rush up against anyone.  With 30 years of consistently putting out quality, they really take 2nd to no one.
B000929AJQ|4.0|With Teeth souinds like a soundtrack for a broken heart (exception being The Hand that Feeds).  Tracks like Only, All the Love and Everyday is exactly the same are deep and dark songs about broken relationships, disillusionment and loneliness.  At first listen I really didn't think the songs were great.  But after a couple of more, I enjoyed them much more.  Not as great as Year Zero or Downward Spiral, but it's better than most people give it credit for.  Recommended.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This presentation of Global warming is brillant, riveting and so well done that I had my grandchildren watch with me. They watched intently at my side and have since embraced changes in their young lives to correct our destructive journey on planet Earth. Al Gore has been on the mission of saving earth as an inhabitable planet for our children and grandchildren for years and I am happy that the rest of the world is finally listening. I found this DVD easy to understand and impactful.  If you don't start recycling or using the Carbon Flouescent lightbulbs after this DVD you must be from a different universe and should go back there! I will be buying this DVD for Christmas presents.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Antichrist Superstar is an excellent disc.  Divided into three parts, the songs tell the story about child who grows up into a disturbed person that you'll want to fear.  A product of his enviroment you might say.  In some ways it's an autobiographical tale that's a hommage to the philisophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche.  Grant it, if he made an album soley based upon his works, it might be a tad boring.  But, when you add some shock value to it, people will want to buy it,  After listening to the album, Manson is a very well read person.  If you can get past him trying to be the uber shockmaster, you'll realize that he's a very talented and bright person,  Antichrist Superstar is followed up by the slightly superior disc The Mechanical Animals.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />The videos for this album were obviously influenced by Alejandro Jordoroswki.  Marilyn Manson also has great taste in movies as well.
0064407667|3.0|I can't say that this is a horrible book, but I can say that I was disappointed and mildly shocked that this is a book intended for children. When Mr. Poe tells the Baudelaire  children that their parents have died in a fire and that they, as orphans must go to live with a distant relative, Count Olaf, it goes from bad to worse. While I will agree that this book is expertly written with a unique voice and style, I think the content is far too mature and dismal to be offering it to children of the younger persuasion.<br /><br />With drunken relatives and their equally gruesome cohorts, child abuse, neglect, and relatives trying to marry children to gain their fortune, I have to ask if this really qualifies for good entertainment? Brad Helquist has incredible talent as an artist, and the prose is catchy, but...<br /><br />Would I recommend this for a child? Absolutely not! An adult? Maybe, but I think for now, I will simply say I read it, and leave it at that.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero is part one of a two disc concept album about the future of America.  Recorded with the help of Garageband Pro, Trent Reznor provides us a glimpse into an all but possible reality in the coming years.  The marketing he used to promote the album was very fascinating indeed.  Faux websites, video clips and other forms of multimedia .  The album is a step up from With Teeth,  We get an angry and motivated Trent Reznor.  The previous was a self pity and bitter album, which is good but this one is awesome.  The way this country is headed and if we don't do something about it, Year Zero will become a reality.  If you enjoy concept albums or are a big fan of NIN, go out and get this disc!  It's not that expensive and it comes with a slick lyric booklet and a color changing disc.
0439680093|4.0|Matt isn't really a bad kid, he's just looking for someplace to belong and maybe a reason. He is however different from your average kids, and someone out there seems to know that. When he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, Matt's entire life is ripped apart and he is sent on a journey that is more than a little strange, and altogether terrifying.<br /><br />Worse yet, when he finds himself packed off to Lesser Malling, things get even weirder. Knowing he needs to escape the nightmare he is living, Matt is faced with mortality and his true self. But everyone who tries to help Matt ends up dead or missing. Is the place he's supposed to call home filled with witches or is there a greater evil at hand?<br /><br />Anthony Horowitz writes a remarkably dark tale. As an adult, I wondered if it might be too graphic for the kids, but I could not put it down. I can see where readers of the dark and gritty would high five Mr. Horowitz's talent for the creepy. A very good read and I am looking forward to Evil Star.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is concept album split in two parts.  Part one is about an alien named Omega who comes to Earth and his caught up in it's decadent lifestyle.  Part two is about a glam rock band called the Mechanical Animals.  The album orignially came with some cool multimedia stuff, but the re-releases have none of these.  Inside the CD is a slick booklet with lyrics and the correct track listing for the two concept pieces.  The album is even more mature and structured than Antichrist Superstar.  The lyrics are deeper and in my opinion a better album. I wish people would get pass the Manson's shockmaster title and try to listen to his music.  He's a very talented writer when he's motivated.  Coma White is the final track the somberly ends the album.<br /><br />Highly recommened.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|this is another awesome cd from brad paisley...i highly recomend it, you'll just keep listening to it over and over.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|People won't dare rate this movie low because they don't want other people to think they're shallow or culturally lacking for not liking it. All because it's a \\"foreign\\" movie. That's the advantage of making a movie with this kind of tone to it: at worst, the reception by the public will be maybe just slightly above average, and at best, be received exactly how this movie was: as a great movie. The truth is this was a long boring waste of time.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you could miss 5 minutes of it here and there, and it would have absolutely no bearing on anything. I thought in movies, every piece of dialogue, every frame of every scene *counted, and was shot a certain way for a reason? This is like the opposite of [[ASIN:B000B5KSFQ Back to the Future]]. This was unnecessarily long because they spent so much of the time showing characters doing trivial things that didn't advance the overall plot.<br /><br />When they cut between the 4 separate story lines going on, taken by themselves they are pretty good scenes that are well acted and leads to those characters' individual story arcs. But you don't just cut together 4 separate stories like that without some central plot to tie it in and expect to get a good movie. And no, the damn rifle doesn't count. Don't even try to act like that minimal amount of relevance some of the characters had to each other amounts to anything, because it doesn't.<br /><br />At about the halfway point of the movie I was sitting there wondering what the hell was the point of all this, and didn't really understand where they were going with this. As the minutes ticked by beyond the halfway mark, I slowly came to the sad realization that I had in fact wasted my time on yet another over-hyped movie (up until then I assumed it would get better, silly of me).<br /><br />You don't make a movie like this. That's not how you do it. A book maybe, but not a movie. There was 0 drama, 0 tension, and the number one important thing, 0 empathy for ANY of the characters, and without that, why even watch it?ters, and without that, why even watch it?
1400063515|1.0|Taleb tried to differentiate between JK Rowlings, author of the Harry Potter Series and a &#34;baker&#34;. Taleb states that when JK sells a book, millions read it. She doesn't have to do anything else. When a baker bakes a cake he has to do it each time for each customer. Never mind the author may never make a buck after spending hundreds of hours on a book, and waiting years to get discovered by a publisher while the baker can 1) purchase a house sooner 2) pay his larger bills, 3) and send his kids to Ivy League schoold if he has too!  Furthermore dunken doughuts and cheescake factory also make millions ($). In Talebs' calculations he is not allocating all resources used in production, marketing and sales. The book though produced by one author is backed by huge publishing empire behind which is spending millions on advertising. Further the book chains also get a piece of the pie. Just like an invention or patent might be backed by millions in resources to bring it to market. Sometimes they (authors and publishes and patent owners and their backers) win and sometimes they (god forbid ) lose.  The recipe for cocacola resulting in coke the drink will continue to sell in many magnitudes more then all of JK books combined.  So I don't know what Taleb is trying to explain. Is this book about the highly improbable or a poor description of what success is or what makes a successful company and or how to mass produce and sell a product? The author is confused. Why is he talking about JK Rowlings in the first instance - and again how does this relate to what this book is about in the first place?  Taleb then amazingly compares 9/11 and Google as being incredibly outragious events. I guess he must know nothing about all the attacks or events of destruction in the last 15 years around the world as if everyone expects those to occur on a daily basis. He also seems to know nothing about the many other successful companies around the globe. Of course since he probably uses Google (or is impressed by its ability to)  store  documents and email on its servers, and at the same time give itself (Google) the opportunity to peak inside so that they can advertise to him, he is impressed with them !! (shhh. there is nothing extraordinary here !).  Again, what is the point of including Google as an example? Someone commented that Taleb included it as it has affected the world more than other companies have in the past 15 years. Sorry, this is not the case. If you want to talk about effect over the past 15 years please look at -  1) Internet Explorer, Microsoft - Used by millions 2) Very thin notebooks (2 Lbs and less, made by various vendors - Used by Millions.

Further there may even be other or better examples than those I have listed ! So why has Taleb included Google as an example in this book?  In another chapter, he compares a prostitute to a speculator and several others. Why include a prostitute as an example in a book of the improbable. Interesting. Don't waste your money on this book instead buy those extra groceries so you don't have to come by the store so many times. At least the book is written at the same intelligence level as his prior book Fooled by Randomness and thus you can be more than sure he wrote it and not a ghost writer.
B000J10EQU|1.0|Actually I take that back, this went nowhere fast..very fast.<br /><br />I've got to say, this was one of the most BORING uneventful movies I've ever seen. There's no excuse for me to be able to say that about a movie like this.<br /><br />Why didn't they go more in depth with the characters? It's not as if the screen time was used up by action scenes, since that was nonexistent. They could've had some interesting subplots with Lois' husband, as well as the son. The ingredients were all there. There could've been some interesting conflict between the husband and Superman, but they didn't explore that one bit.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Yeah that works. I haven't done all the research, so I'll gladly be corrected if I'm wrong, but I believe that it is impossible for a human being to possess less charisma than she did in this movie. What a dreary, dead-eyed, lifeless dry rag she was. An open can of ravioli by Chef Boyardee has more charisma than she did, empty or not. Also, her and Superman had less chemistry than I did in my sophomore year when I dropped it.<br /><br />What a pathetic excuse for a movie, but as usual, the idiotic mindless fans eat this stuff up.
0688014291|5.0|This is a great little introduction to personnel management.  Though slightly misnamed, the book introduces three skills of management which can be done in a concise way (but probably not quite 60 seconds).  Managers should cast clear vision and expectations, commend good work, and correct mistakes.  That's it.<br /><br />The reason the book is so good is that so many managers can't or won't do those three simple things.  The ability to confront employees in a non-combative way is too abrasive for sensitive people-people, and too limited for true autocrats.  Praise is simple and obvious enough, but many managers think they've done it when they haven't.  And precise goal-setting is sometimes beyond business leaders who do not have sharp mental editing skills.  When you're finished with the book, you haven't heard anything you didn't already know, you've only been reminded of how important it is to do these things.  Like diet and exercise, most of us know what's best for us regardless of whether or not we do it.  Additionally, and this is a subtle point, the manager has to express how he or she feels about an employee's performance, and accurate expression of feeling is sometimes beyond the emotional range of some really driven leaders.<br /><br />It's a top notch, brief read.  Everyone in leadership ought to read it, even if they walk away with nothing new.  The only thing I'd correct is some mediocre narrative, as the whole book is written as a fictional set of interviews by a young manager-to-be of his idiolized One Minute Manager, running a company.  But no one's reading this book because they meant to pick up a good novel, so writing style is a minor issue.  That aside, it's worth the content.
0061122416|5.0|Santiago the shepard searching for the meaning of life, or searching what he is destined to become, or foe he really is. The ultimate universal need for validation and exploration of one self. I am one of these guys. Aren't we all? May be this is why this book is close to a bible to me, with all due respect.    I remember reading this beautiful book in one sitting. The first time I ever learned what 'Maktub' is, the arabic word for destiny, but believed in more than just destiny. It is what you are going to be or find eventually. That doesn't mean we are not capable of choosing who we are. We are all that we wish and think all day, it is just that it is a great journy in life to value and admire what you already have. Santiago took the journy we all eventualy take. Out of our own self with no satisfaction or understang of who we are or want to be, roaming the universe for answers and findings, then finally back to our own new valued and respected self after seeing what the world is all about. I like this theme very much. In fight club ( a far fetched comparison i know ) it was how do you know anything about yourself without fighting someone else. In the human effect, how can we build for shelter from the ctastrphies if there is a possiblity that is us who are the catstrophe, In the talented mr ripley it is the question of how many identities we have been chasing to get lost and never find ours )     Of course Paulo Coelho does it in its best non-threatining tale of magic, not making it hard for us to understand and never embedding universal matters of the soul by telling a wicked or provicative story. He did it inginiously by telling what could be a bedtime story.     A classic that you have to read. Other Paulo Coelho are very different, this one is the best you get and it will not be written alike again.    Maurice

B000063UR1|5.0|This is one of the best Science Fiction movies of its time. The plot line is pretty good although a bit unlikely but the message is right on point. Bruce Dern portrays a tragic sort of character caught between an uncaring humanity and a fragile and endangered nature. He chooses the latter. The movie benefits greatly from the music of Joan Baez which is just perfect. If you are a tree hugger, then this movie is for you.<br /><br />You need to keep in mind that this movie was made in the 1970s so its special effects are dated although they were very good for the time.
B00005JPLW|4.0|While the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the ancient wonders of military history, and King Leonidas (who led the Greeks against the Persians) is one of the great military heroes of all time, the producers of the film 300 decided that wasn't good enough, and that they could improve upon the story. I don't agree with that. Frankly, I think their departure from history takes away from the story's impact. Making it a fantasy adventure, and the soldiers super heroes, takes away from the real people and the real event.<br /><br />According to the facts, Leonidas led a contingent of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians against a Persian army numbering in the 100's of thousands, if not several millions. But, as if the facts weren't enough, Frank Miller (author of the graphic novel upon which the film is based) and director Zack Snyder decided to tell the story, not as a Greek heroic epic, which it most certainly is; but as a dark, Nordic tale in the tradition of Beowulf. Why they did this would be a good question for an interview or a psychiatrist's couch. The extra features really don't reveal this.<br /><br />So, intermingling the incredible facts as we know them from Herodotus and others, we have other darker elements:  like a decadent and diseased priesthood, mutant man-creatures, super-size rhinos and elephants, dark nights with Wagnerian moons, decapitations and other bloody aberrations that even the most gothic of writers would envy. There is nothing of the happy, sun-drenched countryside of Mediterranean Greece here.<br /><br />The Spartans had a severe warrior culture that demanded discipline and abstinence from the corrupting arts and vices of other Greeks. They were also very practical people who steered away from the complicated religious and mystical thinking of cultures to the east. They were a very honest, outdoor people that were taught to tell the truth from an early age. So, to include corruption and intrigue on the scale presented here misrepresents the straightforward simplicity that was Sparta.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as misplaced as some of these elements are historically, and as strange and disturbing as the film is at times conceptually, it is interesting both visually and cinematically. We have never seen anything like this before. Most of it was created via blue screen and computer, much like Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow. But it goes far beyond Sky Captain, because Miller has created a powerful vision in his novel that holds Snyder's film together and gives it a look. To say that it is graphic is an understatement. It is quite handsome. It is also quite sensual, and is a study in flesh as well as blood, both of which are shown quite prominently.<br /><br />Storywise, 300 is over the top:  a cross between sci-fi thriller and military epic. It is narrated for us by David Wenham (Dilios), Leonidas' second-in-command, the man Leonidas sends back to report their heroic deeds to the Council, and the man who eventually leads the Greek army back against the Persians after the 300 have fallen. It would have been nice if the filmmakers had opened with Dilios speaking before the Council, so that we knew who the narrator was in the beginning.<br /><br />Leonidas, who is introduced to us as he teaches his son to fight, is played super-heroically by Gerard Butler (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie). I cannot imagine another actor in this role. Butler has pumped himself up to football linebacker size and bodybuilder cut. But more than his look, he conducts himself as a hands-on military leader who knows how to inspire his men to \\"do their duty,\\" so that we believe he truly is Leonidas. There have never been more ferocious looks on screen, with his white teeth and whites-of-his-eyes gleaming from beneath his helmet. As the perfect action hero who can also act, he has taken his career to the level of stardom with this one.<br /><br />Also memorable are Lena Headey as Leonidas' gorgeous wife Gorgo (appropriate name) andRodrigo Santoro as the affected king-who-would-be-god Xerxes. Which brings up another point:  art direction. It, too, is over-the-top. Persian art is very well documented. There are even statues of King Xerxes, so we know very well how he looked in an official capacity. But all that seems to have been ignored in this film. Again, it is a departure from historical fact; but the departure is quite interesting.<br /><br />There are very many elements in 300 that are unsuitable for children of any age, most women and men who are squeamish. Like Apocalypto the previous year, this is a ground-breaking film, but it is not for everyone. I love the slow-motion fight sequences; but there is a glorification of violence in the idea of violence as art which many viewers, including myself, do not accept. And there are several sexually explicit scenes that don't add anything to the story.<br /><br />The bottom line is, this film will never be more than a cult classic because it doesn't allow us into the story. I think that is the weakness of a film shot almost entirely on blue screen. As a theatrical piece and as cinematic art, it is memorable. But as drama, it won't hold up over time. The extra features on the two-disc special edition support this view. The filmmakers were willing to sacrifice everything for the fantasy look of Frank Miller's graphic novel. You can't do that and end up with a great film. You need a certain level of reality for most adults to relate to a film. And when you have history that is already great drama, why sacrifice it, especially for a fantasy look? It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Waitsel SmithXerxes.

Can't wait for S2 dvd to be released.  Hopefully it have even more features and I'm sure it will be even better.

0375847227|5.0|Phillip Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" triology is the kind of story that you simply must read if you are a science fiction fan, or if you just like well-written books... You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy it, but you need to have a big imagination in order to thoroughly do so. If that is the case, go on reading this review...<br /><br />The \\"Dark Materials\\" triology takes place in a world similar to our own, that is at the same time very different. In that world, each person's soul can be seen, is called a \\"daemon\\" and takes the form of an animal. The daemons of children change their appearance constantly, but once the children become adults, their daemons choose only one form. Pullman's alternate world has other differences, too, for example the fact that it has different kinds of magic, and that witches and armored bears coexist with human beings. The result is that the world he builds is exotic, strange but at the same time familiar.<br /><br />On the negative side, the writer also plays with an institution we are familiar with, the Church, using its name but leaving behind its essence, in order to talk about a world ruled by tyrannical ecclesiastical authorities. I didn't like that, and probably you won't like it either, but keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, and as such, its purpose is to entertain, not to be taken seriously. All the same, if you think your sensibilities will be offended, or that you won't be able to separate reality from fiction, don't buy this book. You will be losing a lot, though.<br /><br />Regarding the plot of the books included in this omnibus edition, the main character is an orphan girl named Lyra, that lives in the Jordan College of Oxford. Her life involves no more responsabilities than playing in the grounds (and roofs!) of the College, and making mischief with her friend Roger and her daemon, Pantalaimon. But all changes when Lyra hides in a closet and hears her uncle, Lord Asriel, talk about some weird things that are happening in the North Pole to some scholars. Lyra wants to go there with him, but is not allowed to do so. However, soon afterwards her dear friend Roger and many other children disappear, and when all clues point out to the North Pole, Lyra will start a journey to rescue them. That journey will take her to many places, allow her to meet lots of different people, and help her to discover new things about herself and others. If you want to share all that with Lyra and Pantalaimon, just read this book :)<br /><br />After reading \\"The Golden compass\\" (first book of three included in this edition), I thought that the triology was promising. However, it was only when I finished the last book in the \\"Dark Materials\\" triology that I realized why it has such a reputation as a masterpiece of science fiction. On the whole, I think that this box set is a treat teenagers and adults will enjoy, but I believe it may be too complicated and somber at times for young children. Provided you take that opinion and my previous comments into account, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: A film based on the first book of this triology is to be released in late 2007. It is directed by Chris Weitz, and stars Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I loved this movie because of the amazing use of music, and the companion soundtrack did not let me down. Songs like \\"Meaningless Kiss\\", \\"Don't Write Me Off\\", or \\"Dance With Me Tonight\\" were great to listen to in full. The other songs were just fun and lively. If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|As many have stated, this is not a fast-paced, sexy, James Bond type movie with car chases, explosions and buxom starlets. This is a complex, intricate film that will reward those who follow along, although the almost three hour length will be a bit much for most. In describing the ideal candidate for an intelligence officer, one character states that attention to detail and the ability to sort truth from misdirection is paramount. The same attributes could describe the ideal viewer, let alone the ability to deduce the outcome. In ways it's reminiscent of The Conversation, with failure, guilt. trust and choice as major themes that are sometimes played out in ironic twists of fate.     Matt Damon's performance might seem wooden, but it's the few moments when humanity does creep through his stoic front that are the tell-tale heart of this movie...what at first appears to be a shield becomes reality over time. It's a difficult character to play but he handles it well (aging makeup aside - or was DeNiro saying that \\"nothing ever changes\\"?).     Many comments here rake Angelina Jolie over the coals, but I don't know why. Her nuanced performance was excellent, from the flirtatious child of privilege toying with her beau (her insipid question at the beach tryst shows he desperation for an emotion she has never been surrounded by and doesn't understand) to the confused and later frustrated wife who realizes she ultimately is surrounded by deception.    The cast is filled with superlative actors, although some don't get beyond a few small cameos. Billy Crudup, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin and William Hurt are very good in support, as is Oleg Shtefanko as Damon's KGB counterpart. However, Michael Gambon is exceptional - an Oscar nomination would not have been out of line.    The pace is methodical, and DeNiro's decision to jump timelines might exhaust the patience of those seeking to follow the plot. But if you watch closely and listen carefully, you'll find the truth...although much like for the movie's characters, it's not always what you expected it to be.
1594489505|5.0|This is a book for all readers, not to be missed.  From the tragic beginning of Miriam's childhood to her last experiences in the book you are taken on an amazing journey of pain, submission and still the strentgh to go on.    Also introduced into thte story is Laila and Tariq- two young villagers who have interest in eachother, but find fate pulls them apart from what could be.    These lives intertwine and wind together in tragic and yet beautiful ways... the life purpose they find in the midst of war, loss of family, and loss of love is breathtaking. At times the conditions of their lives are so heartbreaking you will find it hard to believe women endure such a society and lifestyle, and the refernces to 9/11 are absolutely striking, as well as customs which continually suppress the women in the book.     The spirit of the book, the purpose and importance of each persons life, the need for survival for all people, is so beautiful  and rises to shine in the midst of a tragic story.  Will have you yearning for more and feeling like you have really looked into the desperate times of Afghanastan and the women who live there.

I had no prior knowledge about the actress or the movie, so her transformation mid-movie into this striking, poised, turned-on woman -- wearing shackles as she conducts her secretarial business with a smile on her face -- was a completely unexpected pleasure.  James Spader is right at home as the weird guy who turns out to be the perfect complement to this disturbed woman and the one person in her life who can bring out the best in her.  Their interplay reveals some truths about human nature that maybe only the adventurous and honest among us would admit they recognize.  S&M, per-se, certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea.  Still, there's something insightful about the success of their particular relationship.  I'd double-bill this with \\"The African Queen\\", or maybe a Tracy / Hepburn movie.

B000P407K4|5.0|&#34;In the days after it first opened in early 1964, Stanley Kubrick's &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; took on the enchanted aura of a film that had gotten away with something. Johnson was in the White House, the Republicans were grooming Goldwater, both sides took the Cold War with grim solemnity, and the world was learning to be comfortable with the term &#34;nuclear deterrent.&#34; Roger Ebert<br /><br />I purchased the 40th Anniversary CD and this is my third or forth viewing, but &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; seems fresh and undated - an irreverant satire. The willingness of the Director to follow the film to its conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has that special touch Its black and white photography is in particular important for its portrayal.<br /><br />General Ripper orders the B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. When the British military attache, Peter Sellers, tries to stop him, Ripper explains the plot to &#34;taint our water supply and deplete our &#34;precious bodily fluids.&#34; He won't even discuss the re-call code. Eventually, he realizes he will be caught and he ends his game. Events on the Army Base are mixed with the War Room in the Pentagon. President Muffley learns from Dr Strangelove and the Doomsday Machine. It appears that neither the Doomsday Machine nor one of the U.S. bombers can be turned from their missions.<br /><br />&#34;The movie's screenplay, by Terry Southern turn this scenario into a dark comedy of errors, illuminated by flashes of brilliant satire. Some of the dialogue has entered the language - &#34;precious bodily fluids,&#34; of course, and also the way the dim-witted Col. Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) hints darkly of Commie &#34;preverts.&#34; The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British attache, who does not have the correct small change to call the White House and save the world, is one of the movie's best-constructed gags.&#34; Roger Ebert<br /><br />The acting in this film is superb, in fact it would be very difficult to top this crew. Sterling Hayden is the epitome of a paranoiac Gen. Ripper. George C. Scott, however, steals the movie and is brilliant as, Gen. Buck Turgidson, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Peter Sellers, as President, as Dr Strangelove and RAF Group Captain Mandrake h portrays the epitome of humor, satire and acting. Maj. &#34;King&#34; Kong (Slim Pickens), is perfect in the role of the pilot.

1400064287|5.0|Are you looking for a why-to-buy message for your newest product?  Are you wondering why the message you created for an earlier product isn't working?  If so, you'll want to read Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath.  You might recognize the Heath brothers from their Fast Company columns.  Every time I read one of their columns I learn something new and valuable.  I figured their book must be just as good and I'm happy to report they didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The authors have boiled down the stickiness factor into 6 principles: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotional and stories.  If you nail all 6 of these you're highly likely to wind up with a very sticky idea, message or promise.  They make a compelling argument, so much so that I'd like to put summaries of these 6 elements on the side of my monitor as a gentle reminder.  (That's something they ought to add to the book's website: a downloadable PDF that can serve as either a summary bookmark or monitor note.)<br /><br />The one key ingredient in this book that I loved the most was the wealth of hands-on, real world examples presented throughout.  These not only helped the authors make their points but also made the book an enjoyable and memorable read...hmmm...sounds like they followed their own advice on the \\"concreteness\\" principle.  The authors also take the time to show how their model maps to many of the stickiest ideas of all time.  Clinton's \\"It's the economy, stupid\\" and the marketing power of Jared from the Subway commercials are two of the more well known examples.<br /><br />One of the more interesting stumbling blocks presented is what the authors call \\"The Curse of Knowledge.\\"  As they put it, \\"once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.\\"  This issue not only gets in the way of presenting good ideas (because you're not putting yourself in your listener's shoes) but it's a classic problem associated with writing a good how-to book; all too often authors will write step-by-step information from the perspective of a knowledgeable expert, not a novice.<br /><br />This is another one of those rare books where a summary just won't do it justice.

6302420326|4.0|Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there.<br /><br />KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?<br /><br />As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.<br /><br />Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.<br /><br />But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.<br /><br />Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.ikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|This film offers a great new experience in film dealing with sexual matters.  It offer a look a real sex in real time and lifelike situations.  I am impressed with the openness of the film and the guts of the actors involved with the story.  Congratulations!  Maybe we will be able to look at sex in a more realistic way which seems more healthy for all concerned.
B000EZ913I|3.0|I really am enjoying hearing these high quality releases of music in DVD-A and SACD.  But this is an odd offering in MONO.  I knew this producer well and know that his stereo mix is by far the intended mix.  By this time mono was a quick combining for AM radio.  Columbia must have damaged the stereo masters to bring this album to us in mono instead of stereo.  It is definetly not as enjoyable a listen in this format.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This is a must have if you want to purchase the Friends series. Why pay $20 and up per a season when you can get the whole series for under $165 with shipping?
B00006L6YG|4.0|It's hard to beat the gritty-rich presence in the quality of these early pop & jazz 4 track recordings.  This is a wonderfully high quality quality recording available in the wonderful format of SACD.  Even though it is stereo mix only, I love play this SACD version of this album.
0812550706|5.0|This book is great! I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down. I have always been a fan or Orson Scott Card and this just makes me want to get my hands on more of the series. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good Sci-Fi read.
0142000671|5.0|There is not a wasted word in Of Mice and Men.  An unforgettable and brillaint work by John Steinbeck.  It is clear why this is a classic.  Every emotion on the spectrum is represented somewhere in this concise and gripping story of the enduring and heartfelt friendship/guardianship between Lennie and George. I loved it, and to think this was first published in 1937, it feels like much more modern writing.  Reflecting on  novelists since, it is clear that Steinbeck was ahead of his time and an early pioneer of captivating American writing.  Splendid and tragic.
0312323867|5.0|I really loved Something Borrowed, but Something Blue was my favorite of the two and I hope not the last of the series!!!  I read this book in one night, I could not put it down.  I'm not saying it changed my life and it's deep, it's chick lit so just keep it light and enjoy it as delicious fiction :)     I really liked Baby Proof too.
B00097DXZS|4.0|Santana moves out into a new more hip  hop style genre in this fantastic CD.<br />Favorite song is with Michelle Branch \\"I'm feeling you\\"!<br />This song is in my estimation a masterpiece.
B00005JPKE|5.0|I loved Flags of Our Fathers, and particularly the human element of how the battle and the flag raising effected the three survivors, but Letters from Iwo Jima may be even better.  Like most Americans I have been bombarded (rightfully so) with the many Japanese atrocities, and you certainly see some in this flick as well, but you really get to see the humanity of many of the Japanese who fought and died on Iwo.  Ther perspective was very interesting, and I would highly recommend anyone interested in this battle and WWII, in general, to watch it.
0743201140|5.0|The book is really easy to follow and at the same time it asks a lot of important questions... find it out yourself:)
B00003CXMG|4.0|Have you ever seen a movie that everyone was raving about and wondered after it was over what in the world they were talking about? Well, rest assured this isn't a movie where that will happen. It's funny, yet truly touching at the same time, a hard mix to achieve. I really think there's something in this movie for almost everyone and I recommend it wholeheartdly!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|i had just recently seen roger waters live in concert and i wanted a little bit of comparison from david gilmour. Wish you were here was amazing to hear from david gilmour, the original singer. great sound cool effects a must have in your pink floyd collection.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|Wow Beyonce's re-release of this album is just amazing! She has an amazing beat to the album, great lyrics, and just fun to listen to!!!    My favorite songs are:    Upgrade U    Get Me Bodied    Freakum Dress    Ring The Alarm    Irreplaceable      (Well Basicly The Whole Album Hahaha)      Can't Wait for her second album!!! Plus this album is at a very cheap price!!!        YOU GO BEE!!!

0143038419|5.0|This book touched me in many ways -- it's thoughtful, funny - spiritual -- Anyone who has ever been through a divorce, believes in listening to your inner voice, and in the pain/joy of what unfolds ahead needs to read this book. (And, I never write reviews) I'm on my second read of this because I can't find another book I like so much.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If only we had listened to the message in this movie, Kerry and the country could have begun the long process of rebuilding from the disaster that is GW Bush four years earlier than how it turned out. Not that Ohio wasn't stolen or anything....
B00005JPAO|5.0|I just finished watching this for the second time tonight.  I enjoyed this movie just as much as I did when I first saw it in the theater.  Helen Mirren rightfully received much critical acclaim and a deserved Oscar.  However, the rest of the cast, including Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and James Cromwell as the irascible Prince Philip deserve strong recognition for their performances.<br /><br />The film does a superb of showcasing the struggle of what many consider an outdated institution with modern England during a time of crisis.  The restraint and \\"dignity\\" that served the monarchy so well, especially Elizabeth, after WWII clash with realities of the death of a commoner who endeared herself to the people of England and of the world.<br /><br />Stephen Frears does an exceptional job interspersing television footage from Diana's death in a way that enhances the story, but does not become overly reliant or melodramatic.
B000KZ3BWE|4.0|Everyone should see this flick. For being so educational, it is also entertaining; hopefully school teachers will show this movie at the appropriate time....
0374105235|5.0|This book is a powerful, depressing and ultimately uplifting story about a mostly overlooked issue that plagues much of Africa.  Beah's memoir should be required reading for all Americans about one of the many disasters taking place on the African continent.  Beah recounts being taken into service as a rebel soldier at the age of 12.  At an age where most children in developed worlds are beginning to read classic literature, study foreign languages and learn about the world around them, Beah is swept up in the pervasive post-colonial violence that is haunting and destroying much of Africa.  Having three young children, I was left haunted by the thoughts of innocent children carrying machine guns and killing people without hesitation.  They are trained to become immune to a life filled with violence and killing from sunrise to sunset.  The most compelling portions of the book are the harrowing first two thirds of Beah's life as a boy soldier.  The rehabilitation he undergoes after being \\"rescued\\" by the United Nations provides an uplifting and redemptive message but is not nearly as strong or well written as the first part of the book.  It is certainly rewarding that a few lucky children find their way out of such desperate conditions.  However, it is ultimately depressing to think about the multitudes of young and innocent children like Beah that are being destroyed daily -- this doesn't even deal with the other plague, the scourge of AIDS sweeping through sub-saharan Africa.  A generation of African youth is being swept away, decreasing the hopes for an end to the cycle of despair and destruction for the continent.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My girlfriend and I couldn't stop watching these DVDs. Almost pushing me over the edge towards purchasing an HD DVD or Bluray player to go along with our beautiful 1080p 56 inch Samsung. Nevertheless, the regular DVD quality is also amazing, and the narration is superb. Still had a craving, so we ordered 'Blue World' as well....
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|FOLLOW UP RELEASE (THIRTY YEARS LATER) OF THE MUDDY WATERS, JOHNNY WINTER, JAMES COTTON TOUR, CIRCA 1977, ALL LIVE CUTS IN THEIR RAW, HARD-EDGED, BLISSFUL FORM.  THIS IS GREAT STUFF.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY ONE OF THESE THREE ARTISTS, OR ALL THREE OF THEM ,THEN YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK OUT THIS CD.  IT IS GREAT.  THEY JUST DON'T MAKE MUSIC LIKE THIS ANYMORE......................
B000OCXMAE|4.0|You know what makes me angry.... All these people who have given poor reviews for \\"Minutes to Midnight\\". Note that most most the people giving poor reviews are immature high schoolers or younger who haven't developed their taste in music yet. All they want to hear is the same stuff. Linkin Park did a great job with this album. You can tell they put alot of thought and feelings into the music they wrote. What's good about this album is they kept the Linkin Park sound we all know and love, and mixed in a few tracks that were a little different in rythym and sound, it's nice to listen to an album all the way through and not every song sounds the same. In fact because of those reasons, it would be a plausible arguement that this is their best album out. However, everyone and their cousin is freaking out over them making a few minor changes adding several heart-felt tracks. God forbid any band try to be diverse and show they have more than one sound! If you enjoy the original Linkin Park sound you'll get that from Tracks 2, 6, and 8. Track 3, and 5 are slower in pace, but the music is catchy, and Chester does an outstanding job on the singing and lyrics. You don't even have to be a full-blown Linkin Park fan to enjoy this album, but if you are a true Linkin Park fan, and have mature taste in music, I guarantee you will like this album. It was worth every penny I spent to buy it, no regrets. Ignore the other reviews that bad mouthed this album. I read those reviews too, but I decided to ignore them and give this album a shot, because I'm a linkin park fan, and I'm very glad I did so.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|The picture quality is very poor. A few good action scenes, but don't waste you money on the Blu-ray version.
1843104954|4.0|Very good book with a lot of excellent information. I'd recommend this as the first book to be read on the subject of Asperger's Syndrome, because it provides an excellent foundation of knowledge on the subject.
1594489505|4.0|Beautifully written (like the author's previous title \\"Kite Runner\\"). Gives a glimpse of Afghanistan, a country most of us in North America know little about. Personally, however, I found the subject matter so depressing that I could not finish reading the book. Other readers may not share this reaction.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This musical is from the independent movie, Once. It is very beautiful, lyrical and haunting at the same time.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This man is a genius.  He takes simple lyrics with simple heartfelt themes and turns them into masterpieces.  He's emotional with a voice to match, and a great guitarist.
B00005RHGK|5.0|A brother and sister, heading home on college break down a highway that looks like the never ending \\"route 66\\" have a encounter with a big, black, ugly van that holds an evil presence, in the form of a part man, part bat and part devil/evil.<br />I do have to say that this isn't your usual horror, cut-em-up, splatter flick. It actually is a creepy, spooky, intelligent scare movie with fantastic acting.<br />Because the main characters are teenagers the basis for this old fashioned horror has elements of innocence, fear, and the overt feeling that these kids are really terrified and alone in their nightmarish isolation.<br />This movie really got under my skin because it delves into the true psychological nature of what truly terrifies us----\\"the unknown.\\"
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The follow up to \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", was a huge success and this latest incarnation is a true collector's dream. Alan keeps getting me to part with my hard earned money as I have owned the Japanese virgin vinyl LP, Japanese version CD and now the latest expanded version. The latest digital remastering is most evident in the silent intros of \\"I Robot\\" and a heightened presence is noticeable throughout the CD. The real bonus here is almost filling the CD's limit with pure Alan Parsons' music. I like getting my money's worth. Additionally, the \\"Naked Robot\\" has captured the essence of the entire album sans all the vocals in a single track. The same treatment was applied to the re-release of \\"Eye In The Sky\\" with two tracks, \\"The Naked Eye\\" and \\"Eye Pieces\\". If all of the original works are re-released with a \\"Naked\\" reworking (not just a remix), I can foresee a future release of \\"Alan Parsons Project Naked\\" someday. So, far these additional gems are very clever and enjoyable. The other bonus tracks give us great insight into the evolution of the writing and arrangement processes behind several songs. I applaud \\"the master's\\" works and look forward to more to come.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Well, I must say that Ryan Gosling definitely deserved his Oscar nomination for this film.  He plays an inner city history teacher who tries to help a young girl, Shareeka Epps, grow up in a crime-filled neighborhood.  I am surprised that Epps did not get an Oscar nomination as well for her poignant portrayal.  Gosling himself has some demons to fight like his drug addiction.  Still, both characters, teacher and student, help each other out through their rough times.  This small film did not get much attention without the big names like another independent film this year (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\").  Overall, this was a touching and realistic look at inner city school life.<br /><br />The outtakes on the DVD are hilarious.  Gosling goofs around on screen with Epps and other actors.  For some reason, Gosling loves to gesture at the camera.  Everyone else just try to get their lines straight which is also funny.  I still can't forget those stupid jokes/stories from Gosling and Epps (nacho cheese, cement, interrupting cow).  It still brings a smile when I recall those charming little stories/jokes that lighten up those serious/difficult moments.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|The latest incarnation of \\"Eye In The Sky\\" is worth while by the additional tracks and the reworkings of some great songs into a \\"naked\\" version of the album. The musical offerings of enjoyment total an hour and 17 minutes. Again, Alan has been generous in giving his fans more than simply a digitally remastered version of this classic album. A great deal of effort and forethought is evident. His current project of digitally remastering and re-releasing his classic albums has included a few gems of some raw and evolutionary song efforts. The newest releases have also included a \\"naked\\" version of the title track which is more than a remixing some of the album's songs into one new one. It appears to be totally reworkings of several songs on the CD which captures the flavor, the essence of the entire album. His latest \\"projects\\" are working, as I keep parting with my hard-earned money in obtaining his latest versions. \\"Eye In The Sky\\" has two extraordinary tracks which in their own way have captured the feeling of the entire album, \\"The Naked Eye\\" and \\"Eye Pieces\\". Both of these, plus the rarely glimpsed early song efforts make it worth the price of admission.
B00005JPQT|1.0|Well, he at least should be an easy guy to like, and has been for 20 years. In this however, the wonderful character of John McClain failed to make an appearance. First off, no swearing. Well, I don't care if a movie has swearing or not, but this is Die Hard, and that's the Die Hard character. He's a guy's guy, he's brutal, he breaks peoples necks, tells them he's gonna cook and eat them after they're dead, refers to people as 'f**k face' a lot and has one of the most well known movie lines of all time, which incidentally, includes the word f**k. So, why did they have to make it without swearing? Seriously, from an artistic point of view, or simply in respect of the character and the films that came before it, it should have had swearing. Bruce Willis isn't too old for the part, but the script was lousy and played off like he was. They just made him a dumb computer illiterate who everyone thought was stupid. Stuff like covering a web cam and whispering isn't funny, it's just ruining the integrity of the character. He felt more like a super hero than a real guy, never once had an expression of fear or immediacy on his face, and was always happy to go to the next location when John McClain's role in every movie is that he always wants out.     First major problem with the film was the script. There was no hook, no one thing for him to get his teeth into. The movie wasn't claustrophobic at all and there was no time constraint. The result was that it took place over a fairly long period of time for a Die Hard film, rather than one evening to night or during the day. Every film is done in one go, in one bad situation. Die Hard with a Vengeance has the line when Samuel L' Jackson says 'You're about to have a very bad day' and us Die Hard fans were thinking, 'Alright, here we go again'.    Well, not this time.    The bad guy in the film was probably the worst bad guy I've ever seen, and that goes for all movies. He was so weedy and wimpy. There is no way in a million yearsthat he would have kept McClain's daughter alive, or handed her the phone at certain points. She didn't need to be there, and he would have killed her.     God bless Kevin Smith, but he didn't belong in this film.    Why is it, that at the start of the film, the bad guys were sending viruses to kids houses who were playing Gears of War (Nice product placement there). But seriously, what's the point? John McClain knocks on the guys door before the pc explodes, the kid answers it because he doesn't know anyone wants him dead, so why can't the terrorist guys just knock on these kids doors, pop a gun between the crack of it, shoot them dead and walk out? Might attract less attention than a massive explosion!! But no, we have to settle for the PG rating virus explosions, because people can't die properly in films anymore.    Why was the film so shiny? Why were there so many unnecessary cuts? It seems like all movies today are made for people with ADD. Where's the pacing, the build up, the silence before the storm?    Why was the dialog so awful? Watch the scene in the limo in number 1 with Argyle and how great the banter between them is. Then watch the awful, awful, AWFUL dialog he has in the car in this one, when Justin Long says something along the lines of 'You watch the news!!! Oh my God, you watch the news!! What's wrong with you, do you know how much they lie to you on the news!!!!! The news! My God, you watch the news!!! And you listen to popular music!!!' ...    Jesus.    Somebody actually got paid to write that? I was sitting there thinking 'I'd rather watch the news than this lousy excuse for a Die Hard film'.    Why, of all things, was the Die Hard title screen different to how it's been in every movie so far? Die hard always slams in from the left and right of the screen, but not in this, they just said, 'no, screw that, forget the old films, no one cares'. Well, how would you like it if someone changed the opening STAR WARS title, and just blipped it on instead?    This is easily the worst of the four, and Die Hard 2, despite me loving it, isn't a great film and shouldn't have been too hard to top or at least equal. All those that say Vengeance was weak, I suggest you watch it again. The script is great, and it's the only film directed by John McTeirnan aside from the first and it shows through.    John Mclaine is a great character. The Die Hard films are fantastic action films. His lines stick forever, for example;    'Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs'  'Thanks for the advice'  'Welcome to the party pal'  'No f******g s**t lady, does it like I'm ordering a pizza!'  'If you're not part of the situation then you're part of the problem, quit being part of the f*****g problem and put the other guy back on'  'Ehh, sorry Hans, wrong guess, would you like to go for double jeopardy where the stakes could really change?'  'What's this a tag team?'  'For once I'd just like a nice quiet Christmas ... but here I am, climbing around in f*****g tin cans'   'How can the same s**t happen to the same guy twice'  'Well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a burning sensation between my toes'  'He'll feel better when he looks in the back seat'  'Laundry day'  'Anyone catch the lottery last night ... see, I got the ticket right here'  'Say hello to your brother'  'Yippee Ki ya Mother F****r'    These are only a few, but you find me anything in live free or Die Hard that even comes close to these lines or scenes. All we get is him doing his McClain laugh since the script writers are practically brain dead and waste every opportunity for a good line. People have told me that a great line in this one is 'I'm gonna go kill this guy and get my daughter back, or get my daughter and kill this guy.'    Do I really have to comment on that? It's like he can't speak English. He just said the same thing twice, and neither time was it even witty!    The problem nowadays, is that Hollywood sell their films based on the action and the effects. It was nice to see real stunts in this film, but so what? He wasn't jumping off the top of a building as it explodes behind him, and what was real in the film was so badly edited that the stunts lost their impact. Way back when, there was a nice balance. If they wanted to make an action film, there was no CG, so they had to do the stunts. If they were going to take the time to get them right, then they were going to make damn sure the script was good so the stunts were worth doing. Sadly, this no longer seems to be the case, and Live Free or Die Hard was just another action film full of plot holes and no substance.    Oh, and that Bowman guy sucked.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|One of my alltime favorites. The dancing is breathtaking. A must have for a DVD collection.
B000P0I4O4|4.0|I felt the plot was incredible. Come on people..an inside hitman kills the kid of the original hit just to draw him out. Then the hitman crashes his car and finds himself under arrest but now because he is an \\"inside man\\", a hit is put out on him! This movie had so many twists going on that I found myself on the edge of my seat. I loved it and I am going to recommend it to my friends.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|this was wonderful! colors were great! & of course the musical is great. teenage girls watched it several times.
1594489505|5.0|I am not a fan of fiction but was unable to put this book down.  The author has succeeded in drawing the reader into the world of each character to the point where you have to remember that it is a fictional piece.  The historical facts scattered throughout are such a great addition to the creativity of the fictional part of the writing. There is no lull in the story line whatsoever and having read the Kite Runner would say that \\"Splendid Suns\\" far surpasses it.  You will not be disappointed with this choice.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I know there have been some bad reviews about this movie already, but I just want to say that they are wrong!! The cast in this movie is amazing! Any movie with two powerful actors like Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is always amazing! This movie keeps your head turning at every minute and is definitely worth watching. I enjoyed the suspense and the suprising twists in the movie.
B000059T1E|5.0|As a fan of every Traffic lineup and release \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is their finest moment. Every song is beautifully arranged and performed. Winwood's voice is spectacular and every song is memorable. This is a top ten desert island disc. A masterpiece from beginning to end. The two short bonus tracks are a nice extra for those of us purchasing this album for the third time(vinyl, CD, CD remaster)
0446607274|2.0|pros:  usual Harry Bosch character    cons:  opening crime not very interesting.  tension between Harry's crew and IAD not very engaging.  plot moves ahead sluggishly.    I had to give up reading this at p. 170 of 454.    As usual, minimal character development. Emphasis is merely on plot. I saw little of Harry's personal life,  except for his occasional attempts to call his wife. (But this is true of ALL Michael Connelly books. And I usually put up with it.)
B000QUCNP4|4.0|I read the book ZODIAC back when it was relatively new, and I was simultaneously sickened and entranced by it. The real horror is the true stuff, of course--and this true forerunner to smash hits like CSI was a terrific read before it was a good movie.<br /><br />People who enjoyed movies like SE7EN (from the same director) will be satisfyingly shocked and appalled by the first hour; viewers will hang around for the second hour (and a half) only if they like their mysteries and thrillers from the policing end. Both halves of the movie work remarkably well, but as a film, it does seem to have two totally separate identities, or story arcs, and that makes the movie seem longer than it is.<br /><br />People who have read the book will particularly enjoy seeing how the writing process came about, and how the story of the Zodiac just would not die, even after the book's publication. Very good stuff on every level, this movie is highly recommended.<br /><br />(Thie review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
1416911049|1.0|Clumsily written, condescending to its target audience.  This isn't a book;  it's a product.    No doubt The Uglies raises issues that are important for adolescents to talk about, but they don't need to read a badly written book to talk about these issues.  Why did I, an adult, read it (or try to)?  Because my son and his friends were complaining bitterly about being assigned this work.  Fortunately these kids like to read, but being assigned this book struck a blow against that precious enjoyment.    With hundreds of well-written books in print--some of which raise similar issues--why would schools assign this artless and punishingly long production?
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|Here's a premise, startlingly akin to Orson Scott Card's EMPIRE novel, rich with dramatic and suspenseful possibility: take a professional sniper (the best ever, of course), make him disillusioned with a government he can't trust (they killed his best friend--naturally), then rehire him and betray him all over again. Mark Wahlberg, of Marky Mark infamy, is just such a sniper, and he's hired to help prevent a presidential assasination. How's he going to do this? By anticipating the assasination strategy in advance so that the plan may be thwarted. Problem: the people hiring him really just want a good plan to assasinate the president themselves.<br /><br />And the best American assasin in the world can't see this? I ask you.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can get past the improbability of this plot, there's a passable action flick here. My only real regret, expectations being what they are, is all of the slow-motion photography, which I suppose is made to make Wahlberg look exceptionally cool, when all it really does is, well, slow him down.<br /><br />Good, not great. Goes for most of this kind of thing.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")

B000JLTRKE|5.0|There are a lot of people who criticize Oliver Stone for his leftist, conspiracy-themed movies, finding them at once preachy and ridiculous. There are others who went to THIS movie wanting all of the 911 conspiracies explored and validated. The first crowd of criticizers will be pleasantly surprised by WORLD TRADE CENTER, while the second group may consider this piece surprisingly unambitious and simple. You know why? Because it was taken from the story of two cops, unencumbered by political motivations, who only wanted two things: first, to help people trapped in the doomed buildings, and second, failing that, to stay alive themselves.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is a simple movie, and that's a welcome antidote to those of us who have become rather stupified and torpid by Stone's self-indulgent attack ads against the government disguised as movies. He's always a great director, but his films are often swept away by the mission-mindedness of his scripts. This movie is free from all that.<br /><br />Cage is great. Gyllenhall is great. The shots are poignant, not exploitative, and the film crackles with suspense because it is centered on its story--not the implications of the story, which the viewer can draw for him or herself. That's the way PLATOON was made; that's the way, before Stone got all important, he wrote scripts for films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN and SCARFACE. Make no mistake: that kind of selfless discipline serves a story like this--with the country so torn in half over IRAQ--perfectly. It's one of Stone's better movies, and when you examine the earlier half of his career, that IS saying something.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
B0000X61UU|5.0|I am a huge fan of Cindy Crawford's workouts which are not only effective but also beautifully filmed with awesome music. The Next Challenge is by far the most challenging of her 3 workouts and gets me into shape faster than anything I own. There's a mixture of everything here - cardio/legwork, upper body toning, lots of abs and stretching. Cindy is there working alongside you and is very motivating. Her body is slim and toned yet curvy and is attainable instead of being intimidating.    Everytime I lose motivation to work out, it only takes this one to get me going again - awesome workout which will get you incredible results in next to no time. I workout first thing in the morning before work and the last thing I need is loud, jarring music - the music is wonderful, motivating without being annoying.    Get this workout now!
B00005JPQR|4.0|In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", the third installment of the Jason Bourne saga, all the familar and welcome elements of the earlier movies are present.  The action is non-stop.  Several sequences are shot in a grainy, off-angle, often under-lighted manner that adds to the suspense.  The locations (Moscow, London, Turin, and New York) are exotic battlegrounds for close combat, gunfights, and violent car chases.<br /><br />Matt Damon is simply superb in his by-now glove fit as conflicted and amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, relentlessly on the move and endlessly innovative.  Julia Stiles returns as CIA logistician Nicki Parsons, and Joan Allen does another turn as Pam Landy, a hard-nosed agency staffer with a surprising amount of sympathy for the killing machine her organization loosed on the world.<br /><br />The action picks up right where the Bourne Supremacy left off, with a injured Bourne evading police in Moscow.  He breaks into a clinic to treat his wound; the pain and stress trigger a flashback of his indoctrination as an agent.  The story fast-forwards to a British journalist in Italy and London seeking information about a covert operation code-named BLACKFRIAR.  The journalist draws the attention of both the CIA and Jason Bourne; the CIA to seal a potential leak and Bourne to seek clues to his identity.  Bourne will reach the journalist first but lose him to BLACKFRIAR itself, a no-holds barred counter-terrorism operation run well outside existing intelligence law by a posturing and cynical Deputy Director played by David Straitharn.<br /><br />With few new elements to introduce, Director Paul Greengrass wisely keeps the action moving at a breathless pace, much faster than the viewer can note or worry over plot holes.  Bourne relentlessly follows an unbroken string of clues through a small army of CIA operatives and a couple of Bourne-like skilled killers back to his point of origin.  Along the way, he will form surprising alliances with several CIA personnel uncomfortable with the extra-judicial killing of BLACKFRIARS.  We glimpse Bourne's long-suppressed humanity in his interaction with a sympathetic Nicki Parsons and with one of his own clones.  The ending nicely wraps the storyline of the current movie, but leaves the door open for sequels.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as exciting entertainment, loosely based on the Robert Ludlum book of the same name.extra-judicial killing of BLACKFRIARS.

B000002G8J|5.0|BACKLESS is yet another great, if low-key, solo CD by Eric Clapton. Granted, there are no standout songs here on the level of SLOWHAND's \\"The Core\\", which was a big exercise song for me, but instead, you get a CD that's consistent overall. I can't say this CD is as essential as, say, 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, JUST ONE NIGHT, SLOWHAND, or LAYLA, but it's essential nonetheless in its own laid-back way.

B000001EGE|5.0|HONKY CHATEAU is the first true rock & roll CD by Elton John. Songs such as the cheery \\"Honky Cat\\" and the braided-rope-angst rocker \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\", as well as the album's best songs- \\"Slave\\", \\"Amy\\", and \\"Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters.\\" The latter song's jaundiced view of New York City began to strike a chord with me after my trip to the relative quiet of Maine, and I fully empathize with what Bernie Taupin wrote in its lyrics. Along with GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, ROCK OF THE WESTIES, CARIBOU, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, and MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER, HONKY CHATEAU is one of the essential Elton John CDs to own.
0143038419|2.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's quest to deal with life post-divorce could have been interesting, enlightening and entertaining.  Instead, the reader is treated to whining, moaning and more whining.  I rapidly lost sympathy for her and could only wonder how her marriage lasted as long as it did.  Ms. Gilbert is a gifted writer and parts of the book were witty and humorous, but too often she succumbed to the temptation to wallow in self-pity.  Too bad...this could have been a great book.

0061256447|2.0|The Judas Strain seems to be trying too hard to be the Davinici Code.  Yet this novel lacks the suspense, or accurate historical researcher, to justify a lackluster plot that takes place on several continents at once.  I found myself unable to stay entertained by the meandering plot, whose characters failed to grip me.  The religious overtones, and Vatican involvement, are forced and unnecessary.  Peter Jay Fernandez does an acceptable but over the top job narrating the audiobook.  I kept expecting him to say, \\"come to appliance world, where low prices are our priority!\\"  His tone and over-enthusiasm seem better suited to cheesy radio or TV ads, and his voice really got on my nerves as the book progressed.  I'm not sure how such a dull \\"thriller\\" ever made it onto the best seller list.
0895292211|1.0|As 'a reader' has pointed out, this book is comprised of wholly fallacious claims based on insane leaps of (il)logic. It is completely unscientific. Period.     Get on the internet and do your own legwork to discover how food enzymes have not been proven to do anything for our digestion, and how the concept of a 'metabolic pool' of enzyme precursors is simply wrong.     The burden of proof is on the theory proposed. As it is, there is none.

B00005JPMZ|4.0|Over a decade since their last outing, everyone's favorite sewer-dwelling, pizza-eating mutant reptiles are back and in top shape - this time as sleek, computer generated personas. TMNT's skateboarding reptiles named after art masters, talking master rat, and Michaelangelo's incessant bad jokes will drive home the nostalgia for any fan of the crime-fighting foursome. The nonstop action, wildly inventive character designs, and impressive computer animation will undoubtedly entertain everyone else.<br /><br />Taking place after the events of the original films, the brotherhood of ninja turtles is thrown into disarray when Leonardo departs for South America to hone his leadership skills at the behest of their sensei, Splinter. Michaelangelo and Donatello attempt to acquire slightly more \\"normal\\" jobs during Leo's absence, while Raphael, pining for the days of fighting crime, turns to the vigilante justice of his armored alter ego, the Nightwatcher. Upon Leo's return he is met with animosity by Raphael, and Splinter orders the group not to resume their crime fighting duties until they can once again work as a team. But when the mysterious industrialist, Max Winters (voiced by the instantly discernable Patrick Stewart) hires Karai and her Foot Clan to aid in the acquisition of 12 extremely dangerous ancient beasts, Leonardo is captured by the stone generals of a 3,000 year old army attempting to open a portal to another dimension in order to unleash a demon force capable of destroying the earth (did you honestly expect a more conventional plot from a story concerning talking mutant turtles trained in the ways of a ninja?). Now the remaining turtles, along with the help of their friends Casey Jones and April O'Neil, must band together to defeat the dark forces that threaten civilization.<br /><br />It's quite an undertaking to revitalize the cult phenomenon of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, especially after a 14-year film hiatus, but the artists at Imagi Studios have done the adventurous reptiles justice. Highly detailed textures adorn the four heroes' streamlined models and the added attention to their shells and weaponry elevates the overall result. Outlandish antagonist designs stand out against the rather expected look of the human characters, especially several of the twelve ancient monsters and the four stone generals, whose appearances range from inspired to near-genius. Add to that the ridiculously detailed backgrounds and locations that inhabit the turtles' New York cityscape and you've got an animated visual feast rarely equaled. Perhaps the only disappointing character design was that of the curious Max Winters, who looked suspiciously like a rejected cast member from The Incredibles.<br /><br />An impressively diverse voice cast lends their talent in creating the turtles' world with Mitchell Whitfield, James Arnold Taylor, Mikey Kelley, and Nolan North as the teenage heroes while Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans portray April and Casey. Patrick Stewart is antagonist Max Winters, while everyone from Laurence Fishburne to Zhang Ziyi to Kevin Smith supplies their voices to secondary roles. The late Mako provides Master Splinter with a slightly raspier tone than any of his previous incarnations, which may be harder to accept for die-hard fans, but still adequately fits the wise sensei figure.<br /><br />While it may appear as if the action never lets up (and it seldom does) an underlying theme of honor, respect, and camaraderie does exist. But enough about that. The action is where TMNT shines and it's properly attended to as the majority of fans would expect from the ninja turtle universe. Top-notch animation brings the ninjas to life in a way live-action never could, with exaggeratedly agile martial arts moves and over-the-top combat. Fantastic fight sequences abound with colossal battles interspersing intense duels, and the radical camera movements and extreme angles highlight every slice of a sword and swing of asai. A driving rock soundtrack hurries the action along and tight pacing helps keep the truly bizarre bits of the story from drifting too far astray. Incredible particle effects also enhance each fight sequence, most notably in an extraordinary rooftop duel in the rain where one can't help but think \\"Cowabunga, dude.\\"<br /><br />Though only a handful of gags will likely induce full-out laughing in adults, the immature quips that dot the screenplay keep the proceedings consistently lighthearted and guarantee fun for audiences of any age. With more than its fair share of spectacular action and adventure, combined with gorgeous visuals and the deft attention to the fundamentals of mutant ninja turtle doctrine, TMNT superbly carries on the legacy of the heroic crime-fighting brotherhood with style and wit to spare.<br /><br />- Joel Massieack hurries the action along and tight pacing helps keep the truly bizarre bits of the story from drifting too far astray.

B00005JPLW|2.0|A retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae but adapted from Frank Miller's Graphic Novel offers over stylized battle scenes at the expense of story. 300's major flaws are how it makes this heroic story of 300 Spartans a flat and dreary affair outside of it's CGI - in fact you'll think you've seen it before because it rips off every sword and sandal epic up through Gladiator. In fact 300 freely borrows its soundtrack, dramatic presence and iconic imagery from that film. Gladiator is recent enough in moviegoers minds that the blatant ripoffs are truly lazy and cheesy. The other flaw is a cringe worthy script that in light of current headlines are so simplistic and aggrandizing as to make one wonder if comic books are all the filmakers read(apart from Gladiator that is).
1400082773|3.0|I chose to read this book because I am very interested in Obama as a presidential candidate, and logically wanted to get to know him a little better.  His memoir gives a really good picture of his life and has helped me understand where he is coming from in his politics.  That said, this book was a little slow to start and a bit hard to get through, partially because he is a bit verbose throughout.  The good news is that the excerpt of \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" in the back was not in the same vein as this book.  So, I'll still read the second book without hesitation.

032147404X|3.0|There's no doubt that Kelby knows Photoshop inside and out, and that he's got a lot of good general photo tips. But he spends so much time making jokes in this book that it quickly becomes annoying.<br /><br />At one point, he literally spends an entire page with a convoluted explanation, only to say afterwards, 'I was joking.' Thanks for wasting my time, Scott.<br /><br />This is not a bad book, but there are other, better ones -- and ones that are less about the writer's ego and more about taking good photos.

0743298020|5.0|Do you enjoy Barbara Wood, Dorothea Benton Frank, Anne Rivers Siddens, Barbara Michaels? Then you'll enjoy adding Diane Setterfield to your library collection of books you love to read over and over again.     The Thirteenth Tale is a story within a story. Ghosts? Maybe. But not what one thinks when ghosts come to mind. No rattling chains, no moaning in the night. It is a story that should be read on a quiet evening, in a huge comfy chair, a soft light resting gently on the pages and nothing that needs your immediate attention for hours.     It will begin slowly but with each turn of the page you will be drawn into the well written story from this wonderful new author. She has a true talent with words and a way of expressing things that makes you feel like you have escaped your world and joined the world she has created. Now that I have finished it, I crave more. But the sad thing with finding a new author is, you have to wait for her next book to be written. I hope I won't have to wait long.

We talk about what the fish's perspective must be like, and using \\"mind movies\\" to visualize what he must be imagining as the frog describes his adventure.  After I read the first recollection of the frog, I have the children imagine what the fish is imagining.  I give them time to see what the fish is seeing, then I reveal what he actually saw.

1400044162|5.0|[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]<br /><br />Two African Igbo sisters and their families get caught up in the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s which culminated in the attempt to form the Republic of Biafra.  Don't worry if you shy away from dry historical tomes.  This novel centers itself in the absorbing domestic tensions between the complex, three-dimensional characters:  Ugwu, a perceptive young houseboy who works for the somewhat pompous revolutionary professor Odenigbo; Olanna, a beautiful woman who loves Odenigbo; Kainene, her plain but resourceful twin sister; and Richard, the white Englishman who's in love with Kainene.  The viewpoints are Ugwu, Olanna, and Richard.<br /><br />I liked almost everything about this story, but my favorite thing of all had to be the dialog.  It seemed to perfectly convey the musical quality of both spoken Igbo and African-accented English.  By that I mean that, though I've never heard Igbo and have rarely heard African-accented English, it got recreated in my mind as I listened to her characters chatting, bickering, joking, and saying very heartfelt things.  This novel won the Orange Prize for fiction by women.  Longer review on Impatientreader-dot-com.
0240808452|5.0|I have been illustrating professionally for 15 years. I am self taught, meaning I rely on books and the advice of my peers.       I've always noticed there was some elusive thing that was usually missing from my figure drawings that made them less dynamic. Burne Hogarth's books were very helpful, as in [[ASIN:0823015777 Dynamic Figure Drawing (Practical Art Books)]]. But they didn't teach me how to get into the flow. How to make them go POW!!       Remember those John Buscema roughs in [[ASIN:0671530771 How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way]]? I used to think that his talent was the ONLY thing that made his work so forceful. This book gives you the direction to feel out these forces and shapes. I used to think that these things couldn't be taught.       When Mr. Mattesi's lessons click in your brain, you are truly feeling this power.       For me it makes all the difference in the world.  Brian LeBlanc
B0001932ZA|4.0|If there's another film out there featuring two future governors, I don't know what it could be.  Ironically, both future politicians' characters actually reflect their future terms in office to some degree: Arnold is the independent tough guy determined to do what he thinks is right, while Jesse Ventura is a washed-up buffoon who can't be taken seriously.  Then, of course, there's Richard Dawson, who funnels all those years of game show hosting into the role of Damon Killian, host of futuristic America's most popular game show, The Running Man.<br /><br />There's really nothing complicated about The Running Man.  Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) wrote the original short novel over the course of three days and published it pretty much as it was, with little editing to speak of.  This is entertainment, not a deep psychological study of tyranny or a cinematic lament of 21st century American society.  While the film does deviate from King's original novel (especially in terms of the ending), it does capture the adrenaline and animalistic frenzy that defines King's original vision.  In the futuristic plot, America has become one big police state, a totalitarian society that controls the thoughts and actions of all citizens - and keeps them happy through such wildly popular state-run broadcasts as The Running Man.  Like the gladiator fights and slaughters of Christians inside the Roman Coliseum of old, this reality show stirs up the blood lust of all members of society, displacing the woes of their everyday life with the thrill of a deadly hunt for hardened criminals.  It's The Most Dangerous Game on a societal level - strip the victim of all humanity in your own eyes, give him a head start, hunt him down like an animal, and kill him.<br /><br />Everyone wants to see Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) die.  Government lies have labeled him the Butcher of Bakersville, the monster responsible for a vicious aerial attack on unarmed protestors at a food riot.  In reality, it was the fact that he refused to kill innocent women and children that turned this ex-cop into America's most-wanted criminal in the first place.  All the notoriety associated with him makes Richards the perfect contestant for ratings-obsessed Killian - until, that is, Richards starts demonstrating the remarkably annoying habit of staying alive.  (It really isn't all that difficult to outwit such over-the-top \\"stalkers\\" as an opera-singing dude wearing Christmas tree lights all over his body and a killer who can only do his stalking on an ice hockey surface.)<br /><br />The Special Edition release comes with two DVDs, featuring newly remastered widescreen and full-screen versions of the film.  Frankly, given the lackluster look of the film, I see no evidence of remastering.  Then there are two audio commentaries included (which I haven't bothered to listen to) - no Arnold, just director, producer, and executive producer.  And then there are the other special features, none of which are at all special.  The \\"Meet the Stalkers\\" feature is trivial and boring, the \\"Game Theory\\" documentary commenting on the state of reality television is tangential and bland, and the documentary on privacy in post-9/11 America is a bad addition any which way you look at it.  A ridiculous piece of liberal propaganda, \\"Lockdown on Main Street\\" features twenty-five minutes of hysterical liberals bemoaning the fact that our government is actually doing all it can to stop future terrorists before they can kill and maim ordinary citizens such as themselves.  Whether you agree with this tripe or not, it's pretty sad that an entertainment DVD should be politicized with such a one-sided diatribe (although it's hardly a surprise, given Hollywood's unabashedly leftist agenda).fact that he refused to kill innocent women and children that turned this ex-cop into America's most-wanted criminal in the first place.

B000J10ERO|4.0|After finally seeing this movie, I think Brandon Routh was unjustly raked across the coals.  I thought he did a good job as Kent/Superman-mainly because he was seriously channeling Reeve's performance.  As far as Lois, Bosworth was a little on the young side and she didn't bring anything unique to her character, but her performance didn't turn me off either.  The film did bite off a little too much from the first Superman and when it did it one too many times I was irritated.  The Plot...well, all right I didn't understand the master plot.  But Lex Luther and his henchmen obviously were the inspiration to such cartoons like Pinky and the Brain.  What are we going to do tomorrow?  Take over the world.  Speaking of not bringing anything new to the table what happened to Spacey?  He used to bring such chrisma and presence to the screen.  Now it seems like he plays all his characters the same.<br />The main problem with bringing Superman to the table now is...well, we already get our Superman fix in Smallville-which is a pretty darn good show, by the way.  So when I saw the trailer for the movie I didn't want to see it.  I like following my weekly soap from the WB.<br />So what do we have?  A few miscasting and a M.I.A. plot.  And still I was entertained.  Go figure.
156224003X|5.0|Even though, as a previous reviewer has noted, many of these truths should be self-evident, we forget them often. If nothing else as a reminder of what we already know, this book is a gem.    I would recommend this book for any musician.
0061122416|1.0|I was so disappointed when I finally read this book.  After hearing of it for so long I bought it and was utterly bored with it.  I kept waiting for it to go somewhere but it never did.  I should have known when in the intro page the author or publishers resort to celebrity namedropping in order to entice the reader. This is an old story told long ago with the same themes in children's fairy tails. I gave it to my 10 year old son who liked it but did not love it.  This book is for people who are into spirituality and the self absorbed who expect a book to change their life.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Sean Connery's character is based on Ralph Ellison; the famous African American novelist that produced only a single Masterpiece (Invisible Man).  The book \\"Ralph Ellison's Collected Works\\" has an essay that was first published in the Atlantic Monthly back in 1970; it's called In-Divisible Man.  The essay begins with a scene that is eerily similar to a scene from Finding Forrester. I recommend anyone that loves this movie get a copy Ralph's Collected Essays and check it out.  Like Ellison's Masterpiece--Invisible Man--the themes explored in Finding Forrester are, above all else, universal; you could replace any character with another character of any race or gender and it would still work.  It would have worked if the entire cast was white or black or green.  This was a very well written and expertly realized film.  Also:  These connections with Ralph Ellison are a wonderful topic for a high school literature class to tackle.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|An angry CD, telling a story of breakup, love lost, confusion and self doubt in finding love, hard rock, more than pop. Different than Breakaway, more angry than blues, harder. But lots of energy, good variety in the songs. I love the last song Irvine, softer song. I look forward to Kelly's creative growth. I do recommend the CD; I am listening to it almost every day at work. But it is not the rollerblading, workout CD that Breakaway was.
B000N6U0E2|2.0|I'm told that soprano sax hack Kenny G once played a sustained, uninterrupted note for an entire hour.  (There is no data available regarding how many audience members took their own lives in response.)  In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith tops this dubious distinction by playing the same note for 2 hours straight, no variation in pitch, tempo, color, texture - unadulterated schmaltz.  Smith is box office gold because he's just so darn wholesome and non-threatening, which is precisely why he had no prayer of pulling this off.  Had it been played for real, this would have been a dark and chilling movie, ultimately an inspiring one, but it's far too well-scrubbed for that.<br /><br />Smith plays Chris Gardner, and Gardner's overriding passion is to be a good father.  He and real life son Jaden Smith traipse through the film like a couple of hobos; one expects to see them holding cigar butts with toothpicks and playing harmonicas.  Mom, played by the exotically beautiful Thandie Newton, abandons Chris, son, and the pleasures of San Francisco to work as a waitress in New York.  (Presumably there were no more waitress positions available in San Fran.)  Why she breaks that strongest of all bonds - mother and child - is never explained, she's a straw character exiting early.  This leaves us with only dad and son, and dad's big dream - which is to be a stockbroker.  The mystery of why anyone in his right mind would want to be a stockbroker is explained early on when Chris sees one parking a Ferrari - say no more!  Obviously a car like that is happiness - I mean happyness.<br /><br />Of course, you and I know better.  We know that the end of Chris's rainbow is not a pot of money; much less the maniacal streetwalking stockbrokers engage in to make that kind of money.  It is, of course, the relationship he has with his son - which he has had all along.  Unfortunately the director doesn't seem to know this, because all action drives from impoverishment to ultimate acceptance in the temple of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.  Any chance the film had of touching a nerve depended entirely on a convincing performance by young Smith.  He is every bit as likeable as dear old dad, a real chip off the old blockhead, but there's no spark there at all.<br /><br />As the film reminds us, Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, i.e. one must seek it.  My advice, look a little harder.of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.

B00005A8H5|3.0|SACD sounds good on front speakers - I cannot find a review that states rear speakers are not used - good sound, extra tracks, but not enough to warrant SACD status - I wish reviewers would review music quality - everyone should already be familiar with songs
B00000DR5X|5.0|I am going to recede into the background on this review. I have to. Roy brought so many well-known and expert musicians to this wonderous event and they all had the good sense to stay out of the spotlight. Well, after all, it is the remarkable Roy Orbison. And I'm sure that he taught them all a thing or two about music through the years. It is about human courtesy and respect. And believe me, Roy deserved it all.<br />This music is like silk gliding across a glistening ocean. So impeccably done and every note here is essential. No excess-no shortage. Everything in proper balance under the sun and moon. God Bless Roy for sharing his genius while he was with us.<br />I suppose what strikes me so much about Roy's tunes is his honesty. He was master at writing about heartache and loss - especially in love. But with this comes the fact that men, do indeed, cry. In loneliness- in desperation - and in love, men do cry. And, mind you, all this expressed in a vocal range that was nothing less than staggering. His was a land inhabited by wishes, dreams, hopes, fear and sorrow. And no one sang this with more dedication or emotion than Roy did.<br />This live outing treats us to an array of his best tunes; \\"Only the Lonely\\",\\"Crying\\",\\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Blue Bayou\\" and much, much more. The beauty of live sound is never more evident than it is here. Crisp, moving, and Roy's vocals wrapping you in a warm embrace throughout.<br />If you really want to experience one of the very best (and essential) artists that America ever produced - listen to Roy Orbison. A true original and irreplaceable.<br />Very high marks for this gem. To miss it is like missing a part of the soul of life. Yes. It's that good.<br /><br />Thanks Roy for coloring our lives with your songs..........Metamorpho

B00005JPQT|2.0|Two weeks back in the middle of the day I saw \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" - the latest installment to the \\"Die Hard\\" franchise. Twentieth Century Fox decided that it was time to once again produce a big dumb action movie resembling the big dumb action movies of the 1980s and 90s. Those however were a lot more fun. Bruce Willis is once again called on to play the trigger-happy, foul-mouthed cop John McClane and is given a super-nerd side-kick played by super dork Justin Long.    The plot of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is easy enough to follow just as long as you happen to be a hacker or a student attending M.I.T. yet it should appeal to the general audience who latches onto the concept of a bald cop who shoots bad guys, yells, and bleeds. John McClane and computer freak in company are trying to save America from a total computer blackout and from broken traffic lights. The villains, if you can even call them villains, are a band of M.I.T. dropouts who, instead of working on the new Pixar Animated Movie, get slaughtered by McClane who wouldn't know input from output. But Mickey C did manage to take out a helicopter with a car so I'll give him half credit.    Over all \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a ridiculous action movie based on fast talking internet slang and henchmen exploding and falls exceedingly short of its predecessors. Much like the exploding henchmen, the movie pretends to have some sort of intelligence but it really doesn't add up. If they ditched the whole the whole Evil Team of Dungeons and Dragons nerds and given McClane a chimpanzee for a sidekick you would have had a far more entertaining plot and would have gotten a better performance out of the chimp. I'm talking Oscar caliber. But instead we get the dorky nerd Long along with Willis pitted up against a bunch of geeks on their way to the Otakon Convention.    I wouldn't even consider \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" a \\"Die Hard\\" movie. Sure it has the words \\"Die Hard\\" in the title but not the meaning behind those words. Yes, the other three \\"Die Hard\\" movies are far from being existential masterpieces but they were still good flicks that supply good violent, and vulgar fun. \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a cleaner more politically correct version of America's favorite foul-mouthed action hero. It's sort of like when your mother would tell you to play \\"house\\" rather than \\"cops 'n robbers.\\" That's exactly what \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is. McClane certainly can not \\"Live Free\\" in his own picture and is imprisoned in the wastelands of a dumb PG-13 movie.    If you're looking for a watered down action movie, this is your movie. If you're looking for a movie that deals with the importance of traffic lights in the American Society, you'll love it. If you love explosions and want to get your fix of car on helicopter action, you'll be satisfied. If you're a computer hacker looking for a movie filled with words like \\"long-wave-GPS-ethernet-land card-Pentium 12-gigapixelbite-megahert-configuation routing-micro-chip-phone-X-Box 360-PS3-fiber-optic-lap-top-processing computer, you'll crap your pants and enjoy every moment of this movie. Lord knows I didn't. In the case of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", it definitely DIES HARD.

0553588486|5.0|This book was recently recommended to me by a friend, and I am very grateful that it was. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a vast, sweeping epic, weighing in at more than 800 pages, the first in a series by George R. R. Martin. Despite its size, however, the story flies by, bourne on the wings of well-wrought characters, incisive description, and intuitive insight. The world of \\"Thrones\\" is a feudal society in which magic is far away from man, where dragons are long-since dead, where dark horrors scratch imminently at the borderlands, and the nations are beginning to settle into a time of unification after a period of internicene strife. However, feuds among the noble houses continue to fester, and distrust and intrigue is rife - and may soon boil over again into war. The tale is told through the eyes of a number of characters, who each lend their own insights, prejudices, and personalities to the situations they find themselves in. This is the heart of \\"Thrones\\" - while the world is a fascinating one, those who dwell in it are the true stars, giving the entire book an air of plausibility and providing the reader with numerous touchstones to relate to. Martin is adept at writing all manner of characters, and giving each their unique voice; none seem superfluous or disposable, and it is difficult to pick a favorite. Indeed, the ending of this volume left me breathless and anxious to begin the subsequent novels. Those familiar with Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" may find much to enjoy in this work, from its feudal trappings and constant plots to characters reluctantly thrust into times they would rather not have seen. Highly-recommended to any lover of fantasy.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I love history especially ancient history and this was one of the best ways to illustrate an era of history which is so distant that most don't care for it. So despite this being based on a graphic novel(they are hit & miss, mostly miss)it was well done & even though you know what happens in the end, it still captures your attention while getting there<br />This brought one thought to mind: An Ancient Greek Braveheart!
0743496728|5.0|This is such a powerful novel, and I believe it should be required reading in middle school and/or high school.  Most certainly, I recommend that educators, parents and school administrators should read this novel.    And to read this novel is hardly a chore ~ the writing itself is excellent!  The characters are each so well-developed that you are drawn into the lives of these characters as if they are close friends, and you empathize or sympathize with each one.  The different perspectives are as enlightening as they are riveting.  I was left with the realization that each level of education and socialization we go through, from preschool through college, is the same, just ratcheted up a notch.  And finally, is adult life, whether it is the workplace ~ the corporate world ~ or politics, the legal community, high society or celebrity, or international relations ~ all that much different from high school? \\"All we learn about living, we truly do learn in kindergarten\\" ~ so the adage goes ~ and another trite saying that is oh, so true ~ we really must learn to be tolerant, kind to one another, and teach our children that ~ our very existence depends on it.    ~:

BUT, I have to say that I got into the story, and didn't put the book down until long after the rest of my family had fallen asleep!
B000PY52EU|4.0|The plot is like something out of one of those Southern-decadence melodramas by William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams:<br /><br />A morally righteous, blues-playing cuckold finds a scantily clad nymphomaniac beaten to a bloody pulp and left for dead on the side of the road.  He carries the initially unconscious woman to his shack where he proceeds to nurse her back to physical and spiritual health.  Oh, and, by the way, did I mention that she's chained to a radiator a good deal of the time?<br /><br />Based on the overheated premise and imagery alone, \\"Black Snake Moan\\" could easily have been either a sadomasochistic horror film or a kinky sex fantasy  (or a twisted combination of both).  Instead, writer/director Craig Brewer clearly sees this material as a return to the great Southern Gothic tradition of the literary past, replete with hints of potential madness, elaborate sexual perversion, and an undercurrent of racial tension to go along with all the heat and humidity.<br /><br />It is difficult to pigeonhole \\"Black Snake Moan,\\" for it is neither a parody of an exploitation film nor an exploitation film itself.  Very little of it is actually played for laughs, and that, I think, is what makes the movie successful in the long run.  It attacks the material with such a knowing earnestness that we are swept up into the drama despite being supremely conscious at all times of just how preposterous the whole thing is.<br /><br />As a thoughtful artist, Brewer uses his disturbing imagery to plumb the turbid depths of his audience`s subconscious.  The sight of a young woman helplessly chained to a radiator, for instance, inevitably conjures up images of slavery, rape, sexual and racial dominance, etc. in the viewer`s mind (the irony, of course, is that, in this case, it is the black man who has the white person in chains).  Yet, once we strip away all the aberrant imagery from the story, what we're ultimately left with is a simple tale of two bruised and potentially self-destructive individuals reaching out to one another in ways that the society around them and even they themselves don't truly understand.  The relationship between the farmer, Lazarus, and the nympho, Rae, is a richly detailed and complex one, for despite his distasteful approach, Lazarus is, in reality, a compassionate man reaching out to a stranger in need to show her that there is a better, more spiritually fulfilling way for people to live.  Through their superb performances, Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci (who has lost much of her baby-fat and moon-face and become very sexy indeed) turn what could have been two \\"decadent Southern\\" caricatures into fully-rounded human beings.  There are also very fine performances by Justin Timberlake, John Cothran Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson in support of the two leads.<br /><br />Brewer has paced his film just right, giving the two characters time to develop their relationship amidst the more sensationalistic plot elements floating around them.  He also makes the sweltering Deep South setting an integral part of the drama.<br /><br />Don't let the more unsavory aspects of the imagery and the plotting scare you off this movie.  \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is really an inspiring and moving story about how spiritual redemption and emotional healing come through simple acts of human kindness.eaching out to one another in ways that the society around them and even they themselves don't truly understand.

B000001EAQ|4.0|Even though some might say that U2 was trying to cash in on the \\"Electronica\\" phase that was sweeping our country in the mid to late 90's, I say that U2 took the electronica sound, and added their own style to it, and out came a totally unique record. It is the best and most unique sounding album they did, since their excellent sophomore album with 1981's \\"October\\" This is really a great album, and even though there are some songs here that are clearly filler, Seven of the twelve tracks really shine. U2 combined some great Electronic sounds, but they just didnt use beats and synths. The also used \\"Real\\" instruments in combination with the \\"synthos\\" which make for a pleasent treat of \\"Bowie\\" ilke material. This is not to say that they were innovators or created anyting that hasnt been done before, but what they did, as U2 always does, was try not to sound stale from album to album. Sometimes it works (Zooropa) sometimes it fails (the horrid Actung Baby) but this is a solid work, and the last solid album that U2 has done to date. And for sixty cents (used) its a steal!
B000PKG4SC|5.0|Shirley Bassey can only garner praise for this new cd. She sounds absolutely fantastic particularly on \\"get the party started\\". A must have for old fans and an eyeopener for new ones.
B000001FA4|4.0|U2 really starts to define its sound a bit more with 1984's \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" Even though there are still hints of the New Wave grooves from the first three albums, \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" seems to be more rock based, which is very strange considering the time period, then again U2 always seemed to be a step ahead of everyone else. The album starts off very strong with \\"A sort of homecoming\\" and really has some outstanding tracks up until \\"4th of July\\" Then the album falls off, with some really slow, and I mean slow paced tunes,(the only one I like toward the end is \\"Indian Summer Sky\\") that usually only wound up taking up a song or two from the previous albums. This kind of kills the album, in my opinion, as I am a huge fan of the faster paced material, because sometimes Bono gets on my nerves with the almost whiny type slow paced songs. Then again, thats just my opinion, but I am sure there are those that will love every song on this album. Its still a great album, and the last great album (once again in my opinion) that U2 would give us before they start playing around with more commericalized music. This is still a great one to have in your collection, and its needed for every fan of classic Rock!
B000GIXEIG|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie. I'm a major fan of this genre, and was hoping I'd found another clasic. After all, the movie was based on a epic. How could they go wrong? The way they went wrong was to add modern speech to the film's dialogue. Everytime I became immersed in the realistic look of the movie, a contemporary phrase or profanity would snap me out of the film. It happened time and time again. It became comical. After about an hour, I ejected the Beowulf and Grendel DVD from the player, put it back in the case, and returned it to the rental store. I haven't any desire to see the rest.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is was great as seen on TV but I didnt realize till I watched it that the narrator wasn't Sigourney Weaver like it was on air, but a british narrator, David Attenborough.  Not bad really, but not what I was expecting, his accent is thick and the dialog for him was different. The scenes were the same but he would describe them differently and coldly.  Where he was very scientific and stand-off-ish, Sigourney was straight forward and sounded like she was speaking relaxingly to you, not a preaching scientist.  She cared more about the stories and when referring to an individual animal, she would say he or she where the british narrator would say \\"it\\".  Other than the cold narrator, the scenes were just as breath-taking and amazing!!
B000063DFN|5.0|This album from Iron Maiden was the culmination of years of intelligent songwriting and brilliant guitar work. After years of line up changes, the group finally had assembled musicians with a similar vision and incredible talent on their previous album \\"Piece of Mind\\". Bassist Steve Harris sets the tone with historical based themes, and the band excels on developing these with contributions of great lyrics and intricate modal harmony. Their are no weak songs on the album, and each song holds it own very well. Steve Harris develops the classic poem \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" into a song that is daunting in its lyrical complexity and musical arrangement, to close out the album. If this isn't enough, you get an album cover featuring one of the best pieces of art to ever grace a Heavy Metal album.
0743454537|4.0|There are many things that are excellent about this book, including an eloquent writing style that manages to shift points of view with skill and ease. All of the characters are fairly well rounded, even though  there are quite a few of them. And, of course, there is the extremely thought-provoking plot line.<br /><br />However, I felt the book suffered from two weaknesses.<br /><br />One, the book was far too long and ended up going over the same ground too often. At some point, I wanted to start skimming, shouting \\"Okay, we get it!\\" I think it could have been cut by at least a quarter without sacrificing anything.<br /><br />Two, the ending seemed completely 'tacked on.'  As many others have pointed out, the ending is the most serious flaw in the book. POSSIBLE SPOILER:  By choosing this out-of-the-blue plot twist, the author has taken the easy way out. No one has to make the big decision -- it's made for them. The whole point of the book was to show how this type of decision is so incredibly hard but has to be made. But when the moment of truth comes, Picoult can't make the decision as more than the characters in her book. She has to come up with an implausible \\"deus ex machina\\" type plot device that spoiled the entire impact of the book for me.<br /><br />That's not to say the book isn't worth reading -- it IS! But I think I'll always remember it as \\"that great book with the lousy ending\\", rather than \\"that great book.\\"
0307346609|5.0|I guess if you're loking for a standard ghoul story this might not be that interesting. I'm not a horror fan, nor do I typically like reading about Zombies, but I've been sick and picked this up off my husband's reading pile out of desperation. I was amazed. Brooks captures the tone and stories of so many different kinds of people that he has to be one of the most versatile living writers. His companion book was a bit too WWII combat/artillary studies, but this book captured the feelings of victims so clearly. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to think like their characters (except that it's so well done it might be intimidating). My husband, who IS a horror fan also loved it.  Don't read it like a novel, but read it. It's worth it.
0894803123|5.0|My favorite flavor of ice cream is Coconut Almond Chocolate Chunk from Ben & Jerry's; it's only available in their stores, and isn't expected to be available in grocery stores anytime soon.  When I was on their web site, I discovered that they had published a cookbook that contained the recipes of most of the Ben & Jerry's flavors, so I immediately purchased it so I could make my favorite flavor at home.<br /><br />This book is casual and fun.  There are colorful drawings throughout, and the recipes are quick and easy.  It looks almost like a children's cookbook, and is written so that anyone--child to adult--can understand and follow the recipes.<br /><br />In addition to ice cream recipes, there are also recipes for refreshing sorbets--mostly fruit, but even one for beer sorbet, brownies--which can be used as an ingredient in ice cream or eaten alone, cookies for ice cream sandwiches, sundaes, sundae sauces, and a few specialty desserts.  Every recipe I have tried so far from this book has been quick, easy, and good.<br /><br />The book also has a history of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, helpful hints and notes on ice cream ingredients, and even a butterfat chart.  This book contains a complete index, which is helpful when looking for specific items.<br /><br />One thing that is missing from this book is a recipe for an old-fashioned cooked custard ice cream base; all of the recipes are uncooked.  While the uncooked bases are good, it would have been nice to have at least one recipe for real custard.  Also there are no photographs.<br /><br />If you're interested in making ice cream fast, this is a great and inexpensive book.  Even if you don't plan to use their recipes for your ice cream base, the book has lots of good ideas for flavoring and preparing ice cream.  I would recommend this book as an addition to your cookbook library; it's a great excuse to purchase a new automatic ice cream maker and eat ice cream every day of the summer!

There are many pictures with at least a short sentence to guide you through the movement of animation with keys and breakdowns! He also covers the importance of weight, arcs and many more! In his introduction he gives you a story of his personal experience as an animator with people that have taught him the values of animation which shows that you're getting advice from a person who went through many years of learning! Plus he has worked on really smooth animations like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Thief and the Cobbler\\"
B000H5V8DG|2.0|I love Alias and I had great expectations when putting a lot of money into buying the dvd box set - I bought it new off amazon and it came to my house with the box bent and half the dvds didn't play well at all, they skipped and the picture quality was terrible in spots.  The 2 stars is from the quality that I received initially. However, I was able to return the box and get a brand new one (which is on its way!) and the people at amazon were awesome and amazing during the exchange process.  I just hope my new box set is really new and I know that it will be a great improvement on the last.

0446693804|5.0|I must admit that when I began reading this book I was not all that interested; but thankfully I didn't.  I was told that it was a wonderful book and a must-read, so I continued.  By the time I finished it, I think I had also finished off a box of tissue.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks has a knack for writing beautiful novels (I would also recommend The Notebook and Message in a Bottle).  This is definitely, in my opinion, his best yet.  By the time I reached the 3rd or 4th chapter, I was hooked.  I could not put it down.  I had not seen the movie yet, so I really did not know the story except for the plot I read on Amazon's page.<br /><br />This book is not only for teenagers, but adults will love it as well.  If you like to read romantic novels, this is one you will never forget.  I know I never will.  Also, if you do read this book, have a box of tissues by your side.  You'll know why after finishing the book.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Anyone going into this film expecting a war film should think again. Certainly, the few amazing battle scenes are brilliantly staged, but the film is more about the survivors and their \\"forced\\" celebrity, as well as a comment on cameraderie in time of war. Unlike other reviewers who were disappointed with the lack of characterization, I had no problem empathizing with the various characters and their very different life stories. Ryan Phillippe and Jesse Bradford were quite fine, and Adam Beach really steals every scene as Ira Hayes,  the most conflicted of the bunch. Having seen \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", it's interesting to see the parallels. I was genuinely moved by the film, and I'm glad I saw it. The DVD I watched had absolutely NO extras, which is a pity.
B000RJO578|2.0|I don't understand the hype. The movie is average and its special effects are very annoying. I actually went out of the movies after an hour.
0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead really is a love it or hate it book. I liked a lot about it, but I definitely have large issues with the work. As simply a novel, I thought the story was fascinating but somewhat marred by and hard to relate to due to the absolutel ridiculousness of the characters. I can understand Rand wanted to exaggerate the characters to better illustrate her points, but let's be honest, these characters aren't human and never could be. Also, the end felt like it changed from a novel to a textbook as the characters \\"analogues\\" became monologues spouting Rand's objectivisim philosophy. Regardless, the story by itself is still an interesting read.    The real reason I still liked the book, though, and gave it four stars is because I thought it was filled with some of the most thought-provoking and interesting ideas I've read. Her concept of what truly makes a man great caused me to reevaluate what I thought defined greatness and to a lesser extent, even the kind of achievements I wanted to make in life. You may love it and agree completely with it, or you may hate it and think it's garbage, but regardless, I recommend you at least give The Fountainhead a try.
0312370830|4.0|This book appealed to me because I am a Francophile and because I love historical fiction, particularly WWII fiction.  The brief description of the story also intrigued me.  Once I began reading, I could barely put the book down.  I learned more about the German occupation of France and France's role in the deportation of Jews than I previously knew, but I also became totally immersed in Julia's story and her determination to discover the truth about Sarah.  I felt the characters were very well developed because I found myself truly caring about them.  I also found the ending very satisfying, not necessarily a \\"happily ever after\\" ending or a complete tying together of loose ends, but a very appropriate ending that in my opinion offered hope for Julia.  Don't expect this novel to explore all aspects of the Vel' d'Hiv roundups, but do expect a great story! My rating is 4 1/2 stars.
B00005JP5P|2.0|What is happening to movie writers? This movie started with a promise, a mission to the Sun in order to save the Earth, but as the film progresses it becomes a light effort with a combination of poor character development (sometimes you can't tell who is who), a 'Trainspotting in space' feel (don't get me wrong, I like Trainspotting), music video look and editing and finally and worst: slasher movie.    This is not serious sci-fi, I agree with another reviewer that this is many movies in one, perhaps a concious homage from the director in the cases of Alien (dinner in space, camera angles and lighting are the same of the dinner scenes in Alien, we are going to investigate a signal from a derelict ship) and 2001 (space suit design and space walk); then we have Event Horizon (airlock rescue, slashing), Solaris (the psychological feel), Supernova (mission in a star, more slashing); all these not necesarily bad, but the movie has no style of its own, it borrows heavily from previous sci-fi themes without having a substance that belongs to it.    That plot of the psychopath slashing the crew is so BAD, it's even laughable, it did slashed the decreasing interest I had as I viewed more of the movie. But what can you expect, later I found that is the same writer of 'The Beach', an incredibly overrated movie.  And again, a mission where all the ship is badly damaged in an instant by whatever and the crew has little possibility of survival: Red Planet, Mission to Mars, Armagedon, Deep Impact, Lost in Space and so on, you have seen it ALL in so many movies, what a lack of creativity! 'To create tension and danger, we will damage the ship beyond repair', oh great, I take my hat off for you movie writers.  Finally the editing: specially in the action space scenes, is so fragmented, you have to guess what is going on.  And where is the science? Why the sun is dying? What the bomb is supossed to do? What are supossed to be that high energy, speed and light waves that make so muchdamage (an artistic license to represent the solar wind with its high energy particles?)? A man with no space suit jumps to space and everything that happens is 'oh it hurts a little, but I'm ok', Mr. Science Fiction writer: did you know that when exposed to vacuum, the blood boils almost instantly because of the lack of pressure?    The plus side is the production design, the special effects and the acting is decent, but everything else is a mess. A perfect example of style over substance.    If some movie producer reads this: want to make great science fiction films? Take a bunch of books of Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov or other awarded sci-fi writer, hire a good director and make movies with the same stories. I guarantee, high quality films with more than decent profit.    Science Fiction is about human exploration, the future of humankind, the possibilities of the human genre and its capabilities, the discovery and application of new scientific principles and the unknown, the search for answers, it is a genre that could be so complex and deep that deserves to be treated much better, with more brains.   If you are looking for serious sci-fi concerning space travel and the sense of discovering (not in a particular order): Alien, 2001 (even 2010), Solaris, Star Trek II, Silent Running; The Cube movies and Event Horizon, combines much better the slashing and the sci-fi, at least in those movies it has sense.  Final conclusion: Sunshine could have been so much better.

1400063515|5.0|For any serious person thinking about tomorrow (and beyond) this is a must read.  The basic idea, i.e. that much futurist analysis is trapped in Gaussian thinking when the real world changers are found in the \\"fat tails\\" of the unexpected is straightforward.  While Taleb is a serious mathematician, the book is readily accessible to the layman.  He is literate and writes brilliantly with a wry sense of humor that makes the book a pleasure to read.  The examples are well researched, and the lessons are thought provoking.  One of the best reads in years.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I understand why MGM re-invented the James Bond franchise. The new James Bond is a realistic agent that actually looks like he could fight terror. Unlike the Bonds of yesteryear Daniel Craig's James Bond comes across as a brute killing and fighting machine. I really liked this two disc DVD,which looked beautiful on my outdated 1080i component cable setup. The fighting, chasing,and love scenes were very well written. The movie scenes where James Bond travels the world looked amazing. Sound quality was also great. Daniel Craig naysayers eat your hearts out. Daniel Craig is James Bond and he delivered a solid performance in this great movie. I like this movie so much I'm thinking about getting it on Blu-ray as well.

B000HA4WT8|4.0|I wanted to see this movie in the theaters last year but didn't get to it. They have been showing it on cable non stop and I have watched it about 15 times. I enjoyed this movie. Unlike some reviewers I think moving the story to Japan was a great idea. The series needed a change. The movie is like need for speed underground 2. Compared to the others it is very slick, most of the racing takes place at night, and lets face it the drifting just looks cool. Yes the story is fake. How does an American go over to Japan and become the new drift king especially since he had never heard of drifting until he got there. But, see you have to enjoy the movie for what they are giving you. The movie is not about the characters it is about the cars. Think about it for all the people that went to see Transformers did you go see that to see people talk or robots transform. You know the answer. Enjoy the cars women and drifting and enjoy the show. There is one character I liked Hahn was a pimp and cool as s..t. Best character in the movie.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|I've never read Ayn Rand's source novel but I thoroughly enjoyed the film of \\"The Fountainhead\\".  I think one has to put the film in perspective of it's time.  I came out in the wake of what some perceived as the excesses of the New Deal and may have been a refreshing challenge to the accepted norms.  Watching the film I can't help to think that it anticapated the philosophy of Barry Goldwater.  Personally, I came of age under Ronald Reagan which I found to be a more satisfying compromise.  That is to say the rights of the individual are respected but informed by Judeo-Christian values.  Rand's uncompromising philosophy does not seem to be informed by a godliness.  That's where I differ with in that I think one can be true to oneself withouting eschewing altruism.  In a nutshell I respect this film without accepting all of the tenets it espouses.  This had to be a difficult film to make because of it's philosophical nature.  Director King Vidor pulls it off brilliantly working from a script by Rand and some stunning visual work.  The entire cast is terrific with a towering performance by Gary Cooper as Rand's everyman(Superman?).  Some would dismiss this film because of it's philosophy.  I think one has to take a page from Howard Roark and agree to disagree but respect the right of the individual to express themself.

B000068OCS|5.0|If you can show a little patience for the first 18 minutes of this film, it will suddenly become very entertaining as well as informative about our world. It's a totally wordless collage of great camera effects which I wouldn't doubt, probably set the stage for using time-lapse filming and dramatic slow motion effects of the simple things that we may have never put in such perspective before.<br /><br />After the initial start of the film, we see a world before man has put his hands to it.  We see God's creation as it can be today, as it was probably a million years ago.  Philip Glass offers a great musical score to the visuals of this entire film.  You see the beauty of the natural earth, and then suddenly, we see man starting to cut into it, build on it, expand man's existence upon it, and definitely alter the beauty of what it once was.  But, do we have a choice?  Technology must prevail and it certainly does as this film shows you.  But how much technology is enough?  How much is too much?  As we continue to grow and take from the earth, and deplete our earthly resources everyday, we are also returning our manufactured waste to the earth, which is in turn, polluting our earth.  But, what can we do?<br /><br />Man is destined to destroy itself and our mother earth and although it's nobody's fault, we have no choice but to either bury our waste or burn it.  Neither one benefits our planet.  This film of Koyaanisqatsi (filmed in 1983) inadvertently shows us the effects of \\"global warming\\" even before we gave this earthly disease a name.<br /><br />Watch this film, and then watch Al Gore's \\"The Inconvenient Truth\\" and hopefully someone with some tangible clout can stand up and make a difference for our future.  Will our grandchildren be wearing masks to breathe and skin protection from the sun?  That appears to be the direction that we are going.  Godfrey Reggio saw this even back in the 1970's.  This movie of Koyaanisqatsi warned us nearly 25 years ago.<br /><br />If anything though, this film is a lot of fun to watch.  And the music is great!  Also check out Godfrey Reggio's other two films \\"Powaqqatsi\\" and \\"Naqoyqatsi\\".  And also check out \\"Baraka\\", a film from the same cameraman Ron Fricke filmed just a few years ago that almost consolidates many of the ideas that you see in Godfrey Reggio's work.  \\"Powaqqatsi\\" has a fabulous soundtrack from Philip Glass also.his film is a lot of fun to watch.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|I watched a film today, oh boy<br />About a quiet man who wrote a book<br />And though the book did rather well<br />No one had time for laughs<br />They saw the photographs<br />Of people shot dead in their cars<br />They didn't know at first the killer's name<br />A group of letters soon appeared<br />He said he'd killed them all<br />Nobody was really sure if he was just leading them on<br /><br />I saw a film today, oh boy<br />About a killer named the Zodiac<br />And though the film was rather sad<br />Well I just had to look<br />Having missed the book<br />It really was quite long<br /><br />(to the tune of \\"A Day in the Life\\" by the Beatles)<br /><br />First of all, this movie is more like a crime documentary, focusing mainly on the tedious and labor intensive background work that went into the investigation of the murders that took place in the San Francisco Bay area in the sixties.  From the title, you already know that the killer is the infamous (and so far unidentified) Zodiac, and because the case is still unsolved, the ending is understandably vague.<br /><br />The next thing you should know is that it's a long movie that takes you step by step through the case from the shooting of Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau to the publication of Robert Graysmith's first book of the same name.<br /><br />It very effectively chronicles the personal and career upheavals of the main characters, especially the fixation of Graysmith (Sensitive guy Jake Gyllenhaal who's no stranger to obsessive roles), the dedication of Inspector David Toschi (a rumpled looking Mark Ruffalo) and the unpredictability of crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jnr. doing what he does best).<br /><br />At some points you can almost hear Graysmith's torment - \\"I wish I knew how to quit you Zodiac killer\\" - and at these moments you'll wish for Lilly Rush and the Cold Case team to come in and solve it once and for all. Recommended for people into true crime stories, but for obvious reasons you won't learn much more about Zodiac that you already know.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 5, 200707

1590171993|5.0|Every once in a while, a worthy but largely unknown novel registers on the literary radar screen and receives deserved attention. Dow Mossman's verbally hyperactive but extraordinary THE STONES OF SUMMER is one such example, rediscovered a few years ago by Mark Moskowitz's STONE READER documentary. John Williams's STONER is another, revitalized by Morris Dickstein's June 2007 paean in the New York Sunday Times Book Review. A thousand thanks, Mr. Dickstein - STONER is indeed a marvelous tale of American life and academia in the first half of the 20th Century.     Published in 1965, STONER was the second of Williams's three novels. Despite the date and serendipitous title, this is far from a beat or hippie generation story. To the contrary, hero William Stoner is a salt of the earth middle American, born and raised on a modest family farm in Missouri at the beginning of the 20th Century. Through intelligence, hard work, and good fortune, Stoner enters the University of Missouri to study modern agriculture. Williams presents his hero as a classically naïve farm boy, utterly awed by the buildings, the books, the other students, and the general aura of academe. All goes well until Stoner the freshman literature class of Archer Sloane. Despite being publicly embarrassed by Sloane for his inability to explain a Shakespearean sonnet about lost love (which also foreshadows his own later life), Stoner nevertheless discovers his true calling in literature. He changes majors, obtains his degree, and ultimately accepts a teaching position at his alma mater. One of his few good friends from the university, Dave Masters, subsequently describes the young Stoner with dead-on precision as \\"our own midwestern Don Quixote without his Sancho\\" - prophetic words, indeed. Most of Stoner's subsequent troubles in his professorial life arise from his quixotic insistence on intellectual purity and refusal to play academic politics. Although it takes him far too many years to learn how to fight back, he eventually proves to have some modest skills at windmill-tilting.    STONER the book traces the surprisingly tempestuous arc of Stoner the man's outwardly mundane life: friendships made and lost to wartime death, the ups and downs in a marriage of sexually naïve co-equals, the birth of a daughter, the triumphs and despairs of professional life, and the petty jealousies and irrational retaliatory behaviors engendered by academic politics. Williams presents the story of an intellectual idealist, but ultimately it is a story of failure. Failure in the real world to prevent young men from wasteful deaths in two world wars and Korea, failure of a marriage, failure in holding on to a true love, failure to establish a stable family life (Stoner's is classically dysfunctional), and failure as an intellectual in his chosen field. Williams offers Stoner a sole mitigating success as a teacher where, despite difficult departmental odds, he finds a moderate degree of satisfaction and life purpose.     Williams writes in a noticeably direct, matter-of-fact, third-person style. He minces no words in describing his characters, creating an environment that is at once realistic yet inescapably sad. The reader can only feel empathy bordering on pity for Stoner, his wife Edith, and their unfortunate daughter Grace (about whom one can only remark the misfortune that we cannot choose our parents). At age 42, Stoner \\"...could see nothing before him that he wished to enjoy and little behind him that he cared to remember.\\" What a despairing statement about one's own life. Yet, in the end, Stoner achieves a modicum of satisfaction and self-realization even as he surveys the unrealized expectations and potentialities of a life not so badly lived. He is a tragic hero, but a hero still and all. And a surprisingly likable one at that.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I agree i want the whole version of this film.The two movies seperate are not gonna have the same effct likr they did in movie theaters,it was cool having those trailers in between the two films,i wonder whats gonna happen with that either way its a must have for me cause ive seen the bootleg and its not that great.
B000HIVQD0|4.0|After reading the conflicting reviews of the sound quality here, I figured I'd throw mine in there too.<br />The original CD release was very thin sounding and unpleasant to listen to. This left a lot of room for improvement in a remastered reissue. Fortunately, the sound here is significantly better in terms of resolution and fullness, but it's not the quantum leap I'd hoped for. If you're a big Pretenders fan, you'll want to get this for the excellent bonus disk alone. If you're an audiophile simply looking for a better copy, I'd recommend it too - just don't expect any miracles.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I'm not gonna bore you with another long review,but if I was stranded on a desert island and I had only a few discs with me,Stevie Wonder's \\"Songs In The Key In The Life\\" would my top choices.So many great songs(Sir Duke,I Wish,Knocks Me Off My Feet,Summer Soft,Isn't She Lovely,As,Another Star,Love's In Need Of Love Today,Ebony Eyes,If It's Magic etc.)with no filler whatsoever.Plus the updated version(supervised by Harry Weinger and remastered by Kevin Reeves at Universial Mastering East)is excellent,with punchy,spacious,vibrant sound and all the original artwork,liner notes and lyrics included.Truly a must-have in every sense of the word!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|From the opening, I found this soundtrack surprising, unusual (for HP) and - ultimately - most refreshing. A new take on the Harry Potter movie universe that reflects the change in plot and character styles evident in Order Of The Phoenix.    I grew very fond of this work quite quickly. Knowing the story, I was initially taken aback by the sequence into which the pieces are organised (they do not follow the layout within the movie) but this does not justify any pertinent criticism.    The books have always conveyed a light-hearted impression of the world to which Harry is adjusting and this is reflected in the style of some of the pieces. As the books then inject a more cruel reality (in the guise of oppression, racism, selfishness, etc.) into this world, so too the music veers from light-hearted and humorous, sometimes through excitement (such as \\"Fireworks\\" - one of my favourites - and \\"Flight Of The Order Of The Phoenix\\"), into sympathy or intimidation.    With each new book, I have been impressed by the gradual maturation of the story and characters. Within this soundtrack, I was similarly impressed with the complex emotion conveyed through tracks such as \\"The Sacking Of Trelawney\\", \\"Possession\\"  and, most wonderfully, in \\"The Kiss\\" (another favourite). I think it lends maturity to a story that is 'coming of age'.    In one example, a light and pretty. theme is soon betrayed by its heavy and intimidating background. The character depicted by the piece is hidden and sugar coated - disguised with dainty frills, airy pinks - belying her fascist and sadistic tendencies. As is pointed out in the books, she is not necessarily evil; more extraordinarily authoritarian. I think this characterisation is reflected very nicely in \\"Professor Umbridge\\".    As a soundtrack should, this admirably fulfils the intention to support, enhance or even convey the personality of the image on screen. Earlier Potter themes are alluded to but the changes are a breath of fresh air. I am glad that we are no longer subject to the rehash of a six year old thematic concept.

The background information is wonderful and eye opening.    By listening to the commentary and the second DVD you will get so much more out of the movie.   The soundtrack is unforgettable and a must to own also.        This movie should be a must for families to view together.   It opens up conversations that should be opened.
B000CNFC76|4.0|This movie is a little heavy handed on the social-economic class issues.  At times the story drags because of this.  However, the casting is solid, and the cinematography is lovely.  Best of all is the real life story of Francis Ouimet.  Inspite of knowing almost nothing about golf, this movie has inspired me to research the real person. [[ASIN:B000FDFVYW The Greatest Game Ever Played: A True Story]] The Bonus feature showing the interview with the real Mr. Ouimet is a definite plus.
B000G759LW|4.0|I am not a big fan of the pop princess sounds, such as Britney, Jessica or even Avril, and thus I do not particularly care for most of Christina's work.  I will however say that Christina unlike the others has a very remarkable voice and I really enjoyed this album.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|Obviously, this is a masterpiece of classic rock and to hear it remastered with the correct speed (the original had a muddy and dull sound but I never knew why) and with lyrics that were buried in \\"Break on Through\\" and the then controversial \\"The End\\" make \\"The Doors\\" sound like the way they were supposed to be heard. The bonus tracks don't really add anything to it but who cares. More importantly, though for years people into punk dismissed this album, unfairly and put it in the same category as a lot of bloated dinosaur bands that punk was a reaction to. However, the influence of the Doors, especially the first album on post punk and goth with their dark and disturbing lyrics and sound cannot be understated, especially groups such as Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen (who actually did some Doors covers). As for punk a certain Jim Ostenberg was inspired by the Doors to take their confrontational stance to a higher level and form the Stooges under the name Iggy Pop. So really there is nothing not to like about this album. The albums that followed (except for \\"Strange Days\\", another classic could not leave up their debut (but what could?) and with the analog organ work by Ray Manzarek giving the album a jazz like quality, this is a perfect compliment to Jim Morrison's vocals. Anyway, this should be on everyone's top 100 list, if not top 10 list and deservedly so.
B000002OTL|5.0|It's a safe bet that the Soundtrack to any Tarantino movie won't disappoint, and Pulp Fiction delivers.  In addition to reviving the career of John Travolta, the movie resurrected many classic songs:  Kool and the Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie\\", Dusty Springfields, \\"Son of a Preacher\\" and the Statler Brothers, \\"Flowers on a Wall\\" were invigorated by the movie.    With classic lines from the movie spliced in (\\"In France, it's a Royale with Cheese\\") it brings back the best of the movie.  Certainly a great CD for the car CD player when the movie's not available.

A must have in any CD collector's library.
B000002KKK|5.0|This is the album where ZZ Top showed they had what it takes to move from Southern Blues-Rock stars to Pop Mega-stars.  In many ways, the album is a transition.  Dust My Broom (whose royalty disputes kept the album out of the 6 pack) is a classic Elmore James Blues tune.  Three tracks later, Cheap Sunglasses is the \\"hint\\" of what's to come - it could've just as easily been in their pop break-out Eliminator.  The album has breadth as well - like many classic ZZ Top albums, it's not a single surrounded by filler.  I Thank You is a classic Sam and Dave cover with the unique ZZ Top sound.  I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide is their call to the world that they do have broader ambitions than honky tonks in Texas.    In all it's a great album for ZZ Top fans, as well as others interested in the cross-over between Southern Blues Rock and Mainstream Pop.  (Listeners of Stevie Ray Vaughn, Skynnyrd and Marshall Tucker would all find plenty to enjoy)

B000LC55F2|4.0|\\"The Prestige\\" is a very entertaining, gripping film, which is rare for me these days, as sometimes I'm more tempted to stop a dull movie and go after more worthwhile pursuits. But \\"The Prestige\\" kept me hanging and watching. It has the same dark, human taste as Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins,\\" but does seem to be lacking.    While I would recommend \\"The Prestige\\" to anyone looking for an afternoon's or evening's entertainment, I really wish it had been more tightly edited. This prevents it from being a great movie. First of all, the title of \\"The Prestige\\" is given away, willy-nilly, in the first five minutes of the movie as Michael Caine explains the axes on which magic operates. There seems to be absolutely no character development--Angier (H. Jackman) is angry, Borden (C. Bale) is angry, and both seem to be two sides of the same coin, but we don't even know what the coin is like. While they do have some motivations, we have no idea what they're like. They appear out of the blue. Later revelations in the movie make the character motivations even more vague. Nolan's choice to cast two men who appear physically similiar makes a statement--but what is that statement? I had no idea who I supported as the movie went on, and even at the end I had no favorite character. The scant information the audience is given means there are no sympathies on either side. The only character I was truly sympathetic with was the little girl, and only because she was a little girl. I'm not sure she even spoke.     At first, it is very difficult to understand the muddied chronology, as the story goes back and forth between Angier and Borden reading each other's diaries. There's a great deal of overlap--perhaps some sort of focus for transition would have made it less confusing.     Michael Caine seems sadly underemployed as he appears in bit parts. Happily, he does have more of a character than he did in \\"Batman Begins,\\" but he could have been a great supporting character. The same is for David Bowie, who plays the marvelously disappointing Tesla.    While you may figure out some of the plot as you go along, you'll feel compelled to keep watching--and then you'll probably realized you did not solve the ending. It's a good movie with great twists and turns, but seems disjointed at times and largely underdeveloped. Entertaining, but it's not going to win an Oscar.

B000RJO578|4.0|I purchased this movie based entirely on the fact that it was brought to us by the team who made \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", one of my favorite movies.  While \\"Hot Fuzz\\" does not quite meet my expectations, it stands on its own as a very funny mystery action comedy.  It doesn't quite have the great timing that \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is known for, nor does it have as many hilarious quotes, but I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more and more.  Being a British comedy the humor is very dry and subtle compared to American films so you may have to watch it once or twice to catch everything, but its worth it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action films, comedies, mysteries, or \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  Just be warned that there are a few scenes with a lot of blood and gore, though they are brief (maybe a minute of actual gore per violent scene at the most).  I don't mind them but I wasn't expecting them.

B000P2A256|5.0|The best advice I can give for \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is that to get your money's worth, you have to be willing to listen to it a lot. For example, the first time I listened, I was sad because I didn't like it - at all. The second time, I figured - hey, I really like these guys, I'll give them another chance, and with that attitude it wasn't so bad. The third, fourth, and fifth listenings went on, and it has been the only cd I've listened to for two weeks. This is an excellent cd!!

B00005JPLW|2.0|i do not understand the appeal of watching video game like graphics telling the story of the spartans against the persians.. I especially do not understand this in combination with one of the cheesiest soundtracks ever written and some of the most over the top narration and dialogue.. This is a film which sets out to appeal to a young male audience and neglects the potential of its own plot elements.. It is like watching someones' barbaric fantasies without having any stable ground to stand on and it is a thourough waste of time..<br />I think they tried to make up for the visual and audio lack of substance by trying to sell the historic points of the story.. but this only makes the movie look more off balance - like a poor rendition of gladiator..<br />I would recommend this movie to young gamer types but i would strongly caution any true fans of cinema against this movie..

0316067598|4.0|However one may feel about war, our current one or any other,the accounts of men at war have been a significant part of literature. This is not great literature, or even very good literature, but it is decent writing and a stirring read.
0618680004|5.0|Flying monkeys and men of straw?  Are you quite mad?  How can people believe in such rubbish?  Or perhaps I'm thinking of some other book entirely.    Okay facetiousness aside, I don't really see the difference between teaching our children to believe in the Bible rather than some other work of fantasy such as, for instance, The Wizard of Oz.  The former has tin men and evil witches, the latter talking snakes and fiery chariots.  What's the difference?  And what if all our churches, temples and synagogues were to become dedicated to the mighty wizard who dwells \\"somewhere over the rainbow\\", would not the total insanity of religion stare at us full in the face?, especially if we were told that if we were all good little boys and girls we would all go to live in the land of Oz for ever and ever - some quicker than others if they chose to become suicide bombers for the great and mighty wizard.    Dawkins book has been criticised by some theologians because they say he has no knowledge of theology nor of current philosophical debate on the subject of religion.  He is, after all, just a scientist, and what do they know with their bunsen burners and test-tubes?  But going back to my Oz example, isn't that like saying Dawkins knows nothing of the land of Oz, its people, it's climate and geography, and as such we should not take his pernicious cynicism seriously?    Another point made by religious thinkers (there's an oxymoron for you) is what would happen to morality if there was no Bible, Koran etc?  Well, speaking personally I've never felt the need to consult a guide book to teach me right from wrong. I already know that flying planes into buildings full of people or sodomising alter boys or bombing a third-world country just to steal their oil is wrong. The insanity of religion is that despite having their divinely inspired guide book they still go ahead and break every commandment God gave them.    I think this book should be read, not as science versus religion, butas thinking versus non-thinking.  Few would argue that the two greatest qualities that we, as a species, possess is our capacity to love and our ability to think.  Religion may at least try (and usually fail) to encourage the former but where it really lets us down is with the latter, actively discouraging us from using our brains and in effect making a virtue of stupidity and ignorance.  But if God really did make us, and He made us with an inquisitive temperament and questioning mind, should we then be threatened with eternal hell-fire for using it?    I remember my psychoanalysis teacher at university telling us at our very first class: \\"Psychoanalysis is about making people unhappy.  It does this by freeing them of their delusions.\\"    So read this book, with an open mind if possible, and you too can be unhappy.
0143038419|5.0|I liked this book a lot and really enjoyed \\"visiting\\" regions that I have never been to or really plan on going to. I too thought the book was a little whiney, but not enough to take away from the eloquent writing and scenic style. I bought this with \\"A Beautiful Bucket of Bones\\" by M. Luci and was amazed at how similar they were (both go through Italy, both focus on prayer and faith, and both, of course are driven by the hope of Love). If I had to suggest one or the other to someone, I am not sure which I would choose. Instead, I would say: suck up the 600 combined pages and read both. In my opinnion, you can never read too much about beauty and love.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|My wife and I watched this film last night and found it to be both entertaining and moving, exciting and emotional, passionate and touching...the list is endless. One of the best we have ever seen (maybe that's why we love THE WARRIORS so much).    It looks like nothing you have ever seen before.  The visuals, the driving score, the realistic yet comic style, over blown violence of battle, the love story, the betrayals.    There are not many films that I would say are unique, but this is one of them.  Zack Snyder does quite well considering that it seems that every frame of this movie is a direct lift from frank Miller's original drawings (minus the full frontal male nudity, though there was more than enough beefcake on display to bring a happy smile to my wife! Huh! I am in shape...'round' is a shape...isn't it..?)    Buy this film, it is a must.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Frank Miller has always been one of my favorite comic book writters. He is a great narrator and imaginative story teller. One thing that the brave men who decide to tackle his storys for film know is that they cannnot mold it to the likings of cinema. When Sin City was brought to the big screen I was amazed at how the story was told page for page narritive to action sequence. The breakthrough green screen filming is what totally did it for Frank Miller's story and now it was time to bring another of his masterpieces to the big screen.<br /><br />300 is such an incredible specticle. The story is brilliant as well as the cast. The bullet time fighting sequences are mind blowing. In all of its gore and glory you can't look away and anything that is placed in front of your eyes. This is a movie that you might not get the same thrill of through DVD alone. But if you saw this movie on the big screen you will enjoy it either way.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Why did it take so long for a GOOD Batman movie to come along?  It's not that I don't appreciate the talents of the past attempts, or the actors who have graced the script/screen.  I mean, once you've seen Henry and June, you pretty much fall in love with Uma Thurman forever.  (I even bought, yes bought, the Producers just to hear her speak another language) - And who doesn't like Jack Nicholson.  Arnold was a bit much, as well as Jim Carey, but I have a 30-something soft spot for Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.  All this being said - Batman Begins was what I was always personally looking for, and it delivered.  For 5 stars, I want to see the Batman that Frank Miller speaks of - a broken man, a drunk, a failure!  Bring on the drama!
B000R9J3X4|5.0|In the post grunge era of the late 90's right before the explosion of pop and mainstreem hip-hop there was one band that didn't want to let go of the glory days of the first half of the decade. That band was Garbage. Garbage combined haunting Annie Lennox like vocals from the stunning Shirley Manson hard tuned down guitar rifts and just a pinch of slight new wave and created one easily recognizible sound for the time. I was eagerly awaiting this grestest hits and the best part is this special edition with a whole addition cd of remixes. The best part about the remix cd is that its not all the same songs as on the first disc. So pretty much all of the songs of Garbage that I loved are all here so I got my moneys worth entirely. If you are a fan of this band it is a worthy addition to your collection if you are looking for something different or trying to get into the band more its a great starter.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Awesome.  Aside from sin city, this is the best comic-to-movie translation (having not read anything prior to the film.)  Also, it had a good story and a clear message that wasn't ruined by some fantastic hollywood one liners.

0679746048|4.0|There were several things I liked about this book.  It had short chapters, so the story flowed.  It was a lot different than the movie (and I think better).  It exposes the lengths Hollywood goes to in \\"adapting\\" a story for film.  I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a quick read (maybe two or three sittings).  Kaysen is real with her thoughts and shocking when telling about the other patients in the ward.  I like the addition of copies of some pages from her case file!  They were so sparsely worded but enough to commit her.  It makes me think about the state of the mental health system in the 1960's!  It seemed all too easy for her to be \\"locked away.\\"  You can really see her brilliant mind at work in this book.  I definitely recommend it for people interested in studying mental illness.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|I rarely feel a film is bad enough to actually bother writing a review of it, however the only positive thought I can come up with about this film is that the lighting was good.  This is a simple murder thriller that gives away the ending within the first 15 minutes of the film.   It starts by showing that the murderer himself is a genious with the ability to find the slightest flaw in anything. His career shows this and his story of his childhood backs it up.  We are also presented with a lawyer that admits early that his near perfect prosecution record is because he trades other lawyers in the DA office his losing cases. But still, he appears bright enough to know from the start when he's working on a winner or a loser.  The problem is, the key plot point, which is the inability to find the murder weapon was so incredibly obvious, that anyone with the ability to tie their own shoelaces should have seen where the weapon was, the entire time. I won't go into details to spoil the film further, but the fact is, the director and camera man makes it so you'd have to be in the bathroom at the time to miss it. They placed far too much importance on the weapon that you were forced to follow its path the entire time.  It was obvious from the beginning of the case that Hopkin's would in fact win the case on the technicality that the murder weapon is missing and that his signed confession can be considered coerced (again, won't spoil it too much here). Also, since the entire future of the prosecture depends on him winning this case, it's obvious that he'd have to lose it and make a come-back somehow. Since this is laid out so early in film, again, the winning plot point, the defendant depending on double-jeopardy, would also have to be his downfall. It's obvious that their would have to be some sort of related loophole related to double jeopardy allowing the prosectuter to make a come back.  So, then again, within the earliest part of the film, the defendant is made aware that the \\"killing shot\\" from his gun was not in fact killing and that the victim would survive on life support made it obvious that the terms of double jeopardy would apply only so long as the charge of attempted murder remained attempted muder. This means for the prosecuter to be able to spoil Hopkins' plan, the victim would have to die, therefore changing the charge from attempted murder during the first trial to murder on the second trial.  So, the only surprise during the entire film was how she would die, not if, or even when. This means, that you are forced to watch an hour and 10 minutes following the entire story being given away to find out if she dies naturally or is helped along. And then you watch the last 10 minutes just to make sure you were right about the plot in the first place.  The part that made it sadest is that the defendant chose to take the victim (his wife) off of life support before leaving the country. This is what made me dislike the film the most, because in his intelligent, cold and calculating fashion, it was obvious anyone capable of seeing \\"The next step\\" so well would easily have never made this mistake and if he in fact did, then it wasn't film-worthy in to begin with since he really wasn't that intelligent to begin with. After all, he scientifically calculated every single step to his case, he would obviously understood that double jeopardy was inapplicable since he was charged with attempted murder and not murder.  So, I believe that before producing this film, the writer should have been forced to reorder the timeline to make the discovery of the primary plot points occur over a great time-span. The writer should also have chosen an alternative method for the \\"master plan\\" of the Hopkins' character to get busted in the end. It just didn't work the way it was written.  In my opinion, if you still chose to buy this film, I recommend that you do it to enjoy an excellent example of set lighting, the crew in charge of set lighting did afabulous job and should be commended for their excellent efforts.

B00005JKG7|5.0|The Fog is my all-time favorite ghost story.  Nothing before or since has had the same visceral appeal as John Carpenter's The Fog.  It has a captivating storyline, perfect northern California coastal setting, and a cast of well-known and not so well-known actors, who's performances make The Fog all that more enticing.    This was filmed before CGI effects and mega-buck explosions became all the rage.  I find that the acting/directing should carry the movie; Not what is done to it on computer months later.  The Fog excels here.  John Carpenter's musical score is simple, haunting and really sets the mood.    For those who can't watch 10 minutes of film without an explosion or special effects, The Fog is not for you.  More sophisticated viewers will enjoy the movie.  I can only suggest this:  Wait til it's dark, close your blinds, turn up the volume, and prepare to be enveloped by THE FOG.  It's a spectacularly creepy movie.

My sons are 11 and 14; both eligible to have fought in the war where Beah lost his childhood.  It made me think - and up my charitable contributions.<br /><br />In my opinion, everyone should read this book (I'm giving it five stars), but it did leave me wanting to hear more.  Perhaps the editor was too aggressive, maybe Beah didn't want to say more, who knows...  But I was left thinking that there was more to say.  I hope that we hear more from him one day.

However, this movie is NOT Pride and Prejudice by any stretch of the imagination!  Perhaps, if they had given it a different title and not tried to pretend that it was Pride and Prejudice, I could give it more stars in its own right!  I can't imagine how ANYONE who has read and loves the book can possibly even LIKE this movie!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|What David Lynch accomplishes with \\"Inland Empire\\" is nothing less than the re-imagination of an art form. By the end of the film, he's managed to strip away all of the superficial conventions of the genre (plot cohesiveness, realistic character development, and eventually comprehensibility itself...), leaving behind only the fantastic and frightening vision that fueled its creation. There's no journey quite like Inland Empire, and most audience members will undoubtedly find very little to like about it. However, if you're willing to surrender your rational mind to the strange currents that drive this film, you're sure to be changed irrevocably. In any case, Laura Dern's raw and powerful performance is in itself worth the price of a ticket...

1932907009|4.0|If you are an aspiring screenwriter, this is a quick read and gives you one slant on the basics of screenwriting.  However, I would read other books or take an online class to get a more broad perspective on writing screenplays.  The \\"grain of salt\\" refers to the fact that Snyder has only one movie to his credit, Blank Check (of which he freely admits), so you have to be careful with just how seriously you take his advice to heart.  There are many other great books out there in Amazon-land that do a much more thorough, and realistic job of teaching you about writing for the blockbuster movie.  \\"The Idiot's guide to Screenwriting\\" by Skip Press is just one good example, and more practical.  Nonetheless, I would still recommend this in your reading repertoire.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|NOTE: This review refers to the deluxe two-disc edition of the movie.  For some reason, Amazon just lumps them in with the regular edition.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I shelled out for the deluxe edition, if only because of the Hellblazer comic that's included with the package.  I was hoping the extras would add more in the way of explanations for some of what happens in the film, but they don't.  This is why the entire package loses one star.  Particularly aggravating is the commentary from Akiva Goldsman and the director.  Goldsman's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard.  I eventually had to turn off the commentary because I couldn't take the noise anymore.  The extras on the second disc are diverting, and it's nice to learn more about the comic, but it also settles for being superficial instead of tackling some of the deeper issues that underlie this deliciously creepy story.
B00002EPJH|5.0|This album is simply breathtakingly lovely!  A gem from start to finish, this CD is a moving tribute to the piano's ability to establish a mood of calm serenity and peace.  Keith Jarrett had already established his place in my heart as one of the great jazz pianists of all time, even before I bought and listened to The Melody At Night, With You.  This album showcases his elegantly lyrical side. One can admire his craft: his intelligently balanced emotional/intellectual approach here, knowing when to be simple and understated, knowing just how to voice the chords and progressions.  However, as a hopelessly romantic man and musician myself, I enjoy reveling in the tender atmosphere of the music as a whole, the yearning, poignant depictions of the moments which are all too fleeting, and which pass by each of us in the journey of life, too rarely acknowledged or even realized.  Thank you, Keith, for this gift!
B00005JMK0|5.0|i remembered this movie just now, while browsing around for something...i don't really know what triggered the memory but there it is. This movie--what a nice 'flavor' of the eighties; a love story wrapped in the innocence we use to have as then. This kind of thing should be preserved and made available to the public (DVD), if not for history, then for the mere purpose of sentimental nostalgia.    Computers buff will be fascinated of then, the early infusion of personal computers into our lives, say if i could, a marker of where we have been; now, isn't that worth seeing--computers are so much a part of our lives, it's hard to say if we can carry on without it...impossible!    Boy was i disappointed to learn it's not on DVD. i'd like to say 'shame on Amazon' (i know it's not they're fault, but they should insist to whomever and get this movie on DVD--and since we're here; i would extend that to Win Wenders' Lisbon Story)  Amazon, Why? and Why not?
B000NVIXFK|4.0|i've been a huge Rush fan for decades and i wasn't even going to get this new album, as their last couple of albums haven' been particularly inspiring.  lucky for me my girlfriend knows how much i like Rush and bought this disc for me on my birthday. THANKS!  This is the best Rush has sounded in a veryyyyyy long time. I've seen them several times live in the last couple of years and they never fail to put on a great show, but recent disks were a different story. If you like older Rush or just dig good rock, this is a very satisfying disc.  While this is no 2112 and there's no \\"working man\\" track on here, strong songs abound.  Getty's voice isn't what it used to be, but he uses it well and doesn't strain to try and do what he really can't anymore.  Alex Lifeson's guitarwork is back to nice form, nothing fancy but a really nice sound like he did for years and years.  Peart's songwriting is particularly refreshing, his strong lyrics have sadly (and understandably) been missing for at least three albums.  All and all a very unexpected treat, especially the instrumental pieces.  If you're a Rush fan - buy it NOW!  If you like rock, give it a listen - there's alot here to appreciate.
B000QXDED6|1.0|I was just waiting for the end of the movie. They should creat an award for boring moving. Some scene in the movie showing lesbians in action.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I have to think that people who moan and groan and give movies one star because they don't think it looks good on blu-ray are using substandard equipment. If you are looking at blu-ray using a 480 or 720i TV and component cables, no movie is going to look all that great. I'm using HDMI and 1080i tv and the movie both looks fantastic and sounds great.<br /><br />This movie was a fun ride, but as even better movies come out on blu-ray it will probably be forgotten.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Almost always, like in a three act play the second part of a trilogy is a waiting game.  Things will happen to explain what was missed in the first part and there will be the inevitable lead up to the third and last part.  In the Borne Supremacy (Ludlum had always planned this as a trilogy) there is no let down, in fact the action gets even more compelling and leaves hardly a body alive at the end.      Once again, Treadstone, has come back to haunt Bourne.  After two years of being on the run with Marie, he has been tracked down. But who is after him? It doesn't appear to be the CIA, so someone else is trying to clean up their own loose ends.  The mole in the CIA is still there, but who was he working with and why?  Bourne goes back into action to find out why he has been set up to look like the murderer of two CIA agents in Berlin.  He knows some one is after him, but they also want the CIA after him.  If the agents they send after him are really lucky, they won't find him.    There are three great stunt scenes in this one, one in India, one in Berlin and then a phenomenal one in Moscow that at one point looks like the chase scene at the end of \\"Blues Brothers\\".  My questions on this one are as follows: 1) why does he always travel under his Bourne name?, 2) why does he never take any time to change his appearance?, 3) why doesn't he ever change out of that totally black outfit, and 4) how come he never seems to need a shave?
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Great album as a whole.  This really does show off Mayer's musicianship and creativity with the Trio.  The maturity shown from Mayer's performance in this CD is refreshing and fills the listener with quite a bit of excitement and surprise.  His solo in Gravity put a smile on my face, immediately pushing me to show it off to my friends.      The album isn't flawless, as there are annoying Mayer obsessors with Pre-adult screeches scattered throughout the album, but appreciating the musical aspect of the album makes it well worth the buy.
B000286RKW|5.0|Quite simply one of the best films ever made, and now its available on a proper DVD (i.e. not double sided).<br />Based on the true story of Henry Hill it covers his life as gangster from young lad to middle-age. The film has everything, the script and direction are perfect and the performances from the cast are outstanding. For a film that 2 hours and 19 mins long, not a moment is wasted.<br />Scorcese peaked with this film and although he has made worthy and noteable films since, none match this one. Scene after memorable scene occurs, the killing in the bar, entering the nightclub (the famous long shot) and perhaps best of all the 'funny guy' scene.<br />Scorcese frequently refereneces other films and I wonder if the scene where Henry attacks the guy with the butt of his gun is a direct reference to The Godfather when Sonny beats up his sisters boyfriend.<br />In an interview Scorcese said that at the end of the 80's there were a lot of films coming out with fast cutting, and this film was his response \\"you wanna it fast - lets make it really fast\\". Nowhere is this felt more than near the end when the pace of the film reflects Henrys high on cocaine.<br />The extras on the special edition are pretty good, but you shouldn't be buying this film for the extras. Go treat yourself, a film like this doesn't happen very often and its an essential purchase.

B000P0J024|4.0|Arrrggghh...I must be getting old, but I have a place in my heart for alternative rock, having grown up in the 80's (born 1970) and remembering when REM, U2, the Cure, Depeche Mode, the Smiths, Joy Division (etc.) were truly \\"alternative rock.\\"  Well anyway, Amazon has classified this excellent Traveling Wilburys set as \\"alternative rock,\\" which I just don't understand.  I bet that Roy, Tom, Bob, Jeff, and George had no idea they were getting together to record an \\"alternative rock\\" album (I'm sure they were highly influenced by Bauhaus and Nine Inch Nails and such).  OK, off my soapbox for now, but I do recall LOVING the first Wilburys album when it came out (especially Handle with Care, such a terrific tune and one that was recently covered lovingly by Jenny Lewis)...\\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" was a great Dylan tune skewering Springsteen...these guys were at the top of their game for the first CD.  The second one was inevitably a letdown, but still had a few good songs.  This was one of the more fun \\"supergroup\\" projects ever (the key: they did NOT take themselves too seriously on here).
0061122416|2.0|If you are young and need touchy-feely books, this would be a book for you.   Although a few may be inspired by this book, I really didn't think it was worthwhile. Life is what you make it, many people write about it, and after you have read about this concept a few times, it is rather boring. \\"The Alchemist\\" doesn't keep your interest and doesn't say anything new.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Total enjoyment. The photography is so beautiful I play it like a screensaver on my televison.
B000J103PC|1.0|Ok, if you're under 20, this could have been entertaining.    Meryl Streep is an exceptional talent..... Really she is - just not here.
B000002JSP|2.0|The only tune on this mess worth giving a second listening is \\"Hot Dog\\".  If you like burning your own CD's, it's a good one to put in the mix.  The boys were burned out by this point. It happens. Sad, but it happens.  First it's the sophmore jinx, then the burn out.  Zep fan forever!,  Bill
0440180295|3.0|A different story of the life of Billy Pilgrim. After you get in to it, the book is sort of riveting, although confusing. The book is about Billy Pilgrim, POW,  who goes goes back and forth through life, marrigae, job, etc., in atypical order that takes place over and over - in a Twilight Zone style. Pilgrim lives in traumatic devastating times and seems to never connect. A repeated line in this novel, \\"And so it goes,\\" is a bit over-done and appears to say \\"whatever\\" accept it and move on.  Vonnegut's  Slaughterhouse Five - accept it and move on.
B000002J0B|5.0|When i first heard this in the 70's, I had to see the cover for proof it  was really Zep! They went close to 180 on this one, and it worked.  Bill
B00027JYLC|5.0|FREAKS! It's one of a kind. FREAKS! Boggles the imagination<br />FREAKS! Not to be missed. FREAKS! I'm already one so how<br />bad can it be(don't answer that). Freaks is a wonderful film<br />it was made in 31 and released in 32. It's the story of<br />circus/sideshow performers and their lives. You have the caterpiller<br />man who roles his cigs. with his teeth. Two sisters who are joined<br />at the hip,one is married and the other one had just got engaged<br />to whereas the fiance say's to the other sis.husband..I guess<br />I'll be seeing you around! You have the real life dual sex person<br />one actor comments..I guess she likes you,but he don't referring<br />to the same person was funny. This is a movie and in no way a<br />documenatary on SPECIAL people. It did not last long at the box<br />office,and was banned in ENGLAND for over 20 years. This movie<br />has a heart and soul of it's own. Alejandro Jodorsky has stated<br />in a book on film,that this is one of his FAV. Rarely screened<br />in the states,it has a cult status of it's own. And was voted<br />number 1 cult film of ALL time. Come watch the LIL person<br />pour his heart out to the beautiful trapeze artist..just to<br />just to...Well I don't want to give away the ending now do I.<br />NO! You'll just have to buy the movie that John Waters said<br />ONE OF A KIND. YOU LOVE DAVID LYNCH?  YOU LOVE KEN RUSSELL?<br />YOU LOVE ANDY WARHOL? YOU LOVE TERRY GILLIAM? THEN MY FRIEND<br />YOU WILL LOVE FREAKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JSN|3.0|This was good, but just didn't have enough Zep for two CD's.  Lots of highlights, however. Great example of the glitter rock era.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|look, i was pissed as anyone when i first started hearing all the negative reviews being a big pumpkins fan. but when i actually listened to the album, i could see where they were coming from. seriously now people, you cant tell me this comes even close to any of their previous albums (except maybe machina). its a pure and pretty ordinary pop-rock album with little personal energy, passion or thought put into it. its just a manufactured album put together for the sake of it. dont just be loyal! it seriously lacks any of the substance and emotion and progression of previous pumpkins songs and albums, i was very dissapointed. a lot of the songs lack a hook or anything memorable about it, and some are quite annoying really. the riffs are solid in parts, but on the whole this album really does not rock and the vocals in parts are quited flawed. seriously, if this album were put out by anyone else but the smashing pumpkins, it would not have people giving it 5 stars. it is very ordinary, i could hear the same on any other anonoymous rock band's album. did he take a new direction? if so, i dont like it personally as i dont think as much work or imagination was put into it. it seemed rushed, and just a money making venture. and dont worry i was as big a pumpkin fan back in the day just as much as the next man and it hurts me to say it. i cant believe the same man who was behind gish, siamese dream, mellon collie and the infinate sadness and even adore could put this very bland and simple album together....the choruses especially lack anything special about them and the the sadness, the anger, the joy, the darkness and the musical and guitar progressions that was present in almost every pumpkin song released previously is not really here. guys, this is no masterpiece....it is a very ordinary album that does not represent the pumpkins i came to know and love. so yes, i am disappointed and everyone i know personally has agreed whole-heartedly with me. dont give 5 stars out ofloyalty !! minus about 3 songs, its pretty terrible really
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I'm not a JLo fan and she does ok in this one (not the best but it's passable) but this movie is great!  Loved the storyline, loved the characters (Stanley Tucci is a hoot!) etc.<br /><br />A wonderful, warm movie.  I'm not a crier but I actually cried when Richard Gere met Susan Sarandon at her workplace w/ a rose and the Peter Gabriel song was playing in the background!<br /><br />Check it out.  It's a good family film.<br /><br />DWTS addicts, you can see Tony Dovolani and Karina Smirnoff (Mario Lopez's girlfriend) in the movie.  Tony was the obnoxious dancer in the competition and Karina was the girl that danced w/ Stanley T. at the studio.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is a must watch movie of the year. Full of non-stop action. Great for any addition of epic battle movies. Highly recommended.
B000002VCB|1.0|What are people thinking. This is APP worst album. Theres not one song by eric woolfson on here at all. And its really forgetable. IF you want a good APP cd get Turn of a friendly card.. Don't start with this one.     This has got some pretty whipped up thrown together bad songs on here.
1582701709|5.0|I think some people are getting the wrong idea. If you assume that by just wishing for something with no action behind it is the secret, you are absolutely right. It's the secret to absolute failure. However, I do not believe that this was the message here. I compare the universe to the basic operation of a computer. When we boot up, our C drive spins with all the information it has available to us. Picture this as the universe. Then we download a specific program {Word or Photo Shop etc.) to facilitate whatever we need to do. All the data in the C drive is spinning and accessible to us, but the specific program selects and only picks what it wants and places it on the screen. Picture this as our intentions, our wishes, or our mental visualizations selecting and picking out from the universe the manifestations we desire in our lives. However, and this is the key, like the program on our computer screen, it will not write that Pulitzer Prize winning novel or edit that award winning photograph for you. Nevertheless, it will give you all the tools and options like the universe. Once it has our intentions it will give us the ideas, opportunities and the means to attain whatever it is we wish to actualize. But we are the ones that have to bring our ideas to light, seize the opportunities that are presented to us and utilize the means that the universe provides us to employ. This is the secret!     Is it new? Absolutely not. Deepak Chopra said it a thousand times already in his \\"Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,\\" and his many other books and audios. Viktor Frankl (Author/Psychiatrist) said that the only reason he survive the Nazi death camps was his belief and conviction that he would live to tell the tale. Rumi and Gandhi professed it and please lets not forget Jesus, \\"Ask and it will be given you\\" and \\"What you truly believe will come to pass.\\"     The car and bicycle scene was a little over the top. However, was it presented in a new and impressive way? Did it keep my attention? Did it add a new twist, touch or nuance to this old secret? Yes! Yes! And Yes! Personally, I can't get enough of this stuff!   Author Richard Louis

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I stumbled onto Amon Amarth a few years ago, and this is my favorite of their albums that I have found so far. I'm not a musician so I won't try to impress you with all the musical terms, I'll just tell you what I like and why. My favorite song on here is Gods of War Arise, it's such a great song. Not too fast, not too slow, awesome lyrics, very memorable. Other great songs on here are Cry of the Blackbirds, because it's such a great description of an ancient battle that you feel yourself getting swept up in it, and Prediction of Warfare. Also, I really like Under the Northern Star.. it's a slow song, but it's awesome. This song more than any others really gets across the mood and lets you imagine sailing along in a wooden Viking ship through a frigid ocean to do battle. I think that of their recent albums this one represents a high water mark that may not be matched for a while. Definitely worth the price of buying it.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I have been wanting to buy the Nun's Story because I have had it on video for a long time, so when I got the DVD, I was very happy with it.

Thank you so much, Amazon, for selling a great product!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I've been fascinated with sniper-type action ever since reading the book JARHEAD.  Since I prefer to enjoy movies in front of my own DVD player instead of in noisy, crowded, expensive theaters, I hadn't tracked this movie and didn't know anything about it.  But, what the heck, I decided to spend $20 and take a chance.  Am I ever glad I did!  It's quite a yarn; satisfying and enjoyable.  I watch movies for two reasons:  to escape the stress of daily life and be entertained.  This does it!  This one's a keeper and worth watching several times.  Go get it and have fun!!
B000QFCD2W|5.0|I have been a KD fan for over 20 years and this is his best record yet.  It mixes the King's classic sound with a modern progressive sound.  Production value is also his best.  A must for any avid fan or first time listener.

B000058THK|5.0|For some, Robert Schumann was the genuine personification of the XIX Century. If we analyze his entire life, surely we would be unable to find other composer more enrooted conscious or unconsciously with basic premises of this artistic movement.  No other composer in that Century could shape with major vigor such level of febrile poetry, bowing phlegm, imaginative restless, fiery melodic fantasy and unequaled introspection those well known facets of his intimacy like him.<br /><br />Since his stormy love affair and marriage with Clara Wieck, his terrible personal disgrace when he maimed his finger pursuing major virtuosity, until his progressive metal illness and final breakdown. But on the other hand, he anticipated by far the initial seed of the Symphonic poem, through his countless and dissected works of marked self biographical landmark or those lovable pieces dedicated to his daughter, moreover he influenced in straight line to Claude Debussy because somehow he depicted the first signals of a unthinkable musical Impressionism, but take a look around his Third Symphony for instance, Carnival for piano and his unforgettable and majestic lieder, as human being he remarked the grandness of his contemporary Chopin and torched the path for other late composers.<br /><br />There have been relatively few pianist really worried for diffusing his entire work for piano with such level of vehemence and rapture.<br /><br />And Demus, indeed, has been one of of them. His lavish musicality, articulated fingering and golden phrasing deserves him a very special place among the great ones at the moment to make a selected list among the most remarkable interpreters of Schumann's bequeath for the piano.
0618526412|1.0|This book is lacking some vital essence. Maybe that was the author's point. I don't go into a book with the expectation that I will bond with the characters, but I do need a reason to finish reading it. (In this case, the reason was pure, dogged cussedness on my part.) While MuCullers gives us page after page of rich detail about her characters' thoughts, lives, and surroundings, she never pulls back to let us see the big picture of why we should care. Just about anything by Steinbeck is better than this book.
0446677450|5.0|My fiance wanted this book because, he heard alot of good reviews about it. After receiving the book he considers it to be one of many that we will purchase by the author. We went to the website and it even showed us that his wife was involved and that grabbed our attention. This wonderful couple has a positive story and experience to share with the rest of the world and we are listening. So we enjoyed the book very much and we recommend others who are looking for this kind of advice to purchase the product as well.
B000O1799U|3.0|Yes, I know this particular review is a little \\"late\\" considering that the movie appeared in 2006, was nominated for Oscars, won an Oscar, won a Golden Globe, etc.  I have just now gotten up the nerve to watch it because I was afraid I would be disappointed.  Much to my surprise, I was not.  Don't get me wrong:  the movie does have its flaws.  I found that when there wasn't any music, the movie tended to drag.  But, thankfully, there's enough of music and the viewer can fill in the rest however he/she pleases!<br /><br />\\"Dreamgirls\\" is the movie adaptation of the Broadway hit that originally starred Jennifer Holiday in the role of Effie (played here TO THE MAX by Jennifer Hudson).  It was loosely based on the rise (and downfall) of the 1960s-70s meteoric hit group \\"The Supremes.\\"  Set in Detroit in the early 1960s, Beyonce Knowles is cast as Deena Jones (loosely derived from Diana Ross); Jennifer Hudson is cast as Effie White, and Anika Noni Rose plays (very effetively) the third Dreamgirl, Lorrell Robinson).  Jamie Foxx plays agent/manager Curtis Taylor, Jr. and Eddie Murphy plays Jamess \\"Thunder\\" Early.  Both Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy logged Oscar nominations; Hudson won for best supporting actress; Murphy lost in the best supporting actor category.<br /><br />Beyonce does a very good service to Deena Jones; Anika Rose is fabulous as Lorrell Robinson.  As stated above, however, it was Jennifer Hudson whose performance blew me out of the water.  Effie is the true talent of the three songstresses.  She can belt out a tune like nobody's business; however, Jamie Foxx decides in order for his group to become a mainstay, he must pander to the white audience and make his group sound \\"less black.\\"  Therefore, he switches lead singers in mid-stream:  Effie now plays second fiddle to Deena.  When everyone finally reaches their breaking point, Jennifer Hudson sings \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,\\" and, honey, if you are not moved by that song, you're dead.  I got up from my chair and screamed after it was over--that's how moving it is.<br /><br />I was disappointed in Jamie Foxx's playing of his character, Curtis Taylor, Jr.  He was supposed to be mean (he tried to be), but he just did not pull it off.  There was some controversy about Eddie Murphy not winning an Oscar for his portrayl of James \\"Thunder\\" Early, but after viewing this movie, I can understand why he didn't win.  If you are nominated for an Oscar in a supporting category, then you HAVE to do something memorable in your role.  I'm sorry but to me all he was doing was an overblown rendition of his James Brown schtick from Saturday Night Live.  It just wasn't enough.<br /><br />The movie is directed by Bill Condon, who I believe wrote the screenplay for \\"Chicago.\\"  He needs to stick to writing.  The movie's pacing and shooting were done haphazardly; little or no continuity.  The staging of some of the songs were downright boring.  In \\"And I'm Telling You\\" all you get is one light (looks like it's coming from a spaceship) and then Effie disappears.<br /><br />All in all, though, I still liked the movie.  Run time is 130 minutes and it is rated PG-13 for some language and references of drug use.  This movie really is a 3-1/2 star movie, but as you all have heard me complain ad nauseum, there are no half-star ratings!r and screamed after it was over--that's how moving it is.

B0007TKNL0|1.0|Yes it is visual stunning and Emmy Rossum is fantastic. The music is partially well, but its based too much on sound effects. There are the title melody and Christines song that are typical for Webber's genius, but the rest is kitsch, simply he overdid it with beeing commercial. I dont know if this is absolutely true to the original Webber musical, but I have seen an other Phantom Of The Opera movie where the storyline is much better drawn out.  Here in this movie of Schumacher, the story does not unfold, right in the beginning Christine already is becoming the star, and they say she had lessions from someone unknown - but it is right after her coming out as a great singer that she meets the phantom the first time. This makes no sense! In the other movie she first met with him during a long time period and learns with him, until he finally arranges that she can replace the operas diva. In Schumachers film there are several ridiculous moments, but the big one is at the end when Phantom binds Raoul to the gate, it is so laughable, it hurts. And the opera explodes as if its a dynamit depot. The movie reveals that Phantom really came as a little boy into the opera, escaping from a circus where he was shown and mistreated for his ugly face. This means he has really no right to be in the opera and he also has absolutely no artistic background, so how did he learn singing or to teach it? - by the way he can not really sing, if his singing voice is that from Gerard Butler, Butler really is no singer. I was disappointed to learn that Phantom has really no background to be at the opera. In the other movie it was left in the dark, but it seemed that he is there because of a long family relation with the opera or even was from an owners or directors family, in any case he came with a music background.
1590171993|5.0|I read this book because of previously having read the author's \\"Augustus\\" (also reviewed on Amazon).  \\"Augustus\\" is so impressive, that I expected an equally outstanding performance in this book.  If anything, this novel exceeded even my lofty expecatations.  The interesting thing is how different this novel is in form and substance from the author's historical novel on the first true Roman emperor.  \\"Augustus\\" is told through documents; \\"Stoner\\" develops through a straight narrative, with prose so lean, \\"plain\\" and effective it is truly remarkable. The focus here is not ancient Rome, but the University of Missouri in the first half of the 20th century. Augustus as an emperor is exceedingly successful; Stone at the end of his life is not sure it was worthwhile.  Yet, \\"Stoner\\" works at least as well as a novel as does \\"Augustus.\\"  On top of that, it has one important ingredient not found in the other novel--this book will touch you someplace along the line, believe me. Stoner, the central chracter, is somebody you will think about and judge throughout the novel, and even thereafter.  Was he a pathetic wimp, or did he have his priorities in line, or did he just take the course of least resistance at critical junctures in his life?  Superbly written, carefully constructed, authentic in detail (since the author had spent time at the U. of Mo. himself (Ph.D. 1954)), this is just an amazingly effective novel. It also raises some interesting questions about the role of University teaching and those who practice it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Once More with Feeling was the first \\"Buffy...\\" episode I had seen. My daughter forced me to watch it on her computer screen last fall (2006), as I sat uncomfortably on the edge of her bed, waiting to spring up in annoyance at any moment.   When the end credits rolled, I was still singing along. I fell in love with the characters immediately. What I had initially thought of as sophomoric nonsense had actually entertained me...impressed me.   It was not that I was opposed to ridiculous plots and fantastic tales, just that I had not connected to the whole idea of vampire humor. Spending more time with my 19-year-old daughter and her highly emotional girlfriends (who are usually stretched out all over my flat) has allowed me to relax and see the beauty in undead dramedy.   I bought this soundtrack, the whole series box set, and (eventually) the Angel box set as well. After 4 months of Buffy, Angel, Giles, Spike, Cordy, Willow, Anya, Gunn, and Xander each night, I am still in love with the Buffyverse and this soundtrack. It has taken on a life aside from the actual episode from which it sprang.   I recommend this CD to any Buffy fan, musical/rock opera fan, Joss W. fan, or fellow music fan.

B000059XUP|1.0|More of a remake than a sequel, \\"The Crow: City Of Angels\\" attempts to capitalize on the cult phenomenon of it's predecessor by basically repeating and rehashing it's basic premise without actually adding anything new or of merit. This time around, instead of Detroit, it's a decaying Los Angeles -- populated by set-pieces that look like they could be destroyed by a stiff breeze -- and Vincent Perez is summoned from the dead to avenge the death of his son and himself at the hands of a gang, with the help of Sarah (Mia Kirshner), who may or may not be the same Sarah from the first movie. Music video director Tim Pope, who hasn't done anything worthwhile since, gives this film a definite mid-90's look. Truth be told, not only does the movie look low-budget and meant for direct-to-video release, but also looks like something you would catch on HBO at three in the morning during a weekday. As hard as the script tries -- which, come to think of it, it doesn't -- it just can't match the potency of the original. Instead of getting to know our main characters and building the required backstory with the tragic elements needed, the exposition is handled in such a careless way. It seems like they wanted to get the story out of the way so they could get straight to the violence. A father avenging the murder of his own child? Should have had a little more emotional impact than what was actually presented in the movie. The actors all pretty much ham it up, although punk icon Iggy Pop manages to keep the audience from falling asleep, while his co-star, Thuy \\"Yellow Ranger\\" Trang, is at the very least, an interesting presence in a movie such as this. On all accounts, \\"The Crow: City Of Angels\\" is and was a complete and utter failure, dooming the rest of the franchise into direct-to-video Hell. Ironic, since the movies that came after it were actually, gulp, better.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|This remake of the 80s hit TV Show has the distinction of being written and directed by the creator of the original series.  And thankfully, it's nothing like the original.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas playing Crockett and Tubbs as they entering the seedy underworld of narcotics trafficking and trying to make the big bust to put the bad guys behind bars.  But if you look at it now, it doesn't hold up well with time.      In this version, creator/writer/director Michael Mann, who has proven time and again that he is an A list director, takes something that you know he's been itching to re-explore and does it with style and grace.  His list of films include The Last of The Mohicans, The Insider, Collateral, Ali and the near perfect DeNiro/Pachino drama, Heat.  A stellar list to be sure, but here he goes back to playing with an old toy, updating it to the next millennia.      Now the players are more serious, more realistic.  It's darker, it's grittier and it finds the frightening underbelly of Miami in so many scenes.  In this version Sonny and Rico (instead of Crockett and Tubbs) stumble on the breakdown of the identity of a snitch who's now working for the Feds.  Before they can help him he steps into traffic and kills himself.  From here, they work their way into the good graces of a drug runner who outsources his transportation.  Yes, even in the drug business, there is outsourcing.  The method of gaining trust is tense and the process is slow and arduous.  But the movie has a brisk pace and the action sequences are well done.    Collen Farrell (Sonny Crockett) and Jamie Foxx (Ricardo Tubbs) play their roles in solid form.  In an effort to distance their characters from the show, Mann has written them differently.  Rico is smart and level headed, much more like the senior of the two.  Crockett is slick and hotheaded at times but never over the edge.  They are surrounded by characters who support their deep cover operationsand they are obviously well trained and well informed.  If there are groups of vice cops like this, I feel a lot better.        With this recreation, Mann has shown what he would have liked to have done in the TV Series.  There were always discussions about the realism of the series and some might question it here as well.  But where the TV show was flashy and colorful, the movie is a glimpse of how shady and dangerous the life of a Vice cop can be and how close to the edge they get when dealing with the kind of people who run these businesses.
B00000IBVC|3.0|I am not an opera \\"buff\\" but I bought this DVD soley for the purpose of seeing someone I know in the opera..his name is Aldo Bottion and he played Altoum but, not knowing opera, I don't know which character this is..I hope it's not the old man with all that makeup, cause I couldn't even pick out my own mother with all that makeup...Could anyone tell me which one was Aldo Bottion?
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Buy this DVD! Rolando Villazon is one of the great tenors of the past 100 years, something that I feel is safe to say even though he has barely reached mid-career (the fates be willing). He is in rare voice throughout this performance and his performance and encore of Una furtiva lagrima are as fine as you will hear of this aria, even from Caruso or Gigli  -- the first time he sings it as a tenore leggiero and the second time as a spinto. You can pick and choose which version you like better, but you can have both. Netrebko is outstanding as Adina. While she has her critics, I find her voice and her acting to be irresistible in general, and this role is hardly \\"too big\\" for her voice. She gives the role plenty of character, too. The rest of the cast does the buffo business very well. This is a must have performance.
B000J103PC|5.0|All that buzz that surrounded Meryl Streep's Oscar-Nominated performance in `The Devil Wears Prada' was deserved, seriously.  But what gets me is the fact that she's really the only one who got the attention despite the fact that three other performances carry this movie just as well as she does, and one of them even outshines her quite a bit.  This is truly an extraordinary movie because it had all the potential to become nothing more than summer comedy tripe but instead, thanks to the wonderful script and brilliant comedic performances, it became one great movie.  From Streep's Cruella turn to Hathaway's wide-eyed innocence to Tucci's comedic timing to the magnificent scene stealing Blunt in what should have landed her an Oscar, everyone here contributes to the greatness that is `The Devil Wears Prada'.<br /><br />The film follows Andrea, a young journalist looking to make it big who finally gets a shot when she interviews for Miranda Priestly, editor of a New York fashion magazine.  She gets the job despite the fact that Miranda seems disinterested in her, but soon she finds that her new found profession may not be what she's been praying for.  Miranda is ruthless, able to be so successful because she has no heart, but this again is further proof that all that awards attention was justified.  Streep plays Priestly with so much conviction and emotion.  She's cold hearted and distant, but Streep gives her layers that we can find if we're willing to look.<br /><br />The question though is will Miranda destroy Andrea's good natured soul?<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is just darling in this film.  I'm really excited for where her career is headed.  I do feel bad for her in the fact that so far she's been in two films garnering other members of her cast awards attention while she just sits back and watches.  Maybe more so with `Brokeback Mountain' since everyone BUT her received an Oscar nomination, but even here when her performance was far more leading than Streep's yet Streep stole her thunder.  Alas, her performance is still memorable and I'm sure this young star is bound for some attention in the near future.  Stanley Tucci is also fantastic here as Priestly's right hand man.  He takes Andrea under his wing and shows her the ropes, helping her to make it in the cut throat world belonging the Miranda.  He's hilarious to watch, but still can't rise above the brilliance that is Emily Blunt.  Her performance here is comedic bliss.  She has the most memorable lines in the film, and her character is a piece of heaven.  Why she got passed up for the nomination for the 6-year old (8, 9 whatever) from the Sunshine movie is beyond me!<br /><br />So, the movie is great, literally.  I was actually shocked to like it as much as I did.  The plot may not really be anything new, and the moral lesson may be the same generic been-there-done that `learn to be a good person and not let the world change you just so you can succeed' type plot that most movies in this genre possess but it does it in such a fresh and exciting way that it's worth every single second.  So yes, Streep is brilliant and deserves the praise, but let's not forget the equally impressive performances that only added to her screen brilliance.er.

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's sequel to his wildly popular first novel, THE KITE RUNNER, is another luminous jewel of a book that will educate western readers to life in Afghanistan over the past several decades while appealing to them in many ways they will find intimately familiar.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS tells the stories of ordinary people in a land much like this one and at the same time, worlds apart, caught up in wars they did not initiate or ask for, simply because of their land's strategic importance to oiligarchies and conquerors past and present, whose greed has known no bounds.  For everyone who is interested in the human (and animal) cost of the suffering propagated on the invaded by the invaders, this is a must-read.

0385334206|3.0|If you enjoy bawdy, ludicrous theories, and can deal with the Vonnegut's roller-coaster mental track, this may be an interesting read.     Initially I found it to be too chaotic in organization, subjecting the reader to Vonnegut's tangential attention span. But one could argue, as most of Vonnegut's cult-like followers do, that this within itself offers an original style in American literature. After 100 pages I put the book down out of a lack of interest (and out of respect to the author since I didn't want to end his last book on my booklist on a sour note) only to pick it back up when the characters, as well as Vonnegut's style, beckoned my subconscious.     You either hate it or love it, there is no in-between and sometimes its a combination of both. Not recommended as in introduction to Vonnegut, but definitely a must for those inclined to visit his innovative universe.

1401207138|5.0|A comic book series (limited to only 12) that popularized the graphic novel format and was the first superhero comic to ever be considered serious literature. Primarily composed of adult situations, the murder mystery storyline deals with a world where superhero vigilantes were spawned by the Second World War, and were eventually retired out of fear after Vietnam.<br /><br />The style was original and unprecedented in comic books of its time and to date has been the only graphic novel to appear in Time Magazine's 2005 list of \\"100 Best English-Language Novels from 1923 to Present,\\" and also in the \\"Reader Top Rated ALL-TIME best novels.\\" Also, it has been admitted by the writing team of the critically acclaimed television series Lost, currently my favorite show of all time, as a significant influence for the series.<br /><br />For anyone who grew up reading comic books, it is simply a must read.

0684833395|4.0|This was one of those books that I constantly found in top 10 lists and beckoning to be picked up on many bookstore shelves. Also, I was intrigued how a book's title could gain such significance with its concept becoming such a common term.     The story is a tangled web of nonlinear narrative, unrelentingly logic looping, mental instability, military ineptitude, and satire. It took some time to completely embrace, but about half way through I found myself really gaining emotional attachment to the character ensemble and finally an admirer of the work as a whole. Now I can understand why this subversive work has lasted 40 years as a great American novel.
B000QUCNP4|1.0|The film is fantastic--I'd argue Fincher's best--but fans might want to wait for the deluxe edition DVD that is coming out after the new year featuring the director's cut of the film and hours of special features. This is the \\"no frills\\" version of the DVD. It contains the flick and nothing else. This is just studio double dipping.
0307346609|4.0|World War Z, by Max Brooks, describes what might happen if a virus got loose and caused a world-wide pandemic of re-animated people, i.e., zombies.   It is cleverly told through a series of interviews with various survivors around the world about their experience with or rather against the zombie hoards and how they managed to emerge from the plague uninfected.  A nice touch is how Brooks adds in \\"footnotes\\" which explain details of the subject's narrative - what a certain acronym means, what a piece of equipment did, etc.  Furthermore, Brooks effectively gives distinct voices to each of his \\"interviewees,\\" not an easy thing to do, especially given the number of subjects in the book.  World War Z manages, for its outlandish premise, to convey an impression of veritas through very readable, creative, yet plausible story-telling.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This really is a great band and a great CD.  Reminds me a little of both Coldplay and Radiohead.  The songs have depth.  You'll find yourself swaying to the beats as well as considering the lyrics.  Not to mention the lead singer has a beautiful falsetto voice at times, which is rare.  Especially in the song \\"Starlight\\", my favorite.  I also liked the astronomy-esque themes.  Hope you enjoy it!
B000QXDED6|5.0|This movie rocked.  The special effects were simply breathtaking!      The outlines of history are there, but watch carefully who narrates.  The tale is told by a Spartan leader before the climatic land battle against the Persians.  Of course it's embellished.  Of course its full of noble words about high ideals.  Yes there are larger than life enemies.  It's intended so.      Those with a low tolerance for gore should steer clear.  Similarly, those who can't help but to define their lives through the politics of the day should also avoid it.
B000002IZ4|5.0|We don't hear anything from the STP anymore.  It's our loss.  Overshadowed by the bitterly cerebral Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam Eddie Vedder's bombastic, sonorous voice--and being emotionally more akin to Radiohead--the STP spent several albums trying to claw their way out of the flannelled scene of the times, all the while being accused--often correctly--of mimicking other bands.      With Purple, they got it right.  The DeLeo brothers' incredible songwriting paired with Weiland's lyrics to form an accreted image of a self-punishing naif flailing--but not quite drowning--in the wicked world.  Life's aches and pains permeated all these tunes, the best of which--Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, Lounge Fly, Vaseline, the ridiculously named and shockingly good \\"Meatplow\\" --plead for understanding in the face of complete relational impasse.      Too, Weiland's voice was an unsung hero, as it were: a flexible, reedy tenor bouncing between raw and warm vibratto--far prettier than he was ever given credit for.  The DeLeos filled their songwriting with quirky, Byzantine chord progressions and hooks pounded out of guitars in a violent sludge that never, ever overwhelmed the searching tunes. And Eric Krentz' drumming drove these songs over a cliff into free-fall.  These men have done other work since (most notably 4's \\"Sour Girl, the best thing of their career) but Purple was the STP perfect storm--not one word or note rang false, and most of it was ravishing.  Years later, it still is.

B00000DCHD|5.0|Short and simple, this album is a member of the definitive 100 of the last 40 years of music. Billy Joel is one of the most lovable artists in the business because he has something for everyone. His songs are always played on the radio and always will be. Not many artists have been able to consistently please all of the people all of the time, but it seems that Billy has been able to do just that for the last 30 years, and 52nd Street is one of those most lovable of albums that he ever released. As the top reviewer said, 'flawed and lovable.' This is a great jazzy mix that you will ultimately find a treasure as I did. I consider it one of the man's very greatest and a complete essential.     The first three songs have always been synonamous with Billy Joel, displaying the songwriter in his classic element. How can we forget \\"Big Shot\\" since the radio won't let us? Agressive, and full of pop, it opens the album with a bang. This is the era when he was absolutely golden and jazzy, as the song reminds us. \\"Honesty\\" is quieter and much less rambuncous that the previous and you've probably heard it before even if you don't know it. \\"My Life\\" continues the winning tradition, a nice tune, and one of my favorites. Billy shows his rebellious side in style here, and every line is great. Wonderful harmony. The next four in a row are some of my very favorite Billy Joel songs. \\"Zanzibar\\" is a lost treasure, awesomely jazzy and trademark Billy. Just listening to it makes me want to go to Zanzibar on a Friday night in downtown New York. It sounds like a comfortable place to be. \\"Stilleto\\" follows, and the piano chords sound like a blade, slicing through this melody of harmony and again, jazz. Nobody could sing this one better than Billy. The next song might be my favorite Billy Joel song ever. \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" is the perfect combination of Latino influence and jazz, a song of pure sophistication. Makes me think I'm in Central Park under one of those 'Cuban skies' that Billy sings about. The zylaphones in particular make this song the coolest. Very relaxing. Finally, \\"Half a Mile Away\\" sounds like good times, making weekend plans and ready to roll. 'My other world is just a half a mile away', but thankfully this song is here now. One of Billy's greatest I'm sure you'll agree. Its a good time song. \\"Until the Night\\" is the only song on this album that doesn't pull much weight. I mean its not bad, its just slow and doesn't really fit here. I usually move on to the next one, title track \\"52nd Street\\". This is not the strongest point of the album, but it is a nice funky, jazzy ending. After so much gold, I'm not even sure the album could handle any more heat, it would probably explode! But I like it more every time I hear it.    There you have it. For the quality and price of this album, you can argue no fault. Its one of the most reasonable CDs you will ever come across that simply can't be passed up. Digitally remastered and full of fun, once you buy this album it won't leave your CD player for a while.    Enjoy it forever.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|I saw the movie recently but didn't like it. Sorry. There was too much pointless violence and the escapes from the authorities just weren't believable.    The biggest flaw, however was the setting. How could economies in such a world be in bad shape? If children just stopped being born for twenty years economic conditions would not deteriorate but would greatly improve, especially in the third world. Not only would the ratio of dependents-to-workers fall but the ratio of humans-to-resources would also fall. (I, personally, would not trade fatherhood for a higher standard of living. I think that few fathers would.)     Also, it doesn't makes sense that everybody would want to emigrate to England unless the infertility crisis hit the first world while sparing the third world.    I gave it a 3 instead of a 2 because Michael Caine as the aging boomer/hippie was great and because the teenage boy in me was entertained by all the car chases.

067101756X|2.0|wow.  A new history of the world based on Philip Corso.  Just happens to be at the right place at the right time to pry open a crate that contains the remains of an ET?  Claims that basically nothing was accomplished with the remnants of a recovered space craft held by the USAF until he was given the \\"nut file\\" some 10 years after the crash at Roswell.  Only then were scientists and industry leaders organized in a meaningful manner.  Wow.  Claims that the reason why the USA and USSR possessed 10 times the number of nuclear weapons to destroy the earth was to threaten aliens from thinking they could take over a portion of the planet.  And this was a mutually agreed upon decision by the countries.  Wow.  No discussion of the nuclear fallout that would basically contaminate the entire planet from such a massive detonation??  Claims that he was the real protagonist is pushing JFK to act forcefully against the Soviets in Cuba through a planned leak in the Boston Globe while JFK was in Massachusetts.  Wow.  Admits that ET's have the technology to travel 4000+ miles per hour in spacecrafts that can stop immediately, move to the front and back of all earthly crafts but somehow now we are on \\"equal footing\\" with them because we have military satelites that can destroy their space vehicles, just because Corso says so!!  Explain to me how a satelite can somehow outmanuever a craft that can do what Corso and military \\"experts\\" claim the UFO's can accomplish??  Wouldn't ALL satelites be super easy targets for such interplanetary space vehicles based on the capabilities that Corso himself describes????  Here is a man who had decided to risk reputation, pension, and life to make a \\"full disclosure\\" but didn't take the time to copy one single photo of an ET??  Not one single copy photo of a TOP TOP SECRET REPORT of a EBE or UFO with all the necessary markings of an official military document to corroborate EVEN a part of his incredible claims??? All the while claiming that he had unlimited access to such things for years!!! What did he have to lose by obtaining something, anything for the public to trust him.  Instead, he provides us with some sort of intelligence estimate about the possibility of creating a moon based facility.  What is so amazing about that considering the fact that we were putting men on the moon?????  I can go on and on.  Mr. Corso's ego is the real UFO in this story.

8590379825|5.0|Buying this book does more than support the Lua project.  Having the book available will change your opinion of integrating script with C code!  \\"Progamming in Lua\\" is a well-written text that makes using Lua practical.  All of the best features of Lua are covered; the sample code is concise, clear and complete.<br /><br />Lua is very different from C, and so allows a programmer to easily do things that are difficult in C.  That makes it a perfect companion language.  The only obstacle is training a C programmer to use it!  That's where the book becomes useful.  It's a quick read and covers all the essentials.<br /><br />Even better, Lua is so well-connected to C that it is easy to switch back and forth in the course of a typical programming day, writing performance code in C and high-level logic in Lua.  It is even possible to easily interact with Lua data structures in C without writing Lua code for situations where the data structures are desirable but Lua code isn't required.  If you're looking for a scripting language for your next project, you need to know about Lua, and this book is the quickest way to make an informed decision.
B000PFUA9G|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this album.  On the one hand, it has some of the most entertaining songs Paisley has ever put on an album.  I laugh out loud at the audacity of \\"Ticks,\\" \\"Mr. Policeman,\\" \\"I'm Still a Guy\\" -- the list could go on.  In my opinion, Paisley is truly clever in creating believable personas for his songs.  And the guitar -- I love it!!!<br /><br />My view is that this is a \\"concept\\" album, and the concept is best summed up in \\"I'm Still a Guy.\\"  Paisley and his team did a great job of picking songs that all fit together with a mixture of testoterone and adreneline.  In terms of the music, the only song I don't like at all is \\"Better Than This,\\" which I pegged right away as one Paisley hadn't had a hand in writing.  It sounds like every other country song out there right now, dropping famous names of the past and celebrating good ol' boy partying.  Every song he wrote or co-wrote, though, is solid.<br /><br />On the other hand, though, just about every song on this album has at least one line that I would rather my pre-teen children not hear (and certainly not run around singing, ha ha!).  For example, last night my 8-year-old daughter asked what \\"copped a feel\\" means.  OK, it gave me a good opportunity to have one of those \\"discussions\\" with her about something she'll run into someday anyway, but gosh, she's only 8!  And my son (age 12) loves \\"Mr. Policeman\\" -- we talk about how the song ends with \\"I'm in the Jailhouse now,\\" but guess what line he runs around singing??  \\"Go back to your Krispy Kreme.\\"  I don't know -- my kids love Brad Paisley's music -- I guess I would hope he will remember his status as a \\"role model\\" (whether he wants to be one or not!) a little more in the future.<br /><br />Back on the other hand, I still choke up a little every time I hear \\"Letter to Me.\\"  So . . . . I guess I would rate this album as one of those \\"guilty pleasures\\" of life.
1594489505|4.0|First off I should say that of all the authors I have read no one can breate life into the characters like Hosseini does. His narration of the feelings and emotions of the characters is so real that you really feel it. I loved this book and would definitely recommend it. I don't want to spoil the fun for others.    Now the weak spots.. (with one spoiler)  I have to agree with some other reviews that its mainly geared for western (read US) audience. And towards the end things start going very predictable.. and certain things (like Mariam's execution) look like it was added to suit the ending and also to put an emotional twist.    Though no one can deny the inhuman nature of taliban its probably US that did more damange to Afghanistan than taliban. I guess its pretty much a common knowledge now that US (indirectly) provoked Russians to enter into Afghan which cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Author seems to be conveniently ignorant of it and never has mentioned anything to that effect..
006112429X|4.0|Just finished this book. Whew...!It's written completely in the form of letters from a woman to her husband (who's obviously not living with her anymore). In them, she's retracing the past, trying to work out the how and why of the fact that their teenage son had gone off to school a year or two before and killed 7 classmates, 1 teacher, and a cafeteria worker.     It's not usually the kind of book I'd start on, but a colleague and friend really recommended it. I did not find it 'easy' reading. Aside from the subject matter, which I have something of an antipathy to, it's rather a long book for the letter style, and the sole voice adds to the oppresiveness of the subject matter. However - does this author ever have a way with words!! Her ability to describe thoughts and feelings in unusual and moving ways made it more than worthwhile. From the very first paragraph:    \\"Since we've been separated, I may most miss coming home to deliver the narrative curiosities of my day, the way a cat might lay mice at your feet: the small, humble offerings that couples proffer after foraging in separate backyards.\\"    It's a style, I think, that will either grab you right away or annoy the hell out of you. She (Eve) is absolutely not what you'd call a bad, nasty or evil woman - at worst, perhaps a bit self-absorbed. She's extremely intelligent, has a wry sense of humour, and is a succesful businesswoman who loves her husband very, very much. They were both ambivalent about having kids to start with, and she certainly wasn't prepared for a child like Kevin.     The Observor called it \\"An elegant psychological and philosophical investigation of 'culpability'\\" - and that's what it comes down to. Eve picking back through her memories and motivations - the story is constructed as she tries to pin down exactly the subconscious things that drove her own actions and reactions to her son in an effort to make sense of it all. In a way, the book is every bit as much about her as it is about her Kevin - perhaps even more so. Their interactions are the dance that defines the story. I found it exhausting at times, but I also can't count how often I stopped to re-read a paragraph for the sheer pleasure of the deft virtuousity of the author's wording. Almost everyone is aware, I think, of how intricate and sometimes contradictory the workings of their own mind and heart can be, but rarely have I come across a writer who can pin that down, in all its complexity, in mere words.     Something else I liked about it was the way it matter-of-factly (although not overtly) questions the universally acknowledged truth that a wedded woman with fertility and security must be in want of a child. I know that many do - God bless them - they're the soldiers who keep the human race going. But it's not for everyone. Parenthood is an awesome, exhausting responsibility. CNN has examples practically every day of 'parents' who shouldn't have been allowed to keep a dog. Many embark upon it, I imagine, out of pure ignorance or boredom, with precious little resources - mental, physical or financial - and with disastrous results. When I read about children who have been roasted to death in a car because their too-young single mother couldn't find a babysitter while she was at work, I don't quite know who or what I want - or should - rage and howl against.    But in this book, we're talking about financially secure, intelligent folks in their mid-30s who debated the pro's and con's, discussed what they were getting into, had an idea of what they'd have to give up, and thought they were ready to make whatever personal sacrifices necessary - and still it went terribly wrong. This is not the social mileau where people leave their infants or toddlers to boil to death in locked cars while they're doing something else, but it does seem to be the one that produces the children of Columbine.    In short, this book actually raises more more sophisticated questions about what being a 'good parent' is all about. It's also to its credit that it doesn't try to supply pat answers, although I did find oblique (and comforting for me) references to them in the very last pages. Definitely intriguing and rewarding to some, but not to all.
B000MZHW40|5.0|When you think about movies today, it's easy to get lost in the sequels, the remakes, the adaptations, and every other unoriginal and derivative source for brains-off entertainment Hollywood can muster. Part of this problem, sometimes, is the \\"true story\\", another easy way through a script (plotting, who needs to do THAT?) ... but, occasionally, there are stories that really, really have to be told. When that happens, an easy trap film makers fall into is to let the message carry away the movie, leaving the viewer awash in actor sermons and all other kinds of pretentious hooplah. Rarely does a movie come along that is important and yet also works as a movie. Blood Diamond is just such a rare gem.<br /><br />The characters are archetypes. Their names don't even matter ... They represent the three essential plot elements: a South African white diamond smuggler; an idealistic American journalist, female (played by the inimitable Jennifer Connally); and the African father desperate to save his son--and, by extension, the generation--from losing his soul to murder.<br /><br />Everything is well done in this movie. And if it's brutal to watch, well, it should be.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
1582701709|1.0|This was a waste of money.    All the teachings she explains have been written by other authors.   She never tells you how or how the others accomplish their goals.   People go and read Catherine Ponder's books and you will see it has been written before.   It is amazing how Rhonda must have read a lot of these older books, from different authors and packaged them with a catching name and sold it.  Before you all purchase books like this one and waste your money.  Check out the authors from days gone by.   They have a lot to offer.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|The blu ray version of this film is pristine! This is the director's cut version running nearly 3 in half hours. This feature explains the story and background much better than the theatrical version. The battles are some of the bloodiest and brutal seen on screen. Orlando Bloom holds his own as the lead. Not to mention some very fine supporting performances. All in all this is a showcase blu ray with grade A sound and picture quality. Highly reccomended!!!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|After the movie ended, me and my friend thought that this film could be 100 Hours long and we would watch it without getting bored.....I saw some reviews, people saying stupid things, dont believe them.....Find it and watch it.. absolutely beotiful and funny too!!!  great piece of art that surprised me a lot........Not so many movies like this anymore.......take care
B000M5AJQI|4.0|Not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but it still delivers. The story is pretty much the same with a few differences! The acting is grade A and the blu ray delivers spectacular sound and detail!!! Fans of the film will be pleased. Matt Damon gives and excellent performance. Martin won the Oscar for this film but it's nowhere close to being as good as some of his earlier work.
0374105235|5.0|I normally don't read nonfiction, but I could not help reading this riveting book. This book is written with such honesty and truth. This is the kind of book that should be on Oprah's Book Club.

B0000797IO|4.0|I really liked this movie.  But then, I always like offbeat, indie movies with a little heart.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston proves she's not just another pretty face in this brilliant little indie gem.  After a string of romantic comedies for exposure, she proved she had a soul under all that cute \\"Friend\\" persona with \\"The Object of My Affection\\".  This movie was under- appreciated and scorned by some in Hollywood -- maybe the boy-toy character with the Morrisey haircut was too much for them (the Paul Rudd love-interest).  Anyhow, in \\"The Good Girl\\" she shows all her acting muscles as she portrays, with sensitivity, how a small-town girl can get caught in a rut and somehow, despite looks and intelligence, never really get out of it.<br /><br />I grew up in a small, working class suburb of Baltimore and I know how some girls just get caught up in the life they have pre-ordained for them.  What didn't hold true for me was that Justine seemed too intelligent not to break out of this mold.  Most of the girls I know in this kind of environment would never have heard of Holden Caulfield.  If they had been forced to read \\"A Catcher in the Rye\\" they would not have understood it.  If they had understood it, they would not have stayed married to the John C. Reilly character.  This, to me, is the flaw of the movie.  Justine does not ring true.  She is too intelligent, too esoteric, for her predicament.<br /><br />But still, I admire Jennifer Aniston for making the movie.  She actually makes it believable.  She needs more movies like this.
0380715430|4.0|If you ever wondered why some things happen in the English language the way they do, or why do some apparently inexplicable differences arise between British English, American English and many other \\"Englishes\\", then this a book for you. Even though the author is no linguist, he certainly is an accomplished writer, and produced a very interesting book: fun to read and instructive at the same time. The writing style is so attractive, in fact, that it keeps you reading even when the subject itself is a bit too far-fetched or too technical. Overall, it is a valuable addition to the library of anyone interested in languages, their history and evolution.
0140449337|5.0|Meditations, in its own right, was never meant to be a book in the first place. That's why I can't mark it down for its fragmented passages and randomly recurring themes, which are sporadically placed throughout the book. Even with this issue, though, it's fascinating to remember the author and the conditions under which it was written. Marcus Aurelius, the last of the Five Good Emperors (about 180 A.D.), kept a personal diary while he was on a campaign at war towards the end of his reign. It's astonishing to recall that this philosophical work was originally solely a personal diary, in which he was reminding himself of his beliefs.    Meditations is still a fantastic book that offers deep insight into the nature of the human mind, and of nature itself. It questions and debunks some of the largest fears and desires which we let gain control of ourselves with great prose. His philosophical beliefs are well grounded on Stoic principles, and successfully illuminate themselves by the end of the book.    The only problem I had with the book was with its dismal view of human life. I can't complain, because it's part of his philosophy, but the book gets pretty dismal at times. But his advice really cheers one up at other points of his work as well.    I would recommend this book whether you're interested in the classics or not. Because it's timeless nature means that you don't have to be very familiar with Greek/Roman principles to understand it completely. If you need a book to lift you up, to enlighten you, or to deepen your knowledge of the nature of things, I would highly suggest this book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|God, I love David Attenborough.  Come on, you don't need a review to know this series is the bomb.  Buy it.  The Planet Earth Diaries - a 10 min. behind the scenes thingie after every episode - only increases its awesomeness.  Just go ahead and add this to your cart, and while you're at it, get some of Attenborough's own series, like Life of Mammals and Life in the Undergrowth.  While lacking the utterly immense scope of Planet Earth, they surpass it in both depth and the fact that you get all the irascible charm of Attenborough in-the-flesh, such as him fending off an angry bull elephant seal with a pole in Life of Mammals.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I generally don't review stuff a whole lot unless it really moves me. And I definitely don't spend a ton of time analyzing it to death and writing a tome on it. Simply put, this was the best album I ran across in 2006 and I've yet to find something that knocks it off my Ipod yet in 2007. I have never been a mega-fan of RHCP although I like a lot of their stuff. This one is expecially fun because my teenage kids are simply stunned that Dad likes something that they like!

B000QUCNP4|4.0|One of the most underrated directors of our time??  I think so...look at his catalog thus far--Alien 3, Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, The Game, etc....This film uses Fincher's usual darkness and earth tones in fantastic ways...the late 70's fit Finchers style perfectly...The film has a great pace--never very fast yet it never drags...You can see with the cast that a chance to work with Fincher attracts the best of today's young hollywood...Though we never get all the answers we want from this film as the crime has never been officially solved we come away satisfied regardless...See this film...one of the best of '06...
037571457X|4.0|'Persepolis' was my first graphic novel (or, in this case, graphic autobiography) experience. It is the childhood story of Marjane Satrapi, who was a young girl of liberal parents during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in the 1980s.<br /><br />Satrapi's drawings are simple yet poignant, and reading about her experiences and culture so foreign to me was at the same time both fascinating and dismaying. I hope to read more of her works.
1892005034|5.0|I find this book quite interesting. This book covers a technique of expressing the genuine feeling without accusing others. I felt inspired to communicate as I discovered that the apparent conflict between my need for authenticity & Non-violence has been resolved. I am grateful to Marshall Rosenberg for stimulating this new realiztion which is taking me to a more fulfilling plane in terms of both giving & receiving in my personal life.
B000OMF3K6|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I never liked to read until a friend read one paragraph in this book to me one day and I was hooked. I had to read this book. I read Watchers and I have been an avid reader ever since--that was 1984. The plot was exciting and I took it to bed with me for two nights and stayed up very late reading it until I had finished it. I great read, entertaining, fun, one of Koontz's early books and one of his better written books. I must read if you are a Koontz fan!
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I just got my copy today, and was so excited to listen to it, because I never tire of the Beatles, no matter how they repackage it.  So I popped into my computer to rip it to iTunes, like I do all my music, so I can put it on my iPod; my only actual CD player is in my car, and has been for several years now.    iTunes wouldn't recognize the CD at all, nor did my computer recognize it as being in the E: drive.  When I tried opening E:, it froze and wasn't responding, and I had to do a forced quit on the computer to get out.  This is not the first time I've had trouble with DRM on my laptop.  I couldn't even listen to it, let alone copy it!  That's what the 1 star is for--for Capitol, not the Beatles, whom I love as much as ever.    So if you have known issues with your computer dealing with DRM-infested CDs, you may want to walk away from this one.  I should've looked more carefully, because the traditional \\"Compact Disk\\" logo wasn't on it.  Fortunately, my Marketplace seller is willing to take it back and refund my money; I contacted her immediately.     The irony of DRM is that they're protecting their investment so well, they won't sell any of it, or at least they won't keep it sold.

0156027321|1.0|I read this book based on the wonderful reviews.  I really enjoyed the beginning, but I found it to be boring and unrealistic after the initial scenario of the ship sinking and Pi surviving on the lifeboat with the animals. It also grew to be disturbing, especially so at the end with the alternate explanation given for his survival.  At that point, I wished I hadn't even read it and spent my time doing something else. I also have no idea why the book promises \\"to make you believe in God\\", probably some editor's great marketing idea. I thought it to be too graphic and gory, not to mention unbelievable. This book is not for the sensitive or faint of heart.
1591841666|5.0|Like most good business books, the message The Dip shares is straightforward.  Yet it's very insightful and he does it rather concisely without trying to wrap a large book around it (as many other books do).  Note that the book's message is applicable to many facets of life, not just your job or career.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|The Weinstein Company seems to believe that \\"tampering\\" with a great film is the best idea to make more money. They've lost my business already. I loved Grindhouse. For the people who did see it, Loved it! It was the funnest movie of the year and certainly will appear on my top ten list of 2007's best films.   The problem with this edition of Death Proof is #1, this is an extended cut and #2 its half of the two films that made Grindhouse (fake trailers may not be included?). Don't get me wrong, I'm curious to see what Tarantino did ,but I want to buy the movie I saw in the theaters...and I've told many people about Grindhouse and they are excited to see it. Too bad they won't.   Its really sad to see the fait of Grindhouse. For those who didnt see it in the theaters...you'll never know how great it was. That is of course if The Weinstein Company gets a grip. The theatrical cut needs to see the light of day on DVD!
0743455967|5.0|I am not a fan of Stephen King. In fact, he scares me. This is the only book of his that I've read; it made me want to read his others. I have quoted his thoughts and advice on writing more than any other book I've read on the craft.    The book is divided into four sections.    C.V. is the autobiographical section (about 100 pages). Short blurbs of memory combine to explain why Mr. King is the way he is and why he writes what he does. It was disturbing, bazaar and sometimes funny. I actually didn't read the whole section. It was too weird for me. Fans of his books may very much like knowing more about his life. Personally, I'm not that interested.    The Toolbox section (only 30 pages) is a condensed class on writing basics. He briefly, but powerfully touches on the importance of vocabulary, grammar and usage, style, etc. These are items in every writer's toolbox. If rusty or missing, your work will suffer. Good writers need the right tools.    On Writing (120 pages) is the best collection of advice (that I have found) for new writers. Mr. King is at times crude, but always honest. He expects much; his standards are contagious. He offers quantitative and wise advice. Sandwiched between those helps are philosophies that spur introspection. This, along with the Toolbox, are essential readings for every writer.    The last section, On Living (about 20 pages), is an interesting bookend. It is a window into the current mindset of this writer. After reading the rest of the book, this brings the reader full circle, seeing the crazy childhood, the trials and successes in the middle and finally a solid, contented man at the end. I don't know ... it just makes sense. And it makes me want to read more of his books.    Final Thoughts: If you're a fan of Stephen King, read the first and last parts. If you're a writer, skip the first 100 pages and read the rest. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0307276902|2.0|What has happened to our reading public when it is claimed with gusto that James Frey is a good writer?    Henry James is a good writer.  Thomas Hardy is a good writer.  Harper Lee is a hauntingly good writer.    James Frey is a cop-out.  It is exceedingly difficult to write well, especially when the subject is as colossally emotional as Frey's.  So Frey resorts to tricks and distractions so that he doesn't have to write well.  He repeats himself, repeats himself, repeats himself.  He dispenses with convention - no quotation marks, for instance.  He strings together phrases and fragments into garbled sentences.  He describes intense emotions simply with a string of expletives.  He writes like a teenage boy might talk.  Perhaps this lends a certain authenticity to the voice, but in my mind, it is a cop-out.  I would not be surprised if we all got to read the first draft - no reason to edit something that is garbled on purpose.    I'll admit that the story is at times compelling, and certain scenes, particularly with Lilly, are poignant.  These things kept me reading the book, but it was in spite of the writing, not because of it.    I do not particularly care that the details were embellished.  I have a fairly refined BS meter, and would have ignored over the top stories anyway.  I do find it ironic, however, that Frey himself talked about his own BS meter when conversing with certain characters whose stories were unbelievable.    How did this sell so many copies?  Sometimes it seems like art is a fashion business.
0316166685|5.0|Having had this book on my shelf for years, I was recently assigned to read it for my high school's summer reading.<br /><br />Susie Salmon died on December 6, 1973 at age fourteen.  From heaven, she recounts her murder as well as the events that preceded and follow her death.  The young girl watches as those around her live on while she is dead - schoolmates trading rumours of her death, family trying to recover, new bonds forming.<br /><br />Alice Sebold tells the compassionate tale of a young girl coming to terms with her death.  From resentful to accepting, Susie Salmon grows even after her body is gone.  And in the end, she comes to realise: \\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections - sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent - that happened after I was gone.  And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it.  The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future.  The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life\\".

B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace, takes us to the beginning of this tremendous saga.  Clearly this movie is very polarizing.  There seems to be a lack of any middle ground, which is a bit ludicrous, I think.  This movie had numerous memorable characters and a few rather forgettable ones.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi<br />Natalie Portman as Padme<br />Scenes with Darth Maul<br />A young Yoda... well, younger anyway.<br />The visual aspects of the film are generally excellent.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Jar Jar<br />Some of the scenes felt a tad bloated.<br />I would have liked a bit more action.<br /><br />All in all this was a very good movie that did not live up to the hype.  However, there was no way this movie was going to live up to its hype.  I enjoyed the film for what it is and was, a fun flick that introduced new characters to a wonderful genre of its own... Star Wars.
B000H5V8DG|4.0|I had been waiting for a box set of this show. I caught it a few times during its original run and knew it would be a show I would love. I didn't want to buy the individual seasons so when this came along I was psyched! The only major gripe I have is the lack of episode summaries. The book included in this set is really kind of pointless. It would have been useful to have an episode guide, like the BUFFY box set has. There are times when days or weeks will pass and then I will forget what episode I left off with. An episode guide would help a lot! Other than that, love this set and love this show!!!
B00023B1LC|5.0|In my excitement to see the newly released Bourne Ultimatum, I decided to again watch the Bourne Identity, released in 2002.  The Bourne Identity features the story by Robert Ludlum with Matt Damon as the amnesia addled Jason Bourne.  Directed by Doug Liman ([[ASIN:B000AP04FG Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)]]), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense.  Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne.  Having read the book years ago, I was interested in how well Damon would do as Bourne.  He did not disappoint.  Having watched the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy, I can not imagine another actor better suited for the role.  Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris.  Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support.  This is a thrilling movie that is incredibly well-done.  Matt Damon as an \\"average guy\\" thrown into mysterious circumstances really excels here.<br /><br />The movie features stunning shots from a variety of excellent locales throughout Europe.  A group of assassins are activated to kill Bourne, and the fun begins.  This movie offers two hours of fun filled thrills and suspense.  I highly recommend this 5 star movie.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Sean Connery's James Bond films were, for the most part, classics.<br /><br />  But Daniel Craig's portrayal is in a class all its own. Craig's Bond is edgier, reflecting a James Bond who is amoral, aloof, far removed from the values of the average person - which makes him well-suited for killing.<br /><br />  Gone for the most part is the techno-wizardy of Q that provided so much of the fun of the Connery films. There's a bit of it: a Sony-Ericcson cell phone plays a small part as does a 1964 Aston-Martin with a surprising array of goodies in the glove compartment.<br /><br />  Instead we have a relentless Bond who pursues his quarry without mercy. Bond's ruthlessness and coldness is demonstrated in the opening sequence. His subsequent exchanges with M, flawlessly performed by Judi Dench, hammer home that this Bond is still rough around the edges and his masters appreciate that: they want an automaton who doesn't worry about collateral damage.<br /><br />  The requisite willing women fall for this Bond's charm as they have fallen for every Bond.<br /><br />  The story is actually a bit of of a muddle, but there's so much action, no one cares.<br /><br />  The villains, particulaly Le Chiffre, are as good as Daniel Craig.<br /><br />  This is an old-fashioned film in many ways and all the more satisfying for that. No greys here, no nagging questions about morality. There is good - and his name is James Bond. And there is bad - everyone else. This new, edgier Bond is a tribute to all the classic adventures, thrillers and action movies of the past. It hold your attention from start to finish.<br /><br />  In short, it's great.<br /><br />Jerry

B000EQ47HC|4.0|THE BAND: Tom Scholz (guitars, piano), Brad Delp (vocals, guitar), Barry Goudreau (guitar), Fran Sheehan (bass), Sib Hashian (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1978) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 33 minutes. Remastered* edition released in 2006. Included with the disc* is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, 4-page intro from writer David Wild, numerous band photos, and thank you's. All songs written by Tom Scholz, except \\"Party\\" (by Scholz and Delp) and \\"Used To Bad News\\" (by Delp). Label - Sony/Legacy/Epic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: After Boston's amazing '76 debut, their next album was bound to be a let down (after all, their 1st album is still the all-time selling debut, ever). But can you really compare them? I prefer not to. I don't compare Led Zeppelin's first album to their 2nd, Van Halen's 1st to their 2nd, or Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" to \\"In Utero\\". I accept these 2nd releases for what they are... sometimes a continuation, other times a complete departure. Though \\"Don't Look Back\\" took 2 years in the making, I think of it as a continuation. Similar songs - similar sounds - trademark guitars and Delp's soaring vocals. It's a good rock album. Though honestly, if I'm in the mood for some Boston, 4 out of 5 times I still pull out their debut. As the numbers go, \\"Don't Look Back\\" reached #1 on the Billboard pop charts in 1978 and had 3 hits - \\"Don't Look Back\\" (#4), \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" (#31), and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" (#46). With 4 million albums sold in the 1st month of it's release, the listening public was clearly hoping for another powerhouse album. For me, the best songs were always the title track, \\"Party\\" and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\". The power ballad \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" may have been geared toward the ladies - but to my ears, it was simply too soft with depressing lyrics. \\"Don't Look Back\\" also had 2 very obscure tracks - the last 2 songs on the album, \\"Used To Bad News\\" and \\"Don't Be Afraid\\". Both decent rock songs, but the melodies ultimately forgettable... thus ending the album on a down note. While this album can't match the power of their enduring debut, it's easily the band's 2nd best effort. Label and contract issues came into play on every album after (Boston's 3rd album, \\"Third Stage\\" was released an amazing 8 year after \\"Don't Look Back\\" to mixed/poor reviews). \\"Don't Look Back\\" as a whole is very short. Some will say that you shouldn't mess with a classic. I say the label missed a nice opportunity to fill some space with some unreleased songs or live material from the era. Remastered sound is crisp to a flaw as Scholz himself looked after the project (4 stars).table... thus ending the album on a down note.

B00003CXTG|1.0|What a awful disgrace of history on film. To take one of the most tragic days in American history and distill it down to a tepid romance is shameful. Just because a film is 3hrs. plus doesn't make it a epic and the miscalculation to spend the first third of the movie away from Hawaii is just bad storytelling. Why not begin with the men on the ships and get to know some real characters that we actually care about instead of some cheesy 3way love triangle, that way when the terrible attack occurs we feel real sympathy for the men instead of blasting us with mind numbing sound and effects. This could have been a great film about a important day if Spielberg or Cameron had done it. The finished film here will be remembered only as a national embarrassment.
0345444051|4.0|An alien race comes to Earth, and wants to uplift and change the humans, and basically make them posthuman, evolve them further, and repair what has happened to the planet.    However, some people are not sure whether this is a scam or not, and alien slavery is not that appealing, and they resist.    In the unsettling school of book.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|A great \\"horror\\" serial kind of like \\"The X-Files\\" crossed with \\"The Hardy Boys\\". Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are excellent as the evil-hunting brothers. The show can be a little scary for younger viewers, but for those who loved \\"X-Files\\" this is a very worthy successor. Most of the episodes are stand-alone, but there is a common storyline that also threads throughout the season. Fortunately this storyline is nowhere near as incomprehensible and annoying as the alien invasion/rebellion snuff that bogged down \\"The X-Files\\" in later seasons. \\"Supernatural\\" is a scary, exciting good time.
1594489505|5.0|To express in a few words the effect this book had on me is virtually impossible; I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />If there ever was a time I felt thankful for my life and the blessings it holds, it was while reading about the tremendous struggles and pain that the women in this book endure. Their strength and persistence are proof of what people can achieve. I also learned a lesson in Afghan politics and society.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Loosely based (which means ripped off from) on[[ASIN:B00005KA70 Ultraviolet]], which is a truly wonderful BBC take on vampires but owing more to [[ASIN:B000228EK4 The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]] than [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]], and done by the same people who gave us [[ASIN:B00005JLWN Equilibrium]], it coulda/shoulda been...well, FUN at least.

B00000I41J|5.0|Although Cannonball is the leader on this date, this LP was recorded at the time he was playing with Miles Davis who agreed to join him as a sideman.<br />But in this stage of his career, Miles played second fiddle (horn) to no one!<br />His beautiful and restrained statements are as beautiful as anything else recorded in the history of jazz so Cannonball, great as he is, sounds too verbose in his bop-based flights of fancy.<br />Rhythm section is impeccable (hank jones-p, sam jones -b, art blakey-dm) so this became one of the loveliest albums of the era.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Whether you like \\"westerns\\" or not, this is, by far, the most fascinating western ever made and I do believe Sergio Leone's best film direction! I had no idea what this film was about when I saw it at a drive-in theatre when it was first released circa 1970. However, I do recall exclaiming, \\"What a movie!\\" The storyline is captivating, the performers are at their absolute best, the cinematography is incomparable, the setting is perfect and the music is incredibly good. Simply put, it's all a perfect blend and a movie you'll never forget.
0375847227|5.0|This is a great book.  It was amazing to have all three books in one, so you can just keep going. Read it before the movie comes out!!
B000P0I4O4|4.0|The movie was pretty good.<br /><br />The journey through the Pacific Northwest forests, and the shoot outs, climbings that went down sheer rock faces, and the navigation of treacherous bridges and a stand off in a log cabin were awesome-very action oriented. Beresford (the director) kept the movie a real thriller like he did in his other movies,  \\"The Fugitive and Double Jeopardy.\\"<br />Freeman had uncharacteristic moments of brutality which created an interesting contrast in his character. I really like him as an actor.<br />It had great atmospheric visuals though, don't you think.  Impressive effects with a helicopter, struggling with the shear face of a cliff in torrential rain and the cross-the-rickety-bridge sequence were my favorites. I give it a 4/5.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this film! In my opinion, HALLOWEEN is without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made! I love everything about it! I love that it takes place on HALLOWEEN! I love all the characters; especially Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. I love the mood and atmosphere! It has a classic horror story of a psychopath breaking out of Smith's Grove Sanitarium the night before HALLOWEEN and the next day, returns to Haddonfield, Illinois and goes on a rampage and stalks three friends named Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from killing anyone, but it's already too late. Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, and next door, Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace. Michael waits patiently to make his move. I love Michael's mask! It's freakin' awesome! Will Laurie survive the dark, bloody HALLOWEEN night? If you love classic horror, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN!!!!<br /><br />Update 12/31/12;<br />I got this movie on Blu-Ray as a Christmas gift this year, and it was even more awesome. I've watched it three times so far!
031286504X|4.0|I Am Legend was a great story and a quick read and one of the best endings I've read in any novel. Just a great line and a well painted picture of the scene and the emotion. The rest of the short stories are very hit and miss. All of them paint a picture and put you in the story and really give it life, but the endings seemed flat or confusing. I understand that you're supposed to be left with questions and you should form your own thoughts, but I would prefer some idea about what's going on. That being said, if you buy this book for I Am Legend, you will not be disappointed and you'll find one or two other stories that make the book worthwhile outside of the title story.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|The movie is a corny passionately made production meant to be silly in tone - loving homage to the 1930s serial features and the original comic strips in all their cheesy glory.  The special effects were purposefully made to look simple, and the acting as well as the production value were purposefully over the top.  This is a glittering New Wave daydream - space as seen through the lens of Studio 54.  It's a whole mess of fun.<br /><br />This Universal DVD has the BEST transfer available of the film and that is the reason to get this instead of the PAL European version. The Silver Anniversary Edition isn't nearly as clear as this one's - that one looks slightly washed out in skin tones and the colors are too hot.  The colors are incredible here in the States, and Universal did a great job with the look of the film allowing you to see details you may have never seen.  It is the best copy available to date.<br /><br />As far as the extras go...<br />True the Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson commentary was nixed because the two actors would not be paid for their participation.  And the two commentaries from the European edition (Director Mike Hodges and actor Brian Blessed) are owned by another company, so of course they aren't on this one.<br /><br />We do get an interview with the guy who redid the cover art who is a fan of the film, and a discussion with the script writer who remembers how wild it was working with the International crew.  Also included is the first episode of the Buster Crabbe serial version.  This will let you see what they were shooting for in the film.<br /><br />All in all you have to ask - what's more important the transfer and how the movie looks or the extras?  That will determine which one you'd be happy with.
0618871713|5.0|About: Graphic novel about the author's relationship with her father.    Pros: I don't usually read graphic novels but read about this one in a \\"Best Graphic Novels\\" article in Booklist (at least I think it was Booklist) and thought it sounded interesting so I checked it out.  It did not disappoint. Interesting story, wonderful art.    Cons: This isn't really a con, but since graphic novels might be associated with the kid crowd, this one tends toward an older audience    Grade: A
B000PAU032|2.0|I am a big fan of Zimmer in general, he has done some of my favourite scores. however i don't think this double CD is really worth buying unless you are new to Zimmer and want a brief overview of some of his work. There's seems a couple of odd choices on here when there is so much classic stuff to choose from, and i would thoroughly recommend getting the scores seperately to any film you may have seen which caught your ear.I don't think the arrangments here particularly add anything to the experience either, and if like me yuo enjoy the scores partyl as a memory of the film, i think you're better off with the original tracks and arrangments.  Shame, could have been better.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I borrowed this from my local library to check it out (if you'll pardon the pun). I enjoyed the more upbeat tracks such as Dirrty, Fighter and the one about first love (I forget the title). Christina has a magnificent voice, but she would have much greater impact if there was some variation in it - it isn't necessary to be so loud and vulgar all the time.<br /><br />The more mellow songs, with the exception of Beautiful, all sounded the same to me. A couple of them were pretty good, but in the end were killed by the fact that they seemed to go on forever. This is one of those CDs that I get or borrow to rip the tracks off of it that I like (maybe half of the disc, if that), and then return it or sell it.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|\\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" (2006) is directed by Tom Tykwer (Lola rennt (1998), Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000), and Heaven (2002)) and based on the bestselling novel by Patrick Susskind which is one of the most amazing debuts in the world literature. The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...<br /><br />\\"Perfume\\" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smile, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.<br /><br />I believe that Tom Tykwer made an astounding film that is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.ifying and fascinating goal.

061891868X|5.0|I am not a physicist, but I am a scientist who has been trying to teach myself particle physics the past couple of years. While there is something kind of intuitively pleasing about `string theory' it bothered me that as such it fails to meet the basic test of a theory in science; that it can be stated in such a way as to at least propose a test, even if the test is nearly impossible, and that it make at least some sort of meaningful prediction about the real world. This normally comes in the form of `If A and B then C.' It does not have to be that simple; some theories are inordinately complicated.    `String theory' is, in fact, a very complex mathematical approach to merge the very weak force of gravity into the standard model of physics. Richard Feynman was one of the authors of the standard model. He attended an early conference on string theory and told his wife that he was in the company of a `host of dolts.' He repeated the oft quoted George Gamow that \\"mathematics bares the same relationship to science that masturbation does to sex.\\"    What Lee Smolin does in this book is to show why `string theory' has failed to met the basic test of science, but has become the standard of theoretical physics departments for reasons other than the scientific merits. This book and Smolin's earlier work, \\"Three Roads to Quantum Gravity\\" are excellent primers on the topic.    In the end the strongest reason to continue to take 'string theory' seriously is that Ed Witten at Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies continues to have faith in it.
0030839939|5.0|The Ashcroft text is superior to other Solid State texts because of its readbility. It is not over-written like some texts, and its presentation of fundamentals is appropriate for a graduate course in solid state physics. It is not fair to under-rate the book simply because it is \\"old\\". Despite having several decades to write a better book, few authors have.    There are advanced chapters toward the end of the book that lay the foundations for superconductivity and vibrations in solids, among other things. Like most physics books, the direct application of the physics to real world tools is an afterthought, as it took me 5 years of experience to finally realize that Ashcroft's treatment of phonons in later chapters could be used to describe the piezoelectric efficiency of acoustic sensors. Perhaps this is because the book is dated, or perhaps it is because many physics texts fail to make the link between consumer technologies and fundamental breakthroughs in understanding, as if it is beneath the moral integrity of physics to worry about the engineering that follows. The work in superconductivity is advanced for a typical solid state course and might be better for a special topics series, as it was when I was a graduate student.     Ashcroft will serve as a good primer for most solid state topics, and it is well augmented with Kittel. A lesser book by Ibach and Luth, while it has just a few positive qualities, will fail a student unless they have Ashcroft on hand. Between Ashcroft and Kittel, a student would have a strong reference library.     As a side note, while it seems to be par for the course for most solid state texts, little is done to address the findamentals of crystalline structure that have led to the growth and evolution of the field of materials science. One of Ashcroft's introductory chapters summarizes a fundamental MSE text (such as Callister) very well by describing different crystalline structures and calculating packing fractions. However, it requires a leap of understanding to see that solid state physics is not just about semiconductors, but it is also about strength of materials and the fundamentals of transmission electron microscopy, among other things. Ashcroft is not to blame for this oversight - perhaps publishers would rather separate these topics for diversification and an overall increase in sales.       In short, if you are an instructor considering a text for you upcoming course, I strongly recommend Ashcroft. The physics hasn't changed since the book was introduced, though the applications have.

I might prefer 4 hour workweek that is little more concrete with suggestions to get out of ratrace than sheer advice as to \\"please quit and do something else\\" in a polished way.    The 2 star is for the concise and well written document..Not for the content!

I told my boyfriend what type I am and I think once he knows what he is supposed to do, it makes me feel that he loves me more and our relationship got better and better. It took a few months for him to propose to me but it was a very short engagement. Now we've been happily married for over a year and everything is so great. I think some of the things once you know and practice for a while, it becomes second nature and you won't have to think about it anymore. Good book to read at least to get to know yourself.

B000RJO578|5.0|Two things need to be understood before you watch this movie:<br /><br />First, that it's tongue in cheek! Although it's an homage to cop movies, it does so by making fun of them! But not in the way American comedies make fun genres. This is not Epic Movie or the Airplane movies. It's much more subtle than that!<br /><br />And that it's British. Some Americans just don't get British humor! I don't know why but they just don't find British humor funny. If you don't get British movies or TV, you aren't going to get this either!<br /><br />If are cool with both of those things, then you are going to love this movie! I did! I was rolling with laughter. First off, Nick and Simon have such great chemistry, such comic timing, and are so fun to watch that they could hold the movie all on their own! But add in all the extra characters including Timothy Dalton, who is so damn funny and over the top! Then there's the clever dialog. The wit in this movie is razor sharp! Finish it off with great direction, strong production values, and excellent editing and you've got a movie that is a riot to watch<br /><br />What I think trips people up about this movie and Shaun of the Dead is that they can't categorize it. It's a comedy, but it's a farce about cop movies, totally makes fun of the gore in some cop movies (Bad Boys II) by going over the top with the violence (ie church spire), and all around entertaining romp! It is not for the weak of heart nor is it for the casual comedy fan. This is a movie made for movie fans!<br /><br />Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest, grossest, exciting, and entertaining movies I've seen in years! Keep it up Nick and Simon!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is by far the most breathtaking, yet hauntingly romantic production ever made of Jane Eyre.  Compared to the other Jane Eyre films, this one seemed to focus much more on the romance and apparently the rather \\"psychic\\" relationship between Jane and \\"her\\" Edward.  Based upon my perspective it actually portrayed how truly connected the two were.  It also must be said that Toby Stephens is one of Britain's finest actors, and he certainly does it for me...hands-down as one of my favorite leading men, not to mention the \\"most\\" rakish Mr. Rochester ever!  The chemistry between Edward and \\"his\\" Jane was just so profoundly believable...I Loved it!  Do keep an eye out for Ruth Wilson who portrayed Jane Eyre, she is going to be one of Britain's newest leading ladies in film.  Although portrayed rather mouse-ishly in the film, she is a beauty with the strength, yet refreshing grace of a woman.  She knows how to act.  If you are in search for a romantic film, this is definitely a \\"must see\\" in the category of period piece romances!

0451450523|5.0|Peter S. Beagle serves up a wonderful tale of loss, true but unrequited love, faith and sacrifice.  I'm not going to outline the story because others have done that quite well.  To me, this is more than just a simple story about a unicorn's quest to find others like herself.  It addresses the loneliness of anyone who is 'different' or 'unusual'.  It shows that there is a magic place in each of us where something pure and delightful dwells, and that sometimes it takes a great sacrifice and leap of faith to find that place. It tells a tale of unusual heros, and that heros are not always those who slay dragons, rescue fair maidens or defeat the Black Knight.  Well, alright, rescuing fair maidens is good too, but sometimes, loss is the very thing that is needed to learn what true love really is.  And if, at the end, the magician becomes whole, the prince finds a princess, the unicorn rescues all of her kind, and the reader discovers thier own unicorn; well, there's nothing wrong with that either.
B00068NVI4|1.0|As several reviewers have astutely noted, the sound is emasculated, the performances tame and Jon Anderson is so much up front and more annoying than usual.  I agree with his sentiments, but his smug goody-two-shoes guru of PEACE! LOVE! HAPPINESS! demeanor is purely peurile.  It's excusable when not excessive and the band is crankin' -- but here it seems Messrs. Wakeman, Howe, Squire & White are mainly window dressing for the highly enlightened, inspiring, mercurial Jon Anderson.  I've seen Yes at least a half dozen times from '75 on.  This represents the band at a nadir; perhaps they're just too old and creaky to blast off like they used to.
031286504X|5.0|I bought this book because I had seen that a movie version is coming to theaters.  I also know that the movie versions of books can leave a lot to be desired.  After reading this, I really hope the movie captures what the story holds.  The actual story of \\"I am legend\\" is under two-hundred pages, and the remainder of the book is comprised of short stories.  I couldn't actually put the book down for \\"I am legend\\" and ended up reading it in two nights before going to bed.  I would recommend this book 100%.
B00008FEWK|5.0|Whoa, what can I say about this one that hasn't been repeated a million times over? This is not my favorite Wonder album - I'm still gonna have to give that honor to either Talking Book or Innervistions, depending on my mood. There's only one song I really don't enjoy, and that's Have a Talk with God. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to the spiritual element of the lyrics at all. Stevie sounds like he means what he says, and that's all that really matters, right? I just don't like the song's synthesizer part: without it, it would've been far better. And a couple of other songs do have rather annoying bits, like the second half of Ordinary Pain (the first great) and the second half of Black Man: while it starts off as a strong tune about the power of integration, it ends up a student/teacher questioning session. Interesting conceptually, but so is Revolution 9: if you're gonna do something like that, it should be made a minutelong interlude during the real song, not four minutes of repeating the points Stevie made.<br />Those complaints aside, this is a marvelous album. Stevie's songwriting skills really win out here: Knocks Me off My Feet is one of my numerous favorites here, a triumph of melody and insightful, wise love song lyrics that reflect the confusing nature of being in love perfectly. Oh, and I like the chorus, and the... post-chorus, would you say? You know, the \\"I don't wanna booooooore you wiiith it, oh but I love you I love you I love you...\\". The more I listen to it, the more I realize it's probably my favorite song on the whole album. It wasn't a big hit, but do give it a listen. Or several.<br />Now for the songs that were big hits: I Wish is one of Stevie's best funk songs - booty-shakin' groove, a horn duel to rival Superstition's, and a touch of humor. Sir Duke is interesting in that it works in big-band jazz elements to funk, something you don't usually hear from the genre. Talk about a seamless, if offbeat, blend of styles! And Pastime Paradise definitely wins when it comes to the \\"cool\\" factor. The Eastern instruments, meditative, philosophical lyrics, and full choir give it an epic feel. It's one of the several highlights. No, I'm still not done naming highlights. The fourth smash hit was Isn't She Lovely, an unbeatable explosion of pure joy. Plus I love the baby \\"talking\\" in the interlude: not only is it bold experimentation, it's also (more importantly) some of the most heart-warming music I've ever heard. Few can communicate utter happiness like Stevie Wonder.<br />But wait - there's more! Much, much more. Another Star is another longtime favorite of mine: over the course of eight-and-a-half minutes it goes from R&B to an almost tribal chant to jazz. Cool! Great chant, too. I've also always loved As. I've gotta say that it's a very underrated song, a declaration of pure love with Stevie doing the \\"big-man\\" vocals he popularized on Livin' For the City. And the coda, while repetitive, is hypnotic: its length, scope, and quality almost make it the soul version of Hey Jude, only I prefer it to Hey Jude. And the Beatles are my favorite band, so that's really saying something. Joy Inside My Tears also has a repetitive coda that sounds fantastic. Joy is one of Stevie's sad, pensive ballads. And it's great. If It's Magic is one of the album's many unsung gems, if only for the subtle, lovely orchestration and Stevie's harmonica solo near the end; I Am Singing has a wonderful melody; and Summer Soft is an inspired fusion of soul and soft-rock, two very opposite genres.<br />And I haven't gotten into that bonus EP. That is some good stuff right there, man. Ebony Eyes is an awesomely fun love song, with a cool sax solo and an even cooler sax solo introduction: \\"SAXOPHONE RIGHT HERE!\\". All Day Sucker is FUNKY, Saturn is an inspiring song about pacifism (I'm all for one of those!), and Easy Going Evening (My Mama's Call) might be my favorite on the album, a slow, relaxing harmonica solo over a jazzy backdrop. Tremendous.<br />So yes, this is a total classic release that should be heard by everybody. It was what got me started on Stevie, and I revisit it quite often.yes, this is a total classic release that should be heard by everybody.

0751532711|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but eventually I had to admit that there wasn't much hard information contained within the covers.  The first couple of chapters describing the initial lessons of Kiyosaki's Rich Dad were interesting from an educational perspective.  Also, Kiyosaki's opinions on fear are applicable in many areas of life and not just for the financial issues he's describing here.  However, as others have noted, there is no real financial advice here beyond \\"invest\\" (in real estate, no less, which only dates the book) and \\"form a corporation\\" which is then not explained in detail.  Not only is there a lack of useful information, his tone sometimes shifts from perfunctory to degrading in only a few words.  At times, he claims to have respect for those less financially successful than himself when a few paragraphs later he strongly implies that anyone in the middle class working a day job is some kind of sucker.  As someone who has found relative success in a profession that Mr. Kiyosaki would most definitely label \\"craftsman,\\" I can say with all assuredness that if we craftsman did not make anything of value, men like Kiyosaki would have nothing to sell so he might want to rethink his logic a bit.  To put in a better perspective for Mr. Kiyosaki, one might say that if all of his advisers were only as smart as he is about a subject of which he knows little, there would be no experts he could possibly hire to advise him.  In the end, I'm glad I borrowed Rich Dad, Poor Dad from the library, which let me save the eighteen dollars I might have spent to invest in something that's more of an asset than this tome.
B0000024RZ|4.0|I don't get why so many people are quick to jump on this as the weakest disc of Dylan's acoustic period. I actually think it's pretty good myself - about as good as Freewheelin', which I find to be slightly overrated (good, though) - both are far behind my pick for the best acoustic disc, Another Side Of, but whatever. Onto the review.<br />Now, let's be fair, there are a couple weak songs on this album. I don't find either Ballad of Hollis Brown or North Country blues enlightening, well-intentioned as both protests surely are, they don't have any musical or lyrical interest. I'm not crazy about Boots of Spanish Leather, either; it's not nearly as touching as Girl from the North Country, nor is it as complex and insightful as Don't Think Twice, It's All Right, my favorite Dylan love song. Whereas Don't Think Twice has some clever, self-depricating humor to match its jibes at the former lover, Spanish Leather is merely morose and meandering (Alliteration is fun!), not making tis point until the end of the song - by that point, I've long since tuned out. And Restless Farewell left me, well... restless. Is that the most obvious insult in history for that song? Most likely. But it applies, because it's not a terribly exciting tune.<br />Now let's get to the good stuff. You don't need me here telling you the prophetic title track is great: just listen to it, because it's more than worth hearing. Even better is my personal favorite, One Too Many Mornings. Yes, subsequent live versions (particularly the Rolling Thunder version) gave it more cathartic power, but it's a moving song regardless. With God On Our Side is another undisputable highlight, probably the one with the strongest, most thought-provoking lyrics on the album: it's also a common target for the numerous people who don't like this disc. Yes, it's long, and no, the melody isn't all that exciting. But if you zone in on the lyrics, you'll find it's one of his best written songs. And I highly advise you focus on Only a Pawn in Their Game's lyrics, too, a strong protest against racism and how politicians use it for power. My issue with the song is the rambling, unfocused, downright distracting guitar part. The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll is a striking song about William Zantzinger's real-life racist murder of barmaid Hattie Carroll. The song digs pretty deep, deep enough for Zantzinger himself to be enraged by it: he denies its accuarcy to this day, but anyone who would commit a racist murder is bound to be wrong in the head. Anyone who knows anything should know that Zantzinger, and not Dylan, is the \\"No-account son of a b****\\". Enough tooting my own horn, though: good song right there. My favorite part is the last verse, where Dylan builds the suspense about the \\"fairness and justice\\" of our court system, only to reveal that Zantzinger somehow got off easy. A great move on Dylan's part, taking a swipe at the court system while he was at it. The last of my favorite songs is When the Ship Comes In. It's the only optimistic song on the album, and even then its optimism deals with the horrible death of Dylan's enemies. Maybe a bit unnecessarily spiteful, but a very solid song nonetheless, and anyway how many great Dylan songs aren't unnecessarily spiteful? Let's see, Positively 4th Street, Like a Rolling Stone, Maggie's Farm, Idiot Wind...<br />So that's my assessment, I guess. A pretty good work. Not in the first class of Dylan recordings, but with enough solid songs to make it a must for any serious Dylan fan who's heard the first-class recordings.awn in Their Game's lyrics, too, a strong protest against racism and how politicians use it for power.

B000O77RL4|4.0|Lets talk about the HD DVD version. Solid sound and video. The HD DVD has no glitches, uses the new menu.<br />The movie per se does not glorify war instead there is always a sense of doom and depression hanging from above. This movie does not glorify war. This movie is not about the brotherhood that forms when people fight a war (ie Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers). Like its brother flag of our fathers it shows how war sometimes uses big pretenses to get their soilders and nation behind them. In the end, war is a sacrifice our soilders make at a high cost. I think the movie very carefully asks the question: Is the sacrfice worth it?

B00005J8J6|3.0|Out of Led Zeppelin's first six albums, I find the most critically and commericially lauded to be the weakest, as such things often go. Zep I was a good little blues-rock album; II perfected the group's hard-rock swagger; III was surprisingly delicate with their best songwriting to date; Houses of the Holy was diverse and fun, containing my favorite of their songs (Over the Hills and Far Away); Physical Graffiti was bloated, but amusingly so and with some really good songs (Especially Kashmir and Ten Years Gone). This has its moments, but overall it isn't any better than the surrounding albums.<br />Let's see, Black Dog is an okay song: good guitar parts, but run-of-the-mill lyrics that sound like the invention of a horny high schooler. Rock and Roll is a top-notched tune: powerhouse drumming, all kinds of cool riffs. Battle of Evermore has a nice folky mystical vibe and excellent vocals by Sandy Denny, annoying vocals by Robert Plant. So what else is new? Stairway to Heaven is sacred ground to most Zeppelin fans, but in truth there are far better songs out there. I won't comment on its radio play - the fact is, for all the virtue of Page's guitar parts, I see the lyrics as rather silly pompous pseudomystical nonsense. The riff and guitar solo are what legends are made of, though.<br />After that, proceed with caution! Out of the last four songs, one is the overall best song on the album, one is the worst, and two fall in the \\"bad\\" camp. Misty Mountain Hop is one of the more annoying songs on the album: it's not as funny as it wants to be, and that keyboard riff doesn't do a thing for me. I know it was a big hit and it's highly regarded, but I don't like it one bit. Four Sticks is even worse, a disgrace to Zeppelin's respectable name. Sorry, but I can't stand this song at all: the buzzing synthesizer sound effect thing, the shrieked vocals, and the rambling, boring lyrics about rivers running dry (could be a dirty metaphor, of course, given the group) just bug me immensly. Goin' to California isn't much better, sensitivity from a group with the subtlety of a sledgehammer: they had already done some good stuff with being sensitive on III, and would do so again with the Rain Song and Ten Years Gone, but this just sounds forced. And this segways right into my favorite: When the Levee Breaks, a tremendous blues jam. Everything about that song screams \\"awesome\\"; thundering drum intro, excellent blues riff, wailing harmonica... cool!<br />So a bunch of people are gonna vote me not helpful for this, but I don't care. Some people will probably flame me. I will ignore them. That's all, I guess..

B000OHZL1C|5.0|Meet Joe Black is an excellent choice to add to your HD DVD collection.  It has a remarkable picture and is a touching movie in one complete package.  It features a unique blend of drama and comedy.     In fact, Meet Joe Black along with Seven are among my favorite Brad Pitt movies; looking at this title and comparing it with Seven (unfortunately only on standard DVD) shows you the versatility of Pitt.  Anthony Hopkins is the perfect choice as a 65 year old Chairman of the Board that has nothing left to experience in life until he comes face to face with Joe Black aka Death.      The writing in this film is very interesting and something that can be enjoyed by teens and adults alike.  If you need a good love story that involves drama, comedy and good overall fun look no further than Joe Black.  The only thing about the HD DVD version, I feel is the voices, they are a little low on volume; the overall sound is pretty good though.  Its a bit short on extras, only a picture montage, a unique my scenes feature, and a 10 minute behind the scenes; however with the film being over 3 hours long with a perfect picture, you won't feel the need to look forward to any extras. Other than that, its a perfect title to round out your HD DVD collection.

0441013074|4.0|Early reviews on this novel convinced me to place it fairly far down on my list of new purchases. That was a mistake. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the book thoroughly. The flaws will be familiar to Reynolds readers. Reynolds often introduces major plot elements that never pan out, and this book has lots of them. A great deal is made, for example, about the radio in Susan White's apartment, but it never amounts to anything. There are intimations of nefarious dealings by important secondary characters that are never resolved one way or the other. Reynolds characters (and corporate groupings like the Threshers and Slashers) are sometimes weak on motivation, and, as others have commented here, the motivations of the bad guys make no sense at all. It's not unusual for bad guys to have poorly developed motivations--you know, they're just evil. I can think of good reasons for the bad guys to be doing what they're doing (or at least part of what they're doing), but the reasons given in the novel don't add up. Don't let that stop you from reading the book, though. It's got enough interesting ideas, suspense, and action for most readers.

1427201439|4.0|This review applies specifically to the new audiobook version of Dune.  I would generally rate Frank Herbert's Dune as one of the greatest sci fi books of all time (5 stars), but the audiobook version lacks something in its portayal.  The reading switches between a single person and a cast, the main difference being that some chapters have the one reader doing the voices of the book's characters and then the voices are being done by a distinctly different series of individuals.  Most of the time this makes little difference, but there are enough instances where the portayal of a character is so different between the cast's rendering and the single reader's that it becomes very distracting.  For example, Count Fenring is a totally different character while being read by the one reader than when he has his own cast member doing the voice.  This was enough to pull me out of the story and cause me to reflect on why the flip back and forth between the styles of audiobook reading.  So, this telling of Dune loses one star for its confusing rendering.

B000P7V45S|5.0|I just acquired the Japanese pressing of this CD. The first disc is SACD and sounds terrific. I know these have been remixed but I hear things I've never heard before. I've had this on import vinyl (1976) and the previous remaster, also from Japan. The second disc has the album in Dolby Digital and DTS plus the video content. I can't say enough about the SACD version and the incredible sound quality. I can't say I'm too impressed with the Dolby and I don't have DTS playback so I can't attest to that. The video content is NTSC, region 0 and 16x9 widescreen when applicable. The Japanese version is pricy; $40 - $80 depending on the source. It comes in an extremely accurate replica of the original album cover with textured sleeve and the CD face replicating the Famous Charisma Label as it appeared on the vinyl label. If you are a fan of this album and have SACD capability, the more expensive disc may be worth the cash outlay. This is, I believe, the ultimate version of this record.
B000068UXF|2.0|If you want a Frau for the singing alone then buy a CD -- if you want something to look at you will be disappointed. This is very typical Gunter Schneider-Siemsen. If you like his productions you may like this DVD -- personally I hate his productions as he always updates something or makes it too modern. The best production on Video is one from Paris in the 1980's - the video is very dark, but it is a great production, very magical and captivating. In short it has everything this staging does NOT. Someone read the libretto and the state directions for the Paris staging, something not done for this version. Very dull and prosaic visually. The singing is good, but then for the singing you can buy a CD and not have to look at this terrible staging.
B00004TJKI|4.0|3.5 stars.  I don't know whether I like this film because it's good or because I got such a kick out watching so many legendary actors in the begining of their careers.  Oh, I did chuckle quite a bit watching Jimmy Stewart say \\"panties\\" a lot.  This was probably a book and movie inspired by the Perry Mason phenomenon.  If anything watching this movie tells me that the judicial system of the 1950s was very scary.  An irrational impulse was a legal defense?  Say what?  Doesn't that cover every crime ever committed?  You know right from wrong, but you do it anyway because you can't fight the impulse?  And what about introducing a witness, with a long criminal record with heresay material in the final hour?  Forget that the man wasn't on any witness list.  Then again neither was Ms. Pilant.  What about the veil suggests that the rape victim deserved what she got becase she didn't wear a girdle?  Say what?  Or that the doctor couldn't deduce whether she was raped or not because she was matured and married.  Say what? And why would you get a client to sign a promissory note after you get them off as opposed to before?  Anyway, Jimmy Stewart, George C. Scott and Lee Remick were good.  The plot just needed a little more work.  But I still enjoyed it.  Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining film.
B000002UAR|5.0|Simply no other album comes close to revolver in its originality, simple yet complex song patterns, and overall variety... This was the year 1965-1966, and in many ways a miracle year for the history of popular music and largely due to this great work of art... Right from the first coughing heard before 'taxman' comes in to the soultrip of 'tomorrow never knows' and all that goes in between... it predates sgt pepper's by a full two years, and arguably has had more wideranging impact than any other album made in the history of popular music. Each song speaks for itself. John, Paul, George, and Ringo became universally great and admired after rubber soul and revolver came out...if they had stopped making music after revolver, they would still be considered the greatest rock group that ever existed...
B000OPOANE|5.0|Fantastic format, giving the buyer a unique perspective on the production of the band's latest studio material.  The \\"behind the scenes\\" video was truly entertaining.  One should be cautioned, however, that this format cannot be played in a standard CD player.
B000002UAU|5.0|this is a very great beatles album undoubtedly. A masterwork in many ways... it has gone into the history of western culture as a revolutionary album defining the times,the feelings, and ramifications of cultures in crossroads of expressionism, vulnerability, and abandonment. Most of the songs float into each other with different colors, moods, statements, and imageries, a rarely achieved feat even by the fab four...the song structures are complex, with impeccable musicianship, lyrical brilliance, and great singing(as always!). The only oddball song on the album and yet a great relief from the deep moodiness of the album is John's 'goodmorning, goodmorning' which kind of heralds the calm before the eventual storm: 'a day in the life'(which follows the conclusion portion of the theme song...) 'A Day in the life' is the type of masterpiece that most artists spend a lifetime trying to emulate, parallel, and equal but just can not...as amply evidenced after decades passed... Only these four artists in time could have achieved this musical zenith... A work of art that defies definition... Harrison's 'within you without you' is east-meets-west at its deepest, a  profoundly philosophical song indeed... 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds' is another diamond on the album amidst so many... there is little or no weakness in this album which is uniformly great and each song insertion was after mammoth thinking and contemplation though the beatles always underestimated this aspect of their album making...it didn't just become a multi-concept masterwork by chance! it was made with great labor, imagination, dedictaion, belief and of course genius... A love's labor never lost in this case...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I just loved watching this set of DVDs. I like it more than the Discovery Channel one...
B0000669JL|5.0|This album is classic because all the songs on it are classics and its the best selling reggae album of ALL TIME.  I just want you to know this before you get it:  You are going to buy this album, you are going to love it, and then you're going to look for what else you can buy from Bob Marley.  Every one of his albums is classic.  You can't go wrong with anything by Bob Marley (can you tell he's my favorite artist?).      So, if you think you're going to want everything by Bob Marley, here is a list of his studio albums (in order from oldest to newest) Catch A Fire, Burnin', Natty Dread, Rastaman Vibration, Exodus (the album of the century according to TIME magazine), Kaya, Survival, Uprising, and Confrontation (released after he died).  Get ALL of those.  After you have that, you won't need Legend because you'll have every song.  Then go ahead and buy \\"Babylon By Bus\\" and \\"Live at the Roxy 1976,\\" his two best live albums.  If your thirst still isn't quenched, buy a compilation of his Studio One releases (originally released as singles so there isn't one album to buy...I'd recommend the Dejavu Retro Gold Collection).  The only thing you can get after that are rare singles, and I'd recmmend the \\"Songs of Freedom\\" box set for that.    That's how I'd go about it, but then again I love Bob.  You have to decide for yourself whether you just want some Bob or everything by Bob.  Either way, you CAN'T lose.
B00005JMAH|3.0|This review MAY be a bit of a spoiler, so please try not to read this unless you've read all 7 books. :)    The biggest gripe I have with this movie is when the Firebolt appears.  I resent that they do not show McGonagal taking the broom and examining it for possible curses and/or hexes, then giving the Firebolt back to Harry after it had been thoroughly examined and found to NOT have any curses or hexes.  This is why I say this movie does not stay ENTIRELY with the book.  This moves does stay with the book OVERALL.  I just don't like where they brought in the appearence of the Firebolt, although, for the way the movie was made, it works for the movie.  But I still would rather they had stayed more with the book.    But I do have to say that the filming of Buckbeak was absolutely TERRIFIC!!! :) :o :)  He looked so real, like an actual real live hippogryph, as though the animal really existed.  If you buy the movie for only one reason, Buckbeak would be it.  It's worth it to see just Buckbeak! :)    However, another slight gripe I have is the \\"modernizing\\" of the clothes worn when the kids are not in class.  DO all the kids, especially those from wizarding families, actually wear \\"muggle\\" clothes when not in their classes?  How do wizarding families dress casually?  How \\"modern\\" do the clothes have to be?    Another gripe I have about the movie itself is they don't have Harry returning to the Dursley's at the end of the year.  Before book 7, I thought that was really important, but now I'm not so sure.  All I can say is that it would have stayed more with the book had they included Harry going back to the Dursley's.    The Dementors were mostly what I'd imagined what they'd look like, but they showed too many pictures of the air turning cold around them.  Just the dementors on the train, at the Quidditch match and at the end are enough, I feel.  Had they cut out the pictures of the air turning cold around the Dementors, they would have had more time to stay more withthe book. :)    As for the picture and sound effects, I thought they were all great.    To summarize, the movie stays with the book, on the whole, but there are a few places where they do NOT stay with the book.  However, the movie is worth the money just to see Buckbeak! :)
B00005LANG|5.0|Time Magazine's Album Of The Century.  Need I say more?    If you want one Bob Marley studio album that represents everything he believes in, this is it.  Don't hesitate.  You should own this already.
B000PY52EU|3.0|I know I am in the minority here, but truthfully I did not see the great virtues in this movie that others did.    \\"Black Snake Moan\\" to me appears to be a very mixed success at combining two types of Hollywood genre films:  the Southern pastoral (\\"Color Purple\\", \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\") and the teenage exploitation flick (\\"Kids\\", \\"Thirteen\\").    To be sure, the movie has its strong points: 1)excellent cinematography and 2) Samuel Jackson.  But those two things aren't enough to extract the film from being bogged down in Southern stereotypes.  Christina Ricci spends so much time prancing around in her underwear that it finally goes beyond the pale.  It's obvious that the director is purposefully fetishizing her--that's why the panties stay white no matter how much dirt she rolls in.    Other characters have the feel of being \\"borrowed\\" from other movies.  I can't credit this film with being very original; everything seems recycled and secondhand.     Too shallow to be taken seriously as a drama, and too contrived to enjoy as a guilty pleasure, this is a movie I can't give any more than 3 stars.  I know that won't sit well with some, but that's my opinion and I'm stickin' to it.
B00005KB9T|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is classic Wailers (not originally released as \\"Bob Marley & The Wailers\\").  The only dilemma you have is whether to buy this one or the \\"Deluxe\\" edition with the jamaican versions of the songs.  If you're like me and LOVE EVERYTHING by Bob Marley, you'll want the deluxe ed.  If not, this one will do.
0061191981|5.0|but I ended up reading it for myself.  This book was great!  I thought he did a really good job writing it, and I couldn't put it down.  I love Hell's Kitchen, and now you know why he does what he does.  This book does not disappoint!
0689505698|5.0|My son had to have this book.  Just from looking at the cover one time!  And once we had it in the house, it has become the forever read book.  It's illustrations by Helen Oxenbury are amazing and the story will delight children of all ages.  It's not scary but it does make you think a bit.  I highly recommend this book!
B000NE8D20|5.0|You can sit there and analyse the whole book from a literary & gramatical point of view to death... but some books simply touch us deep inside. They seem to shake our emotions and somehow we connect... maybe we all wish we had a story to tell!<br /><br />Totally recomend it if anyone wants to read a book that is short and sweet!<br /><br />Its a great book, very emotional so prepare yourself for tears. The movie is fab too.
B000RJO578|5.0|This movie completely blew me away. I expected it to just be a cop mock-up a la Reno 911, but it was so much more than that.     Of course, part of it does run along those lines. But the story contains an excellent twist at the middle. This town has a very dark secret.     But more important than that, it is hilarious. I've watched this twice today. It just keeps getting funnier. This is by far the best comedy to come out since even before Shaun of the Dead.    I try to think of something that I don't like about this movie, but there's very little to speak of. I would've liked to have seen more of Angel's stint in London. There's a complaint.     Now, everything else about the movie is worthy of praise. If you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll like this even more.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I visited Africa and got shots that others, with more expensive cameras, didn't get.  Why?  Because I had the compact SB-400 Speedlight to use with my Nikon D-40; and others didn't want to be bothered with carrying their big flash units.  I took some great pictures of Leopards and Cheetahs in low light.  If I need flash, I hardly ever use my built-in flash.  It's so easy to just clamp on the SB-400. Often, I would just leave the flash on the camera, it takes up so little space.  So....I really recommend the SB-400 Speedlight.  I just keep it in a small nook in my camera bag; and I can get 60ft.+  coverage. Oh, be sure to angle the flash up for portraits.  It gives you wonderful flesh tones.
B00005JPQR|3.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" has much in common with this summer's earlier \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" in that both movies are essentially one long chase sequence involving a protagonist whose ingenuity and grace under pressure are surpassed only by his seeming indestructibility.<br /><br />This is the third, and, we're told, final installment in the Robert Ludlum series about Jason Bourne, the agent programmed by a rogue element of the CIA to be a mindless killing machine.  In \\"Ultimatum,\\" Bourne, who has long since disowned his professional-assassin past, is being hunted down by the Langley operatives who created him in the first place, believing that they risk career-destroying exposure and criminal prosecution if they don't silence their boy permanently.<br /><br />Acclaimed director Paul Greengrass (\\"Bloody Sunday,\\" \\"United 93\\") brings his considerable filmmaking skills to bear on the material, sprinting headlong right out of the starting gate and giving us few moments to catch our breath on the way to the finish line.  By employing a jittery hand-held camera throughout, Greengrass intensifies the chaotic nature of many of the scenes and brings a spontaneity and immediacy to the action on screen.  In addition, the razor-sharp editing and plethora of locales (the film makes stops in New York, Moscow, London, Paris, Madrid, Tangier and a number of other cities) add greatly to the movie`s effectiveness.  We're never in any one place for very long, and a mere blink of an eye or lapse of attention at any crucial moment could spell disaster for anyone dutifully trying to follow the plot.<br /><br />I must say, however, that for all the tremendous moviemaking pyrotechnics on display here, the movie suffers a bit from distention and overkill in the long run.  After about the first half hour or so of nonstop action, the movie becomes a trifle wearying and redundant.  We find ourselves wishing it would actually put the brakes on for a few moments so we could get to know the characters to a greater extent.  For almost the entire movie (until the final sequences, that is), Bourne is little more than a nonstop running machine, dodging bullets, karate-chopping bad guys, jumping off rooftops, crashing through windows.  All this is very impressive as stunt work and action-figure hoopla, but a little of it goes a very long way after awhile.<br /><br />Matt Damon has become very comfortable in Bourne's skin over the course of the three movies, but the role doesn't provide him with a great deal to sink his teeth into in terms of genuine acting.  David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Albert Finney also do well in their assorted roles, but like Damon, they are limited by the restrictive nature of the filmmaking.<br /><br />Thus, for all its big-name, high-priced talent, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is more a director's picture than an actor`s, making Greengrass the default star of the movie when all is said and done.  And if we are ultimately left wondering if it may not be just a bit too much of a good thing, well, the goodness itself is treat enough these days, I guess.ent.

B000IOM1Y6|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to this cd I do not get tired of it. The wonderful musical creativity is totally enjoyable, and the vocals are beautifully harmonic. There is a perfect blend of heavy rhythm and melody. This band is one-of-a-kind.
0143038419|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book.  I had great expectations, but I have to agree with some others that the constant whining and crying was hard to take.  I don't feel as though she achieved any level of enlightenment, as it seemed more important to convey her very judgmental comments regarding ALL Republicans.  It sounds like she is more of an immature Democratic tifoso.   The Dr. Phil type character at the Ashram was so grating that I couldn't wait for him to go home!!  The charitable inclination to help the family in Bali would have been admirable if she had not used it to write a best-seller.  I do wish her the best on her spiritual journey.

B000001GOZ|1.0|Listen to just about any other recording and you basically know what Mahler's 6th symphony is about.  But if you listen to this one alone, you wouldn't have much to go on.<br /><br />The most relentlessly tense of Mahler's symphonies, to say that this recording comes off lame and dull would have to be an understatement.  Even the famous hammer blows in the last movement are blended into the other percussion as to make them inaudible.  For sure, there are the exultant climaxes, splendidly recorded for the most part (the brass are simply too overpowering for the strings in the last movement), as there would be in any reading of the symphony.  But recording is not a substitute for interpretation.<br /><br />One thing I found very troublesome was the proportioning of tempi, especially in the first movement.  When there is a return to the original tempo after the exposition repeat, it is slower than the first time around.  This occurs throughout the movement, so the 'feel' of a basic tempo is lost, robbing the movement of structural coherency.  Perhaps editing problems on retakes?<br /><br />Mr. Cool continues his cycle of Mahler symphonies, apparently a 'Mahler' for the 21st century.  Perhaps.  But conducting Mahler symphonies does not make one a Mahler specialist.  A conductor who never approaches the symphonic repertoire from a narrative point of view, Boulez doesn't interpret so much as clones the written notes from the score through the voice of an orchestra into sound.  The Vienna Philharmonic, after years of performing all of the Mahler symphonies with Bernstein, Maazel, and Abbado, seems to play by itself.  Boulez concentrates his efforts in recording balanced textures, clean intonation, beating clear time (Schoenberg called it a 'takt beater'), while the interpreting is left to the orchestra.  Voila!  There you have it! - a Mahler Sixth for the 21st century.

To me this album sounds a little more pop-country than his previous albums but it grows on you.  However it still features Brads masterfull manipulation of his Crook Custom Teles and sense of humor.  If you like Time Well Wasted you will like this.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|THE GREATEST KISS DVD AROUND, until vol 2 of course !!    For huge Kiss fans like myself, it is a dream cometrue, kiss concerts from the 70's.    In the 70's Kiss were huge, no one could triumph over their reign of rock.    The concerts are great, but I always wonder if Ace did actually play in live concerts ? Hmmmmmmmm .....    Oh well never mind, it's a great dvd, buy it, now !!
B00005JODK|5.0|I don't write reviews nor do I care for musicals.  I loved this movie.  It relayed the important message to stand up for what you believe and it was truly uplifting.  The cast was phenomenal, the songs were hysterical, and John Travola hasn't lost his dance moves.  I honestly think if most people give it a chance and understand this is a movie with a message, albeit light-hearted in it's deliverance, they will love it.
0897500482|5.0|This is the bible of fighting science.  Edited from thousands of notes that Bruce Lee personally wrote, \\"Tao\\" is full of insights into martial arts and fighting, as well as Eastern philosophy.  The book itself reads more like a series of soundbites or excerpts from a textbook.  This can make it harder to read in that there is rarely a linear expansion upon a particular idea; in the same vein, however, the text doesn't come across as dry as a textbook, because one can take one or a series of notes and meditate upon them.  That is truly the key when going through this book: it must be studied, more than read.    Lee's overriding philosophy seems to be that fighting must be natural and \\"alive\\", fuctional and efficient.  In light of this, he casts away many of the classical teaching methods used by other arts, such as deep stances, contrived footwork, and the hands in an artificial 'ready' possition.  He draws his thoughts on mobility, attacking, defending and such on his own practical experience and on the writtings of great fencers and boxers.  Inside this book he presents his thoughts on the straight lead, the use of kicks, grappling and foul tactics, feinting, parrying, the Five Ways of Attack, footwork, upper-body evasions, combinations, et al.    This is a must-have for any martial artist's collection.  It represents the intellectual and philisophical observations of one of the most well-known martial artists of the modern era, and someone who took a scientific approach to hand-to-hand combat.

And to anyone who doesn't know HD-DVD is better quality than Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray has worse compression hence the need for more space which Blu-Rays have, but it doesn't mean anything.  Better picture and sound on HD DVD IMHO!

B000068FWC|5.0|This CD from Supertramp is very logical as the song states in \\"The Logical Song\\". \\"Gone Hollywood\\" starts the CD out with a piano crescendo and goes right into the song. What a great song to start off with. Next is \\"The Logical Song\\". This song tells everything about Breakfast In America for Supertramp. Goodbye Stranger is next and it is a fast paced song with a lot of guitar lyrics at the end of the song. Another good song on the CD is \\"Oh Darling\\" a very good love song. My personal favorite song on this CD is \\"Take The Long Way Home\\". I love to sing this song whenever it comes on the radio and it is easy to sing. My favorite line in the song is So you think your a romeo playing a part in a picture show. \\"Child Of Vision\\" ends the CD and is very different from any other song on the CD. It has a lot of guitar riffs in it and it seems to go on forever. This is one of Supertramp's best CD's that they have ever had out and it is a true asset to my CD collection.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|If season two of \\"Veronica Mars\\" doesn't quite live up to season one, it realy doesn't matter - it's still spectacular television. The mystery of season two manages to hit close to home for everyone, and the suspects are rampant throughout, leaving you guessing right up to the finale. My biggest complaint is that Wallace seems to get lost in the mix of the expanded cast (this was a much bigger problem in season 3). Kristen Bell puts in another superb performance, giving us glimpses of the sometimes sad, always guarded, but inherently sweet soul that lies beneath Veronica's brash, snarky and wip-smart exterior. If Jason Dohring's Logan isn't quite as much fun as season one, he at least seems to grow up. Best of all is Enrico Colantoni's Keith, who took over the role of best TV dad from \\"The OC\\"'s Sandy Cohen during season one and keeps going strong in season two, loving his daughter unconditionally yet constantly fearing that she might not turn out alright, that the dark goings on in Neptune might damage her for good.

B000OVLBF8|3.0|Despite NOT being a Nicholas Cage fan, I was very hopeful about this film. I mean, how can you go wrong with a character with a flaming skull riding a very rad, flaming bike? Unfortunately, this movie managed to get it wrong on many levels. Casting was a big problem. Cage is a fine actor but he can not carry off a larger-than-life superhero character and was constantly flipping between being overly melodramatic and flopping at attempts to be humorous. Cage was also, I feel, too mature an actor for the role. Quirks that might have been amusing/annoying with a younger actor just seemed somehow pitiful for a man his age. (I don't have a problem with mature superheroes. I have a problem with mature superheroes with the characteristics of a shallow twenty-year old.) I think a better choice would have been a talented but relatively unknown actor for the lead. Peter Fonda was competent but Wes Bentley had more villian flair. Eva Mendes was stuck in the thankless role of the stereotypical 'working girl' love interest. Ironically, I found the supporting actors much more interesting to watch (Peter Callan and Rebel Wilson, as examples).     I could have forgiven this movie a lot if the plot wasn't riddled with holes big enough to drive a flaming elephant through, never mind a motorcycle. (SPOILER ALERT: The motorcycle blows away cars, and burns billboards and lizards but manages to never cause real harm to innocent humans. The painfully stereotypical cops accuse Blaze of somehow single-handedly killing a bar-load of Hell's Angels bikers -- who have obviously died of some seriously unnatural causes -- and their only evidence is his slightly charred license plate found in the city, nowhere near the scene of the actual crime. And there's no path of melted tar to tie the bar with the rail yard so assuming the flaming bike was involved at both scenes is quite a stretch. The same cops are 'smart' enough to track Blaze by his motorcyle's licence plate... but not smart enough to stake out his residence after Blaze escapes from jail. And that's just the tip of the plot-hole iceberg.) Plot holes are distracting, especially when numerous, and they prevent you from immersing yourself fully into a movie. Stretching reality is one thing; throwing it out the window is quite another.    X-Men and Spiderman proved quite nicely that it IS possible to make a solid first movie in an established franchise, despite the inherent difficulties, IF you have tight writing and the right director -- two elements that were missing in Ghost Rider. It's not surprising that the writer and the director were the same guy and that this guy also wrote the screenplay for Daredevil and Electra. 'Nuff said.    Things I liked: The f/x were interesting. Not perfect but fun. (Skull head was way too large. Skulls are not supposed to be the same size as, or larger than, the fleshed-out head. The Ghost Rider's head looked more like a Halloween mask than an actual skull. But the flame effects were excellent, as was the bike design, and the Western Ghost Rider's design and horse.) The scene of both Riders riding together was, I think, the best part of the movie. Not enough to justify the price of a ticket or DVD but nice eye-candy to take away some of the sting of the sloppy, predictable writing and silly plot contrivances. Unfortunately, the f/x went overboard at times. Just because you CAN flip cars and blow up things doesn't mean you SHOULD, especially if it only serves to burn holes in the story. The acting was competent but lacking a certain flair in too many cases, the exception being the supporting/background characters who were quite enjoyable to watch.  The reworked, updated \\"Riders in the Sky\\" was a nice, haunting touch, especially when coupled with the dual Riders scene.    A few tweaks, a different director/writer, and a younger, preferably less well-known actor for the lead and I think Ghost Rider could have been an excellent comic-adaption movie. As it stands now, it'sjust an example of failed potential. A little fun, a little excitement... but little else.

B000OVLBEO|5.0|This is a 2-Disc extended cut version with over 2 hours of special features, in widescreen version at approximately 123 minutes, or a hair over 2 hours.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage plays Johnny, the son of an Evil Keneval type guy.  As a matter of fact, both father and son do the stunt motorcycle jumps for a carney type act.  When young Johnny finds out daddy has severe cancer, he sort of accidentally makes a deal with the devil.  He sells his soul to extend daddy's life. That kind of puts a halt to his future love life with girlfriend Rachel.  The good news is, Johnny gets to stay alive and wait until the devil needs him to perform a special task.  Johnny gets to be the devil's bounty hunter (The Ghost Rider) when the time is right.  He goes after the bad guys and collects their souls for the devil, he also gets to try to hunt down and battle Blackheart (the devil's son) over a list of souls from a long time ago.  This time, Peter Fonda does NOT ride the cycle.  He plays the devil.<br /><br />It's the story about a good guy who makes a mistake trying to help his father and winds up fighting evil.

0140306013|5.0|This is an amazing book and one of my all time favorites. The rabbits may as well be humans, as Adams give them distinct personalities. It's about the stuggle for survival in the world, as well as in a community. The story parallels our own human struggle in society, community and against forces we can't control.
091581112X|5.0|The book is amazing, it is written so beautifully, and really left me with a warm and loving feeling. Sanaya is def. among my favorite authors. There is so much information in this book that is useful in life, its a must read!!
0156027321|5.0|This book is kind of like a Seinfeld episode. All these unbelievable events slowly circle until they become more and more likely. At that point, the author turns everything upside-down and you are left with more questions than answers. Wonderfully ambiguous. Not for the faint of heart.
B000P0I4O4|2.0|A contract killer and his team run into an ex-cop and his kid in the woods.<br /><br />Problem is, in this movie it doesn't really matter that John Cusack's character is an ex-cop. It barely figures into the plot or his actions or decisions at all. This is not a Die Hard lookalike (the actor or the movie). He could have been a circus clown, and the movie would have essentially been the same (except for one tussle). It doesn't really matter that Morgan Freeman's character is an experienced, ex-military contract killer. He radiates danger, but he isn't able to sufficiently confound an ex-cop.<br /><br />A key point, for example, is his desire to be found by his buddies versus Cusack's demand that he go with them. Freeman could have simply refused to budge and lain on the ground. What could Cusack do? Yet Freeman goes with them - because Cusack's waving a gun in his face? Come on! But he does have a couple of good lines. (Watch for one of them delivered to a female hiker.)<br /><br />His buddies don't fare much better for trained killers. One of them is dispatched in a truly amateurish fashion. The action is nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The US Marshalls ... also clueless and careless. The only point of the movie is that the right-wing US government kills its own citizens, and the  target deserves to die because he opposes stem cell research (and supports groups who oppose it through violence). Whoopee.<br /><br />Entertaining enough with enough brain cells on hold.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Antoine Fuqua is back so you know that the establishment and/or authorities can't be trusted. Mark Wahlberg is very credible as a special ops trained ex-marine whose guts, discipline, resourcefulness and savvy eventually trumph over the overtly evil forces of...evil. Danny Glover, Elias Koteas, and Ned Beatty chew the scenery. Stuff blows up. More stuff blows up. We learn about the minutae of sniping, treating combat wounds with kitchenware, assembling explosives from the shelves at Home Depot.
B000RJO578|3.0|It's definitely not in the \\"hysterical\\" category. Moments of understated humor throughout, nothing side-splitting; more overt in the second half. The main character spoofs action movie staples and lines. The main plot point, though, the reason for all the killings, when finally revealed, *is* hilarious indeed, one of the funniest concepts ever, almost worth watching the whole movie.<br /><br />Some quite grisly denouements, one or two of which are guaranteed to make you wince. The explosive ending is completely unnecessary. Timothy Dalton is wonderfully greasy.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|I remember this set first appearing on LPs, and then CDs, at premium prices.  It was a jewel then, and remastered the recordings are wonderful.  More than twenty years after the LP set release, this is a tremendous bargain.  How long will it stay in the catalog?  Buy this before it goes out of print.
B000QXDED6|5.0|All of the blood and gore are tempered by the great filming style of this film - similar to Sin City (Frank Miller's other pulp novel brought to the big screen).    If you like at least two of the films in my Review Title, then you'll like this one.
1594830835|4.0|Like most Baldacci books this one is longer than it should be but it held my interest on a long drive.  With the distractions of driving while listening, the unabridged book is best as you can 'miss' some of it and still keep the flow going.  Well spoken audio book worth the money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series ended far too soon! I have liked everything by Joss Whedon, and Firefly is no exception. I would call it cowboys in space, but very well done. The combination of humor, action and sci-fi is addictive. The humor in all his work is so sly - it has a feel of real-worldness to it - that there are many truths and more depth than most realize to Whedon's work. I recommend it just for the humor, not to mention the action and adventure. I would also recommend buying the movie Serenity to go with this series. It ties up all the loose ends and gives more of a feeling of closure.
B000RJO578|5.0|I loved \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous collaboration.  It was a wonderful homage to horror movies--both a parody and, oddly enough, a horror movie in and of itself.  \\"Hot Fuzz\\" takes that concept one step further--by combining parody and action, it creates a self-aware action movie that stands as both a parody and one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see.<br /><br />Nick Angel is a top London cop--he's so good, he's making the rest of the force (excuse me, that's SERVICE) look bad.  So they ship him out to Sanford, a peaceful village that hasn't seen a murder in 20 years.  Or has it?  As Angel befriends the Inspector's son (and fellow policeman officer), he begins to see that Sanford isn't what it seems; the murder rate is nill, but the accident rate is astronomical.  And when a local business owner keeps showing up at the scenes of accidents...could something fishy be going on in this peaceful English village?<br /><br />Indeed, something is.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver knock-out performances yet again, as does the superb supporting cast (including Timothy Dalton, who manages to steal most of his scenes--not an easy task, considering the talent in this movie).  Pegg and Wright's writing remains top-notch; the movie is witty almost to the point of being unbearable.  I rented it Friday night, went out and bought it Saturday, and watched it twice more.  It's that good.  \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is quite simply one of the best comedies to come out in years; it is smart, funny, and just damn FUN.
B000J10EQU|4.0|visually great bluray movie in 1080p or i, at 720 just not as sharp.  5 of 5 picture.  The movie  3.5 of 5  why? because of the vast oppinions of the people who have come to love superman, some will be pleased some wont. My review is not my oppinion but just a generalization of how overall people will feel about the film.  Routh is no reeve, but he filled the shoes better than anyone else could, but many would agree that the film was to early and routh was too young.  Also some alterations to the costume that will be debatable to many. Some great special effects though, an original john williams honored sound.  The intro we all wanted and expected.  Lastly I personally think that expectations were not quite met, the teaser trailer brought me back in time. The movie just didnt do that. Again this is only an oppinion and also is debatable.  Definitley worth the buy though!!!!  ok i contradicted myself! oh well
0380789035|5.0|Utterly captivating.  When I wasn't actually reading the book, I was all the while thinking about it, for the story and its setting and characters where always lurking in the back of mind.<br /><br />I had the fortunate, albeit coincidental, oppurtunity of road-tripping through some of the setting's south-eastern states, namely Tennessee and Virginia, while reading the latter half of the book.  The experience became all the more real and eerily engrossing.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be challenged to reevaluate their surroundings, the state of our times, and the meaning of it all.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Batman is a great comic book movie. The pace keeps it from dragging. Jack gives an inspired effort as the Joker, Michael Keaton does well as Bruce Wayne and Batman. The supporting cast do a good job Jack Palance stands out. This is a dark violent film. The Jokers warped sense of humor gives enough laughs to to break the tension, the gadgets, weapons and vehicles are inovative. Batman has never been done better.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Megadeth really deserves more credit than it gets. After their foray into more commercial, mainstream music, they returned to straight metal with \\"The System has Failed\\". This is the follow up to that, and it stands shoulder to shoulder with that album. Which is to say, its good.    Nice crunching riffs, guitar solos that, even if not as good as their 80's music, still blow away most of Metallica's (yea I said it), combined with Mustaine's slightly less snarling but still very pissed off vocals make for some great listening. The lyrics get a bit silly in places, as some other reviewers have noted (and you'll sleep with the fishes; the answer to all my wishes!) but they're usually meaningful enough.    Megadeth is really proving how timeless they are (or I guess its more Mustaine proving how timeless he is....but whatever). Trust me kids, put down St. Anger and pick this one up. It's guranteed to give you a head bangers' neck ache by the end track.
B000002UAU|5.0|Misplaced this CD, needed this to add to our Beatles music collection. Classic Beatles.  One of the best Beatles album, need I say more.  Highly recommend.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I will be honest, when I first listened to Dream Theater's new album I didn't got it, I simply didn't like as much as I always do I just didn't dig it, I listened the first 3 songs and stop it it was difficult because I was expecting something more like octavarium (which I really love) but it was so different..... after 15 years of being a Dream Theater fan I could not believe I did not dig the new album, so 2 days later I knew I must give another chance this time I would listen to it without specting some sound or something specyfic I was just there lying on the couch listening to Systematic Chaos as if I have never listen to it and happily things started to change man something happened I was blowned away by the album I listened from start to finish then without delay watched the DVD version and upload the whole album into my IPOD and since that very date (about a month or so) I just keep playing and playing Systematic Chaos without stop and every time there is something new, something better I don't know I simply love this album, every aspect of it, once again DT gives us one helluva album    Systematic Chaos brings everything DT is, you will get prog songs, slow songs, metal right into your face songs, epic moments, man you get everything you want to listen and so much more (special version of the album is a must)    From start to finish Systematic Chaos is an amazing experience due to all the elements that are perfectly mixed.... the intro on the opening track, \\"In the prescence of the enemies pt.1\\" is really one of the most amazing intros DT has offered the whole sound is fantastic... \\"Repentance\\" with all the dialogues (so different in DT catalogue) or \\"Ministry of lost souls\\" with all that feeling through all the song absolutely amazing, I just simply keep going on but it will be better if you give it a try.    As we already read on other reviews everyone is complaining about Mike's singing and ok he is not a great singer and maybe not a good backup singer but he got guts, energy and the attitude to sing the way he does and man it does not sound that bad I really like it..... sorry man how can I give a complaint when I really love this album and every one DT release, seems I am not that objective at times...    As I have stated on my other DT reviews every DT album is so different one from the other, but everyone is so great, so brilliant and deserves not to be compared and Systematic Chaos its not an exception, 8 songs on the album and everyone is very different from the other, obviously you can listen to references of recent DT albums like Octavarium, Six degrees or ToT, but that is why every DT album is that great they have the older or classic sound but at the same time the songs are so different that became instant classics... once again if you want metal listen to ToT, if you want epic listen to Scenes or Six degrees but if you want all those sounds mixed at the same time I really believe you must listen to Systematic Chaos, this is the album in which DT gave us everything they are, not completely metal or totally prog, but the perfect mixture of Dream Theater's sound, but again so new and different than the previous albums, that the only thing you can do is enjoy and love the entire album.    I always say that every DT album is the best maybe because its new stuff but that is the truth every one is the best when they are released so now it is time to see the test of time to know how good this album really is... I had always said Images & Scenes are the best albums on DT catalogue and I will defend that always but it is getting harder and harder to do so because Dream Theater keeps releasing impressive albums, obviously that is why I love Dream Theater music, they challenge themselves on every album and so they challenge the fans... for me this is the first time that a DT album took so long to dig on me but believe me it really worth the time I invest listening all day long... Systematic is DT's new masterpiece.It will be easy to say that my favorite tracks are In the prescence of the Enemies pt.1, Prophets of War and Forsaken, because those were the first songs I really dig but being honest at this point every song on the album is a favorite.    I must mention James's vocals they are outstanding it seems like he is getting better with age, I love what he did on Octavarium, Images or Scenes but in Systematic Chaos he gave impressive vocals so different that any he has performed I really love the way he sang on the slower songs, the faster songs even though those parts where Mike is singing too, I think they are perfectly balanced... what can I say about John, Jordan, John & Mike they are the kings and it is stated on every album or every live performance, for me Dream Theater is the perfect machine an it is just getting better and better.     By the way no matter the impressive albums other amazing bands release as Symphony X, Threshold, Silent Force, Rhapsody, Pain of Salvation (bands that I really really love) Dream Theater answers with a better album, this time Systematic Chaos, as if they were trying to prove who are the kings of progressive rock.. after 20 and more years is there still any doubt about it???    I am really looking forward to see if they will come on tour here to Mexico I would love to listen Systematic Chaos live¡¡¡    By the way DT fans do not wait any longer and order your copy of Dream Theater book sounds it will be fantastic¡¡

1400079276|5.0|I finished this book quite some time ago, and it's taken me a while to review this book, because frankly, I've just been at a loss of how to write a lucid and representative review. I felt tongue-tied and \\"writer blocked\\" in the afterglow on this spellbinding adventure. Murakami took me to realms I have not reached with books for a while now, and which I am still gently floating on. I finally did decide to write though, because I think it's imperative for me to document how I felt about the book and really try and impress upon other bibliophiles that they must, must, MUST read this!    The two fundamental themes of the book are simple, and in fact, quite clichéd: one can run, but not escape, and life needs to be dealt with; and that every person has a purpose and a destiny to fulfil. The way these themes are illustrated is, however, far from simple, and to do so, Murakami shares with us two tales: one of a precocious fifteen-year old boy who leaves home in an attempt to escape his oppressions, and the other of a mentally challenged old man who needs support on many fronts to just go through daily life, but has curious abilities like being able to converse with cats and making fish rain from the sky. Both the protagonists undertake fascinating physical and metaphysical journeys which inevitably weave together at the end, but in very unusual and interesting ways. Accompanying them, or somehow associated with them, on these journeys are just a handful of other characters, who while clearly playing a supporting role, are essential to the \\"success\\" (as in some logical conclusion) of the journeys, and are enchanting in their own right.     Murakami is very successful in illustrating the key themes of the book by the end (and in fact through most of its course), even though the plot is full of events that are oftentimes difficult to follow and challenge ones understanding. The book clearly demands a suspension of physical belief (refer fish example above), much in the vein of the magic realism of Marquez and Rushdie, but somehow, it doesn't feel the same. Similarly, while it deals extensively with the abstruse and the subconscious, it does not feel like surrealistic. Instead, all the unreal parts feel very natural, and it's very easy to accept them, just like it's easy to accept the myriad of contradictions that Japan (where this book is set) seems to be. Pulling this feat off is one of the most admirable stylistic achievements of this book. Another superb aspect of this book is the characters that Murakami has created. The breadth of the characters from the two protagonists through the hilarious avatar of Colonel Sanders to the confused gay \\"woman-in-man's-mind\\" is only matched by the depth of exploration of each character. The characters draw the reader into their minds and lives, allowing the reader to understand and empathize with them to very great extents, which is remarkable given the complexity and unreal nature of a lot of the characters.     The one aspect of the book which I can imagine some readers will find frustrating is the number of events, fringe characters, situations, dialogues, and sub-plots that seem to have no bearing on the main story or the plot. I, personally, learnt a new lesson from Murakami's narrative escapades and fertile imagination. Murakami very explicitly talks about metaphors throughout the book, and I think it has a purpose. The purpose was exactly to help the reader get rid of conventional thinking and reading approaches. After being perplexed for a while, I realized that all these inexplicable things were themselves metaphors, or analogies, or abstract concepts, which needed to be accepted as such without being taken literally. Once you stop doing that, and just feel them and the impact they make on your mindset rather than looking for literal bearings on the story, everything falls into place and the reading gets taken to a new level of beauty altogether. I think this is the greatest strength of the book, not its greatest weakness, and would urge readers to take this approach so that they can truly relish this wonderful adventure.     In conclusion, I strongly recommend reading, and even owning this book. I can easily imagine that this is a book you will want to go back to again and again, if not for the whole book, for many small aspects at least. Have fun!

B000MRA5NS|5.0|This is how you keep a movie franchise going. Great story, great acting and a fast paced movie that almost never slows down(except when James is with the ladies!!)    I have watched it several times now and the more I watch the more I like.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|The movie began interestingly enough and I found myself hooked as Nic Cage's character introduced himself, his power to see into a few minutes (or was that seconds?) into the future, and how he used it in his everyday life as a magician. But I began to lose interest as the story progressed and the feds begin to try and capture him to use his powers to stop a terrorist threat.<br /><br />It wasn't helped any by the bad low budget CGI which clearly looked very fake. I think the movie would have been more interesting if it had concentrated on the love story between Cage and Biel without bringing in the terrorist threat or maybe some other conflict.<br /><br />There were some cool moments when Cage's character uses his powers to check out alternate futures, like the scene where he tries to woo Biel's character and the bomb finding scene. Nevertheless I was very disappointed at the ending. A very clich&eacute; ending, and would no doubt will get a few groans from the audience. Still, it was interesting...
B000EHSVOG|4.0|Ahhhh the 70's! This was a time of the great disaster films! For those of you not familiar with these star studded gems I will give a quick explaination. Back in the 70's Hollywood produced a bunch of disaster films and they covered just about all of them with Water(Poseidon Adventure)Fire(Towering Inferno)Earth(Earthquake)(in Sensurround!LOL!)Air(Airport)They did more, but these are the ones that were really something to see in the theaters. Each one would have more stars than 10 other first rate films combined! Kind of like the \\"Love Boat\\" but these stars were still stars! The Towering Inferno was even better than I remembered. The new special edition has a very good transfer and interesting extras. This is right up there with The Poseidon Adventure.

032147404X|5.0|If you're like me you don't want to spend too much time in the beginning learning the theory behind every aspect of photography.  Rather you want to learn what works mixed with a little of the why.  This book does just that.  I use it as reference.  It gives tips such as the best focal length and f-stop to shoot portraits or how to shoot a flower, moving race car, athlete in motion, beautiful sunset, and much more.  This way I can take pictures now, and learn the theory at a more leisurely pace.  Otherwise, I would have drowned in the theory trying to glean out the pertinent facts to ensure that my picture turned out the way I wanted it too.  I refer to this book so much that it is starting to fall apart.

B000059RL3|5.0|This album was and still is essential to the problems that existed and still do exist in the world to this day.  There could not have been a better album recorded from a political and social standpoint. Marvin left the world with a lot to think about when he recorded this masterpiece back in 71. It was a fantastic thing for Motown to do by remastering this classic album. I just wish Marvin was still alive to see how his work influenced a lot of fans as well as artist.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This movie like \\"crash\\" will take the viewer through a number of actor's lives and how they all at first seem to be different will tie in for a wonderful and un expected ending.
0762188669|5.0|I usually don't describe books as something \\"I couldn't put down\\" but this is an exception. \\"The Day of The Jackal\\" is a page-turning thriller from start to finish.<br />Frederick Forsyth puts his keen newsman's eye and pen to describing the intracacies and frustrations of police work. The author builds the French assassination plot/worldwide manhunt into a crescendo before making one final U-turn that leaves you knowing there was more to the story.<br />I could write a book about the ending itself but I'll resist doing that here so as not to spoil things for those who haven't read the book.<br />I'm tempted to look for answers in \\"The Odessa File\\" (Forsyth's other famous novel) since Odessa (a post-World War II Nazi SS diaspora society) is mentioned in \\"Jackal.\\" Yet the Detective Lebel in me suspects that most of the answers are tucked inside the taut sentences of \\"The Day of the Jackal.\\"
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins gives new meaning to the word arrogant.  This book is astounding in its hubris.  He writes venomously about religion with blinders on about atheism.  His only tools of discourse are caracature and ridicule, usually after erecting an intolerably inaccurate strawman which he can then burn down.<br /><br />I thought I'd seen the height of arrogance when I read Harry Gove's book, but Dawkins shows Harry Gove to be an isightful and tolerant human being by contrast -- Wow! What an acheivement!<br /><br />Whenever Dawkins discussed something I actually knew something about, it was clear that he didn't and hadn't bothered to discover that he didn't.  Instead he would just rail, ridicule and spew venom.  The sweet tolerance of a Dawkins would likely end up making the lions of Nero's circus look benign.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this trash.  There is a lot of better trash out there.  Even if you want to make the case for atheism, this isn't it.  It's not intellectually honest enough to be helpful.  Dawkins writes with his conclusion running and no facts need apply.  When he gets to the thought that teaching your religion to your children is a form of child abuse and that it should not be permitted, he reminded me of Plato's Republic, except Plato is actually quite religious and insightful -- Dawkins is neither.<br /><br />Just a materialistic, scientismist rant like so many others these days.  Unless you are making a study of madness among the extremely arrogant, save your money.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Weighty concepts underlie this funny-book story. The destructiveness of anger. How violence begets violence. Science unhinged from morals. Envy (that little green monster) and greed bring ruin to the world. The power of parents over children. The ability of love to soothe (but not eliminate) the savage heart.  Plenty of unreality (how would gamma radiation give a very large man/creature the ability to leap miles at a single bound?) and comic-book action to please the juvenile-minded. Outstanding special effects. Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte bring gravitas and prevent things from getting too mawkish. A stronger lead actor (playing Dr. Bruce Banner) might have made this a top-shelf sci-fi picture.
6304711905|5.0|When I think of the ultimate Western two films come immediately to mind; 'The Magnificent Seven' from '60 and 'Tombstone' from '93. When you compare the two it doesn't take long to see the similarities between these classic films and realize what sets them apart from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />1) Both films boast superior casts and many unforgetable performances.<br />2) The momentum starts to build from the very begining and never faulters on its journey to the closing credits.<br />3) The dialogue is amazing. Every word, every phrase is loaded with meaning and portent, all coupled with a plethora of quotable lines you'll never tire of hearing viewing after viewing.<br /><br />Probably the most important similarity of all is they both exude an aura of nobility about the characters involved, perfectly capturing what you might like to call the \\"noble savage\\". If you want to know what constitutes a classic western study these two films. You'll figure it out in no time.<br /><br />Wonderful performances abound; Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, the list goes on and on. However it's Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday that will forever remain my favorite.<br /><br />'Tombstone' receives my highest rating: 5 Stars!
B000065BPB|4.0|audio is flat.  reviews might indicate that the  bass is weak, but i would just call it flat. same  for the highs.  the  higher impedance works fine with a sansa mp3 player;  still can get loud.  the seal is very  quiet so high levels aren't always required.    main issue is you can only wear these for about 2  hours before feeling a numbing sensation due to the  pressure exerted.  when you first put them on,  the pressure won't appear that strong.  and actually, the pressure helps  the subsonic feel since these reproduce the lows  very accurately.
B00005JPLW|4.0|I really liked the \\"300\\" film. It is a very odd and unique film in terms of being classified as a fantasy, action film that is loosely based on ancient history. It falls in a category between epics with some historical significance such as \\"Gladiator\\" & \\"Braveheart\\" on one side and pure fantasy epics such as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy on the other. Historically, one of the main reasons why the much larger Persian army were having so much trouble fighting the 300-man Spartan army was the fighting style besides the use of the narrow canyons to favor Sparta. The Persian army wasn't always well equipped to do close man-to-man combat. The Persian army was better equipped for speed and fast attacks where they can use there enormous numbers to overwhelm enemies. The 300 Spartan army were better equipped for closer man-to-man combat due to their metal shields, metal helmets and metal armor. However the films' creators found it more appealing to have the Spartans walk around bare-chested with super abs and speedos rather than wear chest armor. Most of the Persians did not wear heavy armor and had shields made of weaved leather. The Spartans favored to fight armies head on while the Persians liked to use archers from distant ranges to compliment their attacks which the Spartans disliked as cowardice as depicted in the film. Putting any historical inaccuracies aside, I think the film was still very enjoyable with all of its visual splendor and over the top mythological villains. I liked the \\"washed out\\" colors look with some touches of red as contrast colors. I wasn't really much of a big fan of \\"Sin City\\", but I think the unique look works really well and better in \\"300\\" instead of \\"Sin City\\".<br />  As far as the DVD release is concerned, it's an adequate two-disc release, but I think the special features definitely could have been better as indicated by many other reviewers. The separate DVD release of the History Channel's \\"The Last Stand of the 300\\" is an excellent documentary and I think it would have been much better if it was included in the \\"300\\" DVD two-disc special edition.  However now-a-days the way DVD manufacturers are cranking different DVD releases of the same movie, it wouldn't surprise me if that down the road we will see an ultimate edition, director's cut or some other type of super-duper edition of \\"300\\" with the History Channel's \\"Last Stand of the 300\\" included. For now, I purchased the exclusive Best Buy box set of \\"300\\" complete with a collectable helmet and art cards which are very cool to have.

0316067598|1.0|Pure sophmoric writting. I would be ashamed to have been associated with this garbage.  Seals #1, Teaxas #1, me #1...Blah, blah, blah yadda yadda yadda.  The fact that men died for a group of SEALS who were in way over thier head from the get go is reprehensible.  Command should have been held accountable for the deaths involved in this FIASCO and court martials and prison sentences should have been the end result.  And if I hear one more story of how SEAL (arp,arp) trainees get wet and sandy and how that is suppossed to make men out of them I am going to scream.  Question...Why was a small group of SEALS (arp, arp) placed in a situation where a company of Rangers or the 10th Mtn Div. should have been???
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Are all of you people brain dead, or what?.. This had to be the dumbest movie I've seen in quite a while..    My favorite \\"laugh out loud\\" moment?.. When Guy Pierce comes into the hotel lobby and a car drives by, blaring it's horn, which makes Pierce jolt to look at the car, and of course he loses his memory.. Then he turns to the clerk and says..    \\"I don't know if I told you this, but I have a bit of a memory problem\\"..    How, exactly, Mr Pierce, can you remember you have a memory problem, when you have said memory problem?..    LOL.. I'm sorry, but I don't have an IQ that hovers around 95..

B000J103WK|5.0|This DVD has got to be one of the best concert DVDs I have ever listened to.  The Eagles were at their prime in Australia!  I am not their biggest fan, I prefer hard rock/heavy metal, but wow, I enjoyed this one!  The guys may be pushing 60, but musically they are at their best!  I sat, listened and watched with enthusiam.  It was one DVD that I could enjoy with my husband, who totally likes different music than I.  I truly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good concert.  Buy it!
0316067598|5.0|Like so many others who have written reviews, this book moved both my husband and me to tears at times.  Enough already of all the P(olitically) C(orrect) garbage we go through in hopes of getting the approval of other nations.  The ROE are putting our military at high risk--it's ridiculous!  Thank you Marcus for your patriotism and for telling this story; all of you are in our prayers.  Glad Laura Ingraham had you on her show to tell your story.  READ THE BOOK, AND ENCOURAGE EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO READ THE BOOK!!!!!
B000RJO578|4.0|This movie is great fun! A total spoof of every cliche cop movie ever made.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are wonderful as the law enforcers.Although the box says hilarious I wouldn't go that far.Yes its funny but I didn't find myself slapping my knee.Shaun of the Dead is funnier! That's just my opinion and both films aregreat.Peter Jackson has a flash of a scene and so does Bill Nigty.
B000I5YCCO|3.0|Taylor Swift's album is for the most part very consistently well-designed for a young teen audience.  Her voice is soft and her songs for the most part blend into each other, good background music. Two standouts for crowd appeal are \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" and \\"Picture to Burn\\".  What's most frustrating for me as a parent are the lyrics to \\"Picture to Burn\\".  She says that her guy friend call tell all his friends that she's obsessive, but that's okay, she'll tell all her friends that he's \\"gay\\".  What is the point of this? Is this a song well-suited for radio play or concert performance?  She is at risk of alienating part of her fan base.  This is my second review. My first seems to have disappeared. I can only comment as a mother of an 11-year-old that I find this reference in her song offensive and unnecessary. I asked another mother if she had heard these lyrics since her daughter listens to this album, and she said that she hadn't picked up on this.  To top this off, I want to add that I since viewed Taylor Swift on the finale show of \\"America's Got Talent\\" performing a duet of \\"Teardrops on my Guitar\\" with finalist Julienne Irwin.  Without studio production finishing touches, Taylor clearly came off as unpolished singing her own song when she sang side by side with 14-year-old Julienne.  Taylor's voice was soft, twangy, and undeveloped with poor breath control.    Here's hoping that she looks to improve her self-image and performance skills and doesn't let platinum album status go to her head.    Added December 2009 - Taylor Swift is turning out to be quite an impressive young woman.  I am hoping that her \\"gay\\" reference was a misstep as an inexperienced performer.  I like most of her songs and I am a 40-something-year-old woman.  I like all of her recent music.

0143038419|2.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is only about a tenth as funny as she thinks she is. Her story is only about a tenth as interesting as it could have been.     Her writing reminded me of those people who speak really loudly and simply to non-English speakers. This book almost literally hurt my ears and made me vaguely embarrassed for its author, who is making quite a spectacle for no good reason.
B00005JPRT|4.0|You've seen the story line in other reviews. The movie will tell you that. What I hope to do is to motivate you to see this well done film. I've seen recent movies that were cute but unaffecting. This one is believable and you will feel it. Once in a while a movie comes along that changes your perspective. Once is that kind of film. Anyone who has ever been interested in making a recording, or falling in love will appreciate this film. It is touching and very real from the poverty of the main characters to the graininess of the film and the roughness of the music. I have to say I wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack before I watched the film but now it's a must-have. It's like remembering a love story to listen to it. Everyone will find something to identify with. The beginning was a little difficult due to some strong accents (maybe some subtitles would help) but that is really my only criticism. Love was real: Once.

B000QUCNOK|3.0|This movie was mezmerizing--it kept my attention throughout.  I don't know why and I find this disturbing.  I detested Pan's Labyrinth and, try as I might, I could not understand the fascination others seemed to have with it and this disturbed me.  I find myself being equally, if not MORE, disturbed that I found Perfume so engrossing.  The beginning which details Grenouille's birth is totally nauseating--the sights are unbearably nasty and sickening, especially the newborn amid the dead fish and maggots and the adult projectile vomiting against the wall, with just a glimpse of the dog that you know is going to devour the vomit.  That said, it is still mezmerizing and morbidly, very morbidly fascinating.  the hero or villan, however you see him, is totally without feeling.  Dustin Hoffman was miscast and the ending (no spoiler here) trashed it all.  It did not at all fit in with the rest of the movie.  I still give it three stars and I am still disturbed as to why I give it any at all.
0316067598|5.0|This is a heartbreaking true story of American heroism.  Even the vaunted SEALs can be the victims of tragic circumstances that test their resolve.  Although tempted beyond the human capacity to endure, this group of heroes chose compassion over military expediency and paid the ultimate price.      This true story is also recounted in a compelling adventure novel: [[ASIN:1602900507 The Y Factor]]
006085412X|5.0|Our 20 month old son calls this the \\"Brother Book\\" and goes and gets it off the shelf for us to read it to him.  As most of the reviews already say, this is a sweet book with a friendly approach to the impending life change.  We have made all of the characters into ourselves, calling the boy in the book by our son's name.  I also show him pictures of myself pregnant with him and then what he looked like after he was born and I think that between the book and the photos our son is beginning to understand that there is a new baby on the way.  Certainly that something is going on in my tummy.    I was surprised by how big this book is (about 15\\" tall).  I expected something smaller. Also, we never actually get to the end of the book as we get hung up on the ice cream at the park and get sidetracked to the freezer for ice.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|When I began reading the reviews universally praising these videos as the best nature documentary ever produced, I knew that I absolutely had to have it. Nature shows look positively stunning in High Def, so getting the pinnacle in the genre was a no-brainer. (And I agree with those who put this series at the top.) Also a good move was purchasing the HD DVD version of Planet Earth. While it can be a bit pricey, a diligent hunt should enable one to procure a HD set at a good price. If you have a good High Def TV and a HD DVD player and want to show off to your friends and neighbors, popping in one of the discs in this set will do it. They will be impressed with it and with you.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Diana Krall's \\"The Look of Love\\" is so conventional an album, as far from pushing any musical boundary whatsoever as you can imagine -- and yet it is unmistakably recognizable and even as unique as you can get. Indeed, while until 1999 her albums featured just her trio (vocals, piano, guitar and bass), the follow up \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" added a half of elegant Johnny Mandel arrangements -- and the result was one perfectly balanced album, still Diana's best as regards standard songs. The mini-evolution continued (boosted by the great commercial success) and the resulting \\"The Look of Love\\" became the orchestral antidote to trio albums \\"Love Scenes\\" and \\"All for You\\".     Critically accepted with almost unanimous cold shoulders, it's a bit vain and indulgent affair, however, for many of us out there it's a favorite good-taste guilty pleasure. Claus Ogerman (Sinatra and Jobim) arrangements are beautiful, just breathtaking are the final parts of \\"Love Letters\\" and \\"Dancing in the Dark\\", Al Schmitt's sound is once again immaculate and with the standard songs -- either bossa nova's or ballads -- like these you can never go wrong. And beware -- an album like this will never be repeated. This is a once-in-a lifetime stuff. If Krall made \\"The Look of Love Vol. 2\\", it would be downright boring. This time, she's forgiven with a smile. Released in the fear-stricken fall of 2001, it will also remain a testimony of what soothing music many North Americans listened to on those days.

B0001I561E|5.0|We literally wore out 3 Disney VHS editions of this film before it was released on DVD. Now several years later, our youngster watches this film just as much as ever and we enjoy seeing it with him: OVER & OVER & OVER!!    SOUNDS GREAT - LOOKS GREAT & IT'S GOT ROBIN WILLIAMS & AN EXCITING PLOT TOO!    IN A NUTSHELL: A WHOLE NEW WORLD & IT INCLUDES ROBIN WILLIAMS AS THE GENIE     This DVD release of 'Aladdin' by Disney is a treat for audiences regardless of age. It is one of the few films I can think of that both children and their parents may equally enjoy, and this Platinum Edition DVD is the best way I know to bring Aladdin into our homes.     WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: BOY MEETS GIRL - BOY MUST BE WORTHY OF GIRL ON HIS OWN MERITS!     Jasmine is 'PRINCESS JASMINE' and she must be married to a prince before her 18th birthday, which is in three days, as the film opens. Needless to say, she is less than excited by the suitors who have presented to claim her. \\"Another Stuffed Shirt - Swaggering Peacock\\", to use her words. After deciding to runaway - without planning for any expenses or anything for that matter - she runs into Aladdin during a street market fracas caused by her lack of currency, and is saved by Aladdin from the knife point of a greedy merchant. Thinking that Jasmine was just an ordinary girl, Aladdin set his sights on her, but found it was necessary to flee from the palace guards several times with Jasmine in tow. Aladdin discovers to his chagrin, as Jasmine declares her identity to the palace guards, that she is no ordinary girl, which puts her out of Aladdin's reach.     BUT THIS IS ONLY WHERE THE STORY BEGINS: ALADDIN: \\"THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH\\"     Believe it or not, the film goes along happily for over 40 minutes before Robin Williams makes his entrance as the Genie. By this time we know that Aladdin must elevate his station to attain the hand of 'Princess Jasmine' - but how?     A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE! BUT PRINCE ALI?     Acquiring theservices of the Genie for three wishes has made it possible for Aladdin to elevate his station rather profoundly by simply wishing for it. So Prince Ali is born, along with a terrific song, lyrics and video action. Unfortunately, wishing does not make one different on the inside, and this Prince Ali charade is doomed from the start. But ---- Aladdin will elevate himself and redeem the trust which Princess Jasmine was beginning to place in him, on his own merit.     THERE IS STILL MORE--LOTS MORE: ONE CAN'T JUST WISH FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT-ASK ALADDIN     This film has a lovely story and wonderful animation, but it also has Robin Williams who gives a truly over-the-top performance as the Genie. He is the Genie and is so quick and witty and glib that audiences, regardless of age, will really zone in on his delivery. His role clearly demonstrates that one cannot simply change or improve oneself by simply wishing for it. This type of change and improvement comes from within and we go back to the theme 'the diamond in the rough'.     No decent hero can be much of a hero without a fiendish and sly villain over whom to prevail. 'Jafar' and his evil sidekick 'Iago' provide the needed balance to present Aladdin with a real obstacle. Jafar readily grabs at the chance to elevate his standing by wishing for it, and first wishes to be the Sultan, then the \\"most powerful sorcerer in the world\\" and ultimately the \\"all-powerful genie\\". This leads him down the path that Aladdin did not take and we get to see exactly what Jafar reaps in the end, which demonstrates that the only way to improve oneself is by exerting an honest effort, not just wishing for it.     IN THE END: WE GET BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN - \\"A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE\\"     Aladdin must defeat Jafar on his own and in so doing may redeem himself fully in the eyes of Jasmine and her father, the Sultan.         *-----> THE CAST [voices] <-----*     Scott Weinger - Aladdin [Voice]   Brad Kane - Aladdin Singing [Voice]   Robin Williams - Genie [Voice]   Lea Salonga - Singing Jasmine [Voice]   Linda Larkin - Jasmine [Voice]   John Freeman - Jafar [Voice]   Frank Welker - Abu [Voice]   Gilbert Gottfried - Iago [Voice]   Douglas Seale - Sultan [Voice]       *-----> THE PRODUCTION CREW <-----*     Ron Clements - Director / Producer / Screenwriter   John Musker - Director / Producer / Screenwriter   Ted Elliott - Screenwriter   Terry Rossio - Screenwriter   Howard Ashman - Songwriter   Alan Menken - Composer (Music Score)   Tim Rice - Songwriter       SPECIAL FEATURES ON DVD:     *---> DVD Features: [Including abridged promotional material]     --->Available Subtitles: English, Spanish, French     ---> Available Audio Tracks: English, English, French, Spanish     ---> Commentary by: the filmmakers & the animators     ---> Restored and enhanced digital transfer with an all-new 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix     ---> \\"A Diamond In The Rough: The Making Of ALADDIN\\" -- new documentary   Deleted Song \\"Proud Of Your Boy\\" -- One of the lost gems by Academy-Award winning songwriting team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken     ---> Clay Aiken Performs \\"Proud Of Your Boy\\" -- This all-new recording is accompanied by both the original storyboards and an all-new music video with footage from the recording studio     ---> Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey Performs \\"A Whole New World\\" in an All-New Music Video     ---> Alan Menken: Musical Renaissance Man     ---> Deleted Scenes & Songs     ---> Disney's Virtual DVD Ride: ALADDIN's Magic Carpet Adventure     ---> The Art Of ALADDIN + 3 Wishes Game + Inside The Genie's Lamp & Never-Before Seen 3-D Tour + The Genie World Tour -- A hilarious trip around the world with the genie     ---> Pop-Up Fun Facts -- Watch the film in this special \\"trivia mode\\" feature       SUMMED-UP: VERY COMPELLING VISUAL EXPERIENCE PLUS A WONDERFUL STORY LINE     This is a truly wonderful animated family classic to enjoy watching again and again.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I've been a fan of Incubus for about seven years, have seen them live four (soon to be five) times, and have listened to their albums countless times. Morning View remains my all-time favorite Incubus album, despite some \\"old-school\\" fans' opinion that this album, and the two that have followed, represent Incubus' \\"sell-out\\" to \\"mainstream\\" or \\"radio\\" rock (I must say, also, that the rock radio station in Miami still only plays \\"Drive\\" and no other Incubus songs). Let's not forget that several of Incubus' hits came from the album Make Yourself: \\"Pardon Me,\\" \\"Stellar,\\" \\"Drive.\\" Certainly Morning View represents a departure from the days of S.C.I.E.N.C.E., but Incubus has always said they want each album to represent an evolution in their sound, and I feel that true fans can appreciate all phases of Incubus' career.<br /><br />Another criticism of Morning View is that it's too mellow, too \\"chill.\\" This quality, though, is really appealing to me. Although some of the songs are more \\"chill\\" than those on Make Yourself (which, I might add, contains the extremely mellow \\"I Miss You\\") or S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Morning View contains more of those sweeping, almost epic, moody, dramatic compositions that are my favorite Incubus songs. Tracks like \\"Here in My Room\\" and \\"Monuments and Melodies,\\" both of which were produced after Morning View's release, retain some of that drama, but Morning View the album on which Incubus is at its moody best. That's why I love it!<br /><br />\\"Nice to Know You\\" - This is a great rock song, but because it's Incubus, it has a little extra. \\"NTKY\\" is also amazing to hear live.<br />\\"Circles\\" - Another great rocker, and like most Incubus tunes, it has more thoughtful (although Brandon Boyd is as enigmatic as he is thoughtful) lyrics than the majority of rock music out there today.<br />\\"Wish You Were Here\\" - The music in this song is all drama, and you can't help but sing along. Gotta love, \\"I'm counting UFOs/I signal them with my lighter/And in this moment I am happy.\\"<br />\\"Just a Phase\\" - Extremely moody, beautiful music, and Brandon Boyd can really get emotion across with his voice. This song has great build-up and then just explodes at the end.<br />\\"11 am\\" - My favorite song on the album. Again, you can feel the pain and frustation not only in the lyrics but in the voice.<br />\\"Blood on the Ground\\" - This song rocks, and I love the lyrics.<br />\\"Mexico\\" - I have to admit, this isn't the most exciting song because it's just an acoustic guitar and Brandon singing, but it's really emotional and, again, super moody.<br />\\"Warning\\" - This song has moments of that quasi-epic quality I like about Incubus, but it's also just a quality rock song with mainstream appeal.<br />\\"Echo\\" - This is a beautiful song that makes me feel really happy to be in love.<br />\\"Have You Ever\\" - Another rocker, but not my favorite on the album.<br />\\"Are You In\\" - A contagious party anthem. It's kind of out of place on the album, but it's fun.<br />\\"Under My Umbrella\\" - This song has some really interesting music and is one of the hardest songs on the album. One of my faves and an interesting balance to some of the softer, more mellow sounds that characterize Morning View.<br />\\"Aqueous Transmission\\" - This song is the epitome of chill. Even when I think I don't like this song that much, I listen to it and love it. Incubus experiments here with some different interests and comes up with a cool sound.a Phase\\" - Extremely moody, beautiful music, and Brandon Boyd can really get emotion across with his voice.

076531178X|5.0|I have now read Mistborn twice, but have three copies of it (2 hardcover one paperback).  I found that after reading the book the first time, I couldn't help but immediately recommending it to friends and family who like fantasy (and even a few who don't).  My copy got passed around from person to person, each one enjoying it thoroughly.  I've yet to have someone read the book who didn't love it, and go on to read [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]] as well. I bought other copies so that I could have one to read again, but immediately started passing those around as well.    I'm not sure I could add much more than what hasn't already been said about this book.  If you are looking for a well written book, with interesting characters, fun action scenes and an exciting plot, then pick this up.      I'll say the same thing here that I told each of the people I lent my copies out to.  If you read to the scene that starts on page 87 (Hardcover edition), then you will finish the book. Most people fell in love with the book even before that part, but if you aren't already hooked by that point, you will be after reading it.     There are no books I recommend more than this.  5 stars is simply not enough.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Karen (Emma Thompson) is a best selling cult novelist like Anne Tyler or someone who's famous for the consistency with which her main characters meet fate, for all of them die.  No exceptions.<br /><br />When Harold Crick figures out that he's one of her characters, with the help of humanist Dustin Hoffman, he gets upset, naturally enough, and attempts to break down the fortress of solitude Karen Eiffel's erected around herself.<br /><br />I found some of the characters unconvincing.  Queen Latifah must haveread the script, discovered she wasn't playing anything real, and just decided to look elegant and demure, playing a life-coach type of woman whom Karen hires to help her work through her writers' block.  Latifah can be good when the script give her something to do, but here, she's just something for Thompson to bounce off of.<br /><br />Kind of the same thing for Maggie Gyllenhall, who was just there to soften up uptight Will Ferrell--that is her total function in the movie, the conventional \\"love interest.\\"  But she makes the most of it and reportedly went to a crash course seven week course in pastry making at France's Cordon Bleu, and throughout the movie you see her energetically ignoring the script and baking a carload of pastries, brioches, cookies and strudel.  Good for her!<br /><br />Regarding the ending of the movie, I, a novelist myself, have often wondered if it would have made a difference if the screenwrifers had set up more romantic/sexual tension between Emma Thompson and Will Ferrell.  The way it is, there's nothing there, but I would have liked to see them get involved, maybe go to Club Med, get Karen out of that pretentious, chichi empty cold Manhattan apartment, and give her some laughs.  And instead of Maggie Gyllenhall opposing this development, she could be welcoming, reassuring, teaching Emma Thompson that baking is the next best thing to godliness.  You know, light a match under her, the way Gregory Peck gets princess Audrey Hepburn to act like a girl in ROMAN HOLIDAY by appealing to the romantic in her.by appealing to the romantic in her.
0694003611|5.0|I give this book five stars vicariously because my son can't type yet.  He regularly selects it from among several choices.  It seems a bit odd to me that it points out kittens playing on the floor, but refers to a Harvey size rabbit in a rocking chair as an old lady.  But it grabs my son's interest and that's what it's all about.....isn't it?
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Like many people, my primary exposure to the Alan Parsons Project had been strictly their top 40 hits.  Shortly after the release of \\"Eye in the Sky\\", I was reassigned to an Air Force base in Korea (early 80's).  While there, one of the friends I made was a huge Alan Parsons fan and had all of their albums.  I borrowed and listened to them all over time, but it was this one, \\"I Robot\\", which I found to be a masterpiece.  Although all of the Parsons Project albums are concept albums, this one is the ultimate concept album.  Most people are familiar with the radio hit \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\", but that is just one good song on an album filled with great music, that just seems to naturally flow together in the order in which it is presented.  \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" is one of the most stunningly beautiful songs ever recorded by anyone.  \\"Some Other Time\\" is good enough to have been a hit single.  The production and musicianship are incredible.  This is prog-rock at its absolute best.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|Whenever a new female singer-songwriter who plays piano comes along, also comes the instant comparisons to the like of Fiona Apple and Norah Jones, even if the only thing they have in common is they are females who just happen to play the piano. And so you may here the same comparisons for the latest pianist on the block Sara Bareilles. Sure you can here the other artist named throughout her debut album Little Voice, true be told, Sara is not as moody as Fiona nor as mellow as Jones.    Don't compare her to Vanessa Carlton either because unlike the classically trained artist, Bareilles had no formal training on the instrument. But on listen to album and you find she didn't need any. Little Voice is full of accessible pop songs that will undoubtedly show up on cheesy medical dramas when their writers are too lazy to write a couple more pages of dialogue and instead choose to close out an episode with yet another lengthy musical montage.    The album starts off the bouncing ditty Love Song, a refreshing kiss off to a guy who requested one but doesn't come off as annoyingly bitter like other artists who recently made a bad decision to write their own songs, while Bottle it Up takes a slower bounce to slightly better effect. On the other hand Vegas is a smooth track that would play very well if you were to take a late night road trip to the Strip. The song would also play well, much like Love on the Rock, in a smoke lounge just off the Strip. Fairytale whimsically re-imagines different princesses from children's tale that didn't live happily ever after. The album concludes with the beautiful Gravity, a simplistic song about always going back to the guy whom she begs for him to let her go.    Even though Little Voices is loaded front to back with a bunch of good pop songs, the album is missing that one hit single that would make a big slash at radio much like Anna Nalick had with Breathe (2 AM) that kept her on the airwaves over a year. But that doesn't mean you should check her out know so you can say you knew her way back when she finally gets the inevitable hit single.
B00007KWHN|5.0|After hearing the single version of \\"Your Move\\" on a local FM station in California in the early 70's, I decided to give this album a try.  I went to a local record shop, owned by a British guy, who had the habit of opening some new albums and having them available for customers to listen to.  Obviously, this was very unusual in the days of vinyl records, but they were usually albums he intended to keep for his own personal collection.  Of course, he only did this with certain albums.  As luck would have it, \\"The Yes Album\\" was one he had opened.  What can I possibly say to convey just how good this album is.  After hearing \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\" and \\"Starship Trooper\\", I immedicately purchased the album.  Yes have their own distinctive, magnificent sound, with tremendous musicianship and great original songs.  It was like nothing I had ever heard before with the soaring organ and masterful guitar work.  While the band would go on to make other classic albums, notably \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\", this one remains my personal favorite of their's.
B000RIHBIE|2.0|There are some bands that would be better off as one hit wonders. Most notable the Bloodhound Gang fits this category. Fire, Water, Burn would have fit pretty well into the moniker one hit wonder with its suburb rap and hilarious way they bleeped out the naughty words. Then years later the group just had to have another hit with The Bad Touch forever diminishing Fire, Water, Burn by knocking it out of the realm of one hit wonderdom because, really, who cares about two hit wonders? But keep in mind sometime history distorts hits as Vanilla Ice is routinely considered a one hit wonder even though Play that Funky Music was almost as big as Ice Ice Baby at that time.    Along those lines of bands that would be better off as a one hit wonder is Sum 41. Fatlip was catchy as the first rap-rock hybrid sifted through the pseudo-punk filter. But when the band should have been resting on their laurels, they instead kept at it churning out fifth rate Green Day knock-offs. That continues on their fifth studio album Underclass Hero (not to be confused with the John Lennon song Working Class Hero recently covered by Green Day).    Taking the Green Day route even further, they are now a trio (did anyone else notice they were down a member) going for a more political writing style. This is no more present than on March of the Dogs which starts off by announcing the president of the Unites States is dead. Yawn. Do we really need political commentary by a bunch of Canadians one of which who has Paris Hilton as one of the notches on his bedpost? Well we need it about as much as a love song about that same dude (see Avril Lavigne's When You're Gone) or a power balled about Avril Lavine (see Sum 41's With Me).    The only interesting songs here is when the band gets away from Green Day lineage and sounding like ninety percent of the bands that have ever showed up at the Warped Tour like on the short, as in under a minute, French Ma Poubelle. Or on So Long, Goodbye where the band sounds like it is trying to recreate Wonderwall to a slower beat. Granted it ends up like sounding like a mash-up between the Oasis classic and Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).
B0000020T3|5.0|I first got into the Flamin' Groovies in the late 60's, when I heard their first album \\"Supersnazz\\".  Guitarist Cyril Jordan and singer/writer Roy Loney seemed to compliment each other perfectly, which was the drive behind this excellent rock band.  Despite putting out 3 quality albums (\\"Flamingo\\" and \\"Teenage Head\\" being the other two), sales were poor and the band received little recognition in the U.S., although they were pretty popular in Europe.  Following \\"Teenage Head\\", Loney left the band over differences with Jordan and Jordan subsequently moved the band to Europe, where they lingered in obscurity for several years.<br />After hooking up with Dave Edmunds, the band released \\"Shake Some Action\\" in 1976.  Complete with ringing guitars and Edmund's bass-heavy production, the quality of this album is simply superb.  From start to finish there is not a bad song on this album.  Amazingly, nearly every song sounds like it must have been a hit record during the British Invasion era.  It was a complete anachronism in the mid-70's, but it sounded fresh and lively and it worked.

B00004XSUW|5.0|When I first heard Taj Mahal's debut album in the late 60's, I was simply astounded at the sheer quality of this music.  There is not one bit of filler on this album, which remains an incredible listen nearly 40 years later.  This album, more than any other album I ever bought, had the biggest influence of my life.  Prior to this album, I had never been into pure blues.  But, this album changed that forever, as I now have a personal music library filled with dozens and dozens of great blues albums.  Backed by some great musicians, including guitarists, Ry Cooder and Jesse Ed Davis, this album never lets up, from the opening song \\"Leaving Truck\\" to the closing number \\"The Celebrated Walkin' Blues\\".  This album changed my musical horizons and remains one of my most treasured albums.  Taj Mahal made a lot of great albums, but he never made one better than this.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to The Order of the Phoenix music over and over. Even before seeing the movie, and just hearing parts of the music on the Harry Potter web site, I was enchanted by it. The music is very enjoyable to listen to. I am a John Williams fan, but am very pleased with this music composed by Nicholas Hooper. It is as captivating as the first Harry Potter CD by John Williams.

0385333846|4.0|This was my first read of Vonnegut. I had heard much about this novel, and finally got around to reading it. His book seems to go out of its way to display the fractured and dissembled nature that war brings to individuals. Billy Pilgrim's chaotic and disorganized state of going from one place to the next is a testament to how control is seriously lacking in war times. Billy experiences this in many different times and transformations, as he travels back in time to the war, then reverts even further back, and then finally to his time after the bombing of Dresden. The insanity of war is akin to Billy's losing touch at many points; the horrific massacre at Dresden is the reference point for this madness. Still, as we look at the book from the point of view of Billy, by novel's end, we realize that he is just one example.     As many others have alluded to, Slaughter House Five takes a very serious subject, with disturbing images and negative aspects, and seems to make them matter-of-fact and nondescript. The understated tone, such as using the phrase \\"So it goes\\" every time death is mentioned, makes for black humor. In a way the entire book can be considered an oxymoron, as much of what Billy experiences (comrades dying, his wife's accident, being taken prisoner by aliens from Tralfamadore, having to dig through corpses) is written in a comically tragic way.     There also seems to be a point made about humanity's lack of control in events. Lack of control is a constant theme in the novel. At one point, Billy questions one of the Tralfamadorians about the violent ways of humans; their response is to imply that it is a silly question because there is nothing anyone can do about it, even if it is a future event. Billy seems to also become frustrated with the various haphazard leaps in time, to which he has no control. Ironically, much of what is taking place in the \\"real world\\" is also uncontrollable. Fate seems to rule all, even though this seems to be an illogical excuse for events. Free will becomes an illusion.     In this way, appearance and reality are mixed up. Perhaps this is why Vonnegut begins the novel, \\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.\\" There is an understated explanation for the course of events, despite the fact that many of them are true and seem real. Despite what we think of whether Billy is completely crazy, there is much reality to what he goes through. Vonnegut is a master at making a satire of these experiences. Clearly his intent was to make a statement about the effects war has on individuals.     As far as reading goes, this was a quick read because it is quite original and unique. At times, it can be strangely disjointed, which may make it hard to follow; I found myself wanting to go back and try to figure out where he was going. Still, it is entertaining. I'm not sure I'd just recommend this to anyone, but if you like dark humor, then this is probably the way to go.
B000QZZGTY|4.0|Its hard to imagine what people were expecting when this movie had its initial release, or what they thought when the final reel ended. Its a tough movie to watch- even today. Anybody unfamiliar with De Sade should be warned- this is not erotica, there are no sex scenes in this movie to deliberately arouse the viewer, no characters, save for the victims, with whom we, as viewers or indeed voyeurs, can empathise in anyway. The directors brief introduction(Or introductory brief) is pretty helpful. This is a movie about persecution, about power and corruption. Even though it presents the merest glimpse into the volumous, unfinished novel upon which it is very closely based, its still almost too much. There is very little to enjoy about this movie in the normal kind of way and at its conclusion one is relieved that it is over but its begs the question - is it art? Certainly there is enough suffering to lend it that status - in the same manner that Picasso's nightmarish Guernica is art - a reminder of what true horror humans are capable of..  For the casual movie goer this probably won't be quite what you're looking for. Its too static and the pace is decidedly and deliberately funereal, there are very few sets and its ending will leave you wondering what the hell just happened?  A word on the disc.  The transfer is good, the sound quality is clear and sharp, the picture itself is good and crisp with little distortion or blurring. The subtitles are very readible although there was one moment when the titling lasted for just over a second and I had to spin back and pause to read them. Theres precious little else on the disc save the aforementioned directors introductory brief read by an actor and another simple filmography. Anyone familiar with Pasolini will probably know that stuff already.  Just having the movie is enough

B000OQF6N6|5.0|I seen a lot of mixed reviews about this album and Corgan just using the pumpkin name to make a buck. The truth of the matter is, Corgan IS the Smashing Pumpkins.  If you didn't think so the first time, listen to the disc again.  I could here all of my favorite remnants from Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie.  Personally, I never listened to the Pumpkins for James Iha or D'arcy. I was more enchanted by the way Corgan's voice seemed to melt into the sound of the electric guitar.  There are an infinite number of bands that change members time and time again.    Hands down, this albums rocks. It's poetic, heavy, light, dark, gray, brooding, shrill, pumpkiny! Enjoy! May you be as nostalgic as I was.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game follows the exploits of a born leader and strategist, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, from his drafting into an elite military school, all the way up to his graduation from the ultra-elite command school. It is a quick read and pretty hard to put down. The pace is fast and intense from start to finish. Ender must fight his way through all of the obstacles laid out before him in order to fulfill his true potential as the prodigious savior that all of the adults in the military expect him to be. Colonel Graff is the head of the military school and the mastermind behind Ender's trials and often goes against his better judgment to push Ender to his limits. All of this for the upcoming war with the \\"buggers,\\" who the humans will surely face for a third time.<br /><br />Now, I do have a few small problems with the book. Ender is completely infallible from start to finish in his capacity as a military mastermind. Even at 6, he is heads and tails above even the smartest kids in the school, and they are all presented as exceptional. From start to finish, he takes on all comers with nary an outward blip. It is fun to read about this little upstart making everybody else look stupid but ,very early on, the reader has little doubt and this removes the element of surprise a bit and, in turn, doubt about the outcome. Because of Ender's perfection, not much happens that doesn't seem inevitable. Where Card does seem to insert doubt is into the main character's own mind and, even as a prodigy, Ender seems too adult like in his thought process and angst. I could be completely wrong, but I was not convinced Ender was as young as he was through most of the book. Sure, Card tried to use immature banter between the children, but it just didn't offset the material going through Ender's head and the language was just an odd foil. These kids are so super intelligent and have complex inner lives, but are calling each other \\"fart faces.\\"<br /><br />My quibbles though, by no means are to discourage anyone from reading Ender's Game... Just a selfish little wish list to have made the book that much better for me personally.from reading Ender's Game...

B00006AW2G|5.0|One of the Stones' best album/cd's.  It was great music when it first came out and still is.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to hear the Stones at their best.
0143038419|3.0|I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Two of my girlfriends raved about the book so I bought it at the airport.  I was not that amused or intrigued.  The first part (eating) dragged on and on about her mental state, acrimonious divorce, obsession over some guy....YAWN...and the secdon part was in India where people actually pay good money to live in the Ashram and self-deprivation.  (yes, I am totally shallow)  The 3rd part was interesting b/c it talked a great deal about the culture and brought an eyewitness view of Bali to the reader. Granted, Liz Gilbert is an excellent writer and I enjoyed most of her descriptions, but talk about a woman with way too many neuroses.  I got tired of all her crying jags and self-pity.  I will, however, eat in Naples at the pizzeria.
B000000W5N|5.0|I had this also when it first came out and like it better as a cd than an album.  The recordings don't deteriorate on a cd like they do on an album.  It is one of the Stones best albums/cds.  I recommend this cd plus Let It Bleed and Beggars Banquet if you want the best of the Stones music.
0425188809|3.0|After reading the reviews for this book, I was expecting to be blown away.  While I enjoyed the book, I wouldn't call it one of Koontz's best.  It had good characters, an interesting plot and it was well paced.  Here are a few things that I didn't like:    **SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT!!**      + Nora progessed socially way to fast, and then didn't even show a hint of regression at any point.  The fast progession is much more acceptable than the lack of regression.  Honestly, I would have been happy if, even for just a paragraph, Nora slipped into her old hermit-like ways and needed to be brought out of her shell again.  + Lem and Cliff (I think those were their names).  That whole side story bored me to tears.  I know it was an important element in the story, but it just didn't do it for me.  + Einstein should have done more with the Scrabble pieces!  \\"Can I have some hamburger? Or three Weenies?\\" and \\"Home is where the weenies are.\\" were classic and hysterical lines.  I wish Koontz had stuck in a few more lines like that.  + I thought Vince's death was anticlimactic.  As I came to the end of the novel, I was hoping for one of two things with Vince.  I was hoping that either he would somehow be linked to The Outsider, or I was hoping that The Outsider would kill him.   Honestly, Vince had been hunting Nora and Travis for the entire book, and when he finally gets to them, he's dead maybe fifteen, twenty minutes later.  I was expecting a bit more.    So that this review isn't all negative, here are a few things I loved about the book:  + Einstein and the Scrabble pieces.  Although I did state earlier that I wish he had done more with them, what's written is classic.  + Nora's backstory, Travis' backstory and how the two met.  + The Outsider.  Although part of me wishes that we had seen him and gotten to know him more, the fact that we never really understand him makes him a more mysterious and scary character.  + I loved the relationship established between Jim Keene and the main characters.  + Garrison Dilworth.  What a wonderful, exciting character.    And so, to sum it all up, I wouldn't call this book \\"amazing\\" or \\"excellent\\".  I'd probably put it a touch above \\"good\\".  In my opinion, it's definately worth reading.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is a favorite Rollings Stones album/cd of mine.  I had the album in the past and the cd sounds even better.  Excellent music.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002ZYE1Y Once]] This is my favorite album by Nightwish. Excellent music by Finland's symphonic metal band, Nightwish. Living in the U.S. we are not exposed to many of Europe's best artists and musicians. Don't miss this band. You will love them. Even if you are not a heavy metal fan, you will love this music, because it is symphonic metal. That means it's way more than metal guitars, drums and screaming vocals. Tarja, the female singer, is a trained opera singer. Toumas, the keyboardist, is a musical genius. Toumas writes the music. The bass guitarist, Marco, has what's called a \\"raucous\\" voice, but he is outstanding, and also helps compose some of the music. The lead guitarist, Empu is not only extremely talented, he's gorgeous! The drummer is the best I've ever heard! Check out Nightwish!! You will love them. They're touring the US in the Fall. Look for their new album in September.
B0009QZ4CO|5.0|This 1976 release would prove to be the last truly excellent release by the band.  Although the follow-up album World Record (also 1976) had its moments, it was clear that the steam had run out.  Fortunately, Still Life is a remarkable Van Der Graaf Generator album and features those properties that make them one of my favorite progressive bands: Peter Hammill's voice and vocals; Hugh Banton's organ work; and Guy Evans drumming.  Come to think of it, this may very well be the finest \\"post Pawn Hearts\\" album they released.  That of course is just my opinion.<br /><br />The lineup on Still Life is considered the classic lineup and featured virtuoso drummer Guy Evans (drum kit and percussion); Hugh Banton (Hammond organ; mellotron; acoustic piano; bass pedals; and bass guitar); Peter Hammill (vocals; electric and acoustic guitars; and piano); and David Jackson (alto, tenor, and soprano saxophones (acoustic and electric); and flute).  The playing by all members is in top form on Still Life, although David seemed to have backed off from the wild playing that characterized the 1970-1971 period.  Peter's voice however, is still loaded with the angst and anguish that made him my favorite prog vocalist - he characteristically alternates between a high pitched falsetto and a heavy metal growl.  Although not very high in the mix, Peter plays electric guitar on the album - the liner notes comment on how he felt that he could hold his own on the instrument after releasing several solo albums.  Hugh favors a very clean, \\"churchy\\" tone on the Hammond, which really makes the album work for me.  Guy churns out his usual high quality work on the drum kit and this newly mastered version really brings the intricacies of his playing out.<br /><br />The five tunes on the album range in length from 7:08 to 12:23 and feature the tense arrangements, odd meters, and strange root movements that characterized much of their classic material.  Like all of their best music, there is generally a brooding atmosphere to Still Life, which is saturated with minor keys.  However, like Godbluff (1975), the rough edges appear to have been smoothed away a bit and a little bit more room is left for softer textures and melodies.  The spacey track My Room (Waiting for Wonderland) is a good example of this and boasts a very nice and melodic saxophone solo by David.  One other quiet passage includes the introduction to Childlike Faith in Childhood's End, which features an extremely interesting flute arrangement that does not sound too much unlike the approach used in minimalism.  By the way, this track is a superb symphonic prog workout and an excellent way to close the album.  I guess it is worth pointing out that although there are some smoothed edges and quiet moments, this album \\"rocks\\" - the VDGG heaviness is very much in place along with some metrically complex and blazing ensemble work that kept me on the edge of my seat (La Rossa comes to mind).<br /><br />This remastered album by Virgin is absolutely, positively excellent.  The CD booklet features informative liner notes and the lyrics to each piece.  The sound quality is what blows me away - all of the remastered albums sound so much better than the older versions that these may as well be completely new recordings.  The bonus track includes a scary and overwhelming live version of the previously unreleased track Gog, which was recorded at a concert held in 1975 at the Theatr Gwynedd in Bangor, Wales.  The sound quality is very poor, but the sheer brutal power of the piece more than makes up for it.<br /><br />All in all, this is the last excellent album by VDGG and is very highly recommended along with H to He, He who am the Only One (1970); and Pawn Hearts (1971).re to Still Life, which is saturated with minor keys.

B00005JGAB|1.0|Seriously, every song in this album sounds the same. They can't sing and have managed to figure out one way to express music. By droning out the same, tired guitar sequence while ushering in their strange half talk/half mumble singing style, with lyrics that no one can understand, or would want to. Absolute trash and over hyped garbage.

B000059XUI|2.0|At remember as soon as I finished watching the first Superman movie, I was straight online to get the rest. I ended up buying Superman II, and Superman Returns, but adding Superman III & IV to my wishlist. Thank God I didn't buy the lot. Because that would have been a big mistake.<br /><br />Before people start judging, I have not seen the Richard Donner cut of Superman II. Judging my some reviews, it sounds better, but there's also a lot of reviewers who say this version, directed by David Lester, is great.<br /><br />Obviously we watched a different movie.<br /><br />Superman II just did not live up to expectations for me. Granted, Marlon Brando was no longer in it, instead replacing him with Superman's mother in the scenes, after Brando had a little accident with suing them. Plus, whether it was just me, but the special effects were just not up to par with the first movie. Was it a rush job? Cos I swear I saw strings/wires at one point (and my Dad can confirm that he saw them too, so I know it's not my bad eyesight!), something which I'm normally oblivious to. Also, the back projection was shocking, the outlines were too harsh, and it just stood out so much, rather than being seamless.<br /><br />I grew up watching Lois & Clark: The New Adventures Of Superman on TV, and am currently trying to relive my childhood by getting the DVDs. I have the first two seasons, and it took that long for Lois even begin to think that Clark was Superman, Superman was Clark etc. It took a film and a half for the Margot Kidder Lois to realise Clark was Superman. She then tries to prove it by throwing herself into a river, thinking Clark will don his Superman outfit, and dive in to save her. It's painstakingly obvious that no superhero worth his tights would give away his secret that easily, and instead Clark throws her a branch. The love story does come about a lot quicker in this (but I suppose anything's better than the will they/won't they story of Peter & Mary Jane), with Clark taking off his glasses (woohoo!) and revealing himself to be Superman. And then giving up his powers to be with Lois.<br /><br />Only for the bad supervillians from the first film to reappear, take over Metropolis and have Lex Luthor offer to help them in their quest, if they give him Australia. Of course. But when there's a will, there's a way, and Superman will go on to defeat them, banish them, and be the overall conquering superhero. And be with Lois forever more? Aha.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see the Richard Donner cut of this movie, but before writing this review, I deleted parts III & IV from my wishlist.

B000F6IOC0|2.0|I'm a sucker for sequels and couldn't resist this one and on a rainy afternoon binged with this movie as well as the first, Underworld. Underworld Evolution picks up precisely where Underworld ended and all of the dangling ends finally twine together for an entertaining and dark action film. Action was pretty good (how can you go wrong with werewolves and vampires?) though the plot often seemed to be grasping for something more solid. This was definitely not as good as Underworld but still worth a watch but still mediocre compared to most films in the genre.
B000069HPL|4.0|This is a funny movie...It will keep you laughing, however...watch out for the dirty language...especially in the opening sound track. This is not for young children.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|After my second viewing of this film I figured I'd get around to writing a review. In an our-world noir-esque film, vampires and werewolves are in an age old war to defeat one or the another. The werewolves pursue an age old legend of a wolf and a vampire combining into one species. It's definitely an interesting idea combining two of the best horror species and the movie allows for some definite eye candy moments. The film is shot in a very cold, sterile at times, manner that allows for some grand juxtaposition of some of the film's carnage. A fun film.

There were many attractive guys and a couple of attractive girls but my favorite was the blond, Reid Garwin (or Toby Hemingway in real life). Not only was he cute but I liked his character.<br /><br />The action was decent, some of it looked a little too \\"staged\\" but for the most part, it was fine. The acting was alright too although no one was really outstanding.<br /><br />Here's the story on the back of the DVD: \\"To the students of the Spencer Academy, the Sons of Ipswich are the baddest boys on campus. But that's not all they share. The four friends also share a 300-year-old secret: they're warlocks, the teenage descendants of a 17th-century coven of witches. So when the long-banished fifth son suddenly appears and threatens to kill their loved ones, they realize they must face their enemy in order to prevent him from stealing their powers and shattering THE COVENANT forever.\\"<br /><br />Do I think you should rent this? Maybe, especially if you're gay like me! But you should definitely do some research before buying because not everyone will like it. Like I said, it was good the first time I watched, and the second time I stopped watching it for some reason...about half way through. Tonight I watched it and it just felt kind of empty...It just didn't keep me glued like it did the first time around. That's why if anything, I think you should just rent it first.<br /><br />Don't get this:<br /><br />*If you don't like action<br />*If you want a strong story<br />*If you don't enjoy fictitious movies<br /><br />5.5 (or 2.75 stars).

B00000K19E|5.0|Like this needs another review. This is one of the best SiFi movies ever produced and no one who claims to know SiFi should have missed it. If you have never seen it, then buy it. You do not need to rent this movie, as that would be a waste of money. Go straight to the counter and make the purchase. It is so overwhelming that you should put it on a shelf and only break it out on special occasions. This is the type of movie that sticks in your mind.

B000EOTAM6|4.0|A very good movie in the area of Si-Fi., I liked it and have watched it multiple times. The special effects are excellent and so is the acting. It is not something I would normally add to my video library, but I bought it before seeing it and still I have no regrets. I do recommend seeing it before adding it to your video collection.

015603283X|4.0|I picked up this book because I enjoyed the movie.  As usual, it was much better than the movie.  The book had another plot that the movie never touches, one which I found even more entertaining.  Unfortunately, I found that the book left me asking just as many questions as the movie did.  I only give it four stars because I found that the author was a little long-winded at times.  Enjoy!
B000Q66PXE|1.0|I must agree with the first viewer.  What in the world are you thinking?  I have been a staunch Amazon customer for years, but I am appalled that you would think anyone would pay $49.99 for Season One and $49.99 for Season Two OR $179.99 for BOTH.  Are the discs gold plated?  What train of thought went behind this?  Please say that it was an obvious error and that you meant to say $79.99 for both Seasons.
1594489505|4.0|Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini's second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, recounts Afghanistan's troubled history of the last several decades through the eyes of a segment of the Afghan population that probably suffered and lost the most during that period, its women. The novel's two main characters, Mariam and Laila, two very different women, are thrown together because of what seems like a never-ending war, and their almost helpless struggle for survival comes to represent the struggle of their very country for the same.<br /><br />Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman, lived in isolation with her mother in a tiny hut for the first 15 years of her life. When forced into marriage with a 40-year old Kabul shopkeeper, she finds herself unable to provide him the sons he so desires. Laila is the only daughter of a family who lives in the same Kabul neighborhood that Mariam has settled into and Mariam has been vaguely aware of her since Laila was a small child.<br /><br />Having been raised in such different circumstances, the women are not natural allies. On the one hand, Mariam has been raised without a father and in a society that treats illegitimate children as outcasts. Laila, on the other hand, was raised by a father who was determined to see her educated and who always told her that she could be anything that she wanted to be. But as their world becomes more and more subject to strict Islamist law and the women realize that they have almost no rights under that law, they find that they have more in common than they realized. And they find that they need each other.<br /><br />The recent history of Afghanistan is a tragic one. Its people have been living in a war zone for decades, beginning with the Soviet occupation, and each time that things seemed to be getting better, the country was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The Soviet army was forced to leave by jihadist warlords who almost immediately launched their own civil war when the Soviets cleared out. And the warlords destroyed much of what had not already been destroyed before the Taliban faction became strong enough to take control of the government. And, of course, after the Taliban had systematically destroyed modern Afghan society, returned the country to the standards of the 7th century and given safe haven to Osama bin Laden, the United States and her allies invaded the country in hopes of capturing bin Laden and destroying the group responsible for the September 11, 2001 attack on New York City.<br /><br />That is the history of Afghanistan that we all know. But A Thousand Splendid Suns makes the reader feel and understand Afghanistan's story in a way that reading newspaper headlines will never do it. The book did not leave me feeling optimistic about that region's future. In fact, being reminded of the potential for havoc and genocide there due to the many tribal differences had the opposite effect on me. It makes me realize how dangerous it is to upset the very fragile stability that countries in that part of the world have achieved for themselves.<br /><br />The book also contains one of the saddest sentences that I have ever read it a novel:<br /><br />  \\"One last time, Mariam did as she was told.\\"<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini is a fine writer, as he has shown with this novel and with his first, The Kite Runner. The story he tells here is a tragic one for sure, but I somehow expect that Afghan reality is even more terrible than Hosseini portrays it in this book. Nevertheless, this is a provocative novel and I highly recommend it to all.leared out.

074356619X|5.0|I have watched the DVD and listen to the audio book version every night while falling asleep.  I HAVE seen my life turn around as a result of the information in this title.  The problem I see from those who give this title such a negative review is that they are filtering their reviews based upon expectations that were unrealistic.<br /><br />One has to take personal responsibility for ones own actions behind what they learn from this title - and apply the principles.  I never expected to just wish for something and then it would magically appear as some have commented in their reviews.  You have to do the leg work and the rest comes into play - it's called reciprocity.  You get what you give - which is another form of the law of attraction.  I have found that I have a new outlook on life after so much negativity being perpetuated by myself for the majority of my adult life.  If this title can bring a positive  perspective to life then it has done its job.  I have seen my business increase, my mental outlook on life has become positive, and much more.  I gave a copy to each of my grown children and they have told me that The Secret has changed their lives as well.<br /><br />So for those detractors who had some type of expectation that was let down - rethink your position - Rhonda and the rest of the people involved with The Secret have changed the lives of people I have come in contact with - for the better.

Khan is one of the best singers come recent, check him out on his old band called \\"Conception\\" awesome!
1582701709|2.0|Nothing really new here. Sort of a new age propaganda film, with inconsistencies, and silly statements not backed up (sure, positive thinking brought checks in the mail). A couple of people went beyond the blatantly materialistic tone of the movie, but mostly it was me-me-me.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|I love the dvd, but I noticed what some people have complained about and that's the vox during the 5.1 The center channel seems to much lower thant the other speakers, dont know if it's a mixing thing or defect, but if you put it in PCM and use Dolby prologic II you'll be fine it still kicks butt. The video is excellent, the songs are awesome and Khan is a GREAT vocalist! I am happy with the dvd, just wish the center channel thing was better.
0618680004|5.0|Once again, Dawkins writes a readily approachable, carefully argued volume.  He explains how and why the scientific method must be brought to bear on theistic claims, and why one must feel free to critically appraise the modern, evolved remnants of various human-created stone- and bronze-age cults, still uncritically adopted by billions of people who were carefully indoctrinated as children to avoid questioning matters of religious doctrine.    Dawkins gets an unfair rap for (supposedly) being contentious, arrogant and acerbic. None of those alleged qualities are visible in this book.  Dawkins does not argue against theism by calling it, or its practitioners, insulting names. Instead, he relies on the theists' own arguments to demonstrate their vacuity, and on the scientific method as a tool for building bodies of knowledge that were unavailable when primitive humans first tried to explain their surrounding using superstition. At the same time, he is unafraid to use his human capacity for moral judgment to call out immoral pretensions hiding in the cloak of religiosity.    Doubtless, what drives the ad hominem attacks on Dawkins is the human reaction to act defensively when one feels threatened.  This is especially true when (1) you have been indoctrinated from early childhood to believe something and (2) to connect that belief to your family, your community and your childhood, and (3) when you are explicitly indoctrinated to resist any attempts to discuss or critique that belief.  Paradoxically, the people who really need this book are those who are least likely to read it.    One thing to bear in mind when reading this book is that for space reasons, Dawkins condenses some topics.  For instance, chapter 4 (\\"Why There Almost Certainly Is No God\\") disposes of the creationist/\\"intelligent design\\" argument that irreducible complexity exists in nature and can only be explained by a hypothetical creator.  In practice, this chapter is a shortened version of argument presented in [[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design]].  Similarly, chapter 3 (\\"Arguments For God's Existence\\") provides condensed versions of various critiques of these supposed arguments presented over the past several hundred years by Gaunillo to Russell through to the present day.  Frankly, this is probably good - if every chapter treated every topic in complete depth, the book would be implausibly long and many potential readers would be put off by size alone.  Dawkins provides a thorough and helpful bibliography and footnotes, so a reader not already fully aware of these arguments is free to look up the cites and explore them in more depth.
1596912855|4.0|I completely related to the main character in the first chapter - heck, I related to the author as she dedicated the novel to Colin Firth (made me laugh out loud what she wrote!).  It's not going to win any literary prizes but it was fun and entertaining. Maybe because I've been there (I still watch P & P on a biweekly basis - my three year old daughter is familiar with Mr. Darcy herself).   A good read for those of us a wee bit obsessed with BBCs Pride and Prejudice.  I'm just glad I'm married to my Mr. Darcy (with a bit of Mr. Knightley thrown in).

I do think it's one of his better albums, so if do you like King Diamond, this one's going to blow you away!
B0000025D0|5.0|Ok I am biased. It is my favourite album of all time. But I hadn't listened for a while and did so today and it blew me away yet again. I'm not going into this track by track. Other reviewers have done a great job at that. The best rock music has passion at its core and this album has more than that. The songs are great although Bruce has commented that he oversang and the band underplayed. Maybe. It doesn't matter this is essential music, essential Bruce. Next year is this record's 30th anniversary. Let's hope for a Darkness box set including a dvd from 1978 (Largo for instance). You know, there's always someone. Cast your eyes over a review by Rich Yampell. I am a songwriter myself. Take it from me pal - you do not have a clue. A song does not have to have complicated chord changes etc to make it a great song. In fact a lot of times less is more. You've probably just come out of college so you still have time to learn. If you don't like it that's fine but please spare us your 'expertise'. Suggesting Badlands took Bruce 5 minutes to write. What an idiot.
B00005JMXX|3.0|As improbable as `The Day After Tomorrow' really is, it doesn't have to be realistic to fulfill its purpose.  It's not there to really engage us emotionally or mentally as much as visually, and in that visual sense `The Day After Tomorrow' soars.  Now director Roland Emmerich is no stranger to the science fiction disaster film, and not unlike his previously successful entries, this one also sports some amazing special effects.  From twirling twisters to tidal waves and that slowly creeping icy air, `The Day After Tomorrow' sports an amazing lineup of natural disasters.  Watching the multiple tornadoes rip through the California city is impressive, and watching gallon upon gallon of water drown New York City is nothing short of breathtaking.  So, it's safe to say that what `The Day After Tomorrow' lacks in brains it makes up for in cool CGI effects.<br /><br />So, what of this plot?  Well, it appears that weather patterns are showing an alarming possibility that soon, within the next hundred or so years, we could undergo yet another ice-age.  That's where Jack Hall comes in, a climatologist who discovers the evidence to support this.  Of course no one will pay attention to Hall and his discovery will prove true, except not even Hall expected it to happen so soon.  The real story though involves Jack's son Sam who has traveled to New York with some class mates and ends up in the middle on a flood that destroys the city.  Jack then has to race to his rescue before he freezes to death.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot is plenty far fetched, but the action more than makes up for it.  As Sam and his friends try to survive they must find food and medical supplies while fighting the increasing cold, the rising waters and a pack of temperamental wolves who happen to escape confinement during the flood.  The wolf pack has been met with mixed reviews, as in some loved it an others found it ridiculous and unnecessary.  I loved it.  It was an interesting and intense inclusion, even if it wasn't the slightest bit realistic.  When the movie as a whole is completely unbelievable and, yes, unrealistic, then there's nothing wrong with adding even more layers of complete and utter fiction as long as it looks good.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, it's all decent.  Your standard action film acting if you so desire to label it.  Dennis Quaid is one of those actors who I've always enjoyed yet felt he never really tapped into his potential, save except his performance in 2002's `Far From Heaven', and here he delivers but again it's nothing beyond acceptable.  Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor with a future, that's for sure, and his performances are always believable and effortless.  Here he does a great job juggling emotions amid a hole-riddled plot.  Emmy Rossum should really stick to singing, as her grandest performance was in `The Phantom of the Opera' but at least here she delivers a stronger performance than her `Poseidon' disaster.  The strongest performance here though came from the actress with the least screen time, Sela Ward.  She is just the definition of class and she manages to instill emotion in a rather emotionless film.<br /><br />So, in the end `The Day After Tomorrow' delivers some extraordinary eye candy and is worthy of any science fiction action movie buffs library.  No, it's not smart, but it doesn't need to be; and to answer the question of some in regards to the movie's title, it refers to the day `AFTER' the calamity, when everything is not what it once was.  Come on people; is it really that hard to figure out?n't the slightest bit realistic.

B000R9J3XE|4.0|Alternative rock band Garbage may not have created the techno/rock sound but they certainly have made it commercially appealing to the masses. After twelve years as band, Shirley, Butch, Duke, and Steve have reached a point of giving the public a greatest hits collection aptly titled ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Is it garbage so to speak? Absolutely no. The single disc collection runs almost 80 minutes long. The cd contains the band's biggest hits as well as one new song (\\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\\") and their contributions to a James Bond film (\\"The World is Not Enough\\") and the modern version of ROMEO AND JULIET (\\"#1 Crush\\"). Most of the songs are from the band's first two albums [[ASIN:B000001OAA Garbage]] and [[ASIN:B000006NZV Version 2.0]]. There are at least two tracks from [[ASIN:B00005OM4F Beautifulgarbage]] and [[ASIN:B0007Y8A06 Bleed Like Me]]. Maybe because they didn't spawn any major hits like their first two albums. Personally the band should have turned this greatest hits collection into a two disc set and included more songs from those albums.<br /><br />I am glad the band gave their songs a remastering treatment especially the songs from their self-titled album which frankly sounded dreck production-wise. I am also glad they inlcuded \\"The World is Not Enough\\" and \\"#1 Crush\\". Of all the James Bond songs from the past few years, Garbage's theme song is my personal favorite. Their new song \\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\\" is great. I can't help but think how much the song sounds like the theme song to that cheesetastic show THE LOVE BOAT. Despite missing a couple of songs from the band's last two albums, ABSOLUTE GARBAGE is a great compilation of the band's music.
B000QXDED6|1.0|Had I not seen \\"The History Channel Presents: Last Stand of the 300 - The Legendary Battle at Thermopylae\\" afew months ago, then I probably would've given this movie more stars... Unfortunately, I did watch it, and seeing how historically inaccurate this movie was really killed my viewing experience.<br />King Leonidas never met Xerxes, and The 300 never left the pass, they fought there, and died there...<br />I'm not going to list the things that were changed in this movie, because it can be sumed up in 2 words, \\"Virtually Everything.\\"<br />If you've never heard the true story of the battle of Thermopylae, then by all means watch this movie. You'll enjoy it, you may even love it... But for those of you who know the story, leave it! Once you know the true story, it's impossible to fully enjoy this movie. I tried looking at it from a fictional stand point, but it didn't help! There were NO monsters and NO mutants at the battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans DIDN'T dress like that, and the Oracles of Delphi were NOT slaves!!!<br />With that said, on to the pros and cons of this movie...<br /><br />PROS: Brilliant coreographpy.<br />Intense battle seqences!<br />Nicely done visuals.<br />Good acting.<br /><br />CONS: Historically inaccurate!<br />Monsters & mutants of all kinds plague this movie! (I think I even saw a warrior of Enubas at one point...?)<br />This movie proves that there is a such thing as unnessessary nude scenes, all the naked women in the world couldn't possibly save this film...<br />The 300 do not follow their actual battle protocols in this movie, they break formation often, and don't implement several Spartan battle stratagies!<br />Several of the 300 are killed by the Imortals, which didn't really happen...<br />Viewing this movie a 2nd time in 16:9 Widescreen was even worse than my first time in Full Screen.<br />The ending seemed terribly familiar to the ending of Gladiator, hmmmmm...?<br />If they were willing to go so far from the true story, then why didn't they make it end that King Leonidas killed Xerxes and returns home???<br />Towards the end of the movie, when King Leonidas' wife urges the grand counsel of Greece to send more soldiers to aid the 300, she tells them all of Xerxes past victories over other countries, and warns them that if they don't send help, history will repeat itself. At that point, one of the men who's working for Xerxes says, \\"I don't need a history lesson, my Queen.\\" Then my brother blurted out, \\"Yeah, but this movie sure does...\\" Hence the title of my review.<br /><br />Overall: This is a great movie if you're a woman, since pretty much the whole movie consists of nothing but muscular Greek men running about half naked. And if you've never heard the true story, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.

0753820250|4.0|My way to pay \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" a compliment is to compare it to what I believe is a very underappreciated book: Michael Cox's \\"The Meaning of Night\\".  I was amazed not to find \\"Meaning..\\" among the list of similar books provided here at Amazon, and somewhat disappointed to find other books that in my opinion are less deserving of the association(e.g. \\"The Kite Runner\\"). In \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" you will find wonderfully developed, original characters (with a lovely tinge of spanish personality and sarcastic humor) and a beautifully described historical setting. In \\"Shadow..\\", we get even more and quicker plot twists and turns, though I actually believe \\"Meanings..\\" plot is tighter and its conclusion less predictable.<br /><br />All in all, both are riveting, intelligent and unforgettable books.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I was first shown this movie in the 8th grade at Bethany School, during our very last few music classes before graduation.  That was 1992.  Since then, I have devoured this masterpiece of cinematography time and time again.  I am very well aware that this is not an accurate documentary of Mozart's life, and there is indeed much outright fiction in this plot.  This does not diminish the power of the film.    I won't dock any stars, but if I have one complaint about this Director's Cut, it is that we have no choice but to see the added scenes during the watching of the movie.  They should have given these extra scenes a separate spot on the special features menu, perhaps with an option of turning the scenes on or off while viewing the entire movie.  The scenes, while interesting if you are an Amadeus buff, are definitely extraneous and were originally cut out with good reason.  The topless Constanza scene where she gets double-crossed by Salieri is good for the obvious, but little more.  The scene with the dogs, and other additional scenes of dialogue, simply cause the movie to run for too long.  Also, the second DVD with the interviews is excellent and warrants an extra star.    This film, along with \\"Mr. Holland's Opus,\\" remind me what classical music, indeed music *period*, is all about.  It also reminds me of how stupid and unproductive jealousy is.  I don't say this as a moralistic preacher; I am a professional classical violinist myself, and while I am highly talented and can play most (but not all) music ever written for the violin, I was by no means a prodigy, I didn't receive any kind of first-rate training until the college years, and at the moment I face a maelstrom of competition just to win a section position in, say, the Richmond Symphony in Virginia (in other words, an honorable and professional but not-top-5 orchestra).  During my late undergrad and Masters degree years, I met a number of violinists who WERE full-blown prodigies.  Some of these peoplewere easily able, it seemed, to win a job with a major orchestra like the New York Philharmonic.  I can completely sympathize with Salieri's jealousy, particularly towards Mozart the Child, who received nothing but the best of the best of the best training, mostly from his highly musical father.  Many musical prodigies I have known in my own life are so perfect precisely because of error-free training early in the childhood years, something I most certainly did not receive.      With regard to my own personal circumstances, it's so easy to be consumed with jealousy over these prodigy-darlings, but when I watch \\"Amadeus,\\" I think to myself: \\"Gee, Salieri, just imagine if you had chosen to be Mozart's friend instead.  What if you had refused to allow jealousy to get the upper hand?  Think of the great friendship and wonderful musical projects the two of you could have collaborated on!\\"      Then one day, while watching this film again, I said to myself: \\"Come on, now, Adam.  Look in the mirror.\\"

B000QUCNP4|4.0|Since Panic Room seems like a million years ago and was, in truth, quite disappointing after the heights of Fight Club and Seven, I did not rush out to see Zodiac.  However, as soon as I did start watching it, right from the incredibly beautiful long shot from inside the car at the beginning of the film, I suddenly remembered that David Fincher is one of the most supremely visually gifted directors out there and that it would probably be worth watching just about anything he directed (except, well, maybe an old Paula Abdul video).  Fincher seems to be something of a perfectionist and his movies are so richly detailed and carefully assembled that it just reminds you depressingly how slapdash most other films are in comparison.  The production design is fantastic here and you really do feel like you are back in the 60s and 70s without it feeling cliched and caricatured.    Zodiac is probably just a tad too long for its own good and has the problem of having to stick to a set of historical facts that might not have provided the most highly dramatic framework in the second half of the film, which has a slightly different feel than the first as it moves into the investigative section following Gyllenhaal's character Graysmith and away from the deeds of the Zodiac killer (though they try mighty hard to add dramatic punch to expository scenes where they can).  The acting is generally excellent, particularly Ruffalo, Downey and the underappreciated Anthony Edwards.  The movie is probably more successful as a portrait of the ripple effects of a violent criminal on the individuals he touches and a bit less successful as a portrait of obsessive behavior in the form of Graysmith's growing singlemindedness about the case.  This falls just short of a five star film but not by much and it shows a tremendous confidence and maturity about it that bodes well for Fincher's future; Fincher could easily have moved in the direction of more and more flash and less substance but this pieceof work is a good sign.  This film's not going to be for everyone given the serial killing subject matter and given the length, restrained pacing, and the ultimate inconclusiveness of the ending, but the rest of you know who you are: just see it.    On the other hand, maybe you should just wait a bit longer if you've waited until now.  As has been reported in other review posts, a director's version is advertised on this dvd as coming soon.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the book \\"Point of Impact\\" from Steven Hunter, I was looking forward to this movie's release. Alas, the action-packed evening that I had anticipated never came to be. Instead, I popped the \\"Shooter\\" DVD into my player and lost two hours to the inexorable sands of time.    Those who converted the suspense novel \\"Point of Impact\\" into this generic, Schlitz-beer-brand \\"action\\" movie have an extraordinary talent for taking something decent and completely ruining it. They have the same kind of talent as a mechanic who can turn a BMW into a Ford Pinto. I'll spare you the laundry list of changes that the were made to make the story \\"more fit\\" for television. Sufficient to say they failed. The storyline was made into a tedious and stereotyped affair, they successfully removed every bit of interest from it.     As I watched the movie, I realized I didn't care one bit for any of the protagonists. The villains who were interesting in the book were replaced by lifeless drones who failed to provoke any fear. The evil senator reminded me of an old, yet still mischievous Mickey Rooney. A burnt-out Danny Glover was all they could produce to play the evil Colonel Shreck.    Mark Wahlberg did a half-way decent job playing a backwoods country boy veteran. I say half-decent because it was also half-terrible. He sported the foam baseball cap and the flannel shirt, but never really convinced me he was Bob Lee Swagger. He is a fine actor, but this role did not really suit him.    If you read \\"Point of Impact,\\" don't pollute your fond memories of the suspense novel with this travesty. To those who have not read \\"Point of Impact,\\" there are much better action movies out there.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I bought this after seeing Wicked in Chicago.  Although I think the CD is great, I got to see and hear Carmen Cusack as Elphaba and I think she sounds much better than the original cast on the CD.
0767812387|1.0|I was invited by my friend's mom and sister to watch this movie.  To be polite, I had no choice but to sit down and watch the whole thing and pretend that I enjoyed it.  It might be great for people who like dancing movies, but to me, every minute of it was torture.      You can guess what happens.  Just like in every other dance movie that has ever been made, an unlikely dance couple is thrust into each other's arms.  They must defy all odds and learn how to dance like the wind and somehow achieve glory in some \\"highly touted\\" dance competition.  Woopty do.    Guys, if you are thinking about renting a chick flick to impress your significant other and are considering \\"Dance with Me,\\" let me tell you, this one should definitely be avoided.  There are other \\"light romantic comedies\\" out there that are much more bearable than this one.
0553801503|5.0|I am far from giving up on this series and still very much enjoyed this volume within it.  But I too was somewhat frustrated with the omission of so many of the best characters/POVs in this one.  I understand why it was done and am certainly looking to catching up with the others in this book's companion, but it did make the experience of reading this book, which I so looked forward to, a little bit disappointing too.  But anyone who has enjoyed the first books of the series should definitely keep going with it, in my opinion.
B00005JPLW|5.0|It was an enjoyable film because there were excellent battle scenes between the Spartans and the hordes of Persians.  I love movies like Braveheart that have huge battle scenes between historic armies.  This movie gave me what I wanted, epic clashes between two ancient and determined fighting forces.  Movies with great action are lacking these days and chick flicks are taking over.  It was nice to see a movie that defied this trend.    Just to make sure that the movie doesn't bother you, I will review three characteristics of the movie that seem to inflame a lot of people.  They are:  the historical accuracy (or lack of accuracy) of the movie, the sight of muscular men, and the politically incorrect message.    As for the historical accuracy, even the well-read amongst us are not commonly versed with the specific details of ancient battles.  However, it was still obvious that some of the tactics that the Spartans used resembled matrix-style superman fighting rather than actual ancient battle tactics.  Still, the action was great.  There were plenty of sword-fighting, spears being thrust, arrows zinging, hell, there were even attack Elephants and wizards throwing ancient fire bombs.  Yeah, it might not have been 100% accurate, but it is an action movie, not a history channel documentary.  For action, it gets 10 out of 10.    In regards to the second problem, a lot of people, mostly male viewers, are complaining because all of the Spartans had muscular physiques and wore a small amount of clothing.  If you are a modern man, metrosexual or otherwise, and as a result you are too \\"catty\\" to see men who are more buffed than yourself, then maybe you should avoid this movie.      The last problem is the message.  This message is about about bravery and being willing to fight for the cause.  This upsets a lot of people in this day of age when empty things like bravado are shunned.  If you detest movies that celebrate patriotism, defiance, an utter determination in the face of adversity and foreign invasion, then you might find this movie to be offensive.    On the other hand, if you appreciate a good action flick and liked movies like Braveheart, then this movie is highly recommended.
B00000C3G6|5.0|\\"Southbound Train\\" is one of those songs that, in my opinion, you love the first time you hear it.  Remember: all lead guitar you hear on this CD is played by the great Jerry Garcia.  In my opinion, this CD contains the apex of David Crosby's lyricism, especially on the last track, The Wall.  This is my favorite Crosy/Nash album.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|First let me say that I enjoyed this film. The subject is of great interest to me and despite a few flaws I think the film is overall, much better than many have given it credit for. I watched 'Munich' for the first time quite awhile ago but felt compelled to ofer my analysis after reading the wide-ranging reviews on here. I think it is significant that Spielberg has been accused of being both too pro-Israeli, and too pro-Palestinian/terrorist. I would argue that the majority of these critics on either side are extremists themselves, and are therefore unable to appreciate the film's complexity and OBJECTIVITY. If you see the situation in black and white, then you are not going to be satisfied with the portrayal of events in 'Munich.' With that said, Spielberg himself said that the film is in no way intended to question the morality of Israel's retaliation, but to explore the \\"unintended consequences\\" of these actions. Whatever. Personally I thought the film was quite ambiguous, and thus it is not surprising that there are so many contradictory reviews. I will say one subtle but interesting theme that I picked up on; 'Munich' seems to be asking if the Israelis have gotten so caught up in being Israeli, that they have forgotten how to be Jewish.<br /><br />I thought the acting was good all-around, especially Eric Bana as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, and the underrated Ciaran Hinds as Carl. As with all of Spielberg's films, the cinematography, dialogue, and character development are all excellent. Say what you will about him, Spielberg knows how to make good films. He has the talent for putting nice touches on his films, like the recurring soundtrack of a beating heart in scenes of impending danger here in Munich. All in all, a very suspenseful and action-packed film.<br /><br />As for the flaws, I agree that it began to drag a bit at the end and probably could have had twenty minutes or so edited out. As for the factual accuracy, I agree that some of the elements (like the French family of information brokers) were a bit of a reach, but as I always say, this is movie, not a documentary, and this did nothing to damage the film's \\"watchability\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would rate this film 4 out of 5 stars. Whether it is ambiguity or objectivity, I'm not quite sure, but there is something in 'Munich' for either side of the conflict to take issue with. Personally I think that is a good thing.family of information brokers) were a bit of a reach, but as I always say, this is movie, not a documentary, and this did nothing to damage the film's \\"watchability\\" in my opinion.

B000PMGS8G|4.0|I've just finished watching the new LONG AWAITED RE-RELEASE of FLASH GORDON on  R1 DVD released today, AUG. 7, 2007. I will try to offer a few comments and comparisons between this edition and the UK 25TH SILVER ANNIVERSARY RELEASE....WHY? Because given some of the fan fussing that's popping up comparing the two and what shoulda-woulda-coulda-been, someone out there, might think they're missing something in this R1 release and feel they need to make a fevered dash to get the other...maybe this will help you decide whether it's worth the effort. BUT IN A NUTSHELL: IN THIS REVIEWER'S OPINION, I suggest you don't run and get the other unless you're an absolute purist.....I bought the UK SILVER ANNIV. EDITION before this was available and used up one of my region options on my laptop to convert it (then bought a region free right after ...lol.....and now I WISH I DIDN'T bother with it all and just waited FOR THIS!:-)    Naturally, being the uber-geek I am, I had to compare the two prints....R1 VS. UK......the R2 being the one many of us were stuck having to get and convert to be able to have this in our collections before this edition  showed up today (UNLESS of course we paid big bucks for the monsterously overpriced original R1 release or Ebay bootlegs). I have to say.......I REALLY LIKE THIS R1 \\"SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE\\" PRINT *BETTER* than all of the releases! Ultimately, in \\"upgrading\\", at least here in this house, it's the PRINT that determines what is worth the upgrade. THIS IS THE PRINT TO GET.     It not only is CLEANER by most appearances...it is also crisper. I compared many scenes side by side and it is quite obvious that the SOTU print is the CLEAREST of the two. So in that sense, I'd say you were better off with this one......details in faces are more defined for example........there isn't that washed out VHS look to them in some scenes ....certainly not to the extent that one sees in the UK edition.     HOWEVER: There is a trade-off. The SOTU PRINT IS DARKER.......*much* darker than our UK cousin's (and at this point, my memory can't tell me if THIS is how it REALLY looked in the theaters VS. the UK's print). In the UK edition, it is super bright......reds are almost too bright.......in some scenes there's that super contrasty....too much tint feel to the reds which sends my WS into seizures. HERE.......in the SOTU ed., everything is much more subdued and darker....feels more natural in comparison. Sure.....there's the bright colors, but by comparison to the UK print, it is almost a different flick in that category....seriously...comparing the prints color-wise, is like comparing two different color designs. I kind of wish there were a happy medium between the two........but this edition suits me just fine, though some of you may wish to trade off the clarity for coloration. Personally, I wouldn't, because this version feels nice....solid....yet still holds bright color, it's just not so in your face as the other's. Now, someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but in the UK edition, the bright colors SEEM more like a print ISSUE *than* an actual *INTENTION*.    PACKAGING: The R1 SOTU EDITON wins hands down over the UK release. I REALLY DIG THIS BOX it comes in. When you open the outer factory package/plastic......the case is actually a box that has a lid that flips open....like a clip board. It's medium glossed, very artfully done, and well assembled...it's ALL PRINTED...not some labels slapped onto a black box....it's like a hardback....not flimsy. Pop this open, and inside/lying over the disc tray is the ALEX ROSS POSTCARD/PRINT (actually a pencilled work....which is surprising since the cover of this DVD set would've made a better choice, though that would've cost \\"poor\\" Sony color printing costs...lol....and this is printed on one side, then there's a blank verso with a tiny Universal logo in the corner). And underneath is the disc.....the underside to the lid is a montage of photos. This is the contents of the package. THE UK ED. comes in a silver keepcase....advertisement inserts &  the DVD. This SOTU release just LOOKS COOLER all black...and ROSS' cover really pops. Good job to the art/production department there! Some think the UK edition is all blinged out....but I'd always thought the \\"silver\\" plastic keep case looked really cheap....this here just looks freaking cool.    SPECIAL FEATURES: YES....IMO, they could've done better on these...MUCH BETTER......no doubt.....I mean, fans of this film have waited patiently for it to come, enduring the UK 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION and scratching their heads why we were bypassed, so this was a chance to make everyone happy. Well, here we are. And I think fans are being unfair towards the segment on ALEX ROSS (13 min.)....whom, were he mixed in with other  SF's wouldn't be judged so harshly as a \\"who cares what he says\\" feature....if I were Ross, I'd be screaming at the producers of this package for making him the whipping boy. ROSS, is extremely talented and his segment was enjoyable to watch.........now should it be one of the two ONLY real features here? HECK NO. This was a poor decision and puts a talented artist on the bad end of the stick being swung by rabid fans who'd been waiting YEARS to land a legit copy of this film. \\"A look back\\" feature or interviews....even old ones would've been nice ....something more MOVIE FOCUSED....the content of the SF's feels like some frigging student was in charge whom was clueless about the cult interest of this film. LORENZO SEMPLE's (9+min.) segment too, felt like it could've used some other features to back it up. With OTHER FEATURES, these two would've been nice extras to fatten the package.....but alone......they seem a little off balanced, and as if the studio was a little disinterested in pursuing more meat for this release (insert chicken sound: \\"cheap! cheap!\\")........a strange thing considering this has been a LONG AWAITED RE-RELEASE and the fan base IS THERE......I mean, what's upwith that? And NEITHER RELEASE HAS DELETED SCENES.    If all the info on the Net is true, then SONY BEING CHEAP is the reason we have what we got. And I'd hafta agree, the SAM  JONES AND MELODY ANDERSON COMMENTARIES would have been more than welcome. The \\"SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE EDITON\\" blurb, truly FAILS to deliver in terms of content. I wouldn't be so harsh were it not for the fact that there IS stuff out there. I understand there's rights and all that, but you can't tell me the studios don't have access to at least their OWN ORIGINAL promo stuff. EEEERGH! What a MISSED OPORTUNITY. But as others have stated......we should all really just swallow it at this point considering the original release was not much of an option once it went OOP (it was one of the earliest DVD's released!)....and at this point, WHY would you want THAT particular print anyway? EDIT: I also hafta chime in on the fact....for this fan at least.....I mean really....once I listened to the commentaries for the UK edition, I haven't touched them since....nor have I watched the Hodges interview again nor thumbed through the photo gallery (which wasn't ALL THAT to begin with), so even THAT edition wasn't the be all end all if you want \\"definitive\\". I found them really boring considering SAM JONES has been making the fan circuit FOR YEARS and coulda been had for I'm sure a decent, not too expensive fee. Geeeeeez!    ASPECT: Anamorphic 2.35:1 (for those who don't know: you WILL have tiny bars at the top AND bottom).  SPECIAL FEATURES (Ross & Semple) are 4x3 (Bars on the sides)  TIME: 1 hr. 52 mn.  THE SOUND: MUCH BETTER HERE than the UK EDITION, IMO. UK feels tinny....this actually bumps.    OVERALL: I am QUITE HAPPY I'D UPGRADED to this edition. YES.....there're flaws.....YES............the UK editon has the 2 commentaries......Hodges Interview...the slideshow.........oh yea...and the  1940 serial (this HAS A SERIAL too BTW). But, I certainly can live without them on this one considering the optionsfor OFFICIAL R1......which is an OUTDATED INFERIOR PRINT ON OOP DVD. Course, that's because I have both current releases, so I'm not feeling as short changed as some understandably might. Even if I didn't.....the PRINT is all that should really matter, and if I had to pick.......hands down, I'd pick THIS PRINT, sure, it's a darker print BUT it still allows for the bright comic book design to still come through, VERSUS the washed out and super bright UK print.....which, when comparing side by side, feels like they might've used a Laserdisc source to REMASTER their print (reminds me of the ORIGINAL STAR WARS print that was recently released as a 2 disc.....you know....that kinda soft edged look to everything). And once again I say........I honestly can't say WHICH OF THESE TWO looks more like the film did when I saw it in its original theatrical run as a kid.....seriously folks..........I can't tell nor remember if THIS IS WHAT IT IS SPOSED TO LOOK LIKE to complain.  So yea.... there could have certainly been more stuff on here as extras.....but d@mn..................let's not forget how long we've waited for this to even resurface legitimately....sure it's a missed opportunity.....sure it coulda been better........but it's here, and that's it baybee............and once you see THIS PRINT (let's not forget: it's THE MOVIE we want folks! lol!)....I think at least a few of you will be quite happy to have it like I am.....now.............I think I'm gonna find something much more fullfilling to complain about ....tonight at least.    MOVIE: 4.5  PACKAGING: 5  DVD CONTENT: 4.5  VERSUS OTHER RELEASES (UK & PREVIOUS R1): 5
1400032717|1.0|This book was an extreme waste of time. I read it purely because of the high praise it has received, which will not be found here. First, I'm not a moron who can't understand that sometimes a book is not just a book, but this one, in my opinion, was always passed off as somewhat of a murder mystery led by an autistic child. This is not what it is. After all, the murder is solved mid-book.<br /><br />The beginning starts off well enough and even made me laugh. Although, I continued to feel for Christopher throughout the book, I had no empathy for the dysfunctional family, and I know what it's like to come from a dysfunctional family. SPOILERS: Am I supposed to feel something for a woman who walks out on her kid because \\"she can't take it\\" and leaves her family to have an affair that doesn't look very good either. Not only that but later when she finally reconnects with Christopher she seems not to have needed a vacation from him, as we are first led to understand, but would like to be the best mother in the world on certain days and alternating weekends. In other words, she still can't seem to hack it, even though she is forcing her way into his life. Christopher's father on the other hand I did admire for being a single dad with an autistic child, but even that is lost when you find out he has been lying to Christopher about his mother's death, and that he killed the dog because it was loved more than he.<br /><br />To top it all off, there are a few crude references that were unnecessary. This book is one of the reasons I am often weary of mainstream literature: high praise for empty words.

B000LXHK2C|3.0|Definitely a piece of fluff, but a charming film, nonetheless. It's not angst-ridden or filled with the weighty matters of the universe -- just a nice film for the times you just want something to make you smile. I enjoyed seeing Russell Crowe's light-hearted side and thought his portrayal of a London LOMBARD (Lots Of Money But A Real D***head) was pretty accurate. The female characters were all strong, independent women and I appreciated that the British, French and American stereotypes were not overblown or exaggerated. It also helped that I happen to love the region of France where most of the film takes place.
B000UR9T7I|5.0|I have to say Spider-Man 3 was another great addition to the Spider-Man trilogy. I do have to admit I was afraid this movie would not live up to the first two Spider-Man's. I mean those first two were great and how could this one possibly match that? After I finished watching it I can say I was not at all disappointed. I think many people were expecting this to be just like Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 does take more risks than its predecessors by having more villains than usual, but It still manages to entertain, spark emotion and above all inspire and bring out the kid in many of us. It is like the first two with many of the same characters returning, but where Spider-Man 3 differs is when we get to see the dark side (with the black suit) of Spider-Man which takes the movie to a whole new level. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did a great job as usual and brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, that's what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride that I highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the hype of this movie, or the negative things some critics had to say. I went to see Spider-Man 3 to be entertained and I was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 Two-Disc Special Edition DVD, Two-Disc Blu-ray<br /><br />DISC ONE Special Features:<br /><br />* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video<br />* Audio: English Dolby True HD 5.1, English PCM 5.1 (Uncompressed), French, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai 5.1 (Dolby Digital)<br />* Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese Mandarin, Chinese Cantonese<br />* Bloopers<br />* Photo Galleries<br />* Snow Patrol Music Video<br />* Audio Commentary with Director Sam Raimi and Cast Members Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard<br />* Audio Commentary with Producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad and Grant Curtis, Editor Bob Murawski and Special Effects Supervisor Scott Stokdyk<br />* Closed Captioned<br />* Bonus Previews<br /><br />DISC TWO Special Features:<br /><br />* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video<br />* Audio: English, Spanish 5.1 (Dolby Digital).

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Without a doubt this is the most breathe taking adventure that a person would be able to see in their their lifetime. The graphics are unbelievable, and the animals so beautiful. Throughout narrated well by David Attenborough his voice alone adds to the feel and touch of the BBC series. The quality is top natch and could not get any better.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I truly love this album. I was first attracted to the band after hearing Sonne on a Kerrang C.D. I would just repeat it and listen to it over and over. I wouldn't consider myself the greatest Metal fan per se, but the bands I do like from the genre, I love! I put this CD into my CD player, not expecting too much and was absolutely blown away by the opening track `Mein Herz Brennt', and the album shows absolutely no sign of decreasing momentum in the second and third tracks \\"Links 2,3,4\\" or `Sonne\\". There isn't one song on this album I would consider `filler' and every song in its own way is amazing! I couldn't even pick 3 of my favourite songs off this album as they change all the time.<br />It seems like a fusion between industrial metal, classical and euro-trash and it works a great degree!<br /><br />A great listen that will not get old. I recommend it to anyone
0743496728|4.0|The novel was filled with little quotes that kept you reading that one sentence over and over.  The ending was not quite what I had expected, or honestly, had wanted, but the book has made me want to read more of Jodi Picoult.  Highly recommed this book.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Some may discard this review as trite, especially given the dramatic title of this review, however very few albums have ever affected and influenced me as much as this album, that I feel has been tragically over looked by many today. The professional reviews of this album were generally very strong, and how can  anyone consider any album that sells upwards of 8 million copies as a flop? Come on?!<br /><br />I must admit, I did however only purchase this album on the strength of Jagged Little Pill, and even actually disliked Thank U, the lead single. I received this album as a gift, and at first listen I found no stand out songs, and thought the album was very dark and scattered, however when the fog lifts, and you listen to this album more, it presents itself in all its dark, weird and wonderful glory and comes through as one of the most artistic albums EVER!<br />Starting off with Front Row, you may feel bombarded with words and over layering, but under the complexities is the most amazing tune and beat. Try listen to this song loud and sing along with the Lyric Booklet to enjoy it fully. Many songs omit choruses and instead use an increseing momentum effect in each song. This distinguishes the album above and beyond most other singer/song-writers in this genre. It is not an album of radio friendly singles at all, and I couldn't imagine any song other than So Pure being a radio hit, but these songs are far too good for radio. The subtleties like the last 30 seconds of `Your congratulations', or the feeling you get when you listen to \\"I Was Hoping\\" really loud, are things that can only be experienced by listening to the album as a whole.<br /><br />The album highlights, for me are Joining You (an absolute classic), Would not come (perhaps the darkest pop song of all time!?), Front Row, Unsent (an alanis classic), I was Hoping and The couch!!<br /><br />In the modern music scene, which is geared towards easy absorption and instant `catchy-ness' this album shows what music is truly capable of, and the power it can have if you listen to it, instead of just hearing.nd the power it can have if you listen to it, instead of just hearing.
0312323867|5.0|I really enjoyed 'Something Borrowed' but I found this book even more intriguing. I would recommend reading it close to after you read 'Borrowed.' I read them about a year apart and had kind of forgotten some of the things that happened in the first book. The twists and turns in the book were somewhat predictable, but it was still very fascinating and enjoyable. Super easy read--great for the beach! Highly recommend!
B00005ATQH|5.0|I have seen the movie Lolita several times.  Everytime it's on I watch.  I like the suspense of the movie.  The whole time you are watching you don't really know if \\"Lo\\" has some attraction to Hubert, but you do know that Hubert is attracted to her.  It is a great movie, because you know that there is some physical altercations going on, but you don't get to see it.  If you want to watch a clean movie without all the sex that today's movies have this is the one to watch.  By the way that's where my mother got my name.    Lolita M.  Born in 1962
0316067598|5.0|Boy this was some kind of book. Couldn't put the book down.By the middle of the Lone Survivor I thought I was reading somekind of fiction thriller.    I really enjoyed the book but I have some doubts how a rifle can shoot straight after being bounced around and dropped on the mountains like the writer describes.
1582701709|2.0|I have read a few books on powers of the mind, from works on Eastern philosophy to Western psychology.  I would describe this book as mildly entertaining but very light on substance.  I was hoping for a bit more in terms of concrete historical evidence as well as respected expert testimonials.  I agree with S. Winters' comment that the book read like a cheesy, feel-good infomercial.  I can see how this book can appeal to some, but I would have preferred something a little more academic.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Jason Reitman directs the satire THANK YOU FOR SMOKING. This movie isn't worthy of blockbuster status, but is definitely one you should check out. The cast is great, the style is addicting, and the message of the movie, is, well I'm not sure.<br /><br />Smoking is an incredibly political issue now. Politicians have to have the cigarrette industry to make money. They can talk all they want about how bad they are, but if Big Tobacco goes out of business, then the politcians lose billions of dollars. I think the movie hits its mark pointing out the hipocracy of the critics of industries that take the place of personal responsibility. This movie is based on a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative men in US history.<br /><br />The movie stars Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor, the incredibly suave lobbyist for Big Tobacco. His job is to fight the spin that tobacco is bad for you, and he does a great job. Some of the finest scenes are his lunch meeting with fellow lobbyists from Alcohol and Firearms. The movie gets its heart because if Nick's son. Nick struggles with the life he leads and tries to reconcile it with the impression he is leaving his son.<br /><br />If you enjoy smart, intelligent movies, then I urge your to check this one out.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|Firelight is a film with beautiful cinematography. It is about a love story. It has all the right elements, with a gorgeous woman at the center of it all. Sophie Morceau is a young woman, who gets paid to have a nobleman's child. As soon as the coupling is brought to fruition, the child is taken away, with never seeing the child as part of the deal. But feelings outside the deal come into play, and she seeks them out years later, under the guise of a governess. It is the tale of a mother seeking a daughters love, and the unbidden love between a man and a woman.
B00005MP58|5.0|The movie is a bit long, somewhat overexplaining some aspects of the story.  I agree with many of the things previous reviews have said although I disagree about the incorrect casting for the part of Jane.  Athough she is not the knock-out you may have expected her to be, she is the epitome of late-eighteenth century beauty. She is the personification of the period's cameo. Colin Firth plays the most accurate Darcy I've seen to date and it doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes throughout most of the movie!

0316067598|5.0|This isn't the type of book I usually read but,  I was introduced to this book by listening to Marcus Luttrell on a talk radio program.  I feel everyone in this country should read this, for maybe we could understand what our men and women in the military is sacrificing for us.    It is amazing what the Special Forces go throught to become these elite teams.  Marcus is the only survivor of Seal Team 10 and what this man went trough to survive is unbelieveable.    I feel every Congressman should read this     Than  maybe there will not be any questions about letting these men and women do what they were trained to do
B0001HLVS2|4.0|At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain and Franch were mortal enemies fighting for dominance of Europe by land and sea. England was threatened with invasion for the first time in three hundred years. The only thing protecting the isle was the Royal Navy. This is the backdrop of Master and Commander who fights for England with his brave crew and stout ship against France on the far side of the world.<br /><br />Russell Crowe heads a first rate cast that replays a genre that hasn't been seen since Gregory Peck played the title role of \\"Horatio Hornblower.\\" From a consistent script and story, one gets the impression of what life was like on the high seas during this time and how quickly, silently, and deadly mortal danger could arise. There was no sonar or radar save those in one's sight, hearing and judgment. And the fog could be one's enemy as much as it could be a friend.<br /><br />Besides the acting, the music lent perfectly to the story, and one can recognize Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 played by Yo Yo Ma. My favorite was Boccherini's La Musica Notturna Della providing the background for captain's order to beat to \\"General Quarters.\\"<br /><br />As soon as you can, steer a course and set sail to your nearest store and purchase \\"Master and Commander...\\" It's one of those stories that seems to get better with each viewing.
6304602944|5.0|Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone shine in this action comedy. Jack Palance plays the evil drug lord who is insulted on how Russell and Stallone have costed him millions. To allow major shipment to arrive, Palance and his associates come up with a plan to put Russell (Cash) and Stallone (Tango) in prision knowingly that they wont come out alive. Teri Hatcher plays the sultry Kiki who works at an adult club (dancing) and in the movie happens to be Tango's sister. Cash and Tango escape prision, try to find who set them up and find out that Jack Palance is the mastermind. Russell and Stallone had some really funny moments (court scene where Cash just lets it all out on what he thinks), great laughs, and good action. Russell dressed up in drag and being Kiki's property was hillarious. Tango walking in on his sister and Cash; priceless.<br /> Will Tango and Cash defeat Jack Palance? What happens to Captain Dynoball? See the movie!

If you've never seen or heard Joe Bonamassa, this would be a great introduction to his work.
0765348276|5.0|Old Man's War is my favorite type of sci-fi novel.  Scalzi takes an intriguing idea, thinks through the ramifications, develops it into a multifaceted future world, and sets believable characters into a story arc that brings the world to life.  Throw in spaceships and aliens and cool weapons, wrap it in crisp, effortless prose, and the result is a knock-out.    Though Old Man's War qualifies as military sci-fi, it still has a heart.  The story is told by John Perry, a 75-year-old widower who leaves Earth to join the Colonial Defense Force.  Though details are sketchy, CDF recruits know they must somehow be rejuvenated to fight.  The price:  they can never return to Earth or communicate with anyone there.  What's more, they have to survive 10 years of brutal warfare, defending human colonists against a host of violent alien races scrabbling for viable planets.  We follow John and his fellow cadets as they adjust from being aging, earth-bound civilians to superhuman space-faring killing machines.  John, through a combination of luck and quick wits, finds himself at the crux of a major conflict, which eventually leads to a satisfying conclusion.    [** Warning:  thar be mild spoilers in the next paragraph. **]    Looking back, you can almost see Scalzi's chain of thought as he wrote the book.  He started with a simple idea:  What would happen if the military could transfer a soldier's consciousness into a new body custom-built for fighting?  Then he asked the appropriate follow-up questions.  Who would be willing to undergo such a transformation?  Obviously, people who wanted a new body at all costs:  old people.  How would they adjust psychologically?  What incentive would they have to sign up for a deadly war?  What happens if recruits die before they are loaded into their new bodies?  The answers practically write the book, and give Scalzi's world a self-consistency that is easy to buy into.    Story aside, you have to admire Scalzi's ability as a writer.  His proseperks along at just the right pace.  He has an admirable grasp of human nature, and crafts characters that are sympathetic and believable.  The dialogue is smooth and liberally sprinkled with humor.      Overall, Old Man's War was a delight to read, and an awesome debut.  I highly recommend it.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|This movie looks fantastic in HD-DVD.  The special features are robust.  My favorite is the PIP (picture in picture) green screen film version which is not available on Blu-ray.  Here you can see the actual filming of the movie in a sub-window along with a narrative.  This item is a no-brainer!
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|This review was originally posted at criticizethis.net<br /><br />300 is a movie meant to be seen on the big screen. It's big, it's loud, it's a movie opera if you will. Watching it on HD-DVD is the closest you will get to that experience in your living room.<br /><br />The Movie<br /><br />Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, the tale focuses on 300 Spartan warriors led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) as they fight King Xerxes and the Persian army in the Battle of Thermopylae. It's a visually stunning masterpiece in the same vein as Sin City (another Frank Miller adaptation). The narrative story line, special effects, and soundtrack make 300 an experience in which your mouth will fall open in awe. The movie isn't without some flaws (where did that apple come from?), but it is much better than a majority of the big summer blockbusters.<br /><br />Picture & Sound<br /><br />The movie looks amazing on a 1080p display. The colours, contrast, and shadows come alive almost as its own character, and the integral blood-flying scenes are vividly crisp. The sound is mind-blowing in Dolby TrueHD; every slice, stab, and groan during the battle sequences are audible, and the score gave me chills. This is one of the HD-DVD's I will be using to show off what high definition DVD is all about.<br /><br />Special Features<br /><br />The HD-DVD is loaded with features. An exclusive HD-DVD game called Vengeance and Valor lets you lead Spartans into battle with your remote control. Also included is a piece on Frank Miller's vision realized on film, webisodes from the set, extra footage of the Hunchback, never-before-seen footage of the Giant Warriors, plus featurettes on the truth behind the 300 Spartans, and how the actors built their characters.<br /><br />My favourite feature is the bluescreen picture-in-picture version of the movie. This is where you get to see how the movie was filmed (bluescreen background, etc.) in one window, while the final result plays in the other. It includes director Zack Snyder's commentary explaining the differences and how the scenes were created. When you see the amount of work that went into the movie, you'll definitely gain respect for its makers.<br /><br />Bottom-line<br /><br />This could be the title that makes people run out and buy HD-DVD players. If you already own one, pick this movie up and show all your friends what they're missing.<br /><br />300 (HD-DVD) **** (out of 5)<br />Rated R<br />Directed by Zack Snyder<br />Starring Gerard Butler, Lena Headeyes and how the scenes were created.

0380789035|3.0|A low level crim named Shadow, his adulterous girlfriend, now a zombie thanks to magic, and encounters with the decaying remnants of deities from many cultures.<br /><br />This started ok, then went nowhere, fairly quickly. This is obviously of interest to some, but maybe people who hadn't read a ton of mythology or things like that, anyway. It is not bad, just ho-hum, dead rotting girlfriend, big deal, please finish already, book, this is all too obvious. A definite disappointment from the hype and all that other stuff.<br /><br />It is not a bad book, as such, though.

0446693804|5.0|I'll admit, I didn't think I was in the mood for this type of story when I started reading it. And, when the author said that at first I would smile, then I would cry, I was more than determined to prove him wrong. OK, so he was right and I did cry. It was predictable and yet it still got to me. It is the story of a teenager coming of age in the fifties. Yet, in many ways it could be the story of a teenager today. Teenagers always try to fit in with the crowd and please their peers. A Walk to Remember is a quick, but memorable read.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I wondered what all the hype was about this movie. That is until I bought the Blu Ray version and watched it. It is now in the top 5 of my  Blu Ray collection. Great movie . I don't need nor do I want all the fluff the hd dvd offers for a additional cost. I want a great movie, period. That is what I received in the Blu Ray version.<br />Oh and as far as the so called grain is concerned, it is intentional on both formats.
6305364648|3.0|This was an ok movie. It holds your attention. Gives you the highs and lows.  Makes you care for the characters and the situations they are in.  The most redeming part of the whole film was where they were trying to trick arnie's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) by think that she was a spy and had her give her own husband a strip tease.  The best!  For all the right reasons.  but it did lack some pizazz, and some middle of the road special effects.  So overall it was something that would hold your attention and not be disappointed.
B000002B1M|5.0|This was when Nas began to lose his street cred due to some far fetched stories he was spittin, but lyrically this is one of the greatest works in hip hop history. Tracks like 'Take It In Blood' paint vivid wordplay that remains etched in your memory. There isn't a weak track on the album... A must have for any hip hop fan.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Elizabeth the First is one of my favorite historical figures. I think I've read and seen every book or flim about her. This flim is by far one the best I've seen. This flim gave her a hummanity a lot of flims have missed or choose not to portray. You were able to see her growth as not only a royal, but a person and a woman. You could see and feel how hard some of the choices she had to make were for her. I will watch this one over and over again.

0790729644|5.0|Unforgiven combines two major elements to make it the best Western ever made.  First is its brutally realistic depiction of violence and killing in the Old West.  Second is the situation of causing a reformed man to revisit the behavior of his past in order to survive.    There are no glorious killings in Unforgiven.  This movie lays to rest the notion of high-noon showdowns or fighting for honor.  Executions, ambushes, and agonizing gut-wounds are the staple methods of attack.  Alcohol, pride, and gold fuel most of the violence in the town of Big Whisky.  Most of the scenes with violence are very one-sided, further lending credence to this film.    The main character is almost certainly a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Through the efforts of his late wife, he has been able to eliminate his psychopathic tendencies, fueled for the most part by alcohol.  His sober days are blanched by regret and remorse over the people he has killed.  He is for all intents and purposes an unsuccessful farmer out trying to collect a bounty.  But when things go horribly wrong, he is forced to return to the behavior and actions of his past to survive.  A simple man with an extraordinary past and consequently extraordinary abilities.
0553213105|4.0|So many people - especially in the younger, 'trendier' generations, quite literally groan at the thought of reading a classic.  And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well.  They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel.  as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.<br /><br />This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else.  This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|What a breath taking movie...I've watched it 3 times now. Each time I see it, It continues to capitivate me. The magnificant portraying of the fighting skills of the 300 warriors are out of this world. To bad our military can't pick up on this kind of training!
B000QXDED6|1.0|Saw it at the theater. Memory dimmed my perceptions, so I rented it to \\"see if it was as bad\\" as I remembered. Yup. It was like going back to a restaurant with a big reputation because the first dinner you had there *couldn't* be that bad... but it was. And this movie blows gas...    I gave up about half-way through. The director and his crew must have combed every available history book for any and all quotes to insert as dialogue. What a stinker of a movie. It reminds me of the old serial TV westerns, with their focus on action, (remember the countless 10-minute bar fights in those old westerns?--this is more of that same, except with swords and macho one-liners spaced between the fights). Throw in a few grotesque graphics and costuming, and you've got Frank whatsisname's \\"genius\\". ZZZZZzzzzz..... LAME.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|The story of a callous and irredeemably nasty market trader, who has to go to Provence to take care of his late Uncle's Estate and finds the change of pace gradually melts his exterior.  It's not the most original of storylines, and in unlikely hands in the form of Ridley `Epic' Scott and Russell `Imposing' Crowe. Ridley Scott doing comedy has a slightly forced feel to it, none more so than when he has Crowe doing slapstick.  The scene with Crowe trying to get out of the pool goes on for just a bit too long to be comfortable, and watching Crowe falling about in the mud is somehow just not funny.  In addition, the plotline is slight, with the outcome never really in doubt.    Having said that, the screenplay has a lightness to the script which brings at the very least a smile - this may not be out and out comedy, but it is lighthearted enough to be entertaining.  The characters all have a touch of reality in an exaggerated form, which grounds the movie, albeit through a rosy lens filtered romantic haze.  If you are willing to just go with the flow, enjoy the scenery, the gorgeous cast and the languid pace, then you will be well enough rewarded with a lingering smile at the end.    This is really a 3 star movie, just elevated to 4 stars by a combination of Scott's lushly photographed scenery, and the charming flashbacks with Albert Finney as the uncle and Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the chocolate factory, Finding Neverland) as the young Max Skinner.  A Good Year won't be bothering Oscar any time soon and won't remain on anyone's top ten list - but it's a surprisingly effective change of pace for Scott and Crowe.

0385474547|2.0|While the story itself is useful in giving a student the right mindset for African studies, the story itself lacks much of the marvel of other historically-based books.  While the book is pointed towards lower-classmen in high school, the true audience should be college, where adults can completely analyze and idnetify the key points and emotions of the story.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell, who gave audiences the striking gender-bending musical \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\\" pushes boundaries again in \\"Shortbus.\\" The hype is true--there's hardcore sex, and lots of it, in this loose, improvisatory chronicle of several New Yorkers and their uncertain journeys through life. The bulk of what narrative there is centers around Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist who's never had an orgasm despite an ostensibly happy marriage, and Jamie and James (P J Deboy and Paul Dawson), a gay couple considering opening their relationship, who are secretly being stalked by their neighbor (Peter Stickles). They and several of their friends end up at Shortbus, which seems to be part nightclub, part sex club and part political discussion group. At first it's hard not to be caught up in the prurient thrill of seeing these people actually perform THOSE acts on film, but unlike hardcore pornography, where sex quickly palls due to its pointlessness, the sex in \\"Shortbus\\" enthralls because there is always an emotional purpose to it--these characters are doing it for a reason. Hence they earn the viewer's empathy and sympathy. As subversive in their way are scenes where a group of women talk about their best orgasms, or where a young gay man (the unbelievably beautiful Jay Brannan) has a conversation with the aged, wrinkled former Mayor of New York, totally as equals. The film does falter somewhat toward the end and the conflicts are resolved a mite hurriedly, but the overall impression remains. In an age where mainstream community standards do their best to suppress the sight of adults having consensual, joyful, and even funny sex, while condoning the ever more explicit depiction of all kinds of violence against the human body, \\"Shortbus\\" is a vivid protest against such topsy-turvy hypocrisy. The DVD includes a fascinating half-hour documentary narrated by Mitchell about the unusual creation process of \\"Shortbus,\\" a must-see. The rest can be dispensed with, although watching deleted scenes involving Stickles' character in an overtly political subplot confirms the filmmakers' ultimate decision to omit them.although watching deleted scenes involving Stickles' character in an overtly political subplot confirms the filmmakers' ultimate decision to omit them.

B000NA2776|1.0|Wow, where do I start?  First off, the Scissor Sisters is one of my favorite bands, and I feel like Mika is blatantly ripping them off, but has far less skills than they do.  His voice is so shrill and high-pitched it gets hard to listen to, and musically, I just can't find many interesting things about his music.  But that is after hearing the Scissor Sisters.  If you like Mika, be SURE to check them out!!!      After a while, I actually start thinking it's Miss Piggy singing - if you own this CD, listen to it and you'll see!!!  The song where he keeps repeating \\"Love me, love me\\" I always hear \\"Kermie, Kermie\\"  Sorry, this is probably rude, and I'm sure many people disagree with me, but I can't stand this CD.  It makes me want to kick my stereo in.  If you value your electronics and don't want to kick them in in a panic-induced rage, then don't buy this CD!

B000002UB3|3.0|I recieved this album promptly, brand new, & sealed in it's box. The disc, however, will not play on my computer. It plays just fine in my CD player, but my computer cannot read it using Media Player, itunes, or napster software. this leads me to suspect that the problem lies with the laser unit in my computer, but this is the only disc out of literally hundreds I have tried that my computer will not read. I find this very disappointing as I have now purchased this music twice (originally on vinyl), & still can't synch it to my MP3 player, through which I spend 90% of my listening time. My next plan is to have my son try it on his computer. If he can rip & burn it to a new disc, then perhaps my computer will read that disc. Any assistance you might offer would be appreciated.

I'm looking forward to reading the book, but I do wish I'd paid the few extra bucks to get the artwork.

B000035Z1Z|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! Her best work by far as well as Kevin Kline's. He is a very likable jerk who falls for her sweet innocence against his better judgement as he attempts to help her win back her \\"true love\\". Their chemistry is inspiring in a world of disposable lovers.
1596912375|5.0|In offering a review of a novel by William Boyd I could certainly be accused of bias. I would proudly plead guilty, since I regard him as one of just four or five British writers who are capable of constructing supreme works of fiction, written in a framework that is both informative and thought-provoking and all this set within a continuum of contemporary or historical events which themselves become re-interpreted by the fiction. In Restless, Boyd's latest novel, he has re-stated this ability and, if anything, written it larger via a smaller form.<br /><br />The historical element in Restless is supplied by the activities of an offshoot of World War Two intelligence. Ostensibly a private, dis-ownable initiative of a particular group, Boyd suggests that it formed an integral part of the British strategy, during the early part of the war, to force the United States to join the Allied effort. The fact, therefore, that it was undermined and subverted so that it perhaps aimed to achieve the opposite of its brief was probably par for the course when espionage meets its freelance counter, but the denouement is surprising and wholly credible.<br /><br />In front of this backdrop of fact meeting fiction, we have a landscape of human relationships. Ruth is a single mother in Oxford. She, herself, has had certain German connections, nay relations, hence the motherhood. She makes a living teaching English to foreign tutees, has several dubious visitors, dreams about completing an aging PhD and generally spends much of her time looking after a precocious five-year-old. And then her mother becomes someone quite unknown to her. The widow in the Oxfordshire retreat suddenly becomes part Russian, part English, with a French step-mother. She possessed several different identities before she became Mrs Gilmartin and most of these were fiction to provide cover for the others. How many of us, after all, can claim to have known our parents before they were parents?<br /><br />So, as Mrs Gilmartin the mother reveals to her daughter via instalments of an autobiography that she is really Eva Delectorskaya, recruited in Paris to conduct a campaign of wartime disinformation in the United States, the complications of life  gradually attain the status of the mundane. Recruited, perhaps, because she was rootless and thus expendable, Eva proved herself intellectually and operationally superior to her manipulative managers and survived the posting that was supposed to achieve their subverted ends and, at the same time, erase her potential to supply evidence. Many years later, Eva, now Mrs Gilmartin, feels the need to get even, to expose the double or triple-cross for what it was and deliver at least a prod to the comfortable, self-congratulatory but traitorous British establishment that ran her. Daughter Ruth becomes the means.<br /><br />So one messy life tries to tie up its soggy ends via the actions of another who is apparently yet to attain the same depths of complication. And she succeeds. The fright is delivered. The memory that Eva, the mother, was fundamentally brighter than the upper class Brits who were trying to manipulate her is rekindled. Her training was perfect, but she went beyond it and the plan backfired, irrelevantly as it turned out because greater events intervened. But years later, Eva, Mrs Gilmartin, is still brighter than her boss and, through her daughter's efforts, she brings a special kind of justice to bear on the double-dealer who ruined, but also perhaps made her life.<br /><br />In characteristically humble terms, William Boyd reminds us at the end that we are all watched, all awaiting the cupboard to reveal its skeleton, but in our more mundane lives, it is unlikely to be as colourful an event as that which Eva Delectorskaya, Mrs Gilmartin, and her daughter Ruth uncover.<br /><br />Philip Spires<br />Author of \\"Mission\\"veals to her daughter via instalments of an autobiography that she is really Eva Delectorskaya, recruited in Paris to conduct a campaign of wartime disinformation in the United States, the complications of life  gradually attain the status of the mundane.

B0000AZAUM|3.0|David Bowie has been my favorite recording artist for over thirty years. I went through two RCA Ziggy LPs on vinyl, owned the Mobile Fidelity half speed master recording, and prior to this release, have owned three different CD releases. Make no mistake, \\"Ziggy\\" is one of my all time favorite recordings. I had incredibly high hopes for this SACD and have to admit, I am sorely disappointed by the sound quality and the surround mix. Always a little on the \\"thin\\" side as a rock LP, the bass on the SACD is almost nonexistent. There is no punch in the rock numbers at all. Yes, there is a clarity to the vocals that is superior to previous releases, but the music itself lacks the presence which, in my mind's eye, this recording deserves.    A recent convert to the SACD format, I hate to report that this release, though one of my favorites in terms of music, is the one I return to least because of the sound quality. I would blame it on my stereo system if the other SACDs I have didn't sound so good. I hope they release more of Bowie's catalog in this format ( please - Station to Station), but do a better job in delivering a great sounding product. Bowie's music deserves better.
B000RJO578|5.0|'Hot Fuzz' reunites the 'Shaun of the Dead' gang: Lead/co-writer Simon Pegg; director/co-writer Edgar Wright; and the hilarious sidekick Nick Frost. It's hard to say which is funnier. This one has a bit tighter story, but it's basically up to whether you find mocking American ammo-loaded buddy flicks or zombie movies.   In 'Fuzz,' Pegg plays Nick Angel, an uptight cop married to his job (with a bit of love saved for his Peace Lily). Angel is so good at his job that he gets 'promoted' to sergeant, but booted out of London to a tiny picturesque hamlet that's won tons of awards for its quaintness and charm. Sounds like a crap assignment for a hard-edged cop, but something sinister lurks beneath the surface.   In this village are a host of memorable characters reside, cheery innkeepers, smart alecky cops, a great Jim Broadbent as police chief always chowing on sweets, Frost as his well-meaning but none-too-brilliant son Danny  Butterman, Timothy Dalton is to-die-for as grocery store owner, positively dripping with sleaziness with a scenery-chewing glint in his eye. Edward Woodward is hilarious as the head of the neighborhood watch, with cameras perched all over town, his group fretting over the human statue and jugglers and kids in hoodies. Amidst all this strange deaths begin happening: The theatre director/actor (butchering Shakespeare like you wouldn't believe) and his bit of tail (with a horrid laugh) have an unfortunate accident; a nosy reporter meets an unfortunate end in a death that's reminiscent of 'The Omen,' the refrigerator magnate (get it?) dies in a horrible explosion and on and on. Only Angel believes that these are connected and aren't accidents, and he's a man on fire to find out. Unfortunately all the chief wants him to do is track down a swan who's flown the coop.   There are great touches from 'The Wicker Man' here and many more greats filling out roles as the townsfolk. The conclusion (I won't give away what is at the heart of it) but it's absolutely hilarious and totally absurd.
B000M343BM|5.0|This is a really good fun movie I could watch again and again. Love all these stars and the script is timeless.
B000002KD9|5.0|I was in a bar down South after losing my brother to a long extended illness..just trying to forget what was going on with my life but not being able to let go of something deep down inside..me and a friend trying to drink our way to heaven..the jukebox came on with AFTER THE GOLD RUSH..sometimes a song just hits you in the gut and you know that everything is going to be all right..Neil's music has a way of touching you in the gut and this album should be in any Neil Young fan's collection..
B000NA1OXY|2.0|Yes indeed Ladies and Gentlemen this has been another exciting episode of BRAT ROCK. The band itself is superb but the lyrics are left wanting with all the foul expletives and uber snotty attitude.  Well I guess we should not throw everything out, but not all things can be saved with slick marketing and a set of professional handlers.  Hey Avril what happened to your original band--those guys gave you an edge.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I admit I bought this because 1) I needed something else to get free shipping on HP 7, and 2) I needed something I could listen to at work on my iPod that isn't by the Beatles. I already recieved Long Way Home as a gift a while back, and figured this would be more of the same relaxing stuff. But, once I popped the CD for a quick listen on the way home one day, the wonderful piano music and lyrics made this not only a relaxing listen, but one I keep coming back to almost every day. I love the title track, and admit I sing along full volume in my car on the way home from work. Okay, and push repeat several times as well. After a while, a few of the songs wear on you (Lonestar and Painter being the two I now routinely skip due to the less-than-stellar lyrics), but most are jazzy, meaningful, and well worth the purchase.
B000001ESP|5.0|A great CD of the 80's . fine musicians and so powrefull . great for the technical rock fan and musician alike.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|THE PAINTER...if you follow every dream you might get lost..I keep my friends eternally..we leave our tracks in the sounds..some of them are with me now..some of them can't be found...<br />Prairie Wind just could be my favorite Neil Young and I have quite a Neil Young collection, maybe it's just the magic of the lyrics..it's as if Neil and I have travelled the same road..but really it's the work of a legend and a master, one who can touch you 30 years ago and then again move you today as well as he did then..and never sell out his integrity in music..no Vegas act for Neil Young just soul-touching, memorable music.
B000ROALCG|4.0|FANTASTIC CD, MARC ROCKS. THE MOVIE IS GREAT JLO AND MARC DID AN AWESOME JOB. TOO BAD THE CRITICS BASHED THE MOVIE. THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE WILL BRING CHILLS UP AND DOWN YOUR BACK.
B000QXDED6|5.0|this is the best action movie of 2007. it was way better than die hard, and a lot better than spider man wich sucked!
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I love this album, I have always been an Alan Parsons fan, even the new versions of older songs are great.  I regret however to hear a loud noise, and  the sound engineer telling someone to \\"Be careful, I'm recording!... RECORDING!!!\\"  (heard in spanish, minute 1:37).  The album deserves 5 stars, minus 1 for the engineer's lack of professionalism.
1594489505|5.0|I hesitated to purchase the book.  I thought it would be a \\"blame the U.S. for everything\\" story.  But I was wrong.  It doesn't.  It is a powerful story about ordinary Afghan people (2 women are the main characters) who live through the turmoil and oppression as one muslim radical group after another take over the government.  I highly recommend it.
B000NA77YO|5.0|I have never done this before, but I must give credit where credit is due.  I have more than 1,300 cds in my collection, and this is without a doubt one of the finest I have ever heard.  I probably listened to it 15-20 times in the 4-6 weeks after my purchase.  It really is a masterpiece.  I am not really into typing, and see no need to type three pages and review every song here.  I saw the group at Radio City Music Hall NY in March, going to see them again at Jones Beach In September.  Ronnie James Dio is one of the best in the business, right up there with Halford (Judas Priest), Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Plant (Zeppelin), Cornell (Soundgarden) and Astbury (The Cult).  They have some new tracks on this collection that are just as good as the old ones.  This disc will make you all but forget about Ozzy Osbourne.  He is good, but he is no Ronnie James Dio.  An argument can easily be made, that these tracks are better than the Ozzy-era tunes as well.  No classic hard rock collection would be complete without this disc.
0767903862|5.0|I didn't know much about Bill Bryson except that he had written A Short History of Nearly Everything (which had nearly bored me to tears, the first time I tried to read it), but I gave this book a chance and I am so glad I did.<br />I think Bill Bryson is just about the funniest man alive. I was laughing so hard I was in tears more than a few times. I also really enjoy the history he gave about Australia.<br />Bill Bryson is one of my very favorite authors because of this book.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|The 1973 Jayston/Cussack version is my favourite, owing to its faithfulness to the tone and language of the book. This one does have its merits - mainly in its appeal to a modern audience. It's a very 'physically' oriented adaptation - sensuous and striking visually. I do have some issues with it. There are several aspects - I believe that Jane, as Adele's governess, would have cured, at least somewhat, her nauseating preening and dancing and attention seeking. I realize that Jane had been terribly squelched as a child, and may not have wished to do the same to Adele - but Jane seemed too indulgent. How many times do we need to witness Adele 'sashaying' in front of the guests? It made me squirm! Mr. Rochester being such a 'naturalist' and scientist also seemed a liberty and an unnecessary one. Yes he travelled, and yes, in the novel he draws Jane's attention to a particular species of insect - but it became boring after awhile and didn't advance the action very much. Yes, Jane learned much from Mr. Rochester, but the content of this learning should have been secondary to their minds being in sympathy with each other. That, in my opinion, is more important. I also felt the twins - as being symbolic for this connection felt between Rochester and Jane - were a rather obvious and clumsy simile. I felt, overall, that the religious thread {which was pointed out earlier} was lacking. I enjoyed the erotic scene of Jane and Edward lying together after the wedding was called off - but I'm not sure it would have happened. In the novel, Jane's main objection to living with Edward without marriage is that she would be 'owned' by him - a mistress - not an equal. This is also downplayed. I think these omissions, and the introduction of these physical scenes 'sans' marriage, make Jane, arguably, too physical a character. Jane's character is loftier than that; her sense of honour and duty and self-denial are paramount. I think these qualities could have been blended better. If Cussack in the 1973 version is too cerebral, Wilson,  is too physical. Stephens is good as Rochester - a little too young and a little too handsome, perhaps. He masks his good looks with a physical coarseness and an ungainly gait. He lacks Jayston's deep, primal misery and moodiness, however. He seems more bothered by a toothache than soul-tortured. Despite these personal objections, I found this movie to be very watchable and satisfying - almost from a point of, \\"how will this adaptation be different from the others?\\" There was much more 'right' with this movie than 'wrong' but I think that purists, and those who love the novel, may find it falls a little flat.
B00005JPLW|5.0|...and I'm especially looking at you, movie critics. While \\"300\\" wasn't completely accurate in terms of military history, the spirit of the Spartans, their culture, and the essence of this battle were 100% accurate. Herodotus and other contemporary Greek historians took the point of Thermopylae and its significance immediately at the time of the battle: Thermopylae was the first place in history where men died for freedom. More, they CHOSE to die for freedom and understood exactly what their sacrifice meant.     Because director Zack Snyder stayed true to Frank Miller's graphic novel, all of Miller's research into the historical battle appeared in the movie. At the Persians' demand for earth and water, which were tokens of submission to the Persian empire, the Athenians killed the messengers. The Spartans threw the messengers down the well and told them, \\"dig it out for yourselves.\\"    The lines critics derided as over-the-top or too jingoistic are lines recorded by Herodotus in his histories. When the Persians told the Spartans to lay down your weapons, the Spartans shouted back, \\"Come and take them!\\" The caustic response to the Persians' threat that their arrows would blot out the sun was indeed, \\"Good, then we shall fight in the shade.\\" That's black humor that is part of the military ethos to this day.    While not elucidated in the movie--and this could be termed a failing, though I don't think it was a particularly crucial point--the reason the Spartans fought at Thermopylae was to hold back the Persian advance until other Greek city-states had time to rally their forces. 300 Spartans, aided by 700 Thespians and 900 helots (serfs of Sparta) held back the Persians for three days. When their spears broke, they used their swords. When their swords broke, they used their nails and teeth. The tenacity, ferocity, and courage of the Spartans is why we still know their names today; their sacrifice is the reason the western world exists. If the Spartans had failed at Thermopylae, the Greek ideas of democracy, freedom, and republicanism (primitive though they were) would have died in the cradle. Because of the Spartans, those ideas passed to Rome, and then to Europe. We are the inheritors of the Spartan's sacrifice.    That so many critics and moviegoers could so badly misconstrue the meaning of this movie, ignore the courage of the Spartans and the historical significance of this battle speaks to the state of western education systems and exactly how badly devalued freedom and courage are in our modern world. To deride the Spartan's warrior culture as \\"Nazi-ish\\" and their bon mots as jingoistic is to be utterly ignorant of the fact that they REALLY SAID THOSE THINGS. They meant them. They're not propaganda courtesy of a modern Goebbels, as one critic said, and the people that loved the movie weren't \\"seig-heiling\\" outside the theater, as another criminally ignorant critic said.    If you want to see the Spartans of today, look at the US Marine Corps. I was fortunate enough to see this movie in the theater, a screening for Marines who were going to deploy the next day. The black humor, defiance in the face of death, spirit of self-sacrifice, and gut understanding that freedom IS purchased with blood, as Queen Gorga noted in the movie, is all part of our modern military, and thank God it is. Without modern-day Spartans, the critics who make so free with their ignorance would never have the freedom to spout it. If you left the theater or walked away from your DVD player thinking this was just a blood-spattered action flick, you missed the point entirely.    The movie itself is beautiful, hyper-real, and while Gerard Butler's Scottish accent escaped on occasion, the acting was for the most part flawless. For those complaining that the film was \\"gay\\"....you DO know that Greeks fought in the nude, don't you? That the heroic nude is a cornerstone of the art world? And the same visual hyper-reality that was used for sets and battle-scenesapplied to the bodies of the actors themselves. The actors are no less works of art than the slow motion battle scenes. The body of a warrior, the motion of battle, has been captured in artwork more frequently than almost any other subject matter. Zack Snyder was following in a tradition that began even before Classical Greece.    The visual hyper-reality of the film applied to dialogue and plot: Frank Miller wasn't attempting to recreate the battle of Thermopylae as a documentary. The plot is simple because the idea at the heart of it is simple. Freedom isn't free. Expanding on the political situation or battle strategizing would've overshadowed that beautifully simple idea. The history channel had any number of documentaries about Sparta and Thermopylae at the time 300 was in theaters; watch those if you want a detailed sketch of how opposition to the Persians originally gathered around Athens and Sparta, and that a congress met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC to form a confederate alliance of Greek city-states.     Historical movies don't have to be documentaries, and the success of 300 is proof of that idea. The great concepts don't have to be diluted in melodrama and politically correct casting choices. Maybe the movie critics would have preferred a story where Queen Gorga went out to fight with the Spartans and outshone her husband; never mind historical accuracy, it would've been more politically correct. Perhaps it would've been better if Zack Snyder explained that Xerxes' father called him names when he was a child, so we could sympathize with the Persians' attempt to invade and conquer Greece. Maybe Leonidas should've had a gay lover to flesh out his character.    Maybe the critics should learn their history before they try to critique another movie.
B00005MP58|4.0|I can only echo what others have written - both praise and censure! This adaptation is very faithful to the novel and omits nothing - which is good if one hasn't read the novel, and a little condescending if one has. There are subtler ways of expounding upon ones poverty without Mrs. Bennet shrieking about it, Lizzy and Jane talking about it, and Mr. Bennet tallying up his expense sheet with a worried expression! Some aspects are over-explained to us ignorant, contemporary audiences! Mrs. Bennet is over-the-top to the extent that one can only wonder 'what arts of allurement' she used on Mr. Bennet! Jane, I'm sorry to say, is so plain, that to hear her spoken of as 'five times prettier' than the rest of the Bennet girls, is just upsetting! Lizzy has too much makeup on, and seems, as said before, much older than 20. There is little chemistry between Jane and Bingley and Mary is too ugly. The Bingley sisters are a little over-acted - such acid can burn with smaller doses!    That all being said, there is much to praise. Darcy's character is well drawn - he seems, at times,  to be struggling more with shyness and confusion than superiority. You do feel that Lizzy's 'first impression' of him, though warranted, is wrong, and you can thoroughly understand her change of heart. The look that he gives her when she goes to Georgiana's aid at the piano when the awful topic of Wickham is introduced, is one of my favourite movie moments! Lizzy, though too made up and too old, has a spirit that is true to the novel - although, as before mentioned, seems, at times, a little more smug than playful and independent. Wickham's dealings with the Darcy family are excellently explained and integrated into the movie.    I love the look of this adaptation and the more physical side of life it portrays. It's brighter and noisier than other adaptations - hair is blown and children run and the roads are muddy and the women don't always have perfect posture. The characters are approachable, lively, and generally believable.     Worth watching and worth owning.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|For those fans who didn't like this album as much as his first two, I have to say at first I agreed with you...but then this album grew on me. Really grew on me.  Josh is really trying a few new things...stretching himself as an artist and his voice is only getting better.  His collaboration efforts on this album are phenomenal, especially \\"Weeping.\\"  For anyone who gave this less than 5 stars, keep listening!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I love Roger Waters and David Gilmour for different reason but to come on here to Amazon and write reviews on anything involving David Gilmour in such a manner is insane. Why attack Polly?......I think maybe your wife is not that good looking and you are pissed at David for having a hot younger wife. You go eat more cheeseburgers so you can put California where it should be IN THE WATER. As for this release I am pumped for it and the only thing I agree with BRADLEY on is that IN THE FLESH from Waters is just an incredible DVD.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Love Actually is somewhat sweet romantic comedy. I like the story between Hugh Grant and his tea lady and Laura Linney and her much younger beau but the rest of the stories were tepid. Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley ruin this movie, over-rated and stuffy actors who make little or no impression whatsoever. And those stupid scenes with those adult film performers really make this film feel forced. Love Actually is more about lust and misunderstanding than love. This one you can skip.
1594489505|5.0|I was a little cautious of rushing to read this book since I had enjoyed the Kite Runner so much, and second books are rarely as good as the first.  This book was every bit as good as the Kite Runner--and maybe even a bit better.  A captivating story of the strength and unlikely love of two women trapped in a terrible situation in Afghanistan, this is an excellent read.
B000NA1Z1A|4.0|Great CD. I like the focus on the vocals rather than a synthesized background or overly aggressive mixes. The rap part on one track is the only arguable blot on an otherwise idyllic landscape! But hey, if Blondie could do it with Rapture, then why not Winehouse?

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Who doesn't know that all too familiar theme music? You could be in a shopping mall somewhere and you hear that low-pitched string instrument playing its evil lament... Images of a ravenous shark devouring unsuspecting swimmers are going to be evoked.<br /><br />The movie is timeless and is a prime example of a good scare without being TOO bloody. For its time, of course, this was a rather gory film, but by today's standards (With Scream and Saw and all those movies) this one is tame by comparison.<br /><br />But blood and guts aside, this movie is just downright frightening!<br /><br />Like the tagline says... \\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...\\"<br /><br />There's nothing like the feeling of helplessness and JAWS plays on that feeling of helplessness all too well!<br /><br />Not really sure there is anything on this disk that makes it worth a \\"special edition\\" but the movie itself is worth the price I paid!

Everything that has been said probably has been said, but I've got two cents to throw in: \\"Magic\\" and \\"From a Lover to a Friend\\" are as fine as anything Paul McCartney has ever written post-Beatles. I'm not saying that there is nothing else worth hearing on here, but these two rise above to the stratospheric level this man used to reach in his sleep and now struggles mightily to attain. Somehow he found it on these two, both rich in beauty, with lovely, longing melodies, arrangements, great, great bass playing, voice, everything you love about Paul in the best of his latter years arrives in these two songs.

B00003CXD0|5.0|This is a great story and the actors do it justice.  I can watch it again and again.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Since this movie was released, I wanted to see it and now I finally did. I am very happy that I was this movie because of the plot and all of the twists. I will say that I do love this era and time period. The competition of the magicians are what really makes this movie and the illusions that are presented. It did take a \\"dramatic\\" turn near the end and it is the ending that you do not expect. I am a fan of both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. I think that they are both excellent actors and in this one did an excellent job. This is a must see for anyone that likes \\"movies with twists\\". I highly recommend it!!!
B000EGFVQS|3.0|About the novel:      Susie Salmon, age 14, is dispatched to \\"her heaven\\" by a serial killer, after being lured to his underground lair, raped, strangled, and dismembered.  I was amused by the direct, matter-of-fact way that she describes the ensuing events (\\"that man has no shame.\\"), and that's what got me interested.  But I do love irony!    Susie's heavenly life consists mainly of watching the earthly lives of her family and friends. Along with that, she has the ability to \\"see\\" people's thoughts and intentions.  Thus it seems that she \\"lives\\" through them, and THE LOVELY BONES is her narration of what happens in the next 10 years. The story has some good parts, and the characters are interesting, but it does drag on a bit at times.      I liked the family, especially the father, and I liked the way that they came together at the end.  The violent death of a child must have an incredible impact on a family--which we do see here--but they mostly seem real in how they deal with the loss.  I was not above being touched by the love and care they had for one another (except for the mother, who has to deal with her own loss of self/identity), and that they do re-unite.  But I did think that the Ruth/Suzie body thing at the end was silly and unnecessary.    Intended audience: this book is easy to read, and would be good for young people--as a cautionary--or grown people who like novels which are not necessarily \\"Literature\\".  Written with empathy.    About the book (hardback edition, 2002):  The prices listed here--$3.00-$5.00 or so seem fair for this book, since the paper is not high-quality and tends to yellow. The print is decent and legible.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This movie was very much like The Butterfly Effect and Sliding Doors in which it made you think, what if you could change something in your past. But this movie takes it a little farther. It comes in the crime scenario and a detective that wants to solve a crime that \\"was\\" committed 4 days previous. I thought that this movie was very well done and it does take you into the realm of \\"possibilities\\". This movie was cast perfectly for the characters and the story was a solid one. I highly recommend this one to anyone that loves detective movies with a twist.
0385513755|4.0|I received this impressive illustrated edition of \\"The Code\\" as a Christmas gift back when it first came out.  I had been working very diligently on my master's degree in German literature at the time, so I was totally ready to while away the break with some light-reading.  So what if it was not prize winning literature--- except for the obvious French phrases sprinkled throughout the book-- it was in English!  And it had PICTURES!  I had done enough Thinking during the semester (and I mean, seriously, Thinking is overrated, don't you think?)  So just let \\"Prof.\\" Dan Brown's words spoon feed his windy plot to you, and his illustrations lead you step-by-step through Europe. The pictures of cathedrals, the Louvre, and so forth which accompany the text are beautiful and they really make the experience. The places are real, but \\"the DiVinci Code\\" is just for fun.<br /><br />Enjoy!

6302759110|1.0|I'm sorry, but what was this mess? Was it a \\"penny dread\\" melodrama, a comedy,a spoof....what it was not was \\"Bram Stoker's\\" novel for sure! I had every intention of being dazzled and well-involved with this film starring a well-known cast and top director (Coppola) and Executive Producer (Michael Apted). Upon getting into the film I started to feel amused at just how ridiculous the whole movie was, and I started to actually wonder if this was meant to be a serious and faithful rendering of Stoker's book, or was this intended to simply gross me out with wooden acting, bad dialogue and some of the most inane makeup and special effects that I have ever seen? I still am not sure what the final intention was, but I can firmly say that this was not the book, and it was terrible.Style (if that is what you want to call what we have here!) cannot win out over substance! Gorgeous costumes (really?), and supposedly great set design (it looked like community theatre) simply cannot, in my mind, make up for terrible acting (Ryder and Reeves accents and line delivery is positively laughable) and a story so far removed from what was supposed to be Bram Stoker's. The film should have been called simply COPPLOLA'S DRACULA and  not give any credit to Stoker. Stoker would have declined any connection to this film!.That aside, the film is overblown, pretentious and does not succeed in scaring or creating any suspense.The story is as chopped up as any screenplay I have yet to see (James Hart wrote HOOK...hmmm!).A truly major disappointment despite any Awards it may have received.Cannot be recommended in the slightest. I will give anyone my copy who wants it as long as you pay for the shipping!
038533348X|1.0|This book is a total disappointment. One of the worst books I have ever read. His \\"humor\\" is on idiotic level and the book in general is schizophrenic. Only thing Vonnegut achieved is to annoy me; this is the first book in my life that I threw into the garbage.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|To tell the truth, I had already seen most of the videos from this DVD on youtube, but I still wanted to own the entire DVD.  When I saw that it had finally come out for NTSC format, I almost couldn't believe my eyes.  And the price is a steal!  Anyway, so I bought it, thinking worst case scenario, I wouldn't be able to watch it on our TV.  Well, I had no reason to worry...so anyone who's holding out on purchasing this because they're worried about it playing on NTSC, there's no need to fear!  On to the video itself.  The concert footage is excellent.  It's obvious that Nightwish puts on a great show...or at least they did with Tarja (we have yet to see how they do with Anette).  The sound is very clear, their performance itself was spectacular, the picture is perfect.  Just watching the concert alone makes it worth the price, which is good because the special features aren't all that great.  The set includes a documentary, which was horribly boring because either it doesn't come with subtitles, or I'm just not smart enough to find them.  Either way, most of the documentary was in Finnish or Spanish...I could pick out words here and there, but that's about it.  It does have concert pics on it though, and that's pretty cool.  LOTS of them, too!  I'm not a big fan of live CD's, so I haven't really listened to them a whole lot, but they're pretty good from what I DID hear of them.  I'd highly recommend this to any Nightwish fan.  It makes a great addition to my Nightwish collection!
B000MXPE74|4.0|These guys are adorable.  I bought this cd after seeing them for the first time at Lollapalooza.  I had not even heard them before.  They were the first band on the first morning and all I could think was, \\"Wow, if this is the first group, this is going to be an incredible 3-day gig.\\"  Their music if light and fun and you find yourself singing along to the choruses after just one listen.  \\"Baby Fratelli\\" is definitely the sing-as-loud-as-you-can-in-the-car song but every track on this cd is good.  Speaking as a 50+-year-old I highly recommend to all power pop/punk pop fans.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|I don't know why everyone whines about copy protection but whatever. If you know what your doing you can get the song on your PC. Anyway, this is the best Foo album yet. C'mon, you get 2 full length discs for the price of one, what's to complain about? Disc 1, the rock disc, contains great songs and the progression from beginning to end is great. Well done! The acoustic side showcases the Foo's stripped down and raw. It shows how great these guys are as musicians with minimal sound effects. If you don't like it don't listen to it. The material is great. This is some of the finest to come out from the Foo's. I cannot keep this album out of my CD player. Bravo to Dave and crew for their finest work yet. Its' epic! Rock on!
0440241413|2.0|I like to read some fluffy chick lit now and then so I though this book fit the bill. Honestly, I couldn't stand the main character and I found myself rooting for her and her terrible credit to go down in flames. I just couldn't find anything likeable about her.
B0000E64TR|5.0|I really don't have much new to add to what the others who have reviewed this CD have already said. but trust me: the SACD is absolutely wonderful. I got it in the mail the other day and listened to the entire CD, and the fidelity and surround mix enhance the music greatly. This and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" are now my demo discs when people want to hear what SACD can do for a record. I wish that all SACDs of classic LPs sounded this great. If you have an SACD player, you NEED this disc.

0618477942|5.0|This was one of the most engaging and crushingly sad books I've ever read. Most authors are unable to write about agonizing personal history without being mawkish or manipulative.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who just appreciates good music. I caught a sneak preview of this amazing disc on my local PBS station in August of 2007, and it was one of the greatest things I had seen on television in a long time. Johnny Cash's prime time television show aired from 1969 - 1971, and featured both prominent rock and country artists of the day. Groundbreaking television for sure, considering at the time that most rock artists were associated with the peace, drugs, free love and the anti-war movement by a conservative segment of American society, just when the war was really starting to sour. Filmed live at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee (with a few exceptions), in front of a mostly Southern country music audience, all the artists seemed to be warmly embraced by the crowd, with Johnny Cash's blessing and support. The first hour consisted of rock and popular music performers that Johnny Cash was an admirer or fan of, including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Neil Young, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Neil Diamond, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. The highlight was Derek and the Dominoes featuring Eric Clapton, and following their performance none other than Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash himself joined Derek and the Dominoes onstage for a raucous version of Perkins' Matchbox. Simply amazing.   The second half was Johnny himself performing solo, with his wife June Carter Cash, and with the Tennessee Three. Prominent country artists also featured were George Jones, Tammy Wynette, a young, short-haired and beardless Hank Williams Jr., young Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, and Charley Pride (possibly the only black country artist ever). These are only the performances shown on the PBS special preview. There were literally hundreds of great performances on this show over its two year run. There's no lip synching nonsense here. Every artist actually performing and singing live. This is priceless television and Iwould highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any of the artists I mentioned. You will not be disappointed. It won't be available until September of 2007, and I will most definitely be purchasing it.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger Than Fiction is smart without being sarcastic, thoughtful without being dull, uplifting without being saccharine.  It runs a wambly course from goofy through ominous to downright surreal - but never loses track of its humanity.  Viewers will recall Being John Malkovich and Adaptation - but it's better than both, especially the latter.  While those movies were self-consciously clever, pointing incessantly at the man behind the curtain - Stranger Than Fiction plays it straight, and we are the beneficiaries.  Indeed, there is a calm, sweet reserve to this movie, all the performances are understated and nobody is winking at the camera.<br /><br />This film makes me want to see Will Ferrell in more dramatic parts; his touching innocence sets the tone effectively.  Ferrell is surrounded by acting royalty - Emma Thompson is painfully convincing as a neurotic writer, Dustin Hoffman \\"channels\\" an English professor, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is even more irresistible than usual (saying something).  Indeed, the movie-within-a-movie love story between Ferrell and Gyllenhaal is a real standout - such genuine romanticism, sensitively handled, is rare in film today.  A pleasure seeing Linda Hunt again, however briefly.  Latifah, by contrast - and her character - (a \\"fixer\\" for stuck writers - in today's publishing industry? - please!) are equally implausible and useless.<br /><br />Marc Foster directs this film with extraordinary confidence, allowing it to develop at a leisurely pace.  It sits neatly between two other films of his, Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland - one a grim descent into the hungry heart of man - the other, a flight into fantasy.  While the premise of Stranger Than Fiction is certainly surreal, the tone is ultimately all too human, it's the personal character we notice, not the gadget.  Of course, the movie is not without its dry humor, especially in its commentary on the relationship between art and responsibility.  Perhaps only an actor of Dustin Hoffman's caliber could explain to Harold - without irony - that he needs to die because it's in the best interests of Kay's book - and after all - the book is a masterpiece.<br /><br />All the people in this film - (unlike so many movie characters) - have ideals and value systems - even the ironically named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) with her rather loopy view of selective, socially defensible taxation.  As the film develops, their value systems brush against each other but do not collide and crash.  And in the end, even when the film violates its own rules, (the rules we have begrudgingly been persuaded to accept), you will forgive it.  Because by then none of these people are characters at all, they're just nice people, and you want them to win.  An exceptional film.uld explain to Harold - without irony - that he needs to die because it's in the best interests of Kay's book - and after all - the book is a masterpiece.

0345494997|5.0|No matter your allegiance to the narcissistic genius who was Frank Lloyd Wright, it is Mamah Cheney who will mesmerize you with her intelligence, sensitivity and straightforward innocence. To dare to write such a complicated true story and to succeed so masterfully is a feat few authors can achieve. Nancy Horan is a remarkably gifted writer who brings you close to the complex love affair between Mamah and Frank and grips you with her elqouent prose. I have not enjoyed a book as much in a very long time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to dive into an extremely satisfying novel and not emerge from its spell until you turn the last page.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Yeah, this is another 5 star album from Bob (all of his are 5 stars).  The only thing I would say about this is that if you are going to spend the money to buy this, you're probably wanting A LOT of Bob Marley.  I would recommend getting his studio albums first (Catch A Fire, Burnin', Natty Dread, Rastaman Vibration, Exodus, Kaya, Survival, Uprising, and Confrontation).  After you have those you may want to get some live Marley, so check out Live at the Roxy and Babylon By Bus.  Finally, if you still need more Bob, get this box set.  It has a lot of rare stuff on it that you'll definitely enjoy if you like all of those other albums.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige is an interesting film, buoyed more by the stars than the script.  I really enjoyed it; have viewed it several times, but I come away from the movie feeling like I've experienced a slight of hand, just like the magic they perform.  The wonderful, enduring Michael Caine - always a favourite who could lure me into watching him read a phone book -- gives a strong performance, as usual, as the magical engineer behind Hugh Jackman's Rufus Angier.  Jackman's beautiful, wonderful, so the movie's success rest heavily on his performance, and he does well in the lead.  Christian Bale as his rival is rather flat, but that could be the script more than his acting as Alfred Borden (but then, I always think this about his performances!).  And the White Lord Ziggy, David Bowie, puts in a guest spot that is interesting, but again a bit of waste of his talent.  Even a cameo from Daniel Davis.<br /><br />The movie centres around Jackman's Angier and Bale's Border.  Angier is the master showman.  He has the beauty and grace to set up a trick, which is more than half of it's success.  Border is more the thinking man's magician.  He can figure out his own tricks, but is lousy at presenting them, until rivalry pushes both men into obsession.  They were once friends, but after the death of Jackman's wife in the water tank trick, they became enemies, each trying to out do the other, and taking it way past a rivalry, unto nothing else really matters to them.  They lose friends, lovers, and ultimately rush to destruction - of themselves and each other.<br /><br />Very interesting film, one worth watching again.  But I still fill like the whole film is one big trick, just like the magic they perform.  Misdirection - great cast, beautifully filmed, but covering up what they don't want you too see, that it's a bit more flash than substance.
B00005MKA1|5.0|If there was only one Bob Marley album that I could have (heaven forbid) this would be it.  I bought this when I was vacationing in Spain in 2003, and everytime I hear it I'm still reminded of sitting on the beaches next to the Mediterranean Sea.  This album is special to me, but any Bob Marley fan will thoroughly enjoy it.  Bob redid a number of songs from his Studio One days (Kaya, Sun Is Shining, Satisfy My Soul, Smile Jamaica) and also brought a lot of new classics to the table (Easy Skanking, Is This Love, Misty Morning, Running Away, Time Will Tell).  I love every song on here and I never skip a song.  Don't miss out.  Buy it now.
1594489505|5.0|I loved both books by this author.  The Afghan setting is realy exposed in these two dramatic stories.
B00005KB9R|5.0|This is the original Wailers in peak form (along with the Catch A Fire album).  It's also the last studio album ever recorded by the super-group that included Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer all on vocals.  Each of them takes the lead vocals on different songs (none of the three bonus tracks have Bob on lead vocals), and every song is a masterpiece.  If you like anything by Bob Marley, you won't be disappointed with this album.  One thing to consider is whether or not you want the rare songs on the Deluxe Edition of this album or not, because if you want a COMPLETE Bob Marley collection, you should get that.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|When I saw Grindhouse in the theater I was thrilled! It was such a good time and totally reflected the feel of the old double features with the trailers and such. The WHOLE package is what made this experience fun and I totally \\"got\\" what the directors intended (though I am guessing that many people did not \\"get it\\" since box office numbers were low)! Now they are releasing the films separately? What are they thinking? I do believe that each movie on its own is fun and worth watching but I thought the whole point of releasing Grindhouse originally was to replicate the feel of going to the movies in the 70's! When I was leaving the theater the first thing I said is that I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD. And now I am disappointed! Personally, if they released both Death Proof and Planet Terror singly AND released a disc as it was shown in the theater, I would buy all three! I am THAT MUCH of a fan of these films but to not even offer the option to see the film (Grindhouse, not Death Proof or Planet Terror) as the directors intended on DVD is a travesty!
B00005MKA3|5.0|Buy this album.  You know Bob Marley doesn't disappoint.  This probably shouldn't be your first Bob Marley album, though, as Catch A Fire and Burnin' are probably the best introductions to Bob' music.  However, if this is your first Bob album, you won't be disappointed.  I would list my favorite songs on the album but I just love them all.  Get this album and be happy.
B00005JMXX|4.0|If you look at this from the point of view of a film connoisseur, The Day After Tomorrow is simply awful. The plot doesn't really make sense, the science is nonsensical, the acting is nothing special, the dialogue is downright horrendous, and the film sort of seemed like Independence Day and Deep Impact smushed together into one giant cliche.     Well, I enjoyed both of those movies, and I enjoyed this one. There's something endearing about it despite how truly poor quality it really is. You can practically see what's going to happen before it does, yet somehow you still get excited when it does happen. I watched the ending 3 or 4 times in a row. And the special effects, which are really the only remarkable part of this movie, are spectacular. The science is bad, but they twist the explanation just well enough that you can convince yourself  that it MIGHT be possible, sort of like Jurassic Park. The acting gets the movie done. The only really awful part is the dialogue, but as long as you're not too finicky, you will probably enjoy this movie.    Two-star film, but I had a five-star viewing experience and would watch it again.

0786838655|4.0|The Lightning Thief is a non stop adventure that mixes both present day fun with a mythological twist.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a young boy who had always been getting into trouble. Every school he went to he was being thrown out of due to freak accidents happening every time. Finally as he reached 12 years old the truth was being found out, he's a demi-god. Now he has to be placed in a special summer camp for people just like him who are half humand and half greek god.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, he finds out who his father is at this camp mixed with demi-gods of all types. He befriends others who are like him. Like one girl who is the daughter of Athena named Annabeth who he befriends and another who is the son of Hermes. And even gets into trouble with the daughters of the war god Ares. It is very well written by Rick Riordan how he captures the personalities of the kids of each god and how they would act.<br /><br />Lots of mythological creatures are also added in for our enjoyment. Including a satyr named Grover who becomes Percy's best friend. Minotaurs, chimera's and cerburus. To name a few of the creatures that show up. Its a modern day mythological romp that people of all ages should enjoy.<br /><br />The main plot of the book consists of Percy having to go on a special adventure that the camp he is now in places him on due to his father claiming him to be his own. Zeus' lightning bolt had been stolen and the usual suspects are figured to be behind it. That being Hades.  Now he, Grover and Annabeth have to venture cross country to retrieve it and deal with lots of monsters, gods and problems on the way.<br /><br />The only real problem I would have is the dumbed down writing at points. The author uses some weird ways of describing things and relies too much on brand name usage. You almost feel like it was a movie showing all of the product endorcements within. Some may also feel it is a bit too young for them as they were expecting the next Harry Potter here. While it has a lot of the same elements and ideas the writing is more juvinile and watered down so just realize that going into this book that while its a good and fun adventure and story with lots of characters and situations.. its not the deep read that you may have hoped.<br /><br />Still a lot of fun though and I do highly suggest this book to those looking to start a new saga of books now that Potter is over with for good. This is a good place to start and won't disapoint. Anyone who ever wanted to live the life of Hercules or the world of Zeus will get a good time out of this series. If you ever wondered what life would be like if Greek Mythology was real today this is the place to look. It handles the adventure, characters and situations very well and will leave you wanting more. Good thing there are more books in the series to follow...of the same elements and ideas the writing is more juvinile and watered down so just realize that going into this book that while its a good and fun adventure and story with lots of characters and situations.. its not the deep read that you may have hoped.

B000MR9D5E|3.0|I returned this DVD for a couple of reasons.    1.  The balance between D.A.'s voiceover and the music was WAY off.  Granted, my DVD player isn't the greatest, but it plays movies just fine.  On this DVD, especially on the first disc, you really couldn't understand most of what Attenborough was saying.  Unless, you turned the volume up so far the music blew you out of the room.  For some reason, this was not as bad on subsequent discs.    2.  The box says \\"5 disc set\\" or some such.  The 5th DVD was a propaganda piece on \\"Global Warming\\" -- not information, just opinion.  So what you really get is a 4 disc set plus some BS.
B000R34V50|4.0|This movie certainly delivers on all aspects of the TMNT universe, from the old 'toons to the comics that inspired them. It is the one we've been waiting for.    Unfortunately, things like the narrated beginning which over-explains things which should be obvious from the storytelling, and a lack of attention to martial art related details like all the swords resting upside-down in Splinter's study (they made sure to research skateboarding moves!), and various scattered distractions, keep the movie from feeling fully 'finished.'    On the bright side, this movie is the best blu-ray experience my household has had so far. The effects have a beautiful, dark silver kind of color that is a joy to watch.    But, our biggest gripe lies with the special features.  Several deleted scenes are included (which are always the highlight for us when it comes to extras), but every single one of them is narrated by the director who talks over the actors' voices! (Just let the scenes speak for themselves.)    All in all, I'm glad the wait is over and I can now get to watching it over and over again (in blu-ray, dude!).:)  J. W. Cornelius
B000QUCNOK|4.0|\\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is one of those films that begins pretty much at the start of the end.  Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is beaten and dragged from his prison cell to hear the sentence of the court, which seems to have a viciousness usually reserved for regicides.  This beginning makes it clear that the murderer whose story this is will be caught.  Such a statement is true, but it is also inaccurate when it comes to capturing the nature of this 2006 film directed by Tom Tykwer (\\"[[ASIN:B00005JKN2 Heaven]]\\") based on the [[ASIN:0375725849 novel]] by Patrick S&uuml;skind.  Ultimately, I found myself thinking that this story is a fable.<br /><br />The history of perfume begins in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the name of a perfume maker appearing on a second millennium cuneiform tablet.  In the 18th century France became the center of the European perfume trade when aromatic plants grown in the Grasse region provided the raw materials for the flourishing industry.  However, S&uuml;skind's novel finds the motivation for perfume in the muck and mire that was the streets of Paris three centuries ago and even without the use of scratch-and-sniff stickers Tykwer's movie gives a sense that the city is one giant cesspool where perfumes are a necessary way of covering the smells.  Grenouille is literally born in the muck and manages to survive, growing up to evince two remarkable traits: Not only does he posses the most acute sense of smell on the planet but also has absolutely no scent of his own.<br /><br />Grenouille's unique talent leads to a peculiar obsession when he encounters two people.  One is a girl (Karoline Herfurth) who sells plums on those streets of Paris and the other is Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a master perfumer who has fallen out of favor and now resorts to trying to copy the successful perfumes of his competitors.  Grenouille wants to preserve the smell of the plum girl and it is in the service of that obsession that he becomes a murderer.  Baldini agrees to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.  However, once there what catches Grenouille's attention are not the plants of the region but the young women of Grasse, especially the beautiful Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), a wealthy and well-respected citizen of the town.<br /><br />John Hurt's narration is a major part of the film since Grenouille is a man of very few words who spends most of his time sniffing the air and inhaling deeply the scents that catch his attention.  The narration is also needed to ensure the audience catches the attendant ironies of the story's conclusion.  It is Hurt's tone as much as his words that confirm my idea that this story is a fable.  Except for the layers of irony at the end I might be tempted to call \\"Perfume\\" a parable, but the uniqueness of both Grenouille's character and his story are such that it cannot be extrapolated to the audience in any meaningful way.  There is no catharsis to be found here and none is intended, but \\"Perfume\\" is very much in the tradition of the tragic heroes of ancient Greece where the Fates often dictated an ironic demise.  As such, it will not be to everybody's taste, but then that is not the primary sense at play in this partiucular tale.es to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.

0316067598|5.0|There's a great deal of controversy surrounding this book, many of the active SEALs do not believe it should have been written, Lt. Murphy's father thinks it denigrates his son's memory, some of those close to those lost in the rescue efforts think it is an attempt to capitalize on their loss. I believe they are all wrong, this story needed to be told and kudos to the President for approving the publication. America does need heros and this account is full of them. Absolutely spellbinding, I read straight through it and could not lay it down. The fact that we have men like this in service to the nation should be a source of pride to us all. I highly recommend this to any reader.
6305546789|5.0|Once Halloween was Samhain, the one night of the year when the dead returned to cause trouble for the living.<br /><br />Well, Michael Myers wasn't dead, but on \\"Halloween\\" he returned to cause trouble for the people of his hometown, with all its dark houses and teenage victims. And John Carpenter's masterpiece lives up to its reputation: creepy, eerie, harrowing, and full of solid acting from Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis.<br /><br />On Halloween, 1963, young Michael Myers lurked outside the house while his sister had sex with her boyfriend. After he left, Michael put on a mask, picked up a knife, and stabbed his sister to death.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is about to take Myers to a legal hearing, when Myers (Nick Castle) breaks open the psych hospital and escapes in Loomis' car. On Halloween, teenage Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) notices a silent, masked figure popping up and disappearing near her school, house, and neighborhood.<br /><br />Despite this, she goes about her babysitting duties, even taking care of another girl's charge overnight. The only problem is, the girl is dead, and so is another pal and her boyfriend. Dr. Loomis is staking out Myers' old home, unaware that Myers is now prowling the house where Laurie is staying -- and there seems to be no way to avoid the knife-wielding \\"evil.\\"<br /><br />It sounds like a thousand knockoff movies made since then, but \\"Halloween\\" formed the original mold. And like any other groundbreaker, it is the most stripped-down, intense example of the genre -- little gore, little graphic violence, but the way it's handled is enough to make your hair stand on end, and make you go to bed with a gun under your pillow.<br /><br />And Carpenter handles the spookiness beautifully -- initially, the story is pleasantly average -- teen gossip, small-town atmosphere, and chatter about boyfriends, dances and babysitting. It has the occasional spooky moment -- such as Myers popping out of a hedge to stare at Laurie -- but isn't really scary just yet. But as Myers starts bumping off teenagers, the plot darkens and twists.<br /><br />Carpenter spins up a claustrophobic, trapped feeling, partly due to a shadowy old house full of windows and doors, any of which could be Myers' way in. You can't help but jump with every shadow. And Carpenter sprinkles the plot with unspeakably creepy moments -- Myers quietly slithering in a window above Laurie, or dressing as a ghost with only his heavy breathing to identify him.<br /><br />Curtis was the original scream queen thanks to this movie, and she does an amazing job -- even when she's racing around pounding on doors and shrieking, she seems realistic. Pleasance is just as good as Loomis, who is determined and full of dread at what his patient is, but also has his moments of humour (like when he frightens some pranksters at the Myers house). And though we only see Myers' face a few times, his masked face, silent movements and heavy breathing are the stuff of nightmare.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" was a more psychological, atmospheric kind of horror, and it did its job almost too well.

B000JU7N7E|5.0|This is truly a wonderful book.  It easily ranks in my top five.  I have read it nine times now (once a year for the last nine years), and it still makes me laugh when I read it.  I highly recommend this (and everything Pratchett writes, really).
B0000025D0|5.0|One of the very greatest albums ever released, Darkness On The Edge Of Town is where anyone interested in Springsteen should start. It's not about the romanticism of Born To Run or The Wild,The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle; it's about , well, when you feel that you truly relate to and understand what \\"a head-on collision smashing in my guts\\" means; Badlands is a clarion call to stand tall in the face the most incredible adversity, and likewise the title track (\\"I'll be there on time, and I'll pay the cost\\", he shouts as if there is any doubt) and The Promised Land, which reminds one to literally blow away all things that are breaking your heart and mind into pieces; you can overcome! Anyone who prefers Born To Run, to me is either not in a quandry, or more likely prefers romantic dreams over songs about facing up to harsh realities and kicking them in the ass. Or trying, at the very least! For this is what this album is about. On Streets of Fire, Springsteen documents the lives of the ignored, the abandoned and forsaked (\\"I walk with angels that have no place\\"). I've related to that line in a personal way all my life. That line is not far from another one of my favorite albums of all time, The Wipers \\"Over The Edge\\", or the song \\"Yellow Walls\\" by Jackson C. Frank (again, from another personal all-time fave); Streets Of Fire is a masterpiece in and of itself, true torment of a soul on the losing edge; but there is no giving up; there is a sickness of being abused, in lines like \\"when the night's quiet and you don't care anymore\\"; this person simply can't and won't take it anymore. Something in The Night chronicles  again someone who's just had so much that they have to put the radio on to avoid thinking; it ends with Springsteen's finest vocal performance ever, a howl that sounds as wounded as anything ever commited to vinyl. And for those who feel this album doesn't contain the passion of Born To Run (ha!), there's Candy's Room, which is as passionate and desperate as anything resembling a love song has ever been. But passion is behind this whole album, although there are moments where weariness can be the main factor (the drudgery of working in a factory; the girl resigned to crying all alone at night in Racing in the Street); in a way, this is Bruce Springsteen Sings For Only The Lonely.  The guitars are blazing (particuarly in Adam Raised A Cain), and the Darkness tour is one of THE landmark tours in rock n roll history; in fact, all but Something In The Night sound better live on the 5 radio broadcasts he gave that year; unfortunately, Colonel Jon Landau never saw his way fit to release a live album from the tour! The Agora show was mixed for release , then abandoned; the Winterland show is the one to start with, if they ever decide to issue a live show from this tour before all his old-time fans are dead. And Springsteen, while issuing great stuff since, at times ( The River, great rockers at times-- The Ties That Bind, Jackson Cage, etc.-- is overall a bit of an incoherent mess, but Independence Day-- recorded for this!-- is a masterpiece; and Atlantic City from Nebraska is surely one of his finest, as is Walk Like a Man from Tunnel Of Love; Land Of Hope And Dreams,etc). Forget about what he's doing now; it ain't that great (except for When The Saints Go Marching In); forget the sell-out of Born In The U.S.A. which turned off MANY from the greatness that is (was?) Bruce Springsteen, THIS is the real deal, and he's never come close to equaling this album, despite many great songs sprawled across many good-to-great albums. This is the album that will always be the true cornerstone of his career. An absolute, total masterpiece, unrelenting in its refusal to give in to the dying of the light. A MUST for any rock n roll fan.

078322737X|5.0|I grew up in Northern California and graduated from Fremont High School in the not so small town of Oakland in 1965 (and later from California Polytechnic University in San luis Obispo in 1975, after a short stint in the service). I remember the Mel's drive-in in downtown Oakland, and I remember the 'cruising' on San Leandro Blvd on Friday and Saturday nights (although I couldn't afford to get a car until 1968--a 1961 Volvo PV 544 sedan--(Wow, I wish I had that car back!). I have to say that this movie is truly one of the best nostalgia stirring movies I have ever seen. It tugs at your heart and reminds us babyboomers that there really was a simpler, more carefree time and we lived it! When gas was 23 cents a gallon (or less when the gas wars were on), you loved Casper's Hotdogs, and education costs were almost nothing if you attended Merritt Junior College. When you rode on the back of your friend's Vespa motorbike to San Jose, just because you had never been there, and when you took off in your car on a whim to visit Big Basin to see the redwoods. Talk about a movie that causes you to reminisce!
B000000W94|4.0|I'll keep this brief: this is a superb \\"tribute\\" album. Moore clearly idolizes Green and the way he reinterprets these pieces could have resulted in too much \\"we are not worthy\\" posturing. Instead, Moore keeps things direct and honest, his playing both lyrical and biting (much like Green's playing within The Bluesbreakers!). This album made me smirk stupidly while driving home after a hard day's work (and on the eve of a week-long vacation!). Superb production, excellent performances, ace songs. And such is the same of ALL of Moore's blues releases (even his 2007 release!). You say you love icy guitar licks? Got all the SRV releases and are longing for mo(o)re? Gary's your man!
B000066JLO|5.0|Analogue Productions' SACD surpasses all previous digital versions of this classic recording. Only Analogue's LP offers a comparable listening experience. By comparision, the 20bit K2 limited edition CD release suffers from tape hiss and peak distortion on the piano track, suggesting that it was transferred from a second-generation copy.     Play this SACD on a quiet Sunday afternoon, and picture yourself in the Village Vanguard in 1961 listening to three young men create one of the most singularly beautiful sets of modern jazz.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Visit [...]    Visit [...]    There's a lot of hype surrounding 'Children of Men,' a depressing and hopeless vision of a futuristic world where women are infertile. I finally had my turn at screening the film in the comforts of my living room. Even before the first scene fades into view, we hear voices from news anchors talking about the political climate of the times. When we do get a glimpse of this world, we see a mass of people crowded in a coffee shop, mourning the loss of the world's youngest person - an eighteen year-old, known as \\"Baby Diego.\\" For 18 years no child has been born, and the year 2027 is a depressing, hopeless place, filled with political upheaval and government oppression.    It's in this turbulent time that a one-time radical activist-turned-cynic named Theo (Clive Owen) is given a proposition by his former love-interest Julian (Julianne Moore). She asks him to abandon his rut-filled cubicle existence and assist her radical rights group (known as The Fishes) smuggle a young pregnant girl out of the country to rendevous with a mythical group called The Human Project. From the moment he agrees, Theo's life changes in ways he could not expect.    Children of Men is a dark and ultra-realistic take on the ver-near future. There are no flying cars here. No outrageous, colorful outfits. No droids to do the human's bidding. It's a place where chaos and inhumanity reigns. It's the manifestiation of our generation's fear of what \\"may be.\\" And upon this backdrop we are introduced to the most unlikely of heroes - Theo. His is an interesting character study. When we first meet him, we see that he sort of sleep-walks through life - cynical and bitter. But his association with Kee, the young pregnant girl, and his experiences thereafter, rekindle his hope for humanity.    Technically speaking, Children of Men achieves some very wonderful shots. The director chose to shoot scenes in ultra-long takes, which gives the film a sense of real-time and viewer participation. There are very few cuts throughout the film, but one hardly notices, as the acting and story succeed in holding our attention. Particularly impressive is a scene lasting approximately four minutes wherein five actors sit inside a car, having a conversation. There are no cuts throughout the entire scene and the camera moves fluidly throughout the space, even rotating 360 degrees to show the viewer what lies ahead on the road. Truly remarkable.    The film is very dark and depressing, and probably won't leave a lot of viewers with a good taste in their mouths, but the more one reflects on the story and its characters, the more one appreciates what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. I especially enjoyed the cinematography and shot selection. The characters are very well developed and the viewer can easily sympathize with their plight. The dialogue is good throughout the film - well structured without unrealistic expository statements. The viewer is left to figure out many things on his own and that is what helps create a compelling film.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I believe alot of people are forgetting the whole point of why Jesus sufferred the way He did. They forget the Father, the Eternal Father. He sent His Eternal Son and Jesus' suffering and passion was the way God the Father chose to help bring people back to himself. For God the Father to send Grace to the world and to bless the world the Father sees His Son on the cross and in this way He blesses the world.What pleased the Father was the willingness of His Son to undergo the Passion. To see His Son on the cross is not what pleased the Father, no, it was His Son's willingness to suffer. Jesus could have easily prevented anyone taking His Life. He is God. Yet His willingness to undergo suffering was motivated by His Love for us and to reveal to us the real enemy of our souls that is the devil. God needed to wrestle us from the clutches of the devil. His death actually defeated the devil and revealed the devil as he truly is and inagurated the Kingdom He wants to establish based on Love and Mercy. How could God do it in any other way. Most of the world had rejected Him and continues to reject Him today yet His Son and the Remembrance of the Passion of His Son, the Eternal Father sends His Grace especially for the forgiveness of sins so that we may be able to receive The Holy Spirit. Can you see what sin did to man. Sin did not change God. It changed man. The cost to heal man was the sending of His Son. And for those who reflect on this cost and realize their own condition He is then able to heal them. It was God's Love for us that motivated Him to send His Son.

The squirrel has not yet found the acorn that will grow into the oak that will be cut to form the cradle of the babe who will grow to slay me.\\"<br /><br />Tristran Thorn is a young man living in the remote English town of Wall. Just as the name of the town implies a wall surrounds it from the land of Faerie. Guards protect the opening to and from Faerie to prevent denizens from Wall from stumbling out into the bizarre and dangerous world beyond. One night, in a declaration of love, Tristran promises the town beauty, Victoria, that he will retrieve a fallen star for her. Victoria, believing him mad and craven, promises him whatever his heart desires. Tristran sets out towards the star with his heart full of her.<br /><br />Things become complicated when Tristran arrives at the star site to discover that the fallen star is a young and beautiful woman who has broken her leg. Things become worse when Tristran decides to fulfill his promise to Victoria by binding the star with a magic chain and forcing her to accompany him back to Wall. In fact the star becomes downright contemptible to him, calling him all manner of epithets and proving to be most disagreeable. Having little option though she sets out with him for the long journey to his home.<br /><br />A series of misadventures follows, some dire some hilarious. Added to the chaotic situation is the fact that a witch queen of the Lilim has decided to pursue Tristran and the star, intending to take the stars heart for her and her sisters as a means of warding off their impressively old age, for everyone in Faerie who uses magic pays the price in time, and the witches are all ancient. Plus, there are three remaining heirs to the land of Stormhold who turn up here and there in the story, each one vying to become the next king of Stormhold, and trying to kill each other in the process.<br /><br />\\"Have been unavoidably detained by the world.

B00000IQW3|5.0|This space fantasy offers action, adventure, humor, great characters, and many memorable scenes. Robert Preston's character Centauri is a wonderful parody of his famous portrayal of Professor Harold Hill in \\"The Music Man.\\" Dan O'Herlihy plays the wise and lovable alien pilot Grig and manages to convey an amazing amount of facial expression through his full-head prosthetic makeup. Catherine Mary Stewart is incredibly appealing as Maggie, the girlfriend next door. Lance Guest does a great job as our hero, the talented, ambitious, but frustrated Alex Rogan who finds himself whisked to another part of the galaxy to join a battle against an evil force that he had thought only existed in a video game. But as Alex learns, Earth's in danger too.<br />Using computer-generated imagery for all the space scenes was a pioneering move in the mid-1980s when most studios were still using models. Yes, we've come a long way in digital animation since then, but the quality is good enough so that it still holds up well, never detracting from the storytelling. Besides, they never could have used Death Blossom in the battle scene if they had stayed with physical models. (You'll understand when you see it.)<br />Underneath it all is a dynamic musical score that can stand proudly next to the other space classics. The only thing this movie lacks is a sequel. It leaves you wondering what Alex's next adventure will be.
0385335989|4.0|Diana Gabaldon takes us back in time into the lives of Jamie and Claire. The author as usual does her research on the topics and settings and when the story unfolds you can feel the detail descriptions she portrays to the scenes, the attire, and characters.  I thought Drums of Autumn was a wonderful book and I look forward (I'm a little late to this author) to her next book in the series. I highly recommend this romantic and adventurous story.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|This rich documentary, Pet Shop Boys: Life in Pop (2006), begins with Chris Lowe playing a Wurlitzer organ at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom. From this auspicious and somewhat whimsical beginning, we hear about the duo that would eventually become the Pet Shop Boys. Alternating between Chris Lowe's suburban English childhood in Blackpool to Neil Tennant's early adventures in Newcastle, Tennant dreamt of rushing off to London all the while reading and gallivanting with friends at the local Literary and Philosophical Society. Running 140 minutes, this documentary, directed by George Scott, never meanders into pointless discussion.   Scott arranges carefully, the lengthy and ongoing career of these two highly talented pop musicians who would make history with their seminal hit, West End Girls. We are treated to anecdotes concerning their academic aspirations which influenced both of them, their careful and specific focus on their image, and the history behind their wide-ranging songs. Most of all, we get a sense of their enormous creative talent which distinguished them from other musicians because they never ceased \\"re-inventing\\" themselves in new ways. As a result, some of their work would be dismissed by critics only to be lauded in hindsight.   In addition to Tennant and Lowe, various interviews include: Brandon Flowers (The Killers), Los Angeles disc-jockey, Richard Blade, Robbie Williams (Take That), and other musicians and critics. There is footage of PSB working closely with Liza Minnelli and some thoughtful reflections from photographer, Bruce Weber, who would eventually direct two of PSB's videos, (e.g. Being Boring). The DVD includes a generous heaping of extras including a complete music clip of \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This\\" in concert with the unflappable Dusty Springfield performing with Tennant and Lowe. Life in Pop, given its nearly comprehensive treatment of its subject matter, may be of greater viewing advantage to seasoned Pet Shop Boys fans.

0385495323|4.0|Singh has provided the reader a delightful history of encryption, beginning with 16th-century codes, proceeding with the mechanized ones, and concluding with modern computer-based systems. He points out how modern encryption is being used to thwart the counterfeiting of dollars, and rejects the so-called Bible Code.<br /><br />Singh also touches on the intricacies of language, and discusses the difficulty of deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics. This involved the decoding of a language that no one speaks today, and one which has no close relatives among modern languages. He also has a fascinating account of the Navajo Indians and their unique language, and how their conversations were used to keep the Japanese in the dark during WWII.<br /><br />When in comes to the German ENIGMA code of WWII, and in contrast to some English-language books on this subject, Singh gives credit squarely where it is due. He traces the Polish successes with code-breaking, beginning with the cracking of Russian codes by the Biuro Szyfrow (the Bureau of Ciphers) during the 1920 Polish-Bolshevik War (p. 144). In the years before WWII, a Polish team of mathematicians headed by Marian Rejewski recognizably solved the ENIGMA (p. 155). The Poles were ten years ahead of anyone else in this field (p. 160). The later successes of the British at Bletchley relied on Rejewski's work (p. 170), and followed the lead of the Poles (p. 243). Alan Turing followed Rejewski's strategy (p. 171).
B00004WEJZ|3.0|While this remake of Thunderball is better in story development and action than the original, it lacks the technical genius of the Broccoli films.  Kim Basinger can't act, can't dance, and is having a bad hair day throughout the movie.  On the other hand Barbara Carrera is one of the great Bond villians.  More importantly, like they said way back in the sixties -- Sean Connery IS James Bond and that's never changed.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my favorite favorite FAVORITE movie!! It is an amazing adaptation to the original novel. I think it's hard to appreciate the movie if you haven't read the book though. Considering how they had to squeeze a 60+ chapter story into about 2 hours, it's really an amazing movie. The story and plot of the original movie is quite deep and rich so if you haven't read the book it might be a bit hard to understand the movie especially the first time through. Anyone who wants to truly appreciate this movie should definitely consider reading the book if you haven't already.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|good movie, interesting with a good twist. Paul Giamatti does an excellent job! i recommend this one.
B00005JPLW|4.0|This movie has the classic solid storyline of priciple over everything, but if it were not for the action and the cinematography, I would have fallen asleep.  Once I shut my brain off, this was a great movie to watch.  Full of cheesy lines to pump soldiers up and get testosterone flowing, action and fighting scenes paralleled to none this past year.  I actually took a nap during the first 20 minutes, but once the 300 marched, I was watching intently.  This movie is very gory, and should not under any circumstances be viewed by young kids, but for adults, and the target audience of men ages 18-30, this will likely meet the quota of action you may need for a week or two.  Check this out, worth renting, caution on buying.  This is no gladiator, but worth a look.

Gonna have to read it.    I liken Morgan's work to William Gibson's, which I adore, although I don't think anyone has anything on Gibson's ability to imagine the NEAR future.    Morgan's characters and drama are frickin' gorgeous, although we all know they'll screw it up in a movie (remember Johnny Mnemonic?).    Read it while it's still unspoiled.

0684865130|2.0|Just finished reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22.    I did not like it. Here are my reasons. I have avoided citation of specific instances in support of a point so as not to give anything away.    Heller works the novel like an Archilochus/Isaiah Berlin hedgehog - around the idea of people entrapped, enervated and then destroyed by intended and unintended contradictions of, in this case, the war machinery. Perhaps the indictment is of any powerful bureaucracy - even life itself. The irrational and dehumanizing aspects of war unfold in farcical iterations. Each iteration further fleshes out and reinforces the chimerical webs that entrap the flies - the harder they struggle against it.    The author is most formidable in his use of the language. What skill it must take to overuse the language so incredibly, yet, so lightly. His pen shows no strain - none at all - as it moves left to right, up and down - over and over again - fluting out in steady drips a full mountain of descriptors. It would be achievement enough if the overlapping descriptors somehow came together harmlessly. But here the imagery is all the more better for it. As if, using the elements/techniques of oil painting, one has churned out a most exquisite set of watercolors! Gestures, expressions, movement of any kind rise from the medium of words to that of a resplendent image almost immediately. This, I propose, is Heller's true achievement.    No doubt, Heller has several sources and inspirations. Certainly one of them is Dostoevsky, class Hedgehog. But Heller's one big idea is hardly novel. Literature has many memorably executed suffocating, paradoxical, tragicomic bureaucracies. Repetition of an idea is in itself not a critical drawback because new ideas are not so easy to come by. An existing idea newly represented such as to expand its scope and understanding can be just as worthy an achievement. But there too Heller falls short.    Heller fails because his deliberate, repeating exaggerations becometoo repetitious. The iterative unfolding of the novel is thick with dialogs, events, characterizations that repeat far more than they move. After a point these repetitions do not add anything significant to any aspect of the novel. The plot is not any more intricate for it. The characters are not any more intelligent or coherent or paranoid for it. The repetitions cease to reinforce anything. In-fact they blunt any worthwhile movement that comes along. Such as ascension of Milo's enterprise into lunacy. The repetitions strip all the edge of such progressions.    Since Heller himself makes several references to Crime and Punishment let us consider it. Too serious and intricate a comparison would be silly but one may still compare certain general aesthetics like plot and character richness. Look at the exquisite contemplative gallop with which Raskalnikov moves to crime and then towards punishment. Look at the coherence of his paranoia. Look at the rich characterizations of Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovitch.    But yes, having said that, I think, Yossarian's stroll through war torn Rome is just as beautifully illustrated as any of Raskalnikov's stroll through Petersburg.    All in all, I think the novel is worth reading for its language. Otherwise, I would put it after so many of those other outstanding classics.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is the best television writing I have ever seen.<br />The characters, the way their pasts intertwine, the way their existence on the island is tied to the island, the way that the island is a part of the story, all of it is great and it drives me crazy because I do not like TV. I never watch popular TV because it is boring, old and cliche, but LOST has broken the mould and sucked me in.<br />The entire team involved in LOST is a cut above the rest. I got in to this show when my wife was watching it and I had to go back to the beginning in order to see the entire series. NOW, I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIGGIN' FEBRUARY, 2008 FOR THE SHOW TO GO ON; MADDENING!!!!!<br />There were only a couple of episodes that were not spectacular, and even those were not terrible. I am not following all of the conspiracy types that are obsessing over where the show is going, so I don't know what to expect next, but I cannot wait for season 4.<br />So far every single season has gotten better than the previous and I have no doubt that season 4 will be better than season 3.<br />This has to be one of the best shows ever made.
B00005MP58|4.0|I liked this version because it does give more details of what Darcy was probably feeling. But my most favorite is the newest version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I think its great the way Matthew can show the facial expressions that go with the storyline. You almost think he is a different person. If your a P&P fan you will want to see all the movies. I suggest owning them. You can usually see something you missed the first time.
B0000071J0|5.0|Along with Banco, Le Orme are considered the cream of the crop of 70's era progressive rock from Italy.  I do not speak Italian so I have no clue what this album is about, but the music is all very good and the vocals well done.  I guess I would describe the mood of this album to be somber.  The music flows together in classic Italian progressive rock style.  I believe it is a concept piece.  The album is short by modern standards clocking in at only 33 minutes, but everything here is enjoyable.  If you are looking for classic Italian progressive rock it does not get much better than this.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and think this is her best so far. My favorite songs on this album is \\"Never Again,\\" \\"Sober,\\" \\"Be Still.\\" Don't get me wrong I love all of the songs but these are my favorites though. If you want to hear great music, get her CD and you won't regret.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|This production is a work of art, a rainbow of cultures that crisscross languages including Morrocan, Japanese, English, Spanish, and Sign Language with one basic human trait, the need to love and be loved, which is the message of this film. There are no English captions and none are needed.  This is a movie that any human being alive can understand perfectly without understanding the language; making this picture a connecting and unique film such has never been done before.  There is nothing like this.  Get it.  See it.  Buy it for your DVD collection.<br /><br />Anyone who feels lonely or who is filled with jealousy, prejudice and hate, must see this movie.  This film is a real mind opener about life on this planet and the things we often take for granted.<br /><br />This is an adult R rated movie with violence, nudity and drug use.
0671027344|5.0|Its one of those rare finds that you can't put down and will love instantly. The main character's endless forgiveness and questioning through anonymous letters is chillingly revealing and perfectly secret. Its a book like no other and is something you will be dying to spread. It deals with all kinds of issues without preaching abstinence to them. Its simply a story of a boy, living his high school years to the fullest: experimenting, loving, and discovering. Its a cult classic in the make.
0393324818|3.0|In 2002, the season that this book concerns itself with, the Oakland Athletics tied for the league lead with 103 victories.  The book Moneyball frankly admits that it doesn't wish to concern itself with pitching, but rather with hitting--runs and on base percentage (OBP).  The reader is told time again that runs and OBP define the game, that pitching is secondary and fielding a distance third.  This strikes me as fundamentally ridiculous: the way baseball teams win games is not by scoring runs, but by scoring more than the opposition.  And that means pitching is essential.<br /><br />Let's look at the 2002 Athletics.  Despite all the talk about runs, the A's were eighth in the league.  In a league with only 14 teams, that puts them in the bottom half.  Only one player (Miguel Tejada) had 100+ runs.  And what about On-base percentage?  The A's were a bit better, but only 5th in the league.  Not one of their players, including MVP Tejada, was in the top 10 in the league in OBP.  By their own metrics, this hardly seems to indicate they tied for the league lead in wins.  By using common sense, however, we can deduce that the A's pitching was probably very good.  And indeed it was.  The Athletics had three pitchers (Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, and Mark Mulder, from lowest to highest) with Earned Run Averages (ERAs) under 3.50 and two with ERAs under 3, respectively placing 3rd, 6th, and 10th in the league.  The A's pitching staff led the American league in ERA, shutouts, and fewest homeruns allowed.  After the season was over Barry Zito was awarded the Cy Young award for the best pitcher in the league.<br /><br />The point of this is not to (neccessarily) criticize sabermetrics or Billy Beane's strategy.  This is a book review, and Michael Lewis could have written a better book.  He devotes much page space to lengthy biographies of A's players and Billy Beane himself, whom the author seems to revere wholeheartedly, while not answering fundamental questions such as the title for this review: \\"What about pitching?\\" I have nothing but respect for the way Billy Beane's Athletics always seem to be in the thick of the hunt despite a low payroll, but that does not make this book any less flawed: \\"What about pitching?\\" I have nothing but respect for the way Billy Beane's Athletics always seem to be in the thick of the hunt despite a low payroll, but that does not make this book any less flawed
0618680004|5.0|Religion example: The recent bridge collapse in Minnesota was caused by Allah to punish the infidels. Also, Angels saved the children on the bus.    Secular example: The recent bridge collapse in Minnesota was caused by a weakening substructure and political inertia. The bus stopped in time.    If you believe any part of the \\"religion example,\\" you'll hate the book.  If the secular example is more satifying for you,  you'll love the book.    Regardless, it is an extremely interesting and well written book.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I've always loved this trilogy better than the newer ones.  I remember watching these when I was five and just loving every minute of them.  Now that I'm older and understand things a bit better, I enjoy them even more.  The only thing I don't like is having the new Anakin show up in the last part of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".

0312360266|5.0|Zoe Redbird is not having one of her better days. She's trying to break up with her boyfriend, her best friend is driving her crazy, and now she's been Marked by a vampyre. Zoe enters The House of Night where, as she undergoes her change, she will train to become an adult vampyre. To top things off, Zoe discovers she is no average fledgling. She has been Marked by the vampyre goddess Nix. This is the first book in The House of Night series and wow, what a great beginning! This is aimed at teenagers but adult fans of all things that go bump in the night will also love it, especially if you're already a fan of P.C. Cast's adult novels. Zoe is a wonderful character who you root for through the entire book. The secondary characters are also fantastic, even the villains. Best of all, unlike some books which are co-authored, the chapters flow seemlessly from mother and daughter. There's also quite a bit of humor and I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading. One word of caution: there's one somewhat graphic sexual scene near the beginning of the book. It's all in keeping with the storyline, and what todays teenagers face, but I don't know if I'd feel comfortable recommending it to middle schoolers. The second book \\"Betrayed will be coming out in October.
0440238609|1.0|I wish I could give this zero stars.  My daughter gave me this book to read.  I started reading it and was instantly sucked in.  It's very well written and the character is very likeable.  Then I started reading reviews and interviews with the author, who says \\"My book is about killing God\\".  The enemy in these books is God, the premise that in the war for Heaven the wrong side won....that God is a power hungry senile jerk....<br /><br />I will not finish this series.  I think I'll go re-read the Narnia books now.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|This was the first paramore album that I've purchased and I was blown away.  There's not a bad song on the album and most of the songs are very catchy.  Hayley's voice is amazing (on the album and live).  The lyrics capture teenager/relationship angst perfectly.  I recommend this album to anyone.  I have actually turned some of my friends into fans of Paramore, and they usually don't listen to indie/punk/emo stuff.  That's just shows Paramore's ability to cross genres in its music!
B000R5N1MC|5.0|How many films mark an era in film making like Blade Runner? I've been fascinated by this movie since it came out back in '82. I was only 11, but I remember reading the Marvel comic, the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and eventually in college adding the vcr tape to my collection in it's various released editions. Finally the ultimate collection looks to be available very shortly and I find myself just as excited as when I first heard 'the guy who played Han Solo is in a new movie..!' 25 years ago.<br /><br />I've seen outtake stills and skimmed through the 'making of' books with much curiosity. Learning behind the scene facts about how miserable it was on the set at times and how Harrison Ford had a reputation for not 'liking' the film. This stuff always fascinated me. To think, that the creation of such a creative project could harbor with in it's working process so many negativities and still come out in my mind as perfect was very interesting to me. Time and again, I'd view this movie and see wires lifting up ships and dialog miss cues (that are apparently to be corrected in this latest version)and think that they were done for effect, not by mistake. I guess that's how much I wanted to love this film and still do.<br /><br />You can bet I'll be all over this brief case edition. To watch the new version and cherish the old, mistakes and all.

I don't remember crying so much throughout the reading of a book.  There are so many emotions to deal with, pride, sadness, anger, etc., oh and did I mention pride?  I felt like I knew each and every one of the team members.  I thought at first, with the explanation of the training, this would be a lengthy, boring read.  But once I got into the story itself I understood why it was necessary to explain the extent of the training.  How special and tough these guys have to be in order to survive.  I don't normally give five stars to anything but this book is worth every single star.  It is a must read indeed!
B000002MIF|5.0|I'm sure others would argue for a particular album, or perhaps Louder Than Bombs, but if you have no Smiths in your collection and you only want one album, this is it.  I have the LP, it cost me $12 in the 80's (which was a lot to me at the time), and I recently bought the CD to play in my car.  If there is a dissapointment on this album, it is the studio recording of What Difference Does it Make? which bugged me when I first bought the album (one of my favorite songs by them at the time...again, in the 80's) - but as I've gotten older, it is actually refreshing.    This Charming Man has easily one of the best guitar/bass melodies to come out of the 80's, How Soon is Now? is impeccable and utterly listenable...the band shows great range, with its melancholic and yet punkish approach to music.  Hatful of Hollow is their best.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The photography and narration are among the best I have seen for this type of film, and I watch a lot of them. My only complaint, and its a small one, is in the extras portion. Where they show you the inner work required to get particularly hard shot (shown at the end of each episode). Some of the stuff they say seems a bit sensationalist \\"Hollywood\\". The team's commitment to get tough shots certainly comes through, but really, can we be honest about how difficult the shots actually were to get?     I'm not saying I don't enjoy a little follow up story and learning more about how you managed to get such amazing shots. However, are we really supposed to believe you are the first ever to capture a live perona feeding frenzy on tape? So your team had a tough time finding perona's to tape. People in that region find them quite regularly. So I find the claim that you had a crazy struggle strange and a distant possibly. Not to mention that I have seen no less that 3 other live perona attacks on film. Most of which seemed more authentic, one of which captured the last few minutes a some slow large animal who picked the wrong spot to cool off at. However, you appear to have thrown a dead fish in for them to eat, but I could be wrong.     Regardless, I enjoyed these DVD's so much that I more than willing to mark that up to a little sensationalism. Its just that Planet Earth can stand on its own without bogus jibber jabber.
0596527055|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It gives a lot of insight into how some of the worlds best minds came up with their ideas for innovative products. The tone is light yet informative. This book definitely gave me something to think about in terms of how ideas come about and different ways to think about problems.
6305657947|5.0|This is a very good remake. Pierce Brosnan is more dashing than cool but Rene Russo is just plain hot! My wife says they used body doubles for the wild sex scenes - Horay for stunt men! The guy playing Catherine Banning must have shaved his legs.    The biggest difference between the original and the remake is the psychological make-up of the principal characters. Neither Brosnan nor Russo play antisocial characters as did McQueen and Dunaway. In the remake, Crown is just a rich guy who is bored and likes art. Russo's character displays the ethics and good judgement you would attribute to a successful insurance investigator in real life. Brosnan and Russo portrayed the believable characters of a love story. Thomas Crown II has a feel good ending and reinforces most of what we are looking for in our own lives; with just a little bit more flair!    BUY THE MOVIE - watch it with you sweetie and eat a warm snack, like popcorn. You're gonna have a good time!
B000H305U0|5.0|Ok, I usually don't review recent albums, but this album is one I HAD to review because I enjoyed it THAT much. I think the last album I enjoyed like this was Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable (almost two years ago). So, that tells you how many recent albums are worth my precious penny. So yea, I was thoroughly impressed with JT's latest record. I actually liked the last album too, but it wasn't as complete as this one. It was uneven at times. This album is fluent and catchy, mainly because Timberland handles most of the production, instead of a myriad of producers. Not to say that Timberlake isn't a great musician. He is, but we all know the beats rule on MOST good albums. So, I give credit where credit is due. And the credit is paying dividends, with FutureSex selling 4 million copies and SIX radio hits (\\"Summer Love\\", \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"What Goes Around\\", \\"Love Stoned\\", \\"Until the End of Time\\").     Now that HALF the album is worth listening to, let's focus on the album tracks. My first recommendation would be the title track. It's a great opener with its heavy bass and dark vocals. JT really shows his mystical side, leading right into the Grammy-nominated \\"SexyBack\\". Skipping to \\"Chop Me Up\\", JT, Three 6 Mafia and Timberland exchange colorful rhymes. Not the best bars, but with Timberland's distinct style and Three 6's country tongue, this one WILL not go unnoticed. The last great track is a slow one in \\"Losing My Way\\". As in Justified, JT shows his softer side for the ladies. He isn't as convincing as Usher, but he is the closest competition to him. Timberland laces a cozy melody, fit just for JT's mellow voice and sing-a-long chorus. An enjoyable listen.     So, how many tracks do you HAVE to play everytime you hear the record? 9! (6 radio hits, 3 album bangers). That only leaves 3 that you MAY skip when you first hear them (I doubt it though). If you haven't heard the album, you must hear it and then get it. It's definitely worth the accolades deserved and price retailed. I thought it would have sold more by now, but the music industry is in a recession so triple-platinum is pretty good. Maybe when the industry rights the ship, it'll do 6-7 million. Highly recommended.     Grade: A
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Steve McQueen was definitely the \\"King-of-Cool!\\" Faye Dunaway was a very sophisticated and beautiful actress who complimented McQueen in the casting of this movie. This movie is actually about two antisocial personality types (clinically speaking); a man who planned armed robberies and a woman who planned the kidnapping of a child, auto-theft, and burglary.     Sometimes, similar personalities don't compliment each other. Faye fails the test and looses Mr. Crown forever! The King-of-cool flies off into the sunset with the knowledge that he is financially independent and a very good judge of human behavior. The only question left for Thomas Crown is can money buy happiness?    Buy both the original and the remake - then compare and contrast the differences in the characters psychological make-up. These are two distinctly different movies.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The presentation is easy to follow and the consequences are drastic. A realy good example how to transport a message.

0743496728|1.0|I have read quite of few of Picoult's books, but this will be my last.  Her style has become too predictable - a tragedy occurs, we flash back to find out how it happened, and a shocking twist at the end.  These characters were not believable.  Could the boy's mother really have been that clueless?  Is the girl's mother so in need of approval that she condones the sexual practices between her daughter and her jock boyfriend in their own living room?  Could every teacher been that unobservant and uncaring?  Is every popular kid a monster and bully?    This topic is too serious to be treated in this fictional account.  Shame on Picoult for manipulating her readers.  She should know better, and the readers deserve better!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Plain, simple, good! I love dedicated messengers who are able to transmit a story. It is a message everybody should get!    However, it was a pain for me to realize, that this DVD was region coded. Is this really a messengers mission? I thought, it is a global problem and not a problem, that could be region coded. However, I am looking forward to the great US nation and their media industry and simply trust, they will lock away the problem with a region code...
B00004XMTJ|2.0|I loved the \\"Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat\\" DVD and always liked the \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" soundtrack from way back in the 70s when I would sneak into my sister's room to listen to her records.  So I thought that \\"Cats\\" would be a great addition to my DVD collection and bought it to share with my three year old daughter.  I found it boring.  The music wasn't that great. The story was uninspired in my view.  To its' credit the costumes were pretty cool.  I had to laugh this week when I saw Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's \\"Colbert Report\\" say he had \\"suffered through\\" \\"Cats\\" because I felt the same way. So I'm not the only person disappointed.  My daughter liked it, though.  She probably won't want to watch it again, though, so I'll most likely put it up on e-bay.
B00005JNJV|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is the best film yet about Bob Kane's Caped Crusader. It goes a little over the top at the end, and someone should tell star Christian Bale that his imitation, intentional or not, of Clint Eastwood's voice sounds more like Kurt Russell in those \\"Escape from New York\\" movies than the man himself, but the movie is ambitious in ways that 1989's Batman was not, especially in detailing the origins of Bruce Wayne's altar ego.<br /><br /> And the cast...whoa, the cast: Gary Oldman as Gordon before he became Commissioner, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as the inventor who supplies Batman with his hi-tech gadgets, and Liam Neeson as an early mentor. This is the fifth \\"Batman\\" movie from Warner Bros., but it's not a sequel. It's a fresh start.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

B000GPIPT2|5.0|James Whale's film, based on Mary Shelley's classic novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" was produced at Universal in 1931 as a follow-up to the immensely successful \\"Dracula.\\" Even more than the Bela Lugosi shocker, Frankenstein created a sensation in its day, terrifying audiences in ways that no film had done before. Now, of course, \\"Frankenstein\\" is so tame it could even be recommended viewing for children, a group that would have been warned to avoid the film in its original release, although the scene (once deleted, but now restored) in which the Monster throws a little girl into a pond, may give them a nightmare or two.<br /><br /> \\"Frankenstein\\" is no longer frightening, but it remains impressive, and its story of a scientist who dared to imitate God is as timely as ever. Even now, in this age of computer generated special effects, Jack Pierce's stunning makeup has never been equaled or duplicated. When Boris Karloff makes his first entrance as the Monster, he still inspires awe rather than snickers.  Kenneth Strickfaden's striking laboratory sets are still a sight to behold, and were used again in Mel Brooks' send-up, \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" 43 years later.<br /><br /> But it is the performances that really transcend time. Colin Clive as the nerve frayed doctor is outstanding, as is Dwight Frye as his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (often mistakenly referred to as Ygor, the role played by Lugosi in the second sequel, 1939's \\"Son of Frankenstein\\"). Best of all is Karloff in his star-making portrayal of the Monster. It would have been easy to play the role as a lumbering idiot, but Karloff's humanity comes through to make this soulless creature an object of sympathy instead of horror.<br /><br /> One of the most important and influential films in cinema history, \\"Frankenstein\\" is essential viewing.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
1557424292|5.0|An excellent story of Dorian Gray, a young man who in a fit of vanity, prays that his newly painted portrait takes the burden of his ageing. For some mysterious reason, his wish is granted but he discovers this after his fiance is found dead when he spurned her. Her death affected his soul and the picture reflects his descent into evil (?). The picture troubles his conscience as he lives his life in search of pleasure. His beauty attracts people but his depraved lifestyle makes them shun him and eventually most people avoid him.<br />He does it all, even commits murder and the picture reflects this. He tries one good act but the picture reflects what this act is, one of vanity and hypocracy.<br />Terrific story
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a very profoundly moving and heartfelt account of the planet upon which it was made. Totally unobtrusive narration, the moving pictures themselves hardly need it but the observations by Attenbrough and the epic soundtrack may even enhance the experience further if that is possible...from the spellbinding snow leapard to the impending doom of the seals via the sharks the cinematography is very often overwhelming and extroardinary...Anyway i'm running out of superlatives so why don't you buy this and see it's beauty for yourselves.    Highly recommended.
B0001WGDXA|4.0|This boxed set of Bernstein conducting Brahms allows collectors to buy his Viennese recordings of the symphonies at a budget price. Lenny coaxes peerless sounds from the orchestra and draws from them impassioned performances of these masterworks. I know some of you might quibble about mannered tempi, especially in the Third, but his renditions are still valid in their own right.<br /><br />This boxed set also contains the two overtures and the Haydn Variations, all performed in ravishing performances. It also contains the Violin and Double Concertos with Gidon Kremer and Mischa Maisky. The one gripe - and I fear it's a serious one - is that Kremer made use of a renegade cadenza in the Brahms concerto by playing a Reger prelude rather than the Joachim cadenza. It hurts to think that he made use of such a cadenza, because it promotes an unbecoming clash of styles. Unfortunately, these three minutes of cadenza have ruined all the 38 minutes of the violin concerto.<br /><br />I also regret that this boxed set does not contain the two Piano Concertos with Krystian Zimerman. I know that Zimerman doesn't feel satisfied with any of his early recordings any more, but these two recordings really present an introspective side to these concertos. I also regret that this CD set doesn't contain Lenny's introductions to each work, as included on the forthcoming DVD releases of this Brahms cycle. Otherwise it would have been a really complete cycle and I would have given it a full rating.<br /><br />In short, it's a fine cycle, except that it doesn't contain everything related to Lenny's digital recordings of Brahms. These omissions seem glaring, but yet the performances are swell and worth considering at this price.
B000025XKM|5.0|Nick Drake's music for whatever reason fell in to my lap a few years ago and really did have a deep resonance in their impact. Pink Moon happened to be the first listened to and have been enjoying its beauty ever since. Like other reviewers 28 minutes seems to be a very short album but with repeated listens and as his lyrical execution and unique guitar playing persuasion hit your soul you find the 28 minutes could be easily 280 minutes such is the strength of focus the listener can expect from Nick Drake.    Highly recommended.

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has once again written a beautiful book. If you loved \\"The Kite Runner\\" like I did then you will surely love this book. Its another easy read, and just like the previous one the author takes the reader into Afghanistan and the perils of war. While reading I could envision everything to everyone because of Hosseini's detailed descriptions. The story revolves around two headstrong women and how their lives become intertwined with each other. I became just as emotional and involved in the story like before, didn't want the book to end. I highly recommend this book.
0374105235|5.0|Well written memoir.   Good to know what is going on in other parts of the world.   Darn shame that children can't be children in Sierra Leone.  I highly recommend this book.
B000NGV9EW|5.0|This entire series is well worth your time.  The books are quick and great for vacations, but are also quite informative since they are set in Botswana.  The characters are VERY FUNNY.  These books are in my top 10 and I'd highly recommend them to anyone.
1401900682|4.0|Just a caveat: There are only 12 cards in this pack. However, they are packed with powerful messages. I keep one propped by my bathroom mirror each day to remember the spiritual message throughout my day.
0634022296|5.0|By far one of the most \\"complete\\" compilation type songbooks I have bought thus far. Many guitar/piano songbooks covering various bands are almost always lacking the song you would like to do. This book is very thorough, and I find myself using it all the time.  It also is set up very simplistic. Easy to follow compared to others I have. Set up alphabetically for easy access to whatever song you would like to play. Highly recommended if you like playing some of the old Beatles stuff.
1416914285|3.0|Like a good many of City of Bones' readers, I picked it up because I'd read the author's well-known work in the Harry Potter fandom. I wasn't biased for or against City of Bones because of the fanfiction (I though CC's \\"Draco Trilogy\\" was good though I was never overly involved with it), but I was interested in reading something \\"original\\" that came from a source from whom I had previously only read fandom-stuff.    I was depressed with the lack of originality in City of Bones.    It's been said before, but the main male character of the novel, Jace, is jaw-droppingly similar to Cassandra Cla(i)re's version of Draco Malfoy, right down to worship/hating his evil blonde father. Practically every sentence he says, every description of his appearance (if you only alter \\"golden\\" for \\"silver\\") could have fit neatly into her Draco Trilogy.    Reading a fandom character on printed page irritated me, but I could have gotten past it if the rest of the book had been able to make up. But it didn't.    The world she created within 500 pages was huge, and the heroes visited or talked about countless aspects of it, yet I never felt it to be very well-developed. Huge amounts of boring backstory were packed tightly into long, exposition-filled monologues and supporting characters danced in and out of scenes without ever giving the reader a sense of who they were. Even two of the main characters, Isabelle and Alec, are given relatively little actual development and vanish (along with another main character, Simon) long before the end of the book, surrendering the main stage to Jace and Clary.    And the ending itself was one of the most disappointing things I've read in a long time. I read it quickly and sceptically, convinced that the villain of the book, Valentine really was brainwashing Our Heroes, that a deeper truth would soon be revealed. No. It really was a completely tired and translucent plot-twist.    This may sound like a completely scathing review, but it's not. CassandraClare certainly has potential, but she needs to evolve past reliving the glory of her fandom Queenship and concentrate on developing her characters. Coming out of fandom - where the characters come half- or fully-developed for you - and into the real world of writing can be challenging in that respect, but I'm confident that she will manage it, and hopefully before she completes the Mortal Instruments Trilogy.
B000AM1TGC|5.0|I would give this album 16 stars if I could.  It might be my favorite progressive rock offering of all time, approaching perfection.    This one represents all the finest aspects of the genre, with brilliantly creative arrangements supporting poetic lyrics and varied, lushly produced instrumentation.  People sometimes forget that this is also a concept album of a sort, as each tune represents a specific card in the Arcana of the Tarot.    It's all here, rock music built on a scale to rival classical music whilst emphasizing the best of both.  So many intense and lasting moments here, from the quixotic frenzy of Ace of Wands to the manic, ominous feel of A Tower Struck Down (is that a tape of a Nazi Nuremberg rally at the end, with the crowd bellowing \\"Sieg!!! Heil!!!\\"?  I think so.) to the delicate vocal by Steve himself on The Hermit... and that's just side one.  Of course side 2 is just sublime, with one of Phil's greatest-ever vocal performances on Star of Sirius, the luscious classical-flavored piece The Lovers (wherein the end section of The Hermit spins backwards), and the unspeakably magnificent closer Shadow of the Hierophant, featuring Sally Oldfield's regal vocal and perhaps the most archetypal mellotron blasts in music history.  The bass pedals in this song (remastered beautifully) will make your woofers fall on the floor if taken at at a sufficient volume.  One of the best things about this record for me has always been the gorgeous flute of John Hackett, he is all over these songs and just plays his bollocks off throughout in stunning fashion... his part at the aforementioned conclusion of The Hermit is the sonic equivalent of watching a leaf twist gently in the breeze as it tumbles to Earth.    So many highlights, the songs woven together so masterfully, just a high watermark of prog in particular and music in general.  An album I return to again and again, and will until the day I die.

1400063515|3.0|NNT (as he calls himself) has some fascinating points and some interesting turns of phrase, though he does rather go on and on and on.... Leaving aside the long-winded somewhat self-absorbed writing style, NNT makes some interesting points that he illustrates well. He discusses the problems with the fact that humans seek validation for what they think (rather than challenging themselves) and why we cannot predict well in many circumstances. He spends a lot of time discussing the problems inherent with the use of a bell curve to predict things where the impact of extreme events really matter. Finally he spends (too little) time on what to do about all this. I took a few key points away from the book:<br />- It is better, perhaps, to try and be generally right rather than precisely wrong<br />- Beware of looking for more rules than really exist<br />- Watch out for a tendency to prepare for \\"last war\\"<br />- Rare and consequential events can be much more important than the \\"normal\\" stuff in the bell curve<br />- Some things (that he calls \\"mediocristan\\") are such that the most typical is average and single instances don't impact the total much<br />- Others (he calls these \\"extremistan\\") are more winner-takes-all kinds of environments where extreme events matter most<br />- He makes the point that a thousand days cannot prove you right but one can prove you wrong<br /><br />There's more but it's a very long book and I am not going to attempt to summarize the nuggets spread throughout it here. Be prepared for a slog if you want to get everything you can out of the book - it goes on and on. 3 stars to average out 1 star for length and incoherence in places and 5 stars for some great content.
0451529308|5.0|It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor.  At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals,  but it is so much more.  Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today.  For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand.  In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era.
0142002038|5.0|Years ago when I first read Ian Fleming's Doctor No, I loved it. Having read it again recently, I think it is still one of the best Bond stories. The characters are unforgettable - Bond's trusty companion Quarrel, the beautiful Honey Rider, and the nefarious Doctor No. The tale has a great Caribbean setting and possibly the best challenge for Bond to face, i.e., the obstacle tunnel designed by Doctor No so he can test the endurance of the human species. This is a Bond story that you should certainly not miss.
0061142026|3.0|Several people recommended this author, and after seeing the previews for the movie I finally decided to read this book, and I had high expectations for it.  Overall it was an interesting and original fairy tale, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews, except for a couple of sex scenes this read like a young adult book.  He introduces many interesting characters but then doesn't tell you much about them. I felt like I was holding the magic candle that he describes in the book, it helped the holder cover vast distances with a few steps, I wanted to stop and get to know these characters and their backgrounds but instead I just got glimpses of them, until finally I reached the too easy to predict ending.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Looks absolutely perfect, sounds absolutely perfect. Definitely a nice upgrade from the standard DVD version of the film and worth the extra money for this version of it. Despite the gritty film style of the movie, the high-definition versions of it have a clarity and crispness that in my opinion really add to the graphic novel feel of the film.     Very happy with the purchase. If you have a Blu-Ray player, you owe it to yourself to have this movie in your library.
0425200450|5.0|The plot is intricate, fascinating and suspense filled.  You will find yourself turning page after page to discover what could possible happen next.  The plot moves fast and the conversations are full of clues.  Pay close attention.  Enjoy.    If you are new to the mystery genre or if you have never read this book, even if you have seen the movie -- you must read this book.  It is a true masterpiece of mystery writing.
1591841666|4.0|\\"The Dip\\" by Seth Godin is a short book with a message that resonates close to the issue of the \\"honeymoon period\\" that many people have with projects, companies, and relationships. The author's basic hypothesis is that anything that is worth doing usually starts off with a period where efforts lead to rewards but that soon turns into a high effort / low reward situation for a while before it picks up a faster pace and heads back up...sometimes way up.<br /><br />Plotting effort vs. reward on a graph, you see the line take a \\"dip\\" after the initial period and that's the reason for the title. The author indicates that it is precisely in the Dip that too many people quit, and never actually get to the point of becoming so good at what they do that they can then enjoy the rewards that come later. He says that this is an important barrier that helps separate the truly committed from the not-so-committed ones. He also says that most work starts out feeling like \\"Dip\\" projects but some of them are actually \\"Cliffs\\" which may have a longer growth period but never recover from the steep downturn at the end. Additionally, some projects are \\"Cul-de-Sacs\\" where you continue to put in effort but never get any reward or get anywhere.<br /><br />Seth provides examples to help identify the three types of situations and provides some guidelines on how to decide when to quit Cliffs or Cul-de-Sacs. I'm not sure the guidelines are that good, but I think the concepts of Dip, Cliffs, and Cul-de-Sacs are pretty real. Most people that quit probably do so either because suffering the dip is not worth the potential rewards later in their minds, or they have decided that the situation is a likely Cliff or Cul-de-Sac.<br /><br />Overall a good book that is short and easy to read and provides a good framework for making personal and professional decisions.
0425200469|5.0|Death on the Nile is a masterpiece of mystery.  Put a beautiful young celebrity who inherits great wealth in a love triangle.  Then provide a backdrop of a very memorable Egypt and drop in Hercule Poirot.  Now you have the chemsitry and ingredients for a terrific mystery.      As the plot unfolds and you finish a chapter, you will find yourself setting down the book to think through what the latest twists and turns may mean.      Don't miss reading this. You can do a lot worse, but not much better.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Oh my gosh!  If you loved the first Celtic Woman DVD, you will double-love this new one! Mairead will amaze and delight you with her incredible fiddling as well as dancing talents - how does she do that?!  Newcomer, Hayley, immediately won me over with her clear shining tones.  Lisa remains my favorite as she shares her very heart in her songs.  Loved the costume changes, and the castle setting was absolutely spectacular!!  Can't wait for the next one!

B000G75AE8|1.0|Anyone that loves \\"Diablous in Musica\\" or \\"God Hates us All\\" will be dissapointed with this cd. Whenever a band takes a long time off and try to make a come back with new album it blows. For example bands usualy say it took them long time to write tracks/record ,they spent lots of hours on the album and whenever you hear \\"Most effort they ever put in to this whole project\\" it translates to we're running out of original ideas and the whole CD is gonna be crap. This cd it looked like they made in week or two, the quaility of the sound is sooo damn shiity, if a rendom band from the street would bring their demo it would of probably sound a alot better. None of the tracks stand out and it's gotta be the worse cd Slayer ever made. I think it's that time for Slayer to finally retire or just tour but don't put out any more crap like this.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I had rented it and then I bought it.  It has great action sequences and a good story.  Up until now I have hated Daniel Craig since I saw him in Road to Perdition (he was so evil).  I loved how smooth he was in this story and the hard edges that gave him such humanity.  This is so much better than the over the top spectacles the last few Bond movies have been and the action while grandiose kept me interested.  Eva Green is one of the better Bond girls with more brains and all the sex appeal of her predecessors.  Judi Dench who I thought was a strange choice for M is very interesting here.  All in all it was some good entertainment.
B0000027RL|5.0|I just picked this album up again recently and started listening to it, and I can't put it down.    I bought this album shortly after it came out because of all the hype.  with the exception of the songs that made it on MTV and radio, I wasn't all that impressed.  It was a rare listen for me for quite some time.  Then in 1998 in college, on a whim, I went with a friend to a midnight release party of Yield and bought it.  I didn't have any other PJ albums at the time.  That album was really good, so I started working my way backward through their catalog.  that really got me back into them, but I never really gave Ten another good listen.  Now here it is, nearly  10 years after Yield, and I am only now realizing the genius of Ten.    This is easily their most consistent album to date.  You won't find any of their experiments that would start appearing in later albums... like \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\".  this album is great start to finish.    Let's forget about the singles all together.  People that I know didn't get into PJ for the simple reason that they felt songs like Alive and Jeremy were overplayed and overhyped.    the last 5 tracks of the album stand alone as great tracks all their own.      Oceans is a great slower song that could've been written by R.E.M.    Porch rocks just as hard as Evenflow, and does it without pop hooks.    Garden starts off as a low key ballad and builds to as heavy a grunge sound as Soundgarden, but more subtle.    Deep is a straight up grunge rock song that gives us a taste of what the Stone Temple Pilots would deliver with Core.  My new favorite track on the album.      Release is a great closer, and really shows their softer side.  the precursor to songs like \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town.\\"    Listen to this album again, and really listen.  don't just skip from Evenflow and Alive to Black and Jeremy and move on.  Their first album can still hang with anything they have done since.
0823013626|5.0|This book has been long awaited, and fulfilled every dream I had.  It is so practical and beautiful and I have almost worn out the cover from folding and re-reading.  I LOVE it!!
B00003CWPL|5.0|Wow!  This is an amazing flick.  I had seen parts of this years ago and was eager to own the entire version.  This is an incredible example of dream logic and sequencing.  The symbology is highly esoteric, but cohesion starts developing when analogies and metaphors begin to repeat.  Parts of the film seem long-winded or over-dramatic, but all-in-all it's terrific.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  Beautiful images.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|This is what a comic book movie should be! Spider-Man 3? It's got nothing on TMNT! This was fun, exciting, and hysterical! It was everything a TMNT movie should be... and more!<br /><br />See, there are two TMNTs. There's the comics and then there's the cartoon. The movies never really counted. The comics were original, cool, exciting, interesting - everything an independent comic about 4 fighting turtles should be! Now, the cartoon was great too! It made it more accessible for kids (the comics were definitely for older readers) and fleshed out the more fun side of the turtles but it was still great TMNT action! The movies, well, they plane stunk.<br /><br />But now, we've got a great TMNT movie that blends the best of the comics and the cartoon into one fun-filled 90 mins! The CGI is tops, with great action sequences (we're talking actual sequences where you can tell what the hell is going on. Could you do that in Spider-Man 3? No!), amazing visuals, cool editing, and a great palette of colors and designs. Add to that good voice acting, a great story, excellent directing, and you've got a really good movie... and a hellavu good TMNT movie!<br /><br />That said... I'm so going to be in the theaters for TMNT 2! Bring on the Shredder!
B00005R5G9|4.0|Fans of the 80s movies will probably enjoy it the most. Fans of John Hughes should like it for sure. A light romantic adventure comedy with Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall that is nicely done. James Spader is a decent jerk and the rest the cast including Estelle Getty add some nice elements. A young man can't seem to find his purpose until a female mannequin comes to life and tells him how to do the best he can at what he enjoys, window dressing. He then finds he is getting an abundance of attention and some of it is serious. He must figure a way to keep the secret of his mannequin and get them both out of harms way. I highly recommend this to fans of 80s romantic comedies.
0618680004|1.0|This book gives the reader an amusing glimpse into what passes for atheist \\"thinking\\" in some minds.  Reading the reviews for this book gives the reader an eye-opening look at how many people are taken in by such rubbish.  It seems that the title \\"free-thinker\\" has become a bit outmoded if people are praising this half-baked concoction of unedited pseudo-philosophical rants and unapologetic self-glorification.    The most important problem for an atheist to overcome when challenging theists of the western world is to debunk the alleged Resurrection of Jesus Christ.  It is precisely in the attack on this alleged miracle, precisely where the battle lines have been drawn between Christians and the rest of the world for 2,000 years that Dawkins attack is weakest, and for his failure at this most important juncture, I rate this book at 1 star.      First of all, Dawkins tries to disqualify all miracles out of hand because they are violations of the laws of nature.  Of course, IF all that exists is nature, then a violation of its laws would necessarily be impossible.  However, this is the most obvious case of a question-begging argument imaginable.  Dawkins seems to have in mind an argument such as this: people think they see miracles, so they believe in God. Also, people wouldn't believe in God if they didn't think they saw miracles.  Miracles are impossible because the laws of nature are inviolable (which is really another way of saying there is nothing outside of nature that can inject anything into nature.)  Therefore, people should not believe in God.  Obviously this entire argument rests on Dawkins unproven and undefended assumption that there is nothing outside of nature, exactly the thing that he seeks to prove.  This argument is wholly unconvincing.      Further compounding the problem is the fact that the entirety of Dawkins attack on miracles seem to rest on some sort of \\"David Hume said so and I'm standing by him\\" platform, which, unfortunately has been the platform of choice ever since \\"On Miracles\\" was written.  However, this argument (what Dawkins calls \\"David Hume's pithy test for a miracle,\\" which, in and of itself betrays a misconception since Hume's formula is a matter of applying a historical methodology, not a scientific evaluation) has been thoroughly refuted by many people, perhaps best by C.S. Lewis in his work entitled \\"Miracles\\" where it was shown that for Hume's criteria to be employed in the first place one must hold the position that the laws of nature operate uniformly throughout all of history, which, again is what Dawkins is asserting without proof.  Dawkins' argument against miracles involves using Hume's circular argument to argue himself in a circle.  Regardless of the overwhelming popularity of this dizzying method of argumentation to \\"disprove\\" the existence of God that has been growing ever since Hume wrote \\"On Miracles\\" and especially since Nietzsche gave it some lustre in the late 1800's, the fact still remains that it is bad philosophy and it fails to prove anything.    Now it should immediately become clear why Dawkins does not delve into the issue of Jesus' alleged resurrection more fully.  Because Dawkins thinks he has somehow proved that miracles are impossible, either through belief in his own unquestioned philosophical materialism or from his belief in... David Hume's unquestioned philosophical materialism, it is clear (to him) that Jesus couldn't possibly have risen from the dead.  Taking this philosophical rubbish for a knockdown argument, Dawkins further treatment of the resurrection claim is woefully inadequate.  After citing C. S. Lewis' famous \\"Lunatic, Liar or Lord\\" trilemma (since Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, he must have been either right or else insane or a liar\\"), he urges \\"his own\\" brilliant fourth option, claiming that Jesus was probably just honestly mistaken, and then takes the further trouble to remark that there is no good historical evidence that Jesus thought he was divine in the first place.      Here is a prime instance of  Dawkins philosophical inanity on display for all to see.  Dawkins fourth option is included in the trilemma in the \\"lunatic\\" category because any human who is not God and yet claims to be the one God, creator of the universe, is, perhaps by definition, an insane person.  Dawkins is unable to pentrate this unfathomable mystery, but still he tries to leave himself an escape route with his disclaimer.  Unfortunately Dawkins doesn't trouble himself to explain why Jesus was actually crucified if it were not the perfectly plausible reason given in the Biblical acounts that he was condemned for blasphemy, that is, claiming equality with God, precisely the thing Dawkins denies that he ever did.  Dawkins owes it to us to give us a more likely theory of why Jesus was crucified, when the inference to the best explanation would seem to be to take the alleged eye-witnesses at their word.  Instead Dawkins runs off into left field, quoting the most absurd authors who have ever written on the subject of Jesus' life and showing remarkable ignorance about the history of the early church.    The rest of the book is a loose collection of off-the-wall thoughts and comments (\\"The Great Prayer Experiment\\"??? Are you serious), with a liberal smattering of complimentary praise of himself and his books written by others, a shockingly elementary exposition of his ethical views, topped off with a dash of pseudo-scientific/philosophical speculation about answers to the ultimate questions.  To a Christian however, which was almost certainly his target audience, the entire book amounts to agreeing with a single verse of the Bible.  \\"if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.\\" (1 Cor. 15:14).  Since every Christian knows this already, this book is likely to produce little more than yawns and laughs to the people Dawkins most desperately wants to convert.  Until Dawkins comes up with a more powerful challenge to the claim of the resurrection miracle than \\"David Hume told me so,\\" this book is of extremely limited value in the scope of the atheist cause (despite what the bunch of fuming \\"Dawkinsians\\" on this review page might say to the contrary).  Instead of Dawkins unconvincing panegyric to himself, I would strongly recommend \\"Did Jesus rise from the dead? : the resurrection debate\\" (Antony Flew, Gary Habermas) as a work of serious philosophy on the subject of the veracity of religion and miracles.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I have enjoyed much of BonJovi's music for many years.  This CD is certainly not a disappointment!  I am a country music fan...so the slight country sound of this CD was interesting to me...but I have found you don't have to be a country fan to enjoy it. There is a very nice mix of music...from the soft gentle Make a Memory to the really fun upbeat party song..We Got It Going On...it just seems to get better each time I hear it!
B0000A118M|5.0|I have heard if \\"A Love Supreme\\" a lot of times;Many musicians have spoke or even sang of this work.I wanted to hear it.  \\"A Love Supreme\\"is a master's work.It has the unusual quality in that you can intently listen and try to digest the sheet of notes Coltrane could deliver so fluidly,yet it is relaxing enough that you can play it and not focus it and find it enjoyable.A very pleasant paradox!  Any complaint I can offer is that it is so brilliant that it will take a few repeated listnings to be able to grasp its scope.Then you will find yourself suddenly humming pieces of this at any given time during the day.  It is just so\\"musical\\"This work is full of emotion and feeling.  Buy this and listen to it at least 3 times entirely and see if you are not singing Coltrane in your head!
B00005JPLW|5.0|I can't get enough! I absolutely LOVE this movie.

And MAN! are the hot bodies in this movie HOT! I love the narration, the VERY VERY preciseness of the storytelling is pure genius! It keeps your heart pounding! HONESTLY...IT'S LIKE LIVING OUT AN AWESOME NOVEL! I can surely see the time that was put into the thoughts and emotions of this movie. It is a TRULY MUST SEE! I am so glad we have these minds at work out there, with the awesome talents surrounding them, to create the wonderful movies they do!!! It yet another reason to look forward to tomorrow. Really! I love movies that much! Movies like this....even more so!<br />Oh...and I must say that King Leonidas...WHOA! I have to admit...Gerard Butler is an attractive man...but King Leonidas...OH MY LORD! WHEW! no..DOUBLE WHEW! They did an awesome job making ALL the soldiers EXTREMELY attractive! (CAG, their physique, and costumes) Nothing like so super hot, courageous men!

B00005JPQR|5.0|THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the final film in what has been an amazing and action-packed trilogy of thrillers based on the late Robert Ludlum's novels featuring the same characters and plot. Matt Damon has turned in some of the best work in his career in these movies. He appears at once as invincible and unstoppable as Jason Bourne, yet is also vulnerable and lost.<br /><br />In the first movie, fans learned that Jason Bourne was just a pseudonym and not the character's true name. In this movie, we finally find out what the character's name really was. Of course, those people who have already read the books knew that.<br /><br />The first two movies, to a degree, paced the action and played to the tension in scenes.  THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM goes for the throat on action sequences from the very beginning. But there are still some brilliant twists and turns to the plot that will catch the audience off balance.<br /><br />Julia Stiles reprises her role as Nicky Parsons, a CIA agent who believes Bourne and sympathizes with him. Joan Allen plays Pamela Landy, a CIA supervisor clever enough to catch Bourne - or to help him find out what exactly was done to him. Both of these women are strong and individual in their roles even though they aren't allowed much screen time.<br /><br />David Strathaim is absolutely marvelous as Noah Vosen, the evil CIA mastermind fans of the series have come to enjoy hating.  His acting is spot on and his deviousness is purely Machiavellian.<br /><br />But the thing that really drives this movie is the pedal-to-the-metal action.  Once the movie rips into motion, it simply does not slow down.  Although two hours in length, the movie breezes by and is gone before you're ready.  Although it is intensely satisfying.  Bourne's opponents aren't the only ones capable of devious and twisted action.<br /><br />Even though he's been hunted, Jason Bourne is a relentless predator.  He asks no quarter and gives none, totally merciless when dealing with those who would do harm to him.  He's the kind of hero every guy wants to be and every woman wants to fall in love with.  The fight scenes, the chase scenes in cars and on motorcycles, the marathon races across rooftops and through apartment buildings are physically demanding and look great on screen.  Evidently Damon did a lot of his own stunt work when he could.<br /><br />The film was also shot on numerous locations, giving it a spectacular visual appeal.  Scenes were shot in New York City, England, France, Germany, Morocco, Spain, and India.  The story's pacing burns through the terrain, though, but you can immediately tell he was shot on location.<br /><br />The stunt crew must have had a field day with this one.  All the dazzling escapes, explosions, and chase sequences are extremely well choreographed and look great on the screen.<br /><br />Personally, I felt this movie was a little less plot-dense then the other two.  There was more of a linear progression in this one, without all the side stories.  We knew Bourne was being hunted, and we knew that Vosen was the bad guy.  But everything tied together and made sense.<br /><br />At the same time, some of the scenes strain credulity.  Not the action sequences, because I was willing to go along with those.  But in one instance, Bourne was able to break into Vosen's office without being caught.  We never got to see that happen, and I can't believe it would be so easy that he would do it in a matter of minutes while hey were hunting him.  The security in that place, even before the threat of Jason Bourne being in the city, had to have been extremely high.  Not just mechanical security devices, but also human guards.  It was a great plot twist to have Bourne invade Vosen's office, but I really had to stretch to believe it could happen.<br /><br />The world seems to have rediscovered Robert Ludlum through these movies.  Several of the late author's novels have been recently reprinted, and there's even a new film adaptation of THE CHANCELLOR MANUSCRIPT underway starring Leonardo DiCaprio.  It seems as though Hollywood has finally figured out how to make realistic spy thrillers and is doing a bang-up job of choosing source material the same way Quentin Tarantino did when reinventing the crime thriller using Elmore Leonard's books.<br /><br />I'm waiting to buy the Bourne movies when they come out on HD DVD.  The first two have already been released in that format. But I'm holding out for a collector's set of all three. I'll probably have those, though, when Matt Damon decides to do a fourth movie in the series. Two new Jason Bourne novels have already been written by best-selling author Eric Van Lustbader. A fourth movie would disrupt my collected set, but I would be happy to see another one.gh Hollywood has finally figured out how to make realistic spy thrillers and is doing a bang-up job of choosing source material the same way Quentin Tarantino did when reinventing the crime thriller using Elmore Leonard's books.

0385733577|5.0|Fifteen-year-old twins Sophie and Josh Newman don't believe in legends. What good would it do them anyway? Their parents are away the whole summer on one of their archeological digs, and right now all the twins care about is working hard at their new summer jobs to save money for their own car. By some stroke of luck, they find jobs in San Francisco across the street from each other --- Sophie at The Coffee Cup and Josh at The Small Book Shop. Books and coffee, an ideal combination if ever there was one.<br /><br />On the surface, Nick Fleming and his lovely wife Perry seem like your typical bookstore owners. But then a strange group of men step out of a limousine at the curb, gray-faced golems lumber into the shop, the air smells like peppermint and rotten eggs, and explosive balls of energy get hurled through the air. Before Josh and Sophie even figure out what's happening, Nick and his wife kidnap them for their own good and flee the scene worried for their lives.<br /><br />It seems that Josh's boss is not who he claims to be. Nick and Perry are really Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, and their secrets don't stop there. Records show that Nicholas Flamel was widely regarded as the greatest Alchemyst of all time. His wife died first, and in 1418 he followed her to the grave, nearly 600 years ago. If all this is true, then why are their graves empty?<br /><br />Somehow, the Alchemyst is still alive.<br /><br />Rarely have I read a novel that accomplishes as much as THE ALCHEMYST. By the author's own admission, the twins are the only invented characters; everyone else is grounded in history and mythology. The famous alchemyst Nicholas Flamel really married Perenelle. John Dee studied as his apprentice. The mysterious Book of Abraham was a real book made of bark. And to this day, Nick and Perry's graves lie empty. How did they get so rich? What happened to their bodies? Could they still be alive?<br /><br />A skillful weave of history and legend, the first installment of this story leaves few ancient myths unexplained --- The Greek legend Icarus, the Great London Fire, the Viking god Odin, vampires, the Black Plague of Europe, the Island of Atlantis, the Irish Potato Famine, martial arts, witches, the Philosopher's Stone, and the secret of eternal life --- amazingly, though, none of them feels out of place. They help transform this fast-paced rollercoaster of magic, mystery and myth into a new legend that explains the stories of the past and holds the secret to all the ones to come.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens<br /><br />© Copyright 1997-2007, Teenreads.

0061186422|4.0|What a lot of people seem to miss when complaining about this book is that it was assembled for younger readers. This book was made in the style of Ray Bradbury's R Is For Rocket. It's primary function is to introduce younger readers to Gaiman's work. All the stories here I would feel comfortable with my children reading, while most of the titles from Fragile Things, I might hesitate. This book does contain some repeat stories, some hard-to-find material, and some new stories, as well. Read this book to get a sneak peek at Neil's new book, The Graveyard Book. All in all, a wonderful book, and I'm thankful for it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I just had to chime in in defense of this DVD and offset the one star by Brad.     Roger is that really you penning under the name of Brad King? Brad if it is - I'm enjoying the fact that you display your ignorance for the world to see. Roger, left the band after the Final Cut album almost 2 decades ago. I imagine this to you is no different then when Syd left the band and the nay sayers wouldn't have anything to do with Floyd without \\"him\\".  Gilmour had his hand in arranging most of the music the Floyd did, along with singing his fair share of songs, and any idiot knows that Rogers forte wasn't musical composition (just listen to his solo album Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking) but rather lyrics. Amazing how the Floyd and Gilmour's solo efforts have managed to stay in the forefront for the past 2 decades with out him.     As for your review based purely upon spite without even seeing the disk - well every village needs an idiot. Brad thanks for being ours.

0156711427|1.0|I wanted to like this classic but I gave up after Chapter 6. I found the characters confusing and couldn't relate to the story or understand a lot of the terminology used. I didn't feel compelled to make a study of it. I loved Mistry's A Fine Balance and hoped for a similarly well-developed story and characters.
B000001AFY|5.0|This is (without a doubt) a classic Diana Ross album.  Mellow ballads that touch the heart and soul, Jazzy tunes of LOVE and Devotion, and heart throbbing dance songs that stir the senses!  Truly a master piece of musical talent that only Diana Ross could deliver.  This album will be remember in the pantheon of music as the finest of the 1970's.  If you're not fortunate enough to have experienced this DIANA ROSS album on vinyl, 8-track tape, cassette tape, or Reel to Reel.  Now is your chance on compact disc.  It's Just WONDERFUL!
0877284520|1.0|After reading the book The Tarot Handbook by Angeles Arrien, in which she gives detailed descriptions of the very beautiful artwork on the Thoth deck designed by Aleister Crowley and painted by Lady Francis Harris, I purchased this deck expecting the cards to be as described in the book. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed upon receiving this deck. Most cards were only one color, looking bland. Artwork details were unrecognizable due to the lack of color variation. I returned the deck but am still interested in purchashing the colorful cards described in the book if found.
B000QXDED6|2.0|If you like history this ain't it. This is a made for video game movie. It is slightly better than I can imagine \\"Pong the Movie\\" would be though.
0375703764|5.0|I'll begin by trying to expose what this book is \\"about\\". A family moves in to a house in Virginia. Because the father of this family is a photographer and film-maker, he decides to put cameras everywhere for a real-life experience sort of thing. Then strange things happen. The house is apparently bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Then there's even a new door opening on the sheer unknown. I'll say no more on this, but eventually, Navidson, the father, edits all this into a movie. Later on, a man named Zamapanò writes \\"House of Leaves\\" which is about this documentary-film made by Navidson. Then, that document is found by Johnny Truant, who introduces the book and writes notes for it. And much more.    So basically what you get is 2 stories: the Navidson story with the house and its numinous mystery, and the Johnny Truant autobiographical parts. Of course, all of these are characters, and don't be fooled by the book description in the jacket or by the \\"second edition\\" because both of these are part of the story, not of our \\"reality\\".    For most of the book, I really thought it was incredibly good. There's a lot of good \\"horror\\" styled elements, and as an academic, I found it quite amusing all the play on footnotes and references to both real and bogus books and authors. If you're a lit student, you'll get some fun from those parts.    I personally preferred the Navidson story per se than the Truant stuff, though that is good too; but I just found myself sighing every time one of his giant footnotes came up. It's hard to give a well-balanced opinion on this novel. It's definitely an intriguing read and there are excellent things by the tonload, but you do get confused in some parts, namely the Truant stuff, where you don't really know what's happening, which I guess is intentional and part of the whole \\"going crazy in meaninglessness\\" deal.    It's greatly written, though, and it's certainly thought-provoking in more ways than one. At first I was afraidthis novel would be nonsense upon nonsense, but it wasn't so. Be unafraid, it's absolutely readable; yet there are parts which are trickier, but you won't fail to note they were meant to be so. Up until page 500 or beyond, I forget, I thought that this was genius work, and I still think that it is. My only negative feedback is the following.    I think it was a daunting task to give that novel a proper ending, and in some ways, I think it didn't work here. In fact, and that may save the novel in my eyes, there's not really an ending. I mean, there definitely IS, don't get me wrong, there is an ending, but it's not all that satisfying, and I don't mean to say too much about it. There are many ends to this, I guess, and like a labyrinth, which it is written to look like, there's not really an end ever.    \\"House of Leaves\\" is probably this century's - or the past one's - \\"Moby Dick\\". It has the same experimental taste, albeit a century and a half later, and it seeks the impossible White Whale too. I can't say \\"numinous\\" enough when talking about this, or that, novel. And if you don't know that word \\"get thee to your OED\\" because that's one important word.    So, to sum up, this is an excellent book and certainly something you've never quite experienced before.

0060899190|5.0|This has got to be the most unusual book I have read; almost 300 pages of secrets.  People from all over and all walks of life mailed in post cards sharing their secrets with Frank Warren, then eventually with everyone who chose to pick up his book.<br /><br />There are secrets about everything from masturbation, rape, adultery, hatred, love, children, loneliness and more.  Some secrets are sad, others disturbing, some are funny and silly, others are loving; it is amazing how one sentence on a post card can hold so much emotion.  I giggled a little while reading this book and I even shed a few tears.<br /><br />Post Secret is a great coffee table book; I picked it up off my brother's one night and couldn't put it down, I ended up bringing it home with me.  It is a quick and easy read; I think it took me all of an hour, cover to cover.  The post cards are little pieces of art, and people really put time and effort to design one that reflected their secret.  Some of the secrets I could relate to, others I was shocked that anyone could think or do that.<br /><br />This book really made me think about my secrets and would I have the guts to mail one in?  Hell, no! ;)  But it's fun to read everyone else's!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Just think. The following will not contain any explanantion of this film whatsoever. It's a provocative message. I have my understanding of this film. If you don't have one then get your goddamn self off of this freaking page, and watch it, you cheap low-life. This is the most intellectually brilliant film of our time, besides, of course, THE SHINING which is the greatest movie ever made (I don't want to sound like a Nazi, but that isn't my opinion, its a damn fact), and some other films like Bergman fellini desica, TCM(1974) Martin(1977)... but anyway. Think about the lead actors. Think about the director, and who he is (an intellectual who doesn't beleive in god, as we all shouldn't and I certaintly don't). Think about the last words that kubrick wrote in the script. Who is the piano player, and who does he represent. Who is that damn dark figure in the nightclub bar behind where cruise meets the piano player!!!!!!!! Think about why Kubrick didn't make the orgy scene erotic like a porno, but actually boner-less(unless your a six year old or something). Think about that little picture that is behind cruise on the wall, while he finds out about the aids. Think about the title, for \\"god's\\" sake(get it, \\"god's\\"). Think about why throughout the movie, cruise and kidman are never sober, the're high, drunk, and are constantly drugged up? Is this what our society has become, a mental pleasure cruise, in which nobody can accept reality, and escapes through drugs(though I love them) and alcohol(that too). One girl even escapes by dying. Why do those kids beat on cruise(even while he wears that beautiful overcoat)!!!!!!!!!!!! What does the newspaper say? Why is Mozarts requiem playing(a funeral song) while nobody is clearly dying(or are they?) What is that blindfold. Why does he get a cappucino(no, that wasn't a joke, you should seriously try to understand that)!!!! What are the orgy scene lyrics saying(in English) obviously(unless your some illegal chink or somehing) And why the f69k is it Christmas?
0618680004|5.0|this is a challenging work and I admire Richard Dawkins for putting himself out there to be hounded by the religious bigots who will no doubt be after his hide.  clearly a man who has thought through every aspect of his work and offers complete proof for every word ....... no blind 'beliefs' here.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Those buying \\"Black Snake Moan\\" simply to see Christina Ricci nude, or in bondage, will certainly find it...but this film isn't about sleaze, but healing, how anyone can change their lives with love, patience, and respect. This is the message you'll leave the film with...and it beats titillation!<br /><br />The story tells of three 'broken' souls; a bitter ex-blues singer/farmer (Samuel L. Jackson), coping with his wife running away with his brother; a young nymphomaniac (Ricci), her uncontrollable carnal urges the result of being raped, repeatedly, as a child; and a young soldier (Justin Timberlake), rendered nearly helpless by anxiety attacks. These three 'lost souls' are labeled and dismissed by the small southern community they live in, but through each other, they will find healing, and, ultimately, redemption.<br /><br />Yes, Ricci is chained by Jackson, but it isn't a sexual gesture, but a means to keep her from returning to the environment that had left her bloodied and unconscious, when he first found her. Yes, Jackson bathes and clothes her, but he is, fundamentally, a moral man, and he tells the minister of the local church exactly what he is doing, asking for guidance.<br /><br />So, potential viewer, if you want soft porn, look elsewhere...or better yet, BUY this; you may discover something far more worthwhile than you bargained for!<br /><br />Kudos to writer/director Craig Brewer, and his extraordinary cast!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Okay, I'd just like to say a few words in response to a couple of lower-star reviews. One star? Who would say that about Wicked? The music has one Tony Awards for goodness sakes! Not to mention that's a total insult to Stephen Schwartz! The music is wonderful. Pure Magic. Kristen Chenowith and Idena Menzel at their best, if you ask me. This musical is more than deserving of its many Tony's, and is worthy of respect, whether you like the musical or not. If one doesn't care for the style of music, or even the storyline, I still don't think they should be openly calling it \\"bad\\". It's true, this musical is a bit more modern, a real 21st Century piece. But this is the 21st Century after all, so welcome to the 21st century! It's about time something as awsome as this finally came into the world!
081541028X|4.0|It's been many years since I read this book as I purchased it shortly after it was initially published in paperback.  As I remember and I have to promise myself to reread it, this really is one of the finest if not the finest book written by an astronaut.  It really showed me what it was like to be part of the crew of the first landing mission to the moon even though it was \\"only\\" from the perspective of the guy who got to stay in orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin got all the glory from the surface of the moon.  I really believed that Collins really was comfortable with that role and never expected to get a landing assignment down the road.    Really great book.
0061139378|4.0|A children's book (12 and up), I read this primarily for its intriguing synopsis and its \\"easy factor\\". Even though I'd heard it was disturbing and much more mature than a kid's book, I wasn't quite expecting some of the elements that Gaiman introduced to his audience. For instance, a woman that sews buttons onto children's eyes, and who also gets rid of her husbands when she gets tired of them. I loved some of the themes the author approached, such as disposability, materialism, and the fallacies of love and obsession. Unfortunately, the themes were VERY lightly touched upon, and there were a lot of scenes that I wish had been expanded and described in more detail. There was too much repetition of ideas and words, but the originality of Gaiman's characters was spellbinding - most definitely a modern, if scary, fairy tale. But then again, most of the original fairy tales were disquieting in nature. (The sketch drawings interspersed within the text only adds to the intensity of the book). For kids, this is a beautiful story. For adults, however, it seems to be lacking.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|A perfect movie to watch on a snowy cold afternoon. My now 17 YO and I watched it on VHS and now my 3 YO and I watch it on DVD. The music is enchanting and the animation is pure art. It makes you want it to snow in August. An artistic Frosy the Snowman with a much deeper yet subdued story.
B00005JPRT|5.0|Saw this a few months ago; just listening to the soundtrack and find that the movie's images and music still give me goosebumps.  good stuff.  nuff said.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|I almost gave up on watching this movie.  After three tries I finally watched the whole movie.  The story line and historicity are fairly accurate.  However the acting is very poor.  My guess is in trying to incorporate an aura of mystery and secrecy into the scenes the producer went way overboard.  The viewer is often left with shadowy scenes, mumbling dialogue and disjointed melodrama. I was surprised that this was put out by Speilberg whose direction and movies I thoroughly enjoy - except this one.
B00005NS1D|5.0|Elton John has had tonnes of hits over all these years and he probably still has a few more to come but when it comes to full albums' worth of material clearly his most consistently good non-compilation collection of tracks must be \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\"  Released during a time of great creative explosion this album represents an artist at the top of his game.  But what makes this version of the album better than all the rest?  Well for starters the sound quality is very well remastered for an excellent sound given what must be the state of the original master tapes.  Also, the mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design is a real treat for fans as it is made from good quality cardboard and very faithfully recreates the original lp design.  Included is a 28-page booklet that has a very good essay on the album by producer Gus Dudgeon as well as all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  This is certainly the definitive version of the album that is currently out there.  Highly recommended!
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Once again the time has come for one of the 80's thrash metal gods to release a new album.  As usual, a lot of us have extremely high hopes in our minds that one of these new albums are gonna be a perfect return to form and be able to stand up to the all time greats such as \\"Rust In Peace\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", or \\"Number of the Beast\\".  United Abominations, like all other attempts, is not one of those albums, but that doesn't mean that this album doesn't diserve any respect.    So, is United Abominations an album worth buying?  If you're a Megadeth fan, definately.  If you're just a simple metal fan, then the answer is still probably yes.  Overall United Abominations offers itself as a good album.  I think it is of a more clutch album than \\"The System Has Failed\\", but not necessary really any better.  The really good songs stand out a lot more on the previous album, but UA offers more number of good songs and doesn't feel quite as rushed.  Dave seemed like he found a formula he liked while making this album and did a good job of sticking with it to the end.  But, I think that the only way you can really enjoy the UA experience is to go in listening to it as an album by itself.  Giving this album it's first listen while dwelling on thoughts of \\"Rust In Peace\\", \\"Youthenasia\\", or even something like \\"Cryptic Writings\\", is going to leave you dissapointed.  One of the main reason for this I believe is the lack of melody.  Many songs have a little too much of Dave just spatting out rants which fall somewhere in between him singing in his growl form and just talking fast.  One of the things that really made the 90's era albums stand out to me is their well constructed melodies.  Not all of the melody work on UA needs to be overlooked, though.  There are a few chorus moments that Dave really does shine through and offer us some awesome vocals.  I think most people can agree with me on this, that the thing that makes this a good album is the rythmn and lead work.  While, there isn't really anything mind blowing, every song pretty much has it's moment of decent riffs, and there's plenty of well thought out lead work to keep the hang banging.  I believe the only real problem with the rythmn work was that nothing really sounded new.  There are times when after only about 2 seconds of listening to a riff I was able to equate it to a more popular Megadeth release.      Anyways, I thinks that's enough blabber.  To sum things up I'll leave with saying that United Abominations is a good album worth buying, but it's not going to be anything life changing.  It does offer a lot of hope for the future of Megadeth, and that is definately something good.
1563890119|4.0|I somehow missed the boat on this series that began in 1988.  It ran through 1997, and some believe it is the greatest comic series to have ever existed.  I finally--FINALLY--decided I needed to check it out.<br /><br />Gaiman himself has admitted in the past that Preludes and Nocturnes was a bit of a rough start to a series that would later garner much acclimation, and he was correct.  Don't misunderstand though--I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  If it is considered a rough start, then I'm greatly looking forward to the more \\"polished\\" volumes!<br /><br />The character of Sandman has some sort of intangible appeal that I can't put my finger on.  For those who don't know much about him, he is the God of Sleep, an entity who often takes the form of a tall, thin, nearly translucent-skinned man with black eyes and black, unruly hair.  However, I absolutely understand what I like about his story potential.  In the first volume alone, his story unfolds over decades, he visits Hell, he walks the Earth, he rules in his dream kingdom, and he even spends some time with his cheery, charismatic sister Death.  The only thing about this first volume that struck me as almost too awkward was when Sandman interacted with the then-present incarnation of the Justice League.  This was before the Vertigo imprint was born and Sandman was given his own universe to play in.<br /><br />Sam Kieth was the original artist, but he left after only a few issues.  Some people love his work, others don't.  Personally, I enjoyed Mike Dringenberg's incarnation of Sandman much better.  Also, keep in mind these stories were produced in the late eighties, so the coloring isn't quite up to today's technological standards.<br /><br />However, it's obvious this is a very smart series and I can't wait to read the entire set.  I only wish I hadn't waited so long to give it a chance.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]

Dont split it in two!! I hope no one buys this and gets a bootleg copy of the real movie. This stinks!
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|Unfortunately, I have seen Firefly/Serenity and it is awful. It is good that the series is canceled because it is an insult to SciFi genre.<br />Whedon, just like Paul W.S. Anderson should be fired, and forbidden to write another script by law!<br />Whedon decimated an excellent Alien series with Resurrection, and Anderson dumped it to the toilet after with AvP!<br />I don't want to even mention Buffy or Angel - I don't know who watches that?<br />So, lets go back to the Firefly/Serenity. Its awful, how can it be a SciFi if you: 1-don't have aliens, 2-don't have the technology, 3-have cowboys?!?!<br />If you really want SciFi they you should watch \\"Star Trek\\", that WAS, IS and WILL BE the SciFi at its best.<br />Unfortunately it seems that overall viewer intelligence drop sharply in the last few years, and now people watch Firefly/Serenity-like series.<br />Muppet Show is more intelligent and fun.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|With all the negative buzz this album has received, one might think Kelly has commited career suicide releasing this disc.  On the contrary, this is a very solid album, and is not a radical departure from her sound.  How I Feel, Can I have a Kiss, Sober, and Maybe are worth a listen. My personal favorite, and most radio-worthy song on this album is One Minute (If she's smart, she will release this as a single).  However, while this is a quality album, I do agree with some reviewers who say this album desperately lacks bonafide hit songs and CATCHY HOOKS!.  Breakaway was as close to a flawless album as you can find in recent history.  I don't skip not one song on Breakaway; but My December has several songs that are skippable.  I give Kelly kudos on sticking to her guns and releasing the album she wanted to put out; but part of me thinks she should have listened to Clive on this one.  Kelly Clarkson is a once in a generation talent and will be around for years to come, nothing can keep her down for long.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|i love watching this show, the story is great, despite the fact that sometimes they talk waaaaaaaay too fast lol
B000LXHK22|4.0|Listen, no one is going to mistake this light, delicately filmed romantic comedy for Gladiator, but you have to analyze this film within the parameters of the genre.  For what it is, it is a charming, low-key slice of life movie that makes brilliant use of its glorious settings as well as its stars.<br /><br />One bonus for tennis fans -- several pivotal and life-changing scenes are played out on the old red-clay court on the grounds of the estate.  The scenes, like the film, are beautifully filmed and deftly played.
0312323867|5.0|This was a great read, and I highly recommend it if you enjoyed Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed\\". This answered the questions and explained the back story of the first book, and in my opinion, was not a 'predictable' story, which made it even better.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is based on a short lived SiFi series that generated quit a following. After watching the movie you will probably wonder why it was canceled. To tell the truth I have been wondering about that since the series was canceled. I do not have cable and the series that was competing with it stunk (both where late night), but some how this one was canceled and the other one continued on (what a drag). Watch an enjoy for this is probably the last time we will get to view this reality.
0440241413|4.0|It's chick lit, absolutely. A great funny escape. No profound insights or deep thoughts to be had here, but plenty of humour and entertainment; I have re-read it more than once and it still makes me laugh.
0446615625|5.0|Great characters - a story that spins and twist and is so well resolved in the end.  I want to read about these four main charaters (\\"The Camel Club\\") again
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I was one of those that was sorry to see Motograter go into an indefinite hiatus.  I found myself loving Ivan's project of Ghost Machine  I found myself elated to hear his amazing voice chiming alongside the unbelievable sound of The Bleeding on my local radio station.    This entire album is great...from the opening track to the end
0143038419|3.0|I enjoyed this book--I have to be honest, its strangely enjoyable to read about someone who has reached lower depths than oneself and came back unscathed.  Made me feel more normal. :)  She has a lovely writing style and the structure of the book makes it a great read for commuting...lots of short vignettes...or to pick up and put down at leisure.
B000Q6GXW2|2.0|I wait for a long time this movie, in this Format, And the movie Freezz from chapter 14, I own the HD-DVD of Xbox 360, I don`t know is that problem is only with my HD-DVD, But I read other reviews and it looks that they have the same problem.

B000R34V50|5.0|Just watched TMNT for the first time since theaters, on this awesome Blu-Ray disc.  Film looked great.  And though it wasn't the full 1080P, the quality of the picture was still quite clear to watch.  A great disc.
0446693804|3.0|I appreciated this book more than I thought I would, given that the writing style sometimes seemed overly precious, and the plot predictable and cliched.  Still, with all that, there is a basic goodness in the main characters, including Hegbert, that shines through even this treatment.  That's what prompted me to finish the book.  It brings us back to a supposedly simpler time, and is good, escapist fiction, which isn't necessarily bad.    On another point, I am amazed by number of reviewers here who assume as Gospel truth--no pun intended--that Jamie dies in the end.  Clearly, that's what happened in the movie.  However, Sparks's treatment of that possibility at the end in the book struck me as great deal more ambiguous.    Landon never removed his ring.  How did he put it?  He \\"never felt the need to.\\"  He *knows*, with the insight of 40 intervening years, that he would have married Jamie even if she weren't dying.  And, in the end, he knows \\"one thing that we don't know\\": that miracles do, indeed, happen.    Now maybe the miracle really is that Jamie changed his heart, brought two families together, and united an entire town. On the other hand, maybe the word means exactly what both Landon and Jamie always meant when they prayed for a \\"miracle\\":  Jamie recovered.  At least, the book never once states that she died.      As a final point, I've got to say that, if Landon indeed spent the next 40 years single and without children as a result of his wife of two weeks or so passing away when he was 17, then I don't see this as an example of True Love as much as I feel sorry for him.  No matter how much Jamie taught him, he missed out on a whole lot of life.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae is the definition of artist.  She's got everything going for her, the effortless chemistry with her music, the elegant beauty, the multitudes of honey-tipped talent and then there's that voice which just slides over your body like warm water, cleansing your soul with each and every well placed lyric.  It's hard to pigeon hole this star, classify her talent for on this UK bred beauty's eleven track debut she elegantly glides in and out of Jazz influenced R&B cuts and Hip-Hop laden Pop tracks with a touch of Soulful Contemporary class that her album becomes defined with only one word...music.  That's the way I like it though, an artist who can effortlessly evoke feeling no matter what style she embarks on, and while her music all has her signature touch her album never, and I mean never, falls into the rut of redundancy.<br /><br />She starts off very strong with the slow-tempo track `Like a Bird' where her words seem to coat the listener with her subtle sexuality.  In fact, it's in her softer tracks that she really shines above and beyond.  She does this again on `Till it Happens to You' where she invests a little Blues feel into her classic delivery.  This track in particular feels like it was pulled straight out of a smoky jazz club and placed in your living room.  On `Choux Pastry Heart' she delivers her finest track here (at least in my humble opinion) with her soft spoken whisper almost complimented by the ivory keys and guitar strings.  It just comes together to create a masterfully memorable musical experience.  Another effective track in those veins is `Butterfly' which is a brilliant example of the maturity Rae brings to her music, perfectly fusing modern R&B with the aged Jazz roots.<br /><br />But, intermixed with these soft mellow cuts are some very impressive up-tempo tracks, the first of which was her first single `Put Your Records On'.  It's spunky and catchy with nice bass lines and memorable lyrics.  As good as `Put Your Records On' is though, `I'd Like To' is better.  The beat is brilliant and her voice perfectly compliments the lyrical message.  It's a perfect example of her range and assumed longevity.  She'll be around forever with tracks like this.  `Trouble Sleeping' is another track that just screams for attention.  The Jazz feel to it is so effortless and captivating.  `Call Me When You Get This' has a very different feel to it than the rest of the album, and it adds just another layer to this already well diversified songbird.  The guitar work is a very nice touch.<br /><br />`Enchantment' is one of those songs that will really keep this star on the tip of everyone's tongue.  The song is just perfectly orchestrated, subtle and entrancing throughout the versus, soft and sweet throughout the chorus and then the brilliant Jazzed-up bridge just further perfects this track.  `Breathless' is just another slice of heaven, so Billie Holiday yet so Corinne Bailey Rae.  The chorus is just effortlessly brilliant.  Just sit back and close your eyes and engulf her magnetism.  The closing track `Season's Change' is a brilliant way to close with Rae doing what she does best, slowing things down and giving us her breathy ballad.  The beat here is even sublimely effective and helps set a mood and create one of her finest tracks.  It's always good to go out with a bang, that's what gets the listener to start the process all over again.<br /><br />So, the verdict is a simple one...buy it, embrace it, love it, recommend it.d Like To' is better.

B000K7UBTI|2.0|This was a boring movie. They needlessly ruined the Mandarin and turned him into some kind of ghost,and for what?The worst part of the movie was the voice characterization of Tony Stark.His breathy \\"I'm a sexy ladies man\\" was the most ruinous thing I've ever heard. Every time Stark opened his mouth, I expected him to start acting like Quagmire from The Family Guy.Giggidy,giggidy,goo.

B0000844I8|5.0|I loved the original, and this one is just as good, if not better.  I thought the new opening scenes helped to tie the storyline in later.  The other added scenes are subtle, and unless you've seen the original many times, you probably would have a difficult time noticing which scenes were added, but in my opinion, that's how good this movie is.  The added scenes help to give the viewer a fuller idea of the entire story.  About the extras on the disk, I wish there would have been more, like maybe some \\"making of\\" footage or interviews with the actors, producers, director, etc.  But I'm not complaining (very few films of that time have many extras when converted to DVD).  The one special extra they do have on the disk more than makes up for the lack of interviews, in my mind.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It'll make you think or re-think many ideas.  Overall, I'd highly recommend this version to anyone who liked the original Stargate movie.

6304779356|5.0|This movie rocks! It is the coolest of the teenage geek's nightmares. Watch it - if you like me live in a small town that just may have been infiltrated by vampires. It will give you top notch knowledge to defend yourselves. Miss it at your own peril!!! Enough said, it will help you rescue your misguided brothers from the hand of vampires. It will let you know that garlic is not enough; although it does help :-) On the other hand if you want to join the dark side, then by all means do drink the wine and have no fear of the funny so called fried rice. The choice is yours.

1573226521|5.0|Since I just came from summer vacation, and decided I ll try my luck at some light hearted reviewing, i couldn't resist reviewing one of my all time favorite books. What can I say. Original and gribbing and mmoody that it's one of a kind. I don't think Alex Garlan will ever know how to write a story this deep an dgripping again!
1594489505|3.0|Despite the hype that KH had repeated the 'Kiterunner' magic I had my reservation going into the read. I'm glad I did and so apparently avoided the disappointments many readers have expressed. This books rides off the inertia from THE KITE RUNNER. Given the historical timing of the book and the insight it offers into one of the most ill fated and troubled societies in modern history its success is guaranteed. But as a writer's craft do not foolishly expect to live through the freshness, the captivating quality and nuance of the Kite Runner. One can't help but think that a writer of KH's caliber could have done better. Parts of the book are drawn out. The descriptive elements of the writing come across as repetetive and mechanical. There are glimpses of the high ground that stayed so unbelievingly through The Kiterunner.    But if you are a KH fan and liked The Kiterunner then you will survive this book and even feel delighted at having read it.

0156013983|5.0|I place this on a par, in it's own way, with Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet.<br /><br />Deeply meaningful, cloaked in a tale of a child.  I read part of it at my mother's funeral.  Not that it is a sad story, per se.  But there was not a dry eye in the house when I finished.<br /><br />What it has to say on loving and on loss is absolutely worth more than this book costs and every minute you spend reading it.
076531178X|4.0|Wow. Mistborn impresses me on so many levels. It boasts both substance and style. The plot and characters are complex, the ideas are original, and the prose brims with emotion and precision. Right now, I would put Sanderson at the top of my must-read list of fantasy authors. This novel is that good.    So much about it feels fresh and thoughtful. For example, Sanderson creates a new system of magic in Allomancy. He also portrays characters with real, understandable emotions and agendas. For example, betrayal is never far from Vin's mind, and that insecurity impacts the story. Themes abound--betrayal, friendship, the dangers of power, the ambiguity of prophesy, class intolerance, religion, etc.--and they are handled with insight. Yes, the novel is about a prophesied hero like a lot of other novels; however, unlike most other novelists, Sanderson contemplates what that phrase means and how its truth or falsity can affect a world.    Like many other novels, there are also surprises. Again, unlike its counterparts, this novel's surprises make sense thematically and contextually. Often in novels and movies, I feel tricked by plot twists, as if they only exist for shock's sake. In this novel, the twists enrich the story. They illustrate the author's preparedness: He must have plotted the story carefully for the surprises to resonate so deeply.    Although I was tempted to give it five stars, the novel isn't perfect. At times, the pace is slow, and the action is disorienting at first. Actually, both of those flaws have explanations. I think that the novel moves slower than a bestseller because it makes you think--you cannot just breeze through the prose or you'll miss the texture. Similarly the Allomantic fights are confusing because they should be: after all, Vin is new to Allomancy, so the design matches the context. I also thought that Sanderson could have spent more time on how Kel brews the house wars, and I didn't buy the romance. Sanderson is evolving as a writer, so he is bound to have a few missteps.    The best thing about the novel is that it is only Sanderson's second book. If he is this good now, imagine how good he will be when he hits his stride. I highly recommend Mistborn.
0752864300|5.0|Dick presents us with yet another bizarre vision of the future in this fast-paced adventure novel.  The protagonist is a bounty hunter who tracks down renegade androids who have killed their off-planet masters and fled to Earth to lose themselves among the general human populace.  Complicating his job is the inevitable fact that as technology improves, it becomes increasingly more difficult to tell the androids from real people.  So the hunter has to administer very subtle tests to his subjects in order to verify their non-humanity. These tests require the co-operation of the subject, even as the androids - knowing they are about to be detected - are preparing to kill him.<br /><br />The title is a riff on the reigning philosophy of the period, a faith called Mercerism, which advocates the sanctity of all life (spiders, chickens, goats, whatever) and provides a communal experience that validates human empathy.  Dick postulates that no matter how closely the machine mind may approximate humanity, it can never achieve empathy with the living, and so must ultimately fail.  Even if Mercerism is a sham, it is better to believe in humanity, it is better to believe that we are not alone, it is better to believe that someone will help us when we find ourselves stuck in the tomb world, than to give in to despair.  The machines, which know neither despair nor empathy, have nothing to bind them together, to take them beyond the confines of their own short existences, while humanity, which has the potential for community, can see a bigger, and ultimately more lasting picture.<br /><br />This is one of Dick's best novels: well-constructed around a strong central character, with a reasonable ending instead of the jaw-dropping \\"twist\\" that (while cool) sometimes mars his books.  Readers new to this giant of the genre might do well to start here.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Let's 'give discredit where discredit is due'.  The White Stripes are an overrated 4-chord garage band with NO originality whatsoever!  The 'youve heard them before' riffs and vocals are rehashed sonics, and have been part and parcel of rock music for decades.  The first song is OK, but what follows is one of the worst snoozefests in rock music history.  Pass on this one.  Unless of course, you're one to fall for overrated trendy bands that have been cleverly marketed to musically stunted fans who fall for anything these days!
1594489505|5.0|This book, as well as Kite Runner by the same author, have provided a lesson in the culture, history, and struggles of Afghanistan, making some of the differences between Afghan-Americans and others from that region more understandable.  In this book, two women from very different backgrounds become allies to survive in modern day Afghanistan.  They are neighbors when Kabul was peaceful and, by the descriptions provided, a beautiful place to live (if you are a man or have a husband or father who allows you some freedoms).  After the Soviet occupation is ended they, in a strange twist, are married to the same man.  The story is both personal and historical, allowing the reader to get an idea of the day to day lives of both the women in the story and the people of Kabul through the many changes in the last fifty years.<br /><br />In addition to the great story, I have applied a lot from the book to better understand the people from Afghanistan who are living in the United States today.  It is very difficult for Americans who are, like me, unfamiliar with the history of that part of the world to understand the many cultural differences, such as why some woman wear a Burqa, arranged marriages and the importance of family honor, why so many woman are afraid to break free of the family and stand up for what we think are obvious rights and freedoms, and the many difficulty in creating a lasting peace in the region.  This book provides a glimpse of understanding to each of these things and more.  Although we are free to disagree with some of those things, as I and probably many others do, it is important to understand them.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|The Good Shepherd might have been a great shepherd, if only this attractively shot film had been a good deal shorter. There's a terrific hour and forty five minutes buried somewhere in the two hours-plus here. Witness the beginning of the CIA, from its pre-WWII inception to its near-unravelling in the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco. That's a long stretch of years, and this very good motion picture makes you feel the length of every one of them.<br /><br />In spite of its crippling length, this movie has a wonderfully understated performance by Matt Damon, and lots of good cast support. If the guy Damon plays weren't such an insufferable family jerk, he might be sympathetic, even likeable, in his quiet, no-nonsense CIA role.<br /><br />It seems, if you believe that this movie is true, that our intelligence agency's problems did not begin with the current administration. Here is political and geopolitical scandal at its most bizarre, intense, and improbable. Vastly entertaining--again, if only the length of the presentation weren't so vast.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
B000RO9PXC|2.0|When he speaks to the crowd Morrison is funny and entertaining. Excited and full of fire. But.....when he sings....he's flat, slurs and forgets words, his timing is off and his enthusiasm comes and goes. At times he seems bored singing and just wants to get back to talking with the crowd. The band is NO help. They are very sloppy. Krieger is having a bad night. Densmore's timing is shakey. And the usually reliable Manzarek stumbles through out. There are some technical problems, but that's not an excuse, they're all off.     However, at times Morrison's heart is in the right place. He just can't deliver. He's bombed and just wants to talk to the crowd. They lifted the \\"Astrology\\" rap from the second show for the American Prayer album. But, very few people buy a live album because of the between songs chatter.    If you want to hear a great live Doors show, check out \\"Live in Detroit\\". Morrison is electric. He's in great voice and excited to be playing. The band is tight and powerful.    This was released for the die hard fans. The ones who buy every bootleg out there. If you're one of those you'll want to hear this. But, if you're new to the Doors, or just want to hear a consistant live show, buy \\"Detroit\\".
B00005JPFH|2.0|Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad \\"Three's company\\" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1 & 2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1 & 2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Thanks goodness DT are back! On listening to Octavarium, I was worried that they had lost the plot somewhat but SC sees them re-establish their credentials as the world's finest prog-rock band. I highly recommend getting the special edition which has the bonus DVD on the making of the album because it's chock-a-block with little bits of trivia (and clips of incredible playing) that will delight all DT fans. This is heavy rock album, probably dark even, but filled with enough light within the shade to keep everyone happy. If like me you thought Awake, Train of Thought and Six Degrees were their finest offerings, then you'll love SC.

B000063COX|4.0|THE BAND: Paul Di'Anno (vocals), Steve Harris (bass), Dave Murray (guitar), Dennis Stratton (guitar), Clive Burr (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1980) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 40 minutes. Recorded at Kingsway Studios, London. This is the band's debut album. The disc contains a 22-page booklet with a brief intro, song lyrics, numerous band pictures, and thank you's. All songs written by Harris, Di'Anno and/or Murray. The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (live performances of \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\"), the band's catalog of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '80 Europe Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by Derek Riggs. Label - Sanctuary.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Some will claim Iron Maiden's debut as a \\"masterpiece\\". While it's a good album; an important album; an essential album in the band's catalog; our introduction to mascot \\"Eddie\\"... I simply can't label it as such. It's not as professional, slick, or complex as their 2nd release (\\"Killers\\"), or any of Dickinson's 1st three albums with the band - these were masterpieces. The sound on this debut, though digitally remastered, is still pretty raw. Maybe that's the appeal here. Kind of like debuts from Kiss, Rush, Motley Crue, Def Leppard... all good starts, but I can't label them masterpieces. With each, their best albums were still ahead of them - and that applies to Iron Maiden too. For me, the sound of Iron Maiden's debut is caught somewhere between Motorhead and the Sex Pistols. The music fits here - and to my ears, Di'Anno's vocals are somewhere between Lemme Kilmister and Johnny Rotten. For the most part, the songs are quickly paced, straight ahead angry rock, with a side of punk thrown in. Di'Anno was somewhat gruff and unpolished vocally (his lack of desire and drug/alcohol issues later on would eventually make his stay with the band a short one). The album opens in great form. \\"Prowler\\" is probably my favorite track here - nice guitar opening, cool lyrics, lightning fast guitar solo, great melody. \\"Sanctuary\\" and the album closer \\"Iron Maiden\\" are great tracks and can still be heard at their concerts. \\"Running Free\\" with it's thundering drums is also a crowd favorite and the only single released back in 1980... the song reached #34 on the UK charts. Other highlights and lost gems include the tender \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and \\"Strange World\\", the simplistic instrumental \\"Transylvania\\", and the 7-minute epic \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". Keep in mind - Iron Maiden would endure several band member changes during their early years... and when singer Bruce Dickinson joined (1982), the band would never sound the same again. Maiden's debut is a nice intro to the band though a tad rough around the edges (4+ stars).track here - nice guitar opening, cool lyrics, lightning fast guitar solo, great melody. \\"Sanctuary\\" and the album closer \\"Iron Maiden\\" are great tracks and can still be heard at their concerts. \\"Running Free\\" with it's thundering drums is also a crowd favorite and the only single released back in 1980... the song reached #34 on the UK charts.

B000NA28I4|1.0|Not a single sentence in this DVD is true to the book. I don't like the casting either.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|As a Rush fan of 30 years, it's very difficult to be objective about this band. Rush was once described as a sort of pleasurable secret shared by only those who know and understand what constitutes superior, unique rock music. Rush fans, it is said, are a strange bunch - fiercely supportive of the band and anything it issues. This is perhaps understandable since Rush has always explored new musical territory and are constantly evolving. What makes them also a standout from the crowd (apart from each being very capable musicians on their chosen instruments) is that unlike many of their peers, they've stuck together all these years. To me they are a thinking man's band, intellectual but not overly so - they never lose sight of the fact that ultimately, it's all about the music. And in this case, the music is pretty darn good. Alex Lifeson's guitar tone is probably the best it's been since Fly By Night or Hemispheres (I despaired throughout the '80s and '90s at how feeble it sounded) and as one reviewer correctly said, his true calling could well be on the acoustic guitar. Geddy Lee may have lost some power vocally but he more than makes up for it in his touch and technique while Neil Peart's lyrics and playing are all you'd want them to be. All in all, a much better effort than Vapor Trails and a tad ahead of Test for Echo and Counterparts by virtue of the inclusion of a couple of brilliant instrumentals.

The first eight cuts at least just irritated me to listen to, and successive attempts haven't improved my first impression.  I dunno what it is, maybe it's just me.
B000002LSV|5.0|This is an excellent overview of ZZ Top's music.  It's got all the hits you'll remember from the radio.  This is the ultimate hillbilly rock album.  Snazzy guitars make their presence known throughout.  This disc has 18 songs and 1 hour and 12 mintues of music.  Great value.  This is a must-have for any Top fan.
0345448162|5.0|Marion Zimmer was born in Albany, NY, on June 3, 1930, and married Robert Alden Bradley in 1949. Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. Writing for over 4 decades, she is best known for her Darkover science fantasy series and her Avalon series. She also edited anthologies for 14 years and published Marion Zimmer Bradley's FANTASY Magazine.    She died in Berkeley, California on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a major heart attack.    This book is a re-telling of the Arthurian legend with the plot focusing on Morgaine or as she is often called Morgan Le Fay. The author portrays her as a woman who is fighting for her Celtic culture in a world that is slowly but surely turning towards Christianity. Britain is turning from the old beliefs and the druidic way of life and it seems that nothing can stop it . . .
0143038419|5.0|One evening, a few of us were chatting together about our lives and assorted things and a friend recommended this book.  I will admit I do not often buy the newest book out and usually stick to sci-fi, but I thought, \\"Why not?\\"  I  knew nothing about it.    I bought the last copy in my local bookstore and read it over the next three days as I had the time:  I loved it....mostly.  I loved Rome, I LOVED India, I loved everything but the ending.  Maybe it is because I could empathize with many of her feelings about her life--we're nearly the same age.  Maybe it is because I too have found a living guru and study yoga.    For those who found it selfish, well...it's a biographical story, what else would it be?  Aren't we all involved with ourselves?  I found it comforting to not be the only misplaced, wandering soul in this contemporary society of America.  Anyway, on the whole it is a great read and I found Gilbert's style fun and very personal, like she was a friend of mine who trusted me with her inner self.  Read it, enjoy it, love yourself.
B0002X314C|2.0|This is the first cd of his I bought, and I was disappointed some of the lyrics seemed more mean-spirited and harsh than I expected/they needed to be.  One of my favorite r&b (Stevie the Wonder) never utters a harsh word, but can state a negative opinion w/out offending.  Maybe it's a maturity issue, either his or mine, I'm not sure.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Do you remember how John Fogerty would take the CCR mixes out to his car and play them loud to see how they would sound?  Well you have to do that with this cd.  If you play it loud enough you'll see God. Yeah there's great guitar - but the bass is what propels it.  Talbot's bass playing is in top form and transforms the music. If the CD isn't long enough just play it again! Smell the Horse, Feel the Horse, Ride the Horse! R.I.P. Danny Whitten.
0596101996|5.0|I used to think that JavaScript was kind of a toy scripting language -- only good for doing minor web page tasks.  But after reading this book -- my 3rd JavaScript book -- I found out that JavaScript can do as much as most programming languages, except for low-level system calls, etc.  I'm starting to use JavaScript as my main programming language at home.  It's a lot more fun than C++, and it doesn't require a compiler, etc.    David Flanagan knows JavaScript inside and out; he explains everything very clearly; and he covers every detail of the language.  If you are a JavaScript programmer, this is THE book to buy.  You won't need any other ones.
0767802470|5.0|Seen from the viewpoint of a naive young German submarine crew near the end of World War 2, this is one of the best films about war. How many of today's people anywhere in the world can hold patriotism and honor so dear as to fight a nearly impossible fight to its inevitable end?<br />The film depicts life in a submarine --- from coarse humor to strict discipline, grittiness to terror and yet the humanity of each character shines through in individual displays of honor and courage.
B00008D1NF|5.0|I first heard and saw Marisa Monte on World Link TV a couple of years ago doing Agua de Marcos with David Byrne. I thought, who is this girl in sunglasses? Recently I saw Tribalistas videos of Carnavalia and Passe em Casa. Watching these people work together is pure joy. Look at the guys sunglasses! Special Guest Margareth Menezes, on Passe em Casa, has a lovely habit of singing with her arms outstretched. Watch Arnaldo Atunes playfully mock her singing style with his arms outstretched. Oops! I'm supposed be reviewing the CD. Well, their enjoyment of singing together comes through on the CD. Words in Portuguese and English, plus guitar chords! I already plan to sing Mary Cristo in church at Christmas.  I noticed how many reviewers said \\"I can't listen to anything else\\". This music makes me feel good. I'm considering buying several Tribalista CD's to give to musical friends who will appreciate this joyful sound. For the rest of you, Buy It.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I was enthralled when I first saw the preview, the idea of a serial killer killing women for their scent was fascinating - albeit this was before I found out it was based on a book. It's always interesting when a bad guy is actually the protagonist.    Tom Twyker shot this beautifully, with amazing shots and scenery, without too much pizzazz or speed which we saw in Run Lola Run, since as a life story it had to be told as a story of someone's life, which shouldn't be rushed. I was enthralled on how he captured the essence of smell in each shot, and actually made you think that each smell and each breath had a distinct feeling.    What really amazed me was when I found out that Twyker actually composed the music to this movie. He actually wrote the music and played it while they were shooting, and this really captured a specific mood and feeling for each scene - I know how hard it is to direct, but to write the music as well? Seriously.    All in all it was a great experience from front to back. Dustin Hoffman was a bad casting choice - in my opinion he sucked ever since he participated in the heretical \\"The Messenger\\", but other than that, it was a solid, great movie, shot masterfully by Twyker, of whom I am now a huge fan.    Just the fact that Kubrick deemed it unfilmable, and how Twyker made it possible, was amazing. Kubrick couldn't see it but we now can thanks to Twyker. Next stop: I'm going to read the book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My boyfriend and I are absolutely obsessed with this.  Never had a chance to watch it on TV, but I recommend owning it.  It's amazing to watch, and I love just having it playing in the background when people are over.  SIMPLY AMAZING!
0312330529|3.0|It's very Quixotic, with a sort of romantic pathos (my take). The author seems to romanticise about everything (India style) from mafia dudes and prostitutes to homeless, illiterate slum dwellers. I guess I'm a bit too sardonic and iconoclastic to buy that some scumwad mafia don is a spiritual giant to \\"his people\\" just because the author thinks so.......burp! Also, that an angry, man hating manipulative succubus from Switzerland is the most beautiful woman and has won his heart? I don't think this guy ever got laid much (my take), HA!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This contains a mixture of traditional vocals and lively jazz interpretations of songs previously made popular by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Karen Carpenter.  I was pleased when my 19 year old girl, formerly into rap, fell in love with this album.
1416523359|5.0|i have not read stephen king in many years, thought i'd outgrown him.  this book is something else, his writing, imagination, ability to articulate and build up fear.  damn the book was good.
068987474X|5.0|Really great book and quite eye-opening. Greg tells it like it is in an upbeat and honest way. I would recommend this for any woman, it's entertaining but could be life altering.
0399226907|5.0|When my children were slightly younger, we went through this book many times.  It's a great first book for an infant or toddler, and serves to get them interested in these things called \\"books\\" and shows them just how much fun books can be.  It's a classic for a reason.
B00005NB8K|3.0|...its still just a movie. and i dont feel this portrays Jim Morrison accuratly enuff or deep enuff. But it shows the side that most people percieve i think, and it isnt a bad movie, just should be watched in fun...if you really wanna know this band, get their albums, read jims poetry and maybe find a good biography book of him.<br /><br /> This movie has been critised on here for being more about Jim than about the rest of the band as a whole, but thats becouse again, its portraying the casual listeners perception of the band...they only like Jim Morrison, cuz he looks sexy and the music was cool....and those other guys just happened to be in the band....and the movie is conscious of this and theres scenes where people try to exploit Jim and tell him to lose the other guys. And even a photographer tells Jim that its all about him, that everyone just loves him, that hes the doors.<br /><br />So its not like the movie is decieved and lieing to us, its just showing the more so the MYTH that was Morrison...not the man, who is far more interesting to me than the whats shown in this film.<br /><br />This movie didnt ruin or spoil my outlook on the band or Jim Morrison.<br />Ive grown up hearing and respecting the doors and know what very well done music theyve produced besides radio hits, so my appreciation isnt clouded by this little film.<br /><br />I think its fun to watch. I dont know if i will ever watch it again, but it just makes me wanna delve into who Jim really was and into The Doors music even more, cuz i know they were far more than this mere movie, which still pays ok tribute to the band and the singer.<br /><br />This movie still doesnt quench a thirst or curb my appetite for learning more about the Doors and Morrison, its more like a little appetiser, if anything.<br /><br />I wouldnt watch this movie as if it were a documentary...it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It doesnt possiably sum up what the Doors were as a band, or who Jim was , as a man.<br /><br />Again...it has fun portraying the MYTH.... not the man, or should i say, men. Cuz all the guys in the band made this movie possiable. Jim alone, wouldnt of amounted to anything i dont think, without the other gifted musicians he was privied to have met.<br /><br /> I like how ya get to see Jim first starting out, and meeting his future girlfriend Pam and his future band mates.... its nothing all that deep, how it unfolds, but its kinda interesting.<br /><br />Its more so a movie for casual listeners of the Doors, or for fans that just wanna take a pretend look out how it might of been in the life of Jim and the other Doors members, just to see the story come to life in some way.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a decent job playing Jim i think, but he only nails that mythic \\"rock God\\" thing...i wish the movie showed more of his comtemplative thoughtfull side, but it scratches the surface i think. But for a hollywood movie, what do you expect...they still did a good job keeping it entertaining for mass appeal and creating a cool little tribute to the man and band.<br /><br />Again, this is not the best example of learning or appreciating The Doors, let alone their singer...but its kinda fun and interesting.the MYTH.... not the man, or should i say, men.

B000Q6GUTI|1.0|Danny Glover's lisp/slurring was so distracting I'd rather have been watching the Home Shopping Network.    YUCK.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|Warning: Contains major spoilers!!!    Im not a completely 100 percent practical kind of person. I love romanticism, mythology, and anything whimsical, insightful and deep. But even so, I must say...What the hell is going on here exactly???      Throughout most of the movie, I harbored feelings of sorrow and understanding for this boy, turned teen, turned man, who knew only what seemed to be pure misery in his life. He was lonely to the extreme. He was unintentionally, destructively breaking down his mentality by his way of thinking and perception. And as demented as it sounds, I even went as far as to completely understanding why he would do something like what he did. I could relate to alot of the sadness and means of wanting, and hoping for, in his life.     It was very different, and I really started liking the movie itself, and the idea of digging into the core of this misunderstood madman, yet  coldhearted jaded ruthless killer, who didnt know what love was, but wanted to be loved by a world that didn't love him.     But wait, I didnt finish.     When it started drawing near the conclusion, I was apologizing to my mom for making her rent it, and we were both quite completely lost.    Alright. Jean Baptise is sentenced to crucifixtion. Understandable. He comes out to face his death sentence, waves his little white napkin (with the scent of his perfume) around, and everyone in this city falls to their feet, calls him \\" the angel\\" and claims that he is \\"innocent\\" after killing alot of very innocent girls. The whole town has an orgy around him while he is contemplating his thoughts on a platform in the middle of them. Huh?     Wow. From there it was beginning to look like a horny college guy's dream. It wasnt even remotely realistic at all. I mean what the hell? Could you have atleast provided alternative endings, where one ending makes sense, instead of having only one that doesn't at all? A murderer is NOT going to be getting out of a scheduled crucifixation because he has invented the perfect smell. Hundreds of middle aged people are not going to have sex out in public around him because he smells good or even perfect. I cannot even fathom that. Nobody alive is that forgiving....No family of a deceased person would say, \\"Oh yeah, dont worry about our daughter. She died for a good cause. Just let me have a whiff of that concoction and we'll call it even.\\"     At the end, everything was so exaggerated.     Meanawhile, One high class father, of one of the girls Jean Baptiste kills, falls to his knees and out of the blue calls Jean his son... Because he smells good? I don't know. Mr Jean Baptiste seems to have the ability to control the world with this perfume. Does it explain further? No. Does it show said high class father anymore? No. Does it show high class father and Jean hugging in delighted glee to give audience clues to understanding if they are really father and son? No.    Wait, wait thats NOT EVEN the most nonsensical part. Nope.    Jean travels back to the place he was born while another guy gets convicted and hung for something he did not do. When Jean gets to his hometown, he  pours the perfume all over his head and gets devoured (as in eaten) in front of my eyes (I'm about 95 percent sure that it was cannibalistically) by his fellow neighbors.    Then it fades out to black and credits come on. Hmm.    Big Question mark.     Ive tried to think of ways that this whole story would come together under these circumstances, but I cant. Nothing makes sense.    It was so disappointing. Started off so good, then PLOP... we are off in a weird, demented, version of a bad and confused Alice in Wonderland, 18th century France setting, on crack.    I am personally wondering how this movie got so many good ratings. Perhaps nobody bothered to see the end.
B000KN7BOA|5.0|It seems that so many albums from the 60's were just a hit or two with a lot of filler.  Not this one!  I finally got around to ordering it, mainly because I just wanted a definitive version of \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" which my father bought as a single when I was a child.<br /><br />I was amazed at how wonderful this album is to listen to all the way through.  Sure, they sounded sort of like the Beatles (at one time I actually thought Holiday was a Beatles song) but they were brilliant.<br /><br />To me the real underrated jewel of this album is \\"I Can't See Nobody\\".  This was the B-side of \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" and is genuinely beutiful in it's own right, and I believe could have been a monster hit.  Hearing it remastered through a quality sound system was mind-boggling.<br /><br />So, my advice is to pay the money and find a place to relax and enjoy this masterpiece.  And, if your only impression of the Bee Gees is from the Disco era (ah ah stayin' alive, stayin' alive) then you are in for quite a surprise!<br /><br />Just thought I'd add that I got around to listening to the bonus disk and it was certainly worth it.  Some of the alternate takes are really great.<br /><br />It occured to me that some of this early Bee Gees sounds a lot like the progressive stuff that The Move was doing around that time.  Really interesting.
B00005JP5P|5.0|*SPOILERS*    Sunshine is a great movie.  The shots of the ship gliding through space, the effects, the acting.  Its all good.  Things begin to fall apart a bit once the crew reaches Icarus 1.  I thought Cliff Curtis's character had the potential to expand and grow but it was not so.  The addition of Pinbacker is also odd.  It changed the tone of the movie, although the ending did redeem it.      Overall Sunshine is a great movie that,while not a masterpiece, comes very close
B000683VI4|5.0|Although I'm not going to give away any spoilers ... this is a love story like no others.  I think that everyone can relate on some level to this movie.  You will fall in love with this couple & become drawn in to their story.  I recommended this to my mother who after the movie called up crying her eyes out.  Even my husband enjoyed this movie.  If your looking for a movie that will make you laugh, cry & touch your heart ... this is a must-see.
B000003NA4|5.0|All of Diana's CD's are beautiful but this holds a special place in my heart. \\"You Are Beinging To Be A Habit\\" is my song for my husband. It is even his ringtone. Her songs are awesome and her gift is special!

B00005JKZU|5.0|I am slowly but surely getting into the story, and yes, I'll eventually get through the trilogy.<br /><br />Just as in the first one, there are excellent visual effects and great acting.<br /><br />I do see many spiritual applications to this story.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to watching \\"Return of The King.\\"<br /><br />One last comment:  I loved the opening of this episode.  Also, the ending has more suspense than the ending of \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\".
076780421X|5.0|Salma Hayek & Matthew Perry are an incredible combination together. There are so many funny scenes it's hard to pick a favorite! Growing up in a \\"multi-culture\\" family myself, it's funny how people can be so different & so much alike at the same time. It's not just a chick-flick & people of different backgrounds can enjoy all the \\"spice\\" of this delicious romantic comedy that takes place in beautiful Central Mexico & Viva Las Vegas!<br /><br />Too bad that they never came out with the sound-track to this movie ... the music is just a good as the movie!

1594489505|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It shed light on a different way of life.  When I read of the plight of women in other parts of the world, it makes me really appreciate that I live in a country that does not demean women.
B000002O51|5.0|There are projects that are a good collection of good, even great songs, and Boston's debut project fits in that category.  Other projects are a step above; maybe the songs are not as strong by themselves, but the whole combination and song order makes the unit a piece of art.  Third Stage is an example of this category.<br /><br />I find it interesting that most classic rock stations treat Boston as a '70's band, playing selections from the first two projects.  The only thing from \\"Third Stage\\" that surface is \\"Amanda\\", which is a nice ballad, but to me is boring, and not a prototypical Boston song.  \\"We're Ready\\" and \\"Cool Your Engines\\" are more Boston in style, but after hearing them again, I can see why they haven't stuck like the older songs.<br /><br />This project includes my all-time favorite Boston song, \\"Can'tcha Say\\".  I hope the person who decided it didn't belong on the greatest hits collection is doing life without parole, and I would consider the death penalty in that case.<br /><br />Tom Scholz has always been my favorite guitarist, even more so than Phil Keaggy, and Kerry Livgern, which all are close.
0785123490|5.0|The Cosmic Epic to end all cosmic epics!!  Thanos trying to become god, universe spanning action, Adam Warlock leading Marvel's greatest characters... AWESOME!!!  Starlin does a great job with all of these characters, and with a brilliant strategy to save the universe.  In only 6 issues this story flows wonderfully toward it's conclusion.  This will help people who've never thought about such things to wonder about the nature of god being omnipotent, and all-knowing, and the nature of time a lil bit too.  Can't say enough about this book.  Also, don't read this before you check out Silver Surfer:Rebirth of Thanos.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|Well I bought the DVDs and they looked so bad compared to what I watched on HDTV that I broke down and bought a blu-ray player and this set on Blu-ray. By all means buy it if you like nature documentaries. I've watched some episodes twice already and was not bored. Anyway, they look great too, but there is no reason that for even more money than the DVDs they don't include the extras. The 10 minute docs after each episode are wonderful and show you what the film teams went through. Literally days of hiding out in a tent just to get a few minutes of the birds of paradise footage. Well you'll have to rent the DVDs to see it all if you buy these. Are they really 25GB discs? If so, that is even more lame and makes it more inexcusable not to use 50GB and inlcude all the extras. You could buy these and not know what you're missing on the DVDs. Unfortunately, you'll be missing a lot.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|The town of Antonio Bay is preparing to celebrate the centennial of its founding. But something sinister is afoot - something in the dense fog that has started coming inland; causing tremors, messing with electricity - and worse. Something wants revenge on the city for a wrong done long ago - can the townsfolk unravel the mystery and atone for the sin before its to late and the entire population of Antonio Bay succombs to \\"The Fog\\"?    That's the basic plot - your good old-fashioned tale of ghostly revenge. What sets this film apart is the fact that, unlike some other of his films, John Carpenter uses restraint in showing us the undead terror stalking the unsuspecting populace - indeed, the film's ghostly monsters are glimpsed only in silhouette, making them all the more terrifying.     This film does have a great cast: Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh, and others - even John Houseman, who makes a cameo at the very beginning. If the film does have a fault, it is that its breakneck pacing is too brisk: like a Greek tragedy, the story unfolds over the course of a single day, and, as such, doesn't leave much time for character development or outright suspense; when the big reveal of the crimes committed by the townsfolk comes, it doesn't have the same punch it might have had if the information had come to us in bits and pieces spaced out throughout the film. That said, The Fog is lots of fun, in the vein of Poltergeist - you may find yourself glancing over your shoulder (just in case) more than once, especially if you're watching it alone. Enjoy!

1554072840|5.0|The lovely PRUDENCE has been around for almost 30 years and is probably the #1 all-time bestselller in this category, but her classic story is fresh and magical and empowering to both you and your child! It is amazing how the writing and illustrations work together to slowly build undertsanding of and interest in potty learning.    When we saw how well the book is working, we rushed to get the DVD - [[ASIN:B0000CBLBB Once Upon a Potty For Her]] , were delighted with the new and improved plush doll + mini potty paks, and then discovered there is also an actual potty gift box! After wasting too much money on several other potties, we picked up this one - [[ASIN:B00027O0ZM Once Upon A Potty Gift Box With Song Audio Cd]] - and have never looked back. It works!

B0007OCG56|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  The trailer made it look quite good.  So, with eager anticipation, my daughter and I watched it the other night.  The premise of the story was great; a Mexican maid who speaks no English starts working for a wealthy, white family (husband, wife, daughter and son).  There were some of the usual conflicts you would expect in this situation; miscommunication, etc.  The wife, Mrs Clasky, played by Tea Leoni, was a self-obsessed control freak.  The husband, played by Adam Sandler, was a sweet and weak willed professional and successful chef.  Paz Vega played the Mexican maid, Flor.  She was the best part of the movie.  One of the major conflicts arose with Mrs Clasky taking too much of an interest in Flor's daughter and doing things with her and for her without her mother's permission.  I was quite disappointed with the orgasmic sex scene.  Mr Clasky gets some good news so he and his wife decide to \\"celebrate\\".  I don't have a problem with that, and I will grant that the scene effectively showed Mrs Clasky's self interest.  Mrs Clasky wore her sport bra (great abs Tea) and Mr Clasky was covered in the right places with a blanket.  But they went bouncing around \\"forever\\" and Mrs Clasky screamed and grunted herself into exhaustion.  This movie is rated PG-13, not R.  It should have been R.  I had to finally mute it because the scene went on and on.  If not for that sex scene, I would say the movie was okay and would be fun to watch once in a great while.  But because of the sex, I'm trashing it.  I wouldn't want to lend it to someone expecting a relatively clean PG-13 movie.  On a positive note, Mr Clasky and Flor come close to committing adultery, but don't.
1567315682|5.0|What makes them different, you ask? The answers are in this classic book on wealth building.<br /><br />Now, this is not a book about \\"trust-fund babies\\", or high-income professionals. It's a book about average Americans, and how they build and keep their wealth. (More importantly, it's about how any of us can do the same thing.)<br /><br />The advice here is timeless, and while some reviewers have said the information given isn't very valuable because \\"everyone knows how to save money\\", I have to disagree. Sure, people MAY know how to save money in their daily lives, but do they DO IT?<br />The value in this book, I think, is that is makes one take a close look at spending habits, while giving the encouraging news that if you just take care of the pennies, the dollars will take care of themselves.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to get this CD.  While some songs may seem similar all have a rawness that is great to hear.
