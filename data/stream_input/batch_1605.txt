B005603236|4.0|This most recent adaptation of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is an improvement over the rather cheesy [though still entertaining] 1986 adaptation, and is well-cast. It is rather hard to review the movie adaptations of Austen's works as too much is lost when the novel is chopped down to fit into a specific time limit, in this case about 90 minutes. Nevertheless, director Jon Jones has done an admirable job of staying true to the essence of Austen's work without losing too much of its original flavor in cutting out parts of the novel.<br /><br />The casting is well-done - J.J. Feild is consummate as the 'almost handsome' Henry Tilney [though I personally found him to be quite a dish myself]. Felicity Jones plays the role of Catherine Morland to perfection -equal parts naive yet able to see through artifice in people. Carey Mulligan as the flirty Isabella Thorpe shows much promise and is very convincing in her role. Liam Cunningham as the mercenary General Tilney makes a compellingly brooding and villainous character. The other roles are suitably cast as well.<br /><br />There is much to commend about this adaptation besides the casting - the musical score captures the gothic feel of the novel, especially in the fantasy sequences, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The scenes of Northanger Abbey especially truly evoke a romantic and mysterious feel, and credit surely must go to the able camerawork & direction. Considering that Jane Austen was very descriptive about Northanger Abbey in her novel, the particular attention that is paid in 'showing' the viewer the interior and exterior of the building is very much appreciated.<br /><br />Purists will have problems with the liberties taken with the novel, and I do personally feel that this production was unnecessarily sexed-up, but on the whole I do think that this is a much improved adaptation than the 1986 version, and also well-made and acted. I would highly recommend it to all Austen fans and those who love period dramas.mas.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun and addicting, but quick to beat.  Overall a fun game.  I've played through it twice, and will probably play through it again to win more pointless prizes.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Great movie! The mastery of digital processing has really enhanced this flick. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone for their collection!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have not opened up a book to read in a long time. I was in a local bookstore and this had captured my eye, i was reading the back side and saw, \\"Marley & me lovers, Rejoice!\\" I downloaded this to my kindle, and couldnt put it down. Amazing heartfelt book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very good. I would recommend it. I have it on my kindle and it works great. Download it.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|The Field of Dreams DVD arrived very quickly and the cost was reasonable. What's amazing is that the actual Field of Dreams site where they filmed the movie in Iowa is still pretty much the same as it was in the movie. It's a must see.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Mr. Sparks has exceeded himself.  I have been a reader of his works for several years and love this book.  There is an air of mystery that I have not seen in his other works.  As with his other books, the read just flows, and even though it is a love story,  the end is not apparent until 'the end'.  Thumbs up!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is truely amazing, attention grabbing and hard to put down!  Not for the faint of heart but will open your eyes to a whole world that most of us never knew existed.
B008602KQI|5.0|this is a great movie. entertaining, emotionally draining, a good time. love the special features. i just wish there were subtitles available for all the features. i am hard of hearing and it it difficult to understand what people are saying. especially the mumblers.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I can't imagine what they spent on this one night, but it must have been a fortune.  The production value was second to none, including the Las Vegas theather built specifically for a (albiet shortened) production of Phantom.  All characters except the Phantom himself were 10/10, gave him an 8/10, great actor, voice a tad weaker than expected.  The direction was the best I have ever seen of this show.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger games is a great movie you can almost feel the anxiety fear and pain of the main character Katniss. You feel a sense of pride and she does what her heart tells her not realizing she is starting a fire of rebellion. Excellent movie can watch it again and again
B008IEFP1E|3.0|Good Music.  Love the lyrics but the cursing takes away from it. Defintely not for kids.  Should offer the same type album but without the explicid lyrics.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|I love this show, it just keeps getting better and better.  I watched this on my Kindle Fire and it was great
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this is a great continuation of the first book - can't wait to read the last book!! So far I'm really enjoying the series.  It's been a lot different than I expected when I first started reading.  The story is so intriguing!
B007SGM084|1.0|Boring and redundant. It's a slow going book, no surprises any where. The first erotic scenes are OK but they do tend to repeat them selves
B0042TPB6S|5.0|Fantastic, great cast, well written, great character development, excellent cinematography, great costumes, funny, dramatic, everything you can want. And no violence, imagine!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Edge of your seat excitement to the end!!  It was an interesting read from the two main characters' perspectives.  I could not put this book down for one minute!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app! Only wish it was easier/possible to make edits to pins and boards and that I could pin from the web while using my Kindle. It has a hiccup now and again on start up but usually jusr requires a close and reopen to get past it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The sort of fanciful, sci-fi stuff that I didn't think i'd like.  Couldn't put town my kindle with Books 1, 2 and 3.  Couldn't wait to see the movie (although not nearly as descriptive as the book), but can't wait to see the next movie in the series.  The story line is okay, the description magnificent, the by products amazing - empathy, compassion, the selfishness of the US economy (sic people), and the ultimate goodness in mankind.  Do read the series.
B0089QLWXG|5.0|Every song is amazing.  Dont really care for Beauty and the Beat but it will get a lot of radio play thanks to Nicki Minaj.  Other than that one song I love every other song.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is just as my title says...interesting...but I enjoyed reading it and decided to read the next book. The only thing I didn't like was the phrases were repeated too often
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Have bought and read all 3 of the Hunger Games Books. Well worth the money, and really enjoyed all the books.
B004GGM444|5.0|This is essentially the best dupstep out there in my opinion. There are a few other guys I like for dubstep but, Skrillex (specifically this album) is the best from beginning to end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started this book, I could not wait to get to the next chapter fast enough. This book takes you on a roller coaster ride of highs and lows as it twists and turns and you hold on for dear life. You find yourself feeling for the husband then the wife as you learn more about them. I can see why this book is still on the best seller list.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was extremely entertaining and I loved the the characters you loved to hate.  I'm not one for a cliffhanger ending, so I didn't really enjoy the way this book ended.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Although there were a few times the book became repetitious/slow, it was a very worthwhile read. Harold's determination with his path forward was unwavering. He impacted and was impacted by so many people along the way, I had to continue to read on....and I was not disappointed!
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book!  As a teacher I chose to read it with my 7th & 8th grade literature class.  Best decision ever!  They LOVED it!  Even the boys.  It's very difficult to find a book that appeals to a whole class of middle schoolers, but this was the book!
B001F5M9MG|5.0|What can I say? If you are a ZZ top fan this cd is one of the best . I rate this cd  a+++++
B004RGEOXM|3.0|If you dig Ashcroft's voice, and songwriting style you will enjoy this. Nothing groundbreaking here though in my humble opinion though.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Like the title says it is the ultimate songs of Seger.A must have cd for you Seger fans to own.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this app works great on my Kindle Fire!  Pinterest has something for everyone.  I highly recommend this app.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Fabulous book. Couldn't put it down. This is a great trilogy!! Great characters. Can't say enough about these books and author. You must read this trilogy!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie but of course the book has much more detail.  My wife kept pointing out the differences from book and movie.  If you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy the movie a little bit better.  Movies never contain the details but they did a great job on the movie.
034580404X|5.0|The books were great, I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd book more than the first, but you have to read the first book to know what's going on!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I bought this dvd for my wife because she wanted a short, effective workout. Right at the bat, Jillian set the bar high at level 1. It's a continuous cardio, strengthen and abs workout for 20 minutes with 5 minutes of warmup and cool down. My wife saw results within a week. She gave the dvd to her mother so now she's workout on Amazon instant video that came with the dvd purchase. I know this workout works because my sister-in-law shed 10 pounds within 1.5 month and she looks great! Good luck on your workout!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Was watching Stars earn Stripes and learned about Chris Kyle.  One of the best books I have read in a long time. He was a dedicated Seal and Sniper.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Strong story, great characters!! Action, comedy and drama, it has it all. A movie my whole family loves!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|excellent. Have been watching in bits and pieces so it has been good to start at the beginning and see it all
B001NHNG64|5.0|This novel is a well written, gripping story but at times very gruesome in detail.  I am on my third in the series and still find the story telling ingrossing.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Love the music!  Just what my wife wanted.  Crystal clear, fast download, and can't beat the price.  I could have purchased each song for .99, but to get all of his hits for 99 cents was fantastic.  I'm keeping my eyes out for other deals like this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Love the books, loved the movie. Can't wait until Catching Fire comes out... Highly suggest this movie and hope it will make you want to read the books.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good! Relating to the trials of the characters in the novel makes one keenly more aware of how power can be misused.
B006LSZECO|1.0|didn't like this at all.  not enough to it  it took forever to get to the story.<br />no good at all.
B008602KQI|5.0|We all loved the movie. Almost like the book. Can't wait tell the other two books are made into movies.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My husband, 18-yr-old son and I all love this movie!  We have watched it several times- at the theater then on Directv a few times.  Just last week I decided to buy it for my husband on blu-ray because he wanted to watch it again! \\"Despicable Me\\" has such a great story with heart, really good, lovable characters, and adorable  little minions that will grow on you quickly.  The minions may all look identical at first glance, but they have their own personalities and look.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A lot like the first book, it seems they only do one thing and its all about sex most of the time. It gets boring after a while. We wait to see if they will do something new but they dont.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|This movie is a classic, even though it's not as good as 1 or 2, but it's definitely worth watching.
B008602KQI|3.0|As a real fan of the books(I've read all three), I was eagerly looking forward to the release of this film. However, the whole look and feel of the movie lacks the depth and richness of the books. The so-called romance between Katniss and Peeta lacks any real fire.
B0081ELJ7U|5.0|The culmination of four years of waiting for Castle and Beckett to finally get together. Both stars killed it with their performances. Castle's speech in Kate's loft was so well done and had my heart in my throat. The end was perfect. Can't wait for S5.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great read.  SK has outdone himself with this masterfully crafted novel.  It's a great premise, and a clever adaptation of a terrible time in our history.  If you don't read his books because they're too scary, read this one.  Not scary, just really clever.
B008CP93S0|1.0|Remember when you first saw the preview for the movie and you thought, \\"this is going to be hilarious!\\"  Well, you were wrong...and don't feel bad, so was I.  Thankfully, I had a coupon for this movie and it didn't cost me a penny.  Don't waist your time...it really sucked.  It wasn't funny, and it was predictible.  If you are looking for an excuse to waist two hours and not get them back..this is the movie for you.  And shame on you Jennifer Aniston...I thought you had better taste then to do a movie like this.  I guess the $$ was too good to pass up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very interesting! The story was great and it was easy to follow. Kept you intrigued through to the end and kept you guessing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love, love, love this series. It's the second in the Quell mobile games series. The puzzles are intriguing and can be solved fairly easily within the allowed number of moves. Instructions are clear, and the background music is very relaxing. It's a great way to pass time on the bus, while waiting in an office, or if you're having difficulty sleeping.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|The Windup Girl is a quick reading book that takes you into a future Thailand where food and resources are scarce. The author does a good job of taking you through the eyes of different characters experiencing the over arcing story line. My biggest knock on the book would be that it feels like it's missing a main character, you're never quite sure who you should be rooting for and I believe the author wanted it that way. This is one of those books where the story stays with you well after you finished reading it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of those books you can't put down. You can't wait to see whats going to happen next. I can't wait to see if they make a movie out of it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have fallen in love with Christian and Anastasia and will be lost when I finish the 3rd book!  Thank you E.L. James for putting your midlife crisis fantasies in print, I hope there will be more!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the trilogy, I think I am going to read it again. Yes it is that good. It will be hard for another book to compare to this one.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|A great read with ideas that crack open your cranium and mix up the gray matter. Now when you look back at how things were produced [before these ideas] it will be with a sense of bewilderment.
B008EQIK90|3.0|Pure mindless entertainment with enough plot to carry it through.  Won't make my top ever list of movies but it was ok to watch once and get a few chuckles out of.
B0049J3QF4|1.0|I rented this for my son cause I accidently deleted cars from our DVR and I figured thr would buy me some time to get to the store to buy it on DVD. My child watches this on a loop 24/7 and has a melt down when he can't. So it sucked majorly when after watching it one time it said he had no more time to watch it. When I rented it it said 48 hour rental so I assumed that ment we could watch however many time he wants in 48 hours. I guess that's not the case.
B006470HQ0|5.0|Never ever been into this genre,but this show is an exception it has great actors and visuals that really gives the feeling of what it might be like if such a thing ever happened very good show and look forward to season 3 lets hope the directors keep it good and do not ruin it later on in the show like Lost.Lost started great and was awesome for awhile,but then it took a direction that in the end made it not so good:P
B007IXWL2C|5.0|GREAT READ!! LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE!!!!  I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A BOOK 4 FROM FIFTY'S PERSPECTIVE!!!!!!!!!!! ALSO, I'D LIKE MORE ON FIFTY AND ANNA RAISING THEIR CHILD AND BREAK THROUGHS HE HAS WITH THE DOCTOR AND COMING TO TERMS WITH HIS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER.<br /><br />ALL THREE BOOKS WERE GREAT.  BOOK 2 WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was great but waiting for it to come was not.  It took longer then a week to get here after the release date and had I known that, I would not have pre ordered it and gone out and gotten it the day it was released in the store.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|A beautifully told story with incredible visual descriptions. This is a book that will leave you with strong feelings towards/for the characters.  The author provides exceptional character development and setting.  On a side note, I enjoyed the film version with Keira Knightley.  They did the book justice.  Of course, Read the Book First!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a great story with a wonderfully chilling setting and great characters. I would say it is also rather unique in it's own way.
B000EXZI14|5.0|This is by far my favorite BeeGee's CD.  This live rendition of many of their classics is wonderful.  Great energy in their performance.  What's not to like?  Crank up the stereo and sing along to your favorites!  The same concert is available on DVD.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey book two was just awful. the writing is hideous and the story goes nowhere. The first one wasn't great but for trash reading it at least kept me engaged. But book two of Fifty Shades of Grey, just moronic......certainly won't be buying the next one since I stopped reading this one.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book. Hiking the trail has been a dream of mine for years. It may be the push I need to at least hike a section of it. This is a can't put it down book. By all means get this book and love it. I give it a 10.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|[[ASIN:0316223239 Room: A Novel]]<br />I found that this book made me think about how I would have handled a situation where a child was born and raised in one room. In the book people were critical of the mother. But did she in fact do a great job of keeping her child happy and mentally healthy? Given her situation!! And who faired the best, the mother or the child?
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I found this movie to be boring.  Actors seemed to be walking thru the movie without expressing much emotion. The costumes were nice which was about the best thing with this movie.  The movie did not follow the book.  I am glad that I chose to rent this movie rather than purchase.
B000LBB4IA|4.0|We loved this movie when it first came out even before we had kids.  Now our children enjoy it as much as we do.  Great voice talent and action throughout!
B0061S073A|2.0|The product does not run Kindle book reader itself which makes it useless for book readers. Other than that, if you just want your child to play games and not touch other stuff, it's a god application to use.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was completely surprised by this book. I went into it as a \\"cheap knock off\\" of 50 shades but I was in serious need of a \\"fix\\" after reading the 50 shades trilogy, and this book was recommended by a friend.  A few minutes into reading I found out I was seriously MISTAKEN.  I thought the writing  was great, as well as the characters.  Fell in love with Gideon right away, for completely different reasons that Christian, same goes for Eva.  Don't get me wrong, there are some obvious similiarites in the story lines, but this is a great read.  Finished in 2 days and immediately pre ordered the next book.  Until then, I am anxiously awaiting October!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Don't know what all the fuss is about, poorly written.  I have the audio version and the sound of her voice goes right through me
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Having not been a Stephen King fan, I was a little skeptical; however, this book is wonderfully written. It feels as though I am sitting across from the writer and he is just telling a story over a cup of coffee. As a baby boomer, much of the story has taken me back to the innocent times before JFK's death and puts a smile on my face on almost every page. King has obviously done his research and brings those times to life. Highly recommended!
B005MW95JI|5.0|I love this show! My wife loves this show.  Sons Of Anarchy gives an inside idea of life in the bike gang. Life devoted to the club and all for the club not any one person.  The willingness to do whatever it takes to back up the club for the clubs sake.
1892005034|5.0|I got e-mail from Amazon containing the following question:<br /><br />\\"did '[[ASIN:1892005034 Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life]] meet your expectations?\\"<br /><br />The answer is a firm loud Yes!<br /><br />Besides the contents - which is, evidently, something of a very high value in many respects and for many reasons - I found the style and use of the written language in this book to be very pleasing, acessible, fluid.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I'm going to re-read it; firstly because<br /><br />1) it takes time and repetition for someone (anyone) to actually become fluent in this new language - the language of CNV, which is a language within our own motter tongue, and it is a way of thinking and a connection with one's own emotions and so much more<br /><br />2) because it's so well written, it's a joy to read, no big effort at all.<br /><br />I'd love to have access to an audio version of this book.<br /><br />all the best<br /><br />a.<br /><br />p.s. this delivery has beatten all speed records - less than 1 week from US to Brazil with regular USPS. thanks Amazon and keep up the good work!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't understand what all this hype was about these books, so me being curious, I bought them. I couldn't put them down until I read them all. Hope there will be many more to come.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Don't let the critics or the lousy ad campaign scare you away.  Let your inner child loose on this wonderful old fashioned adventure film.  I've not enjoyed a film of this type this much since I was a kid watching Ray Harryhausen's special effects masterpieces (7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, etc.). It's a lovingly crafted adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" -- faithful in spirit if not letter.<br /><br />I think the more cynical viewers out there have trouble with the film's sincerity -- but for me it was a welcome breath of fresh air.  I've seen the movie multiple times in the theater, and the Blu-ray disc has already been watched a half dozen times.  Love it.  Want the sequels. Critics and cynics be damned.
B0089WCKG8|1.0|Whilst the concept is intriguing, the hand of the author kept intruding into the storyline totally ruining the illusion of being immersed into another world.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have found these books to be very well written. This could very well be a true and not fiction.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These guys are REAL LIFE ACTION HEROES!!<br /><br />A great book, well written and informative. Some folks have critiqued this courageous man for writing this book. They speak of an oath of science. Politicians in D.C. Have leaked a boat load of information about this operation. All this hero I'd was set the record straight.<br /><br />If you are looking to read this book because you think it will trash Obama, save your money. This book seems to be non-political. These men and women are heroes and should be treated as such. God bless the Seals and all the people who keep us safe.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. When I started reading it, I thought it would be predictable but it was not at all. I was not thrilled with the ending though. All in all, I would recommend this book.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|No matter your station in life, this quick-but-poignant read should be considered required reading for all.  I make a point of re-reading it almost weekly, and have bought copies for my grandkids to do the same.  Regardless of your particular belief system, the message is generic, pure, and enlightening.  Great job as usual, Dr. C!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Really enjoyed Drums. The action and drama is not over played and you continuously feel like your moving forward in the adventure. I'm in love with this whole series!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting concept.  I agree with the wheat/carb adding belly inches.  Not hard to follow if you have the mind set to do and know what you are doing is for your well being!  Enjoy!  Good recipes also.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|The novel was not repetive, but it was too silly!! College is somewhat similar to what she has written, but those names drove me crazy!!! The Vegas angle and Travis's family would have been a better backdrop to the novel.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Exciting in parts.  Rather too much sailing detail especially when Jim sailed the Hispaniola by himself (highly unlikely).  No information on what happened to Jum when he got home with his ill gotten gains!!  Pirates and Jim's crew were after the treasure for themselves and they killed to get there first.  There seems to be a moral question there!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this one much more than Book 1.  I am looking forward to Book 3.It is<br />not the kind of book I usually read.  But I must say I enjoyed it. We have to change our reading habits once in a while
B005ZMUQCK|4.0|My children love this movie and it is so nice to have a digital copy of it so they can watch it anywhere! The only complaint is that sometimes it stops right in the middle and then we have to restart it and fast forward to where we were. This might be a problem with the Bluray player that we are playing it on, but it seems to only be a problem with the amazon movies that we watch. It doesn't happen that frequently, and it hasn't happened when we watch it on a computer so I am thinking it might be a problem with the bluray playing amazon. not sure. But I will continue to buy my kids movies on amazon because it is so convenient, and again it doesn't happen that often.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|It is quite clear that these books are written to appeal to the fantasies of women - not just sexual. Shopping, travel, adventure and the ideal partner.  Just shamefully obvious and yet I could still not put the book down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I just could not put it down. As soon as I finished this book I ordered the next two books.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|It is quite clear that these books are written to appeal to the fantasies of women - not just sexual. Shopping, travel, adventure and the ideal partner.  Just shamefully obvious and yet I could still not put the book down.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|This show is funny for the most part and well worth watching I personally have watched all the episodes multiple multiple times. They still are able to get me to laugh. This show is well worth the 24.00 to purchase :).
B00846REIS|4.0|so far its a great series and I dont see why people are complaining about it being like Fifty...I cant wait for the next one next month!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series!!!!! Just wish they were longer. I read all 3 books in 3 days!!!!  I recommended this series to my daughter who is now caught up in a masterfully created world of literature.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|This is a fast-paced, thrilling movie with just a much plot as action. Great acting, too - I definitely recommend it.
B001OB7R7S|5.0|\\"The Nightfly\\" is a one of a kind musical experience. It's at once playful and well thought out precision. It came out when jazz made a brief come back on the radio through \\"The Manhattan Transfer\\" and \\"Rickie Lee Jones\\". If you haven't heard \\"Maxine\\" by Donald Fagen, then there is still a piece of music missing from your music listening repertoire. Get this album, it is awesome.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I did NOT want to watch this series that I absolutely love on my computer. I wanted to buy the series as a DVD but fell misguided in the way I was led to purchase the computer version. Isn't there a way to help customers figure this out?
B00633W614|5.0|I bought this on a whim because it's not a book I would normally read.  However, it was excellent.  I enjoyed how the author gave insight and perspective into each character. Often books do not provide a snapshot into each character's life outside the main story line.  I was disappointed when I finished it because I wanted the story to continue.  I can't wait until the next book is released.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book kept me on the edge of my seat wanting and waiting to find out more.  I ended up finishing the whole series in 5 days!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it,its a little glitchy but I still love it.Makes it so easy to keep track of all those projects I want to do.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day, Mark Owen<br />The author seems sincere in his effort to describe the Seal experience. One thing comes through very clearly; the arduous training and dedication of the Seals is of the highest order. The book reads like a novel. In its honesty, it is totally refreshing. Being a whistleblower is not easy and I can't help but wonder who gave away his identity. The book was originally attributed to Mark Owen, an assumed name. His real name is Matt Bissonnette<br />The Pentagon and some military spokespeople have portrayed him as a traitor to his oath. For me, the only thing this young man seems to be guilty of is fighting patriotically and bravely for his country. He should be hailed as a hero, nothing more and nothing less. Anyone who feels differently should try walking in his shoes.<br />If his only crime was that he didn't vet the book properly, I don't blame him. There is no way this President or anyone in this administration, would have let this truth be exposed, but the American people do deserve, and also have the right, to know what really went down in Pakistan when Bin Laden was captured.<br />The book is about more than the Bin Laden capture. It is this man's story, beginning with his childhood and how his life in Alaska, hunting and fishing alongside his dad, laid the groundwork for his ability to be a Navy Seal. It is about his dream, nurtured in high school, to become one. With his dad, he learned how to survive even under dreadful conditions of cold and exhaustion, so he was mentally ready for the Seals, and he went through the rigorous training, succeeding and eventually becoming part of Seal Team Six.<br />The main thrust of the book concerns the time period he was with the Seals, from 1998-2012. He describes the way the rules of engagement changed as the years passed, often preventing them from doing a proper job, and how the decision making process ground to a halt at times, moving too slowly. Some men felt that risking their lives undersuch conditions was becoming too risky. They had to warn their enemy before they approached, provide photographic evidence of their militancy and if captured, the emphasis was often on whether the enemy had been abused rather than his militaristic activity.<br />I am not sure why there is such brouhaha about the information in the book. Yes, Bin laden was shot in cold blood, without even a loaded weapon in his room; contrary to the story told by the White House, but the Seals had been fired upon, entering his compound, even if the shots were not fired by Bin Laden. Yes, they dragged his body down the steps, disrespectfully, when we were told he was treated with respect, but then, this man was responsible for the death of thousands of Americans so is anyone really surprised?<br />Paraphrasing, the main objection this Seal voiced, which was a sentiment shared by other Seals, as well, was that the President had a need and/or tendency to take credit for everything to advance himself politically. Even before they captured Osama Bin Laden, they joked about Obama taking credit for it. Still, they said, their mission was what was important, not his speeches or grandstanding.<br />I think the book had a bit too much detail, but still, I found I could not put it down. I thought it was interesting reading about the training, preparation and deployments. I respect what these men sacrifice to guarantee my security, and I applaud their efforts. On the other hand, my husband found it a bit tedious reading about all the preparations for the missions, so reader beware.<br />You may ask if it was necessary to treat Bin Laden's body like a car seat or was it necessary to throw him onto the tarmac \\"like a dead fish\\".  I just don't know if he deserved better. Making friends with our enemies has not served us that well, so far. If Washington compromised the safety of the Seals with their leaks of information and pictures, just for political capital, then I think this Seal was within hisrights, to write this story.<br />Mr. Bissonnette states that he is donating the majority of the profits from the book, to veterans' or wounded warrior charities. I donated, have you?
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is almost as good as the book.  I say, read the book first then watch the movie.  The whole series is worth reading.  I do hope they make the last two books into movies as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this one also, I think I might have even liked it better than the first one! I can't wait to read the third one!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is one of the best remote control products I've tried. Rarely has it failed to give me access to my PC whether it be from another PC or from my mobile device. It works like a charm
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! I Couldn't put it down! I would definitely suggest this book to people, which I already have been doing!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard so much about this book but found it to be lacking.  The ending was particularly strange as was a large part of the book.  Amy seemed to have not been held accountable for any of the ill deeeds that she had done.  She committed a murder.  I think that the author left the book open to a sequel.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I want to start off by saying that I loved the Maze Runner Trilogy. The first two books were excellent and the third book was good. I had high expectations for this prequel based on the trilogy.<br /><br />The following are my issues with the book:<br /><br />1. The main character, Mark, is annoying during most of the book. It reminds me of the Twilight books where you want to know what happens but that Bella girl is just so annoying.<br /><br />2. There really isn't much that goes on in the book.<br /><br />3. I personally did not feel like this really added much to the trilogy.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book but it just missed the mark.
B007SGM084|3.0|The book is good but not to happy about the bundle to hard to find place, do to the 3 books in one if I buy more trilogies I will consider only buying one book at a time.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|I have like 8 favorite authors and i finished reading all their books, so i started looking for a new one. I have to say i found my next favorite author!!!<br />She´s amazing, you really can´t guess what comes next!.<br />I enjoyed it very much and have since finished her other 2 books!!  NOw i have to look for another good author.
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw this opening day after having finished all 3 books. Loved the movie very much. I think they did a brilliant job capturing the novel on screen. Bought the dvd, first one after buying my new big flat screen. My BFF hadn't seen it yet..she LOVED the film(never read the books). How do I know this film was good, just like I know when a book is really written well..makes me laugh and cry. Even though I read the book, and had seen the film twice, losing Rue was heartbreaking...that scene will ALWAYS make me cry. Such a great film!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book started out slow for me but as I kept reading it got better & better. Can't wait to start reading the 3rd & final book.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|My husband and I watched this for the second time with out 17y/o son, and we all agreed that it was just as fun the second time around.  We have been quoting dialogue for days. I am a big fan of Shaun of the Dead, but I honestly think that this is even better. I would describe it as a dark comedy that by turns is clever and silly and sly and slapstick.  It's sweet and salty and chock full of nuts:D<br />There is some tongue in cheek naughtiness to the dialogue so I would only consider it a 'family movie' if your kids are a little older.  And while there is technically a lot of violence, it is mostly of the over the top comedic variety.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|The CPU works as it should, is fast enough for the SFF HTPC it was built into.  No problems, stock cooler is sufficient for low end use.
B007SGM084|4.0|If you can look past the subpar writing, there's an interesting story line. You have to read all three though, the climax (no pun intended) of the third book is the best part of the whole thing!
B007SGM084|1.0|Inspite of many woman loving this book, it is in my opinion, a typical story about a beautiful, rich young guy who falls in love with a poor hot virgin woman. Like many romance novels, the percent of young millionaires who qualify as beautiful and rich are vastly outnumbered by the young virginal women hoping to meet them. Add being good in bed every time to the mix and you truly have an unattainable standard that any woman who is dissatisfied with their life would love more than the bible.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I saw a friend in a local store, we discussed book clubs selections. She was reading, DJ. I went home and bought this book immediately, read it in one day. You will not be disappointed. The ending a hard decission, but placed myself in the situation and I wld have done the same thing.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I thought the story line was great. The sex was so much after a while that was boring.... The writing could of been better.
B0061S073A|5.0|this is a great way to keep little fingers away from expensive buttons. I have no problem letting my 6 year old tote the kindle around so long as kids place is turned on... until he figures out my password that is.

B005SMUW8U|5.0|Prior to purchasing this album, the only Waits album I had was \\"Real Gone\\", which I love. So I'm not a Waits fanatic, I think he's great, I just never went crazy getting his stuff. I bought this on a whim after seeing a video for \\"Hell Broke Luce\\" and I have derived nothing but enjoyment from it. Every track grabs me in one way or another. Whether he's channeling some weird Screamin Jay Hawkins/Howlin' Wolf performance, or working his vivid imagery through a ballad, it's great.<br />My favorite kind of music is something that can incorporate all kinds of emotion, and this is no exception.It's fun, humorous,sad, and angry. And like I said, I'm no Waits expert, but I think this is a badass album
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Simple, formulaic, and very shallow.  The hero's journey stripped down to it's barest elements but lacks interesting characters, compelling plot and therefore, no satisfying ending either.
B008602KQI|5.0|My 24-year-old daughter told me I should watch the Hunger Games; she said it was refreshing to see a female portrayed in a strong lead (something that wasn't always there when she was in school as a youngster).  She also told me to read the Hunger Games series.  I've now done both and wow! what a tremendous story!  It was easy to relate the framework of the story to our political system, if one wanted to step outside the simple pleasure of watching a good movie and reading enjoyable books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great Andreas read. I was kept on my toes the whole time. I thought it was even better than the first book fifty shades of grey.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I love this book. It is very easy to read and has some good and clear advices.<br />The authors has an strong position and you can notice that in the first chapters (or recipes?), and I like the way they envision and create business.
B00498TQV8|5.0|If you missed this treasure when it was released, see it now.  A heartbreaking story unfolds in a threatening and impoverished world where good does not always triumph over violence, but the struggle reveals humanity's deep capacity for kindness, sacrifice, and redemption.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63, was a thoroughly enjoyable tale, by a modern master. I have read more of Stepeh King's older stuff, but have not ventured into to many of his more recent works. As I'm not a horror fan, this book was a pleasant surprise, as it didn't go into that area of writing at all. The story and writing, overall, were nothing short of fantastic. I highly recommend this to any, and all, readers, as it has something in it for everyone.<br />Mike Ritchie
B00338QENI|5.0|I had never thought about how all the cell research was done and this gave me a better idea of all the work the researchers do to try to find new solutions for our determination to live healthier lives. Very good book and I am glad I can order these books through Amazon, it is so easy.

B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Stephen King may be famous for the horror novel, but his memoir on the craft, On Writing, is really my favorite book of his. This book is not only amazingly helpful, it is funny, engaging, and pragmatic. With great directness and honesty, King recounts his life growing up, citing along the way all the things that shaped him into the writer he now is. He's had a hard life, hails from the same  delightful working middle-class, and is unapologetic for his roots and his swear words. @#$$%%# go Stephen! Your book helped me a ton. Where most books on writing are dry, long-winded, and full of the rules, On Writing is witty, conversational, and direct about when and how to break them, and when you really, really shouldn't. He doesn't mess around.
B00846REIS|3.0|Seemed like it ran on a little . The ending was a bore. It seemed like there was a lot of info that could have been shared that wasn't . That was annoying.

159562015X|2.0|Sir Ken Robinson tells a story in his famous TED talk on education about a world-renowned choreographer who as a child saw a specialist to check her for a learning disability.  After talking with her mother the specialist told the girl he had to talk to her mother alone. As they left his office he turned on the radio.  Outside they watched as the girl began to move and sway with the music.  The specialist turned to the girl's mother and told her she wasn't sick, she was a dancer.<br /><br />Too often we try to fix the things that we think are \\"wrong\\" with us.  Tom Rath in StrengthsFinder 2.0 argues that we would be better served by focusing our attention on what is \\"right\\" with us.  To that end he offers the Clifton StrengthsFinder program.  Using a code found in the book readers are able to go online and answer a quick 30 minute array of questions and instantly get feedback on their top 5 strengths.<br /><br />Anyone who read and used Now, Discover Your Strengths will be familiar with the process as the only real difference between the two books is a more robust online site that offers an action planning guide and a more personalized strength guide to help you in putting your strengths to work.<br /><br />For those familiar with John Maxwell's argument that it's better to take a skill from 7 to 9 and become world-class than work on a skill from 4 to 6 and still be mediocre this argument will sound very familiar.<br /><br />The book has only 31 pages of text while the rest consists of the 34 Themes and ideas for action.  Much like a movie sequel that offers the same actors and story as the first, this book has more bells and whistles than the first, but enough to justify a $24.95 price tag is questionable.<br /><br />While I agree that it is imperative that we know our strengths and work to maximize them daily, this book seems more about generating another income stream for the author and the Gallup organization when you realize that Now, Discover Your Strengths covered the same territory over 10 years ago.  Much like my review of How Full is Your Bucket?, I would argue that while the information is valuable it has already been covered more effectively in the past.  And in the case of this book by the same publisher over a decade ago.<br /><br />One last point that supports my contention: this is one of the few books I've ever seen that advertises the author's other book on the back cover.  In this case Tom Rath's book Well Being (published by Gallup Press).  If you notice most books the copy on the back cover will either discuss the book itself or have recommendations from other authors or well-known persons.<br /><br />While I recommend what the book is trying to do, if you have used Now, Discover Your Strengths (and millions have) I would suggest you dig around for those results and work off of those and save $25.ered the same territory over 10 years ago.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not sure why so many people wrote bad reviews on this series but I think this has been the best love story I have read and will probably ever read. I feed sorry for anyone who was so focused on any one detail they did not like that they missed out on the story. Yes it was descriptive, and yes it was detailed but that is exactly what I loved about it. If you are not a hearts and flowers kinda person then don't read the book. I you don't believe in love then don't read the book. I can't wait for another series or anything from this author. And to all of the haters, if you think you can do better then write a book and see how people will judge your work.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was captivating, brought you in from the very beginning and had some great quotes and insights.  the characters were believable and felt very real to me
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have already written a review on one of the other books but I would like to reiterate how much I enjoyed reading this series. I put off reading this book for months because I heard from several different people how great it was and I just did not believe it could be that good, but boy was I wrong. It was so good I read them twice, and am considering a third time. I don't think any true fan of love and romance will be disappointed by this book, and there are so many other things going on that you can't put it down. Absolutley at the top of my all time favs list and I am a die hard Nicholas Sparks fan but this has surpassed him. Sorry Nick.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much......\\"Hold that thought...\\" In retrospect, i never read any of the books and honestly did not know what all the, \\"Hunger Games\\", hype was all about. Let's just say, I watched this movie not knowing what lied ahead. It blew my mind the impact it had on me. I was so interested in this story that I bought the next two books, \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mocking Jay\\", from Amazon and read book two the following weekend and am currently half way through the third book. This series is full of surprises and twists that will have you guessing until the end. I am 23 yrs old and have not read A BOOK since i was 13 yrs old... \\" ..seriously?\\" \\"YES!!\\" ... I highly recommend this book to anyone... I'm a fan!!.... Who knows what i'll read next...

B005K0HDGE|2.0|This review contains some spoilers!<br /><br />I started reading Stephen King when I was ten years old, first book was Carrie and the beginnings of a life long obsession.  Now in my 30s, I've picked up every book he has written and devoured them.  But my enthusiasm for King has been slowly waning and it's apparent to me that his writing style has changed after the accident and not for the better, in my humble opinion.  But I remained loyal - until this book.<br /><br />The premise of the book is excellent and utterly compelling.  A man with the ability to travel back in time to America late 1950s and prevent one of the greatest human tragedies in history. I expected King to have real fun with this, showing the mess that can be made if we live our lives in the past.  History doomed to repeat itself, etc.  Instead I get a main character who's motivations are not clear to me at all, who thinks he can just simply have a re-do each time it doesn't go his way, and doesn't seem to reflect on the outcomes of his actions at all.  Plus the tinkering with human life by this character without so much as a care turned me off.  I just could not relate to Jake in any way and honestly I didn't really like him.  Add to that King's \\"holier-than-thou\\" Northeast Liberal mindset and you have an unnecessary mess.  I'm writing this from NYC so I know all about this kind of person.  I realize that the 1950s-1960s were not the kindest time in America, but do we have to hear about it on nearly every page?  And do Texans really have to be shown as no teeth neanderthals?  I just want a story - not an exposition on political beliefs. And honestly, does King really think that LBJ was the one human being in America who was capable of passing civil rights?  In King's version JFK lives, LBJ doesn't become president, the Civil Rights Act isn't passed, the \\"Great Society\\" never happens and somehow there's nuclear war and nightmares.  What??  I was astounded by King's tunnel vision on this.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the following, which is a service announcement for anyone thinking of reading the book:  the reason why I devoted time to this colossus was to read about one man preventing JFK's assassination and I don't get the meat/potatoes until roughly 700 pages. And that's after the practical stalking of Oswald by the main character (pages and pages long), which still didn't manage to make Oswald's life even remotely interesting.  Plus an overly long, drawn out, sticky sweet love story that I didn't expect at all.  I understand Mr. King is an artist and wants to change it up a bit here and there, but a tiger can not change his stripes and reading sex scenes from Stephen King is an alternate universe for me.  To be honest, if I knew all of this I wouldn't have bought the book.<br /><br />I'm just adding my two cents as a longtime King fan.  I was simply disappointed.  I think I'll go re-read IT and look for a time portal to take me back to when King was awesome.>My biggest gripe is the following, which is a service announcement for anyone thinking of reading the book:  the reason why I devoted time to this colossus was to read about one man preventing JFK's assassination and I don't get the meat/potatoes until roughly 700 pages.

B007Z9QWVK|2.0|A fairly well made picture but it is certainly revisionist history. I have no doubt that Wallis Simpson saw things this way but, as they say, I think there is more to this story. Her previous marriages had a great impact on this romance, for example, but they are not included. The fact that she fought him on the subject of abdication was glossed over. She certainly never expected to spend the rest of her life in exile but she entered history as a mean spirited gold digger. This movie doesn't change that.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The Fifty Shades Freed is the last book of the trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey. I feel that this book fell a little short. It seems the game room is still there but several items are now gone. What ever do you do with so many canes? In the second book, I felt that each character was telling the other what they wanted from each other. I believe that is what the Fifty Shades Freed is all about. Ana wants less S & M and more feelings, love, and tenderness in the lovemaking. As Chris realizes that Ana is unhappy he goes about making her happy. I didn't feel let down. I just got more sleep with this book than the other two. I also wonder if E.L. James could have had just two books instead of three. I will never know. She is such a great writer that she knew what she was doing. You know that they are going to get married now that Ana is pregnant and Christian always wants to do the right thing. With as much money as he has and makes ($100,000.00 a day) he could make lots of mistakes and still reverse them and come out ahead. I am glad I read the third book. I would have missed all the emotions that goes with love and lovemaking. I never had a gameroom. But, h-m-m-m, maybe I could use the spare bedroom!

B008ENNXQI|1.0|For me and my family this movie was so off target, we couldn't watch the entire flick. Great talent mouthing a horribly bland and tasteless script. This movie was neither humorous nor dramatic and lacked focus. We cared little for all the characters so couldn't endure much of this fiasco although the costumes and staging were eye candy.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I could believe the characters and the action. I hated to see the heroine die but bad things happen. There is plausibility to the story. I hope there is a book in the works to get the brother out of prision...legally. It may already be in print and I haven't come across it yet.  I got the feeling of a true NCIS when reading the book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This review is going to be short and sweet. I usually don't give written reviews when I read a book, but I had to share my thoughts about this one. The first few chapters started off great. The book very quickly became redundant and predictable. The story was very unrealistic--I mean, I know this is a fiction book but GEESH. The characters severely annoyed me and there was waaaaaaaay too much repetition for my liking. After the 2nd sex scene I skimmed through the rest...just so you know the sex scenes are 90% of the book. One of my friends in our book club recommended we read the series. I wouldn't dare purchase book 2 or 3 for that matter.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very happy to see that this is the FAOTD. I bought the first Quell and both games are definitely worth their 99&cent; price. A soothing puzzle game with many levels increasing in difficulty.
1419703692|5.0|An amazingly beautiful put together book.  Even better than I thought it would be.  Beautiful photography!  A must for all fans of movies, art, the Batman Trilogy and Christopher Nolan. I must say also, Christian Bale - the best Batman ever! As the liner notes state, this book tells the complete behind-the-scene story of the three Batman movies. I highly recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is one of the coolest games I know about you control what happends and what to do with the system
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love this album! It is very upbeat and perfect to listen to while running. Pay no attention to the 'explicit' under the title. It's one word in one song, nothing more and I listen to the song anyway, I just skip the last 15 seconds.
B002WNC5BU|5.0|A very well made movie about 3 iconic guitar players different styles for each. Jimmy Page is still such a classy guitarist.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Straight forward and adrenalinic, not as predictable as sometimes prequels are, and it gives a good explanation to the few questions that were left unanswered after the trilogy. Definitely worth reading.
B004LROUNG|4.0|fast paced, appealing characters, mass tort cases are certainly a current theme, Grisham provided humor along with enough drama including  emphasis on accountability to keep the story interesting
B0026IWNZ4|4.0|An excellant movie which fits both kids and adults.  The storyline is unbelievable, but then how do you understand what animals are saying to each other in times of stress.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is so interesting ,awesome , and fun. get it now.I play it all the time and its free. get it
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie.  Can't wait until the second one comes out. I will be buying all 4 movies to complete my set.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|No real difference from regular calculator. works well on the kindle. Wish it was fun or different to het my kids to like it more.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I was happy to buy this recording.download for $5. I was familiar with a couple songs prior, and was glad to see this offered at a nice price. It is a great record!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  I have re-read this book at least 12 times.  It is a book that never gets old and is great for reading while on vacation.
B007LB2B3K|3.0|With the exception of a couple songs this albums predictable cord progressions bore me. If you're a musician, you automatically start catching it in every song. I wish I would have downloaded their single and been done with it.<br /><br />To be fair, this album reminds me drinking and partying to easy hard rock riffs. If you're drunk listening to this than it's a background noise filler, but don't expect too much depth in creativity or musicality from this one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is well produced and directed.  The acting is superb and the story line follows the book very closely. Both the book and the movie will become classics and follow in the footsteps of \\"1984\\", \\"Soylent Green\\", \\"The Fountain Head\\", \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and other great books and movies that depicted the future of mankind. The irony is that \\"1984\\", \\"The Fountain Head\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" are a reality today....
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This season was a tough one, and amazingly continued the story archs that we all know and love. Motorcylces, battles, brawls, cartels, betrayal, family, love, loyalty. A must-see series. Period.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|This Blu-ray looks and sounds unbelievable. As a  3D HDTV owner, you should have this movie. Of all the 3D Blu rays, only a couple are worth owning, this is one of them. The action is pretty impressive but the special effects are mind-melting on a good HDTV.<br /><br />If your looking for a good movie to show off your system, this is as good as it gets.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|totally engrossing movie, kept my attention throughout the movie.  I had tears in my eyes when they made that final charge up the hill. Not the first time I saw the movie, nor will it be the last.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Modern directors just don't get the financing to create such huge movies like this anymore. Peter Jackson was probably the newest entry on the list of \\"creator of worlds\\" directors. Inception was close but close in the same way Batman is which is to take existing locations and beef them up a bit. The sets built for Jurassic Park are legendary and still remain at Universal Studios. There is something about creating everything realistically that lends a certain spatial familiarity.<br /><br />The transfer is fantastic. The picture and sounds are great and it's wonderful to see the groundbreaking special effects, in HD (they hold up quite well). Grab this pack and you won't regret it.<br /><br />P.S. I believe this should be required viewing for children ages 7-11, just will always remain a classic.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good quality streaming. As for the movie it was absolutely amazing and so much better than what I remember from watching in theaters.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I could not put my kindle down, i wanted to read it every spare minute I had.  its a great book!!  I love Philippa Gregory's books!
B008TRUDAS|1.0|This book was not at all what I expected.  I bought it because of the high ratings, and because it was recomended because of the books I had been buying.  I honestly think that the author must have friends and family come on here and rate this for her.  People can't actually be giving this 5 stars.<br />First of all, who does slam poetry?  That was the first red flag.  Then the plot is completely ridiculous and could never happen.  A 21 yr old would not be student teaching his own class, with students he actually went to school with.  Not possible.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down for a minute.. I love all three books but the first n third book are my favorites and hope I will read more about the author
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this is spellbinding and more! is was something else to read what was going through the author's mind and follow how she put it all together. loved all 3 books and want more!
B005ZB91KY|1.0|The action in this movie is pretty good, but isn't that the case with most action movies??  The movie is supposed to be set back in WWII time frame but if it wasn't for the costume design you'd never know it.  Frequent occurances of out of place dialogue and casting for the time frame, I understand the \\"it's a movie about a superhero so how real should it be?\\" argument but that shouldn't be an excuse for not even making an attempt to be in context.  Also I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the special effects to me looked awful at best. I actually laughed audibly during the scene where steve rogers chases (and catches) a vehicle. Unfortunately, as if that wasn't enough, this movie is on rails.  No plot twist and turns, you know exactly what's going to happen and right when it's going to happen.  Characters are super shallow even for an action film. There are far better movies out there, even if the goal is to just waste time.
B004M5HUXE|2.0|Bought this and Fanny  Hill at the same time out of curiousity about two rather famous books.  Didn't particularly care for either; however this one rated a little  higher  due to more story line other than the sex.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thought this was a lovley book that was well writen.  Eventhough it had moments that you were unhappy with the main charachter it is that struggle that made the book compelling to read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me guessing all the way up to the end! Very twisted!! I couldn't put it down and had to finish it within 2 days of starting it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read the 1st 4 books in the series and couldn't wait for this book. They are long and have so many characters but I still love them. The fact that you have to wait from chapter to chapter and book to book makes the books very hard to put down. I love books that take me back to my bed several times a day to read and this one does that.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book!  Wait until at least Part II to decide you don't want to finish it. I was unsure about the book until that point.
B0024CEY36|4.0|I haven't read a Ken Follett novel in years.  Evenly paced with a few turns, I envisioned what London was like in 1914.  A bit more detail on St. Petersburg was missing, given the book's title.  I expect to catch up on other Follett work that I missed.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I bought this movie for my 14 year old daughter's birthday and she just loves it.<br />loved the on demand version as well.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I read this book before I saw the movie and I have to say that I pictured the characters differently. I also thought the movie was a bit too short and didn't hit all of the points made in the book. I love movies and I can honestly say I enjoyed the book more.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was a wonderful read!<br /><br />I loved the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and was sad to see that end, but this new series brings to life a different set of characters and I really enjoy the storyline. I cannot wait for The Mark of Athena to come out this October!<br /><br />Happy reading :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|I absolutely have never read such a touching book! This and point of retreat are among the best books I have ever read! I laughed, cried, and cheered during this sweet book! Great job mrs.hoover!
B00004Z459|5.0|I usually like only couple of songs from an artist or a band, but I enjoy listening to every single song from Linkin Park. Unlike others, they did not stick to one style of music. Some people criticize them negatively for their latest albums but I rather listen to something new than hearing songs with the same music but different lyrics. You gotta give them credit for experimenting with different stuff than sticking to what makes them the most money.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Cannot wait for the second one to come out. I needed an awesome book to read after 50 shades trilogy and thank goodness this was out! Waiting patiently for the 2nd book.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I think this album may be my least favorite from Linkin Park. However, That does not mean I don't like it.
B0081L391C|5.0|I loved this movie. Saw it a few times in theaters. It is hilarious they play on all the stereotypes in movies like this.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I haven't yet finished it, becuase it hasn't really caught my attention. It's not bad, but not particularly grand either.....Meh
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie has a great story it is delivered well and had something for everyone I have watched it a tone of times with my kids and still are not bored of it
B006BAEQB2|5.0|As usual, Phillipa Gregory has another hit.  I've read all the books in this series.  The fact that this gave the other side of the story was not only refreshing but sometimes eye opening.  A great read !
B001F0WXY0|4.0|The book is epic in time frame, space, and characters. There are feints withing feints within feints to quote the book. Each character has their own unique motivation that drives them forward to the end of others or their own end. It was pleasant to read it after seeing the movie a couple times growing up. Worth the long week I spent reading it each free minute.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Very exciting. By the time I finished I could not wait  to read book. Four. It was a great read.
B000OLX4SU|5.0|Great, modern interpretation of a classic. Visually it is stunning, and the acting is very dramatic (as it should be for such a dramatic tale). Plus, Robert DeNiro plays the Frankenstein monster...need I say more!?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book makes you feel what we all like to think and that is that our pets understand our every word and mood and love us unconditionally.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Movie seemed to rush into different scenes...good action...but never felt the connection with the main character. It's shallowly but entertaining at the same time.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|This movie died at the box office after withering reviews.  We watched with low expectations, and were plesantly surprised.  Good action, plot and acting.  Not Star Wars, but what is??
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|As with the other books of this series, the story pulls you in with a force.  You can smell the woods and see the blood as Diana continues to create her web of adventure, intrigue and romance.  Start at the beginning of her series and look forward to some great reading.
B0074V3712|5.0|I love this book.  I took a class in molecular anthropology last year and E.O. Wilson confirmed most of what I learned about the interaction of environment as well as heredity in the expression of DNA.  I recommend it.
B000JMKNVK|4.0|Quirky dialogue and truly evil villain all add up to a quick, entertaining and easy read. Lehane continues the Kenzie-Gennaro relationship and captures beautifully each character's angels and demons.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was great, the quality of the blu-ray is amazing and the bonus material was very entertaining. My whole family loved this DVD.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Every woman should read this book!<br /><br />You don't have to agree with everything Moran says to appreciate and take value from the book. In fact Moran would probably encourage it. She just wants to encourage women be free independent people, not stuck in a world ruled by men.<br /><br />Every man should read this book!<br /><br />This is an entertaining quick read that will give you a massive insight into the triumphs and tribulations of the modern woman.
B008602KQI|4.0|It had a slow beginning, the plot is pretty obvious but it was entertaining which in the final analysis is all that matters
0307341550|4.0|Good book, easy to read. I had the ending figured out very early in the book, but still really enjoyed reading it. I really like the way this author writes, this is the second book of hers that I've read and look forward to reading others.
B008133DO8|5.0|I've been a Sherlock fan for over 30 years. This a really creative way to bring Conan Doyle up to date. Great stories, great dialog, very quick humor and fast paced. Terrific job!! Can't wait for season 3.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was better than one and way better than three. I am not really sure where all the hooplaa about these books comes from they were not that freaky but the love story was pretty sweet. Not worth $10.00.
B008LP8QE8|5.0|Harrison internal medicine is the best reference book for everyone who Study medicine!! I recomend it, you must have it in your library!!!!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|An amazing tale about the search for, and encounter with, a shy breed of people who run very long distances for the sheer fun of it. If you are interested in barefoot and minimalist running, then this is a must read.
B00571F26Y|2.0|I thought this book might be something new but after the author goes on and on about the benefits of not eating wheat he then suggests you cut down on other carbs too.  Same old thing.  I am trying it (cutting out only the wheat) and I haven't really lost much weight but I do feel less bloated and feel like I've lost some inches.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this trilogy!!!!! One of the best stories I have read in along time.  Can't wait to see what else E.L. James writes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Can't put it down.  Twists and turns you wouldn't expect.  Highly recommend for great entertaining reading.  I haven't finished it yet and can't figure out where it's going to go next.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|This is a good ending to the series.  Still funny and Stiffler is still an idiot but it's a cute coming of age conclusion to the series.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The night circus was compelling cinematic and a great read altogether.  I galloped through it and will have to reread it in a more leisurely fashion sometime soon.  The story of a magical contest between two evenly matched opponents with great powers made me wistful in the midst of this election year.  I think it should be suitable for children who are up to Harry Potter and all interested adults.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Even better than season 1.  Set during the war and covering the influenza epidemic makes this series historical as well as fictional.  That house is amazing and all the characters have grown so much.  Yeah, Edith and Mary.  You have both matured and mellowed.  And Maggie Smith is one of the best characters.  Loved the Christmas episode!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|No spoilers here.  Just want to say I was hooked from chapter 1.  So many twists & turns.  Now I impatiently wait for book 6.
B006WQLH7G|2.0|Avast is great on my computer but for my phone it was bad. Wanted me to disable a program on my phone which I needed, bad news. I rated it two stars.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love these books, such an escape -- and they are long and there are 7 of them! My cable TV and Internet have been out for four days and I don't care because I am so deep into these books. Great series (and great HBO show too).
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book started out a little slow for me but after 30 pages I didn't want to put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was told to read this if I like \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". What a recommendation! Yes, there are some similarities, but this book stands on its own well and has a different depth to it. I can't wait for October for the release of book #2!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A good read for anyone whose interested.its addictive, witty, and sensual. You will not regret this purchase if it is made. Enjoy.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|This product is AMAZING! The graphics are smooth and clean. Takes the ps2 version to all new heights! I don't have a 3d TV but with the way this looks there really is no need! A+ work!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I purchased Book 1 of \\"50\\" with a bit of trepidition.<br />Having read some of the book, I was not sure this<br />was for me and put it down,  BUT  was drawn back<br />to finish at least Book 1.  By the end of Book 1<br />I was hooked and immediately purchased Book 2 and 3.<br />These are well written and actually have a good story line.<br />I must admit that the reading was quite educational.<br />Not for the prudish among us, but well worth the read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A quick read, but only because you can't put it down! Mysterious, whimsical, charming, emotional, and full of twists and turns that will keep you on your toes, The Night Circus is a beautifully written love story that all ages can enjoy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|They may not been the best writting, but I am on my third read. Once I finish i just have to start again. I hope there are more books, can not wait for the movie.
B0067R0APK|5.0|from one weather lover to another... job well done bro. job well done. you spanked it right out of the park. yea baby.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books and I love the movie..it was a great deal from Amazon, and i can watch on my kindle with the free version from them, also came with a Itunes download as well so i have it on my phone
B0049MPHZI|5.0|Read it first in french without knowing anything about the author since then I bought all his other books in english.<br /><br />With Iain M.banks, Alastair is my favourite hard science fiction author.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Memories it brings back of a trip my family took with a couple  who have been life long friends of my parents. We went to Vermont and stayed a few days with the man's father! My father, knowing how much I loved the movie, the Von Trapp Family singers and be a music lover himself took us to Stowe, Vermont where we toured the original \\"Lodge\\". It looked like a Swiss Chalet. I was saddened to hear it had burned down but glad they rebuilt a larger one.We visited before Maria's death in 1987. I loved the book. However the set I bought came with a little Music box that plays Adelwiese.
B008602KQI|4.0|The wife and I watched it the day I received it in the mail.  I found it hard to follow so will need to view it at least two more times to get the entire idea from it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending for the trilogy, easy reading, just don´t expect one of the greatest written novel but one great love story that makes you dream.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|This was the best Season so far watching Dexter.  Can't wait to start Season 5.  Totally shocking at the end.  Highly recommend watching this show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading all 3 books.  I thought it was very entertaining.  I loved both of the main characters, they seemed like real people. I would definitely read more from this author.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old son. I dont know which one of us plays it more! great game! it is simple enough for him, but advanced enough to keep me entertained!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was dissapointed in the book after hearing everyone talking about it so much.<br /><br />I really thought it could of been better and expected more from it.
B007HNFREW|4.0|Oh that's just great! Just what I need(NOT)! Another wonderful, incredible, engaging, mind-blowing world in which to be come lost and immersed for hours on end.  I can't wait to do it again!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Its alot of fun. Reminds me of the one we had in our basement many many yrs ago.<br />When I was a teenager we play with my granmother. The only thing is the flippers they are hard to see and to keep them going
B008602KQI|1.0|I had heard that the book was very good, not knowing too much about the story behind it. However, I felt that the story was extremely sad in the fact, that isn't there enough violence in the world and in the movies, that an author wrote such a story about killing children as a game, why did you write this story, is my question? The movie and actors was done well, but I will never buy or watch another movie like this again, awful idea for a book and movie.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Excellent movie. I didn't think I would like it, but it kept my attention from the beginning to the end. Interesting plot.
0198534469|5.0|I first read this book in 2001. I have now re-read it and I hope to re-read it many more times.  This is an exceptional book and I am dumbfounded by how illuminating it has been with a second read 11 years later.  The author makes a distinct effort to provide deep (principally geometric) insights into complex analysis as well as connections between complex analysis and non-Euclidean geometry as well as physics. The power of visualization and the amplitwist concept is clear.  I still need to re-read this book to get the most out of it but the explorations of conformal mappings/analyticity/harmonic functions from the multiple viewpoints was a unique and deeply rewarding experience.    See the website: [...]
B0081X40HW|5.0|We followed Haley when she was on American Idol. We thought she should have won, but to take 3rd place shows she was extremely talented as a singer. I am glad she has an album out now. I bought it and i am glad I did. Highly recommended!
B005XBKXV2|5.0|I purchased this video for my iPad to take to Honduras on a mission's trip.  The kids in Honduras loved it.  I would highly recommend this video and Amazon is the way to go.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The kindle edition was a great buy.  Having four of the five book in one shot.  It was like having one long book.  Very well written.  A great read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a wonderful read.  Very interesting plot and a surprising ending.  I loved it, and would recommend it to everyone.
B004GKMV16|5.0|I love this author. Just like New York, this novel tells the history of a city through fictional families.<br />It is made more enjoyable with kindle as I can take a detour to Wikipedia or the dictionary to fully understand the facts.<br />This book takes you away to another place just as a good book should.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is a book of revival in many ways through words,the explicit expression of love at times<br />Is allot to absorb. Who knew?
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book and was looking forward to the second.  I thought it carried the story forward very well but as it went forward, I thought the story and setting were too manufactured.  Now, while I did like the first book better, finishing the second book left me wanting to start the third book immediately.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Even if you have zero interest in ultra or the normal marathons, this is truly a great motivational book of the human spirit.  For anyone who says, \\"I can't do that\\", this book proves we all have the potential to do it. Based with scientific fact this book is a powerful tool why we all should learn to run at least a few miles a day and the benefits one can experience from running.  It makes a person think, \\"I'd rather be prepared for something that never happens than unprepared for something that does\\".
B00340I4KG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  The BluRay quality is very good.  It is a must for anyone who collects movies.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This book is not the best written book I've read and the way some of the scenes were described could have been better, same with some of the characters for that matter too...<br />Was an easy read though and easily a series that could have fitted into one book...<br />After a while the sex scenes just kinda go over your head and you end up reading more to find out about Mr Greys unique personality.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was difficult to put down.  I enjoyed the novel from beginning to end.  I never anticipated the twists and turns of the journey the book took me through. It was Great!!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is great to be able to access my work computer from my phone, kindle or laptop for no cost and super easy. I love this app and recommend it to everyone.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have read the entire series. Well actually, I am finishing the last book now.  I love this series because it allows me to forget where I am and become part of the story.  Everything I look to a book to do.
B008602KQI|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is quite possibly my favorite movie in a long time. I don't often go to see movies in the theaters when they first come out or purchase movies on DVD. I did both of those for this movie. I also liked it so much I even read the second and third books. If you knew me, you would know how unusual that is. I haven't read more than a couple books for pleasure ever. I definitely recommend this to movie to any Sci-fi/action/romance fans. It has everything, except comedy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am very happy with this book. I love how I can go to amazon and click on whatever book I want to purchase and it downloads right to my kindle. I am loving this trilogy.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I love flow free, but the more you play the harder it gets. I mean really hard!! A fun, verychallenging game for anyone!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read the books at my daughter's insistence. I was pleased that the film didn't pay as much attention to the book's adolescent dilemma of \\"which boy do I like best?\\", and I was happy to find that the film had a more overtly political slant, though I suspect that the right wing will miss the exploitative relationship of the ruling elite and the toiling masses and only see resistance to oppression, ie \\"black helicopters\\".
B0053TMP24|4.0|Great book.. i can't wait for the next book in the series to come out. Great series. A must read for all into greek and roman mythology.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I purchased this at Kindle recommendation from other books I've read.  This is my first read of Gillian Flynn, and I must say it started a little slow, but I stuck with it and it picked up after a few chapters and I ended up enjoying the book.  I will try another of this authors works and see if it is better.  Does anyone have suggestions for which to buy?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|\\"American Sniper\\" is an excellent account of an elite service member's point of view in our current conflict. Chris Kyle provides an honest look at what goes on in our military's operations from the perspective of the operator himself.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I kept hearing on TV, on the radio, on the web and in person how amazing this book is, so I finally broke down and bought it on Kindle. I gave it a go, and found the storyline intriguing and the style of writing to be excellent. However, the farther I got into the book, the more annoyed I became with the main character, Anastasia. She is drawn completely out of her element and continues to do things that she does not want to do, simply because she is smitten with some rich guy and doesn't have any clue what real love is. I found myself relating to her character in so many ways throughout the first half of the book, but finally became disgusted with the character's utter lack of self-respect. I'm sorry, I know millions of people are raving about it, but for me, 50 Shades of Grey was a huge disappointment. I gave it 2 stars only because I loved the writer's literary style. The story, on the other hand...... not my cup of tea.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Although the book is pretty old, it's story still manages to surprise the reader. The beginning, as in many books, starts off slow with introducing the characters but once characters start to die on the island, it gets hard to put the book down. I recommend keeping a list of the characters and trying to solve the mystery as you read but I doubt many readers will be able to.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I lol'd multiple times during this movie.  I expected Jonah Hill to be funny but Channing Tatum really lead the way.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this last book. Although some of it is a bit predictable and a maybe even a bit repetetive. Yet, After reading the first one I was hooked. Had to know what happens next. So much so that when I finished this third book I am still left wanting more.. I now feel like I know the characters personally and although I was satisfied with the conclusion I feel like there are some unanswered questions! Maybe a book from Christian's point of view? Overall great read.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is terrible in so many ways. It barely warrants a review, but here goes...<br /> It's just a romance novel. Not sure what the hype is about except that randomly it became popular, and therefor socially acceptable, to explore BDSM fiction... Yay. I won't speak to that aspect of the story as, even though it's not my thing, I don't have any issue with others being into it. To each their own, etc. The writing is painfully awful, the plot is boring, it's a rip off of someone else's already weak characters, and even the sex scenes are average at best. So tired of hearing about his mouth forming a hard line and everybody's breath hitching...
B006G2124E|5.0|We watched \\"The Help\\" with three generations of women.  The younger women asked many questions and so a very meaningful dialogue took place. Not only was the movie entertaining it was very educational.  True life drama and wonderful humor thoughout.
B0076303RY|5.0|Part 6 had me on the edge of my seat - i never like anything soapy - but this show definitely has just the right mixture of drama, adventure, romance, and suspense... Part 6 is a nice example..
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is an awesome time waster. I love it!!  While waiting for the bus, on thebus or at that boring doctor's appt. Keeps your mind off the screaming kid in the next seat.
B0070TDERU|5.0|Part four is for me where it all is at.  A lot of the stories from the beginning of this series are tied together in some ways. I like this episode a lot.
B0087240Z4|5.0|Reminds me of their Melloncollie album but of course with a different style. Nothing really hard hitting but the overall flow of the album is cool. It could be played indefinitely and I wouldn't tire of it. The end.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|This is one of those shows that keeps you thinking and the period it is set in makes it all the more interesting! Great acting :D Good Characters - I cant wait til season 3!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a page turner.  Well written, no cliches, a roller coaster ride depicting a marriage with the deft strokes of a Hitchcock movie...New York City's upper Westside,the intelectual snobbery, nthe courtship, the marriage all just a warm up act till the actual wife goes missing......This book is not a literary masterpiece bit for entertainment is is...the perfect ironic suspense tale to curl ip with and escape into another world.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is a great video to get you back into a workout routine!  It really works and if you stick with it you will see inches come off!
B0081L37Z0|1.0|this movie was not good as i thought. there was way to much profanity. if you have young kids this movie is not suitable for them.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very happy with order. Extremely excited to get started on the book. One of the best book series of all time. George R.R. Martin is a genius.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Couldn't put the book down all through out!  When it was done I said \\"WTH ?\\"  Would not reccomend to anyone.  Hated final pages.
B008K3HRF0|1.0|Bought this for the kids to watch on the way to our vaction they were not interest at all, I tryed to watch it to but did not make and sence, Sorry did not really like it at all.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Too much hype for such a mediocre book! Not any better than any other romance type novel. The characters are not relateable either.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The books and movie are amazing. I would highly recommend to watch. Looking forward to part two of hhe series.
B008DVJO8C|1.0|I was very eager for this CD to come out. I am a big ITM fan and when the single Blood hit the radio I couldn't wait for more.  Unfortunately, I found the entire rest of the CD to be a huge disappointment.  I found many of the songs to be a bit odd and just not was I was expecting at all.  Maria has a beautiful voice when she sings and it has always been mixed with screaming on their other albums but there was just too much screaming on this CD.  I miss the good old In This Moment from the Beautiful Tragedy days.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|In some ways this story conjures up a travel adventure such as Steinbeck's \\"Travels with Charley.\\"  The characters encountered on Harold's walking journey run the gamut of personalities and their interactions with and reactions to his quest.  I enjoyed the back-and-forth in narrative between his adventure and his wife's situation and reactions at home.  How their marriage was rekindled was a touching, believable scenario.
B004N622EY|3.0|It's difficult to rate novels with this star system. So much depends on what the author set out to do in the first place. If \\"Mistborn\\" was trying to compete with, say, George R. R. Martin's \\"GOT\\", then I would rate it one star. If, on the other hand, the writer was aiming at Harry Potter's fans, then I'd say it deserved three stars, as opposed, for example, to 4 stars for \\"Hunger Games\\" in the same category. I think one should have more telling units of measurement according to genre. Stars are misleading. You buy a book because Amazon readers rate it highly, but then it turns out to be raves from a very narrow range of fans. So be warned here :  \\"Mistborn\\" borrows from different categories;  it's part fantasy, with an original twist to the theme of magic and magicians but also a dash of science fiction with technologically enhanced individuals ; there is Dickensian cuteness, with a poor little orphan girl surviving around lowlife and being restored to a sense of self-esteem and confidence by a supportive group of adults; there is social  criticism in the \\"Metropolis\\" tradition, denouncing an authoritarian society that favors the highborn and rich while oppressing a servile class - with absolutely no middle ground between the two, except perhaps the small band of heroes that seek to fight the system. It has romance, the beggar maid meeting Prince Charming at the ball and seducing him with her unusual blend of toughness and unsophisticated spontaneity (Bizarrely the people at the ball sound like a bunch of American high-schoolers, says the kids in \\"Glee\\", all jock worship and scorn for the less favored). \\"Mistborn\\" also bears faint traces of the Bildungsroman (Don't think Goethe, but perhaps \\"Karate Kid\\", or  \\"Star Wars\\" as in Luke Skywalker meets Yoda) with the heroin being taught how to successfully tap her magic powers in the course of grueling lessons but also to overcome deeply ingrained reflexes as she learns to trust people, make friends and find pleasure inthe company of others.<br /><br />There is a plot of sort, with a beginning and an end and a few ingenious solutions to the problems faced by the heroes. There is some character development, mainly affecting the hero and her mentor.  It has very few irritating idiosyncrasies (so far, but this is the first installment of a saga). Basically it's an OK book, but definitely not addictive in my opinion, unless you are a young, unsophisticated reader, which is your birthright. Fans of GRRM, enter with low expectations.
B0028INIWE|5.0|I grew up with the Grateful Dead, but never actually became a 'deadhead'.  The music was always on the stations I listened to, and the tracks on this album were all very familiar to me.  In keeping up with the technological changes as to how I listen, this was a fantastic addition to my music library.  I find myself listening to it a lot and having some very pleasant 'flashbacks'  :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Interesting story line. Book twists control back and forth. In reality Ana is in total control.  Would recommend this book. Much sexual content so not for children.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's neat!  I don't know what else they ad to it when you buy it, but the free one is awesome
B004QZ9P6K|4.0|3 different people told me to read this book. With an economy that is faltering, having new ideas about ways to start creative businesses is key.  the book explains why Israel is successfu, but it also does much more.  the writing style a strong keeps your attention.  I would recommend this read to anyone curious about business and what it takes to be successful.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The only improvement I would make is to be warned when repinning something I may already have, or is at least similar.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Gets gradually harder. But it starts sufficiently difficult and is fun. A a a a a a a a a a
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a page turner! I look forward to seeing what happens in the next two books! Mr. Grey is a trip.
B002YDFK6A|4.0|After reading the book for a book-group challenge I had an urge to watch the movie also. I was not disappointed. Like the book (see my separate review of that) it was just simple, just about love without any unnecessary drama. It followed the book to the letter without change or embellishment which is just what I wanted to see. If you are going to watch this movie I would recommend reading the book first as they just go together like, well, Oliver and Jennifer!<br /><br />I have dropped a star because Ali McGraw just was not a good actor in this, very forced and wooden and also because Jennifer looked far too healthy when she was on her deathbed - surely they had some pale makeup even back in 1970!!<br /><br />It also made me think about whether it would have been actually possible for them to pay Harvard Law School tuition on the money they were making from Jenny's job and their summer jobs. Ok, I know it is a movie and I am slightly overthinking it but this picked away at my brain a bit. Surprisingly it never occurred to me while reading the book.<br /><br />The appearance of a very young Tommy Lee Jones (or Tom Lee Jones as he called himself then) brought a big smile to my face.<br /><br />A classic anyone who loves love should watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it!!! Couldnt put it down. Glad I didnt listen to the bad reviews I read. It was exciting, romantic, a little sappy but one of my new all time favs. Cant wait to see what this author has next.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this cover!  Color is great--it is sturdy!  Would definitely recommend! I like the way it bends back and you can read without having to hold open the cover and the closure tab works well!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Excellent read - picked up the first five chapters and before I was done I bought the book... Can't wait for the other Lunar Chronicles to be published!
B004XVN1T4|5.0|First off I have to admit that I love Folletts books.  This one was very exciting and had some historical significance.  The characters were well developed and interesting.  The time period was just after WW2 to 1968.  The storyline was very believable and detailed.  If you're looking for a good read don't hesitate to get this!
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazing moving depicting life in a possible futuristic post world war world. It reminded me of a Japanese movie I saw many years ago called Battle Royal, but much less gruesome.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|My wife read the book. And she loved the movie. I haven't read the book. Now that I saw the movie it has me interested in the other books. Looking forward to the next movie!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|If you are looking for a fast entertaining read, this is a great choice.  Plus, you get the bonus of being motivated to go and enjoy running like it was when you were a kid.  You didn't need a reason, you just went out and enjoyed being free.  The book will educate you about the latest trends and research in running, while mixing in great story lines. My favorite aspect of the book was the research and discussion related to the anthropology and physiology of human development and how distance running played a large role in homo sapiens growth. Runners and non-runners alike will enjoy this book.
B007APG16U|1.0|As someone who absolutely loves tyga i bought this for instant download and was so excited, ignoring the other reviews about how it was not a good album i could not see that being possible, but it defiantly is. buy the songs you know because the rest are not worth your money. well done 3 is the best mixtape and its free if you want good tyga download that, this is not worth the 9$ even.
B008602KQI|4.0|I had just finished reading the book when I purchased the movie. I think its hard for a movie to compete because of time limits, but the producers, directors and actors of the film did an excellent job telling this incredible, compelling story. I defintely see a sequel.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|At age nineteen, Anne Elliott was persuaded to give up Frederick Wentworth, a young naval office. Though she loved him and continues to love him, he could not provide her with the security and prestige her family felt was her due. He goes off to sea and Ann settles down to a life of servitude to her family. Years later, a wealthy Captain Wentworth returns with the idea of marrying -- not Ann but one of her young in-laws.<br /><br />When I first read Persuasion, I was too young to understand Anne's position. Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.<br /><br />Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice. It takes time to warm to the main characters. If you give it that time, Anne and Frederick's love story is well worth the effort.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly is an articulate and amusing book about a very serious problem. Our country faces a very real and imediate health crisis, and the obesity of millions of Americans is a contributing factor.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was done well highlighting major stages in story. Wish it was longer to capture more details as it went by fast.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|I think the first episode was better; probably because it was so different and new.  This second episode was a continuation, but not as radically new.
B008602KQI|5.0|I went to see The Hunger Games with my 18 and 21 y/o daughters, not having any idea what I was getting into...I was mesmerized. I cannot remember the last time I had to remind myself to breathe during a film but I often did during this one. For days afterward I re-lived scenes from the movie in my mind, wrestling with the thought, \\"Could something like this happen to us here in the USA?\\" I also went home and read all three books. The movie is very intense and certainly not for younger audiences but those who are willing to ponder the outcome of bigger and more intrusive government might enjoy and/or be scared silly by it.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|The price was right, and I recevied just what I paid for. The Weather app that came with the Kindle is  just as good.<br />I wish the $$ app had the moon phases.
B00845PRDS|4.0|Gives a good idea about US Special Forces & their sacrifices to keep us safe! Thanks to all our Soldiers, Airmen, Marines & Coast Guardsmen past, present & future!<br />\\"The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by our nation.\\"- George Washington
B004E5GG50|4.0|Too bad The Tudors focused just on 1 Tudor, Henry VIII. There were 5 Tudor rulers, some of them actually decent and fairly just most of the time. The series is exceedingly well acted and gorgeous in its cinematography. A little knowledge of actual history of the times would come in handy when viewing the series. The show likes to focus a lot on sex and sexual politics, which, since it was created for Showtime, may not be all that surprising. The first seasons when dealing with Henry and his obsession with Anne Boleyn are the best parts. Natalie Dormer plays Anne exceptionally well and you may find yourself falling in love with her too. The rest of the wives may charm you too, but, they pale in comparison. The show gets a little gruesome and sometimes hard to watch when Henry goes off the deep end. I found myself switching to other DVDs and entertainments as exhaustion from tortures and beheadings started to set in. It's likely all true, but, it does get a bit tiresome. I recommend buying the first 2 seasons, then getting the last 2 from the local library; you can return them easier if you aren't into barbarism.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|It really says something about the quality of the app that I have it on three devices and play it all the time, and all it is is dots.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob held my attention from beginning to end. I could not put it down. Ever wondered how far parents would go to protect their child? Well, read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone girl is an amazing book. It will keeping you guessing from beginning to end. When you think you have everything figured out, think again. Shell throw another angle at you! This book is a must read!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A nice tidy way to bring the love story to an end.  However, parts of the book seemed redundant, but a few twists and turns helped to keep my interest.  So far the Fifty Shades Trilogy has been fun to read.
B000QGAU4E|4.0|Wow, what an intense movie, which makes you stop and think currently about overzealous governments and futuristically about what may come.  The video and audio presentation, in my opinion, was outstanding.  Great theatrical contributions by Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore.  Am I glad that I purchased it for our library?  You bet I am.
0143119680|4.0|For the most part, I liked A Discovery of Witches very much. I liked watching Diana finally embrace her legacy as a powerful witch although I found the fact that she was the most powerful witch to be a bit over the top. I thought the romance between Matthew and Diana to be a good portrayal of love between two cultures (I'm Jewish and my husband is Chinese so I have some experience with that situation), but having Matthew refuse to consummate their relationship was the biggest turnoff for me in the entire story. I absolutely loved Diana's Aunt Sarah's magical house but I hated the cliffhanger ending. I realize that Matthew got pretty autocratic at times but I found that to be completely in character. I thought Diana's failure to follow his orders when he told her to get away from dangerous people seemingly to assert her independence to be very foolish but understandable. There was quite a lot of detail in the narrative that probably should have been excised but unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find that it interfered with telling the story. I was very impressed with the proofreading; it was a pleasure not to be interrupted by grammatical mistakes or typos. The style was more scholarly than one usually finds in paranormal romances, and I enjoyed that aspect very much.<br /><br />Overall, there is a lot more positive than negative factors in this book and I have been anxiously awaiting the sequel (which I just purchased). I definitely recommend this book.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|First, the video and audio are first-rate for this Blu-Ray release (if you watch, as we did, through a surround receiver, you're probably going to have to tone the sound down).  All-in-all, the movie is very entertaining; however, being a Sherlock Holmes purist, I could not \\"get into\\" this release.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|GOOD BOOK..COULDN'T PUT DOWN MORE THAN ONCE..AUTHOR SURE KNOWS HOW TO DRAG YOU IN AND MAKE YOU FEEL YOU ARE PART OF THE STORY. GREAT CONTINUATION TO THE GREAT MR.GREY. EAGER TO START THE OTHER ONE!
B004XISI4A|5.0|I loved the whole series so far, I read them one after another and now I am in limbo awaiting the next two, will have to settle for the series on HBO to keep me going because I really enjoyed it as well.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Being a fan of George Clooney, I thought this was a touching story of love, deceit, discovery, forgiveness and renewal.  Superbly acted by all and filmed on location in Hawaii.  This is as real as it gets for a family whose ancestors provided property that would be considered priceless and the executor with a decision that would affect the lives of an entire generation.  Loved the twists, the turns and the ultimate ending to a wonderful excursion into the lives of these decendents of harmoninous mixed ancestory.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was a good movie but nothing really to rave about. The cinematic  picture was good and I am pretty sure the books are a lot better.Now time to order the books
B0089X38EU|5.0|This seminal Stax album has been released by Concord as part of its Stax Re-Masters release - apart from the inclusion of the original album sleeve with the Stax logo - and 2 live tracks which are awful in their sound quality - this mono album does not sound very much different from the Bill Inglot remastered version on the Atlantic/Atco Remasters series in the 1990s. Five stars for the timeless music - 1 star to Concord for bothering to re-reelease it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My movie arrived quickly is great condition!!! This movie is awesome!!!! Even on my less than amazing old TV the HD comes through! Hooray! Great movie. Great purchase.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really love this app for those nights when you are so tired you can't relax.  It really does the job and I am glad I have it!<br /><br />I love being able to add sounds and remove sounds in \\"layers\\".  Plus, the timer function is really nice.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|she does an awesome job with pics.. no need for the hype like certain others...nice work a little more borders besides that great..Insta-who??
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Dearest reader,<br />This is a quiet tale.  It seeps through the countless years and lays bare the raw nerves that are people touching other people's lives.  You will feel anger at injustice.  You will brush away tears of joy.  Your heart will break because of the kind of sadness only found at the bottom of the deepest and darkest well.  You know that celebratory arm pumping gesture people do when they pass a hard test or find a $20 bill in their old jeans?  You will do that.  Reader, you will stand up and cheer.<br />Buy this book immediately.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I purchased a Coldplay song recently. \\"When I rule the world\\" is absolutely amazing! It's enthusiastic sounding, energizing, engaging, overall fabulous!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use the app daily ive had no big issues with it yet. I can view everything and it doesn't take too long to load.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|I enjoy solitare.  It really relaxes me at then end of a long day.  Actually I am addicted to it.  I won't stop playing until I win.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I just got this to get me up earlier than usual for exercise in the morning.  It does the trick for that, and I love the \\"wordy\\" clock face.  I can see using this app if I travel or even to my family's house on the Cape where there is NO clock in the guest room!  So, haven't used a lot of the options, but love what I have!
B000SEFM6K|5.0|I loved this book. It had a great mystery and a wonderful love story. I will certainly read anything Wilkie Collins writes.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the books.  T though the first book was good but the second book was even a little better.  I was not sure about the last book, it kind of lagged a bit.  I still enjoyed the series and would love to read about the rest of the family and their relationships and hear more about Anastasia and Christian's life.
0525953728|5.0|I've read a lot of books about the military, military history, special forces and this book is outstanding.  Be very wary of the one star reviews from people who haven't even read the book and sound jealous that they spent their military career guarding parking lots or whatever.<br /><br />Being former military and having a clearance and having actually read this book I'm not seeing any secrets jumping out at me here.  I think the Pentagon just doesn't like us being aware of basic acronyms like DEVGRU.  I'm reminded of that book by Lt. Col. Shaffer (Operation Dark Heart) which was initially released in unredacted form, and then a ridiculous redacted version came out where innocuous terms like SIGINT, TAREX and even actor Ned Beatty's name were blacked out.  Really?  Way to go Abominable administration.  You guys including the pres himself can blab all he wants about any subject and leak like a sieve on any subject but the backbone of the military (the trigger pullers) can't?<br /><br />I've read dozens of books by SEALs and what was most refreshing to me was not being taken once again through a class at BUD/S.  A little background on the author's life is provided and then we jump right into team 6 training and then missions.<br /><br />I think the book is well-written.  The author is self effacing and I think the information presented is very balanced.  This is not a hooray for me memoir, it's about the team.  It's a wonderful insight into what happened that night.  I liked the diagrams at the end of the book that break down the assault stage by stage.<br /><br />Many may not be aware but Chuck Pfarrer wrote the first book on Neptune Spear (from access he had to DEVGRU guys being former DEVGRU himself) SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was not even slow at the beginning! It eas suspenseful and very exciting! So much action, I just loved it from the from the start! Everyone should have this movie, it's a keeper!
B008NMT684|5.0|My 4 year old grandson loved this game but I will admit he quickly got through the puzzles that came with the free version and I invested the additional few dollars to get the full version.  It was well worth the additional price.  It is the first game he askes for when he askes to play my kindle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|addictive little game. nice colors. very easy to grasp concept. definitely fun. would recommend this game to people of all ages.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Loooooooove it! I honestly don't know how I survived without it. Great recipes, diy crafts, and easy to use. Five stars!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I learned more about history then I would have thru any history books. I found that just given the facts thru many sources it painted un-bias look at the presidents. It also valudated what I had always thought, One can't make statements on what they would due until they've sat in that chair. And that thru the politics friends can be made. I recommend this book to anyone who want's insight to history of the presidents.
B008602KQI|5.0|Although not nearly as raw and painful as the book, the movie still delivers the great story of tragedy and triumph. Great casting as well- will watch again.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Awesome, bloody, kinda cheesy, skips story to get to action. you like pure action, check it. its worth a watch.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|This is the best documentary I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone even if you're not a racing fan. Please see this film.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book would not disappoint you once you start to read your not going to want to put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|This item was for my grandchildren to entertain themselves. I personally did not use it. It did keep them occupied for the whole weekend.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|The movie is good, I liked it more the second time I watched it.  It is a little slow at times for my taste but my daughter said to give it 5 stars.  My kids enjoyed it more than I did.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|The author obviously doesn't really know what MPs in the Army do. Or what Army service is like in general. The Jack Reacher character, the protagonist!, is COMPLETELY unbelievable. The author doesn't know firearms (revolvers? really? Snub nosed .38? He's kidding us, right?) The love interest story line was silly and adolescent in nature. The entire novel is a joke.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You definitly have to read all 3 books to get the concept of this story. Enjoyed all 3! Love how it ended!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Now, the first time I heard about this book, Tom Leykis (who's back again) said that it was his favorite book. Since the book was available on kindle and reading digitally is cool, I dropped the dollars to buy it.<br /><br />It is stunning how this book puts wealth and income into perspective. People that make fairly unremarkable incomes can become full on multi-millionaires and people, like doctors, lawyers, and all those others we think are wealthy, are just a few weeks or months away from being broke. Imagine being the guy that makes the epic income and becomes the millionaire. Read the book, apply the lessons. If it doesn't change the way you look at money, you were either on the right track already or you need to read it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although a bit predictable, this is a great series.  I couldn't put it down.  Hope to hear more from Christian and Anastasia's antics.
B008602KQI|5.0|My wife read the books and wanted to see the movie. I did not think that I would enjoy it but, boy was I wrong. The movie is directed and acted very well and also moves at a consistent pace. Can't wait for the next one!
0425263908|5.0|This was an excellent book. Another steamy love story! Can't wait for book #2 to come out October 2, 2012
B005BV0BA2|5.0|Yes Iron Maiden made use of keyboards on this album but do not let that detur you. This is one of the best Maiden albums of all time. All the songs from start to finish are great,the guitar work and vocal melodies are terrific. Get the re-mastered version because its louder and the original version sounds quite compared to new music today. If Maiden had one album that would fit in with modern rock radio format this would be it...IMO.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|While the information is thorough and accurate, the presentation is novel. I enjoyed it, and obtained some new perspectives. I think this is well worth reading.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love Dexter! Its always 5 stars in my book! Can't wait for the new season to start! Looking forward to October!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I finally reached a new level of reading and complexity discovering this series. I was looking for something to follow-up the Harry Potters and Hunger Games...how can I go back to those now? I'm ruined...but for good!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I'm not one for typing when I could be reading... But let it suffice to say that I am gutted that this series is done. The only good thing about finishing this book is that my regular life can continue as planned. Thanks... It was a fabulous read
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF ALL THE SEX THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I READ ALL 3 BOOKS BECAUSE<br />OF THE STORY NOT BECAUSE OF THE SEX. IT DID HAVE A LOT OF SEX BUT NOTHING THAT WAS SO GROSS IT MADE YOU STOP READING THE BOOK.<br />THE STORY WAS SO TOUCHING I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND COULDN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE.
B002NVELDQ|5.0|I had heard from friends how great the series was, and they were right.<br /><br />I just watched the first season and ready to watch the second.<br /><br />Reminds me of growing up in the 60's.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|MISSED THIS SERIES ON TV, SO I ORDERED IT FOR THE KINDLE FIRE.  HAVE REALLY<br />ENJOYED THE SUSPENSE, INNER WORKING OF LAW OFFICES, GOOD AND BAD, PERFECT<br />CASTING FOR THE CHARACTERS.<br /><br />ENDED UP WITH ALL THREE SEASONS.
B003MQNENY|5.0|I think the endurance of this story lies in it's ability to paint a portrait with words. The surroundings, the characters, the plotlines are so vividly written, one can't help but be absorbed.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I gave this product 4 stars as opposed to 5 based solely on the movie itself, not the quality of the product.<br /><br />I love that this blu-ray copy of the movie comes with an e-version.  I was able to watch it thru amazon prime before the hard-copy arrived, which was great.<br /><br />In regard to the movie, it does a good job sticking to the book, but does omit a lot.  What they DID do, however, pretty much painted exactly the world I pictured while reading the book.  Overall, very happy with the movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|great movie but need to read all three books first than alot of the flashbacks and the quick pictures will make alot more sense and they will give the viewer more details on some of the scenes
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Nice Friday night movie.<br />Washnigton is good as always, Rayan is actauly pretty good too.<br />Could be a better movie, but entertaining to watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything about this part of the series is so unexpected!  Keep reading, I refuse to spoil anything with a review.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This is not what i wanted. I lost my $5, I'm angry. Do not buy it, it does not work very well on the kindle fire
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Definitely not as exciting as the first 2 books, but how can you only read two thirds of a series?  I'm definitely glad I read them all, this is a great story.
B008602KQI|4.0|Overall I did like the movie, I saw it in the theater and then bought. I did not read the books and with all the hype I wasn't sure how good the movie would be but, I actually liked the movie.  I only tend to purchase movies that I think I will watch over and over and this is one such movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|What fun!  Each level becomes more and more challenging with different obstacles to overcome.  My 7 year old daughter and I take turns playing the levels.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The only problem was that the book ended.  I hope to see more written by this author. I have all my friends reading it and now their friends are hooked.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Just as funny as the other movies were. I t was great to see the storylines tied up and see that chemistry between these once never heard of actors and actresses. Enjoyed it.
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|I did not expect this movie to be so enjoyable. The title is not attractive and I almost decided to pass it up...I am so glad I didn't! I have watched it several times now and have enjoyed it thoroughly each time. I highly recommend this quality film!!
1451627297|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but it has a dead spot in the middle, it is worth reading though.  I felt a little impatient with it and thought much like I feel about a lot of touchy feely things, just get on with it.  Kill that little SOB allready!<br /><br />On the good side good characters and plot.  Interesting time travel issues are dealt with in a clever way.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've seen SO many good, no excellent, reviews of this book.  Many of them are by friends of mine.  I had high hopes for this book after glancing through them on Goodreads.  I didn't read any of them in depth on there beforehand, I wanted to go in kind of \\"clean\\" about it.  You know what I mean.  So could the hype be true?  Could this book be that good?<br /><br />Um.  Hell yeah.<br /><br />The whole flow of the story was terrific, it very easily grabbed my attention and kept it.  In fact, I started reading this book about 8pm last night and didn't go to bed until 5am this morning.  I knew I wasn't going to get a chance to read much today, and I just had to know what was going to happen.  I could not put this book down.  And now I can't believe I have to wait until next year for book two - which happens to be told in Travis' point of view.  Brilliant move.  I only have one concern for that, aside from having to wait so long.  I worry that in Travis' point of view, it might just be too emotional.  I get ahead of myself here.<br /><br />First, Abby.  I didn't like Abby for most of the book.  There were definitely times where I felt she redeemed herself a bit.  But overall?  I found her to be a bit manipulative and immature.  There were instances where I thought she was a downright bitch.  But like I said, there were some redeeming scenes.  You know she feels these things for Travis, but the way she handles those feelings just left me with kind of a sour taste.<br /><br />Second, Travis.  He is amazing.  He starts off as this smart ass playboy, the bad boy that you know for a fact you have fallen for at least once in your life.  I know I have.  But he grows.  Travis teaches us that men can change, given the right reason.  And for him, that reason was Abby.  But right from the first moment they see each other you know he is in it for the long run.  I do wish he had been a little bit more forthcoming about his feelings for Abby, but that wouldn't made for much of a story haha.  He is a terrific guy who has a horrible temper, but for all the right reasons.  He makes some big mistakes, and I believe he overpaid for them.  Maybe I am being a little soft on him, I don't know.  I know that if I was Abby and I was confronted with the magnificent Travis, I wouldn't have ever given him up. Ever.  Never.  His passion for Abby is what made this book a five star read for me.<br /><br />Together, as a couple, they were perfect.  And that is when I liked Abby.  When she just let all of the outside world fall to the wayside and focused on what she felt for this wounded and beautiful man.  The passion and the emotions to back it up were there.  These two are definitely meant for each other.<br /><br />They also have some wonderful friends.  At times I wondered if they were too good, America in particular.  I wanted her to just stay the heck out of it, soemtimes.  But she was being a good friend, and that's what Abby needed.  There were also some less than savory characters.  All of them together made this story fantastic.<br /><br />This book will definitely pull on your emotions.  That's what kept me up til near dawn.  I fell in love with them as they fell in love with each other.  They are both very flawed, but together they are beautiful.  They belong together, most definitely.  There are some very high tension scenes, and some things that will just break your heart over and over.  I am so very glad I read this book.  The next year is going to be an eternity waiting for Travis' point of view!<br /><br />By the way, I love the cover.  I think the cover change from the open mouth to the butterfly in a jar was a wise decision.  This new cover is just beautiful and a bit tragic, it fits.haha.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The chapters alternate the perspective from the two main characters.  The use of this technique kept me quessing as to who the villian was. I was not hapy with the ending as I found it to be unbelievable.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am sure it would get 5 stars if I had not read all three books first... Watch the movie before you read the books.[[ASIN:1435709136 First Person: Combat PTSD]]
B000LBB4IA|5.0|The Ant Bully is a very cute film about kindness to all creatures, human or otherwise. It shows that team work can work better together than someone by themselves.  I loved this film!  There are some very great moments that make you ponder yourself, have I ever been so calious in thought to others when I was growing up? This movie can teach some very \\"valuable\\" information for young and old alike. I'm 58 years young and I can laugh out loud (lol) every time I see it.  If you have seen it, you know what I mean, if you haven't seen it yet, rent it and after that you will want to buy it, so you can play it whenever the kiddies come to visit.  Just think, a movie that teaches us not to bully, to live in harmony with everything big or small and to work as a team for the common good, and you know, you can't ask for anything more than that in a animated \\"Kids\\" movie. 5 stars
0307744434|2.0|I feel I need to add my 2 stars here to offset all the 5-star ratings, because the 5-star ratings influenced my purchase of the book, but I found the book disappointing and irritating.<br /><br />At first, the book was intriguing - very lush descriptions of magical scenes and supernatural events and characters with mysterious powers.  However, like so many reviewers have said, I kept waiting for the actual story to begin ... you know, plot and characters.  I agree with the reviewer who said that this would make a great movie - there are some awesome, beautiful \\"special effects\\" described here.  While there are hints at a romantic plot (or even subplot), that never really develops.  Characters appear so 1-dimensional that I expected to find out that they were conjured up rather than real people.  I did manage to finish it, but admit to skimming more and more as I got closer to the end.  For the first 300 pages, I kept thinking it would all lead somewhere, but it never seemed to go anywhere at all.  Just more \\"special effects\\" without much of a story tying it together.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can't put it down!  Very good book. Very well written.  It has been a long time since I have read a book that has kept me this interested.  [[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]]
B0031RDUX8|5.0|Great book, pageturner, constant action and unexpected turn of events. After finishing this one you REALLY want to get hold of the next one asap.Also very informative in regards to old figures of legends, old gods-well researched. 5 stars!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Purchased the movie as a pre-order from Amazon - it was delivered very quickly after the release date.  I was able to stream it at no extra cost as an instant video from Amazon.com prior to the actual arrival of the DVD.  Good action movie - theme similar to \\"The Running Man\\"
B008CP93S0|4.0|If you are a fan of Paul Rudd and movies like \\"role models\\" and \\"I love you, man\\" you will like this.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times and it never gets old, Brad Pitt's performance is stellar to say the least - one of my all time favorite movies!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|John Steinbeck is a an artist who painted with prose.  Grapes of Wrath was my favorite book for decades.  I have read and reread it over the years, but I had forgotten about Of Mice and Men which I had read years ago in college.  While browsing for some reading material in my Kindle, I ran across the title.  I ordered it and was rewarded with a wonderful tale of hardship, compassion, and tragedy set in one of the most trying periods of our countries history.  It was more novella than a book.  Easily read in a few hours.  It describes the strugles of two drifters seeking a piece of the American dream.  One man, the leader, is bright and resourceful, the other is mentally challenged, but loved and cared for by his partner. The conclusion is classically Kane and Able.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun and relaxing! Easy to play with pretty screens and soothing music. A very zen game. Good for all ages.

B001LM1456|5.0|Order came on time, movie was awesome, a little dissapointing that the actors were not the same as in the Hulk
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The story line was beautiful for the first 3/4 of the book.  The saga continued well, but the story jumped around towards the end like the writer was rushed and the ending was horrible, I hope there is a fourth book delving into the Happy ever after life and bedroom savvy of the married couple.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not stopped reading since I bought it. Amazon you are doing it right! I recommend this book and saga to anyone.

B00846TRHY|5.0|Gerard Butler is outstanding. You will hate him in the first 20 minutes and grow to admire him the rest of the movie. Surreal performance!!! Excellent movie!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved reading this book! Good perspectives and different voices from the author. Very cool. I highly recommend this for a vacation read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did like the suspence. I didn't like the ending. I would have ended by him walking away and her having a bi-racial child. I would have had the sperm samples mixed up and him notified about it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like many features of this app, including the small daily verse widget and reading plans. when you haven't opened it in awhile, it gives you a gentle and encouraging suggestion. Try this app, you'll like it!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Great story! Good lesson for the kiddos. I am in love with all the vibrant colors and beautiful animation. This is a movie you could watch over and over again.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Omgh!!! This was the first Nicholas Spark's book I have read and I have to say even though it was sad I loved it. He puts so much detail into the book making me fell like I'm right there with Savannah, Tim, John, and the dad. This book is about John who is in the military and he comes home on leave and meets this girl named Savannah. Their relationship was doing just fine till 9/11 and that's when it started going down hill. It is also about John's relationship with his dad and how different his dad is but still he is the perfect dad for John.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great book, for someone who does not like to read I could not put the book down. I would def recommend people to read it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a perfect way to pass the time. I bought it because of the low price but continued reading because of the thrills! It has more style and substance than your average cheesy romance novel. Finally, a book I can relate to!
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Star Trek IV is one of the best - if not the best - of the Star Trek movies with the original cast.  It's all there - a plausible plot, the suspense, the technology, the humor.<br /><br />Most of the humor - what I most enjoy about the movie - is subtle:<br /><br />  \\"Don't forget where we parked.\\"<br />  \\"How do you know Gracie is pregnant?/She told me.\\"<br />  \\"I'm from Iowa; I just work in outer space.\\"<br /><br /> It trades on the crew members being out of place and out of time.<br /><br />There's never any doubt Our Heroes will save the day.  It's how they do it that keeps your attention.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|So if you have read the Name of the Wind and you are currently wondering whether you should go grab the sequel, I can only urge you to buy it immediately. At its core it is a great story, managing to draw you in and keep you immersed in the story.<br />This is despite there not actually being much story. The overarching plot is barely mentioned as Kvothe instead spends his time going on various barely-connected, although highly entertaining, adventures.<br />Despite being detailed and long there is something reminiscent of a spoken rather than a written narrative in the way the story is told. This is on one hand a great strength as it ties into the framing story of Kvothe chronicling his life, but the story also loses a bit of its impact as you feel like you are experiencing Kvothe's memories rather than his first-hand experiences. This is a particular issue (in my personal opinion) with the secondary characters who seem well fleshed-out, but never really come into their own.<br />Despite these minor gripes there are many things to love about this book -from the amazing way magic is handled, over his exquisitely detailed and personal narration of everything from music to martial arts, to his general inventiveness - and I'll still heartily recommend it.
B008EQIA7W|3.0|The first movie was better, the story line was put in place just to make a another movie, was not that great.

B008M34INW|1.0|I like Mel Gibson and normally enjoy his movies.  I bought \\"Get the Gringo\\" after seeing a reference to it that I thought was interesting.<br /><br />Movie is terrible.  Language awful, dialog is in Spanish with English subtitles but the subtitles are not on the screen long enough to read and the print it much too small.<br /><br />Probably the worse investment in entertainment that I have made.<br />John<br />Charlotte, NC
1577314808|1.0|For those giving this book a poor rating, what I can say is you're not wrong but not right either. Because without certain degree of understanding of our being (not physical, but mental and spiritual), this book won't strike a chord!
B008602KQI|5.0|Am very happy with my DVD!YAY! Just one question!! What happened to the soundtrack in the beginning??? The opening through the reaping was totally changed!!!! That's the only thing I could find fault with!
1452101426|4.0|Not as good as the Tarzan one that came out many years ago, but comes real close.<br />It really goes into the development of the movie, and shows us the work that goes into creating the artwork involved.<br />Thanks for the book and movie.

B006LSZECO|3.0|an entertaining read,sometimes quite humorous but the ending was so over the top that I couldn't suspend belief.  However, it was inventive and given the repetitive plots that glut the market,<br />this was refreshing.  There was something about the main character that was hollow and unlikeable.  The gone girl was really psychopathic and One can't imagine living in the same house with<br />her let alone sleeping in the same bed.
B006M6NUBC|5.0|Terrific cast assembly and awesome action. Perfect combination of humor and action. I hope Stallone makes many many more of these gems! Keep 'em comin'.

Carrying on the tradition established by, amongst others, Jeremy Bentham, the book is a largely successful and thought-provoking attempt to analyse criminal law in utilitarian and economic terms.<br /><br />Fundamentally the book offers up a number of economic analyses of criminal law -- and therefore encompasses the social sciences, including economics, behavioural economics, psychology and, to some extent, sociology.  Those interested in criminology too, should also read this book.<br /><br />To put it fairly simply: what does crime cost?  And what does it cost -- and what might it cost -- to put in place sanctions and other deterrents which would lead to a decrease in crime? The possible and sometimes theoretical answers to these and a host of related questions are the stuff of the often very rigorous academic research and analysis to be found in this book.<br /><br />The work is a collection of articles, not gleaned from specialist publications, but original and specially commissioned.  Each article reveals a differing, but methodical approach to exploring the ways and means by which economics can enhance the way we understand the development of criminal law.<br /><br />The learned contributors are based mainly at American universities and the orientation is certainly American, but in view of the subject matter, which is crime and criminals, this probably matters little. Criminality, especially in developed societies, is a global problem.<br /><br />In their introduction, the editors draw a distinction between `the retributive tradition' (of criminal law sanctions)...and economic analysis, which considers the most effective measures for dealing with, mainly, future behaviour, which centres on deterrence and prevention.<br /><br />They stress that criminal law sanctions should be used only when they reduce the costs of crime and anti-social behaviour, including both the direct costs of crime and the costs of crime prevention measures.<br /><br />Enhanced by illustrative diagrams and tables (including some detailing the relationship between mobile phones and crime rates!), plus detailed reading lists at the end of each chapter, this book is an interesting and instructive read, certainly for criminal lawyers, as well as criminologists, sociologists and those making difficult policy decisions with respect to crime prevention and punishment.

B0011Z76RS|5.0|Hybrid Theory is a must album for any Linkin Park fan and a great addition to any music library. The My December \\"Special Edition\\" track is a must have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book and the movie was good as well.  Easy to read even on my phone.  A real page turner.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting for this app. I love Pinterest and love being able to do this on my Kindle Fire. There are some glitches every once in awhile, but over all it is great.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Wild.  The writer is funny, honest, articulate and self deprecating.  You don't have to be an outdoorsman/woman to appreciate the challenges the writer faced while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  The author did a great job of weaving her personal struggles into the story. As someone who has recently lost my mother, I particularly connected to the author's loss of her mother and her unraveling in the years that followed.  The author described the obstacles she confronted along the trail and the ways she found of circumventing them.  Each tangent seemed to take her closer to finding herself again, even while at times the challenges seemed insurmountable. By book's end the reader understands why the author took on the PCT, and why when she reached the end of the trail she had \\"found\\" herself. I was inspired to find my own journey to deal with personal struggles.  Read it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting reading to say the least. Book 2 Chapter 1, time will only tell how interesting this one is going to be!!!
B0071MQBX0|3.0|The spectacle for the taping of The Phantom of the Opera is visually great, however Karim Raminloo, although he shows his effort and stron performance, his tendency to make a hissing sound between breaths can be a minor distraction/annoyance.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This book made me a fan of Daniel Suarez. The technical aspects of this book are very accurate and the characters are memorable and real. If you are considering reading this book don't think twice. I could not put it down. I have also read Freedom tm and Kill Decision and they are excellent novels.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Like all Nicholas Sparks books he gets you interested right from the start and holds you there throughout the entire book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the YouVision to supplement my regular Biblle.  I can easily look up several versions of a scripture.<br /><br />I also can listen to the audio available in many versions.  Sometimes I listen to the Bible as I go to sleep<br /><br />There also many handy helps.  I tried another app and this one is much better.<br /><br />Thank you creators for an excellent job.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Nice to see more spunky little girl characters in kid's movies. This has a lot of action and some peril, but is full of hilarious dialogue and wonderful little minions that make this thoroughly entertaining for kids and adults too. I think it's probably best for ages 5 and up.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|From seeing a few videos of Gary at TED and elsewhere, I had a bit of an idea what this would be like - and I wasn't disappointed.  Well, maybe just a bit because when he's being real he's cursing and I guess they wouldn't let him do that on the audiobook.<br /><br />I love how he goes \\"off topic for a minute\\" because to me, that's real.  He'll be reading and then an idea comes to him and he veers off to clarify something.  You don't get that reading a book and you don't get that on any other audio books either.<br /><br />Love it!<br /><br />Jeff
B008XG1X18|3.0|title says it all. it crashes frequently and sometimes I even have to restart my Kindle.  I do continue to use however.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl Proves you never fully know anyone<br /><br />Interesting  start,  becomes terrific  mystery which surprises reader continuously . Twists and turns in personalities and actions of two main characters holds readers interest and makes book impossible to put down. The interacting characters are also on target  and play very realistic roles in affecting the reader and the main characters.. Unfortunately once the surprises are finished author struggles with how to bring book to a conclusion and last 15% of book seemed off kilter. Incident with old boy friend tough to swallow. This disappointing conclusion  led me to 4 star rather than 5 star rating.<br /><br />H Pines
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I got my kindle fire for my birthday in april and I have been really wishing there was a way to make notes, the office app on here isnt useful for that.  I came across this app and YAY!  it is Perfect for me!! I can keep track of multiple notebooks...ie. different books for different catagories, they can be converted to PDF form to print, the layout is nice and it has some good features, drawing tablet, bookmark, etc.  So far I havent found anything I dont like, although I've only had it about a month.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book! It is one of the most original, thought provoking books I have read in awhile. Stephen King books are usually not on my favorite lists, however, this one blew me away. Well written, expertly researched and a fantastic plot. The character's are easy to like and the story is unforgettable. I strongly recommend this book. As usual the book is long, but, not long enough for me. I was so involved in this plot that I couldn't wait to finish my daily requirements, so I could get back into it. I am not going to give away any spoilers. I encourage anyone who is looking for something better than most of the best sellers to check this book out. Wonderful job, Mr. King.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This whole series was great...just when I thought it was getting a little some new plot would arise and back into the story I went.
B008602KQI|4.0|I think they did a good job on the movie!  The book should be read prior to seeing it as the book does fill in some of the blanks, and does a much better job of character development, and that is important in this book as it is very much about the characters and how they became who they are.
B001D09OAI|4.0|I watch this film at least once during each baseball season. I'm not an Indians fan. I simply love baseball, and as a fan, I appreciate many of the jokes. Also, as a sports writer for over a decade, there are some \\"inside baseball\\" jokes that have an amazing shelf life.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|It is a rare occassion that I can refer to a piece of literature as life changing but it is indeed how I would describe Eating Animals.  The author takes great care to thoroughly investigate all aspects of the meat and dairy industry and relay what he has found.  It is not a one-sided representation at all, since the author gives perspectives from all sides of the issue including those working within the factory farm industry, family farmers, and animal activists alike.  There are chapters that are very difficult to read due to the everyday horrors involved in the factory farm industry.  That said, for anyone who wishes to be well informed on these issues and truly understand the toll this industry is taking on the environment, the animals and our own health, it is an must read. I cannot recommend this book enough!!  Do yourself a favor and purchase it now!
B0029Z0QZ8|5.0|Sam just accidentally started the fricking apacolypse (sorry for spelling) he's high on demon blood and his an deans relationship is almost tetering on the side of a bridge oh and lucifer Saitan is loose who wouldn't want to see that so watch it it's worth it
B008MEM24S|4.0|terrific puzzler with a physics based twist. use water in all its States (liqid vapor.and ice) to solve each level.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really liked the sex scenes and the story itself.  However, It would have been more believable if the couple were a little older.  I'm trying to get my husband to read the books too!
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I have not read a thriller in years. This one I could not put down! Loved the character of Christine, and the involved plot.<br />Highly recommended for Book Clubs- lots to discuss.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really love this game. I have downloaded it on my Coby tablet and it works great. There are annoying ads that pop up after every game. Other than that, the ap is great.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books before I watched the movie, and I would recommend this as well.  You won't feel lost if you don't read the books, but they do help fill in the gaps and give a little more background.  As for the movie itself, I really enjoy it and I found it to be a movie that I want to watch over and over!
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's exciting. Game play is always simple to under stand. Even young kids love to play it,  it helps them to learn to count.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Overall okay. Not sure if adolescent duel to the death was my cup of tea. My 12 year old cannot watch it enough times. I felt it was a bit of an adult theme for her age. Although she did read the first two books. Was not overtly violent and that was a good thing. Let's hope the second installment will be better.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 10 yr old son absolutely LOVES this game.  Ever since I got it for him, he wants to play it with his friends all the time.<br />I love it because he's having fun and it DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY VIOLENCE.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|this was a put down come back when ever book ... pretty woman with sex explained way too much ...last book was the best ...it added a little more story line. did not get all the talk .. people need to get a life.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Worth the buy, nice songs to listen to. Even though I feel the music feels different from the last album, I thought they would collab with other artists (like Aguilera or Rihanna) but that's alright. They did a good job.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, I should say \\"sob\\" and in some parts I could be heard sayihng OMG!!!!  I really hated to come to the end of the book, but good ending.
B002ECQQZU|4.0|This remake takes you in the mind of a psychopath and what length parents go to to save their child.<br />A real chiller!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first one - which leaves you hanging at the end so you will get book two - you will surely like book two.
B008602KQI|5.0|This book and the triogy are one of the most captivating stories ever written. Katniss is an awesome protagonist. The plot is balanced, the timing impecable.
B008KNZ4LO|4.0|It was a great movie, just wish it was in english.<br />It had a lot of action and the story line was great.  overall I it 4 stars
B00338QENI|5.0|well written, page turner, alternates nicely between the scientific/medical history of Henrietta's cells and the history/emotions of her and her family.  Well researched, flows well, great read
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love Criminal Minds and Season 6 is a great addition to their other Seasons. I didn't start watching till the 4th season, but have now seen all the episodes from each season thru TV or DVD. So I am glad to have the 6th season to have to my collection.
B008EQIK90|4.0|This movie was very [silly] funny.  I remember watching the original series and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to get the original actors to have cameos in one way or another. I will not give spoilers, however, if you're a fan of the original show this was a good watch.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a very well thoughtout novel. Maybe too well...about 3/4 of the way through, I was checking out. There's no way all the details involved could have ever happened in a real world. I just found it unbelievable and over the top.
0525953728|5.0|My review is not so much on this book but on others reviews.  How is it ok that others are allowed to publish books(Lone Survivor, Roberts Ridge, Red Cell, Fearless and the 10 other books you can find on a shelf regarding this community), make Hollywood movies sponsored by the Navy and NSW (Act of Valor), do articles for magazines and interviews on TV and Radio with no recourse.  As soon as a member comes out with a first hand account it is considered from this community as Treason?  How can any member of the military not be furious with a President that takes full credit for what it has taken these men years to accomplish when he did not serve one day in any branch of the Armed Service.  Where is the trial for the White House Staffer that leaked information to the press, about the mission?  How about the SEAL Officers that talk of humility then sponsor a movie? I enjoyed this book.  I just think its funny that all of a sudden the SEAL community is trying to be the quite, humble, guy in the corner that is tight lipped, and Owen is at fault for dragging this community into the spot light and exposing everything endangering their lives.....ya right, they did it to themselves but just blaming him.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  The acting is great and the storyline never gets borind. :)
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|First half of book is very slow -  blisters and plasters ad nauseum.  Not until the latter part is there any insight to the sterile relationship between him and his wife and a hint of why he feels so obligated to complete his journey.  Then everything falls into place very quickly. In fact the ending is rather abrupt leaving their future relationship to the reader's hopes.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Like the rest of the world I wondered what the fuss was and bought these books. It was a terrible mistake. The books are dreadful and it is tragic how titles such as this can sell in the millions yet other more worthy reads struggle to make any headway. Do not waste your time or precious heart beats.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great app. I check it every day and it's usually pretty accurate. I check weather conditions in other states where family and friends live, too. It gives all sorts of information besides the temperature. Fun to use! You won't be disappointed if you get it.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you liked Fifty Shades you will probably like this book.  I found it to be very similar story line.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Do not waste your time. Really disappointed. I really do not know what all the hype was about. Maybe it's just me.
B007SGM084|5.0|All I can say is \\"this is the best love story I have ever read\\".  You just need to continue reading, don't stop after a few pages.  It gets better the more you read.  Can't wait for the 4th book.  I just wanted to add this to my review, I am going to read them again for the 2nd time.<br />Laters Baby<br />Virginia
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this for my daughter early so we could get it the day of release.<br />She loves it, and loves the extras it comes with.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is great.  Long but great.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes adventure/drama.  Very good supporting actors.
B007SGM084|4.0|I didn't know what I was getting myself into as I started reading the trology. It kept popping up everywhere, so in the end curiousity got the better of me. It is not something I would have picked - had I known. But poor me if I hadn't read it. 50 shades is not likely to win any great prizes, but who cares?
B008VBYN80|5.0|So far this has been an entertaining game. It's along the same lines as &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; only better in my opinion. So far I have made it only to level 14 and I have not had to spend any real money to play. I have never actually paid any money to buy points in any game but this is a really good one and is tempting to try it. Runs well for me on Kindle Fire, has not crashed or lagged at all. Well done Gameloft!
B007MU85D0|5.0|My Head Is An Animal is a fantastic album.  Each track captures and accentuates the talent and passion of every member of Of Monsters and Men, and I absolutely cannot get enough of it.  I'm very much looking forward to seeing these guys (and gal) live, but, until then, I will sate my taste for good music with this great album!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  The only bad thing about it is that I spend way too much time on the site.  It's my favorite website!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what the book was about. I was really quite surprised! I deffinately did not want to put it down, always wanting to know what would happen next. I understand a lot of people are letting younger children read it. That really surprised me. I would highly recommend you read it yourself before you let your child read it, not sure if it is a good idea.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the five books and want more!<br />Each book has a great ending that leaves you itching for reading the next one. Very good writing and character development
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I have ALWAYS loved the songs on this particular Carole King album (Tapestry).  Originally I bought it on vinyl (back in the 70's).  Since then I've had the cassette tape and on CD.  It is just perfect for my MP3 player and I have enjoyed having it back in my life once again.<br /><br />Amazon.com is a wonderful source or music of all genres and in all formats.  I recommend Amazon to all music buffs, as well as other media services.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Like the four books before, GR Martin weaves an exciting tale coloured by its medieval/fantasy setting and great characters.  In any case, once you've started this epic story in Book 1, it's impossible to stop.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great reading right from the start.  All ready on the second book and can't wait for the third to be released!!!
B008CPBB0I|5.0|My family rented this film on a whim, but we really enjoyed it.  The cast was fantastic and the story was portrayed so magnificently.  I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Don't make any plans, don't answer the phone - you will not be able to put this book down! Superbly crafted story, at times, very funny (in the blackest way), with characters that manipulate and have power over each other and you. You are part of the roller-coaster ride and you won't want it to stop. I have loved ALL Gillian Flynn's books, but this may be her very best yet. I am deeply envious that you have this treat ahead of you. Enjoy!
B00846REIS|4.0|I wasn't sure if this was going to be just another \\"50 Shades\\" but gave it a shot anyway.  Surprisingly, I liked it a lot better than the \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy! The main characters have a more grown-up personality, but there were similarities...like the fact that Gideon is a billionaire with control issues.  Eva has past issues of her own that lead to many mishaps with Gideon. It was a good read, and I look forward to the next book as it doesn't end with this one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like this app. Very relaxing. Very nice. I highly recommend it. A lot of sounds and melodies to choose from. Whether using it to relax or sleep, there is a combination of sounds you will love. Settings and use are great and easy. Highly recommended.
B0028INIWE|1.0|Downloads are not compatable with iTunes ? Must buy the \\"Amazon Cloud Download\\". Customer service consists of confusing emails. Buy at your own risk. Prices are great but you get what you pay for. I will not purchase in the future.
B008OOYALE|4.0|please add katkat987654321 the game is fun to play but like most team lava games it can take a long time to complete tasks
B002PE0HCU|5.0|Looks great in H.D.! The scene when the birds first attack looks fantastic! Also the sound track and bird effects were great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the hunger games books were fantastic! The books just get better and better! I was sad to see it end but I hope the author comes out with a new series of books soon!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved book series. I thought the film adaptation was very good. I liked all the actor choices for these special character. Katniss' Jennifer Lawrence excellent. Peeta's was my least favorite but ok. Several people I know who didn't read the books found this dystopian world story making kids fight to the death too disturbing.<br />My son & I loved it.
B007SGM084|5.0|A lot of sexual content, very explicit.. Definitely not for the faint of heart.. Over all, by the end of the 3rd book I got a bit bored with all the sex, but the story very good.
B0054TKB8I|5.0|THis is a fun show that I got hooked on because the storyline is extremely compelling.  It's faced paced and I never guessed what was going to happen next.  I only watched the first episode for a lark--I am not a teenager--and ended up just loving the show.  Lots of sex appeal for females as well as gay men, which is a nice change of pace.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter got me to read the books before the movie came out. I was only going to read the first book but got wrapped up in the story and read all three. The movie is very well done. Now we can't wait for the next one Catching Fire.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My first ever review - despite buying over 2300 DVD's and blu-rays from Amazon...<br /><br />When I first bought the 1-disk blu-ray and watched it on my 73\\" Mitsu DLP, I had to watch it again back-to-back! It was SO beautifully made, with so much imagination going into Cameron's production design. It all worked together - the Na'Vi, the flora and fauna of this strange world, the floating mountains, the plants lighting up when touched,the sheer beauty was stunning. The mountains - floating and otherwise - streams reminded me of a Roger Dean Yes album (big vinyl CD, played with a needle) cover, and the Na'vi warriors - particularly the women - reminded me of Boris Vallejo drawings. I can forgive the 2D characters. Rabisi is a GREAT sleazy middle manager type, Selfrige is set as strutting badass who loves killing more than his own life...<br /><br />I already own the 3-disk extended blu-ray and a Chinese import 3D theatrical cut - after seeing the 3D on HBO on-demand I had to have the disk, so I paid $66 on ebay.<br /><br />I've since bought a 65\\" Samsung 3D, after my Mitsu died, and - even at this smaller size -  the 3D makes a big difference.<br /><br />I will buy the new extended cut 3D, since I like the added footage, and love the 3D.<br /><br />Cons: Unobtanium - REALLY? He couldn't come up with a better name?  VERY hokey-sounding!<br />Should have had the hookup via their tails, not braids - just too many questions: haircuts? can only wear a single braid, are they born with the braid?
B0041D843M|5.0|Great book. If you needed a reason to eat better or go all the way (and become vegan) this might be your impetus. Provides valid reasons and research. Would love to hand this book out to everyone I know.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Being retired I found this a thoughtful book as Harold reviews his life's ups and downs.  As his walk rpogresses you learn about his life, family and marriage.  Also his wife's thoughts of him begin to change.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a cute game that has the typical addicting qualities any farming / care giving game has to offer. The animations, art, and UI are decent & they don't hound you to purchase in-game items which is nice. The only thing that is frustrating is that the \\"goals\\" are not yet offered on the kindle fire edition, but are offered for iOS and android.  I noticed that the Team Lava dev team posted a little less than a month ago on 8/8/12 on their forums that they were currently working on the kindle fire version of the goals.  Not sure how long it takes to reconfigure the same code from android to kindle fire devices, but I know that they both use the Android SDK.  Hopefully they will roll out a new version for the fire soon, with the goals intact.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I started the trilogy I was not sure I would be able to read the first one completly but once I started I loved it. I stayed up the whole night reading the first one then just continued with the trilogy awesome. Cant wait to read more...
B005D63ICI|5.0|New Dexter fan, here...my husband & I have just consumed all the seasons in about a month. Amazing stuff...this season is my favorite. Julia Stiles' character is awesome & I love the dynamic between her & Dexter. I was unsure how I would like it after what happened in the Season 4 finale but they did good! Really, really good. Now I'm gonna have to get Showtime because I just don't think I can do without Dex!!
0743243153|4.0|The book is simply amazing and opens my eyes to the truth around me.  I have had troubles putting it down.  A definite must read!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Movie was in great condition and very good movie, I watched this in the theater and again after receiving it, my teenage granddaughters and I watched it (2 x for me & once for them), enjoyed it.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|So glad to have purchased this music.  I am at least 20 years older than most of the members of this band and it took me back to better times.  Well, not exactly - it was more like the older in me and the younger in me catapulted together towards a blissful horizon where man balances woman, woman beckons man to merge a union of power that controls the better part of our universe.  Florence's voice is fantastic, and the backup singers have the intuition to reform her solitary into a balances symphony of sound.  The celtic hints take us back to calmer times and leads us to believe that our future is in our hands.  Refreshing and Inspiring.
B004J88SGC|5.0|The Billy Joel concert at Shea Stadium was filled with great music and surprised guest.  Billy Joel is a wonderful artist.  The songs and guest bring back lots of good memories.
B008CPBB0I|5.0|This movie was a nice family movie.  It was based on a true story so enjoyed learning about what happened and how people worked together to save the whales involved.
B0013ND36G|5.0|This one arrived on time and in great condition, but when I saw it after viewing the actual movie some years ago, I realized the screenplay of T-3 was radically different from the final movie version! Wish someday, they'd redo it with the original T-3 screenplay version.
B005898CFI|5.0|This was one of the \\"Duke's\\" best movies, in my opinion.  I loved the animal footage and interaction, now they use trained animals and \\"cartooned\\" animals.  My favorite scene was when the cheetah wandered into the bathroom and Red Buttons comes to the \\"rescue\\" !! LOL
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I was born in 1950 and remember the rise, fall and rise again of Jobs and Apple. To finally read the full story has made this one of the most intriguing books I have read in a long time. I am an avid I-device user and reading about the development of these products has made me really appreciate the genius of Steve Jobs.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|At first I couldnt put it down. About 80 pages til the end it got very predictable. I skimmed the rest.....
B008ASLNN2|3.0|Could have been a bad day, but this was not nearly as interesting as the first one.  The special effects were great though.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|i was expecting to see a light-hearted Romantic Comedy but instead this was the Worst Dramedy I have seen in years. It was painful to watch the actors struggle with this poor script and bad characterization. this movie was advertised as a comedy but frankly as a divorce I found it all too depressingly real. No escape from the daily troubles here, you will find yourself wishing someone would violently murder the main characters or a plane drops on your house just to keep one from having to  finish the movie.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I must say that I didn't like Fifty shades of Grey, and I only read the second becouse I wanted to understand why so many millions of people are reading the trilogy. said that, Fifty Shades darker, at least has a story to tell, and the book is more that just pornography as it explains why Grey is Grey... I think that it's a book to read during the summer while you are sunbathing (!)...  don't look for literature.. just read and relax!
B001URVSPS|4.0|John Legend embodies swagger and he's just so smooth when he sings. I was late to the game in finally picking up some of his music but I just love it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was hooked almost immediately.  At first blush, 11/22/63 appears to be a journey into the supernatural.  But, while time travel and the implications of the so-called \\"butterfly effect\\" are always in the background, King's protagonist,  Jake Epping/George Amberson,  has universal appeal.  King made me feel like I, too, was experiencing life in the late 50's/early 60's, and I didn't want to go back down the rabbit hole to 2011 any more than Jake did.  I haven't read King in years, and I've missed him.  Great read, you won't be disappointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this almost as much as 50 Shades!!! It was a lot like the Fifty Shades of Grey.. Would really like to see a lot more books like these ones. I can't wait for the second book to come out on October 2. Already pre ordered it!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Excellent movie!  We are fans of the series, and this film was satisfyingly close to the book.  It was also well cast; Jennifer Lawrence is a perfect Katniss.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Such a fun and energetic movie!  Loved the music and dancing!  Very lighthearted!  Fun for the whole family, everyone would enjoy it!
B008ASLNN2|4.0|In many ways, rather than a storyline, \\"Shadows\\" is more a series of set pieces that answer the question, \\"As a fan of Holmes, what awkward and action extremes would you like to see Holmes go through?\\" Thus, there are male-bonding extremes, disguised cross-dressing extremes, hand-to-hand combat extremes, and many 19th-Century-characters-versus-20th-Century-warfare-technology extremes; but with Downey's cynical but sentimental Holmes and Law's baffled but steadfast Watson, they actually pull off a very non-Holmesian plotline. Of special note are the multitude of Computer Generated effects that make turn-of-the-Century Europe and exploding trees equally believable. Lots of clever fun.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book has been such a calming, helpful book that will help you realize the importance of life. It is a great easy reading book that I enjoyed immensely. When I got to the end I wanted to read it over again!

B008602KQI|4.0|I actually give this film 4.5-stars. While book to motion picture films are rarely as good or comparable to the original story in the book, I actually felt this film did the book justice. It's a longer motion picture (close to two and a half hours in length), but the pace of the story keeps you riveted to your seat in a way that one doesn't really notice the time passing. Also the cinematography, make-up, and special effects combine to make this film a stunning visual adaptation of the story. And it doesn't hurt that the film's execs made wise choices for the actors who portray the characters. Donald Sutherland always seems in top form, as does Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson, just to name a few. This DVD covers the first book in the trilogy and I'm already looking forward to the film adaptations for the next two books. This movie is worth seeing even if one doesn't want to add it to their DVD movie collection. [[ASIN:B0092G1O8A The Hunger Games]]
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am only about 50% finished with this book, but so far I am enjoying the articles and would definitely recommend it.  It is inspiring me to do more to declutter my home and my life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Reading Gone Girl is like strapping yourself into a roller coaster.  The ride starts our slowly, building questions in your mind, as you learn about the characters and their history.  About half way through the roller coaster starts making twists and turns and you won't want to get off until you come to the end. Although this novel is a psychological thriller, it is very well written, smart, and modern. The themes of love, truth, and whether we can ever really know another person, make it so much more than just a thriller. It will keep you guessing.  I read Gone Girl over a 3 day period when it was raining.  I didn't miss being outside at all!
B00846REIS|5.0|Its steamy and romantic and I was addicted from the beginning. If you love aggressive romantic books your gonna love this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not book the book down. I love a book when you just want to keep turning the page.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great movie! Zac is an awesome actor and this movie shows that. I loved how it didn't look fake and mashed together but very well made. I also loved the little kid! He was so cute and his little violin! It was great watching how the characters changed through the story and you could see the change happen instead of wondering what just happened to that person?! It was a very cute movie and i would recommend it to anyone pre-teen and up^<br /><br />  ***Heather (16)***

B004Q0SQ24|5.0|\\"Wilson\\" was received into the railway yard with great enthusiasm. Especially love the smiling faces, durability, and size of the Chuggington series. They even fit on his Daddy's old Brio track, so all of the antique accessories work well with the exception of the height of each car being taller than the Brio cars. This does make each car easier to hold onto and maneuver with little hands. We just set up the lower tunnel on another track just for Brios. Makes for hours and hours of entertainment and fun.

B0082SU98U|5.0|The story made famous by Hayley Mills (Disney's 1960 version), is even more charming in it's original book form. Pollyanna has been brought up to find something to be \\"glad\\" about in every situation. Finding herself orphaned and sent to live with a stern aunt, does not dampen Pollyanna's optimism. Soon she has befriended many people in her new town and taught them to play the \\"glad game,\\" which brings humorous & endearing results. However, when Pollyanna is involved in a tragic accident, she finds that she can no longer play the game. Will she ever be glad again? You will find the ending to the story most inspiring, as old enemies finally forgive, wedding bells ring for the \\"old-maid,\\" an orphan boy finds a real home, an ornery invalid learns to smile, and Pollyanna herself learns to be glad again! Recommended for children ages 5 and up...although, I really enjoyed reading it as an adult too. My husband and I are playing the \\"glad game\\" now.
B007SGM084|4.0|I admit it, I liked it. But I'm aware it's a total chick flick, it has everything a girl would like, a damage stupidly handsome billionaire that would leave anything he´s doing to be with the girl...and she fixes him! I read the 3 books in like a week, but if you are looking for a serious masterpiece this is not for you. If you want to have fun and get yourself into a modern fairy tail (for adults) this is your book.
B007BS13UA|5.0|I've been a a Bonnie Rait fan for a long time so I was curious to,see if her latest effort would compare favorably with her earlier work.  Slipstream could easily become my new favorite!  Highly recommended!
0515149489|1.0|this book is downright boring and such a disappointment for a nora roberts fan.  Way too much detail about the dogs, and the relationship, not too much going on with the suspense/thriller part of the story at all.  When does the action start?  I am listening to the audio book, I'm on #10 of 13 and still NO action to speak of.  And on top of that...there are two different CD's where the book is repeated!  I thought I was either be crazy or I have ESP!  Obiviouly a recording error...but c'mon...the is Nora Roberts and that alone should make proof-\\"listening\\" a MUST!  My advice...don't waste your time.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is an outstanding novel, quite possibly King's best work.  I have read nearly everything he has written and this is truly a standout masterpiece.  King has written some clunkers, like many I think he seemed to sink into a period of mediocrity in the middle part of his writing career.  Lately I think he has found new life and his last few books have been good to very good.  I don't always like to shell out a ton of money on e-books.  There are a rare few e-books that I will pay $13.00 for.  This is one.  This book will appeal to many people who would never consider King.  It is much more of a literary novel with amazingly deep characters.  King transports you to the 1960's....who knew how different that time truly is when compared to 2011.  The pacing of the novel, as we get closer and closer to the assassination date, is a like a runaway train and you can't get off.  Lots of little references to his other works as per usual for the die hard fans.  My mom loved it and this was her first Stephen King book at age 66. Buy it. Love it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I love the maze runner series! They are mysterious and humorous. I'm just about to get the prequel book! I would reccomend this book to every age.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This one goes back a few years to 2003 and was Joe's 3rd album.<br /><br />At present, Joe is only in his mid thirties and has been touring and performing for over 20 years. Most veterans would love to to have the resume that this young man presently enjoys. Imagine 20 years from now when Joe is in his 50's. At the pace he is going, he should have over 30 albums to his credit by then, and I'm being conservative.<br /><br />This album, in my opinion features Joe at his best even though it is an early work. He covers numerous classics while adding a few of his own. He seems to be possessed by his predecessors, feeling what they felt when they created these timeless masterpieces. Joe definitely does justice to everything he produces. His voice only gets better with every new album.<br /><br />I can only compare his work ethic to one of the greats, John Mayall, who tirelessly contributes over and over to the music business past and present and whose career spans over 50 years.<br /><br />The man has soul, is extremely gifted and genuine, and is definitely the future of blues and rock and roll.<br /><br />Keep the train rollin' Joe.

B000Q79HS8|4.0|This is no doubt a great movie out of the Bourne trilogy.<br />I was glad that I found Amazon carries this title while Netflix does not.<br />Yet the streaming quality is not as good as Netflix, and, although it might not be everyone's interest, it has no subtitles option.<br /><br />It definitely has room for improvement, and I am definitely looking forward to it.
055357342X|5.0|The song of Ice and Fire continues to play as the conflict through Westeros takes a major turn. Stanis Baratheon regroups his forces and heads north to help the nights watch defend the wall. His actions seem like that of a trustworthy king until he starts making demands of the nights watch. The Lanisters feel as if they have the war well in hand as they prepare for Jofferey's wedding, until tragedy teaches them otherwise. Across the sea, Princess Daneareys has accumulated and army, and has now started gaining a reputation as a conquering queen.<br /><br />It's strange doing a review of the third book in a series, especially when a reader will have to be pretty invested in the series to come this far. If you have read the first two then you definitely need to read this one. Storm of Swords is much better than Clash of Kings in my opinion. Much more gets done, the story makes a much larger leap forward, and we get answers to questions that were raised in Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Spoiler Section:<br /><br />I know I don't usually do this, but I had an urge to do one this time. If you have not read the book yet, don't read this section. I will be giving away too much. If you have, feel free to read and comment on this section.<br /><br />I guess the first thing to bring up are the deaths. Rob and Catelyn? Geez Martin what are you doing? I may not like his style, but he does have balls I'll give him that. Then we move onto Jofferey's death. In my opinion is was not satisfying enough. Perhaps no death would have been enough for him but at least make him cry like the little bitch he is before he get's offed. I wanted to see him cry and bleed before he died. Poison is just too clean. Oh well, ding dong the little bitch is dead!<br /><br />Well, as always I have to do a monologue about my favorite character: Princess Daneareys. Damn that was satisfying when she smacked the slave master with the whip. I am longing for the day she starts riding her dragons and causing some real havoc. To me she seems to be the only one who really should be sitting on the iron throne. She knows that ruling is a responsibility. Her decision at the end to stay in her newly conquered city and rule for a few years shows patience and wisdom well beyond her years. I would be very happy if she did come over to Westeros and conquered them. That seems to be the kick in the pants the realm needs.real havoc.

It is very gripping, feels authentic and I bet someone who starts reading it won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />I hope the pencil pushers in washington leaves this guy alone. I'm new to reading real soldiers accounts of what happened (also reading 'With the Old Breed' based on notes stashed in a book by a ww2 soldier), but it's necessary and refreshing since everything that comes out of washington is so skewed and perhaps at times untruthful.<br /><br />Thanks for writing this!

B0083HCK7S|1.0|Sister... I want to like this book but I just cant. I'm only half way through the book and find that I have to force myself to stay awake to read it, even in the morning. I'm not a fan of the author's writing skills. It's hard to follow and very confusing as there are times when you're not sure who she is talking to. The writing is all over the place and could move along a bit faster. I keep reading in hopes that it will start to go somewhere and get interesting, no such luck yet. The other reviews state that there is a twist at the end, which I hope there is. However, I'm not so sure it's worth reading an entire book for the ending. I will force myself to finish the book and if my mind has changed I will write a more positive review... Sept. 12, 2012, I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK... THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! It went from boring to pointless. The ending dropped off the face of the earth into blah blah blah blah blah land. So glad it's over, now I can read a book thats worth my time!

B008ETOSYI|5.0|Zac Efron brings this movie to life. He plays the role of a man who owes his life to one person, whom he has never even meant. He gets 5 stars, for his unforgettable performance, about real life . He touches our hearts and shows the suffering, not only in the battle field, but what use to be called ,\\" Home Sweet Home\\".

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is an English manor house which houses a family with four daughters and their bevy of servants. The second season picks up where the last season left off with the declaration of war. Everyone is in a tizzy about which men will volunteer or who will be called up, but the excitement soon dissipates as injuries and deaths from the war hit close to home. Downton Abbey is used to house convalescent soldiers and the women of the house find themselves doing useful work.<br /><br />This season has plenty of excitement and progresses nicely from the beginning of the war through to 1920 and we see history shaping the way the world works for the characters. The ending is a Christmas special which is highly satisfying and paves the way for an thrilling third season.

Amazon says Instant Video will not play on 2011 or 2012 Samsung TVs... Hmmm...
B005LAIH4A|3.0|As a kid, The Lorax was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss stories.  Not only did I enjoy the storytelling, but I also had a lot of fun watching the animated version based on the book.  One thing to remember about the animated Dr. Seuss of the 70s is that they were very faithful representations of the book.  They used the same art as the book and the script was very often an exact reading of the book text.<br /><br />I recently watched the 2012 updated version with my kids.  Even from the preview I could tell that the movie makers were taking some definite liberties with the story.  I didn't expect any major departures from the story, but it was clear that they would be adding considerable content into the \\"gaps\\" of the story.  NOTE: I'm going to be going over some of the additions to the story.  I assume that you're already familiar with the original book, so I don't claim any \\"spoilers\\" for that story, but if you want to be surprised, just skip to the end here for my overall opinion without risking spoiling any plot points for you.<br /><br />The movie gives a full storyline and family to the boy who goes to visit the Once-ler.  In the book, the boy is present on the periphery and is given a challenge at the end of the book but in the movie the boy becomes a central character named Ted.  Ted lives in \\"Thneed-Ville\\" named after the Thneeds invented by the Once-ler years ago.  Thneed-ville is a sort of plastic-mechanical city where all needs and recreation are provided by artificial man-made means and on the whole there is no real concept of \\"nature\\" or \\"natural\\" elements.  In fact, the current Mayor of Thneed-Ville makes his living by selling containers of clean air to the citizens.<br /><br />Ted has a crush on a girl in the town and learns that she has a dream to see a real living tree (rather than the plastic and metal imitations around town).  Ted learns about the Once-ler and decides to go outside of town to visit him.  Outside of town is a deserted wasteland stillsuffering the consequences of the Once-ler's industrial ravaging of the area.  He works his way through some strange booby traps to get to chat with the Once-ler.  Rather than having the Once-ler tell his entire story in one sitting (as seems to be the case in the book), Ted has to come back a few different times and each time, he has different obstacles in his way.<br /><br />As for the Once-ler's story, it also had some new elements added.  We get to know his family more in depth and they are quite the set of characters.  We spend quite a while with the Once-ler before he becomes a mega greedy corporate millionaire.  We actually see the Once-ler and the Lorax build up quite the relationship, which is interesting.<br /><br />During the Once-ler's story, we also get to know the Lorax in a more personal way than in the book.  This is a lot of fun, but I felt like it came a little at the expense of some of the aspects of the Lorax's personality from the book.  I felt like Danny DeVito did a great job voicing the Lorax.  But I missed some of his quirky rhyming couplets and behavior.  I also missed some of the songs and music from the previous movie.  There were songs in this one but they were rather different in scope and tone.<br /><br />One very interesting addition is that this movie continues on AFTER the story from the book ends.  We get to see what happens after the Once-ler gives Ted the challenge of \\"Unless.\\"  The ending sequence of the movie includes vehicle chases, confrontations with big baddies and overcoming high odds in search of a higher goal.  Where the book left the action in the hands of the reader (or viewer), this movie explicitly drives home the resolution that should be taken.<br /><br />Overall, I still really enjoyed the story of the Lorax and had fun with this movie.  I didn't see it in 3D but it was very evident which scenes were specifically built to try and take advantage of the 3D ins and outs.  There were a number of things I nostalgicallymissed from the book and 1970s movie, but generally this was true to the nature of the story.  I had fun with some of the additions to the story though I could have done without a lot of them.  The kids really enjoyed the movie.  I'm not sure if they've seen the old one recently enough to remember it and I'm not sure the last time I'd read the book with them (or that they read it on their own).  I'll have to encourage them to do so.<br /><br />Generally, this was a fun movie.  If you're a fan of the Lorax, you should enjoy it.  If you're a fan of kids movies, you should have fun as well...there's good animation and solid kid humor.  If you're a die-hard purist when it comes to Dr. Seuss, you may be a little disappointed at the changes made.<br /><br />***<br />3 out of 5 stars
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I enjoyed this book for the moral dilemma as well as the most beautiful storyline. Definitely a book for repeated reading.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a well written book. I think it was a little too sexually orientated to be sold at costco.The ending leaves you having to read the 2nd book.I would recomend this book to some of my friends.Not all of them.

B004KA9VGA|5.0|I came across this book by accident and was  totally intrigued.<br />I love historical fiction, I love witches and thought combing the two would make a great tale.<br />It was a bit of a surprise to find a vampire and I would categorise it as a vampire book and a really good one.<br /><br />This book  has the love story that Bella and Edward tried but failed to inspire us with. There is lots of Vampire lore, lots of twists and turns,a little bit of magic ala Harry Potter, and a little bit of historical fiction (very well researched I might add because the author is a well known and well respected historian).<br /><br />I read the book to quickly and as with all good books it came to an end before I was ready to leave the world  it created. It does not leave you hanging so you have to go out and buy the next book which is something that often annoys me. However there are  another 2 books to follow . I will definitely read them but this time I will savour them and read slowly because I am sure the author cant write as fast as I can read and I will be sorry to see the end of this story.<br /><br />Five stars - loved it, I cant think of a single thing to criticise.
0307730697|4.0|In the end, I really liked the book, but getting there took some work. I'm not sure why the first half of the book moved so slowly. Mr. Brown certainly had an interesting upbringing, yet the reading was tedious. The second half of the book was excellent. Overall I recommend this as a read. Mr. Brown is a hero, as are all the men and women who've died serving their country. But in this story, the biggest heroes are Mr. Browns parents and his wife-what unconditional love they had.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Great read! I enjoyed the historical references along with the love story.  The characters were very likable.  By reading the description that is published with the book, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  I'm glad I listened to friends instead of relying on the publishers synopsis.
B005GTJEZC|2.0|As an HP fan, I am tempted to buy this set with all the movies and extra features to date. I've been waiting for a complete HP boxed set for a looong time. However, what I really want are just the blu-ray movies (obviously extended cuts if possible, but don't think that will happen) and all the extra features and behind-the-scenes.  I don't really need all the extra bells-and-whistles (maps, cards, locket, DVD duplicate movies, etc), and I don't want to pay the high price for what I honestly consider just a bunch of junk (not being a collector, just an average fan).  Can't WB put out a box set of all the Ultimate Editions that would include only blu-ray discs and ALL the special features and commentary?  Priced in the $150-200 range?  I'm thinking/hoping that after all the hype of the Wizards Collection is over, a set like this will probably show up. That is what I am waiting for. Why is WB making us wait so long for a reasonably-priced set that includes what fans REALLY WANT?
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Loved it! Actors were chosen very well, story did not drag on and on, and the ending was perfect :)

B0031RS2HC|5.0|Read this through twice now, just as good the Second time, Lee Cjild is an awesome author and Jack Reacher a great character
B0086DB566|5.0|Mirror Mirror is a great movie.  It's a remake of Snow White, modernized.  I never tire of watching it over and over.  Julia Roberts is the perfect evil queen and Lilly Collins plays a great Snow White.  Nathan Lane makes the movie with his role as the \\"Executive Boot-Licker\\"!  Fantastic for children and that little girl inside of every woman. :)

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I never thought I I could review a book before I had completed it. I found it did not matter that I had not completed it, or indeed that it was the second book in a trilogy, and I had never read the first book. I had heard that it was the sexiest book I had ever read or was likely to read in the future, and I was not disappointed. Christian and Ana, the Fifty Shades protagonist and his love, find find a different way to ravage each other sexually on every other page.<br /><br />If you like to read before your go to bed, and want a long dreamless sleep, do not read Fifty Shades, Darker or Lighter. It will keep you awake looking for the next boudoir encounter.<br /><br />My goodness, Amazon, what have you done to my reading habits!!

0385341008|5.0|I love this book! Especially in its letter writing presentation. It is a wonderful way to show the \\"between the lines\\" of life, the real feelings and thought processes of its writers. I fell in love with its characters. Contrived is what some negative reviews have said. Well, all I can is how small your world must be. You've not had the privilege to know funny, sweet, romantic, sad, quirky, good and bad characters from this era. Or maybe you haven't lived in a small town setting that is not set in some stark, modern and manipulative world and that doesn't know the true currents of a happy and healthy community. It is definitely set in a different time when integrity and honor were valued and unspeakable evil changed lives and history forever. A time when real emotion and thoughts were put into letters, not wordsmithed in emails or abbreviated in one line nothingness. It is just simply a very sweet tale of tragedy, love, and the ability to keep living and loving. It's a book to be enjoyed that hopefully will enlighten you, make you life and cry, make you crave a connection to interesting people from a lost era - like rooting through your grandmother's box of old letters. The characters and the community in this book were very real to me, because I have known a few of them. Simple is good. Let go and just enjoy the ride.

B005LAII0S|1.0|Stay away from it!!! It's the most boring movie I have ever seen! This movie was neither humorous nor dramatic, they try to mix both genders at the same time and the result are 100 minutes of nonsense and torture!!! It is a pathetic attempt to innovate. If you don't believe me buy it, but be prepare to hear I told you so. Don't throw away your money, I think it should be better spend in a charity. With all due respect to all those who enjoy this movie they should go to the psychologist ASAP!!!
1475143389|5.0|I got all of Mike's books yesterday 7pm and I've been busting through the pages like crazy. This is very good information, very well explained and easy to digest. I think the power of Michael is that he is not writing to impress or sell or advertise his products, he is writing to help you be the best you. Unlike other fitness programs that also work and are effective, BLS is not a \\"do this diet, buy my products\\" type of deal. Beware, you find those and the thing they want is your money!!!!!<br /><br />I'm glad to support (and be part of) this new generation of humans looking to serve and nothing else. Make a living out of what you worked so hard to learn and be able to explain to other so they get benefits. Please, support this kind of individuals. You will not only get BLS but will also support the right team.<br /><br />PS. I will update this post later to explain my progress.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not sure if I hated the author for creating the main character, who is dull and talks to both herself and others like a petulent 15-year-old, or if I just hated the main character, but either way, much of the book is unreadable.  The main character has internal conversations that are simultaneously uncreative and annoying.  Her external conversations are also uncreative and annoying.  I almost quit before I got to any of the sex.<br /><br />That said, this is the first book I ever read where the descriptions of the sex were better than anything else in the book.  My guess is the editors only bothered to read those parts.  They were not great but at least tolerable.  My suggestion is that you take the cues from the editors and skip the rest, as well.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|In my opinion The Prisoner of Heaven is the best book by this author to date.  I had a hard time putting it down until it was finished.

I know that this was the thriller of the summer and I did find it to be a fast and fun read.  I was highly disappointed by the ending though.  It left me feeling let down and questioning whether I wasted my time reading the book.  I debated between 2 and 3 stars.  I gave it 3 because I did have fun reading most of the book.  Not sure I would read this author again though because of the disappointing ending.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I was not familiar with the author, but picked the book up on a recommendation from a colleague.  The characters are vivid and you feel compelled by their story. There are some who are loathsome and you quickly come to hate like your own arch nemesis. My single complaint is that the book had several grammatical errors that slipped by the publisher. While none of them break the story, I always find it disconnecting to have to puzzle out what a sentence is \\"supposed\\" to mean, when a word is missing or some other flaw. Not enough to stop me from giving the book a big thumbs up. I look forward to the next book in the series, but have a few other books ahead of them first.

B0080CL0HM|4.0|Most others provide a detailed explanation of why or why not one should see this movie. I was simply curious, what with Rob P.'s vampire roles & was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I didn't expect to be engaged (I typically need the sci-fi, intense genre to rivet my attention); & I watched the entire movie. A chick flick to be sure IMHO. And out of my genre, one I enjoyed.
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|Well, what needs to be said about a bio about this great & gifted person that we lost at way too young of an age. All of those benefit concerts that we see today would maybe not have come to be without George just trying to help his friend when Ravi asked for help. Lots of respect for a man who went the way of trying things differently than the rest of the world. Great introspect of George when he was with the Beatles and his amazing career afterwards. Definately worth more than just a watch of one time which is the reason that I purchased it. I see more things every time that I watch it. So if you want an uplifting bio of a good man that will also make you feel good about the things he had done for the world while here, this is the film to watch!!! Enjoy living in this material world while you can.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed this book and am surprised to see how many reviewers not only weren't impressed, but hated it.  For me, the strength of this book lies in how Ken told the story from both sides of the conflict of the war.  I don't read a lot of history, so I found his descriptions of the events and contrasting it against the changes going on simultaneously in society to be very intriguing.  Most history fed to American's (myself included) is so one-sided that you'd think that the \\"other\\" side was pure evil, when the reality is that both sides had legitimate concerns and that it is the powerful and not the people.  Most are just pawns in the games.  A second interesting part was the illustration of how life was for workers providing an understanding for the surge of communist sympathizers during the period and the ultimate workers uprisings.  Many union busters forget what transpired to get us to where we are with labor when a just a 100 years ago children slaved alongside their parents in coal mines and factories working 12+ hour days just to live in hovels, barely eking out a life.<br /><br />Compared to Pillars of the Earth, which is one of my favorites books, it doesn't meet that bar, but it is an enjoyable and engaging read. IMHO.

B0009QTS1M|4.0|I just received the three-disk DVD--two versions of the film plus two disks of supplemental material. I'm not sure the supplemental disks are necessary. But the extended edition of the film itself fleshes out a few things left unexplained in the original theatrical release, which I saw in 2000. The chief difference, for me, is why Quintus (Tomas Arana) orders his Praetorians to sheathe their swords during the climactic fight between Maximus and Commodus. The Emperor had ordered him to execute two of his men for concealing the fact that Maximus escaped the forest execution. Though Quintus defends his men and his own actions, it is clear that Commodus is not buying it; and I suspect that Quintus, who was in fact Maximus' friend and immediate subordinate in Germania, was complicit in facilitating Naximus' escape. The final sequence represents a kind of payback to the Emperor for what he made Quintus do, i.e., execute his own men. He will let the fight proceed even if it means the death of Commodus.<br /><br />For the film itself, Gladiator never loses its power. It is a dark and brooding saga that never quite made sense to me as a revenge tragedy until Ridley Scott explained it as a journey of a man who wants to go home, rather like Odysseus. Maximus has lost through murder his wife, his son, and his place in Roman society. He seeks vengeance--almost suicide by duel--to take him to the Afterlife where he can be reunited with the only two people he loves in this world. When Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) whispers to him \\"You're home\\" she understand the nature of Maximus' epic journey to rejoin his family.<br /><br />One of the interesting supplements deals with May 1999, when Oliver Reed died unexpectedly, and how the filmmakers dealt with the gaps he left. In a word, brilliantly. Reed's performance was great, and sustained the dark nature of the film. Crowe reputedly is both a consummate professional and grating pain in the butt. So, for that matter, was Phoenix as Commodus, who showed us the wounded nature of the man who could take his own father's life from shame and emotional desertion, and then turn to incestuous love for his sister.<br /><br />The battlefield scene in the first part of the movie defines the universe as cruel and merciless. That vision prepares us for the arenas at Zucchubar and Rome itself. Win or die: there are no middle grounds.who showed us the wounded nature of the man who could take his own father's life from shame and emotional desertion, and then turn to incestuous love for his sister.<br /><br />The battlefield scene in the first part of the movie defines the universe as cruel and merciless.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The charging cord is fine as far as it goes.  But what I should also have gotten, or maybe it should have been included, is the overpriced adapter to plug it into a regular household 110v electric circuit.  Either that or I should have bought it at the same time, but the $20 price, maybe plus shipping, just turned me off.
0786955570|4.0|I became aware of this game because of Youtube videos produced at[...]/user/WatchItPlayed by Rodney Smith and his family.  They actually played through [[ASIN:0786955708 Wrath of Ashardalon: A D&D Boardgame]], another game of the same ilk, from the same game company, that can actually be used as a companion to this.  I'm considering buying that game as well as the [[ASIN:0786958731 Wizards of The Coast Legend of Drizzt: A Dungeons and Dragons Board Game]], as I'm the type of person that likes to have \\"all\\" the options.    It's a fun game to play.  My daughter and I played through a full adventure and won on the first try, but it was very close.  We definitely had to play strategically with each other to maximize our chance of winning.  It's nice to play a game that you can experience cooperatively and enjoy success (and failure) together. I had never played a cooperative board/box game, having grown up mostly with games like Monopoly and such.  My only experience cooperative play was in full official roleplaying games, which I no longer have time or know enough people to play. If you're looking for something to play as a family, and you like fantasy game settings, it's hard to argue against this game.    The rules can be slightly confusing, to start, mostly it's tough to remember the various things that happen as each tile is revealed and as you progress through each turn, but it became quite fluid for us about midway through the first starter game.  The Youtube videos help quite a bit, and the play through I saw, was a big part of why I made the initial purchase.  My one negative comment would be that the rules could do with some revision/reformatting to make them more clear, particularly when they reference the general rules/setup to the specific adventure setup.

I have a 5-year-old grandson who has Asperger's Syndrome. I just spent 3 weeks with him and I noticed a few of these quirky behaviors (Asperger's is not as severe as this boy's autism). The book is written in a marvelous voice. I felt like I was in this kids brain and it was fascinating. I have already read some books about autism from a scientific perspective. I will vote for readers desiring insight into autism to read this novel. It gives a terrific look into the thinking of a child with this condition. A very few times I found myself skimming because I was not as interested in his mathematical explanations. Aside from that, I really found it was an awesome read and an excellent glimpse into this boy's world.<br /><br />Barbara Anne Waite, Memoir Author-\\"Elsie-Adventures of an Arizona Schoolteacher 1913-1916\\"

0425263908|2.0|I was hopeful when I started reading this book, but not at all impressed by it when I finished it.  In fact, finishing it was a struggle.  Yeah, it has sex, but far too much missionary.  I felt like I was visiting a convent for deviant personalities. I didn't care about either character Eva or Gideon.  Also, too many things were left unresolved, which didn't make me want to read the next book to find out what happened between Gideon and his family.  Something more should have been revealed to keep the reader interested.

B0084IHVC0|5.0|The Aristocats was made after Walt Disney's death and was the first animated film without his involvement. His last film, The Jungle Book, released one year after his death was very well received and in the way to become a classic (which now is). The Aristocats, released in 1970 does not enjoy the same status as its predecessor but is still a perfectly nice family film with great characters, catchy songs and delightful antics. It may not be as polished or sentimental as previous Disney films but its still a great ride to enjoy multiple times.<br /><br />Many things make The Aristocats a memorable adventure: The characters are charming and funny, none of them (including the children) are annoying. The voice cast is excellent and even though Phil Harris essentially channels Baloo into Thomas O'Malley, he's still a hoot. Another asset are the songs. Written and composed by the legendary team of Richard and Robert Sherman, the songs are catchy, invigorating and memorable (especially \\"Everybody Wants to be a Cat\\"). The animation is nothing extraordinary but serves the film right.<br /><br />All in all, The Aristocats may not be a masterpiece but is still tons of fun.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br /><br />The Aristocats looks excellent on BD. Disney has restored the film and the results are great. Detail is clear, the image is completely clean and the lines of look is still preserved. A very good transfer that easily surpasses all the previous Home Video releases.<br /><br />Audio comes in the form of a 5.1 DTS-HD MA and delivers the goods. It may not be a bombastic experience but its a clean, stable and clear audio. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Bonus Material<br /><br />Due to the fact that this film is not very popular as other Disney films, extras are very slim but there's still some good things in here.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Open\\" is an all new, recently found deleted song. Introduced by composer Richard Sherman, the song was supposedly placed at the beginning of the film and had a character that was later deleted from the final cut. The song is nice, but I think is better it was cut off.<br /><br />\\"Ouie, Ouie Marie\\" is a pointless music video featuring the little female kitten.<br /><br />\\"The Sherman Brothers, The Aristocrats of Disney Songs\\" is a nice piece that honors the legendary duo and although is very short is a nice glimpse inside their creative process.<br /><br />\\"She never felt Alone\\" is another deleted song introduced by Richard Sherman<br /><br />\\"Disney Song Selection\\"<br /><br />\\"1956 Animated Special Excerpt\\" is a TV special hosted by Walt Disney and dealing with cats.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is the best I've EVER read. I love Christian Grey!! There should be a movie in the making.
B0087DFIYA|5.0|If you like \\"Payback\\", which I did, you will enjoy \\"Get the Gringo\\".  In the making of the movie extras, Mel states there was nothing in the movie that they did not see in Mexico.  If that is true, then this film is somewhat of a revelation.  I think it was worth the cash, and Mel does very well in these sort of roles.  I don't know about the hand grenade bit in the film though. That was a lucky catch, and stretching reality; when you watch the film you will see what I mean.  I have thrown grenades and fired grenade launchers, and I for one, would get down in cover, rather than trying something heroic.  And unlike the movies, when a grenade goes off it is like thunder, shakes the ground, and is quite scary.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books and the movie.  The Extra bonus cd about the movie was really good.  The letters from the Rose garden were the best.  Donald Sutherland really defined President Snow's power.  When it was all said and done I found myself thinking that our world could really be heading this direction.  Watched this video and then made friends and family watch as well.  Amazing how they want to read the books after seeing it.  I have not been this moved by a movie in a long time.  Just to go and dig deeper to see the true meaning of the story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent read! The entire trilogy is unforgettably great! Can't wait for other works by the author! I am looking forward to her US book signing tour!!!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Great movie. Recommend for a good night of movie watching.This movie Will make you think about right and wrong in our society.
B008400S0K|5.0|Tina Fey is a treasure.....listening to her voice share the narrative was a double bonus. But I don't recommend it while you're sitting in the dentist's chair.....my hygienist did not really appreciate all the laughing. Funny, Funny, Funny!
B005SAJJHM|5.0|The Big Bang Theory sneaked up on me through reruns, and before I knew it I was hooked on Sheldon. Great escape comedy if you've had a bad day. The characters are truly loveable. Even Sheldon!  My favorite Sheldon line of all time is, \\"Oh what fresh hell is this?!\\"
B007SGM084|3.0|the first book I thought was entertaining, and I liked Anastasia´s character.<br />On the second and third book I was completely bored, and she seemed the most insecure, childish and dumb character ever....
B001BC5HXG|4.0|Very slow starting but I found myself wanting to continue about 25% of the way through.  I enjoyed his analysis of life through the various characters.  Great development and depth of characters.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.... reminded me a bit of the help, but an engaging story!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I thought it was a well written prequel. I must say that a few questions were left unanswered and I had hoped it would involve more of the known characters, but I suppose they were unimportant at this particular time. At the same time, I liked how it was new and fresh. It left me hanging on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened next. I, personally, loved it!
B000OVLINI|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the first page.  I read it in 2 days and moved on to Angel's Game, and The Prisoner of Heaven.  Zafon's imagery is brilliant, his writing crisp, and his plots are intriguing.  However, he can be irritatingly incomplete sometimes.  I found the ending of the  book disappointing, and almost had a feeling that it was a rush job.  There are parts of his other books that border on genius as well, but none of them are flawless.  I hope Zafon keeps developing as an author - he has potential to be one of the greats.
034580404X|5.0|The price was amazing shipping was fast and the books are grand thank you ,...and did I say that the price was AWESOME !!!!!
B008YYCK8O|5.0|One of the best shows on cable television. Definitely in the top 5. The second season has been the best.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|It's a pretty good flick. It has it's good and funny moments. It's a good chick flick and date movie.
B003G8W0GA|5.0|I never was much for scifi or time travel until I got stuck in the room with a Dr. Who spinoff called Torchwood, since then who's been my obsession.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, kept me on my toes and can't wait to read book 2: catching fire. I would recommend this book to all my friends!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard a lot about the book and was unsure about reading it... I am so glad I did! This book was one of the best books I have read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The whole time I was reading it I wanted more. I fell in love with all the characters. I would recommend it to anyone I know!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Started the third book on my vacation and I'm not sure if I spent more time with the book or my family...:)
B00846REIS|2.0|I thought the story was 'sick'.  Too much oral sex and too explicit; made me want to throw up.  The limo scene was disgusting and after that, how could they attend a party and still be well dressed?  It just made me think of 'bad breath'.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can hardly wait to read the third book after reading this one. What a great series - I want more Grey!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I checked and my new Google Nexus 7 is same size as Kindle Fire so took a chance and ordered the tan case. Looks great! Fits great! Feels great! Need to watch upper right corner strap as it goes right over the power switch. (I set my Nexus 7 to automatically go to sleep after 10 minutes in case it gets accidentally turned on.) Nice to merge old world look and modern electronics.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|OMG BEST APP EVER STEAM IS AWESOME if a gamer I HIGHLY recommend this app for u by far the bet app ever!!!!! STEAM!!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great entertainment! The best human hunting movie ever. Miss Lawrence sizzles, on fire! I highly recommend you see this one. I usually don't do reviews. Obviously LOL!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|downloaded this game for free. it works great the Samsung galaxy s 3 and is alot of fun :-) would recommend to friends and family. check it out!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have to say this app has every thing you need to for all a person on the go needs don't take it away I use it for a lot of reasons
B001BZF9UY|5.0|I love this movie score.  I've been listening to it every day on my commute to and from work for a couple weeks now.  Each track is different enough to not get old, yet still retains a common theme.  You can hear in the composition and orchestration exactly what character was on screen at the time.  I don't typically buy a whole movie soundtrack album since most of the time there are only one or two great tracks....this one is fantastic all the way through.  Well done gentlemen, well done.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|Acting was good, story line only fair as it was predictable, hardly a memorable movie, probably only worth a $1.99 hire fee rather than the $3.99 I paid!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i have a part time job and i use this app in my cel and my kindle to make promotions. i love it! !!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader but after talking to a friend's daughter, I finally had to see what this was all about.  I fell in love with these characters. I laughed, I cried, and of course...<br /><br />I read all 3 books within 2 weeks, almost every chapter had a cliff-hanger and I had to see what happened next. When I was finished I started to read them again. I was not ready to say good-bye to Christen and Ana.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to find so many ideas for my home, my kids rooms, and everything else imaginable! I love pinterest!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Worth a free go of it for sure! Have been playing on my kindle fire non stop since I downloaded it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like this game its my favorite out of the angry birds series. My kids love to play this all the time
B000057IYN|5.0|The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great book.  I cannot wait for the next one to come out in October.  It is a very graphic sexual book, but well worth it.
B007TMON8M|1.0|Absolutely retarded. The laws of physics don't apply in this game. It actually got to the point where my structure was not collapsing but it would tell me it failed. Uninstalled.
0812993292|5.0|I loved this little book. Being of similar age and same gender (but not yet retired), I found Harold Fry's journey to be moving and beautiful. The writing took me with him, and I never felt like I was reading a book, but instead experiencing his pilgrimage, with all of the joy, frustrations and pain that he experienced (kind of like life).  I highly recommend The Unlikely Pilgrimage.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Kindle edition.<br />A great story, although \\"Old Man\\" may be somewhat misleading... I would love to have a prequel. Haven't read anything else from Scalzi yet, but I promise I will. Which in itself will be proof I enjoyed the tale. For hard core military sci-fi fans, this is a must-read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very nice app. Does exactly what is intended for. I would recommend this to anyone looking this type of app.
B005TKD8ZK|4.0|Kindle edition.<br />Running is more than working out. Running can be an almost transcending experience. Murakami is a great author, his stories about the joy and pains of pushing your mind and body through hours of endurance are well-written and an inspiration for all of us middle-aged weekend warriors.<br />No ultra-marathon, bare-foot, health-hippie evangelism. Just one man formulating why he keeps on running. And formulating it for the rest of us, too.<br />Expect no advice of running shoes, technique or training program. This is a personal tale, which I guess most of us can relate to. A great read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you use pinterest as much as I do, this app is for you! It's so convenient and easy to use. I'm so excited that it is an app now!
B002QYSZBO|5.0|This is my standby feel-good movie.  Always funny!  Robert Downey jr is outstanding and Val Kilmer is a perfect straight  man for him.  Highly recommend this, just not for younger viewers due to language and some nudity.
1433502410|5.0|I already had an ESV study Bible for myself and loved it. The reason why I bought another one is because they wanted a study Bible as well. The ESV is very easy to read, easily understandable. Again, I love it!
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after 50 shades which made it seem a little repetitive but it moves a lot faster then 50 shades. It was awesome and I can't wait for the next one to come out!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I appreciated the disclosure of more information that did not have to do with the bedroom or playroom only. Although some parts continue to be to outrageous there continues to be a level of reality and trueness to the story. I was just as engaged in this book as I was in the first one. I would recommend all book one readers to continue reading the trilogy.
B003EY62II|3.0|My five year old granddaughter loves Scooby-Doo, the cartoon so she wanted to see the movie.  She had nightmares after seeing this movie.  It was a fairly good movie, per se, but too violent for younger kids.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very challenging! runs very well and is well made. hope you all make more titles. not very relaxing since it is so addictive.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I Loved this movie! My group of friends were the first group to get to watch it since we camped out before everyone else did. But it was great!
B008JH5CVS|1.0|Honnestly one of the first very boring unfocused mmovies in a long time<br />I wouldt recommend this to eny. One looking for a good film two thumbs down
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater and it was even better on Blu-Ray.  I saw so many things at home that I never saw in the theater.  The fact that the digital copy came with it made it even better.  Now I can watch it on any device whereever I am.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is absolutely a must read for anyone who is married. It's opened up my eyes on how to better love my wife, in a way that means the mpst to her.
B00355L2TU|2.0|ESD was to be Sept 5, and I haven't received it yet. Once I do, I can change my review. I purchased the DVD on August 13th. It's been more than 2 weeks.<br />Not satisfied at all.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We had to hide it from the kids until we beat all the levels because we knew we might not get it back!
1933952806|5.0|I got this book at the same time I got my D7000. I read it cover to cover with my D7000 in hand. Very helpful and easy to understand.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very interesting, It was sexually explicit, but there is actually a story behind the whole book. Once you read book one you must get book two and then book three.  Happy reading!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!! Read it twice in one week. Hard to put down.Extremely excited for Deeper in you to come out!!
B007WTR2W6|4.0|It's not all about $100 startups, but about startups that began with very low budget. The book is very well written, very informative and provide good detail on the steps to start your own business in a way I never saw in another book before. I definitely recommend it, it helps changing our mindset to stop working for other people and begin working for ourselves. I also recommend to follow the author's blog that contains a lot more informations about his lifestyle and stories about other people that had success in creating their own business, some from very unusual ideas.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have to say that at first I wasn't too into the new \\"MGMT\\" like music, but as time goes on and more and more songs come out within that genre I find myself more and more in love with the type of music. Fun. exemplifies this genre and leads with some of the songs on this album.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Dreadfully written, virtually no plot and two dimensional characters. If she says \\"Oh my\\" once more.... It's all about the sex and that gets enough already! Just shows what lots of hype can do.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very well written.  I thought I already knew much about Steve Jobs, but this book revealed so much more!  Jobs was such an important person and he chose well in having this author present his story. And it is such an awesome story.  Actually, an unbelievable story.  An inspiring story.  A sad story. This was an outstanding buy!
B005L38QK2|5.0|This product os awesome, is exactly what I Expected and has made my gaming experience for Diablo 3 much better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|We enjoy completing all the families and decorating our village. We get excited when we get a new baby. The graphics are wonderful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was awesome. I was looking for something different to read. Well, I found it!! Couldn't put it down. Intriguing story line, strategy, and action.  Great character development. I am 46 years old and thought it was just entertainment for teens and young adults - I was wrong. LOVED IT!Now I am hooked. A must read.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is fun to play if you like the match three games. A lot of story in it and not as fun as Fishdom but if you like Playrix games you will like this one. Worth it's money.
B000060MMI|5.0|I am a relatively new Flogging Molly fan, and let me tell you, I could not be more satisfied with this purchase. This album has that passionate, driving, fiery, fervid sensation that you'd expect from the band. As corny as this may sound, I play this album in my car on long trips because it makes the drive feel more like a journey. This album has some of my all-time favorite songs from the band, including \\"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\\", \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\", and \\"Drunken Lullabies\\". While some of the newer albums are equally satisfying, I don't think they quite compare to the energy that this album brings. I will never grow tired of Flogging Molly's amazing instrumentation, keen story-telling ability, and exciting melodies. I don't think I could recommend this album enough. Even if you've never heard a single thing from Flogging Molly, I'm quite confident you will become very fond of this album and all of the band's music.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was very good, in fact almost like the book which I really enjoyed. I read the book before I saw the movie so I was happy they stuck to it as close as they did. I would recommend this movie.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|love these headphones, funny amazon asks me to review as I was just telling the guy who turned me on to them yesterday how much I appreciated his rec. we are both in radio so we are pretty hard to please, i like these better than a pair of bose I have which sell for about $50 more. love the full sound and they are quiet to those around me, love the interchangeable connections and the fat cord for great transmission!
B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" was a crazy, bizarre, suspenceful ride of surprises.  I absolutely could not put it down! Our society today, automatically looks to the husband when the wife has gone missing, it is a very natural response for most of us these days.  However, the twists and turns of this book were anything but natural or ordinary.  Great read!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Our grand kids love this movie . We ended up watching this almost every other day on our summer trip. Kids did not get bored. After the third time we watched it, it got a little too much for me . But I guess that is true for every movie for an adult.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is at least twice as good as Season 1. The emotional highs and lows are unreal as are the twists and turns in the plot. Believe me, there is much about this series that I did not see coming! The last episode, the Christmas Special, is one for the ages.
1451648537|4.0|I did not realize S. Jobs was so ...... Hard to find a word for it. I am just glad I read this since I appreciated my life a lot more. If wealth and success gonna come at that cost, I don't want it. This book gave me more appreciation of my life, and showed me what i should NOT do.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|A fun ride in all respects. Worth a few hours of your life in front of both the big screen and the small screen.
B006H5120E|2.0|This came to me as a gift. I watched the movie only once before and that was in a movie theater. It was magical. That is why i was so disappointed watching this at home. It did not have the magic. I wished I never watched it on my TV and remember this movie with that theater experience.
0688156819|2.0|when i first it, title sticker was coming off, was scratched, couple bent pages. all in all good read but pretty bad condition.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I watched the entire season in a week. VERY addicting show and I can't wait until the 3rd season becomes available. .
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is just what the doctor ordered! A little bit of humor, a little bit of advice, there's something for every occasion it seems like! Love it!
0470913029|2.0|While I need to be gluten and this diet provides that I didn't feel that it met my overall needs, I felt tired after long runs and had problems recovering.
B007IJDXFK|5.0|I have purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years, but I've never felt motivated to write a review..., until now.  Why now??  Two reasons:  1) This album is definitely noteworthy, to say the least.  It's amazing, artistic, and..., different!  2) I recently visited a local music store which is well known for stocking music \\"below the radar\\", especially metal and alternate.  During this visit, I was disappointed to discover they didn't stock a single CD, new or used, from Anathema.  Based on this, I decided I want to help get the word out.  Music such as this should be more accessible and better acknowledged by our music outlets.  Sure, I like The Foo Fighters, Rush, and Radiohead; staples which were available in abundance at this store.  But there are so many other talented artists producing some incredible albums, which 99% of the population have never heard!  I believe this release is a perfect example of that.<br /><br />The last time I felt this excited discovering an album from a band I never knew existed, I was giving my first listen to \\"Stupid Dream\\" by Porcupine Tree.  \\"Weather Systems\\" is a different animal from that. It is less technical musically, but I believe it makes up for that with its sheer beauty (especially the vocals), energy, maturity, and heart.  Now I'm looking forward to my first listen to \\"We're Here Because We're Here\\".<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the entire album needs to be played as one long piece.  This isn't intended to be a collection of individual songs shuffled about on an ipod.  For this album, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Give it a listen, and if it strikes a chord with you, get the word out!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!  So many twists and turns. It was a slow start but quickly became a page turner. I cant wait to read other stories by this author.  I really like the way she develops the characters.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not the first erotica I've ever read, but the first erotica written for a third grade reading level. Please do not buy, do not read, and do not discuss.
B007TMON8M|1.0|After reading another review pointing out that the developer started with 5 fake 5 star reviews, I decided not to download, even though it is the FAOTD.  Who wants something from liars?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a nice relaxing game.  It's challenging and interesting and entertaining.  Everything you could ask for in game.  Graphics are very good and touch response to your fingertips or pen is wonderful.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works as advertised. Smooth, easy and syncs with google calendar perfect.Would recommend it to anyone with a Fire that uses Google Calendar.
0307592731|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK ...My daughter told me she was reading \\"Wild\\" and she was loving it. W She is a hiker and a camper.  I am not and really dislike getting dirty.  Well written and very interesting...thanks for the exciting journey.  This book really open my eyes to another world.  This book makes you see that you can over come so much in life no matter how bumpy the journey gets.  This lady lets you into her world warts and all so that you can see into her soul.  I wish her the best in life she is truely wonderful human being.  I don't have much in common with this lady other than I have traveled my own bumpy journey.
B0043U937Y|5.0|Loved this series, i wish this was once every week. Perfect for grownups only, there is a lot of sex,violence and drama.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|Stargate Continuum is one of the best Stargate items I have watched.  I own the complete Stargate series of SG1 with the movies as well as Stargate The Ark of Truth.  I also own all of the Stargate Atlantis series and in my opinion though all of them are Great and worth watching over and over (which I do), Stargate Continuum is the best overall.[[ASIN:B0017MO10U Stargate: Continuum]]
B0043U98RY|5.0|I loved the suspence the drama and of course the geourges men in this series. While i was watching the show, it kept me on the edge of me seat. I didnt know what to expect next. Loved it....
B000TGXT0S|5.0|This album is amazing. Haven't heard it in years, ex-wife got the CD lol. Anyways, I am able to workout so much better listening to this. Makes me wanna keep going.
B006XB267K|5.0|As usual, the writers created an extremely creative and hilarious (if you are as warped as i am) episode. I look forward to each and every episode, but the woman playing \\"Bobby\\" was an extra treat the way she so matter-of-factly ogled Dean.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />  The title of this review paraphrases the question an exasperated Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) levels against Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) in \\"The Avengers\\".  Without hesitation, Stark coolly answers that he is an industrialist, billionaire, playboy, inventor, etc.  Of course, you could ask the same question of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) throughout the Dark Knight trilogy, especially the second sequel \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" (hereafter \\"DK Rises') and essentially get the same answer, albeit without Stark's smug insouciance.  But is that all there is to Batman/Wayne - just the Gotham legend?  What about the man himself?  Who is he?  To my amazement, among all the Bondian plotting, intricate intrigue, nihilistic villainy, and apocalyptic despair, \\"DK Rises\\" manages to take a deeper peek into Wayne's soul than any other Batman medium and painfully extract more of his true, human essence.<br /><br />  Unquestionably, the Batman character is a remarkable legend and symbol - resourceful, agile, nimble-witted, incisive, daring, and persistent.  But, in my opinion, for many of us, the non-superpowered Batman ironically suffered from Superman's impediment - he was too good.  Independently wealthy, and seemingly free from mere mortals' mundane concerns, Batman had the time to employ an almost endless panoply of weapons, gimmicks, and devices to indulge his \\"favorite pastime\\" - foil all his hapless enemies, even the most grotesque ones.  Batman was so charismatic that he inspired even his most implacable foes to \\"play by the rules\\" and defeat Batman fair and square.  True, he suffered the trauma of seeing his parents killed by hoodlums, but for a long time that was treated as just the catalyst for his transformation to Batman.  Except for that, Batman/Wayne led a charmed, cocooned, almost-bland life.  Wow, what a near-perfect presence Batman is, and how \\"perfectly\\" boring!<br /><br />  Subtly, \\"DK Rises\\" evokes the inspirational aura of Batman by keeping him (for at least the first 40% of the movie) as a morale-boosting, if hidden, ideal for the citizens of Gotham, even if he was (wrongfully) implicated in District Attorney Harvey Dent's death.  But gradually, we see the frail, almost decrepit shut-in within the Wayne Manor fortress, doted upon by faithful, paternal manservant Alfred (Michael Caine).  Quite logically and understandably, Alfred has so far persuaded the aged Wayne to give up the Bat-madness and lead a more conventional, comfortable life.  But Bane (Tom Hardy), a cross between Hannibal Lecter, Marvel Comics' Juggernaut, and a WWF refugee, arrives in Gotham to insidiously lull and encourage the proletariat masses to oust their 1% bourgeois oppressors, then traitorously blow them up with a nuclear device almost no one can disarm. Before that, he must humiliate and crush Batman, first the spirit then the body.<br /><br />  In a perverse way, in \\"DK Rises\\" it was gratifying to see Batman/Wayne at the nadir of his fortunes and clawing his way back. Incrementally throughout \\"DK Rises\\" he loses just about everything - his precarious health, an initial, punishing tussle with Bane, his vast financial resources, his palatial home, and even his freedom as the battered ex-tycoon is flung into a cruel abyss with other wretches in a nameless wasteland.  As we find out, it was the same abyss the orphaned doppleganger Bane inhabited until he finally crawled out.  The abyss is cruel not only because of its depth, but also because it offers a tantalizing, Sisyphean route to freedom.  If you can scale the walls and make a dangerous leap to a ledge near the top, you are free.  If not, back you go, alive because ropes support you but demoralized.  Wayne has no Batsuit, no nothing.  Does HE HIMSELF, the man, have what it takes to escape and return to Gotham to save it. (SPOILER: After many agonizing trials and \\"Rocky\\"-style regimens, Wayne does escape that hell and return.)<br /><br />  Besides the personal physical strength, it was also gratifying to see Wayne's humanity come to the fore.  We learn that he fights crime not simply out of an emotional vendetta or to fill the empty time.  The orphaned Wayne has always cared for the downtrodden - especially other orphans.  He sees to it that the orphanage he has self-pityingly neglected for so long gets renewed funding.

B007ZXK08C|2.0|The book was much too long.  It was like reading a who dunnit, badly written piece of fiction.<br />The only reason I finished the book is that I never put down a book halfway through hoping that<br />something will change.
B000NA28I4|5.0|Eragon is a great book, but this movie is great because it has Awesome adventures with Dragons and brave boy who fights evil.

B008HI7BMW|4.0|Great music for the final Christopher Nolan \\"Batman\\" film. Hans Zimmer's score is dark, moody and thrilling. If you enjoy Zimmer's work, give this a listen.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|I've been a fan of Steve's music since his Zappa days. The Story of Light does not disappoint. An amazing guitar musician! :-)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It's a great read, well written, good stories, and some neat behind the scenes looks at  the development of products that we grew up with.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Here Dawkins presents one of the best intelligent presentations of atheism and belief. He offers a well designed argumentation and very complete overview of our position as atheists. This book is a must if you are a beginner in atheism or want to enjoy Dawkins quality of reasoning because, oh yeah! He really knows what he is talking about!. This book is also a must for believers, because here you will find what we really think, and not what religious indoctrinators make you think we say. He is direct and non-compromising, he is loyal in his reasoning and sincere in the presentation of ideas. Great book!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie.  Have never read any of the books and that probably would have helped understand the whole premise and reason for the districts, since the movie never really went into the background of the why's and wherefore's of the plot.<br />Great special effects and clarity in Blu-Ray version.<br />Have finally switched to buying more and more Blu-Ray that DVD versions of movies.<br />Will get the next installment of the Hunger Games if it ever comes out...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books were captivating, I purchase book 1 then without pause book 2-3 and the story was engrossing, a must read
B008602KQI|5.0|I was very surprised at how good this movie is.  Not too many movies that are based on books turn out this well.  While the book is better the movie doesn't disappoint those who have already read the book.  [[ASIN:1407136542 Hunger Games Original Trilogy Box Set]] While the books are listed as a title for Young Adults they're a good read for teens & adults of all ages and the same is true for the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is an absolute blast. Very simple concept; jetpack over and around \\"zappers\\", but the missions that you are given is what (in my opinion) make this game so much fun. I've been playing this game for about 3 weeks now and I must say that in that time I've played just about every day, not something I can say about my other mobile games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Who ARE these people and who is pulling the strings? This is a fun rollercoaster ride of a story.  Everytime I thought I was getting a handle on what was happening there was a curve to the rail and we were headed another direction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the books, unique ideas but a true good vs. evil which makes you want to read the entire trilogy.  Another great read for my Kindle.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Entertaining for adults on an evening to relax. It is not a 'block-buster' , but keeps you interested.  Plenty of action in my opinion.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Jojo Moyes never disappoints and this book is a point in case. Well written and easy to read and heart warming. This book is one you will enjoy what ever your mood.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I just love the varieties of relaxing sounds.I have trouble sleeping, so I just put my earphones on with one of sounds and I fall right to sleep.KUDOs to this product.
B000GFLEJA|1.0|The HD/DVD would not play in the DVD player.  Will return DVD to Amazon for an exchange for a non-HD/DVD of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is not a genre I usually read and I was quite reluctant to start the trilogy.Only the fact that a movie was made of the story made me read it.<br />What a pleasant surprise!<br />The story starts off nice and quickly,immediately pulling you into that world.A place and character (Catniss) you are soon familiar with.Such a fresh scene and an easy read.A very nice change and escape.<br />I could't put down the Hunger games when it came to the last 5 or so chapters!<br />I immediately ordered the second book.(that carried on a bit at a stage,but not discussed here)<br />I have to say,however,that it is an easy read and should be read for easy entertainment.Readers shouldn't expect a lot of intrique and a complex or challenging plot.Also maybe just for the ladies and teens.<br />I enjoyed it a lot and am glad I read it.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|The Gaslight Anthem is amazing. Not only is this album absolutely incredible, but every album since Sink or Swim is top of my list.
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|I thought this was a very entertaining book. It kept my attention, but obviously much of this book was made up, and the parts that were true were probably highly exaggerated.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|In selecting this book, I thought it would be just a pleasant read.  To my surprise, I found it to be much more profound.  The back story propelled the immediate action of the hike and left this reader pondering her own life experiences.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Each new release from train is more and more enjoyable.  The tracks from California 37 are perfect for parties.  There are plenty of great fast and slow dance titles to choose from.  I attended the concert tour and it just emphasized the energy that train continues to put out for their fans.  Keep them coming.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was very absorbing, will keep you wide awake, and also provides some hope for the future generations.  After great strife, the main characters survive, and do so on their own merits.  Wonderful to watch!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I was disappointed by the movie. I felt that it left a lot out that was in the book version. Perhaps if I had not previously read the book, l would have enjoyed the movie more.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A fun and quick game that's very addicting. I can't stop playing. I tried the sample and had to buy the full version.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Sometimes mine unfollows people with no action from me. I do like it and will not be getting rid of it because of the irritation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read a book that my attention span let me finish. THIS BOOK was beyond good! THIS BOOK will suck you in and you will not be able to put it down......and when it's over......you'll actually be sad about it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good conclusion to the Hunger Games story. The author continued to explain the story in such a manner as to allow the reader to visualize the events of the saga.<br />A very fun read that makes you want to research other works of the author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never read a book that my attention span let me finish.  THIS BOOK was beyond good!  THIS BOOK will suck you in and you will not be able to put it down......and when it's over......you'll actually be sad about it.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I would not call myself a big Sinatra fan, but I enjoyed listening to this immensely during a recent long road trip.  The recording (excellent live audio) captures Sinatra as an entertainer, just as much as a singer. Classic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book that my attention span let me finish. THIS BOOK was beyond good! THIS BOOK will suck you in and you will not be able to put it down......and when it's over......you'll actually be sad about it.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|Being a long-time DCD fan, I've anxiously awaited this new offering ever since seeing them live at the Warner Theater in DC in 1996.  Each of their albums has had a rich, unique magical quality and one can usually tell which album a particular song comes from if only from the \\"feel\\" it arouses.  'Spiritchaser' had a feel of endless twilight, a lullaby that takes the listener to the stars in the never-ending dusk, but Anastasis has a sense of the eyes slowly opening to a new day, even though the sense of foreboding and decay is still as ever-present as usual.  The instrumentation hearkens to Perry's most-recent solo outing, and in fact I mix in 'Utopia' in my playlist and it fits in almost seamlessly.  While what he says about this album is true, in that it combines elements of almost all their previous albums, that's not always the best thing to admit to, as it can imply a mish-mash in an attempt to regenerate the muse that animates, but the continual mining of the Phrygian scale (or Freygish, or Ahava Rabbah, etc) for the exotic and mystical qualities ensures that anything DCD puts out is guaranteed to transport the listener to those realms we humans most need to visit, if only on occasion.  \\"Kiko\\" and \\"Opium\\" are my two favorites on this collection, but as always, it's virtually impossible to separate a song or 2 - they all need to be experienced collectively.  With 'Anastasis', DCD once again prove themselves to be among the top tier of modern-day musicians and well worth every penny.
B008602KQI|4.0|Much like the book, the original idea of the game seems a copy almost total of Japanese film Battle Royale, but that is the fault of the author of the books, not the movie producers. Any complaints about the blu-ray.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was such as fast paced read I didn't want to stop - and I say that about very few books.  Surprising end too!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the best set of books I have read since Twilight.  I was skeptical to read the book because BDSM doesn't really appeal to me, but this book was recommended by a friend and I'm glad I read it!  It was so much more than I expected!  The psychological push and pull of Christian and Anastasia's dynamic and the twists and turns in the story left me breathless!  E.L. James is an awesome writer!  I was hooked until the very last page!
B00004R99I|4.0|Never saw this movie when it came out and now I can enjoy it with my granddaughter.  One of our favorites.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I do like the app, however, it force closes too much. I have to open it at least 3 times before it works properly. once its open it runs very smoothly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For me, this wasn't the type of book I would typically pick up, but it was on the best seller's list so I thought I'd give it a try. The book is split up into three parts and all of part one was an intense page turner. After that it was still a good read, the anticipation was just a little less. The book seemed a little predictable once reaching a certain point, but it was well written. I will say that it was semi disturbing, also. Overall, it was a good read and I would recommend it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was the 2nd book I read from this author and was drawn to this one because I really enjoyed the first book and the writting style and diary/shifting narrarator style - it not new but refreshing.  The story had me guessing throughout and wanting more information faster.  I had trouble putting it down and had to read one more page, then another.  I would recommend as an entertaining easy read.
B008EG700U|4.0|Sometimes MWAS feels an album warrants a more personal approach to the review and I will allow my guard to slip - I feel this latest release by Mr Lekman is such an instance, 'I Know what Love Isn't' happens to be a deeply heartfelt and brutally unflinching breakup album so why not admit that as I approach my mid thirties I find myself shuddering at the thought I might be the type of individual people could possibly refer to as 'unlucky in love' - perhaps this in turn leads me to have a deeper appreciation of this latest offering from Jens than those in the happily settled brigade? Who knows, all I'm sure of is this is a very tidy release that instead of choosing to compete with the songwriting tour de force that was 'Night Falls on Kortedala' decides to unswervingly focus on hitting that world weary, lovelorn sweet spot, basking in the bittersweet romance of heartbreak.<br /><br />Every song here contains at least one great line, whether Jens is describing the way guys cling to their girlfriends at rock gigs or listing the ways to spot you're in a relationship where one party is committing the worst crime of 'loving without loving' the lyrics remain steadfastly honest and subtly humorous throughout. The consistency in tone and writing quality make this album a joy to listen to in one sitting, the pacing is spot on with enough melodic detail and addictive choruses to make certain that attention never wavers.<br /><br />So Jens you're nursing a broken heart huh? I hear you brother, I hear you. As you put it all too well 'the world just shrugs its shoulders and keeps going' - that may well be the case but all I can say is this album elicits far more than a shrug from me, this is a beautiful work that will speak to many.
B00846REIS|2.0|it was a very bad copy cat of fifty shades of grey...i would not waste my money on it.  i am sorry that i actually purchased this book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The first story is a bit difficult to me. Aterwards, the story went very well. I don't like the fake clumsyness of the third story, but maybe that's what the author tries to make us feel. The language of the sixth story was giving me a hard time, but once you figure out the pattern, it is actually quite fun to read.<br /><br />Through one of his character, David Mitchell raised a self-mockery-ish question about the book: revolutionary or gimmicky? I personaly don't think the book exactly revolutionary. We've seen similar things like this before. I don't think it is gimmicky either. The author might be carried away a bit with his own story-telling, but I feel he told the story from his heart, and I'm deeply moved by what happened to some of his characters.<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommend this novel. Not exactly that challenging as some people might say.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy playing because it is more enjoyable than realty TV. The game is much more challenging and relaxing than current running TV show reruns.
B00633W614|5.0|Great story with interesting characters. The story gives an interested insight in the culture and time of England. I look forward to reading the last episode of the Clifton Chronicles.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nothing overwhelming here, but nothing half-done, either. The controls, graphics, and difficulty progression are all very fluid. So to speak.
B007MOU6ZQ|5.0|This book really is an antidote to all the self-help gurus and their inane platitudes.  At the same time it's a great look at life and all its foibles for those with intelligence and commonsense.  Never dull and full of insights, this is a fresh new look at human nature for all of us. I loved every word of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great! I've had it need to be forced closed on my Kindle Fire a few times but it comes right back up just fine. Not really a problem!
0440242401|5.0|I read this very quickly which is unlike most of the books I read.  Very light and fun.  If you're looking for some great classic literature, keep looking but if you want good chick-lit this is for you.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app really give me so many choices in what I want to help me relax! It takes all the stress from the day away.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site. You can find anything you want here. I enjoy the travel pages and the recipes. I have tried several recipes and they are all wonderful. All my friends love this site too.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm still reading it but so far I find it very interesting. I'm looking forward to getting back to reading it and finding out why so many has said it's classified as \\"soft porn\\" because so far I don't find it that way. I would classify it as a forbidden love story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Funnest game EVAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! I play it all the time!!! :) great for all ages :) this game is cool. I like it a lot. Chicken.
B004ZNB12O|1.0|Enough already ok? How bout writing some new stuff? Or is David happy to keep it all to himself with his solo concerts? I love the band but not the direction its taking of late.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This type of game that really keeps a persons game working. Great for you to track how well you or some you loves mental ability is
B006ZAZ31U|1.0|Hundreds of books have been written on Seals and their extraordinary training methods and the standards beyond normal human being's sustenance level. This unfortunate Seal appears to be a Cow Boy than a Seal to throw away his life many a times before he lost it for ever.
B00355L2TU|4.0|it was okay I have did better workouts i get uninterested very easily and she doesn't make me want to even do her workout I rather have someone that motivates me and pushes me more. but I am still doing this workout because I bought it already it's been about 2 weeks and I do feel better but it just gets boring.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was surprised by the depth of this pilgrimage.  It touches on so many life issues in unique ways, from the mundane to the spiritual.  Late in the book I thought it became a bit heavy handed, however I commend the poetic abilities of the writer as well as the story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GREAT BOOK.  I haven't gotten to finish it yet, but it's wonderful so far!  I highly recommend this book, and I can't wait for the 6th one to be finished!
0857685848|5.0|This book collects virtually all of the best modern paleoartists into one spectacular volume.  *Every* heavy hitter is here, and they range from digital artists to black and white \\"point\\" drawings; the publisher must have worked awfully hard to get so many top-notch artists into one volume.  It is a definitive collection, and will probably remain THE definitive collection of paleoart for many years.  Not only are the artists all extremely skilled, they show considerable ingenuity in the scenarios they depict ... for example, two giant Quetzalcoatus defending their flamingo-like nest against a much smaller juvenile T. Rex.  And all the art is consistent with and informed by the best current paleontological research.  As mentioned by the other reviewer, the art is not limited to just dinosaurs, which is a plus, despite the title.  There are also prehistoric mammals, tetrapods, and such.<br /><br />If there is one negative, it's that you will probably have seen many of these images before, simply because this is a \\"greatest hits\\" package of paleoart.  Therefore if you have previously spent any time reading books on paleontology that include great artwork, then you will have run across a number of these images before this collection.  But there is so much content overall that you will surely have seen only a fraction of it.  Not only is the art great, but the text is very interesting as well.<br /><br />Fun fact:  The cover picture with the crocodilian attacking the T. Rex is epic (which you can see in the Amazon picture), but if you take off the dust jacket, there is also underneath a rather amazing image of two silver dinosaur skeletons battling against a black background, all done in very technical and precise anatomical detail.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|This book was such a great read. I was interested in the story line the entire time and finished it in two days!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It is a fairly good app to view weather in different locations. You can store your locations and all weather info will be downloaded. It is convenient. But for some reason, the application doesn't always update the weather information when you open it.<br /><br />For example, you checked the weather in the night. When you wake up next morning and open the app to what is the current temperature, the app just kept the last night's temperature and all other forecast. It can be frustrating some times.<br /><br />I'd suggest to put a forced refresh function in the app.
B007TMON8M|1.0|This faotd started off with many glowing 5-star reviews,  all of them.  Nothing negative whatsoever. Suspicious! Then some real reviews come out. Nothing but problems with this app, me included. Watch out.
B004UUKDNA|2.0|I almost gave this album just one star, but it's slightly better than that - only slightly. This sounds like a lot of the early 90s Brit-dance pop stuff and is neither original nor interesting. Don't see the attraction here.
B008478VE8|5.0|The Origin of the Species, probably the most important book of the 19th century in terms of thought leadership. Darwin was finally stimulated to write his book after Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a paper which outlined similar ideas to what eventually became known generically as \\"The theory of evolution\\". Darwins book drew upon various emerging distinct areas of science including geology, naturalism and animal breeding to develop a theory which was so revolutionary that he could not compel himself to publish until some 20 years after he had undertaken much of the initial field studies in the Southern Hemisphere. A work of genius, yet Darwin was also relatively modest and sought to co-publish his work with Wallace when he had discovered to true import of the work. Anybody reading this book I also recommend should read more about Wallace who in many ways has been forgotten by history. Just to set the scene although Darwin was a genius, he did have several advantages in terms of money and position in society. Wallace, on the other hand had had limited training as a surveyor prior to his travels in the southern hemisphere and did a great deal of his fieldwork inland working first in South America and then the far east. One could say that Wallaces achievements seem more remarkable because of this. However one could also say that Darwin was prevented from publishing his work precisely because of his high status because of what it meant in terms of religion and hierarchical systems. Whether you are a Darwin or a Wallace fan, now that these materials are available in such an accessible format I suggest to everyone to try and read them as much as possible and draw your own conclusions as the work of Darwin and Wallace have far-ranging consequences in the modern world and may be instrumental in us trying to understand who we are in the great scheme of things at the beginning of the 21st Century and beyond.
0062197258|4.0|This book is a thriller that starts out slowly. It is  about someone who has  a very bad case of OCD. It takes a while for the horror to unfold, but when it does, it takes off!  Cathy Bailey is the main character and things went really bad, really fast for her. INTO THE DARKEST CORNER was a  captivating story filled with intrigue, and horrible in all the right, scary ways.  If you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary, that will keep you turning pages, this is a book for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book! Very intriguing, and might help one boost your sex life a little bit. :) It still has a nice story line, which is a love story...but the ending is pretty predictable! But, still love it! Can't wait to read the second!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Bared to you is a romantic yet steamy novel. It ticked all the boxes for a great novel. I can't wait for the next Crossfire Novel! 5 Stars!
B007TMON8M|4.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I picked up this app while shopping at home depot this morning. mongo, my trailermate, wanted to pick up some wood to build a clubhouse on top of our trailer.  I let him play with this app while I paid. when we made it home mongo started on the blueprints immediately. he also started the building process without my oversight. when I saw the finished product I was astonished. he had made a replica of the taj mahal on top of my trailer. it was so ornate and he seemed to get each detail exactly right. I had to go inside of it and check it out. inside he had a working fountain and somehow put a ceiling fan in it I was truely amazed. then I leaned against the wall and it gave a little then a bit more. finally I could tell that building was going to come down. mongo decided not to use any studs while building this clubhouse so it. was nothing but a house of cards. it all came down just. as quickly as it. went up and to make matters worse the water from the fountain and the wait of the other building supplies weighed down the roof of my trailer until it collapsed. I have had to call mongos mom and ask that she puts. us up at the super8 motel until I get another trailer. at least we are getting free hbo while we are here
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie, although of course a bit different than the book. Looking forward to the next installment in the series!
B001390BWO|5.0|If you haven't seen this one yet check it out. Based on a true story and one of the best movies I've ever seen - don't miss it!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was incredible. The books were even better (as always). I cannot wait for the next of three movies. I do recommend reading the books however, first, or at least read \\"Hunger Games\\" before you see the movie. It makes the movie even better, because you will then know all that happens that is not depicted in the movie. In the movie, there was only a couple things that I noticed that had been changed as far how the books were written, and that is to do with the Mockingjay Pin presentation. I will not say more, as I do not want to issue a spoiler. It was only different, not enough to change the story. And Catnip had gray eyes in the book. No big deal. There were a few things I would have liked to see done differently, and would have liked to see more of certain characters, but all in all, I still give it five stars. Prim and Rue are so, so beautiful, and I really had hoped to see much more depiction of them, especially Rue, since she...well...again, I don't want to spoil it for others who have not seen/read the story.<br />And if any of you have become Suzanne Collins fans, you owe it to yourselves to read \\"The Underlander Chronicles.\\" Five books, starting with \\"Gregor The Overlander.\\" I will say no more.<br />God..Bless..You, Suzanne.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I am a big John Grisham fan, but \\"The Litagators\\" was disappointing for me. It starts out really good, but about half way through the book, it starts to drag and lose the spark that has always made Grisham's book page turners.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Without giving too much away...  the book is about a married couple.  The narrator changes from the husband to the wife with every passing section.  The wife goes missing and you think you know where the story is going to go, but then the middle of the book comes and... BAM.  Everything changes.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad everything changed because it definitely makes the story more interesting.  But I was prepared to read a thriller and this book is not my version of a thriller.  It keeps you on your toes a bit and there are parts of the story that have that build up effect, but the last section and ending is weird (for a lack of better words).<br /><br />This is a good read, but not really what I was expecting. And it didn't end up being one of those books I needed to read.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This has calculator has come in very handy.  It is much easier to see than the calculator on my cell phone.  Haven't had much time to use it, but it has been very helpful in the short time I have had it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I 100% recommend this book to anyone.  I guess it's considered young adult, but I'm in my late 20s and really, surprisingly, enjoyed it. I recommended this book to my mom, thinking she would like it and while she liked the writing, she couldn't get past the kids killing kids thing.  I get that point of view and I think a lot of older parents find it a tough read for that reason.  I didn't like the kids killing kids thing either, but I really liked the idea of a future world where there's one state that wants all the power and dictates how everyone else should live to keep that power.  There are great examples of propaganda and greed throughout the story.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I know books are horses for courses and not every book is for everyone but this has to be the worst written book I have ever read.  No substance, no story line and could be labelled as trash. I feel as though I should complete the book to see if there is a point to it but I have other tempting books waiting for me to read. Judy
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great novel, I couldn't put it down because I was just dying to know how it ends. The twist is unexpected and keeps you on your toes.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This app is great. ps3 graphics, great story plot, and over all dark feel. great if you want a fun, (and violent)  app.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I dropped this into my HP CP1525nw slot and it worked immediately.  The printer now says it has 384MB total (128MB built in + 256MB added). I can't believe HP wants to charge such a ridiculous amount for their own memory modules - presently more than 50 times (!!!) what I paid for the Kingston here on Amazon.
B008XG1X18|3.0|just eh.  can be better.  easier to pin but hard to see the images. in the quad format hurts my dyes.  yes I'm over 40.  lol
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was a really good book. I actually read it twice. Can't wait for the second one to be released in Oct.
0525953728|1.0|What gives this man the right? He openly dislikes the president who supervised this effort. His snyde remarks about the president and vice-president politicize something that should not be politicized. He admits that their instructions were NOT to assassinate Osama bin Laden. But then he talks callously about one of his team members shooting bin Laden when he lay on the ground unconscious. I believe that is NOT what they were asked to do. He admits that there are intelligence people who spent 5 years finding OBL. This man spent a couple of hours on this mission. He says disrespectful things like they sat on OBL's body. That is not what he was told to do. All through this book I felt disgusted by this man's bragging and swaggering. This author did not honor his oath to protect privacy of the workings of the SEALs. I'm a patriot, and I am disgusted by the spirit that this story was told in. The author says...one dead body is like any other. I never will believe that all Navy Seals are so callous, self-centered and self-important.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|This is my 7th Baldacci and although it is OK, it does not match up to the others.<br />A little laborious in places but good reading nonetheless.
B007TMON8M|1.0|Tried to download to Nexus 7 but got nothing.  Keeps saying it is already installed but clearly it is not one of the apps on my device.
B008602KQI|5.0|Did a great job of following the book.  Casting was spot on.  Visually it was a excellent interpitation from the book.  Can't wait for the second and third film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you haven't read this trilogy you have a lot of late night page turning to do if you are anything like me.  For a 1st time author it is great. I thought I knew a lot about sex but these books taught me a thing or two.  While reading these I went to a Pure Romance party and being currently un-attached to any one well need I say more. I bought a few toys. Ladies be prepared to be making your man happy!
B007SGM084|1.0|I honestly felt like I was reading porn.  I had the book deleted from my Kindle.  I'm not a prude, but this was over the edge for me.
B008VBYN80|4.0|They definitely want you to spend real cash but can be amusing in free mode. You just cant play constantly.
B00683JLXA|1.0|When you pull back at an angle to throw upward you cannot get any force before you go off the edge. When you go off of the edge it simply throws the cub whithout enough force to reach the target. It starts to limit your throws at something less than 45 degrees.  This is true on both my galaxy tab and my attain android phone.  I only played a couple of levels before I got frustrated and quit.
B00846REIS|3.0|I was told \\"If you loved Fifty Shades, then you should read Bared to You\\", and I did.  In a nutshell, there is no comparison.  The story moves too fast and the characters aren't well developed.  Also, there are too many similarities to Fifty Shades- it really doesn't take on a life of its own.  The sex scenes are hot but, for me, that's not enough to make it a really good read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent example of leadership and determination for our youth.  It teaches them that no matter how hard a situation my be, think hard strategically and you can conquer all odds.  Never give up on your goals.
0374275637|3.0|The beginning of this book was very interesting . The author was very good at telling the story of his interests and research on the subject. My problem with the book started around chapter 5 or 6 . It began to repeat itself over and over again using ever more complex examples. It started to read like a bad college textbook. Pretty sure the author is hoping that professors everywhere will put this on their syllabus as required reading.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter watched this movie at the theater and loved it! She couldn't wait to watch it again so she was very happy when I bought it for her. She's watched it at least 3 more times!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I absolutely love the tunnel system in this book.  Through the Caster tunnels the authors were able to create a whole new world and dimension to the story.  That being said, I did not like the story as much in the sequel.  The action seemed forced in several scenes and in some instances completely unnecessary.  This is the first book that I actually think will be a more interesting movie.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|I was shopping around the other day for a good movie that I had not seen, and I just happen to take a glance at this on the shelf, and I saw Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, that was enough for me right there, but then when I saw on the top 'A Ridley Scott Film' I just put it in my basket, because I just knew this would be good, I'm a big crime drama fan anyways, and when you see actors like this with a director like Ridley Scott, you just know.<br /><br />So I couldn't wait to watch it that night, popped it in, and right off I was hooked, I just don't want to play spoiler, so I will try not to go into to much detail, I will just give you an idea of what the story is about, and it is based on a true story which makes it even better for me.<br /><br />So the basic story is Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) grew up around a crime family, and he gets a connection with heroine in Vietnam (yes this takes place in the late 1960's and into the 1970's), and he basically smuggles tons of top grade heroine back from Vietnam in cargo planes, and sells it cheap around New York City, and because he has so much of it, and gets a good deal on it, he makes lots of money, but then Vietnam ends, so different risks have to be taken to still get the drug, and everything eventually goes wrong, thats all I will say.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe turn in excellent performances as they always do, and Ridley Scott does another fantastic job at capturing the moments, the music is generally 60's and 70's of course.<br /><br />So final word, if you like Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and are a fan of Ridley Scott, you must get this film, I bought it just because of the names involved and I like crime drama, and it exceeded my expectations, and I'm really fussy, 5/5 stars definetly!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book was fabulous. It was a real page turner. I could not wait to read the third book. I would highly recommend this series.
B0060AY85C|5.0|This beautiful book is so spare and clean...not an excessive word...it just reads like music.  The characters seep into your being and you understand them.  I thought this book was another Toni Morrison masterpiece.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is so good! It made me want to read the hunger games, and I hate reading. Plus this comes with two disc for extra stuff that is amazing
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I can't start this game unless I have lots of time because it is so addicting for me.  I am always trying to beat my own time. My only complaint is that it is difficult to exit.  I have to tap the exit arrow several times before it actually exits.  Otherwise, I love this game.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a well written book. Adventurous, suspenseful, thought provoking. The Movie... a far cry from the book. Too many changes from book to script changes the out come for the reader turned movie goer. The movie was hard to follow for someone who has never read the books. For those of us who read the books, it was such a deviation that it did not make any sense. For example, the books spent some time explaining the significance of the Mocking Jay pendant that Katniss wore, a parting gift from a \\"friend\\" in District 12. The movie shows Katniss \\"buying\\" the pin at the Hob. Later in the books we find out that the Pin was from one of Katniss's mothers' friends...who died in the arena...and brings even more meaning to the pin itself as a symbol of the struggle against the Capitol. Another  example of Hollywood making their own \\"interpretation\\" of the book is the song that Rue and Katniss share with the Mocking Jays in the Arena...it is very significant in the books and the writers of the script blow it off, not to mention the lack luster way the foley guys kind of blow it off in the sound department...Truly a sad adaptation of a really good book. I feel sorry for the actors involved, this movie could have been SOOOO much better.. and the sequels??? I am afraid to ask!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I have read the trilogy and this is in my opinion this the only one that actually has a story apart from  that two stars for the series
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Watched this with my husband and son and we all liked it but not the best movie we've seen. I'd recommend it for fun!
B008602KQI|3.0|Unfortunately, I read the books before I bought the movie. The movie skips over a lot of background that I feel was important in building the story. If I had not read the books I would have enjoyed the movie more.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|i really enjoyed the movie but i must say the best one for me was still the first so if you havent watched all of them yet you still have something to look forward to.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The external journey was interesting but the internal journey was what was so compelling.  And believable.  Two thumbs up!!
B007P7UF06|5.0|When I saw the ad for the Camelot DVD, I was reminded of the wonderful music and beautiful scenery of the movie I had seen over 30 years ago. I assumed when I ordered it that the picture would not be very clear, as it is an older film, so I thought ordering it in Blu-ray would improve it a little. What a pleasant surprise as I watched the Blu-ray copy which provides a wonderful, clear picture! It is hard to believe this is not a current movie!
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|This collector's edition of \\"Black Rain\\", exceeded my expectations.  I have always loved this movie, partly because I am Japanese, and it show off lots of cultural practices, and secondly because the cast is phenomenal!!!  This is a good alternative from the usual American type gangster movie.  A great insight into Japanese culture.  A real heart pounding thriller.  Great for a cold rainy winter night!!!<br />Carolyn Gleeson
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the game. its fun and I love that there are so many different games to play. everyone should definitely download this app
0792838912|5.0|One of the classics. I purchased this movie, because, one I didn't have it and two one of my girlfriends, aged 50 have not ever seen it.  It's the consumate erotic love story.  I couldn't believe that she had not seen it.  So it was for education purposes, that I purchased it.  Just kidding, of course.  It's shot well, the casting is fantastic, and the lighting is fabulous.  Even the fashion of the day is represented and the movie is still timeless!!  Kim Basinger at her sexy best, beautiful, vulnerable, and real.  Mickey Rourke, very handsome, before he went under the surgeon's knife.  A very good performance. It was kind of the \\"50 Shades\\" for the 80's.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is the one you have been longing for if you (1) are stressed and want a calming escape, (2) need to push the &quot;reset&quot; button on your contentment meter, and (3) you need a relaxing and mentally stimulating smile break.  You will literally temporarily forget whatever stress is plagueing you when you solve the levels in this game.  if an app can restore personal peace and well being in the midst of stress, you should try this app to see for yourself how good it is.
B00407PNY2|5.0|What can I say about Bullitt, one of the best Steve McQueen movies of all time.  I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all.  Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!!  Especially because it was set in San Francisco, what a place for a car chase.  The next best is our modern day \\"Ronin\\", but that's a different kind of chase.  It's set in Europe, where the street are super narrow.  This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.  So if by chance you've missed it, it needs to go on  your must see list.<br />Carolyn Gleeson- Lover of Steve McQueen movies in any form.  In fact if you like Steve, see his motorcycle documentary,\\"On any Sunday\\". Unbelievable!!!
B007ZXQNGA|5.0|I have to say that this book was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />It is easy to read and provides the motivation to go forward, but those are just side benefits. I found the book kept me focused on the basics I need in my business, and reminded me of a number of things that I should be doing or should know better than be doing.<br /><br />I had been looking at my business in a traditional way, and I credit this book with my mindshift to a \\"microbusiness\\" which I can get up and running quickly, and take it from there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this game. play it to kill time while waiting around at the doctors office or auto shop. every time you unlock something new the fun starts all over.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Great movie. Love the singing and music. My 2 and 4 yr olds watched through the entire show. I also love Horton hears a Who.
B000S5C02S|4.0|This is a great collection and a great price. The Pixies have inspired many artists and are very easy to get hooked on. Definitely a collection you want to have.
1476712042|5.0|It took only took a few pages and I wasn't able to put the book down.  Didn't sleep all night.  I had to keep turning the page to see what happened next.  I will read this book again.
1612930425|5.0|WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT A CLASSIC.  I LOVE THE LANGUAGE, THE MANNERS AND THE RULES OF SOCIAL LIFE.  IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S SOCIETY THAT IT'S LIKE VISITING A FOREIGN COUNTRY IN ANOTHER AGE WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT.  A GOOD GETAWAY FROM NORMALITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|It looks like Stephen King is waxing nostalgic in this tale. He takes on the Man by flashing him the middle finger in a very...uh...big way. You won't put this down until the last page, believe me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book kept you very interested in the story line of the book. The book was exciting and was kept on the edge of my seat. I did not want to put the book down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book.  It's a great story about two very different people who care deeply for one another and try to meet in the middle to make their relationship work.  It's so much more than just a racy, R-rated story... E.L. James makes you feel for both characters, and instead of rooting for one or the other, you find yourself rooting for them as a couple.  I strongly recommend this book...you won't be able to put it down!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|If you enjoy action and wit intertwined together with a twist of comedy I think you will find this movie very entertaining.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Loving this trilogy.  This book backs off on the sex and explores more fully, the dynamic, the communication and trust developing between Christian and Anastasia.  It is a page turner, and I am easily pleased. I love the mix or fairy tale, romance, dark sides, psychology and relationship and can't wait for the next book.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie kept to the original story and the casting of the characters was good.  Can't wait for the next movie in the series.
B001X0ZKM4|5.0|This Movie has:<br />Tim Burton being surreal to the extent that the movie is more like a comic book that came alive.<br />tonnes of quotable highly awkward material performed by Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken and Michelle Pfeiffer.<br />countless hyperbolic examples of why the early 90's was one of the most disgusting times in history.<br /><br />If you have a campy movie night this should probably be on your list.
B0090EIILU|4.0|I really like this movie ,is funny an make laugh the hill time i was watching it,I really recommend it
B007URVZJ6|5.0|My dream is to have my own book on Kindle's shelf one day. And this 'Building Your Book for Kindle'make my dream come true.<br />After reading this book I know how to proceed my dream and I also know how to do E-Book correctly by MS Word that I never have knowledge about it before.<br /><br />Thks so much for all knowledges and chance to have book on Amazon.<br /><br />Veerachai
B008602KQI|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so much we saw it twice in the theater.  When it was available on DVD we got the package with the instant video, DVD, and the digital rights.  I love that I can now play the movie on my computer and other devices. The setup for the digital rights was a little tricky but well worth it.  You even get an extra movie if it is your first Vudu (the service) movie.
0307887448|4.0|Just really loved it - so much fun, just kept turning the page - and I couldn't stop! The characters are fine, they can't be that deep as you'll find out quickly because of the OASIS, but that frees the reader to just enjoy the pop-geek references, action and boom-boom-boom story line.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|In an era where being the hare gets praise (quick to the finish line), it's good to see how being a steady tortoise can pay off. Like a master artist, Jiro has developed perfection. He has mastered the act of creating amazing sushi over time and many practices. Always striving for better and never being satisfied. Of course to every passion/dedication there is a price like not being a present father and husband. I don't think leaving a legacy is worth losing time with your family. Each of us need to make our own path. Jiro certainly did. I thought the film was subtle and quiet but delivered the complexity and depth like Jiro's sushi.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that I know I will never be able to experience his amazing sushi.
B0015RDGD0|5.0|I'm quite satisfied with this purchase, my first using the Amazon video surface.  I purchased it online and originally played it on my iPad, but subsequently purchased an Apple TV to use and the movie is even better on my HDTV.  Love it!
B008ENNXQI|2.0|So boring. I can't believe I watch the whole thing. Stupid need to finish stories. Ugghhh. TV show \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is infinitely better. Sad.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I purchased this book at the recommendation of my physician. She told me that it was very \\"scientific\\" but that I would certainly be able to follow the major points with ease. The information is compelling, straight-forward and unconventional - but it makes perfect sense. I highly recommend this purchase.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|I saw this film on HBO and was enthralled by the drama, the possibiity, and the fear of this machine of death. This was a machine of death for it's goal would accept nothing less than termination of the life of the young lady it had been programed to end. A nail biter till the end of this science fiction drama. I highly reccomend!
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I liked this movie because of the dancing.  I'm always amazed at the talent and stamina people have to dance.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love these books! They're very intriguing and unpredictable, a real page turner because you just can't wait to know what happens next. Very developed multi layered characters that inspire you to love/hate/ pity them and really feel as though you know them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a must have app. I truly enjoy it. Love to spend my free time getting lost in all my &quot;interest&quot;
B005V2S7FW|5.0|last pass is a great system I have used this for quite some time although I do keep I.D. & pass words saved in a special folder on a thumb drive for the extra assurance.. but my beef is that when I installed it on my KF it had a 14 day trial which requires you to upgrade, but with a PC it is free. they inform you that all your data is saved and available but it will not log you on to your sites, it will take you there but you have to fill in you ID/Pw.<br /><br />so I feel that if it's free for a PC it should be the same for an android device.
B00355L2TU|5.0|As hard as it was first starting this workout (level 1) I felt discouraged and tried to find things not to like about this video. It kicked my ass but I kept with it and it got easier each time. I progressed to the next level and so on. Highly reccomend it, very convenient and really there is not a thing I can say I don't like, except for sweat.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you're a fan of Pinterest on your computer, you'll really enjoy it on your Kindle, too!  It's easy to navigate through the site and to pin from other sites.  I use it on my Kindle as often as I do on my PC.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I bought the book to see what all the hype was about and was surprised that there was actually a good story behind it, although I did find towards the end I was actually skipping through sections just to find out what happens. It ends so that you will have to go on to buy the next book in the series to find out what happens.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's the kind that keeps you in suspense. You get attached to the characters and don't want it to end
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Fantastic!!! Have watched it several times and loved it each time.  I very rarely buy DVD's; so this was a departure for me, but worth every penny.
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazon Hunger Games DVD<br />Like other readers I was anxious to see Hunger Games movie successfully dramatize the story and yet stay true to the underlying message. It does so with really excellent almost ironic visual reproduction of the text. Looking forward to the next installment.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This dvd is awesome. I didn't get to see the last 2 episodes so I was very excited to see this season come out on dvd.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found the book fascinating as it bounced from one person's view to another. It kept my interest and I wanted to find out what was going to happen.  The ending was a bit disappointing but all-in-all it was a great novel.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|I went into this with no expectations.  So many military-themed movies have no plot and are all action.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I don't remember the last time I gave a movie 5 stars.  Integrity, honor, courage.  Truly a movie representative of these great human beings.  Hollywood, please take note!
B003WKLOTQ|5.0|The movie was very good. Every new mom needs to watch it.  It will show the moms how different cultures are in their countries.  Its very interesting.
B008JAGG38|5.0|See this movie it was hilarious! Great seeing the cast reunited. Finally Jim's dad get's to cut loose. Love the fun little twist with Finch's mother.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|Great recording, love the singers, so deep and emotional. Wish I had bought two since I can't get it awayfrom daughter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this Bible because it has so many different versions in it. I like the fact that you can listen to it as well as read it. I am still getting familiar with all the options that are available but so far it's great.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I really loved this movie!!! It's the best movie in the trilogy and the best Superhero movie of all time! It was worth the 4 year wait and I can't wait to get this when it comes out on Blu-ray! I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theatres and it's the only movie I have ever saw at the theatres more than once! This is now my most favorite movie of all time with The Dark Knight being my close second! The Dark Knight Rises is the perfect conclusion to the best trilogy of all time!! The Dark Knight Rises is by far the best movie of 2012!! It was so freaking awesome!!!
0439023521|5.0|This book is excellent.  Riveting story, great characters, compelling, wonderful pacing.<br /><br />My daughter made me read it...because she loved it.  I loved it too.  Forget the hype...this book is storytelling at its best.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it.  The story lines were interesting and did hold my attention, but the graphic sex scenes got really repetitive in the second and third book.  In many respects, it was pretty predictable once you got about half way through the first book.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Last year, I've bought Zero Day. While that one was a great read, I think it had one small issue: it was kind of too technical. While doing a great job explaining everything, it didn't always add value to the story. Trojan Horse, book number two, absolutely fixed that. While some technicalities are in there (making for more realism), this book is focused for 100% on story and plot building.<br /><br />A surprising plot, a lot of action, suspense, interwoven stories and a fast pace make this one I sincerely hope someone will write a script on and make a movie of it. Great job Mark!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved it, pure and simple. I have recommended it to everyone I know. Best book I've read since The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I found this book a little difficult to get into, but once past the first couple of chapters it was hard to put down. The book was well written, and had an ending I wasn't expecting.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|After searching for cheaper alternatives, I settled on the Neo-Flex as a result of its telescoping abilities and overall flexibility. The unit (now installed) is far sturdier than expected, both in terms of the construction material itself and joints, screws, etc. The unit did not fit on my desk out of the box (my desk has a thick edge), but I was able to overcome this by inverting the bottom mount.<br /><br />Overall: highly recommended product if you're looking for a quality, flexible monitor stand.
1451627297|5.0|I don't usually read sci-fi books but have wanted to read this book since I first heard about it.  I waited until I could get it used and not so expensive.  It is entertaining, easy to read and really keeps you interested.  It is a big book, about 800 pages, but it goes quickly.  I enjoyed it very much.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say I loved this trilogy.  I'm betting most of the naysayers didn't read it all - which in my opinion puts Book 1 in a much different/better perspective after 'all is explained'.  Or, there are a lot of people that are just plain offended by sex scenes - which there are a lot of.  That's fine - but it doesn't mean the book is bad - just not your cup of tea (English Breakfast Tea?).  For the most part, the sex scenes aren't just thrown in there for the fun of it like a lot of 'romances' but they serve a purpose in defining the relationship.  It's a big part of the nature of the story when you take Christian's history into account.  I actually re-read the whole trilogy again right after I finished and I have to say I skimmed through the sex scenes - because that is not what this book is all about!  The emails throughout had me laughing out loud (love it when a book can do that).  A lot of people referred to the book as 'juvenile' - are they keeping in mind that the main characters are 21 and 27? Commit to the whole trilogy and then decide.
0307279189|5.0|What doesn't this book have in it? A remote part of Mexico, ultra distance runners, evolution, hunters in the African desert, the sciences, a math professor discovers secrets of running ... and it goes on from there. The book mainly focuses on a tribe of people, the Tarahumara Indians, in the Copper Canyon in Mexico. They are a rumor at times and then there is a bigger myth in the running world - Caballo Blanco (White Horse). He is rumored to be an American, but rarely seen in the Copper Canyons. McDougall does a very good job of connecting all these characters, rumors, incredible feats and mysticism all into one book less than three hundred pages. The wildest people and craziest feats are featured, but the story comes back to the Tarahumara Indians  with the best ultra-distance runners in the world coming together for one race. \\"Born\\" has a wonderful  perspective on the spiritual side of running, and one of the wilder characters, hard- partying babe Jenn Shelton says it all, \\"Running makes me a better person.\\"  The Tarahumara seem to realize this centuries ago and pass it on down through the generations. \\"Born\\" is not like any book you have ever read before. It is amazing  how McDougall fits  a wide range of items, characters, religions, sciences and races into a neat little package and brings it all together at the end. A must read even for the non-runner.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw The Hunger Games movie, and i HAD to know what would happen next. As this is a young adult (?) book series, i didn't expect it to be any more than slightly entertaining, but i was wrong. the book is well written, and kept me wanting to read more. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie or has read the first book in the series!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Is good, I liked it but have not read the books. I don't care for the cheesy futuristic wardrobes but that's neither here nor there.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I love this movie and so does my 2 year old son. He was sick recently and it had him giggling and cheering for the toys despite not feeling well.. love the characters and storyline. All around awesome movie
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Alright, I admit that the first time I watched this it was a typical Disney movie product...they even managed to get the 'passing intestinal gas' scene, which Disney seems to have made its trademark.  I wondered who the movie was targeted for...kids, teens, folks with nothing to do on a Friday night?  Well never mind that now.  I have watched this a second and third time and it got better.  Disney picked the wrong actor to be John Carter...he was hard to believe all through the movie but Dejah Thoris was so on the money...looked the part and played the part believeably...well cast.  The animation-graphics were brilliant.  I believed I was on Barsoom...now with HD pics straight from the Mars Rover, Curiosity, it is so much like being there!  The essential up front characters were really pretty good like Woola, Sola and Tars Tarkus, Sab Than and the Therns... the story, the science fiction, it all worked to bring the movie to at least warp speed.  I have watched it in 2-D and 3-D and enjoyEd both versions.  Disney should have, could have had the 'formula' better batched for a sure fire box office hit if the 'right' actor had been cast for the John Carter role...and Disney would of had likely success with all five John Carter of Mars books turned into big screen IMAX 3-D adventures.  Another lead for the John Carter role is needed to make this work ...if it ever gets going again...it took a few Batmans to get the right one...the lead (Christian Bale) made Batman the Batman we wanted to see as did Ian McKellen for us in his portrayal of Gandalf...so brilliant!  That's the key...the lead gal and lead guy can and do make or break a movie.  When Andy Whitfield passed away last year, the Starz Spartucus series loss the lead who made it all work...Rome, Gladiators, etc.  The new Spartacus dosen't work for me.  Not to say Taylor Kitsch was all that bad as John Carter, he just didn't take the character and the movie where it needed to be taken to make it all work.  Anyway, with all that said, this movie is well worth buying for your home movie collection...well worth watching again...give it another go.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an awesome movie.  There is a lot of action and just enough of the weird stuff to keep you interested.  Very close to the book.  Nice job!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though this book is considered adolescent fiction, the plot and overall message is much more than that. The book is a modern day 1984 of sorts.
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC does good news.  I find their reporting more thorough than most other outlets. Their reporting is not just a salad of headlines but some fairly in depth investigation.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I would tell a friend and get him or her so they can play this game. I am delly good at it and I'm only doin this for cash on the game.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|While I have not yet played this game, my daughter loves this game completely. It is another enjoyable game to help pass time.
B007WOA1IS|5.0|Excellent. Clear, concise and very informative. It is very relevant to the modern traveller and describes an interesting variety of activities, eateries and accomodation, although I have no experience of any of the accomodation described.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Oh my God. I have been waiting for this. I didn't see it in the theater, but promised it as a gift to myself when it comes out on video. I love, love, love Channing Tat-yum!!!! ♡
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Beautiful ambient music, challenging levels, and seamless transitions between menus and levels. I'm blown away by how good this game is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the Hunger Games after seeing the movie.  So much of the storyline is clarified by details in the book.  I highly recommend it for an enjoyable read and consider it appropriate for anyone over 10.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought that this film was good just not excellent as I expected it to be.  I think they fell short on some of the character developement and especially the relationship between the two main characters seemed to lack developement and depth.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun!  Will really make you think outside of the box.  I suggest you download this one.  It's totally worth it.
0385751532|4.0|Nuisance period for one, the darkest lifetime for another. Small gesture for one, warm fulfilling meal for another. Fences between people from two different spaces; yet of the same world. Friendships that is natural yet somewhat unlikely. Great adventure for one; same fate for both.<br />Provoking, touching, brutal, innocence, all in this amazing story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I loved the way I was sucked into the \\"Fifty\\" Trilogy.  It was hard to put down.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game. I've always enjoyed these types of games like Bejeweled and then to create my own fish tank and take care of my fish makes it twice as fun.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It's OK, there is worst movies out there...every body says the book was better but, the movie is good it just didn't blow my mind! Was i entertained for the 2 hours? yes.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a cute game but is definitely for the younger crowd.  I won't be using it but I am sure the kids would love to play it.  Thanks, Amazon, for such great games available for Kindle Fire.
B008Y7GPY6|4.0|If you enjoy the nail-biting horror and helpless anxiety from watching Open Water and 127 Hours then this film is for you!  The difference is that this film begins at the very instant that the character realizes he has been buried alive. You are with him the whole entire time as he struggles to escape and discover why he is there.<br /><br />This movie was shot very well and Ryan Reynolds portrayed the natural emotions and frustrations that any human would face under these unbearable circumstances.  You feel like you are in the coffin with him!  Not for the faint of heart or claustrophobic!!!  You will have nightmares of being buried alive!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games book. The movie does not do the story justice. Suzanne Collins writes even better in Catching Fire to make you feel like you are right there with the characters. I am reading Mockingjay now and I would highly recommend this trilogy as a must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Dial in your moral compass and prepare for the ride of your life. This book will stay with me forever. Cleverly written and well developed. It felt like I was experiencing every twist and turn with Katniss. This is a must read for anyone young or old.
0545265355|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a genius! I absolutely love the story, the characters, everything. I purchased the paperback trilogy box set. I was under the impression it was going to be hardcover but once it arrived I couldn't care less if it was written on paper...love the story! Shipped from the UK, pretty speedy delivery considering.
B007SNMYNS|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book and giving the author a fair hearing on his theory.  While he points to endless medical facts and studies, i remian unconvinced that science is completely on his side.  There are likely opposing viewpoints and it would be more helpful to his argument if he surfaced some opposing views and countered those arguments with his own views.  Such a \\"debate\\" in narritive form would better allow readers to evaluate his proposition.  That said, if his theory is correct, this is one massive \\"big idea\\" for those of us even marginally at risk when we consume wheat products.
B007X3DQGM|5.0|Great resource for a variety of different crochet blocks.  Perfect for someone who wants to break away from the traditional granny square.
034580404X|5.0|ThIs is a great trilogy to read. Besides all the sex in depth the story line is really great. Been along time since I've read three books that quickly! You defiantly fall in love with Christian and Anastasia's characters. Now that I'm done reading them Imiss finding out what new is going on in their lives. Lol, like they are real or something!
B007TMON8M|5.0|This game is really fun. I was skeptical at first, but I am really enjoying it. It involves thinking too! Makes me feel like I could actually build something!
B008KW43TE|5.0|This Album is genius, no flaws. Frank Ocean is genius. and people who listen to his music are genius !
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I try not to watch too much reality tv but I heard this song on the basketball wives and it was not the whole song but what little I had heard I wanted to buy it. It's just real catchy and it sticks with you. Its not the type of music I typically listen to but it does have a beat to it.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Each one of the stories well written, 2 of them left me wanting more.  Not necessarily the fault of the writer, however, he was able to work majic with my imagination.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie excellently explains how Batman Began. The story line is captivating and the characters are awesome. I would recommend to all audience's.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|A great western with wonderful characters and acting.  Not my all time favorite but still great in its own right.<br /><br />Like it was on television, each disc contains separate video chapters sans the commercials.  I see no reason why they couldn't have edited the movie to be one long film rather than have to go to the next episode and re watch all the credits both beginning and end.<br /><br />The video transfer does not look like a transfer at all, I doubt if there was any remastering for blu ray but rather just a transcoding to the Blu Ray codec.  While I did not find it disturbing because the film itself engrosses you, there is doubtfully much difference between the standard DVD and the Blu Ray version.  There is a good deal of grain throughout the film and the soft color resolution convinces me that not much has been done with this film when they decided to go to Blu Ray.  Eventually, you don't notice the graininess but it is there.  There is a scene in the 3rd episode where there is a very long pan from right to left of the cattle herd.  This scene made me a bit dizzy with the blur and waviness of the pan; an example of the lack of effort that went into the remastering to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1, a lossy audio and most of it is across the front audio stage with very little of anything other than the music score being diverted to the rear channels.  When I did hear some discreet FX of the cattle mooing from the rears it actually surprised me as there had been so little throughout the film.<br /><br />Never the less, I am glad that I have this movie but would not necessarily recommend it vs the standard DVD version.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksroviding plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B001JI72AI|5.0|This movie is very inspiring and really demonstrates NASA's greatest success.  I highly reccomend this movie to anybody and everybody.  Great show!!
030758836X|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read recently. I finally got out of my young adult dytopian fiction hole and, boy, was it worth it. The chapters in this book go back and forth being told from the perspective of the husband and then the wife. Each chapter reveals its own mess of secrets which build throughout the novel until you just can't take it anymore. It's an emotional roller coaster.    The only small issue I had with the book was the end which I thought kind of fell a little flat. BUT at the same time, I've been thinking about it since I read those last few words. And that was three days ago. So I think it worked.    [...]
B005LFQRTC|5.0|My favorite episode of \\"The Six Million Dollar Man,\\" both back in the day and today, is \\"Day of the Robot.\\" And my favorite portion of it is Steve Austin's fight to the death against the robot (played by John Saxon) in the episode's climax. The filming of the battle in slow motion, the neat and weird sound effects, and the perfect accompanying music score made this, to me, the most marvelous and memorable piece of television in, and from, the 1970s.<br /><br />(One unintentionally humorous interlude occurs at the very beginning of the episode when a straining muscleman attempts to lift a massive but obviously fake barbell.)<br /><br />\\"Day of the Robot\\" is, of course, on this First Season DVD set. For that reason alone, I think the set is worth far more than the purchase price, and worthy of five stars.<br /><br />My only regret is that this set became available only fairly recently in the U.S., and that as a result I had to wait almost forty years to see this fantastic episode again.
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved the books, the movie lacks relationship development and her inner monologue would be great. But not too bad a film
B0063IH60K|2.0|when I got this app I was really playing solitaire a lot. I wanted to get it so I wouldn't have to go on the computer so much or play with real cards. when I got on the app it wasn't like the real game at all. you have to get out three cards in the deck so when I pressed the deck it only gave one card! you have<br /> to have three cards! I guess if you like games you can cheet on you would like it but I don't!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did like the book. Its a corny novel with lots of sexual content. I had to read it because I wanted to know what was the buss all around it. And it did give me some long coffe talks with my friends.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm new to these types of games but I thought this one was fun. Some things were pretty easy but others were more challenging. There were some hints too. Overall, it is a fun game.
1612930425|4.0|Well, I will be honest and say from the beginning that I did not enjoy 'Pride and Prejudice'. I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?<br /><br />Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.<br /><br />Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I loved the movie.It was inspiring,thought provoking and humorous at times. However,the rental said for 48 hours,I only got 24 hours.
B005I548B4|5.0|This is another fantastic book by Nicholas Sparks! It's got everything, love, drama, suspense and a beautiful story that will have you staying up way too late just to finish the chapter. Highly recommend this. One of the best yet.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I must have been looking in the young adult section when I found this book.  The end was not too hard to guess.<br />It is definitely Y.A.  Slammed started off slow and had a good finish. There<br />has to be better titles though.  It's not on my top list but it was pretty good.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Far more hilarious than I expected it to be.  Emma Stone will be around for a very long time.  Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Emma Stone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|IM ADDICTED. ALWAYS ON IT. FACEBOOK. PINTEREST. TUMBLR. ALL DAY EVERY DAY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR PINTEREST ON THE KIDLE FIRE. IT COMPLETES ME (:
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read some horrible reviews of this book but I just read it for myself and I really liked it.  There is no doubt that it is sexy, but I didn't think I was going to like it because of the direction I thought it was heading.  But there is a lot of sweetness and mystery and the ending had me tearing up.  This book had me wanting to know more about Christian's history and where the relationship between Christian and Ana is headed.  It goes from just an erotic novel to a book about a really disturbed person with a troubled past that you want to know more about.  I recommend reading!  I will be reading the next two books in the series.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was such a great movie I have it memorized and buy on amazOn so that u can whatch on your kindle fire

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I think all of us fans of the books were nervous to see how this film would be handled.  It did not disappoint.  Fantastic cast.  And obviously it was a great story.  Both the books and the film are MUST DOS
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this app is very nice. challenging but not so bad that you just quit. my ten year old really enjoys it also
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Fabulous just like the rest of his books! I laughed and cried just as I hoped I would when I bought it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you have read the first 2 books...then you already know what the hype is all about...no surprises! :)  Love the book, the characters and the storyline. Quick read!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Wow wow wow. Rush really hit the nail on the head with this one. Snakes and Arrows (their last record) was without a doubt a truly superb album, but this one is by far their best album in 20 years. Stand out track: BU2B (acronym for Brought Up To Believe?). This is one awesome concept album by the fab 3, thumbs up all the way. I'm sure this will go down as one of their landmark records. Crank it up!
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Terrific CD.  Nick Waterhouse is great!  I bought it for one song \\"Say I Wanna Know\\", which aired as the background music for a commercial. The rest of the CD is no disappointment.  Totally PHAT sound!  Get It!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story starts out a bit slow, but I kept on.  Each page got me more and more interested until now I can't put it down.  I still have about 25% to go, and I can't wait to learn who the bad person is.

B001L62REY|5.0|Best Film Not Nominated:  Last of the Mohicans.  Michael Mann has captured a magnificent portrayal of life in the American writer James Fenimore Cooper's Central Leatherstocking Region, cast in Glens Falls in upstate New York.<br />Winner of the year's Academy Award for Best Sound, this masterpiece deserved recognition for camera work; the sets and camera work give the feeling that you're really there-- right in the middle of the pristine mountains and ferocious fighting.<br />Actually beautifully shot in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina,  locations used include the mountains of North Carolina Appalachia, Chimney Rock Park and The Biltmore Estate.<br />The music score by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, who replaced the former midway through production, yields an abrupt creative shift, proving greater than the sum of its parts.<br />Jones' opening main theme is grippingly effective music here, capturing the mystery and primal wonder of Cooper's frontier milieu in ravishing detail.<br />Dougie Maclean's  \\"The Gael\\" or  \\"The Kiss\\"  - Last of the Mohicans Theme - is replayed with tremendous effect.<br />The story is familiar, and illuminated by particularly exceptional performances by Madeleine Stowe and Wes Studi.<br />In short, there is more praiseworthy than space to tell it...  Outstanding in so many ways, and hauntingly beautiful.

I'm trim, but have what might be called a small wheat \\"middle,\\" and borderline high cholesterol. Everyone in the family has a cholesterol problem, and it's been in the family for several generations.<br /><br />A friend asked what the recipes were. Like a fool I chose NOT too look at the recipes first, but diligently read through the whole book first.<br /><br />The logic propounded in this book sounds plausible, intelligent, and probably right (although there is no proof other than this author's...no unbiased double-blind scientific studies).<br /><br />However, to follow this diet, of eating absolutely nothing with wheat in it, is IMPOSSIBLE to implement. I would pretty much have to empty my cupboard, and hire a full-time shopper-cook! That rich I ain't.<br />And forget about eating out.

Wow, you say.<br />It goes on to relate that food science has spent 50 or so years of mucking around with the wheat chromosomes, ruining the original healthy wild wheat of thousands of years.<br /><br />It says that everything from wheat belly to arthritis, diabetes, heart attacks, stroke, allergy, and of course celiac disease, could be related to eating today's \\"modified\\" wheat.
