B007ZXK08C|5.0|A slow, unassuming beginning careering into a white-knuckled, butt-clenching ride and a comforting, yet uneasy landing that makes you yearn to go back to the beginning.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game definitely utilizes one's critical thinking skills. We are looking forward to the next chapter. Hope to see it soon! We would have given it a 5 except that it was too short.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I bought this game for my six-year-old, but it is so much fun that I seem to play it more than she. Great graphics and interesting, and not necessary to spend a lot of money to use and upgrade things in the game.
0425263916|3.0|I'm very disappointed with this book. I expected so much more from it because there were so many unanswered questions and issues with Bared to You that I thought would be answered here. Unfortunately this book spent more time repeating what readers already know rather than offering something new to keep the story going.<br /><br />Let's start with what went down for 2/3 of the book: sex. It was hot, no doubt about it. Day knows how to write sizzling intimate scenes but it drove me crazy when all they ever did was go at it like bunnies. They celebrate their love with sex. They resolve their fights with sex (not a very healthy solution by the way). They break up (sort of) then have sex after. They get back together, then they have sex. You get the point. They basically say anything they couldn't say (or at least what Gideon couldn't) with sex. I keep repeating the word it's starting to lose it's meaning. And the same thing happened while I was reading the book. The more they did it, the more pages I skipped. I needed something more from this book, some sort of progression in their relationship. It didn't help that the book started immediately where the 1st book left off. I hated reading about the same drama and knowing that everything took place in less than a couple of months. I know they're both damaged and they needed intimacy to express their feelings each other but could we speed things along here, please?<br /><br />What was interesting though were the last few chapters of the book where we're given a glimpse (it felt like just a glimpse) of the real story - what should've been the focal point of the book in the first place. I enjoyed the mystery, how everything tied together and how Gideon finally opened up. Seriously, that guy is so broken it takes a huge fight (usually one with Eva dramatically saying she's \\"done\\" and telling him to piss off) for him to open up and to share his past with Eva.<br /><br />The book ends with a very weird plot twist and yet another cliffhanger. I'm honestly having a hard time coming to terms with the unexpected turn of events. Okay, it wasn't so unexpected because I had an inkling which I forced one of my blogger friends to confirm. But it wasn't something I expected out of this novel. It brought the story into a whole new level because there's so much more at stake now. I'm interested to see how the story unfolds in the next one and how Gideon and Eva's relationship develops (really develop) this time around given the circumstances. All in all, it was okay. I didn't like it as much as Bared to You but I'm still looking forward to reading Entwined with You now.er cliffhanger.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game takes a bit of strategy and it can also be helpful to train for real horses. Although it's a process this is a great game.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|It is a different technique than others I had read before.  I am reading it again for better understanding and appliance on my running.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think it is a great game I truly like it. The app it's self really works well I haven't had any problems getting it to work. So if you like or even love spider solitar I would get this app!!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|These bands meld together nicely and they jam tight. I am always happy to hear new music from young artist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever. It is the most interesting than any other game I have ever played. Way better than Temple Run.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|It was unusual in that we heard the story from the horse's viewpoint. We tend to forgett the huge part horses played during WW1 and the debt we owed them, many perished. It was no credit to the Army that after the war was over the horses were left in France where it was well known the French ate horse meat. A great read.  A. Long.....
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I found this movie to be interesting,  You keep getting movies that are about the same scary stuff and this was a little different.  Nice little touch to the motherly instinct situation.  I am one of those people who gets scarred easily and after the first 45 minutes I got use to the scary moments.  So my screaming stopped but the worry of something about to jump out and get me was always there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the new subway augers Miami beacause they gave Jake and tricky new outfit and k just love this game and I will always love it
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Yeah, that's right. I was a hipster wannabie for about a week last August and I listened to this Album 24/7. I should have instead watched the videos since she is soooo cinematic. I think Mad Men really threw the hipster movement into overdrive, which is ironic since it's about a womanizing ad executive!!<br /><br />Somehow everything becomes more authentic with age.<br /><br />At least half of the songs on this album are great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is simple and fun, but still a considerable improvement over the first temple run. I liked the new obstacles and characters.
1476734941|5.0|Being truthful, I don't follow the plan exactly to the letter. But I am losing on average 2 pounds per week. By adopting the theory I don't feel like I am missing any food, i have more energy, and after a meal I am full but not stuffed.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This is a breathtaking book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. With every chapter your suspicion grows. The ending of every chapter makes you want to read more. This book is a must read.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I chose this book because it is interesting to me. I have always liked Greek mythology but reading it from a demigods point of view was really cool. I would encourage preteens to get this book.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|For the price it is fine, though it is a little slow if you need a fast charge this may not be good for you.<br />It works great if you just want to leave it plugged in when near an outlet.
B0081336FO|5.0|I enjoyed the interaction between Sherlock and Watson.  I also liked Watson's character portrayal.  At first I didn't know if I would like the series.  Because I have read a number of Holmes books, I think it is always tricky to appreciate someone else's adaptation of a book that you like.<br />I was very pleased to see that the adaptation was not skewed into someone else's idea of who the characters should be.<br />I was sad when I realized I had watched all of the available shows.  Hopefully, more will be available as I would love to see more!
B0067LY4WG|4.0|I happen to love Leonard Cohen, This is a pretty good recording, and a must have for those of you who are true fans.<br />He's still your man!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A must see!  I could not stop watching....from the first season I was hooked, great story, beautuful  costumes and scenery, supurb actors/acting.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have always enjoyed novels that combine history with fiction. Ken Follett is a master at this. While the story is hardly groundbreaking, well defined characters and paced writing makes this worth a read. It won't change your life, but doesn't have that goal. Great holiday read.
1466401885|5.0|I loved the book, in fact i have re read it like 3 times. I had my friend read it to and she loved it.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|Because there was no other film version, except the ancient one, I did like this. However, the breadth of spirit, soul and intent is absent from what Fitzgerald is doing in his novel Gatsby which the more I read it, is perhaps the finest American novel of the 20th century. The values of the novel are present and timeless; it is a work of genius. How do you capture that and bring it to film? Well, this version of Gatsby tried. Redford did what he could as did Farrow and the others I do like Sam Waterson, but his detached, unemotional Nick make no sense if you think about the fact that Nick HAS BEEN SO MOVED TO WRITE ABOUT GATSBY. I remember it didn't receive very good reviews, but a lot of hype for costumes and even decor. I remember  a sofa I looked (Macys) at was hyped as Gatsbyesque. The current film is breathtaking and for actually besting and nailing the novel, I do not think any film that I have seen does it like Lurhmann's version of Gatsby. Magnificent, phenomenal, music, art direction, costumes...so many specific details capture the time of the Roaring 20s and all of its hidden secrets related to Gatsby. Gatsby wears a pinky ring; can you tell what the decoration is and its significance? Every material detail is expertly designed and chosen. You must see the Baz Lurhmann film a few times because you will MISS ALL OF THE INNUENDOS, symbolism and threaded themes...you will miss the intense vision of the creators and great reverence for the novel and what it expresses (even to the point where he includes &#34;He knew his mind would never again be able to romp like the mind of God...&#34; WOW!!!  and then the shot of the s...an night sky and the Milky Way's brilliance...extremely significant theme of the novel...how at that point Gatsby limits his destiny by wedding it to Daisy...and he knows it...the tragedy of the novel) and be unable to appreciate how it all adheres into one beautiful rendering...a love letter to Fitzgerald's brilliant novel... a brilliant film. In no way did the 1970s version of Gatsby have the understanding of the novel, its significance, its beauty, its greatness. Lurhmann's and Martin's version IS Gatsby.lm. In no way did the 1970s version of Gatsby have the understanding of the novel, its significance, its beauty, its greatness. Lurhmann's and Martin's version IS Gatsby.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It was disappointing, especially since they are making a movie out of it. Also not for adult readers, really a teen book, maybe her others are better but I was not happy with it.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Nice mind game. I totally recommend this app if you like to work that thing that sits between your ears. You know your brain :)<br /><br />The app takes a few boards to get use to. But once you do then your good to go strain your brain.<br /><br />1 thing I do not like is the little totem dude popping up with some stupid message on every board PLEASE FIX, other than that I like it a bunch !!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I expected more focus on the civil war and more political views of Lincoln. I got a very good personal view of of him and how he governed with emotion and personal beliefs.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The forces of the dark one are gathered for a last push against the forces of light. Can the Dragon reborn hold together his fractious alliance, and keeping them fighting together long enough to win the last battle? Is Rand up to the challenge himself? What part will Matt and Perrin play? What of the dark tower? The Forsaken? Rand's lovers and his children?<br /><br />The Wheel of time saga has been a long ride, more than 10,000 epic pages. A strong start, an OK middle, and - happily - a strong finish.<br /><br />A Memory of Light isn't the best of the fourteen books, but it's not far off. It has a big job, tying together characters and threads from its thirteen previous books. Given the difficulty of the task, it succeeds admirably.<br /><br />If I bump into a fantasy fan who hasn't read Wheel of Time, I can unreservedly recommend it now, knowing that the saga has a solid end. Five stars for this book, and for the series as a whole!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I don't feel that you got enough coins to start and you keep having to buy more.  Not too fond pf gaming with other players.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book wasn't what I'd expected. Rather than a continuous narrative, it was instead a collection of experiences Kyle felt showed something, and that he could talk about. Early on he tells the reader that most of his missions are omitted from the book, for reasons of secrecy and national security. Fortunately, the stories which remain are interesting and illuminating.<br /><br />This is really a book about Chris Kyle. It talks a bit about his youth, his pre-navy days, and both his personal and military experiences. His wife Taya is also quoted in the book, talking about some of the struggles they face as a military spouse with a civilian wife.<br /><br />Things that really stuck out to me:<br />+ It helped me understand more about why someone might want to become a sniper, and how they can keep doing their job.<br />+ It showed the impact of the sort of personality that can do this work on the way they live the rest of their life<br />+ It brought home the idea of living in a war zone through his time in Iraq. I'd never really understood the chasm separating civilian expectations (this is my home, nobody comes in without knocking) from military reality. It's sobering.<br /><br />The book is well written. It was a bit different from what I expected, but well worth the time to read, and gave me plenty to think about.<br /><br />Great book!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|While I love this game, I too am a little disappointed by the amount of money it would take to finish the game. While I am not opposed to playing for years (I have been playing Farmerama for the last 4 years) I don't like to spin my wheels.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|This is one of those movies that...if you have seen the previews, you have seen the best of the movie. It was not as good as I expected it to be. There was a nice overall message though.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I have had this album since the day it came out and I am absolutely in love with it. It never gets old.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book gives an amazing insight into the thought processes of a person with Aspbergers without apology. It is a fascinating read.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie has lots of small bits that are fun and it calls to the &#34;kid&#34; in all of us.  The quality of the movie is perfect.  The delivery was quick.  I am happy to use this seller again in the future.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Sad to know I was reading the last of this long series.  In a way, was hoping for something more satisfying than the ending here.  Thanks for many hours of pleasure though, Charlaine.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|perfect perfect book definatly buy it is the best of the frst three in my opinion! really brought me into the story. i felt for the characters.. a.k.a it was great
B001QJUX24|5.0|The Searchers is a big movie.  Watching the majestic scenery is contrasted with the ever-present dirt and dust and grit of Monument Valley.  The movie speaks of racism, family, loyalty, persistence and the enduring power of love.  John Wayne and his ensemble cast, deliver classic movie action and dialogue, maybe a bit dated by today's standards, but I'm not a fan of today's standards.<br />Knowing that this was one of the Duke's favorite films only adds to the joy of watching it.  I watch it two or three times every year.  It is a great contrast to &#34;The Quiet Man&#34; but in many ways deals with some of the same tribal (clan) issues.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Reread this on Kindle as have lost paper version. Classic Picoult, great way to just fall into a story. recommend to anyone who enjoys her other books
B008PWN0I4|5.0|An excellent bluetooth transmitter I purchased for use with my Apple iPod Classic 160 GB - 6th Generation (which no generation model ever had bluetooth built-in) works great with headsets and speakers.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Ultimate Guitar Tabs takes all the tabs, search engine, and database of the website and adds some cool twists, like auto scroll, and the ability to zone in. You can also view chords and change the key right from the tab itself.<br /><br />It's clean and functional. I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.Very addicting can't put it down.But app won't update to the latest version and am still trying to figure it out?
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I have really been trying to into this story but the beginning is a little slow on the trigger for me....hoping it picks up soon.
B00CDGUOJQ|5.0|I've only made two of the recipes in this book so far, but I was told by non-vegan's that they were better than &#34;non&#34; vegan cupcakes. So, this cookbook gets a BIG thumbs up from me!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Makes good use of your brain.  Also great for eye/hand coordination.<br />It's always a little different every time you play it.
B00BXJZ07A|3.0|I missed them so much that I had to give this the third star, but other than the first track, which is classic Del-Lords, and the Neil Young cover closer - it's really pretty pedestrian soft rock. Previous reviewers cite a harder edge, and aggressive guitars - really? The album sounds to me like they recorded it while trying to not wake the neighbors. Nothing horrible, just not vintage blood and guts Del- Lords. I'm still thrilled to have them back, but I still miss them in a way too, if that makes sense. I appreciate the first three albums even more now.
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|With all the disappointing things in this movie (and sadly, there were plenty), the music is definitely not among them.  As a trekkie, I'm not a big fan of the reboot.  However, as a musician, I'm a big fan of the music.  Giacchino, whose Pixar and Lost scores are phenomenal, did an excellent job capturing the franchise in the first film and returns with a solid score here.<br /><br />The music itself is great, don't get me wrong, but what makes it better was how well it went with the movie.  An excellent example is &#34;London Calling&#34;.  The simple piano style music complements the tension on the screen.  This is a major moment in the movie (which won't be disclosed here) and the music helps enhance those moments in the movie.<br /><br />My main letdown with this score is the lack of originality.  Don't get me wrong.  I understand with a franchise you have recurring themes, but STID seemed to rely a little much on the 2009 film.  Giacchino has never disappointed in his films, but I found this one a little less than stellar for him.  There were moments that seemed to lack in the intensity I've come to expect from Giacchino.  An example involves when the antagonist and Kirk try to get to another ship.  While the music behind it is good, I didn't get the hair-raising feeling I got from &#34;London Calling&#34;.<br /><br />Giacchino is arguably the best composer to come out of the last decade.  His scores show they can move across games, movies, and television.  However, I was a little disappointed in this score.  Maybe I've come to expect a lot from him because he's set his bar so high recently, but I think instead he didn't really hit a home run with this one.  Felt more like a triple.  I'm not sad about my purchase or seeing the movie, but this does have me concerned as far as the direction Giacchino may be headed.  Here's hoping the rest of his films stay strong!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I have never played such a good game. I mean it has its times when it lags and freezes but it is still worth the money.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I discovered The Piano Guys years ago before they became huge.  I remember listening to them ever since and thoroughly enjoy how successful they've become.  They know how to provide great arrangements for some of the top pop songs out there now.  The way they can take songs like The Lord of the Rings suites or Begin Again and make redo them in a way that makes you hate the originals.  For example, I've never heard &#34;Begin Again&#34; by Taylor Swift and have no intention to since hearing The Piano Guys.  These guys not only know how to play, but also how to arrange.  My fiancee and I plan on using their music in our wedding and reception.  They make so modern music enjoyable and I fully look forward to the rest of what's to come!<br /><br />(I keep hoping they'll do &#34;Married Life&#34; from Up!)
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I always enjoy a good old school movie to get together with my war buds and enjoy the afternoon chilling....
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I still have trouble pairing Elementary and BBC's Sherlock on the same level. So, I will ignore Sherlock and suggest that YOU MUST WATCH THAT.<br /><br />With that being said, Elementary is amazing. John Lee Miller and Lucy Lu have great chemistry that improves throughout the first season. Where BBC's Sherlock explores Holmes amazing ability of deduction. Elementary places Holmes in the role of a recovering drug addict with Lucy Lu as his sober companion. Regardless of the traditional pitfalls of American TV, Elementary stands out. Miller's Sherlock becomes a character you can't seem to ignore and gasp at his eccentric behavior. Holmes would be a terrible roommate. The season is a full 20+ episodes so buckle in, your in for a surprisingly adventurous and dramatic television show.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The show is a spin off of Doctor Who, though one doesn't need to know anything about the Doctor until Jack says his name.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|this is absolutly the best thriller I have read in a long time  go for it you will not be able to put it down
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Now if someone would just make one of Mr. Timothy B. Schmit's life achievements I would be even happier! thanks!
B0055SWM08|5.0|love it, and love it more when I was lucky enough to get it free during a promo. very addicting.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Trust me when i say this game is amazing and a lot of fun..looking for a quick burst of gaming, thus is your game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is totally great!  The prospect of a male POV was intriguing and thought provoking.  I was laughing and crying throughout the entire book.  And the sex is HOT!
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|I thought it was very fun, but it can be better and even more fun. Overall, it is fun and exciting, and I would recommend it for everyone.
B002U6CJCE|5.0|I bought this movie thinking it was Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning.  I watched the trailer for it and as soon as I finished, I searched for it.  I was so happy that I THOUGHT this was it...I purchased it quickly.  When it came, I said...wait, this isn't the movie I thought it was.  I felt like an idiot.  So I contacted Amazon's customer service and said I purchased the wrong item.  They responded and said just keep it and we'll refund your money!  Although surprised for a second...I thought, how great is that!  I got to keep a movie (I really didn't want) and still get reimbursed.  Needless to say, this was in October of 2012 and the movie is still in the wrap.  The Universal Soldiers movies got pretty bad after the 3rd one and I haven't had any desire to watch any other ones after that, until I saw Day of Reckoning's trailer.  It's out on Blu Ray now, so it's time to finally get the one I've been wanting since last year!  Thanks for the great customer service, Amazon.  We do buy from them a lot, but I never expected such awesome service.
1616614609|5.0|This game really blew me away.<br /><br />Production value 5/5<br /><br />The production value and art for this game are top-notch. The art is very colorful and the tokens are made of thick card-stock. My only complaint is that the cards are a little frail and should be protected in order to ensure their longevity.<br /><br />Gameplay 5/5<br /><br />This is where the game really shines. Its all about bluffs, risks, and resource management. The resource management aspect of the game is almost perfect. You always limited in some way by either cards, actions or money so you have to make decisions very carefully. However, what really makes this game unique is the calculated risks and bluffs that go on during the game. You are always guessing what your opponent is up to.<br /><br />Almost every time I have played it has been very close. There are sometimes huge swings of momentum mid-game that keep the game interesting until the very end.The balance is nearly perfect. However, in high-level play the runner has a slight 5% advantage. This is still very close considering the highly asymmetrical nature of the game. Furthermore, future card releases will likely change this balance.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a card game so luck is a major element in every game. However, it is not always the determining element.<br /><br />Theme 5/5<br /><br />Everything about this game reflects its theme. The game-play, art and even terminology immerse you into the world of Android. If you are a fan of cyberpunk you will love the look and feel of this game.<br /><br />Learning Curve 3/5<br /><br />As stated in other reviews the learning curve for this game can be a little steep. However, the rulebook is well written and Fantasy Flight has a video tutorial on their website to help you get started. Once you understand the rules you will seldom open the rulebook ever again.<br /><br />Value 4/5<br /><br />The core set has a lot of play value on its own and for some it may even be enough. However, if you are like me you will want to expand the game as soon as possible. The game can get expensive since they release a new $15 pack of cards every month.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I thought I knew quite a bit about U.S. Presidents, but this is a story that never seemed to get much attention in the history books I read. I was amazed to learn of the amount of contact that has existed over the last six decades between a sitting president and his predecessors. It is refreshing to know that somebody in the political scene is able to rise above the political fray and act in a bipartisan fashion. Whenever a sitting president requests their advice or their help, the ex-presidents respond with advice in private and, if asked to support the president's policy publicly, they generally do that. Instances of a former president publicly criticizing the policies of the incumbent have been rare in modern times. They attribute that to the respect they have for the office they held and the empathy for the man in the Oval Office. Given the current stalemate in Congress and with the present administration, it is uplifting to know there are those who believe the good of the country comes first.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Well I had the vinyl album back around 1967. Then I got he first CD of it around 1986. Now this new and improved that seems to be made in Japan with the extra video seems to be a bit better than the 1986 version. Of course a DVD Audio in 5.1 or Super Audio to me would be surpurb! Maybe by 2016, lol.
B004TTHLBE|2.0|I suffered through 9/10 of this bizarre novel waiting for the author to finally get to the point. As I approached the last few chapters of the book, there was still no foreshadowing of a denouement. So I just stopped reading.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I absolutely devoured this book.  Cheryl's tale of becoming whole again gripped me from beginning to end.  I laughed -  I cried - I shared in her joys, sorrows and fears as she hiked solo on the Pacific Coast Trail. Most of all, I  was able to enjoy this daring adventure from the comfort of my own abode!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I never cared for this man, but when I found myself finally buying some Apple products and being impressed with them, I decided to learn about the man behind the name. Isaacson did a great job telling the story and I credit Steve Jobs for not trying to influence the author's final product. Jobs was an interesting man and Isaacson covers the gamut from genius to idiot and all the places in between. I found it a fascinating read.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I can't really explain it but I find this game really fun. Game play is basically just guiding your ship to target the enemy while avoiding any collisions. It draws you in and becomes ever more challenging. The only problem I have is the lack of a pause option, at least if there is one I can't find it. Definitely one of the better games I've downloaded for my Kindle Fire HD
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Freakishly awesome game very entertaining lots of action the web slinging is cool not gorey has lots of cool features great for any person who loves Spiderman .
142314189X|5.0|Does the treasure chest box come along when we order it? Or it just comes with the books in the vox
B00498YZFK|5.0|Great acting and characters particularly by J Lawrence. It has the feel of live coverage like a documentary. Very believable characters and great type casting. Chilling suspense with a sense of creepyness. Poor and desperate people living on the edge.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book really kept my attention.  I want more of the story.  The details and writing style had me feeling what the characters were feeling.  Great book!  Can't wait for more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another King masterpiece. I always love a quick trip back to Derry Maine, and how he's able to wind a bit of the his old characters into fresh new stories. A fantastic tale I had  a hard time putting down!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful film, enjoyed every moment of this film.  I would recommend this film to any one.  I believe this is a must see.
8415139136|5.0|It is a very nice way to learn more about the real life in big Bombay. Keeps you intrested all time.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|One of the best classics ever written, and a must read for all of our upcoming youth. One can learn much by listening to the the &#34;call of the wild.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. It is sord of like temple run but so much better. If I could I would rate this game with six stars but unfortunately there are only five so I will choose those five.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This product has been very entertaining and fun.  Not a big fan of the in game purchases though.  It really slows down the game.  I wish the map was bigger and did not need to be purchased.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I think it will be a nice game for 5 to 10. It also is the same company as Cut The Rope. It would be fun to play in the car or plane or any transpertation. It will keep your child or children busy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and is great for horse lovers! Downloading was a process, but was well worth it. It is a very fun game!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked this series - it was an easy read that went fast. I did not like how there were gaps of time that were not explained. Def a good summer/beach read!
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|This is the first hit for DAFT PUNK since Stronger by Kanye West.  What will come out of this group next?  I don't know.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|As an author (FINDING MY ESCAPE), I appreciate a game with a great story line.  This story was interesting and definitely kept my interest.  The graphics were impressive, the app easy to maneuver, and the games were 'just hard enough'.  GREAT afternoon of fun!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|This series is becoming tedious with too much time spent going into detail about the past books. Also the editing is poor with many mistakes throughout
B00CL0J99K|3.0|IM GOING TO TRY AND AVOID ANY SPOILERS HERE (((no promises though))). The first Iron man movie was just flat out awesome and a great start, the second movie was actually better than the first, the third movie was just a confusing mess. The CGI was awesome, the action was pretty good, but frankly i think the story line was a very, very weak point, I feel the writting was comical (pun intended). They could have came up with a simple (somebodys going to end the world plot) threw in a bunch of action and Iron man fighting ect ect, and the fans would have been happier.. But no, most of this movie was stark outside the suit. The vilian was not all that scary and I was not convinced in the added DNA powers etc..  The ending left alot to be desired to..  Im not going to buy this movie and add it to my collection as i know i wont view it knowing how lame the plot was..  Im sure there are comic faithfulls out there that think this latest installment was perfection and in the comic world they may be right, it may be following some old school story line.. but that doesnt improve my movie going experience. three stars for some cool CGI and thats about it.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I tried it out using the closest piece of paper I had, a letter that was tri-folded. I put it on my bed, didn't even flatten it all the way, and scanned it. I was really impressed, it compensated for the different angles of text and made everything look normal. No scratchy stray marks like on a regular camera image converted to b/w. It looked like a document ready to print.<br /><br />My son does school online and I was using my camera to send in his assignments because we don't have a scanner. This is so much better.<br /><br />And of COURSE you have to have a camera to use it, that just seemed like common sense to me. Amazon didn't HAVE to give a paid app for free every day, they do because they're awesome. If you can't use it, WAIT A DAY and check back tomorrow for the next one. There are more important things to worry about than missing a day of the free apps.
B002M87V0A|1.0|What an atrocious film.  Too long and an unmemorable score and (are you sitting down?)<br /><br />BUDDY HACKETT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Into the trash with this one.  Ugh.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a fun western in space. Takes place in the future after we have ruined earth and have terra formed earthlike planets. Mostly very primitive living without a great deal of modern technology. Looks a lot like the old wild west. Always fun!
B0019TSI8W|2.0|Streisand's character is a teacher at Columbia University.  So why is she living with her mother?<br /><br />Had this script materialized in 1970 or so, it would have been great.  But instead Streisand dons the \\"kooky\\" hat (in some scenes) and while she's still delightful at it, she's also older than we want her to be.  Why is she living with her mother?<br /><br />The incidental musical score is precisely what you would expect in a Streisand film: 100 violins, a saxaphone..........<br /><br />I wish Streisand would get away from the Jeff Bridges'/Nick Nolte's/Ryan O'Neal's/Robert Redford's kind of co-stars.  They are all blonde and handsome.<br /><br />Lets see her tear ass with Al Pacino.<br /><br />In 1970, the story would have been fun.  Now, decades later, it's stupid.  A woman this smart wouldn't fall prey to these insecurities.  Not at this stage of the game.<br /><br />Barbra is too beautiful now to play the ugly duckling yenta but she gives it her best directorial shot.  It's not a good film.<br /><br />For all of Streisand's high-falutin' ways and theories, this film tells us that to land a man you must be beautiful, regardless of what is going on inside of you.  In her all-out attempt to land the man, Streisand's character dumps her \\"Yentl\\" clothes and babushka's (oh alright, she doesn't really wear a babushka), works out, changes her hair and guess what?  Lands the man!<br /><br />Her mother is still Lauren Bacall.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's my favorite game, play it every night for about an hour or more. This is fun and funny keep going and going trying to tear s*** up.
B0007939NO|2.0|What a lousy film.<br /><br />Gene Kelly and a suddenly-getting-a-bit-paunchy Van Johnson are filmed on the back lot of MGM trying to make merry in this stupid ass musical.  Vincente Minnelli directs but his fine hand is rarely in evidence here.<br /><br />I don't know why anybody \\"loves\\" this movie.  I think even Gene Kelly hated it.  He wanted it to be filmed in Scotland which certainly would have upgraded this film.<br /><br />Historically, however, one must look at this film as one of the really last gasps of MGM's musical heritage.  It was downhill now (Dore Schary may he rot in hell) and after this - or during this - filming we were also given \\"The Opposite Sex\\", \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\", \\"Athena\\", \\"Hit The Deck\\", \\"Kiss Me, Kate\\".......all crap.<br /><br />It is with \\"Brigadoon\\" that you can actually see the bloom leaving the rose.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|It's hard to understand on the first go. I liked the idea because I like art, but the pictures were hard to see, too small to find the details.
0790729369|1.0|We happened to meet in a Boston hotel.  It was wild and fun, yet it will forever remain a footnote on the biography of my life.  I don't even remember his name.  But we had fun.  We laughed.  We drank.  We dined.  He sent be-home-soon telegrams to his wife in Omaha.  We got into a car accident.  That was awful, but I donated a kidney to him.  He lived.  We parted.<br /><br />This movie sucks.  It isn't wild or fun.  It drags.  And drags.  And drags.<br /><br />People think that just because Clint Eastwood is rich, then \\"smart director\\" must be sure to follow.  Not so.  He managed to snag Meryl Streep for this one, (it was, after all, based on a best-seller; a boring one).<br /><br />I really wish people would realize that just because a person is \\"known\\" (an Eastwood, a Clooney, a Pitt, etc.) does not necessarily make them smart.  They are merely rich.<br /><br />Me?  I'll go back to donating a kidney to the photographer I slept with for three and a half weeks.  It's a much more exciting tale than this walk through a graveyard.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|i followed all the instruction both in the manual and on the dvd but still cant get it to record anything to me pc. i am considering retuning it but will give it a couple more tries first.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I loved the movie and was particularly impressed at how they were able to free themselves from the original while keeping the characters.
B00AQSF6BO|5.0|Como siempre, Vicente Amigo nos da más que música. Da alma y alegría. As always Vicente Amigo delivers more than just music. He gives us his soul and happiness. This extraodinary mix of flemenco and celtic is the best yet!
0345505387|3.0|I really like Diane Gabaldon's novel's but I had never read a graphic novel before. It was interesting to see how she visualized the characters. Now I can see how they looked when I read another of the series.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|There were times when this story got a bit detailed and intense for me (when recounting the details of some of the 100-year old man's life), but overall, it was enjoyable and comical, and kept me interested in the story.
0807014273|5.0|I first read this book almost 30 years ago.  At that time, it led me to restructure my priorities to place more focus on family.  Since that time, I have given copies to friends and relatives as graduation gifts.  This copy was purchased for my grandson on his high school graduation.  I hope he learns as much from it as I did.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I am very happy that I read this book before watching the movie.  The book is so much more in depth and gave the story so much context.  I loved the movie too, but the book really fleshed out the entire story for me.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is an excellent book.  So glad I get to write this review instead of having to publicly speak about it.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is unlike the books I usually read. It weaves the very modern and high tech world of computers with the old and non-technical, with very likable characters. I enjoyed it very much.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|It seemed as if the writer and director wanted to lead us to some enlightened viewpoint. To me, it was just strange, boring and very long. I found myself fast forwarding the slow parts and didn't really care about the ending. If you finish a movie and say, &#34;so what?&#34;, it probably wasn't worth the time or money. Friends told me how wonderful it was, but I have had friends look at three strips of color on a canvas and try to convince me of the enlightenment of the artist...not recommended.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|Sometimes it gets a bit repetitive but overall good television. Loving the indecision on who she wants to be with and struggling to stay neutral during peters campaign.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|If I am not mistaken, this new series is a trilogy? I found the Hobbit to be very long, as if they wanted to stretch two movies into three. Of course, they would not do that to get extra money, I am sure. :)  Very long, slow plot development. I have read the books. If this is going to be one of three, it should have been sped up to be one of two movies. To be fair, to follow The Lord of the Rings is very difficult and caused extremely high expectations which could not be met.  See it? Yes, if you are a Tolkein fan.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|Personally I don't remember the previous movie well, however, this episode is good. Has a lot of story, and leaves you hanging and excited for the next.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I'm an unabashed Star Trek fan. I found this movie to have the best of the old and the new. A great new cast still true to the old characters, great modern special effects (and lots of them) and best of all a script true to the positive, affirming approach that is Star Trek.<br />Yes, there is one point where, having failed to build all the necessary back-story into the script the &#34;original&#34; Spock gives a long narrative speech (Yawn!). And the makeup on one green-skinned roommate is completely unbelievable, but in my book this flick still gets 5 stars for all the &#34;extra Star Trek goodness&#34; including Simon Pegg as Scotty, and great performances of Spock (both versions), and the new Lt. U.<br />But in the end, its not the special effects but this film's ability to carry forward Star Trek's positive tale of individuals and goodness triumphant that makes it a 5 star movie.
B00BF11STU|5.0|If you are intrigued by war and tactics. This movie shows it all. High tech military operations, insight into the history behind Osama, and demonstrates the power of the US Military. Very engaging and a truly must see movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Helps monitor kindle usage when out and about. Does precisely what it claims to do. And it's thoughtfully laid out, visually pleasing. Am very happy with it.
0439023513|3.0|After being enthralled by the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I have to admit The Mocking jay was a big disappointment.  Mrs. Collins descriptive power is still on display but I felt the plotting was slow and the book did not hold my interest.
B00005K9LM|4.0|This was a great follow up to Screaming for Vengeance.  If you liked that sound from JP you will like this album too.
B002HSSAY6|4.0|Good acting but too long pauses to build suspense or to establish character - but that is a very minor flaw in a great movie.
B008BO61BE|5.0|I first bought this when I was 13- on vinyl.  Still love it.  Bonus material is a plus.  Great buy.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I don't see how anyone could give this app anything less than 5 stars! It is amazing and addictive! It kills time when you need it and there are always new challenges to overcome. Better than temple run 1 &amp; 2!
B000063DFQ|5.0|First Maiden record I bought.  Probably the one of the best 4 records they made.  Not as dark and creepy as Number (which my parents banned from the house!)
B00BYH6OJO|3.0|Too much back and forth. Would have been better if the characters were reversed. Wasn't a very good movie for us.
B00C061I3K|4.0|It's a weird departure from what you might expect from Daft Punk, but it works surprisingly well. It's a wonderful tribute to disco, of all things, and to music in general. De Homem-Christo and Bangalter took a risk to bring some new sounds to electronic music, and it pays off.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I usually try to read the book before going to see the movie, however this one I did opposite. What a great book and very glad I saw the movie first I think the book was much better.  As always he has done it again
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I got these for DH as he is always taping Columbo's when they are on tv.  Now he has them all.  The ones we have watched are perfectly clear and in great condition.  They came so nicely packaged.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Nice logic game, but the too cute and repetitive comments of the &#34;totem&#34; while the puzzle loads/reloads are annoying.  Otherwise interesting.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good acting from several members of the cast.<br />Lots of excellent cinematic opportunities, well taken.<br />Ironically, this movie didn't take any chances.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|They finally got down to the business of killing permanent characters.  Long talked about battles were finally launched.  It was a great payoff.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love big, long, multi-character historical novels, and this is one.  I plowed through this in less than a week, staying up until 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning reading &#34;just one more chapter&#34;, even knowing I had to get up and go to work in the morning.  But I've always done that with Follett's novels, even back when he was writing suspense novels.  It's those short chapters that end on cliff-hangers.  They're like potato chips - you can't eat just one.  The characters are memorable, the situations are engrossing, and he looks at WWII not only from the American and British points of view, which I've read about a lot, but also from the German and Russian perspectives, which I haven't, and which I found interesting.  Of course, being WWII, there are people in miserable situations, which is painful to read about - some characters I liked a lot from the first book have terrible things happen to them (and, this being Follett, you read about it in detail) - but, even so, this was a great read.  I'm looking forward to the third book in the series.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|The show is great with all that action and zombies and the drama of tv crew, and full of suspense,somewhat kinda of scary at times, it's a great show and my fianc&eacute; are addicted to this show, thnx AMC©
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free and fun game. My wife played it so much that I decided to checkout what the craze was about. Now, we both enjoy the game.
B0058W74UY|3.0|This did not do what I thought it would.  I deleted it from my kindle.  I needed more information I guess.  :-(
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book starts of slow, picking up from Darcy's POV and honestly I hated her still... Until about halfway through where her life falls apart and she becomes a real person. This book is such a good follow up to something borrowed! I hope Kate Hudson is ready for round 2 on the screen, as I can't wait to see what thy do with this one.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|This is a Good story, interesting characters. I enjoy watching this series. And if you like bbc classics you will too!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie! I think it was better than the book that it was based upon.  I am from Philly so it is always great to see local spots in the city & suburbs in a movie.  I have actually eaten in that diner and work near another scene.  One odd point was when Tiffany uses the term &#34;76&#34; for Rt 76 as a location of something that happened & most people from the Philly area would say the expressway or the &#34;Schuylkill.&#34;<br /><br />I had seen an interview with Bradley Cooper where he tells of the lengths that Robert DeNiro took to get the Philly accent down.  The efforts showed.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I really enjoyed this trashy romp into solar sci-fi. It's not a literary masterpiece but its a page turner. Welcome home.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|Arguably the first great superstar of film, Charlie Chaplin was the man known simply as the Tramp in his silent movies. For this reason Modern Times seems like the perfect bridge between the early silent era and the age of talkies starting in the late 1920s. Chaplin had many successes earlier including The Gold Rush (1926) and City Lights (1931). However, people wanted to hear talking and soon enough everyone would have to make the transition or else die out. Because of Chaplin's popularity he was able to make one last great silent picture. From that point on however it got a lot louder in theaters. In this film the iconic Tramp character finds himself up against modern technology and the Great Depression. The whole movie seems to be critiquing factories, the police, the economy, and even modern film by using little actual dialogue. With that being said, this is a great film which exhibits everything that made Chaplin famous. He still has that walk, that mustache, and new hilarious antics to accompany everything else. Yet again there is a love story, between a tramp and a beautiful homeless girl played by Paulette Goddard (Only in the movies). Despite all the hardships they face this resilient pair amazingly still have hope. Fittingly, in the end the two lovebirds walk off into the background, seeming to bring the end of the Chaplin golden era, but also leaving us with a feeling of hope for the future.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's like she was tired of the series and just wanted it to end. No regard for all the fans who have been following since book 1. Shame on you, Charlaine.
B00AEFY0F2|4.0|In the classic starring Tom Hanks as the slow-witted but kindhearted Forrest, we see him as he takes part in history. From the day we see him teach Elvis how to dance, up to the point he runs across country, he is constantly part of or making history. However despite everything he has accomplished whether it is in Vietnam, playing ping-pong, or in the shrimping business, Forrest still is humble and seemingly oblivious to it all. His innocence is heartwarming amidst all the turmoil around him in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Hanks is supported wonderfully by Robin Wright, Mykelti Williamson, Gary Sinise, and Sally Fields. This film is funny as well as touching, making it wonderful to watch. The soundtrack also helps to transport you back to the different eras.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am not big on games where I am the villain, but I have to say, this game is very addictive.  I have played something like 10 games, and My battery has died twice on my kindle fire, but it has been 100% worth it.
0767827902|4.0|Starring Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybil Sheppard, and Ben Johnson, with director Peter Bogdanovich, the film revolves around young people in a small Texas town during the early 1950s. Although at first glance it seems simple and innocent, there is another side to the town, full of romantic entanglements, fights, and even deaths. Sonny (Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) are best friends without any real parents, only each other and some of the town folk. They have a falling out over a girl (Sheppard) and then Sonny sees the girl go off to college while Duane returns shortly only to ship out to Korea. However, Sonny is able to make amends with his friend and they see the last picture show. In the absence of his friends, Sonny is left in need of someone to fill the void. This film is interesting because it is shot with black and white cinematography and it only uses period music. This effectively creates a setting that appears to be very realistic.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|this app is good so far! getting used to the controls, but other than that, it's great! looking forward to use the different helicopters and going to different environments! this app is great so far! keep up the good work!
0783225733|4.0|Directed by Ron Howard and headlined by Tom Hanks, this film opens with the landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon. It then leads up to the Apollo 13 mission led by Jim Lovell (Hanks). We see his life, his colleagues, and the hard work that goes into such an undertaking. There are several hitches in preparation but the takeoff is smooth, beginning a supposedly routine mission. However, after a malfunction the situation turns dire very fast and the men who looked forward to walking on the moon now must struggle just to get home. They make difficult decisions and Lovell keeps them level-headed while Houston scrambles to problem solve and bring them home. This film is powerful and ultimately cheering with a good accompanying score. Howard does a wonderful job transporting us back to that time however I would have liked more back story on the astronauts leading up to their mission.
B00012QM8G|4.0|Schindler's List retells a dark time in mankind's history.  Interwoven with that theme, there is a story of sacrifice and caring that literally saved the lives of many who were thought worthless.  A cynical, greedy man is transformed into a man of character.  This version is particularly important because it includes closed captioning.  At last my wife, who has less than 30% of her hearing, can fully enjoy a movie we once saw in the theater.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This film is one of the best biographical films and it highlights one of the monstrosities of humanity in the form of the Holocaust. It may be hard to watch and it is overpowering but the fact is the types of events depicted actually happened and must be recognized. The characters of Oskar Schindler and Ammon Goth further make the story come alive serving as a sharp contrast to each other. From the beginning this film opens in black and white making you realize there is something special here. With Speilberg behind the camera, Liam Neeson takes on the role of Oskar Schindler. Historically, this German industrialist aided over a thousand Jews from the Holocaust. Neeson skillful portrays his character revealing the turmoil and peril Schindler faced. The cast is rounded out nicely by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. The film effectively moves the viewer to ponder humanity and also causes us to praise Schindler. Fittingly the movie closes with many surviving Jews laying flowers on the grave of their savior.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game. My granddaughter loves this game and she is 3. Easy to play and very realistic.great fun for all ages.
B0002XMKYE|4.0|Starring George C. Scott and Karl Malden, the film chronicles the exploits and controversy surrounding the great World War II general. Gaining fame  in Africa, Patton would move on to Sicily, and finally march toward Berlin. Patton was a colorful character who was highly religious, a war romantic, and he also had a big mouth. Despite often being tough and unpopular, over time Patton did garner the respect of many an aid, ally, and even enemy. His heroic 3rd army became famous for their exploits all across Europe. By the end of the war, Patton came out a very complex hero from a former age. The reason this film is good not only rest on it being a war movie but also based on character development. George C. Scott does a wonderful job of portraying the larger-than-life persona of Patton.
B002ECEJ3G|5.0|I bought this book as a gift, and the recipient said the book arrived in perfect condition.  It also shipped quickly.  My friend has never read Woolf before, and as a former English teacher I thought it would be a good first novel to try.  I love this book!
B00003CXD5|5.0|Putting Humphrey Bogart in his element once again, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre is another wonderful adventure film. Directed by John Huston, it tells the story of three men who join together in their search for an elusive treasure in Mexico. At the beginning, they are in good spirits eager to become wealthy. However, when they finally strike it rich they find it is not all it is cracked up to be . The situation escalates and they become paranoid of each other. Finally, Bogart's character Dobbs is pushed over the edge and commits a malicious act out of desperation. Seemingly as an act of karma, he meets with another form of justice. However, it seems that by the end no one actually wins. A surprisingly good film, Sierra Madre takes your usual treasure hunt and realistically depicts man's greed which often can overpower everything else. Bogart was supported nicely by Walter Huston (the father of the director) and Tim Holt.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|I never heard of him before I heard the first album of The Black Country Communion, with Glen Hughes, Jason Bonham and Derek Sherenian. He is unbelievable. I'm a white guy and I've lived through the Jonny Lang (I wish I was a Black Soul singer phase). But this guy is amazing and true to himself. I guess traditional blues and heavy-rock from the '70's wasn't enough for him. I am on board and plan on staying put. The only thing that I find odd, is he sounds live Eric Johnson from time to time. I like EJ, but it seems strange. Doesn't change the fact that Joe is a Monster and the only thing that can stop him is, Joe. Keep it up brother.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Adapted from the famous novel this film holds its own thanks to a stellar portrayal of Atticus Finch by Gregory Peck who embodied one of the most heroic screen personas because of his humility, his quiet strength, and his ability to understand others. Furthermore, this film covered the issue of prejudice when it was still a very explosive subject to many people. Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it. This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time. It follows the recollections of Scout (Mary Badham) as she remembers her childhood with her older brother Jem and their widowed, lawyer father Atticus. The plot revolves most importantly around the trial of a black man for an accused rape of a white girl. The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do. In probably his greatest performance, Gregory Peck portrayed a quiet yet courageous man, Lee had likened to her father. Instantly we are drawn to this well-grounded person who is not always liked or successful for that matter, but who always does what is ultimately right.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Only hated last 10 minutes of the season. Everything else great. Love the settings and accents and time period. Fairly historically acurate. Like combined representation of different classes and how they interacted
B0006GAOJA|5.0|This autobiographical boxing film directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Robert De Niro, Kathy Moriarty, and Joe Pesci. The film begins with a flashback to 1941 when Jake LaMotta (De Niro) lost a close fight. However, after that loss he begins his run for the middle weight title. Despite a difficult marriage, Jake's brother and manager introduces him to the young and beautiful Vickie. He continues to fight and in 1947 he is married once again. LaMotta has his share of troubles in the ring but he eventually becomes champion. At the same time his personal life is in a shambles thanks to his constant jealousy and paranoia towards his wife and brother. First, he is estranged from Joey and his career declines. Then after his retirement, Vickie files for a divorce. His days are spent entertaining in nightclubs as a washed up boxer. I enjoyed the reference to On the Waterfront at the end and despite the coarse language, the film had good characters, cinematography, and directing. LaMotta's life is one that I hope no one would have to experience because there is so much pain and anger in it.
B005TBWN0K|1.0|I'm an adult.  And a Technology Writer.  I just wanted to establish that I do not say this lightly...<br />The person responsible for this elementary, pathetic, excuse for an app really should be ashamed!<br />This is nothing. This app does LESS than ANY default software you already have for writing on a photo or screenshot.<br /><br />This is a pretty accurate summation of the Evernote company business model.  Meaning, they do the very least, and then advertise it as something way more than it is!<br /><br />Well, this is what eventually happens, Evernote... Eventually someone like me tells it like it is!<br /><br />It's borderline fraudulent to even produce an app like this that actually has less features than what it's supposed to replace!
B0045HCJ8U|4.0|The film adaption of the Tennessee Williams' play, A Street Car Named Desire was directed by Elia Kazan and stars Marlon Brando as the rough Polish husband of Stella Kowalski. Vivian Leigh plays the role of Stella's airy and superficial sister Blanche. The film opens in the French Quarter of New Orleans where the Southern Belle Blanche DuBois comes to live with Stella and Stanley. Over time we learn of her past full of forbidden love and other problems. Stanley is a brutish, dominating man and the arrival of Blanche upsets his relationship with his wife. A friend of Stanley's, Mitch (Karl Malden) is drawn to Blanche but the conflict between her and Stanley make the relationship impossible. Now Stanley knows of her past and confronts Blanche about it. His cruelty and violence lead to her final breakdown. Ultimately, Mitch is angered, Stella is grief-stricken, and Stanley shows his dependence on Stella. This film is full of drama and at times you dislike both Stanley and Blanche. Mitch is one of the characters you actually feel for.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|We have enjoyed all the seasons of the Tudors, but this is the one that grabs you first.  May not be historically accurate, but I sure wanted to learn more separate from the show.
B00004TDTO|4.0|This is arguably the first great modern blockbuster and it had such a tremendous cultural impact. Who knew a rogue shark, a wonderfully chilling score, and an isolated setting off the east coast could send so many shivers up the spines of audiences. Jaws is the classic man vs. nature story and proves how deadly it can turn out. The movie that kept millions of people from going in the Ocean in the 70s, Jaws tells of a shark terrorizing a tourist trap off the coast of Massachusetts. The policeman (Roy Scheider) must team up with a marine scientist (Richard Dreyfuss), and a hunter (Robert Shaw) to bring down the monster. Together they embark to try to hunt down and kill this menace of the deep. Little do they know how dangerous this creature is. When they finally meet they are in for a few unpleasant surprises. It is evident that either man or best must win or die. There is no compromise when man goes up against shark. This early Speilberg film was a glimpse of good thing to come and successfully began his great career.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Finding this app very useful as it has included allergy warnings along with weather. I have found it invaluable to avoid allery issues.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Starring Fay Wray, this Pre-Code film starts with a movie director who wants to travel by ship to a wilderness in order to shoot his next picture. However, he needs a leading lady and that is where Ann Darrow (Wray) comes in. He finds her in New York and brings her along to use in his film. All too soon the filming plans go awry after natives take Ann as an offering for Kong. The filmmaker, first mate, and some crewmen go looking for her only to run into enormous trouble. Kong proves to be deadly but he is brought down and Ann is saved from her giant suitor. The movie man takes Kong to New York as a show attraction. The Beast cannot be contained and escapes going on to terrorize the inhabitants of the city. In the climatic scene atop the Empire State Building the story is finally resolved. The special effects are obviously not great compared to modern standards but that is part of the charm. With its pulse pounding score and many harrowing moments, King Kong certainly has its thrills.
B0058FW06Y|3.0|My seven year old grandson wanted this and I did purchase for his entertainment...although the content didn't get into nudity, there was strong sexual intent and would not have purchase for him if I had known. Dard and eerie move.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is not only a Christmas classic but a classic in any sense of the word. It is the best of Stewart and Capra adding up to one of the most heartwarming stories of all time.  This may exhibit Stewart is his every man role once again but it breaks away from Mr. Smith in many ways making it another uniquely great film. A film like this that makes you know and feel for characters is certainly worth watching. Starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed with a fantastic supporting cast,  the film tells the life story of George Bailey. We watch with the angel Clarence as he sees George's life unfold. George saves his brother Harry as a boy and as a result loses hearing in his ear. He plans to travel and go to college but once more he sacrifices. He builds up all those around him with selfless kindness while also standing up to the grumpy millionaire Mr. Potter. Eventually he marries the love of his life and has children. Although by unfortunate circumstances Bailey finds himself contemplating suicide. That's when Clarence comes into his life to show George just how important he really is. Once he gets his life back George finds immediate joy and gains so much because of his friends and family. There is nothing much to do after this film but simply be happy. It is a Wonderful film in many ways, with a wonderful cast, and a wonderful message.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's really fun. I play this game basically every day. You can upgrade your kingdom and invade friends. 1 of the only things I would want to change is to have more things cost coins instead of gems.
B000R8YC18|4.0|Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film stars Robert De Niro with Jodie Foster and Cybil Sheppard. The story opens with a Vietnam vet, Travis Bickle (De Niro) who takes a job as a taxi driver. Travis is a quiet and lonely man who is turned off by the scum and filth he sees on the streets of New York. He becomes enthralled with a beautiful campaign worker who eventually turns him off. Then he also comes in contact with a young girl who makes her living working the streets. His frustration deepens and he begins to work out and collect weapons. It becomes obvious he is about to explode and after an initial failed attempt he does  just that. However, ironically the aftermath leaves him as a hero. Travis is an interesting character because you feel sorry for him and yet he does things that are truly wrong. I found Bernard Hermann's score, the voice-over narration, and the cryptic ending all to be interesting parts of this film.
B000S58428|5.0|This one has been out for a while but still one of my favorites.  Love Coldplay's sound and this album.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Starring Leonardo DiCapprio with Kate Winslet and director James Cameron, the film opens with an exploration of the submerged Titanic. An interesting discovery puts the explorers in contact with an elderly woman who was there in April 1912. Rose recounts her arrival as a newly engaged 1st class passenger. She felt trapped in her life until she accidentally met Jack, a 3rd class drifter who won his ticket in a poker game. After he saves her life, their forbidden relationship continues as they spend more time together. Jack, who is an artist, even does a charcoal drawing of Rose. However, all too soon the unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and chaos ensues in the following hours. Heroically, once again Jack keeps Rose alive although he himself perishes in the cold. Back in the present Rose now keeps him alive with her memories. This epic romance is fairly good with a semi-autobiographical story, special effects, and a decent score.

B0000DJZ8R|4.0|I must admit this film directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda, surprised me in a positive way. This movie seemed like it could potentially be another Citizen Kane  (a movie so inflated with praised that it becomes a letdown when actually viewed). However, The Grapes of Wrath in fact has a fairly good story adapted loosely from John Steinbeck's novel. You come out of it feeling the strength of the Joads as well as the inhumanity they face traveling from the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma to California. Still, there is hope that they will endure it all in the end. Fonda gives a solid performance as the plain-speaking, young man Tom Joad. Jane Darwell also gives a very moving performance as his Ma. Some may say this movie has its slow parts but it also has some very good moments as well.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|This is a very refreshing injection of rock and roll at its best. Doug Aldrich has the perfect bluesy hard rock sound. They knocked it out of the park with this one! Every song on here is killer! It will be huge in Europe and Japan. Hopefully it will catch on here in the States. I will purchase all future releases from these guys.
B0045HCJ94|4.0|Starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton with director Mike Nichols, this taboo-braking adaption of the stage play revolves around a middle-aged couple. George is a professor and he and his wife Martha have a love-hate relationship. Urged by her influential  father, Martha invites a young couple to their home. Because of the late hour and lots of alcohol, the rest of the evening becomes a wild war full of nasty insults, hurtful games, and manipulation. Martha and George use their guests and go as far as physical violence. However, in the end secrets are uncovered and they realize that they truly are afraid of Virginia Woolf. What began as a joke became all too true. At points this film seemed to elude me but I will say the acting was intense and powerful. There were moments where you disdain these people, then you feel pity for their plight, and other times you may even be able to relate to them in some ways.
B005544TRQ|5.0|&#34;Suits&#34; was something I chance upon, bored in a hotel room, waiting for a phone call.  I enjoyed it so much that I kept watching it at home.  Harvey is the best character--Mike is &#34;off&#34; to me a bit-and the rest of the cast works well.  None of it is believable, on a lot of different levels, but it's fun to watch.
B007XF4J66|5.0|Considered one of the greatest films of all-time this well-loved classic deserves to be here. It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that. This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time. Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, \\"Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does it again. Great read. I have read all her books some even twice. She keeps you guessing right up until the end.
B000O599ZS|5.0|One of John Wayne and John Ford's best westerns respectively, The Searchers follows an ex-Confederate soldier (Wayne) as he looks for his niece Debbie, who was taken by Indians when they killed her parents. Now Wayne and a young man played by Jefferey Hunter must look for her and bring Debbie home. With an almost obsessive desire, Wayne's character Ethan Edwards vows to find her. Along the way the old vet and young man have conflicting personalities that get in the way. Even when they finally find her, she has become more Indian than white and Edwards seems bent on killing her much to Hunter's horror. In the end, the gruff but courageous searcher shows his true colors. A great western, and simply a wonderful film, The Searchers has a lot to offer with great action, Monument Valley scenery and of course John Wayne. The supporting cast is good as well, including Vera Miles, Natalie Wood, Ward Bond, and Ken Curtis.

B000AP04OM|4.0|Starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, this musical follows a light-hearted nun who becomes the governess for the seven children of a widowed Austrian naval captain. When she first meets the children they are hostile towards her but they quickly become fond of Maria. However, when the captain gets wind of their adventures he is angry. Initially Maria is sent away but then the captain has a change of heart. After an evening full of fun, Maria is sent off this time by a jealous baroness. She returns later on the urging of a nun and Von Trapp then realizes his true love for Maria. However, everything is not well as the Von Trapps get ready for the Salzburg Music Festival since the Nazis are on the rise. With a little kindly help they are able to make their getaway in the end. I have to say that this is not one of my favorite films but the soundtrack is one of the most memorable of all time and Andrew's voice is truly beautiful.
B00B04NJLW|4.0|This movie is a lot to digest--due to the diverse, yet oddly large creative minds that make up 26 shorts.  I could take this movie too seriously, because many of the shorts are just so bizarre, sadly, I would have liked more diversity it seemed a rotation of directors/writers being from either Japan or Spain.  One problem is the transition from film to film is non existent, so you jump from humor, to disquieting, to campy, to terror, and the pace never seems to truly fit.  This was definitely fun to watch, might have been better with a group to discuss, but something is missing...I sure had some favorites (Letters C,D, K,L, N, Q, T, X), when you think that only 1/3 of the films you actually enjoyed compared to the 2/3 that were forgettable, you have to wonder what happen. Some of the movies are so bizarre you wonder why anyone would ever make or want to watch such celluloid trash, it would have been nice to replace some of the less enjoyable shorts with something watchable.  I no doubt think any horror fan should check this movie out, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it unless it was on clearance. Be prepared for letters (F,L,X,Y,Z).  Some of these films are just disturbing or maybe just plain asinine.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film begins with a young banker who is falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He soon finds himself in Shawshank prison, the year 1947. When he arrives the resourceful \\"Red\\" (Freeman) believes the aloof man will be a pushover. However, after a major turning point Andy does many extraordinary things in the prison. Whether it is a nice deed for a friend, improving the prison library, carving chess pieces out of rock, or doing taxes for the guards, he keeps himself busy. The strict warden keeps him down but unlike others, Andy does not lose hope. He still has one miraculous trick up his sleeve. Fittingly he instills \\"Red\\" with hope and in the end they are reunited. I found this film intriguing because in such a corrupt and immoral place, Andy always seems to strive for good. His spirit is ultimately inextinguishable.
1452101248|4.0|We had been tired of rotating the our vegetarian recipes and needed a book that would provide us with reliable recipes and ideas. This was a great purchase to that end. This book uses a lot of commonly-found ingredients (and a handful of more exotic ones - e.g. Sumac, za'atar) and the directions are written very well. The food pictures are gorgeous, too.
B00871C09S|5.0|Starring James Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr with director Alfred Hitchcock, this is a superb film that takes place in a very limited space. L.B. Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who is incapacitated in his flat with a broken leg. All he has to pass the time is watching the people across the courtyard. Although he very rarely interacts with them, he slowly begins to know them just by spectating. Pretty soon he realizes something is amiss when the annoying wife across the way is no where to be seen and her husband (Burr) is acting strangely. With help of his ravishingly beautiful girlfriend (Kelly), Jeffries tries to uncover the truth. Everything escalates when Lisa breaks into the man's apartment and it finally peaks in a climatic confrontation. In the end all is well and Jeffries realizes his true love. This is one of my favorite films because of its unique setting and it is possibly Hitchcock's best. He takes an environment that is so confined and then makes a very entertaining and suspenseful film with it.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|While interesting there were times when the book seemed to drag on and some places where it seemed repetitive. Overall not a bad addition to pride and prejudice.
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is much appreciated now but this film especially stands out in American culture because it was a first rate horror film when that was an anomaly. It has a chilling score, a notorious villain, and a sequence that is one of the most famous in film history. Directed by Hitchcock and starring Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, and Vera Miles, this film is intense from the opening sequence. Marion Crane seems to be your average love-struck woman stuck in her job. However everything quickly changes for her after she runs off with $40,000 that had been entrusted to her. Before she can get it to her boyfriend she must stop for the night at the Bates Motel. She rents a room and meets the timid, unassuming proprietor Norman. Soon it becomes obvious that he likes her but his domineering mother does not approve. Then later when Marion is taking a shower she is brutally murdered. Soon the situation becomes even more confused when a private investigator winds up missing. Marion's sister and boyfriend resolve to go to the motel themselves. Little do they know the shocking events that await them. Undoubtedly Hitchcock's most famous film, Psycho shakes the nerves and excites. Furthermore, it solidified Norman Bates as one of the most notorious villains of all time.

B0006Z2KX4|4.0|In this mile-a-minute screwball comedy directed by Howard Hawks, Cary Grant is forced to deal with Katharine Hepburn's ditsy socialite character. A Paleontologist (Grant) has been trying to assemble a dinosaur but he is missing a bone. On top of that Huxley is about to enter into an unhappy marriage and he also must impress a museum donor. The next day he meets a socialite (Hepburn) by accident and through a mix up he finds himself being taken to her home in order to help take care of a tame leopard named Baby. In the following chaos a dog buries the bone needed for the dinosaur, visitors come, Baby runs away, a wild leopard is on the loose, and the free-spirited girl finds herself falling for \\"Mr. Bone.\\" To complicate matters, the pair wind up in jail trying to explain their story to a quirky constable. In the end everything works out and despite the craziness, Huxley realizes he cannot live without this girl. This may not be  my favorite screwball comedy, but I would say it definitely is the zaniest and that stands for something.

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|As the last collaboration between Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock, they came together to make the ultimate thriller in North by Northwest. Grant plays a common business man named Roger Thorndike who is framed as a killer in a very public place. All of the sudden he has become a fugitive on the run for a crime he never even committed. Along the way he meets a government agent (Eve Marie Sainte) while dodging the authorities. Trying to clear his name, Grant finds himself fleeing the actual killers. His adventures include a run-in with a crop dusting plane and eventually find him hanging for dear life.  However, he comes out on top in the end and he slowly falls in love too (of course). From the beginning when you see the opening credits and hear the score, you gear up for adventure and that is exactly what you get. It follows the wonderful tradition of Hitchcock films and it does not fail to entertain. Besides great locations, a memorable score, and interesting camera work, the story is wonderful.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Way too long and way too boring.. the actors in the film went to waste.  I feel if they were going to change from the book they should of changed more
B000055Y0X|4.0|Living up to its name, this satire directed by Stanley Kubrick is quite peculiar to say the  least. The nation is on the edge of nuclear war because of a lunatic general (Sterling Hayden) who made the decision to override the authority of the president (Peter Sellers). Tempers flare in the war room as the leaders decide what to do. Will the Doomsday device be unleashed as Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again) supposes or will the bomb be stopped in time? One of the obvious highlights of this film would have to be Peter Seller's performances as three distinct characters. George C. Scott also delivers a very respectable performance as a general advising the president. Then, there is Slim Pickens who is often remembered for the famous bomb riding scene. This film is good but in my mind it is not great. However, it does depict an era of tremendous fear brought on by the Cold War, thus making it historically important.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read through a bunch of the hundreds of horrible reviews but still bought the book.  I liked it.  I did not want Sookie to end up with Eric.  It made no sense for her to get back with Bill, even though I like Bill better than Eric.  The story was good.  I didn't see any problems with the plot.  It did not feel like a hurriedly written book.  I have no idea why people disliked it so much.  The conclusion to the series made sense in my mind.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Starring Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss with a host of others, this George Lucas directed film follows the lives of young people in California during the early 60s. It is the night before Dreyfuss and Howard are going off to college. They both want to make the most of the time left. However, Howard spends all his time trying to strengthen his relationship with his girlfriend (Cindy Williams). Dreyfuss on the other hand finds himself out in the town talking with girls and proving himself to a group of thugs. The rest of the film consists of the hot rodding antics of two other characters. A tough speedster (Paul Le Mat) finds himself driving around a 12 year-old girl. \\"Toad\\" the nerdy one (Charles Martin Smith), finds himself spending a wild night with a nice but peculiar girl. With its classic music accompanied by Wolfman Jack and the vintage cars, American Graffiti is a blast from the past.
0425264351|5.0|Same review as Die Trying - another great Lee Child book - he knows how to keep the suspense building and how to keep the reader engaged.  LOVE his books.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Morgan Freeman, the film opens with two cowboys who disfigure a prostitute. The sheriff, Little Bill (Hackman) gives them a punishment but the other women pool their funds to pay for bounty hunters. A young gun requests the help of a former outlaw Will Mummy (Eastwood) so they can collect the payment. However, because his deceased wife changed his ways, at first Will is reluctant. In need of money, he eventually heads off and brings along his old partner Ned (Freeman). After an initial conflict in the town of Big Whiskey, they kill the first one of their targets. Ned backs out and leaves the other two to get the second victim. After they do it, they find out Ned met trouble from the merciless sheriff. The young gunslinger gets cold feet and so an angry Mummy heads into town for the final showdown. Eastwood's character is interesting because he starts out trying to be good but he finally reverts back to his old ways. In this film it is difficult to tell who is bad or good. Everyone is simply human.
0425264386|5.0|Love ALL Lee Child's books - decided to go back to the beginning and read some of his earlier works.  NOT disappointed!  Great book.
B0006GANN2|4.0|In this crime thriller starring Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider, two detectives, Popeye Doyle and Cloudy Russo, work the grimy, tough streets of Brooklyn. They think they have happened upon a narcotics job and they use tapping and tailing to close in on the suspicious activity with a french connection. With no real results, they get pulled off the special assignment. That all changes after an unexpected twist followed by a wild chase. Doyle and his partner are finally close to cracking the case but it still takes more work and even more waiting. Finally, they seem to have the culprits but it ends far from perfectly for them. Up to the end Doyle is bent on finding \\"the frog\\" who has eluded him for so long. The ending felt a little too abrupt for my liking. However, this film did a good job at portraying the ugly and dirty side of New York realistically.
0752849123|5.0|Currently reading this novel - had never heard of Harlan Coben before - so far have been pleased with his writing and the level of intensity of the book. Enjoyable read.
B00003CX8V|4.0|Starring Jack Lemmon, Shirley Maclaine, and Fred McMurray, with director Billy Wilder, the film follows C. C. Baxter (Lemmon). He is a young man working in a large corporation that is very difficult to get ahead in. His only chance of moving up is through loaning his apartment to company executives so they can entertain their lady friends. This set up causes him constant inconveniences and leads to complaints from neighbors.  One of these complications involves a elevator girl from work (Maclaine) who was left sleeping in his bed. Soon Baxter must figure out how to nurse her to health and cover for the executive who left her. During the process he slowly feels himself falling in love but it all ends there when she is to be married to the recently-divorced executive. Finally, finding his backbone, Baxter quits his new high-level job and eventually reunites with his love. Wilder and Lemmon teamed up again following Some Like it Hot and this one is pretty good movie-wise!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I own every AIC albums, minus the best of ones....and I had very low expectations on this one.  In fact, I never intended to bother buying it.  But I found it at a pawn shop for 1 dollar...so I couldn't pass it up.  Now, it's my favorite AIC albums to list to.  I really love it when I find an album that I don't have to skip a single song on it.  This is very solid album with no filler.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Jerry's voice on the last track \\"black gives way to blue\\" is so amazing.  Great job guys!!
B000BZISTE|4.0|The inspiration for the award-winning TV series, MASH follows the quips and antics of two doctors as they are stationed in Korea. Starring Donald Sutherland, Eliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, with director Robert Altman, it brims with sexual banter, bloody bodies, and comedic moments. MASH effectively is a commentary against war and is seemingly as somber as it is funny. However, up to the end you are left with a smile on your face. The climatic moments during the football game will have all riled up and fittingly we see Captain Pierce (Sutherland) ride away in the same stolen jeep he had when arriving. The iconic theme \\"Suicide is Painless\\" adds to the composition. Overall it is a good film much different then the MASH we got to know on television.
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|I didn't realize that it was in a cardboard sleeve!  I purchased this as a gift, however, Loreena Mckennitt is always good.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This movie is a comedy, a romance, and above all a musical. However along with the immortal dance routines there is a plot and characters that are memorable as well. It helps to glorify a very different time in Hollywood and delivers a film that is funny and full of excellent song and dance. There is something about this film that makes it extremely special. Even after seeing it many times I am still captivated by every joke and every unforgettable song. What can beat the brilliance and antics of Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor backed by Debbie Reynolds? There is a touching love story to go along with these great actors and songs. Gene Kelly's sloshing about in the title song is timeless and O'Connor delivers a hilarious performance in such songs as Make 'em Laugh. There are a few dance sequences that are drawn out but the rest is top notch and keeps the audience enamored the entire time. This truly is a classic movie and musical that is both funny and heartwarming.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great for all ages and really taps in to creativity.  I recommend playing multiple games at once so that you not just waiting on a couple people.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|This is a great film-noir but more importantly it serves as a biting picture of the Hollywood lifestyle . Billy Wilder created a very interesting film that is well worth watching. It puts a very contrasting pair together and delivers the tale with a exceptional style of storytelling. In this film starring William Holden and Gloria Swanson (real-life silent film star) a down-on-his-luck writer, strictly by chance, finds himself living with a forgotten film actress. From the very beginning he finds her eccentric and her mansion chilling. All the same he agrees to live there in order to edit her movie script and earn some much needed money. Soon she grows accustomed and dependent on him since her only other companion is a butler. Hoping to make a comeback she goes to director Cecil B. Demille but it becomes evident to those around her that things will not work out. At the same time the young writer begins to distance himself as he begins to fall for a young woman writer he has been working for. In a chilling ending someone dies and another goes seemingly mad because the tension has grown too great. This film is very well done from the flashback and narration at the beginning to its critique of Hollywood and the parallelism with real events.

B00004RF97|4.0|Headlined by Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart, The Philadelphia Story  tells a comical tale of a divorced socialite who is about to be remarried. Tracy Lord is an arrogant socialite who divorced her equally fiery husband C.K. Dexter Haven. Now it is the day before her wedding to another man. However, Haven returns and brings a long two magazine reporters to get a scoop they were forced into. After a lavish party and many drinks the reporter (Stewart) and Tracy Lord find themselves spending an inebriated night talking and swimming. Haven manipulates the situation and the future husband Kittridge, who catches the tail end, believes something bad is happening. The next morning the wedding is in jeopardy and Hepburn and Stewart are oblivious. Although nothing happened, Lord agrees to terminate the wedding and Mike (Stewart) tries to save her embarrassment by proposing marriage. However, she realizes it is not meant to be and goes to Haven while Mike returns to the camera woman who loves him. It all ends well but the joke is still on them in the end. This romantic comedy has a lot of star power and it is actually pretty good.

6305132984|4.0|In this 1960s, musical adaption of Romeo and Juliet, two lovers become infatuated with each other but the problem is that none of their friends would ever approve. They come from two different classes and backgrounds which are constantly at odds. The two sides frequently clash as represented by the Shark and Jet gangs. Naively, the lovers believe they can get away and be happy forever. However, the situation escalates when the gangs take part in a rumble. Pretty soon the situation is out of control and it has become something nobody wanted. Hope for the future finally seems possible for the pair but it is brutally crushed in an instant. The viewer is left with a feeling of tragedy. This is a very good film for the most part and many of the songs are great, sticking with you afterwards. I suppose it is quite difficult to go wrong with a story from Shakespeare.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Starring a great cast of characters including Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, this is a great incarnation of Batman. In this film Bruce Wayne, alias Batman (Bale), faces his biggest challenge to protect Gotham City yet in the form of the villainous Joker (Ledger) With the help of Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent, Lucius Fox, and of course Alfred, he works to bring peace. However, the Joker is not your everyday criminal. This psychotic villain's only goal is to create utter chaos and he forces the Batman into difficult choice after difficult choice. By the end, the lines are so blurred it is hard to tell who actually won. Ledger's performance alone makes this movie a good one. His unpredictable and chilling portrayal has the audience constantly intrigued. Thus your everyday action packed, superhero film becomes an unconventional showdown between good and evil.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|With the great combo of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the legendary outlaws, this movie is great fun. The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang became infamous for their exploits with Butch (Newman) being the brains and Sundance (Redford) the fastest gun around. Together these two robbed banks, held up trains, and all the while had a good time. At one point or another the law was after them so they fled to South America with one of Butch's nefarious schemes in mind. However, it was not what they expected and they had to face their biggest challenge ever. With the odds against them, they went out fighting and the legend of Butch Cassidy and Sundance was forever solidified. This film is as much a lighthearted comedy as it is a western. Newman and Redford have hilarious dialogue that brings the film alive and you end up rooting for these two anti-heroes. Although it is a seemingly random addition the song \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\\" is an added bonus.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I'll join the minority and say that I was disappointed by this movie.  Yes, there's a lot of imagery which is spectacular, even breathtaking.  But regarding the story and its purported meaning, I didn't get it.  The New-Agey Indianish spirituality was only superficial and I saw little of the human condition usefully captured by this movie.  Sorry, either this movie fooled a lot of people or I was way out of tune while watching it.
B001HPP2XW|4.0|Starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard, the movie follows the lavish lifestyle of the ditsy Holly Golightly. Moving into her apartment building, the down-on-his-luck writer Paul immediately grows fond of Holly's quirky personality. Considering each other simply friends, Paul comes to one of Holly's wild parties and they journey through New York together. However, although Paul is falling for Holly, his circumstances seem to prevent it and besides she is oblivious to his affection. Slowly they fall farther apart with Holly's upcoming marriage to a wealthy man. In the end they do reconcile, embracing in the rain (of course). Holly has finally found a man who truly loves her and does not use her. The love story is an interesting one and Hepburn gives a lively performance. Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\" is a wonderful addition to this film. I would say however that this is not my favorite film with Hepburn because it is certainly hard to top Roman Holiday.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I liked it because it seemed to accurately depict the historical events.<br />However the characters were not developed with much depth.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Starring Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci with direction by Martin Scorcese, the film follows the true story of Henry Hill and his life as a mobster. Early on in the 50s Henry began doing work for the influential mobster Paulie (Paul Sorvino). He began skipping school and slowly begins making a lucrative living with the mob.  Soon he meets Jimmy Conway (De Niro) who loves to hijack trucks as well as the foul-mouthed, quick-tempered robber Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Over time Henry becomes successful after an Air France robbery and eventually he gets married to a woman named Karen (Lorraine Bracco). However, Henry gets caught up in a murder and he also starts seeing another woman. He still has problems but he begins a lucrative drug trade and the Lufthansa heist is pulled. The heat is on and Henry is eventually caught and decides to rat on his friends. He is then forced to live life as a nobody. I appreciated the period music, voice over, tracking shots, and freeze frames. The language of DeVito and others is tiresome but it shows how inherently corrupt they are.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Love the book.  Can see the TV characters as you're reading along.  I have several others and plan on getting more!
B000059H99|5.0|Maybe not the greatest film of all time, Rocky is however one of the most heartwarming and greatest sports films ever. Sylvester Stallone gives a likable performance as the title nobody who defies the odds. Combining the cheering story with some famous sequences and a great theme you get something very memorable. The original film that shot Sylvester Stallone to stardom, Rocky tells the tale of a boxer who receives the chance of a lifetime. Rocky Balboa is a mediocre boxer who has no real chance of becoming anything. However he is spotted by a world champion boxer Apollo Creed who wishes to face Rocky as a publicity stunt. Here Rocky finally has the chance to prove himself and become something. In some iconic scenes he trains in his buddy's meat freezer with the famous theme playing in the background. When the day of the fight comes it is evident that Rocky is no fluke and he may even have a chance to win. What makes this movie so touching is Rocky's humble beginnings and his lovable personality. He may be slow but you want him to succeed because he is so kindhearted. This movie was so popular that it led to many sequels but nothing quite beats the original. Yo Adrian!
B005K17RU0|1.0|No matter what I do the maps do not work on my S3. Also,  the screens are way to cluttered with information.
B00003CX9E|4.0|The brain-child of Orson Welles, Citizen Kane opens somewhat unimpressively, however it is certainly very moody and atmospheric. As the camera closes in on a great mansion we are given a first hand view of a dying man and his mysterious final word \\"Rosebud.\\" In the following newsreel we learn the man was Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a millionaire tycoon and newspaper man. A journalist is enlisted to find out anything he can about Kane. He scours the memoirs of Kane's deceased childhood guardian. Then, he talks with Mr. Bernstein who worked with Kane's paper the Inquirer. He gets around to talking to Kane's unstable former friend Jedediah Leland as well as Kane's second wife. We learn from these accounts about his early years, his success with yellow journalism, the evolution of his first marriage, and the rise and fall of his political career. Furthermore, we find out about Kane's unhappy second marriage that ultimately left him loveless after looking for affection his whole life. Fittingly, we are again left with the bleak view of his fortress Xanadu and we now have the knowledge that \\"Rosebud\\" was in fact utterly trivial.<br /><br />Obviously, Greg Toland's black and white cinematography using deep focus and low camera angles is wonderful. The framing of the narrative with different points of view and flashbacks was unique at the time. The actors age in front of us showing the progression of time and montage is used to effectively condense time. There is the overlapping and fragmentation of dialogue to create a realistic feel throughout the film. Bernard Hermann puts together a score that slowly changes along with Kane. And of course you have the supposed basis of Kane on William Randolph Hearst. Historically, Citizen Kane may in fact be the most important film and artistically it is certainly up there with the best of them. I will let others decide if that makes it the very best film, period.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed both  the story and the lessons in plants and their meanings.  I wish the book was longer so I could have kept reading.  A bit disappointed that some of the characters just fell away towards the end.
B00003CXD0|4.0|Starring Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Terri Garr, and BIll Murray, this comedy film follows a fiery actor as he tries to find work. Despite his skill, no one wants to work with Michael Dorsey (Hoffman) and so he masquerades as a woman to get a job on a soap. However, soon he gets so caught up in his role as Dorothy, he cannot get himself out. His character is so popular on the soap that she is renewed forcing Dorsey to endure it even longer. Then he finds himself befriending a shy actress on the soap (Lange) while he starts neglecting another actress friend (Garr). Along the way he has many awkward moments and romantic entanglements. The worst of these comes when he must reveal who he is (only his roommate and agent know). At first it causes pain but ultimately honesty is the way to go. This film was reminiscent of screwball comedies and it had some very hilarious moments. I have to say Hoffman pulled it off.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Great selection. You can layer sounds also. Wish it had a timer to auto shutoff for sleep. Easy to use.
0792163710|5.0|There is often something special about westerns and Shane is no different. Directed by George Stevens and starring Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, Jean Arthur, and other great character actors, Shane is simple yet charming. It has many of the qualities of a great movie because of what it shows of mankind. Furthermore, it simply makes you feel good. In the film Shane (Ladd) is a wandering ex-gunslinger who decides to live with a frontier family as a hired hand. His presence makes everyone happy because he is quiet, humble, and fundamentally so good. However, there is trouble from a man named Riker and his gang. Heflin's character is adamant he must face the foe and defend his home. Shane will not allow it knowing this is a job for him. The two friends fight it out with Shane winning and riding into town. In the end, he wins the shoot out but more importantly he is reconciled with the family's boy Joey. The time has come for him to move on and Shane rides off into the distance, a humble hero.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book has been a great inspiration for me & I appreciate that it comes from a physician with such an over abundance of secular education & ties it together so firmly with the spiritual realm.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Starring Alec Guiness and William Holden with director David Lean, this is a World War II film that follows the exploits of British POWs and also Allies on a secret mission. Guiness is the proud and principled British Colonel who leads his men in a memorable entrance. With stubbornness he wages a war of wits against the Japanese camp overseer. He inspires his men and eventually reaches his goal of personally leading them in the completion of the bridge. At the same time an American soldier (Holden) attempts escape and somehow winds up alive and safe. However, all too soon he is sent right back with specialized commandos to destroy the bridge. In a chaotic and tragic finale, the British colonel puts a wrench in the plans and the implications are costly even though the objective is achieved. This is a magnificent and enjoyable film with good cinematography, interesting characters, a two-sided story, and of course whistling!
B0018QOIXU|3.0|The music on this cd is ok but the case it comes in is very flimsy and will break maybe.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|In this hellish adaption of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness set in Vietnam, Martin Sheen is a captain given a classified mission. He must go down the river into Cambodia to terminate a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone rogue. The main part of the film follows his journey on a boat with a small crew of men. They meet up with a hardened napalm-loving colonel (Robert Duvall), watch a USO show, and witness as well as take part in senseless killing. With the crew whittled down, Willard finally reaches the outpost of Kurtz, only to witness the horror that lies there. After waiting so long to complete his mission, Willard feels conflicted about it upon seeing Kurtz. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's most famous films and it truly was a labor of love since it took a long time to complete. Although their parts may seem minimal, Brando, Duvall, Dennis Hopper, and even Harrison Ford contribute. Because I read the source novel, I could appreciate the film in that sense but The Godfather is a better film in my opinion.

0784011710|4.0|Starring Meryl Streep in a remarkable performance, the film opens in 1947 with the writing hopeful Stingo. He moves into a room in Brooklyn and quickly befriends the romantic pair of Sophie (Streep) and Nathan (Kevin Kline). However, as their friendship grows Stingo realizes the ghosts in Sohphie's past since she was a Polish concentration camp survivor. Nathan on the other hand can be both charming and cruel thanks in part to his own set of secrets. Stingo feels himself falling for Sophie but she realizes it can never be recalling her last shrouded memory. She was forced to make a choice that would haunt her and ultimately fill her life with tragedy. All I can say is that this film is made by the brilliant acting of Streep. Several of the scenes were very powerful as well. They brought up difficult issues that can be hard to answer.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Nice problem solving game...not treated bad for experimentation.  go back later for higher scores from improved learning....but BEWARE....My kindle fire flew out of my hands tryin' to cut the rope at the right time! !  Great work you Brits. 5 Stars from Lawson di Ransom Canyon
B00003CXCD|5.0|Starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn with direction by William Wyler, this movie has one of the greatest romances ever depicted on screen. Hepburn is a young princess named Ann on a trip to a foreign country. However, she is constantly bored from the rigidness of her life. On a whim she escapes in the night and finds herself sleepily wandering the streets of Rome. An American journalist (Peck) happens upon the disorientated princess and eventually decides to take her in since she seems lost. Soon enough he figures out just who she is and decides to take her through Rome with a friend (Eddie Albert) so they can get a scoop. Together they take her through the city to explore and secretly take candid photos. However, Peck soon finds himself falling in love and he cannot bring himself to submit the article. With the thanks of the princess, they are left with the simple satisfaction that they were able to spend the day together. Peck and Hepburn are both wonderful in this one and the story is heartwarming and funny.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|This is an excellent story of greed revenge and the power of brotherly love winning out over all. Highly recommended
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Adapted from the book and play Pygmalion, originally written by George Bernard Shaw, My Fair Lady stars Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison. It follows a speech therapist (Harrison) as he tries to win a bet that he can pass off a poor flower girl as a duchess. He takes Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) and begins to train her, not as a person but as an experiment. Eliza eventually gets fed up with this treatment but at the same time also wants to become sophisticated. With Harrison's help she does become that person and is no longer a subject to be experimented with. Putting together a good cast, plot, and songs, this film is quite good.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|love the album, although many do not, slightly over produced. but the songs are great and there is a consistant vibe thoughout whole album.
B00ALKPTFA|5.0|I have read it. And I have passed it forward.<br />Now could be a good moment for you to grab it.<br />Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm so addicted to this show!  I can't wait to watch all if the episodes and be ready for next season.
0142419400|5.0|I loved this book so much that after purchasing the kindle edition, I ordered the paperback for myself and another one as a gift for a friend. Anna's witty voice, her banter with Etienne, their back stories and their love... it was all real and raw and good. Paris, family drama, your first real love... Steph Perkins captures all of it with detail and freshness. I couldn't put it down. One of the better books I've read recently--I highly recommend it. Definitely one of my favorites, now.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|arived fast,build quality is superb,you can disassemble just anything with this set,I recomend this product ,I will use this product for looong time!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story and well told. Mr Baldacci has won me back as a devoted fan. Will read The Hit next.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A very engaging and dynamic series. Really like the characters and storyline. Enjoy the chemistry between the two main characters and the cases are different from what is the TV saturated with. Great writing and acting.
B008CRC506|5.0|There aren't many shows I watch religiously.....but this was certainly one of them.  I couldn't wait to see what the next week would bring. When the first season aired, I was working an evening shift so I was unable to watch them right away. I had PVR'd them all season and when my work contract was over, I sat down and started watching them.....and couldn't stop.  LOVED this show and was excited to see season 2. Now I'm very sad to see it won't be returning but I will be getting my long over-due copy of season 1 soon so I can at least relive the magic. In my opinion, there are too many reality shows, too many games shows, too many crime/violent shows on TV.  This show was wonderfully light and always made me forget reality, even if just for that hour. I fell in love with the characters and was rooting for them every week! I am still hoping that somehow it will be back next year, but I won't hold my breath. So many good shows go before their time because of bad decisions. Unfortunately, this is another one of them.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|This one was really good but it was kind of boring at a few points. The ending wasn't as thrilling as I thought it would be but it was a satisfying read. I liked The Long Walk and The Running Man more though. It was better than Rage though I'll give it that. It was nice of him to portray what would happen when someone realizes they are about to lose not just thier home but also thier job and thier marriage. Some people can go a little far to try and stop thier home from being destroyed. This isn't a horror novel this is a novel about human emotions and how too much pressure can drive you over the edge.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|You pick your background (there are several to choose from) and then you pick your layout (you have several of them to choose from, as well) -- Mahjong lover's will simply love this app!! &lt;3 8-)
B003XE3G0Q|2.0|I'm very disappointed in the product.  I have narrower feet and I can only get these to fit me if I have a sock on with it.  I'm just going to use them for gardening shoes and chalk this up don't believe all the hype.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Love it would like to see another film made at least using the military guys. This is volume three in the series.
145210655X|3.0|This is strictly a book of cartoons.  There is no story line really.  The cartoons are very nice though.  Probably  best suited as a coffee table book.
B0095P33IW|4.0|It kept me going i would like to see more,  I use to read when i was A child Hope to see More
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It goes without saying...... I purchased the 1st and 2nd season on DVD and have preordered the 3rd season.  I've read the books and now can put my imagination to view.  My era for reading.  Game of Thrones is Captivating and exciting.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This is a beefy unit that performs well. Note- It does NOT come with two fans even though some pictures show it. Second Note- Be prepared to remove the motherboard as it doesn't just pop in. Third- The instructions are practically worthless, youtube video is much better. Fourth- Better measure your case. Mine barely fit.
B005I0DV4Y|4.0|A feel good movie. That description alone would not do it justice. It is a Maori story but with universal themes. The young must be taught the old ways but by our rules. The young always want to take risks, cut corners and have fun. It is also about death, the natural order of the dying of the light. The erosion of communities that disintegrate under the pace of 'change'-and the loss of things which will never be so again. But will the challenge put down be picked up and what will it look like for the next generation? I much preferred Ngati- a rougher, low cost production and set in an older time-well a time when New Zealand appeared to stand still but more in keeping with the story of my own community. The loss of industry, the shafting of workers for no better purpose than greed by those so far away from the damage they caused it was an obscenity. But whale rider-is uplifting. The cinematography is superb; the acting pretty damn good. The humour-a blessing and in plentiful supply. It has taken awhile for something Maori mainstream to come close to this but the recent 'Matariki' does. Good companions.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very interesting and at times hard to comprehend the mind of this character.  Never a dull moment.  This author will be missed.  I loved the first book and intend to read the third shortly. These stories are not for the weak spirited.. I have learned sometimes<br />it is worth playing with fire or kicking the hornets nest myself.  I do not care for tattoos at all but can identify with the main<br />characters tribute to her experiences.  Good read!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This was a great novel.  Victor Hugo has a gift for making you want to keep on reading.  I learned a lot about French history, but I was mainly enthralled by the characters, and kept wanting more.<br />I have never seen the play or the movie, even though I have heard some of the music.<br />Now, the pieces I have heard fit into place.
B000DZIGE4|5.0|Excellent classic Vietnam Conflict Movie. Good to have my own DVD copy of this movie. 5 stars. It's good to have my own copy of this movie.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I'm old school still. It is almost playing the arcade games that I love to play. Very fast....
B00846WWVM|3.0|it ran out of levels to play.  I actually liked this game...but it abruptly ended.  (May have been a good thing so I don't let it take over my life!)
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I heard this amazing song on the radio and Shazammed it. By the time I got home I forgot. I must have Shazammed it a few more times and realized I had numerous tags. I finally checked it out and after listening to two samples I thought, &#34;This is a no brainer.&#34; I bought it and have listened to the whole album only two times and songs are running though my soul. Brittany Howard's voice is deeply soulful and true. The music is rare and authentic. This is an amazing band and incredible music.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I don't even know how to play this.  I tried looking for the &#34;how to&#34; instructions after the initial download and I couldn't find it.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|it ok, but to darker to hard to see make me not happy, they need fit update again not be darker.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its fun and addictive but impossible to progress without forking out some cash. Wish it didn't try and make you spam your facebook.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I give this product four stars because it's easy to use and keeps track of my calulations so I don't have to.  It does all kinds of math problems and never needs batteries.  I have it on my kindle so I can take it anywhere I go.  I can even tally my grocery bill with ease and confidence.  I would recommend this product to anyone who does not like to figure in their head.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! I play it on my computer but actually prefer to play on my kindle. Lots of fun.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|THIS IS A BRAND NEW DVD SET AND WE ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO WATCH IT. IT CAME AS SOON AS IT WAS RELEASED AND AT THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE. GO AMAZON!!!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Price is affordable for rental and the movie was good. Would recommend customers to sign up for Amazon Prime, it's worth it
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best thing ever! there is creative and survival that have monsters in it if you chose to. in survival there are animals. this is worth buying.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter and I read the books and loved this just as much. Good watch can not wait until the second one comes out
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|In an effort to bring clarity to my life, I've been reading plenty of similar titles, and I'm happy to say that this one delivers the goods. It's practical and inspirational and not complex at its core, but it's written very intelligently and I think everyone from homemakers to top executives can relate to it. A very enthusiastIc recommendation for this gem!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|The kids really liked this movie however I found it hard to watch over and over. Normally I enjoy watching movies with them. This one was a tough one tho. I was happy we only had it for 48hrs.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|What a refreshing read! The characters in this book were people I could relate to - there were no hero's, no villains, no impossibly glamorous leads - it was a book that took me on a journey, and I did not know where I would end up. I felt the lead characters hopes and fears - saw things developing and wanted different outcomes at different times. I felt it was well-researched, thought provoking and sensitive. I am now about to start more of Jojo Moyes' work as a result. Highly recommended.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Awesome movie.  Tom Hardy was fabulous; my new favorite tough guy.  Great, great story.  This and Winter's Bones seem close to the same area of the country during different time periods.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|I thought the movie, Yossi, played out very well.  The only thing that bothered me was it's tentativeness, Yossi, forever overlooking the come-ons of people in his life and capitulating to the 'final' offer only at the end of the film! I could not believe he was so naive to see these 'come-ons'but obviously he was?  I would recommend itand it would have been a 5 star one (IMO)had it shown more love scenes between him and Tom.
0061900656|3.0|We purchased 3 big brother books at the same time. I had completely forgotten about this one because it was not a hit. The book is good, and tells a story, but my 20-month-old just doesn't love it. He does love &#34;In Mother's Lap&#34; and &#34;My New Baby&#34;. I have found with these types of books you have to get a bunch and try them to see which one will help your child.
B00908DDZM|5.0|CD<br /><br />Great service and it had the song on it that I was looking for.  The product was in great shape from the shipping.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|There so great reviews here so I just add great action movie. When is the third installment due? Count me in.
B005I0DUMC|5.0|Great film with a grocery list of A-list actors (in the 90's). The plot doesn't have many twists but the storyline is complicated yet compelling. Stalone does a great job in this role, not to mention Harvey Keitel and Ray Liota. Worth a watch!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played the first TR many times. TR2 added features and design make this game better and increase the entertaining game play. Our family enjoys it, especially on trips.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I grew up on this record...well, all three LPs. Wings Over America, in my opinion, is the crown jewel of all McCartney releases. The performances, especially on Rock Show, Maybe I'm Amazed, Silly Love Songs, and I've Just Seen A Face are stellar, but you knew that already because you listened to this record thirty-something years ago. However, I was so disappointed at the mastering. There is very little, if any, improvement over what my vinyl sounds like. It is no better than listening to music over AM radio. That being said, because of the strong performance, the nostalgia that comes along with the songs, and the slight improvements, it earns 4 out of my 5 stars.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|the humor involved and the chemistry between the two main actors is priceless. I would recommend for a ladies night.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read such terrible reviews of this and had so looked forward to seeing it. I am a fan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, so I had high expectations. We loved it! Yes, the technology used in the storyline is dated. This is not Star Wars; it is faithful to the original story. Don't expect graphic computer-explosions. The kids love it and so do the grandparents, and we watch it over and over again.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It seems like Charlaine Harris took the easy route to ending the series by avoiding vampires in this book for the most part. However, Dead Ever After provides the usual murder mystery and most of the main characters of the series get a decent sendoff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app this amazingly awesome and addicting! You would have to run from the inspector, and dodge trains so he won't catch yah!! This app is a MUST HAVE. Its really fun, and once in a while they would hqve new updates in different places!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The movie is a little slow progressing at first but quickly picks up.  Keeps you wondering what will happen next and quite honestly makes you think a little harder about taking a prescription pill for this or that.  Pretty good overall but I was a little disappointed in the ending.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|Controls are a bit hard but you get used to it. Great game, multiplayer would be a bonus, also more environments need to be added if you want to charge money for it. Other than that it has good graphics, its fun, and it is challenging.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I recommend the book highly, especially to those with good &#34;computer-speak&#34; skills, as that aspect of the book was a little beyond me.  However, the book was well-written with witty dialogue and lots of fun and wizard-like characters.
0765367351|2.0|I love books. I love video games. I have a special fondness for Bioshock - I remember when I first finished the game, I felt like its story easily rivaled some of my favorite science fiction books, and I feel the same way about Bioshock Infinite. Much as I've always felt that writing books based on video games is a horrible idea, I made an exception for Bioshock. I now wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Rapture the book doesn't read like a book - it reads like a video game rewritten in book form - and while this may seem like a good thing, it works horribly. There's no added depth - every setting in the book is lifted from the video game - from the names of the establishments to descriptions of businesses. Character thoughts and motivations are explained via descriptions of characters recording themselves on the audio recording devices scattered throughout Rapture - with the recordings lifted verbatim from the game. Random characters from the video game appear, then disappear suddenly, as if they were never meant to be elaborated upon.<br /><br />One impressionable moment in the video game involves sneaking up on a splicer talking to what seems like a baby - what is eventually revealed to be a handgun. In the book, splicers are never described beyond a basic one-dimensional character. What could've been an excellent opportunity to elaborate on a critical element of the city is completely ignored - instead, most of the book centers around Bill McDonagh, a character that ultimately comes off annoying.<br /><br />Books and video games are both excellent media, for reasons that are completely distinct. Rapture could've been an excellent book - if it wasn't so bent on lifting content from the video game; instead, concentrating on the narrative. It does no such thing, however, and suffers greatly as a result. Ultimately, I found that another Bioshock playthrough was infinitely more satisfying than the 400+ pages of inaneness and one-dimensionality that this book put me through. On a positive note, at least it was what I expected.a positive note, at least it was what I expected.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's Facebook.. Lol. I have the kindle fire HD. And works perfectly fine. My daughter however has the cruz tablet t301 and it doesn't work on hers...also have this app on both iPod touches 4 and its great.

B008N1V11U|5.0|Ok I I am so not into like super hero stuff. Or video games for that matter.. but because of the reviews ,I got this. And I have to say it's pretty good. It follows the story line of the movie,  the dark knight rises, and the graphics are ps2 graphics. It's crazy to see such good graphics in a mobile game.<br />I got this app and spent a few min getting used to the controls. I played may be an hour. The next day same thing played about N hour. Than my daughter who is 11 came in an  I showed her the game....n my boyfriend who is 28  I showed him the game.... ya know i I have not got to play it since! Lol those lil buggerz took over my game. They love it so much they honestly play until the battery dies...<br />From the little bit of time they aloud me to play (lol,) I seen that there are missions to fulfill N u can buy weapons and armor. Also I was told by my bf that he was looking for the batmoblie. So I guess u can even drive it!!<br />Any batman fanatic. Or even super hero geek should love this game. I haven't got to play much like I said, so I do not know much yet on what u can do.. I know he flyes and beats ppl up..:)  n cat women and that man with the messy face is in the game  too..
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Michael Scott is an excellent writer, and has woven a lot of research and many fascinating facts about a real-life historical figure, the alchemist Nicholas Flamel, into a fast-moving, magic-filled adventure. But as you read, you have no idea which things are fact and which fiction - because everything is woven together so skillfully.  The characters are thoroughly rounded, real and just as quirky as one would like them to be. Best fantasy I have read in a long time. Am making my way through the second book in the series as we speak. I give this my personal seal of approval.  It is also SO refreshing to read a book that has no distracting errors of grammar or typographical errors!  As the quality of published books overall sinks, an imaginative book like this rises to the very top.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I guess it's ok. Not something you'll get addicted to though. The police don't play. If they have to then they will run you over or shoot you multiple times. The graphics are fair and balanced. There's also some inappropriate stuff in there too. I mostly use it as a time killer like when I'm at the doctor or something. All in all on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 5 or 6. Worth 5 bucks.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Let me preface this with a disclaimer: I did NOT like Aurora Teagarden, I wasn't fond of Lily Bard, and I loathed Harper Connelly. So, when I was given a three-fer of the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE MYSTERIES by Charlaine Harris, well . . . I was in the hospital at the time and any book was preferable to NO book.<br /><br />Imagine my pleased surprize and delight, then, with Sookie Stackhouse. Wow. Just, WOW. A steel magnolia in training, with the added difficulty of being a telepath? With vampires that weren't prettied up, supernatural elements of all sorts, and, eventually, the entire pantheon of supernatural and supranatural creatures and beings? Hoo boy - I fell in love and haven't fallen OUT of love with this quirky, insane at times and thoroughly entertaining series. I'm like any other rabid fan: I wanted it to go on and on and ON forever. So, like any other rabid fan, I was upset at Mrs. Harris's decision to end the series and move on to something else, while at the same time I was eagerly anticipating the ending. Would Sookie get her HEA? Who would it be with? What about Sam - does he get over being dead and resurrected? And Tara and JB? And the villains, of course: what was going to happen to them? Steve Newlin/Fellowhip of the Sun? Felipe, the King of Louisiana, Arkansas and Nevada? Her cousin Claude in jail in Faery? What happened to him? How about the other characters? How about the Eric/Freyda mess - how is THAT going to be resolved, or is it?<br /><br />So MANY questions - and all of them answered. All of the storylines crafted throughout the series were ended. NOT neatly, no, but in my opinion satisfactorily. While I wasn't exactly pleased with some of the endings, they were logical within the framework of the world that Mrs. Harris crafted. The characters were true to themselves and their back stories, the plot lines and story lines were consistent with the internal logic of the universe, and it was, to me, an altogether satisfying read.<br /><br />DEAD EVER AFTER is, at times, incoherent because the action and dialogue jumps around from person to person and place to place. It is, at times, a bit hard to follow. It also, at times, makes no logical sense until you've read the entire book at least twice. Fortunately, with a book, you can do that. That's one of the most wonderful things ABOUT a book, it's always there to be read, re-read and savoured. While I was surprized in a good many places with this one, I was also delighted.<br /><br />Which is why I was so unpleasantly surprized when I read the newspaper reviews of the book. Almost without exception, they were scathing. AND rude. When I read the Amazon reviews, I was appalled at the reaction of most of the reviewers. When I read the interview that Mrs. Harris gave, I was not only appalled, I was - well, angry. Apparently, Mrs. Harris has gotten death threats for her endings. It seems that her fans were just as fickle and as rude as the troos of another urban fantasy writer, only her fans were threatening her with mayhem and murder simply because she didn't write the ending that *they* wanted and felt that they deserved.<br /><br />Death threats? REALLY?<br /><br />I think what everybody has lost sight of here is that these books are Mrs. Harris's creations, the people that inhabit her world are *her* children, and that, unlike some other alleged writers I could name, she has always been aware that they are fictional and not actually real people. Even the books that she's written that I wasn't real fond of have had an internal logic that has been followed faithfully. The rules of her universes have been consistent, her character development has been both logical and consistent, the storylines have been good (even if I didn't much care for them) and basically she's followed her own rules. The characters are always developing and growing which I think is important.<br /><br />Now, does the fan base have the right to complain? Of course they do. I myself have complained on occasion when an author that I have enjoyed in the past has taken a direction that I didn't care for. RIVER MARKED by Patricia Briggs is one of the books that almost put me completely off both the author and the series. WAKING THE WITCH by Kelley Armstrong is another one. I found it very hard to like either one of these books because the author took a differing point of view from the one that I expected and thought should be taken. OK, they were bridge books but I didn't like them and I was quite vocal about my dislike. However, complaining about a direction that I don't like is NOT - repeat, NOT - the same thing as threatening the author because said author didn't do what you wanted them to do.<br /><br />Back to DEAD EVER AFTER: I never liked Eric Northman. Not even a little bit. He was abusive to everybody around him. He used Sookie as if she was an object - after all, she was nothing but a mostly human person, not important to him - until he decided that he needed to have her as a sex object. He tricked her into a marriage that she didn't want to one-up his new king (although he did that to \\"keep her safe\\"), he ordered her around like a slave, he never really appreciated her for just herself - and, despite her stated wish to NOT be turned, he was contemplating that anyhow. He tried to make her into a kept woman, again against her wishes, and got angry with her when she declined the \\"honour\\". Control freak, much, Eric? I must confess that it gave me an inordinate amount of pleasure when his life finally caught up with him and he was forced into the same position that he tried to force Sookie into.<br /><br />Sookie's HEA was not what I expected, at all - and I loved it. Her HEA was not what everybody wanted, oh, no. However, it's the one that she secretly wanted and got. Not every woman in the world has to have a protector or even really wants one. Full circle back to mostly human but also recognition of her own worth as a person. One is, after all, a whole number.<br /><br />I'm sorry that Mrs. Harris is having such a hard time, and I hope that all of the angry fans get over themselves.<br /><br />They need to.n occasion when an author that I have enjoyed in the past has taken a direction that I didn't care for.

B002CAWNEM|2.0|Not good acting, except for the woman who was obsessed. The plot was not well constructed. Why she chose this man to be obsess with?
0307887960|4.0|the only thing  i didnt like about the book it didnt give to munch about protien product ,(what to eat} other wise it was agreat book gave me good  information  (i need to lose 10lbs lost 5 haven a hard time for the rest any sudjuston  thank you donna
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you have a lot of time to read this is a very fine book but it takes a lot of time to get thru it because it is complicated and It takes the author along time to get all the points across, but, at least for me, it was worth the time..
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT P.E. VERSION is simply made by Mohan.and is one of the best minecraft. As Xbox360 version p.e. version has a travel twist and plus things which have never been created by Mohan studios. So in my opinion if you have $7.00 then go head buy the game! Trust me you will not regret it! :) add me on xbox360 or my server is as: FunnyPups1234
0670026638|5.0|A very unusual story for a &#34;Western&#34; reader. Sometimes not aways easy reading but filled with fascinating I formation about a culture and people we know too little about. This book made me wish Japan, and other eastern countries were more a part of our education. There is a lot we could learn from their ancient habits and knowledge acquired over the many centuries they have existed. Certainly well worth the time and concentration needed to put it in the &#34;read&#34; column.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is the new update for minecraft pocket edition I can't get any mods I tried<br />To get the tnt arrows mod
B00947N6D8|5.0|i absolutely love this movie! i truely believe it will be a classic, i like how they portray the new age mythical beings; fun and hip. totally entertaining
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|I decided to rewatch this after seeing the new Star Trek in the theater and as a Trekkie I feel like I have to give it 4 stars. It brought back memories of watching Star Trek with my parents - my mom oogling Kirk and my dad being fascinated by the special effects and space travel.  But if I were brand new to the franchise, watching this for the first time in 2013, I don't think I would have liked this movie at all!  LOL!! The special effects are laughable and the storyline is so weird it's comical.  The dialogue seemed forced - it was clear, the cast really hadn't melded yet.<br /><br />Bottom line - the trekkies will love this movie no matter what but for the newbies out there - suffer through this one, I promise everything gets better in later movies!! LOL!!
B00A83075M|5.0|I love this movie! very funny and creative.  I like Vanelope's character and her sarcastic humor. fun for adults and kids alike!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|action sequences are same old that you probably have watched 100 times in Bond movies or any other thrillers. Okay movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|update whenever u have a chance because its amazing and keep an eye out for the new subway surfer Miami that is coming to us soon :)  &lt;3  &infin;  ^.^
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Loved the slightly different animation type, thought the storyline was well put together so that both kids and adults could enjoy it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I've barely played a fraction of the Mahjong sets in this app, but I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. Like the background images, too.
193700788X|4.0|Not the ending I expected..... But I was happy and satisfied with sookie's farewell!  Would definitely recommend this book for any sookie fans
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every single one of his books I just hate waiting for the next one. Great terrorist plots and twists.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I'm a huge Daft Punk fan and this album more than met expectations. The use of live music instead of synthesizers give this album a refreshing air about it and the homage to legendary techno pioneer Georgio was wonderful.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Thought it was slow to respond, and took up a lot of space. Should be free, the free one was just as good but limited to two locations.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|A fast paced, good-looking arcade game. Game play is simple, just drag your finger across the screen to shoot the bad guys, collect your power ups, and avoid enemy fire. Highly reminiscent of Galaga, this game is simple and highly addictive.<br /><br />About the only problems that I have with this game are caused by external factors. The always there virtual buttons on my Nexus 4 mean that I can sometimes accidentally invoke Google Now and get pulled out of the game. And there are times when for some reason the Amazon App Store loses my credentials and I have to log back into it before I can play again.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|This game is too slow.  The time frames to make any kind of progress are whack!  I also hate apps that nag you to post crap all over yours and your friends' Facebook pages.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I love the extended version.  It's MUCH better watching the extended than the regular--the regular seems more disjointed somewhat.  the extended makes the story move more seamlessly; much more organic for sure.  The visual effects are just amazing. The characters are great, I'm certainly glad there's more to come! :)
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This is good background music while working. Subdued but catchy. Would recommend if you like alternative music bands. Two thumbs up.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|My only regret is not being able to be counted among the fans of this show when it originally aired though it would just have just prolonged the pain of knowing that there will never be more episodes!  At least they did the movie to wrap it up, however it doesn't take away the want of more episodes!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I have never heard of this band. Found while I was cruising offerings on Amazon.com for some new tunes to download. Really like the music, although I find the lead singer's voice to be a bit odd. Would recommend this.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game so much. I just wish there were even more puzzles. It is very addictive! Give it a try.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I really love this band. Their lyrics speak to me. I am an Ohioan and as such, enjoy this band that originated in C-bus OH.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Plenty of playing time with great graphics and story. Hints were helpful and needed a few times. Looking forward to more Big Fish games.
B002JIBA8W|5.0|Great movie. Would watch it again. Loved it. Great everything. Loved it. Didn't get bored at any time during the movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|pretty dang good RPG. enjoy the functionality and simplicity of it. Plenty of action and a storyline to boot. Two monster thumbs up!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|What more can I say? I really enjoy the random things David writes about and the way he expresses himself. This was a pleasant escape from my suburban prison.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|The glass cutter is easy to put together and works well.  I just need to refine the actual cracking the glass apart step.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have found this to be quite enjoyable. It is a great game for me when I am having trouble going to sleep. Wears my brain out.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|I have a problem knowing which CD to play.  There are so many of them that I found playing them was difficult not knowing which ones I would enjoy most.  I can't tell which ones were most well known, etc.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Love Sacha Baron Cohen, but this I have to say was his worse movie yet! It had its humorous moments, but overall not a good film!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Star Trek is simply an incredibly fun and entertaining science fiction series, though it was hardly appreciated back in the 1960's when it originally aired. Fortunately, it lives on today in re runs, giving Trekkies the ongoing excitement of regularly 'boldly going where no man has gone before'. Live long and prosper, everyone!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I used my free 500 coins to buy this game and it was worth it. When more rooms are released I will definitely buy.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Ok, so the fact that I can whiten my teeth in pictures before I post them to Facebook is freaking awesome. Seriously. Who needs whitening strips now? Unless of course I have to see someone face to face. Unfortunately, there's NOT an app for that.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I read the first two. Didn't think I would like it, but it kept me interested. Can't wait for the next one.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Although some of Sacha Baron Cohen's stuff is funny, I was surprised how poor the production quality was on this movie.  It appears they spent more on TV ads for the movie than on the actual movie itself.  And he tries to be a bit serious and fails pretty poorly at it.  Definitely not his best work.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Read his book, and can tell who each song is about. He's back as a song writer. Sounds like the old Rod I've always loved.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very cool not great graphics but it's still a good game. I would like the game to have a multi player.
193700788X|1.0|It seemed like the author forgot MOST of the series in relation to how the characters were written in this book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is so much fun and very addicting for me I love this game a lot even though you have to pay to unlock the rest of the game it is still fun
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this game and it doesn't get boring after a while because every month there is a change of the country.... at the moment we are in Tokyo!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it was awasome but it just got froze and it never worked sense.please fix this game it was awsome but now everytime I try to play it always goes back to the kindle home menu
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just gotta say damn good book!!!!! I mean who wouldnt wanna have sex all the time??? Anytime, any place, anywhere even lol. Minus the control freakery, I'd love, do, or say anything for this guy if he was in my life.<br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it makes you want to have a party. I love it so much. that is why I gave it five stars<br />&cent;:
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was disappointed with the way the book ended; not sure it made sense and had no feeling of reality.  Book did keep my interest.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved this one!  Compelling and inspiring.  The personal growth that Cheryl Strayed went through and shared was incredible.  Hope she's written another one!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It is great especially for me I have vision problems and this one takes care of that.  Thanks again it is wonderful!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Had to read it for school bit overall I did enjoy it. Ending was a surprise. Nonetheless it kept me entertained.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|The accents are terrible and this movie seemed like it borrowed heavily from an old movie called 'Set It Off' but it was still pretty good. The Town didn't bore me to tears like most movies do.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Who doesn't love this classic? Sure, it has its cheesy moments, but they are endearing. Those us that are crayze for Swayze will always love it. We were raised on it. It's what pubescent fantasies were built on and realities are compared to (even if only just a little).
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I'm a big fan of mysteries and thrillers.  They are not produced often now, and I'm always on the lookout for a new one. This one moves along nicely, a few twists and turns.  Actors are all competent. Given how few movies I like lately, this one was fun to watch.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It's a very morbid show<br />But the way it's handled turns it in to art<br />I really can't explan it<br />But I loved the show and now I'm following it on NBC
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books even though there was much sadness in them. I'm happy that Katniss and Peeta ended up together but so sad about all those who died.
B0007X9T5M|5.0|I just finished watching the DVD and am now listening to the CD of Dido Live.  I have always enjoyed listening to her studio CDs, but watching the DVD from this live performance completely captured my attention in a different way.  First of all, her band, which includes both a percussionist and a drummer, as well as a guitarist, a bassist, and a keyboardist, was excellent, and  flat out jammed throughout the concert.  Secondly, Dido's personal attachment to all of the songs was quite obvious, due in part to her poignant introductions to many of them.  Thirdly, her live performance was very natural, free from any pretension or staged choreography, which was very enjoyable.  Lastly, if you are not familiar with Dido, but like Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries, you will love this compilation.  Highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I highly enjoy the Quell games.  Good PUZZLES<br /> you can gradually work on, no TIMERS, great for doing while relaxing, cooking, watching TV.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is one of my most favorite seasons of doctor who! :D I really enjoyed it, but I had to look else were for the last three episodes of this season. Amazon please work on this.
B006CA9ANK|5.0|Never written a review for an album before.  At least not where everyone can see it.  I feel this one is worth talking about, though, because it's absolutely beautiful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|how does one get to Miami?<br />I  play on the tablet every day and do the daily challenge every day .... I only play sporadically on my phone,  yet I'm in Miami on said phone and still in Tokyo on the kindle. can someone shed some light?
B003WKOU0G|3.0|Wonderful cinematography, but I was slightly disappointed by the lack of narration.  Otherwise, great story.  I'm sure babies would like the babies on screen as well.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|This is a must! I was home brewing for about a month before reading this.  After reading the joy of home brewing I have such a stronger understanding of the overall brewing process and the rich history that comes with it. Don't delay and buy right now!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This program has exceeded my expectations.  Rather than playing for up to an hour (like most others), I was amazed that I woke up after a restful night's sleep to the &#34;sounds of the night&#34;, which put me to sleep.  This program offers 50 different sounds which include white noise, wind surge, urban rain, waterfalls, flute, thunder, ocean, train and many other soothing sounds to lull you to sleep.  And it was FREE.  I highly recommend &#34;Relax Melodies Premium&#34;.  I downloaded this program on my Kindle Fire, plugged it into an outlet and let it go for the night.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me....he's just excellent in all his movies & &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; is no exception.  I find him an awesome actor & I try to see all his movies.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|i read a lot and this was a very interesting book, have since read a couple others of this authors and really liked them so have been looking for more of hers.  Well worth picking up.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved the series. I can't wait for the sixth book to come out. Fans of the show will find countless hours of pleasure with these books.
B000YRY8BG|4.0|A very good British drama with an excellent cast.  The British State of Play series is far superior than the American movie remake.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I started a reef for my kids an  each day they wan  to check on it. They love the fact that it's Memo and they seem all f th  other characters. It's farmville done Disney style an  that in itself make  it addicting.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|My 10 and 7 year old grand kids liked it but it isn't anything most adults would like but it was just OK.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|this book is dark and emotional and really interesting, with lots of twists throughout the book.  I read this in paperback then bought it on my kindle to reread!
B000FA675C|5.0|The DaVinci Code has been one of my favorites since it came out. It's a book that picks you up and sweeps you away. Before you know it, six hours has passed and it's three a.m and you can't put it down.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|i have always liked this movie since I was younger and I think it is a great movie for older age kids and adults.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This best album I've heard in years!!!!  You don't have to be an AIC fan to see the greatness in this album. I did love Black gives way to Blue but TDPDH smokes it...twice!  I felt that William Duvall was held back on BGWTB but he gets turned loose on this effort. Jerry Cantrell's guitar work is inspired and shows just how great he is.  I always felt that Jerry was was overlooked in his musical talent but if can't see that he is he the driving force in AIC with these songs, there is something wrong wrong your brain. The harmonies are so good, you want to keep playing this disc over and over to hear the guys sing while playing great music. That is an art that is lost in so many ways in current music. This is a real album, don't chop it up. Play it from start to finish, the songs are in the order to take you on ride to enjoy. Just another part of Cantrell's unreal craftmanship as an artist. Look, just get this disc and see how awesome it is. I really can't tell you how great this album is, I don't have the words. The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here stands on it's own as one of the great albums of all time!!!
B00CRW2066|5.0|I always look forward to a new National release and they always put on a good live show.  One of my favorite bands, for sure.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I bought this not having listened to any of it purely by the name.<br />Thought maybe I'd have another Homework or Human After All.<br />Then I get drums and guitar and auto-tuned robot voice.<br />The girlfriend liked it so I gave it to her. I wasn't having any of it.<br />I think it's suppose to be a retro style album but TO ME this isn't cutting it.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|Found Daughter by accident and have since scooped up everything I can find from them. Hope they're around for a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I absolutely love it. I play it, my sister plays it and we both think this game is awesome.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read WONDER. I loved that book so much that my whole family wants or wanted to. GREAT BOOK!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was so much better than I expected. It was smart and funny, disturbing and a real page turner! The characters and relationships became much more interesting than I expected at first. When I was about a third of the way in, I didn't understand how the book wasn't almost over, then it just turned and grabbed me and had my attention to the end! What amazingly messed up people in this story!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My 7 year old daughter wanted this game but I love playing it too, I play it more than she does I think. Reminds me of Mario.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|My first glimpse of this movie was when Dr. Phil interviewed the two main stars. As much as I love Dr. Phil, I walked away not expecting a lot from Guilt Trip and virtually forgot about it.  One rainy day as I looked through Amazon's movie selections I stumbled across it and decided to give it a go.  I would have given it 4.5 stars, if I could.  The interaction between mother and son is priceless and relatable, but my walkaway was the message that we can spend precious time feeling sad, bad, guilty, or any host of emotion over something in our past that is not true, but only in our perception or imagination. Things are exactly how they should be.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Did not think I would like a book from a dog's perspective, but I really did enjoy the book.  It was funny, sad and really enjoyed the ending which made me wonder!  There were parts about auto racing, human relationships and what a dog might think like.  Really good read in my opinion.
B000MF4O82|3.0|and set up Port Joe Smith deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Too late they realized that Datana had already been chosen by other colonists -- Arachnids.<br /><br />Amazing opening.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes are really interesting, but then after that it's more of a shoot'em up kind of a tale (which bores me). The shoot'em up element though is sort of the point, since the film captures the stupidity of war and how easily youth are seduced into fights that don't benefit them at all.<br /><br />So I get that . . . but more plot would have been great anyway.<br /><br />Still worth a watch.<br /><br />For some reason I hear The Ramones Blitzkrieg Bop -- when I think of this film.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|There are those of us (so called Americans), who believe that we are ahead of other countries. Sorry, this has not been true for some time. The light will be shed on much which was thought/believed to be written in stone for us (Americans)...you will get angry, but reality does that to people. Come out of the &#34;fog&#34; people; Outsourcing is real, also.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I had a really Good experience shopping from Amazon. ANKER CAR CHARHER has really Good quality and it arrive in 2 days. The customer service of Amazon and ANKER was outstanding. They had put all there effort in helping with my order. Would definitely come back to shop again. Everyone should buy this. It is very useful for your car
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have been extremely busy with work and school lately, and have gotten my wife hooked on watching this series (we came in on Season # 3), so now we are happily playing catch-up. Great Series.
B000002TLX|5.0|Awesome,Awesome......! I love this album as this also too brought back some really sweet memories for me as the track &#34;Endless summer nights&#34; was the best in those days when i was growing up & starting a real job for the first time. Listening to this man's music puts me into feeling so good about myself & listening to a great voice that i can't help but, some tracks i can't help but, to listen to it again & again. Your the best Richard Marx, if you ever get to see this comment.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|It tells a great story, as in all of Ford's movies, with a terrific cast. Highly recommended for a nice evening on the couch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John keeps challenging himself and us to entertain us through a conflict in today's reality.  Always a pleasure to read
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have all the Beatles music. First it was the 45's and albums, then the CD's and the remasters and finally the mono box set.  One might think that was plenty of Beatle music. It's not.  This release is a musical masterpiece weaving classic Beatle music in a new and exciting way. I haven't even listened to the CD yet as I went straight for the DVD-A. Two words &#34;simply stunning&#34;.  Even if you have as much or more Beatle music as I have this is still an amazing and refreshing addition to anybody's collection.
B00CEQ1JOO|1.0|With special Monster High dolls becoming so rare and so expensive, I was thrilled that I could present my Granddaughter with Twyla for her birthday.  I was impressed with the speed that I received the doll from overseas and that the box was in such good condition.  Amazon hasn't failed me yet!!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Great story. A little sloppy at the end. James Mason appeared at the end when he had gone over the side. Improbable end but a good piece of entertainment. Holds its interest. Not dated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. It's a great app to use if your bored or just want to pass time. I would choose this game over temple run any day:) I love it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I did not actually watch it but my kids really enjoyed it and are bugging me to buy it now.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this game so much! It is challenging and fun! It is the best music game avaliable! I love this app!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|have watched many times before, now I own watch all the time know all the words to songs.  everyone should have
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Great performance and flawless Blu-ray production.  But of course, it is the Eagles so you know it will be awesome.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun and never boring I play alot and i like the new places every month not to mention the boards and characters are cool too
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Is a really good game. It is worth the 7 bucks. A little hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it you will LOVE it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this app so much its awesome with a capital A. Lol anyway you have to get this app you will love love love love it so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|excellent game; every one should have it. fun for everyone to chose the specific type of game. download for a good time.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Such a wonderful movie with a great cast. I knew that I would want to see this movie again. Glad I purchases it! Amazon has fabulous prices!
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Sons of Anarchy is a soap opera with violence, motorcycles and drug cartels. It's one of my favorite shows, can't wait for season five.
B00BCMT4RA|3.0|I kinda remembered this from back in the day. Upon recent purchase...it just isn't there anymore. There are better Albert King CDs from around this time...this is not one  of them. I really like Albert King but you'd be better off finding at least a couple of tunes from this CD on a compilation.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Hugh Jackman sings well, as do the adults, which is more than I can say for the child &#34;star&#34;.  It's going to be a while before I watch this again.
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|Plug into my MacBook Pro (early 2011) running Mac OS 10.8 and finder would not recognize the reader until the driver (easy to find) was installed on my Mac. 4 stars not 5 because of this. The reader and SD card sit perfectly flush with the slot in my MacBook. I found it easy to insert or remove the SD card with the Reader removed from the Mac. Fit is perfect, the reader comes in/out smoothly.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This series of Batman movies contains some of the best action of the SuperHero flicks.  However, this one is plagued by Bruce Wayne wimpiness at the beginning of the movie.  When he finally gets into it, his machines are awesome and the action is fabulous.
B005HEPN06|5.0|What's not to love? I'm glad I can watch it online whenever I want.  I just wish Amazon would add the HD version of all seasons.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Craig is one of the best Bonds since Sean. The action scenes are spectacular and the story line sets you up for more to come had to add it to my Complete Bond Collection
0767817478|5.0|This movies is a roller coaster. Parts action, parts thrills and parts funny. The actors are all good and the monster is crafty. I will say I was sad to see the fate of Godzilla.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Got this as a free ap of the day and prefer it to almost any streaming audio ap.  Huge selection of shows and stationsas well as easy interface.  The only thing that sucks about it is that about once a week or so, it tells me that it won't work unless I log back into Amazon Ap Store--a PITA at six in the morning when I'm just trying to catch the traffic and get a shower.
B000HZGBLA|5.0|She is so cute, beautiful and tough woman ;)<br />I know why brad Pitt love her,<br />Cuz she is also mistereous woman,<br />Once you met her, it's very difficult not to love her.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Whitney does an outstanding job with her role and Kevin Costner was the perfect match for her.  Together the two are dynamite.  It is a great love story that does not take over the plot but is an underlying electricity.
B009R659L8|5.0|Yes I love Mary Higgins Clark books! I have never been disappointed with any of her books. I really had no idea that the father was really the uncle!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Great flick, Robert Downey is the man! Like the action and the effects. Recommend Iron Man and Iron Man 2
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Little pricy, as it is described, DVD, blu ray and also digital version, not try the ultra violet copy, but this combo meets my need for all my devices. The shipping was fast!
B0084IHVC0|4.0|We needed to replace our VHS copy as this was my daughters favorite movie when she was little.  I think she watched it on repeat!
B000002L9Y|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is a great group- this album was a departure from their bluesie stuff in the early 70's, real fresh. The single, &#34;Tango in the night&#34; is rich-They can really rock when they want. Great price too.
B00866JLEG|5.0|I usually do not like love stories as they often seem to lack any substance.  For some reason this really touched me.  The characters are flawed but redeemable and ultimately do the right thing.  Who knew Zac Efron would turn out to be such a good actor.  I hope we get to see more of him.
B0035JNRXU|5.0|This is the first time I saw this movie. I really enjoyed this. I do enjoy JJ Abrahms new movies but there is something about the ones that keep you interested.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Have always loved the Lion King - now I have it in 3-different formats and I can watch it anywhere!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed at the pace and conclusion. This series as kept me wrapped up and totally hooked. The last book needs a conclusion but also be interesting along the way. It drug on then just ended.
1592332803|5.0|This book has great recipes for the vegan that thinks you have to do without dessert or baked goods!  The recipes are delicious and easy to follow.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great read and really made you think about areas of your life where you could lean in more. Her section about women not literally and figuratively raising their hand made me take a good look at how I conducted myself not only in the workplace, but in life. There are so many times when I don't ask a question- even if it's a simple one - because I  don't want to inconvenience anyone. After reading her book, I've definitely noticed that behavior and started asking questions, or raising my hand, a lot more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this ap! I have using this since I got my kindle over a year ago. Thanks so much for this very graphic ap.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Held our attention and caused many fright moments. Effects were well done and the little actors were so good. Recommend to thriller fans.
B004SIP9Z6|4.0|This is a pretty good version of the SIN CITY comic books. At least they did a pretty decent job of keeping to the basics of the original. But it could have been better.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I've been wanting to see Cloud Atlas since it was in the theaters. The previews looked great. So when I saw it available for download, I was pretty excited. What a great cast! I thought it was going to be awesome.<br /><br />Turned out to be the worst movie ever. I suffered through all 3 hours and am very upset to have lost that time of my life, not to mention the money I wasted. I am amazed at so many good reviews, those that say it's profound and thought provoking. Why? I mean, I get the message -- we relive, over and over, different flesh but same soul, same theme/objective no matter which timeline we're in (Tom Hanks' theme always had to do with poison), and we are always connected to the same souls. Something like that, but really, who cares? None of it was the slightest bit interesting. The characters were all creepy, their lives were unpleasant, and there were so many parallels and actors changing costumes that I was dizzy trying to keep track of everyone. Some of the actors looked too much alike, so I couldn't tell if one was SUPPOSED to be the other, or if they were different people entirely. And every timeline, every parallel, was filled with misery. Yup, that's how I want to spend my Friday night, trying to shake film-induced manic depression.<br /><br />What's more, this movie was violent and bloody. Lots of senseless gore. I hate gore. There was nothing in the previews to indicate that it would be gory. It was like someone tried to think up all the things that would create shock factor and put them all into one movie.<br /><br />Okay, I guess I can go on and on, but you get the point. Awful, horrible film. Great actors but nothing good to work with. If you are still destined to see it for yourself, wait a while. I will bet it'll become free on Netflix or Amazon Prime very soon.
3836501899|3.0|My husband thought it was pretty cool...he hasn't had a chance to study it much yet.  He is a photographer and an Adjunct that teaches photography at a local Community College.
B00BLCHYKU|1.0|Good bad guy and bad bad guy. Not interested. Brother hits on brothers wife right off the bat. Not interested.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game always fun! Way better than the game Hill Racer. But could use some more vehicles because on my phone I have every vehicle.
B0046JLTCE|5.0|I could say soooo much about 5FDP but they aint enough time. They are awesome,awesome,awesome buy them all!!!!! Metal to the core!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's the first time I have played anything like this puzzle. I loved it..it made you think and has a strange story too. Hope I can find some more like this..way to go!!
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This movie has been my husband's favorite for years! Hard to repeat one like this! It leaves with you with the strive to do your best and appreciate everything you have!
B009NY43NY|5.0|A wonderful end to a fantastic series! It wrapped up the characters and moved everything in a fun direction. Great job Charlaine Harris!
B008602KQI|3.0|Nice start though a little slow and then into the start of the game was very engrossing.  Then somewhere around the two third mark the movie lost it's way and tried to be to many things.  Would she be a hero, who did she really love, was she a leader, was she the real winner or was it handed to her for political reasons etc... .<br /><br />The movie suffers from bad timing and direction.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Very rare James Bond movie that isn't included in any sets for a good price and quick shipping.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I really need to stop buying Gameloft games<br /><br />everytime you open this game there is a full page ad plus there is no exit button<br /><br />plus there are ads under each buying screen its ate up with them just ruins the game immersion<br /><br />gameloft has just become one very money hungry company anymore they used to make good games but that has been lost recently<br /><br />perhaps they will have a management change and go back to making good games until then  beware<br /><br />deleted from kindle fire hd after a few hours not worth your time<br /><br />and on a side note it doesn't auto flip either
B00005ABTT|5.0|Very rare James Bond movie that isn't included in any sets for a good price and quick shipping.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is addictive. I purchased it for my daughter but often play while she naps! Shh. Don't tell. Beautiful graphics,unique and educational plus it has very soothing music.  Such a treat.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Thought the movie was entertaining, however, i didn't expect the book somehow touched my heart...what a surprise..will go read the next two
B008602KQI|4.0|I have not watched this movie since its premier. I decided to watch it, since I heard that the second part will be available (not sure how soon).  I liked the job of actors and actresses, I think they got into their characters and were able to transmit much of the plot. I cannot say that I love it, because the killings between kids. I do not believe that this is the kind of example we want to send out to our children on this time where we see so much pain in real life.  So, if you are an adult and enjoy this type of movies, go for it.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|He can't stop talking about how educated & clever he is, which he seems to think is more important than his experience in the afterlife.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far the best of the three books where every thing gets answered and wrapped up. More than sex a story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is unreal it lets u go in the air an d fly.only if u guys would put a tournament to see who is the best in the world
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More story than book one but of course I couldn't put it down. The sex just gets repeatative if that can happen.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|I bought this CD primarily for the Somewhere over the rainbow song (best version ever) and have enjoyed the whole CD.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Wow. Tesla was a man on a mission. Good to see someone more consumed with changing the world than of making his name famous. Not a common trait among our morally corrupt society today.
B003CBTVNG|2.0|maybe I just was not in the mood.  found the movie tiresome and I shut it off.  maybe will try again some day.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|`enjoyed the concept and videography to accomplish the visual effects. I think being made to comment on movies is a infringement on my personal time.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I think it is one of the best cd's he has made. His overall sound has developed from in the beginning of his carreer. I do love to hear the old songs (Nat King Cole, Cole Porter, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett and of course old blue eyes himself ...himself Frank Sinatra). I have been a fan of michael buble's since he began and was virtually an unknown around here. You will not be disappointed if you purchase...a beautiful voice, great background melodies and love songs...where can you go wrong?
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Awesome app for people that need white noise to sleep. There are a ton of different sounds (train, birds, owls, music, different types of rain, etc). The best part about the app is that you can pick different sounds to play at the same time and set the volume of each sound individually. That way you never have the problem of wanting to fall asleep to a rain storm with birds chirping but not being able to sleep because it sounds like the bird is perched on your headboard.
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|I was unaware of Hellboy until I stumbled across it one day on TV.  No idea what it was, but it was amusing and full of action and moved right along.  Somehow the concept appealed.  It works very well on the surface as action/comedy, and the filmmakers don't lean too heavily on the underlying messages.  I enjoy the characters.  They are well-conceived and well-played.  A very satisfying film for an afternoon with some popcorn nice.  Good mental bubblegum.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was hilarious; I was able to relate to it on many levels. Going into the reading, I knew I had to read it because everyone else was recommending it, but I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. Was sorry to get to the last page. Highly recommended.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I had this app for awhile &its nice.Only thing i wish it had was video call so u can chat
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is pretty cool. If you're going to complete it in a timely fashion it helps to buy a few gems but it's worth it. Way addicting.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great game with awesome Graphics.This games worth playing for what you are paying for on the Kindle fire hd or tablets.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great addition works better than expected.I use it all the time home and travel. Works even with cover closed. recommend
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this game does. I like playing the Las Vegas method of scoring since it is cumulative.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Sometimes, a movie is not just one of the greatest of its genre but a great movie period...Unforgiven is one of those times. The true definition of timeless, classic masterpiece.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Mark Twain one said something to the effect of \\"I was going to write you a short letter but I did not take the time so I wrote you a long one instead.\\"Sean Patrick took the time to make this a short book and I appreciate it how valuable every word was. This may be the best book I've read all year, and I believe it should be required reading for every student in America.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I love angry birds so this just became another favorite. You must play if you like angry birds.  Play it..
B003MC5N28|3.0|This book was just ok to me. It took too long to discover what &#34;Release&#34; really meant. I also didn't care too much for the ending of the book. I also think this book is more suited for high school or adults, and not middle school.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I hardly ever take the time to write a review, however with this book I just had to. I loved everything about this book, from the first chapter to the last. I think the best part was that it was in the males characters pov. Emma Chase did an amazing job with this book, if I didn't know any better I would have guessed a male wrote it. I was laughing throughout the whole story. Been looking for a book that I would like as much as I loved Wallbanger, and this was it!!!!!!!!!! A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Movie not as expected. Tried to import current action with old fable - didn't work. Acting was mediocre at best.
B009R659L8|1.0|I am a big Mary  Higgins Clark fan and I have read all her books.  I usually can't wait to get back to the book.  This one is boring and slow.  It does not hold my interest like they usually do.  I am disappointed  in this book.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Laura Mvula's voice carries a crisp rawness that moves the spirit. Each song on this record is a gift to the culture of music.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Easy directions and fun to play.  Playing games is one way I like to relax and this game is fun & challenging.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in a great love story. The complete saga never disappoints you and the characters are great.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Initially this book was particularly unremarkable as a zombie apocalypse novel after reading The Remaining series and No Easy Hope trilogy. I found myself drawing comparisons in the authors ability to capture the impact on mankind for such a global tragedy and it was there that wwz triumphed. It is compelling and unique and measures loss on an emotional level without becomes self absorbed in zombie disposal.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Many common sense thoughts and analysis.  But you will still have some ah ha moments.  Easy to read with a lot of great stories.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it and it works very well.  The only thing is there seems to be a hestitation before it starts.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|A great movie which is now in my top ten.<br /><br />But, I will warn you now:  if you have absolutely no sense of whimsy left inside you, then this movie is not for you.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book and could not put it down.  I could see a sequel coming.  Hope there is.  Reminds me of GONE WITH THE WIND.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love this book and Morgan Rice is really good writer and cant wait to read more of her books sooner
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is hard to put down. My 7 yr old loves it. Does anyone know why my iPhone version updated to Miami and his kindle version didn't? He's really disappointed about it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is totally awesome,very responsive accurate and challenging on every level,weapons and armour spot on like the movie. requires some skill to get thru difficult levels
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great fun, but look out it will keep you comming back for more. It has new rooms opening up all the time & they reward you for accomplishments.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Greatest game I have played on kindle. It's free and there is so much to do. Yo can even walk away from the game and it continues to build for you
B00BT8Y774|5.0|I FREAKING LOVED THIS MOVIE!! This movie had me laughing the duration of the movie. It's pretty epic as well. The cool things they do and the Easter Bunny cracks me up! I recommend this movie to anyone!
B000IMKDPC|5.0|Not a huge movie watcher.....decided to watch it with the kids and was surprised I liked it so much. Would definitely watch it again
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Loved this film and wanted it for my &#34;grandchildren&#34; collection!  Color is so vivid and the story is very touching.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in this. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all be so honest with each other and skip to the end? I agree that the movie dragged at times but the story was good and the characters excellent. Great Philly backdrop.
0452270073|4.0|If you are looking for a stong entry in the war novel genre, that really gets to what it means to be in battle, this isn't it.<br /><br />Which was just fine with me. I like great writing that really gets into a character's head in a new and effective way, and I thought Regeneration was just that book.  I have a thing for the pretentious white Brit authors, though, so it could just be me.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I have never read Wuthering Heights but I might get to it someday soon. My Mother told me about it as she has read it .
0061134007|4.0|More exciting than Mankell, but not as over the top as Larsson, Jo Nesbo holds a solid place in the down-and-out detective genre.  So far America has been treated to two \\"faux trilogies\\" from Nesbo.l  Redbrest, Nemesis, and Devil's Star-- and Snowman, Leopard, and Phantom.  In my opinion, the first three read more like detective novels, and the 2nd three more like thrillers.  Whatever your preference, Nesbo takes time and attention to detail to make sure the plots hang together and that all the clues you needed were there.<br /><br />If Mankell is just a little to stale for you, give these a try, and Redbrest is a good place to start.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|this game is fun and interesting. I think others would like to play it too. It is a fast pace game
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game is a fast paced side-scrolling platforming constant running arcade style beat 'em up.  You run, you punch, you uppercut.  Of course there are upgrades which can be bought by earning in-games coins and unless you're really lazy or impatient, you'll never spend a dime in real cash other than the initial purchase.  The game isn't very hard and is a lot of fun, a great time-killer.  You can customize your character to an extent by changing hair, skin, and armour color, and even unlocking hats and masks.  The game is visually and auditorily pleasing with old school style.  Power-ups actually make a difference instead of doing little unnoticeable things like some games.  This game is worth the 99 cents or 99 Amazon coins.  And with all that said... FALCON PAAAAAUUUUNCH!!!!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I Am addicted to this game . I love it and would be thrilled if there were more levels to play
B0018BF1KY|5.0|Never heard of Rory until Joe Bonamassa played his Strat.Truly amazing  guitarist and stuck to his values by not cutting a single.!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I loved my kindle and I got a tablet. It was nice to be able to read on the tablet and the kindle.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This app is a great way to let your children express their feelings. So I think everyone should give it a five or four star rating .
B004K58GSO|5.0|Absolutely loved it!! Am a huge fan of classics, westerns and musicals. Also a huge \\"Duke\\" fan. Amazon has a nice selection of both.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I don't know what I would do without this app. My step dad just purchased a Kindle fire and my parents wanted to watch movies on it. So I downloaded some movies but Kindle wouldn't play any movies not downloaded b by them. This is when I found this app. It just played almost exerting I throw at it. It can play at any frame rate. Plus it's easy to understand. It's worth 5 stars because it's definitely a must have!
B00CW665VI|5.0|The storyline is like Pride & Prejudice from Mr Darcy' s POV. He is hot for her, but she is resistant. Drew is an ass, but you come to love him. I immediately saw it as a funny movie romance with my current crush Bradley Cooper as Drew and Jessica Chastain as the object of his affection.<br /><br />The pace is fast, I'm already quoting some wise cracks to my friends, laughing out loud at the 'illustrations' and want Sally Field as the NILF. I join the other fans of the book in praising it as an outstanding first time effort.
B002VECM72|5.0|If yuo haven't seen this movie, it is a real family event to see.  I first saw it when my sister-in-law came and bought it for us to watch.  She was RIGHT!  I bought my own copy.  Get it and watch it!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I guess I was expecting a bit more from the book. It seemed like the TV program.... used to be more interesting.
B00C8SBNMG|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this album.  The songs are top notch and I haven't stopped listening since it came out.  All the songs are well written and the performances are even better.<br /><br />On first listen I thought it was way too bass heavy, but the more I listened, the more I ended up loving the mix.  Even with the huge bottom end, everyone still has their own sonic space.  The drum sound is very Bonham-esque.  I'd have to say this is one of the top rock albums released this year...and that counts for the rest of 2013.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|My 2 yearl old boy and my 6 years old girl love this movie!!!! . If you are looking for a great family movie night ill recomend this one
B00005ONMJ|5.0|If it were not for the 1953 Salzburg performance, this would reign as the supreme Don Giovanni. Furtwaengler knows how to balance gravity and lightness perfectly, so the result is a reading that is both mercurial when it needs be, but never losing the frightening and tragic undertone of the Don's final demise at the hands of his late victim, the Commendatore. Where the 1953 scores is (a) Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's Elvira, FAR more intense than the frankly disappointing Della Casa, Rafaele Arie's towering Commendatore, a COMPLETE Oveture (no one seems to notice that the recapitulation is cut in the video) and the aria Dalla sus Pace, also missing from the video. A superb SACD hybrid of the 1953 is put out by the Societe Wilhelm Furtwaengler (the French Furtwaengler Society, only available to members). Otherwise, Siepi remains the definitive Don, Edelmann is terrific as Leporello, Gruemmer, Dermota, Berger and Berry are better in their respective roles than anyone else. As for Furtwaengler, well, I feel that he outclasses everyone else in this work; and although I acknowledge his greatness in Wagnerian Operas, his Don Giovanni, like his Fidelio, remains his supreme achievement in opera. For all the freedom he employs in his music making, his architectural firmness makes me wonder if he is more classicist than romanticist. Can any musician compare to him?
1582701709|5.0|This book is very informational.  I love the layout of the book.  It's very easy to read.  The message is very powerful.
0374214913|5.0|I can just imagine a group of nerdy, but hip guys sitting around, drinking beer, and solving all of the world's problems.  During the course of the conversation, they lament that no one has ever truly written a book designed to appeal to fantasy-reading, dungeons & dragons playing media techno-geeks who have a deep appreciation for cheesy 80's movies.  Clearly, one of those guys thought the idea still sounded good after the buzz wore off and decided to go for it.  That book is called Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.  How do I know that it probably went down like that?  We sense our own kind (excepting the \\"guy\\" part).<br /><br />I love this book!  While I found a lot of geek culture references to be highly amusing, I can see where the mass market audience might not get the humor. Also, the abundance of high tech references will date this work quickly.  I don't care, I still love it.  In fact, the potential lack of appeal to the masses may make me like it even more - they DID buy into Twilight, 'nuff said.<br /><br />The main character, Clay, is so nerdy, but lovable.  I absolutely love the way that as he pulls his friends into the mysteries of Mr. Penumbra's shop, he thinks of them in terms of D&D roles.  I sympathize with his struggle to find his place as an adult.  It is like the bookstore provides a safe refuge from the fickle and chaotic storm of corporate America in down-size mode.<br /><br />The excitement of Clay's merry little band of misfits is palpable as they try to solve the Penumbra's puzzle.  There are no explosions or assassination attempts, and yet this book is chock full of adventure, albeit a dorky one.<br /><br />Whether you are a hard-core geek, or geek-light, I recommend you read this sooner rather than later to get the most bang out of the pop culture buck.  What are you waiting for?  Go get it.  Shoo!
B009GEYX5E|2.0|Two main problems here: 1) photos take 30 minutes to develop and 2) the colors aren't good.  They look very warm and yellowish, similar to a filter you might have on a photo app, but definitely not what I like or enjoy.  Was hoping for better, some may enjoy, but this is not for everyone.  Given the expensive price I have to say I was disappointed in the product.
193700788X|3.0|This is actually a 3.5 star rating<br /><br />Reading this book was a bit bittersweet. Yay, a new Sookie Stackhouse novel! However, it is the LAST Sookie Stackhouse novel. Sniff. I have so enjoyed this series, and yet I respect that Charlaine Harris has decided to bring it to a conclusion rather than letting it grow stale as long-running series are wont to do.<br /><br />As typical, Sookie has found herself knee deep in trouble. The main difference is that rather than getting pulled into other people's drama, Sookie herself is the target of the trouble. As danger and intrigue swirls around her, Sookie tries her best to get through the trials of her life and relationships. By making Sookie the focus of the plot, Ms. Harris reminds us of why we love this character so much. Sookie is brave, loyal, and full of heart making a deep impression on those around her. That impression is not always good, hence the danger to Miss Stackhouse in Dead Ever After.<br /><br />The really cool thing about Dead Ever After that the author weaves many of Sookieverse players into the plot. Again, this relates back to those lasting impressions. Some of these characters are out to get Sookie, but many make an appearance to lend their support. This was especially touching during the scene where to courtroom is full of people who came to lend support to Sookie. The inclusion of so many characters from past books gives the reader an opportunity for closure. There are times when this seems a bit forced, like when Quinn comes by to help only to leave almost immediately leaving, but most of the appearances play out well.<br /><br />Dead Ever After is an overall fun read for anyone who enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series. However, I do not care for how Ms. Harris decided to resolve one major subplot; that of Sookie's romantic interest(s). I am not going to go into detail. Duh! You are just going to have to read it and find out what happens for yourself. This is an area in which I have long struggled, as Sookie's romantic decisions have throughout the series have been fraught with inconsistencies. I guess it is fitting that I would feel the same way about the final installment of Sookie's saga.<br /><br />As for the cover, I have never been a fan of this series' cover art. It has always seemed a little cheesy to me. I didn't really like this cover any better. It just seemed too gaudy. I did, however, appreciate the artwork inside the cover. I am still not a fan of the style, but I thought that it tied in nicely to story.<br /><br />Farewell Sookie Stackhouse. It's been fun. I will miss you.<br /><br />*NOTE:  Originally published on Silk Screen Views book review blog.ed, as Sookie's romantic decisions have throughout the series have been fraught with inconsistencies.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|It was important for me to read all 3 books in order. It gives a much clearer picture of the sequence of events. This was a book club selection and it was very well received. 6 of the 8 members gave it 4-5 stars!! Very good for our club. Archer is a very good author as he is discriptive and does not bore you at all. He keeps you wanting  more. I had a hard time putting it down. It's that good.  All 3 are great!

B0091REZMW|5.0|enjoyed playing just to pass time. would recommend it.the objects that you search for is repeatative but it is the tasks that you have to complete.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first.... love the story behind all the sinfulness and heat.  Can not wait to read what happens next!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginning of the book was a little slow for me. After the story picked up I couldn't put it down. I couldn't predict what would happen next. A must read!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|In the true tradition of Jeffrey Archer, the book was great.  I thought it was a trilogy, but it turns out I will have to wait until the next book.  This book kept you hanging and wanting more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It is my favorite game ever and it is so much fun! This is without a doubt the best game ever made and it is totally worth the wait.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It keep me very engrossed, so much so that I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next book.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Other than the fact that they let you play two rounds before they want a review the game is fun...your basic match three or more jewels for points and bonuses...easy enough and time consuming addictive
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very cool.  But I'll warn you: once you start you can't stop playing. It's a really cool game- fun,  too. Just be careful about how much and how often you play it. It does cost money but it is. worth it. If you want redstone,  horses,  fireworks,  brewing,  and a hole list of other things: don't buy pocket edition. Buy it on your computer. That's the full version of minecraft. But if your looking for a small version of minecraft,  buy this. You probably can't bring your computer on the road and if your looking for something like that,  get this. It's cheaper than the full version. ( full version is $26.99.) So I love this app and bet you will,  too!!! Buy this app.
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|Extremely happy overall. The color is as bright as the pics and the case goes on easy while never caming off on its own. Coupled with a screen protector, it provides full body protection.<br /><br />Only issue is that the holes for the lightning and stereo ports are kind of small. Apple and Apple-based products work fine but the Amazon lightning cable and one of my existing third party stereo cables were too big to fit.
1451627297|5.0|A long book but well worth every page...the intertwining of the story and the event on 11-22-63 are very well done
B0086900TI|5.0|The more \\"connected\\" we get the more detached we become. In a process that began in the television age, when we no longer had to look one another in the eye, (the flickering screen had us all hypnotized); and that continues with the proliferation of computers, we have all learned to externalize what we see around us. We no longer have to face our antagonists. We sublimate reality and replace it with online \\"friends\\" who pretend to share like interests, while denigrating \\"others\\" who don't fit into our cubbyhole-of-choice.<br />Societal ills have been downgraded from being major concerns to petty annoyances, (as long as the police keep \\"them\\" down in the \\"bad\\" areas, and keep the jails full). Poverty and hopelessness are on the rise and manufacturing has left town. The middle class is gone. And then we expect to sell the education bill-of-goods. We try to puff up our youth with ambition and competitiveness. We tell them that the schoolroom is the path to success, despite the reality of everyday life.<br />In this film executive producer and actor Adrien Brody, (and a great cast), portray teachers and administrators in an inner-city school. The excrement has hit the fan. Mandatory testing has arrived and the principal, (played by Marcia Gay Harden), has her job on the line. So not only do teachers have to play classroom cop to belligerent and violent students, they have to find time to motivate them to pass an exam. What is unspoken here, (and what really happens, particularly in New York City), is the imminent threat of a school shutdown. (I can never understand what Mayor Bloomberg thinks he has accomplished, aside from screwing with the teacher's union, with the abandonment of educational institutions. We should be fixing the system, not dismantling it.)<br />Henry Barthes, (Brody's character), has learned to put up a psychological wall between himself and the chaos. He only accepts temporary assignments. He is unmarried, relationship free, and living lean. However, despite efforts to remain uninvolved, (in an emotional sense), he feels their pain. He finds himself caring about a street woman. One of his students; (an outcast because of her weight), latches onto his every word; and reaches out to Mr. Barthes for help. What is a guy to do? The answer is in the film. It will drag you in too.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This final chapter to The Wheel of Time was everything it needed to be.  The battles were glorious and the ending appropriate.  I loved it and would have liked more.  But that would not be \\"appropriate\\".
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I love musicals. West Side Story is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is my opinion, like it or not, that Opera reaches too far. Musicals say ordinary language to move the plot and contain great songs. Operas, seem to have a few great songs surrounded by less than good \\"musical talking\\" and I can't stand that. Telling me you are going out the door and the other person saying goodbye all with badly written music which is never really good nor memorable. That being said this is a very, very good movie ....if you like Opera.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Just wish it had been longer and there were more to come. It was a good read and I will miss everyone, but I guess all good things have to come to an end.
B005LAIHCM|4.0|This movie is very good on the story level and the actors not bad but Jennifer Lawrence, aside from having a beautiful classic movie face, shows the acting skills that is getting her so much attention. Talking about the movie would only give away plot twists so just put on the popcorn and sit back and enjoy a good thriller.

0307352153|5.0|Thank you Susan Cain for writing this remarkable book.  I have tears rolling down my cheeks right now because of how moved I am by this extraordinary book. I am an introvert and finally realize that I'm \\"normal\\" and it's okay to be true to myself. For years I've wondered if there is something wrong with me because I've wanted to spend an insane amount of hours alone.  The minute I come home from work, I want to curl up on the couch and read a book.  My husband has been worried I don't love him enough because of the amount of time I like to do things on my own but after reading this book that has been so well researched I feel so relieved!!!!!  I've shared some of the research and information with my husband and I think he now understands that my need to be in quiet spaces and to be left alone sometimes is necessary for me like breathing.  I would love for everyone to read this amazing book!  I feel like I want scream (quietly) that it's okay to be an introvert. It's okay to not want to go to big parties, or group events or socialize all the time. I\\"m also an elementary school teacher and often hear other teachers complain about their quiet students needing to talk more or work better in groups or \\"come out of their shell\\".  While I think it's important to teach our students good communication skills,  I think we need to stop pressuring our students and ourselves that being an extrovert is the ideal way to be!  I learned so much from reading this book and highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are an introvert, or perhaps you are married to one and want to understand them better. Or, if you are a parent who suspects your child is an introvert, PLEASE READ this outstanding book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While this book was awesome......I still have to say this....WHY AUGUSTUS?????  I myself just read. This book over since it was that amazing but still...WHY?!
0547848412|5.0|Took a bit to get into it, but a wonderful story. Anxious to see how they're translate this story onto the screen. I expect it will be difficult to surpass the book.
0689835604|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who was just a little over 1 at the time. She was able to learn her body parts by pointing after she would lift the flap in the book.  It was so neat to see. Now at age 2 she'll still grab this book off the shelf and want to point out body parts of her dolls, our dogs, and even us!  I recommend this book for any young toddler ages 1-2!  It's perfect!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a really great game but I hate the fact the fact that you have to use the spin tokens when you get some.why can't we save them so we can spin later on?

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Big fan of the previous game-quell reflect-and have been holding my breath waiting for this one. It's SO worth the wait. They've really done a great job here adding new features and new objectives, while keeping that laid-back, relaxing feel.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This may be the best season ever,  I don't see how they will ever top this one. Tense and beautiful, and too captivating to look away. Gotta watch this.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I have a HD home theater sound system but somehow I cannot adjust the sound like all of my blu ray movies. This blu ray has has a loud distorted noise when I turned it up. So I just watched it without the sound system which mean I don't get the 100% blu ray experience. Disappointed.

125000098X|4.0|The end of it drove me nuts.  I hate to have a cliff hanger with no possibility of getting another 'chapter' for about a year.  I am an older reader and I can't remember details for a year - so I have to start it all over and read them all again.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|This game is very fun but still needs tweaking. The tutorial was very easy and simple but should give you a target to practice shooting at. There needs to be a better way to lock on to your opponent. Controls need a bit of tweaking. I found myself trying to bring my altitude up by starting at the bottom which actually drops you altitude. I also think that the controls should look more like a R/C controller but that's just what I think. This game is great for kids and even adults who are into R/C helicopters and/or combat. If you are looking for a fun and interesting game, I would suggest this game.

0525478817|4.0|- MAJOR SPOILERS -<br /><br />If I could, I would give this book about 3.5 stars. I guess my problem was that my expectations were through the roof, and to a good extent, it did fullfil them. It's definitely a page turner, as I finished it in pretty much two sittings, but I did have some minor issues that made it so the book didn't WOW me.<br /><br />First of all and most importantly, these are teenage KIDS. The way they spoke was, in some instances, well above how I've ever spoken to someone (I'm 25). I get it that Augustus and Hazel are real sophisticated and philosophical, but this level of dialogue is far from realistic.<br /><br />And, in relation to that, I felt like they handled the entire situation a little too well. Sure, they're used to dealing with hospitals, cancer situations, etc.. but at such a young age, you would think these two wouldn't be as emotionally ready for these situations. But, as a person that has never gone through cancer, I suppose I can't really speak on how to deal with death. Green did a good job expressing how much of a draining process their lives were... But why did they completely skip over Hazel's speech at Gus' funeral?<br /><br />With that said, I really did enjoy this book and would recommend it to friends. I really liked the parents in the story, and felt that the way they responded to Hazel was very genuine. I loved the ending that Hazel's mom got, and I loved how much Hazel cared about what their parents would turn into.<br /><br />The best scenes in the book were still the ones with Van Houten, and his character was perfectly written. (Hilarious!) The Amsterdam scenes in general were probably my favorites, and the trip up the stairs at the Anne Frank museum was a little tense for me, thinking Hazel's lungs were going to collapse at any moment (which was pretty much in the back of my mind for all 313 pages).<br /><br />The ending was very touching, and Hazel's fate was somewhat of a nod to An Imperial Affliction's ending, but like the story suggests, we already knew what was going to happen to her, and I'm glad it was done the way it was, otherwise it would've bordered on emotional overkill (no pun intended).<br /><br />Overall, very emotional book, with two slightly unrealistic children speaking like 30 year old Harvard grads. Still, setting that aside, I loved Hazel, and I loved her personality.<br /><br />Also, on a completely random note, does anyone that watches Bates Motel think that Emma is based on Hazel. I immediately made the connection physically and characteristically and pictured Emma throughout the entire story.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great read! Found myself laughing out loud many times. This book shows that Tina is not just an SNL legend, but a person who is not so different than all of us.

030758836X|2.0|With all the excitement and hype surrounding this book, I was extremely excited to add this novel to my summer reading list.(In fact, I bumped it up to the top of my list shortly after I purchased it...)  However, I just finished the final page and found myself completely underwhelmed and slightly irritated. It is obvious to me that Gillian Flynn shows amazing promise as an author, so I am simply in awe that she attached her name to this book.  The characters were unrealistic and at times down right annoying and she took what was a lively and enthralling plot line and slaughtered it with a horrendous ending.  I gave it 2 stars because I like her writing style, but she definitely lost her way in this novel....
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Actually saw movie in theatre, wanted my sister-in-law to see it. I will rewatch it again. I thought it was an excellent movie.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|It was not the best I've seen, but enjoyable enough.  The premiss of the film film was hard to swallow but in the view of some a posible senario for the future.  Some scenes were hard to follow and the ending was very anti-climatic.  Don't think i would watch this one more than once..
B00CW665VI|4.0|I really did like this book--is it 5 stars--not really, but it was good.  I didn't fall in love with the characters, although I did really like them.  You do laugh a lot in this one and the scenes are steamy as well.  Overall I would suggest this one to a friend, I just didn't rave about it enough to do 5 stars, but then I rarely give those out.  Super quick read.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It's extremely fun, and the make-up and dresses are pretty except that almost everything on there cost money. 4stars only
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book. Sparks had a way of keeping your attention and setting the details far enough apart that you can't put it down. As always, another 5 stars.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Game is super awesome  you must get It i have no idea why people are saying it is really one dollar it's free
145211207X|5.0|Another great &#34;Art of…&#34; book. Always inspired by these books. So many great character designs, new locations, Pixar is synonymous with creativity.
B003K16P3M|2.0|I thought this book was very creative, in the beginning. I thought this book had amazing action and adventure, in the beginning. I loved the characters of this book, in the beginning. I loved this book!............. in the beginning. Catching my drift here? When I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I found the characters interesting, the plot intriguing, and I couldn't wait to keep reading. However about halfway through something happened. Actually, quite the opposite happened..... NOTHING. And nothing kept happening until the end of the book. I was so hopelessly bored I found myself reading just to finish it already. This book could've been so much more, but it just fell so flat.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love youtube vevo it*$ da best muzik..video$ to play nd watch...not 2 mention is the 2013 updatest s*it around..inn.and @ kalifa$
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Takes awhile to get coins built up. The graphics and storyline are decent. I will sit and play for hours on end. If you are looking for time to kill you can check on your base and then switch over to a Netflix or Prime for a quick episode
B009NY43NY|1.0|The title basically sums it up. I was hoping for a good ending to the series... I was very disappointed, what a shame.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|this movie is a mother's dream come true and a son's also!  i recommend it to all mothers as a mothers day celebration by movie!<br />Pam  thanks Amazon
B002NN5F7A|5.0|As a former salesman, Alec Baldwin's motivational tirade really brought back memories.  And he nailed it. Though brief, definitely one of his best roles ever.  Even if the rest of the movie weren't great, that alone would make the movie worth seeing.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|is the most loveable movie of all...  boys best friend i call it!  a boy brings back his dog from the dead and the whole town helps to save his life again after he saves a young girl and his master from a fire in a windmill!  great!  thanks Amazon love Pam
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm glad that I saw the movie before reading this book, because I really enjoyed the movie. If I had read the book first, I know that l wouldn't have liked the movie half as much, in spite of the great acting. This is one of those stories I couldn't stop reading once I started and enjoyed it as much as the movie, in its own way.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|i was touched by the warmth finally given to Ralph by all his associates in his game...  they overlooked his sensitive side of feeling loved or appreciated!  Once he got his medal, and helped a little girl in need who was locked out of her game adventures of being a terrific driver on the tracks with her own created vehicle.  The best part was because he lost his medal this cute little girl made one to replace his out of a cookie with love written all over it!  It just touched my heart!  Big time!  love Pam
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I absolutely love my Marware MicroShell. I've had mine for over a year and my Kindle is in perfect condition, eventhough I take it everywhere with me. I love it so much I just bought another one, only to change colors:)
B009AMAGXK|5.0|i had no idea a movie could be made so well!  this young couple wanting to find love is being torn apart!  in the end they stay together and closer together thanks to her father giving up his life to save her daughters lover!  great!  thanks Amazon  Pam
0143122916|5.0|After hearing the author interviewed on WNYC, I felt compelled to read this book and I ordered it immediately. This man's story is riveting and informative. Just as studying the Holocaust, I believe this should be a must-read for students today.
098555780X|5.0|You can find lots of knot tying instructions on the authors Internet site but I like to have written instructions with pictures instead of watching a video. Great book!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|A must have! It is a sad chapter in history but respectably told in this movie<br />Get a tissue box and press play...
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|So far so good doesn't demand buying stuff with real money as much as others and there's allot to do besides collecting momentarily enjoyed but it is not loading and gameloft was of no help. happened with ice age another gameloft quits and they say you have to lose everything a nd start over frustrating..not HAPPY
B001A7X0XG|4.0|Say this movie years ago and have been looking to add it to my collection. Not a big one for Vamp movies, but this one really uses it without going over the top. Also the special effects are well done.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Way too many pop up ads and in-app purchase nonsense, tho' that may be my own peeve. My 5 yo loves to rescue the baby kitties, tho', and learned how to get around the ads and avoid the purchase links. I didn't think it was too bad, but got bored after 30-ish levels...there are a TON of levels with various challenges.
B00AEFXCLU|4.0|Great movie, have been looking to add this to my collection for some time. Loved it when I say it orginally and still do.
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|Very good movie.  If you read the book you may or may not like it as some things in the plot were changed and characters were combined.  Somethings just don't translate well onto the screen.  Overall, it does capture the essence of the book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you enjoyed Seasons One and Two, then Season Three of Downton Abbey is a must-buy purchase. I know you will enjoy the hours of great drama.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown knows how to get readers hooked on a story and keep the excitement coming chapter after chapter. I enjoyed this book and will read it again.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke was clearly a visionary for his time and it shows in how many classic themes of science fiction he covers in this book.<br /><br />I found that Childhood's End was a compelling read and very worth while but contained some problems in pace and character development. I feel that Clarke's influence in sci-fi has created a sense of diminishing returns since so many of his themes are now standard tropes and therefore lack the impact they once had.<br /><br />The story is told through many different people eyes over a significant period of time. This dynamic works well to tell the story but did present some challenges. I had some difficulty smoothly keeping track of the characters which was further hampered by the very small breaks in the Kindle format that indicate when a different prospective is presented, thus wasn't at all a major issue but I would occasionally have to look back to see when the break occurred. The characters presented were not on the whole very compelling beyond the basic archetypes they represented.<br /><br />Concerning plot, some oversimplification of basic human nature was assumed that I found jarring if necessary to move the story along. There were a few unexpected revelations that impressed me for how much they caught me off guard but the shifting themes throughout the book made it feel disjointed and uneven at times.<br /><br />Do not take these criticisms as a sign that I didn't enjoy Childhood's End but rather that I felt that it left some untapped potential on the editing desk. I loved the book and read it in the course of two evenings. If you love sci-fi and want to get a taste of it's roots then this is a great place to start.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I was not expecting anything when I watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not easy to please with this type of movie, but this one had enough twists and turns and unpredictability that kept me interested up until the end.  Matthew McConaughey was excellent, one of his best. I think we can assume that the dealings of the attorneys who work with some low lives was more realistic than we are used to seeing.  If not, the tricks this attorney used made the story more interesting.  Really liked this movie, and I'm usually more into relationship dramas.  Not much of that here, and it didn't need it.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The movies are great and must see. But, being on Blu-Ray doesn't add much. I wish these were the originals and not the enhanced special versions. Overall, it was a good purchase but I wouldn't pay more than $30.00 for it if you already have the DVDs.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I loved this app &lt;3. But then I wanted to go on one day and had to load the app again.I. had to do this a couple times but after it still let me on.But then one day I had to load the app again.I thought &quot; Oh it will load again like it always does. &quot; But when it was loading it said something like this &quot; Connection error. Can not download at this time. Try again later. I was like &quot; CRAP &quot;<br />I had to redownload the app and I lost the progress I had done.I would recommend this app.Just don't play it all the time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When this book was suggested to me, I didn't know if I really wanted to read it. It's a lifestyle I enjoy but have not venture out into it. I can be an Ana n I can be a Christian.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is soooo much better than the one that was already on my Kindle Fire. I just love this, it is so easy to use and quick and just another way to use my Kindle...
B002JVWR54|5.0|I loved this show. It's a shame it didn't last longer as it was really finding its groove with the second season.<br /><br />The first season dealt with the moral implications of the Dollhouse: does it boil down to the sex trade and human trafficking?<br /><br />The second season went deeper and tackled the question of what does it mean to be a person? Are personalities more than just bits of information or is there something more?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ended up getting the first Temple Run because I couldn't get Temple 2 to run the next day. So I am practicing on the original and hope to work up to Temple 2. I think this is probably a game for someone much younger than me but I am having so much fun with it, guess I'm addicted!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This will blow your mind and the sound effects are a some. I love it<br /><br />It is very realistic<br /><br />I
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This app is awesome it has more towers than btd4 it has special agents a monkey lab it has random missions special missions and two upgrade paths instead of one
B003L77FYS|5.0|Love it!  The season finale was awesome!  I watched it 3-4 times.  Defintely can't get enough of it...anxiously waiting for season 4 to arrive in the mail!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A good read. The characters were well written. Lots of suspense and there were times I had to keep my feet up off the floor!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love this series! The comaradarie between the characters is believable. The play between Castle and Beckett is worth watching again and again!  Have already watched the 3rd season and can't wait to get the 4th season!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Though this book was better then her last one....I still feel jiped. All that build up..she makes us fall in love with Eric and then she writes him away..and not even in a good way.  I like Sam..I guess I could get use too the idea of him and sook. But this was a S***y way to end this series. I'm left feeling extremely unsatisfied and a longing for a better ending to a series I truly adored
B0083WLKBA|1.0|After waiting almost a month to get the DVD's, the first disc was so scratched that we couldn't watch it.  That's $40 down the drain.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies. We have watched it multiple times and we get additional insights each time we watch it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It is wonderful I can change it to go with my mood. You can make some realy wonderful sounds if you experament
0738737909|5.0|I can say the most beautiful deck ever created. I'm in shock to see a 4ever star rating. Some people are so negative that they will try their best to find fault with even the most perfect thing. My readings with this deck is so accurate it scary. My clients all choose this deck when they come for a reading. They also found it to be the most accurate deck I have in my collection. I'm going to buy another one for personal readings.
1934030198|5.0|Anyone interested in increasing their fitness level and learning more about nutrition should own this book.<br />You don't have to be a triathlete to own and read this one, it's a beauty.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I bought one for each of my kids.  It is s great copy of the screwdriver seen on the show.  However, you have to install the button batteries yourself by removing a small screw underneath the button used to extend the screwdriver.  The button is just cap that is held in place by pressure. After repeated use the cap will become loose and fall off frequently leading to loosing it.  Once the cap is gone, the tiny screw holding the screwdriver together can loosen and be lost rendering the toy useless.  When this happened to one that I purchased, I glued the cap in place on the other one and on the next one I bought to replace the useless one.  This is a great toy that will last for the life of the batteries if you take the precautions I have described.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could hardly put it down! If you're looking for a great plot, characters you can love, and plenty of adventure, you'll find it in  Wool (Silo Saga). I'd love to read more about Silos 17 & 18!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I felt this was a great conclusion to a great series. It showed a perfect amount of sorrow and happiness. The author should consider continuing this series. It was a perfect catharsis. I enjoyed the book.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Nice sweet movie. Gives kids a different view of monsters in the closet. Easy to follow and not violent. Can watch over and over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This a great sequel to a great game. I like that you are allowed to play as different characters. The monster looks terrifying and it is very agile and persistent.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Originally I read this book to learn about Sheryl's perspective since I've been following her successful career for a few years now. What really struck me though is how applicable her lessons are to minorities trying to break into management. Her argument that one of the ways you break set mind sets and norms is to speak up and point out the problem. Basically one needs to raise their voice and refuse to be locked into their place by being passive simply because society says this is how it's always been. Simply put, this book has shifted my mindset.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game I like how they change things up on it for holidays and stuff it's really fun you will love it
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|By far one of their best albums.<br /><br />The music is awesome to listen to and the concert was great.<br /><br />Can't miss with this one.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This was just a great movie all around. Great actors, nice touch of humor, amazing effects and good, solid story. Nataie Portman was just great and Chris Hemsworth nailed it really well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will now read other books from this author. The book was very well written, and kept me hooked. You could empathize with the main characters, and there is plenty of action, romance and realistic conflict to keep the reader (me) turning pages.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Thought i'd like it but found it too gruesome and depressing. The effects were awesome and the acting solid, but just more darkness than I bargained for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app my little sister loves it.The graphics are really good.She loves to compete and take care of her horse.Its like having a real horse
1400064287|4.0|A nice little summary of why some ideas work and some don't, with a worthwhile analysis of both. A useful summary for business people.
B003405MF6|5.0|having grown up with Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton plus being a guitarist it is only natural both artists are to my liking.that being said.Beck's Emotion and commotion fairs pretty well on several cuts but does have tracks that could make one think ''what was he thinking'' but they are all good.just not as up to Jeff's par as it could be in my humble opinion.Somewhere over the rainbow is an outstanding tune that shows just how versatile Beck is along with some other cuts that do seem to miss a crescendo if one listens for details.only other issue might be jeff not do the album solo which far and away appeals to my liking,<br />thinking 'Live at Ronnie Scott's dvd which does wow you.as a life long fan this is a must have if you liked what he did with a day in the life on Scott's disc
B000083C49|5.0|Product was in great shape and arrived so quickly. I had it on VHS, but wanted it on DVD...I love purchasing used DVD's this way.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took about 25% of the way through the book before it picked up, and then it took off. Good read. Glad my Kindle gives me definitions because she likes big words, which fit with the characters. Overall, I enjoyed the read, but definitely different.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed \\"The Racketeer\\", as usual with Grisham novels.  Good summer afternoon on the beach reading.  Does not fail to entertain.
B0055ISACW|4.0|Am I wrong, or have the Amazonians hashed up the reviews here? Supposedly they have to do with the Muti-La Scala DVD of the Dialogues, but in fact they seem to be talking about the Opera du Rhin (Strasbourg) version. The latter seems to get 4-5 stars and perhaps La Scala does, though it's hard to to tell.<br />So while I would probably agree about the performances of this wonderful piece, I would give Amazon one star for messing up. (It's a little bit like a recent experience I had with Spotify, when clicking on what was allegedly a new recording of Beethoven's Kreutzer sonata brought up instead the last act of Don Giovanni).
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like dressing up tames and salon games so its fun to me you should try it out you self
B001BZGA8Y|3.0|returned mine, coz I do not like the very white band/face for man.  I figured silver face/band is what I want.
B000002PCS|4.0|Like most movie scores, this one has only one original tune (a second theme is imported from Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini). On this CD we hear that tune over and over and over, which is probably just what we Somewhere in Time fans want. It's as gorgeous to hear as Christopher Reeve was to look at, and for me the sadness of that lovely man's fate makes the movie, and this music, all the more poignant. I'd have given a fifth star for a little more variety; the entire score is rather slow and sad, and by the end you'll need to go out for a walk in the fresh air and remind yourself that life goes on. But for sheer romantic self-indulgence you can hardly beat it.
B0019M2ITY|5.0|it fits perfectly for young girls.  Just a bit cheap-looking with the plastic back.  But at this price $65 around, one has no regret.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have a really difficult time relaxing enough at night to fall asleep, but this has actually helped me. Love it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the glimpse into British life just before and during WWI. The Grantham family including the staff are quite loveable. I find myself not being able to wait to see what happens next.
B004TI5N38|4.0|True to form Baldacci. You get the adrenalin ride you are looking for although it did drag at times. The book could have probably been fifty pages shorter. But, all and all a good read.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It feels good to keep advancing through the levels. The chime sound is pleasant and the visual lights are pleasant<br /> as well. A relaxing time passer.
0765325950|5.0|I waited three years to read this book; I can't imagine having spent more than a half a lifetime as the first book came out in the late 80s. I was quite surprised by the ending, moved by the deaths of some of the characters, and reviled at the unbridled treachery and evil of some of the key villains (who are unrepentant to the end). I'm genuinely going to feel like something has been missing from my life as this is the last book of the series, but then it's all the more reason to look forward to Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series book #2.<br /><br />If you've never read this series, start from the beginning, or even consider listening to the audiobooks. What a wonderful series!
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you haven't listened to Linsdey Stirling, you have to give it a try. Especially if you like upbeat instrumentals. There are times this is the perfect type music that fits the mood. Wonderful CD!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I STARTED THIS GAME THINKING IT PROBABLY WOULDN't hold my attention.  Boy, was I wrong.  I was hooked from the moment I STARTED playing.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I always loved this movie and now so does my five-year old!! The movie is full of whimsy and leaves you wanting to dance and sing.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|A great movie for a lazy day.  Predictable plot and there is singing.  I enjoyed it very much.  I intended to watch it again hopefully real soon.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I've watched and loved many of Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies, but this one... I just didn't get it. The movie didn't seem to have any arc, and real purpose other than to provide a window in to the life of the main character and how he comes to meet and be involved with the 'Master', who is modeled after L. Ron Hubbard, and the cult he is in the process of building, set sometime in the late 50's.<br /><br />Both Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman give great performances. It's just that the movie lacks any real hook to keep the viewer engaged (apart from the performances, which while great, don't really engross the viewer for 2hr 17min). Many have said similar things about the PTA's 'There will be blood', but I found that movie held my interest more than this one did.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, Love, Love It! I'm totally addicted to this show! It will be one long summer as we wait for it's return!
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|I've been a fan of Wes Anderson's work since I saw Rushmore. It's still one of my favorite films. The Royal Tenenbaums is definitely a close second. When you watch a Wes Anderson movie, you can expect certain things. This movie is very much in those veins and if you like Wes Anderson, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. It's not my favorite Wes Anderson movie, but I'd rate it higher than Darjeeling Limited or The Life Aquatic.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Very happy with this product! It's a 'must-watch' every Christmas season! Never gets old or less humorous, and has a lot of heart found in most families.
B009APMNB0|5.0|Within 15 minutes of receiving this product, I had my monitor calibrated and ready to process photos or any graphics.  I use it for editing photos and graphics for web sites and it works perfectly.
1250027624|5.0|This is a very informative and beautiful book. I love seeing and reading about 'behind-the-scenes' activities. It's a book to read over and over, and view the photos from time to time.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|So intriguing and well written! This is one of my favorites I've watched in long time. Whoever made this show had me in mind :)
1250006341|5.0|Worth every penny if you're a 'Downton Abbey' fan! Type of book you can re-read, easy to pick up and put down, and photos are beautiful! Jessica Fellowes makes this book a great companion to the TV series!
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Billy Corgan orchestrates this masterpiece and the revisit to Siamese Dream lives beyond it's initial release in the mid 90's. All the bonus tracks, covers and demo outtakes make it a no-brainer buy. This collector's edition, for lack of a better phrase, is an essential listen for any enthusiastic Pumpkins fan. It also features great packaging and a bunch of extras that illuminate that beautiful time lamely dubbed 'grunge' when music still had a beating heart, albeit a dirty, clumsy and beautifully tattered one. Siamese Dream embodies that time and reminds me that music can't die but only fade to irrelevance speaking directly towards the present faux music. It's Miracle Whip and will never be 'Mayonnaise'....
B00005JKNF|4.0|This movie was very good, but not as good as Downton Abbey, which it spun from....but, nevertheless, good! I'm glad I ordered it and got to see it.
1476733953|5.0|Such a great book.  Moves quickly, character's that you want to learn about, and an entire world that sucks you and makes you understand the human condition even better than before you enter.
B003AWRMCE|4.0|This DVD was really ordered for my husband, but it is an excellent classic western movie that I enjoy, also. Amazon orders have never disappointed me.
B007704HO6|5.0|lovely [ is it true?] story and very good read, downloaded this for the kindle and then you can share it on the ipad with your family- that cant be bad can it?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Challenging yet fun game. Definitely worth having! Great variety of play, very rewarding as you race and great way of teaching how physics work.
B00881VLCE|1.0|cant rotate the pieces no matter how many times I tap the pieces. I. want my money back.  don't like. it. when I. get charged for junk.
B001KEHAI0|4.0|I love this movie and bought it as a gift for some one else who has enjoyed it too. No problems with the Blu-ray.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I love this. This is a 3 in 1 stylus and it works great on any tablet. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is when you want to swipe the tablet screen it does not respond so I have to use my figure. I own now 2 of these stylus. It is great to use. And for the price well worth it. Especially when you get a stylus that is 3 in 1.
B000MV90IU|4.0|I bought this as a gift for some one else. They said they liked it and did not have any problems with it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|When you think the author has finally exhausted his list of even the most peripheral characters, he mentions a hundred more. This series grabbed my attention with books one and two; however, I regret having spent the time and money on books three, four and five. When books six and seven are available to lend from the library, I will check them out and skim them to finally get some closure, and then be done with this seemingly never ending saga.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great re-read, preparing for the last book to come out. I'm about to re-read second book so I'll be ready and waiting for the third in two days.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very  much.  Jodie Foster did a great job, as always. I do wish it had a happier ending.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck has come a long way from being the wayward detective on a luxury estate in Hawaii.  His portrayal of Jesse Stone is spot on, with a touch or two of humor to lighten the storyline.  I would highly recommend this series to any and all.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|As always Jodie Foster was great in this movie. It kept me on the edge of the seat, as most of her movies do.
B00BVYQ8NW|5.0|Orphan Black is the kind of show I live for. Not since Breaking Bad has a show intrigued me so.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Slightly plasticy smell so wash 1st and the cup is a light weight aluminum cup so can be bent if not careful. Case is sound and textured bottle is nice.. Over all a great product!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is not the typical crime scene, complexity ridden book that takes notepads to try to remember all the characters and plot twists, but this book was hard to put down.  It was refreshing. The story is different than anything I have read in a while.  It talks about schizophrenics or mental illness or something, but it is humorous and sad at the same time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read what will happen next to Eva and Gideon!  I could not put the book down and I am on pins and needles waiting for the next book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this sory line. Itisust perfect since I just traveled to that area. Would suggest it to anyone (men or women).
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Glad this was an option...great work and really enjoyed it.  I used to make the shield all the time I was a kid.  Reaffirmed my love for the shield...
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Bad Content I did not want to watch this film. It is not a good film to watch at all. I messed up and clicked on this one and had a bear of a time getting out of the movie on my Ipod.

B0087XBUS8|3.0|The book is written well for the most part (written in semi- mediaeval dialect, still not that hard to follow), great characters, awesome places, fight scenes (some very gory), monsters of sorts and twists: the only thing about this book that might get you down is it doesn't really have a central plot line.<br /><br />It meanders from the perspective of each character every chapter, each character has their own portioned plot-line of their own problems; some intertwine with other characters, some clash, and some don't meet at all (which isn't a bad thing, just how it is). Because of that, most of the book sort of just stays at a steady pace and there isn't really a bell-curve plot wise until your more than halfway through the book, and even then, its sort of short lived because it changes chapters to the next character who's life and experiences aren't as pressing as the last characters; so any adrenaline rush you might experience quickly gets sniped out and you're left with a cliffhanger (which might be just how the book functions to capture its readers in each characters story).<br /><br />Somewhat spoilers:<br />A good portion of the book is politics (it is the 'game of thrones'), the other chapters mostly consist of characters who were born or given some kind of handicap in life and wish to prove themselves more than what they seem, a small portion is of female protagonists who defy their places as girls or women in society and prove themselves more than what they're seen as each chapter either through wit or brute strength (from many people I've spoken to, men and women alike, its the part of the book they seem to enjoy the most, not just because they're strong girls and women, but because the plot lines are actually enjoyable those chapters).<br /><br />All in all, if you're interested in science fiction, historical-fantasy, and Tolkien, this book is a fairly good read, you'll just have to be aware of the changes in each chapter and stick with it. Although, unlike Tolkien's series it contains way more violence, gore, sexual themes, misogyny (due to the medieval era, although sometimes I feel it's pushed too far) and crude language.like Tolkien's series it contains way more violence, gore, sexual themes, misogyny (due to the medieval era, although sometimes I feel it's pushed too far) and crude language.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Liked the story line. Too much sex though. Quite captivating. Men too should read it. Thank you E.L. More please
1451626088|5.0|Excellently written! A good history, and a good story overall. A new and different perspective, which makes it very interesting..
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good book. Reacher gets caught up in  kidnapping. Wrong place, wrong time. He finds himself helping an FBI agent, Holly Johnson fight a crazy militia leader with a crazier plan to become  president  of his own New World. The book is not in first-person, as th  first book. It is slow in some  areas. But overall, it's a good, fast-paced read.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|Had loading issues. Ended up spend money on another channel in order to watch...  Wish I had used other channel to begin with!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|just asking but can u play with other devices which have the full version or is it only kindle with kindle? Any way I love minecraft.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is the best game I had on my kindle so far.People who are reading all these reviews you should buy this app.  :)
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is one of the better books I have read in recent years. Although it is fiction, it is embedded in Soviet Russia (Stalin era) and it is written so well, you feel like you are inside that society, with it fears, the hunger, the structure of society. It is on the one side a murder(s) mystery, but that really under-represents it. It has historical, sociological value and is very intense. I kept thinking about the book even when I had to put it down and long after I finished reading it. You learn a lot and go away with having read a truly good story.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Package arrive quickly, well wrapped. We have enjoyed re-watching the series, it was especially nice to have revisited #2 Wrath of Khan as the new film Into Darkness references back to it a lot. Haven't finished the series yet but will over the summer.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It has so many choices to choose from, or you can pick one of their mixes or make your own and save it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the easiest predictive keyboard I've ever used. After it learned my speech patterns it barely takes any effort to write sentences with the limited screen real estate of a smartphone.
B002WPVNZM|4.0|Loved this stuff! I especially liked &#34;secrets&#34; and could literally listen to it all day and not get tired of it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is the story of a boy genius who doesn't fit in at home and his adventures as a pawn learning how to fight aliens to supposedly save the Earth from destruction. Although I am not usually a science fiction reader, this book really kept my attention. For a main character who generally doesn't make or keep relationships, Ender really reaches out to the reader.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|Diana Damrau is superb in this version of Verdi's Rigoletto.  Any true opera fan must have this version in their collection.
B008F9E306|3.0|This cd is avg to me and im kinda surprised with how high the rating is for this cd and how many people have rated it. If I had to guess its all probably because of a single ft lil wayne but a single dont make an album. This cd has a couple tracks that r bangin but alot of jus avg songs and nothin too mention. Reguardless T.I. is still king of the south and still the best outta Atlanta.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|It is certainly a different story line but very long and I had to keep reading to see how the author would finish the novel. It's quite clever how she put the novel together but it is a bit of an epic tale. For me its was a bit long and I found the characterst annoying and not very likeable. I concluded they deserved one another.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I've watched the other Bourne movies several times, but wasn't sure what to expect with this one. The action is definitely equal to the other Bourne flicks. I had difficulty figuring out how this storyline fit in with the other movies. I almost felt like I should have watched those three just prior to watching this one. I think the timeline overlaps the first two? However, I think this one gives us information about the hearings that wasn't in the previous movies. Understanding all of that wasn't entirely necessary to enjoyment of this film, but I like to have my details straight. The main character was believable. His desire to remain smart was touching and gave him good motivation. If anything, I'll probably watch the first Bourne movies and then watch this one again.
B00AG297GK|1.0|This was absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  What a waste of time and life.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is one of those movies that couldn't possibly be as good as the book no matter how hard they tried. I give 5 stars for the effort, the acting and the decisions that were made in creating this film (except for Peeta -- he is so different from my mental image of him!). What gets lost in the movie version is the characterizations of the combatants and the beauty team in the capitol, the relationships Katniss has with her father and mother, and the background information about the districts. Having said that, it's a good movie -- especially if you haven't read the books!
0743497465|3.0|Like most other Dan Brown books I've read, Deception Point kept me engaged with lots of action.  Robert Langdon books (Da Vinci Code, Inferno) are like scavenger hunts; this one was more like slowly trying to solve a puzzle.  \\"Here is a deception... how did they go about tricking all of us?\\" And they break it down one part at a time. It's not running around looking for clues that lead from one site to another, like the other books. It's a bunch of people trying to figure the deception out, while trying to stop some people in power from falling for the deception before it's too late ... while the perpetrators of the deception are hot on their trail, trying to terminate them before they can reveal the hoax.<br /><br />You honestly wanted to know whodunnit, and why.  I must admit, I figured out whodunnit rather easily, but even correctly guessing who was behind the deception didn't make it clear to me WHY they had done it, so I guess he did that part well.  Perhaps I have read too much mystery, but both in this and his new book Inferno, I guessed the bad guy before it was revealed, and I don't remember being able to do that so easily with earlier books.<br /><br />That said, it suffers the same problems as other Dan Brown books: too many factoids everywhere, like the author is trying to show how smart he is or how much he knows about everything, cliche romantic elements where the female begins to feel all attracted to the smart protective male, etc etc.  Dan Brown loves fabulous topics that he can list all sorts of factoids about, but as for developing characters and using truly rich writing, he is kinda weak there.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It's been a while since I read the book, but it seemed like the movie didn't leave anything major out. I thought the actors did a decent job. The aliens were a bit over-done, but probably to be expected. All in all, a decent movie.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I love this movie it was amazing all of the bad reviews don't listen to them I could watch this over and over again!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A wonderful, visually stunning adaption of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel of the same name.  Starring Richard Armitage, Daniela Denby-Ashe, and Sinead Cusack (among others), this production is a must-see for fans of period drama.<br /><br />Book synopsis via Wikipedia: &#34;Forced to leave her home in the tranquil rural south, Margaret Hale settles with her parents in the industrial town of Milton where she witnesses the harsh brutal world wrought by the industrial revolution and where employers and workers clash in the first organized strikes. Sympathetic to the poor whose courage and tenacity she admires and among whom she makes friends, she clashes with John Thornton, a cotton mill manufacturer who belongs to the nouveaux riches and whose contemptuous attitude to workers Margaret despises. The confrontation between her and Mr Thornton is reminiscent of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, but in the broad context of the harsh industrial North.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a good game. I love to play it. I play it almost everyday. A good game for kids to play also.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|I've been a fan since the early 80's and am so glad that, unlike many of their contemporaries, OMD have not lost their mojo!<br />This is classic OMD and yet sounds fresh as anything todays electronic artists can muster.<br /><br />OMD &#34;We Love You&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game is not what it seems. You can't buy fish, which it seems you can  from the pics. I actually give this 0 stars. Everything is expensive and when you get to about level 7  you almost have to buy extra pearls etc. With your own money. This would be a good game for 3 year olds not teens and adults.
0062238310|5.0|I found the book enjoyable.  It is fun to read the script since it is like reading a play.  It might not be for everyone but I liked it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is amazing, for all ages! When you're feeling bored, and can't sleep, just turn on your Kindle Fire, and get squakin'!
1250027624|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and found this book to be very informative about the characters and the background regarding the Great House.  I would highly recommend to any Downton Abbey fan.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The design is excellent, the stand works, nice and simple. What I love is the automatic shut off and turn on when opening. The Kindle's turn on button is really bad, I hate trying to find it.  I have other tablets I occasionally take out of the case when using.  With the Fire HD, never as I want to use the case to shut it down.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|If you are a fan of Dan Brown you don''t want to miss this one.  An exciting and historical tour of Washington DC.
B003730LRY|3.0|A fun movie, though a little too slow and pokey at times, though I would say it followed the original TV shows style pretty closely.
B00003CXRM|4.0|The movie is very entertaining.  The music is good and the story line is quite funny.  We like it a lot and will share it with friends.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|This is the classic Terminator.  Loved it when I first saw it, loved watching it again.  Would have given it a 5 star if had more extra features.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one of those rare books that is so powerful it will come to the forefront of you memory when someone asks, &#34;What are some of your favorite books?&#34; So creatively and relatable written that you won't be able to put it down. We think of Kim Jung Il as a laughable buffoon so much in our society that we forget the evils he imposes on his people. We also are so far removed from that culture that the people he imposes upon are not people anymore; this book make them real. This is simply a must-read.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I loved the Terminator series.  I enjoyed it in the theater, when I first saw it.  Can't go wrong with this series.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good read.  Well told stories;  some a little odd, especially the political views and results, but it is a story about Zombies.
B000002B5L|5.0|Great cd of The Fugees. No modern music collection is complete without The Fugees. One of the greatest groups of all-time.
B000002IQW|5.0|When Nirvana got big and forever dumbed down music and music quality where today anyone could be a poser, talentless, autotuned, depressing whinefest, nickleback rock star there was also Skid Row and GNR who proved to the world and still do today that ROCK takes true talent, chrisma, and balls.  Slave To The Grind is a testament to great, relentless, uplifting yet at the same time bone crunching music both lyrically and musically.  One of the besr rock albums ever made to this day.  The fact that there is still a Motley Crue, Skid Row, Sebastion Bach Twisted Sister, Megadeth. Metallica, Slayer etc etc going as strong as they ever did shows who truly won the war.  Metal/pure rock lost the initial popularity battle when grunge when grunge/rap went big but these days they were both just blips on the radar as neither is heard of much now.  Bands like PJ and Soundgarden wont talks about or even admit to grunge if they wear shorts on stage thats how dead that scene is, and rap is laughable garbage where it's scene leaders are now in J-LO and beyonce songs lol. Metal and pure rock is still as strong as ever, once the major labels die when their s*** out turd poser rock bands like nickleback and justin bieber continue to fail and dwindle, the quality talent required music with regin again, hopefully this time it's managed correctly to prevent another nirvana which if it did happen as this point....I mean if you dumbed down post grunge the whole song would be crying like a pussy with a one string guitar.  Hail this album and rock music \m/\m/
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A Wanted Man had the typical Lee Child action and intrigue, but I felt it was a bit too slow I parts.  I like the fact that Child doesn't encumber his books with too many actors.  This book was enjoyable but could have been 50 pages less and been jus as good.
B000002J3W|5.0|Great album by Skid Row, the first three are amazing afterward it's not Skid Row anymore literally.  From start to finish I can listen to this amazing disc over and over and never skip and song or get board of it, it's that well done.  Classic early 90's true rock, no depression, snotty whiney vocals or dumbed down guitars here. \m/\m/
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got to play for about thirty minutes then I left the game... when I came back, it would show the Imangi studios screen, then go to my home screen, every time... zero stars! (if possible)
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row are one of the best pure rock bands ever alongside Guns N Roses, they are not hair bands that talent labotomy bands like Nirvana claim to have killed.  If you put a crappy hair band, a crappy gayrunge band and Skid Row side by side there is no releation as both those horrid fad's are dead a Skid Row remains as valid today as they ever were due to the insane superior talent this band (in it's origional form)had.  This album is a testamnt to pure 80's rock N roll not hair crap.  The vocals, riffs, lyrics and pure ROCK on this album outshine any grunge depressionfest garbage or hair band garbage of the time.  Listen and find out don't just take your eddie vedder fanboy friends word that Skid Row was a hair band.  In those times and current times Guns N Roses and Skid Row/Bach destroy any Pearl Sham or Selloutgarden who now make radio friendly music with cornell making justin timberlake albums on the side resulting in a half assed SG reunion album.  The last two true ROCK bands to be formed were Skid Row and GNR.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. Fast paced and full of character. You will want to play it all day.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Great acting by both guys. But Hoffman's surpasses Cruise. The movie story is simple yet attractive. Overall a great movie thanks to the two actors!!
B004BSFC46|5.0|My grandson loves the colors and faces on these.  They are perfect for when little ones are just discovering their world.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Good plot (which saves the movie), acting is good, and photography so, so, but is entertaining. Cage's work is really superior.
B000IVW25M|5.0|This is such a wonderful film for all generations. The price was right on Amazon - combined with the shipping, it was a great deal.<br />Snow White is the perfect gift for your grandchildren.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The events in the final chapters seem to come out of nowhere & create a very awkward close to a series I really enjoyed.
B009L6UDUG|1.0|It doesn't play.  I haven't ordered anything more from Amazon since this as this is the second time I have purchased this movie and it didn't play
B0037EAJAC|4.0|In this era of wild action and explosions every 2 minutes, Ran might seem a staid relic of the past.<br />The deeper story is a classic of a bygone age. Invest the time and you will not be disappointed.
B009A87ZQU|1.0|It didn't play.  I haven't purchased any more items from Amazon since this order as this is the second time I purchased this movie and neither one played.  I'm finished wasting my money on buying DVD's from Amazon
B000ICL3CE|5.0|This band is one of my favorites of all time! My CD got to me quickly and in perfect condition AND for a fraction of the cost of a new one.
B00CW665VI|4.0|If you're one of those people who can't separate you're personal beliefs when you're reading (like listening to a male chauvinist pig) this book is not for you! It's a book...it's that simple don't take it personally! Now if you're someone who just likes to take a reality break and can find humor in a man being a pig (and let's face it they can be, just like we women can be something else not so nice ; ) then you will enjoy this book. The author had a unique and fun way of writing this book. Bravo! This one is defiantly worth the read!
B00C061I3K|5.0|My first listen through on this album had me skeptical. It wasn't what I expected from Daft Punk. The second time I listened to the entire album, I was surprised at how much depth there was to the music. They have created an incredible sound of the past from a near forgotten genre. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, in support of an artist that I have been a fan of for well over a decade.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I personally think this is a great romantic-drama. How a mentally affected person copes with his problem and tries to maintain a \\"normal\\" life after experienced a metal break down and then out of the sudden meets someone affected by the same demons. Someone that deep inside understands him and is also in great need of love. I think it is simply brilliant and well developed, the cast is amazing and as you can expect De Niro, Cooper and Lawrence  will totally make you feel part of their dysfunctional lives.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|another good thinking game along with color coordination and speed to see how well you can do this and be happy with your score
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|To me it's so scary that I can't even get through five minutes of it. I'm also a wimp. Anyone that wants a good scare, get this game. I'm so scared
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun to watch the expressions on the children's faces when the car is moving up and down and over again
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book was fine but after so many novels, I needed more closure.  The series shouldve ended sooner.  Glad I read it though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its great to see yourself challenge yourself with the colors and trails to see how fast you can go without getting stuck
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This reminds me of &#34;1984&#34; and &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; and &#34;Animal Farm,&#34; it is well-written and thought-provoking, although I don't feel it is quite to the caliber of the former titles.
B0052T7IC2|5.0|This work of artistic contribution from the Ramones is one of the most treasured in my collection of vinyl because of its applicability of punk rock and its musicality of heart and soul. This record is one of the most iconic pieces of history of its time and is further boosted by this through its nature of being &#34;real&#34;. The drums are perhaps my favorite part about this whole record because it is classic Ramones to be that part. Do you feel great and want to jump around when you hear &#34;Blitzkrieg Bop&#34;? Well, you should! Do you want to &#34;Beat on the Brat&#34; when you hear that ONE moment in the song that they're out of sync? I certainly do! Do you think &#34;Judy is a Punk&#34;? I haven't met Judy, but I think she is a punk! &#34;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&#34;? More like...wait...yes...yes I do. When there's a &#34;Chain Saw&#34; sound at the beginning makes you wanna be drilled into the song perhaps makes me go whoa!!!<br /><br />There's a lot to love here. This release was one of the first from the Ramones and I firmly believe it is one of the best out there. If you don't purchase this record, then your collection is not complete in the least. Save yourself the trouble and purchase this. It's worth it. Let's Dance!!! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Inventive, well thought out, action packed, and a little romance.  Let's hope mankind doesn't do this to themselves... But if they do, let's hope there is a Juliette there.
0141331461|5.0|Good service.  Purchased for my granddaughter.<br />She was very happy with it.  She is collecting the books and was satisfied with the book.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What's not to like?? Great interaction, excellent cast, lots of action, and who wouldn't love Helen Mirren with a machine gun??? Bring on Red 2!!!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I cannot decide it Penn overacted or was pretty much playing himself.  Either way, movie would've been better served with another person playing the villain.  Overall, was a decent mobster type flick.  Just seemed to lack anything original.  Great supporting cast.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|People &#34;assume&#34; that &#34;True Romance&#34; is strictly a love story. Most definetly not. This movie grabs you from the beginning, and doesn't stop till the end. Fantastic movie!!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This is Paul in his prime and proud of his best work with Wings- Band On The Run, Venus and Mars most noticeably.I watched this on Cable as a child, Saw it in limited release on the big Screen 2 weeks ago. Purchased the clean sounding remaster on May 28th and will be purchasing the Blu-Ray on June 11th. McCartney fans need this one.BUY IT AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!!!!!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The blu-ray came as promised, it was for my husbands birthday.  It arrived in more than enough time, perfect timing in fact.  He was so excited!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Anxious to read the next installment.  Loved the atmosphere of the area set by the author.s excellent word choices.  Impressed by the strength of the islanders and their lifestyles.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game, wonderful graphics. My only complaints are that there doesn't seem to be a zoom option, which is annoying because some of the objects are small and hard to see; and also that the buttons are a bit on the small side as well. As someone with big fingers, I can see this getting annoying eventualy.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Purchased set for my wife who is a fan. She really loves the set. Recommed the set for any fans.
B0097K21YW|5.0|Thanks to my husband, my almost 4 year old has an almost unhealthy obsession with Godzilla..so you can imagine my delight when this was the app of the day! The first few levels are fairly easy, then he got stumped for a SHORT while..now I couldn't even tell you how far he has been..this game is my rainy day babysitter, or my . Mommy needs to make dinner or heaven forbid take a shower, SAVIOR! I never would have paid 2 dollars for it, but now in hindsight, it's totally worth it haha..what child doesn't like monsters and blowing up little buildings..oh yea..best part..THIS GAME HAS NO ADS!!! I keep my kindle password protected so he can't buy anything, but ad games still bring up pop up screens he can't get rid of alone..i can let him play this with NO HASSLE!
B008QLXSG8|4.0|Cited as one of the top 100 books of all time in a list I read, this small book makes you conscious of what it means to have no feelings, no empathy, no compassion.  Particularly in today's world where so many people are disconnected through the use of impersonal electronic media it reminds the reader why interpersonal connections are so important.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love to play this game I actually am on it 24/7. I can't believe this game is this fun.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun game to play,my girlfriend can win these in under a minute takes me all day lol. Very fun
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is fun I play it all the time . I wish they would make the crossbreeds cheaper so I could make more
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can i say its a free easy to use calculator with some very cool themes. I recommend this one for asic calculations
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing. The only one word I can come up with to sum up this game.<br />The only thing I would change is if the versions would update sooner.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was action packed and my kids loved it. A must see if you like the Avengers!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read all the books and have been a big fan of the books.<br />Having said that, I was kinda of disappointed in this one.  It almost felt like it was filler to the last book not the last one.  Like the episode that airs before a season finale.  The big build-up.  The ending wasn't ambiguious or anything, but the big characters that built the series were almost left out of this one, i.e. Bill, Eric, Pam, Alcide etc.<br /><br />I'm glad that I finished the series, but I wasn't very happy how it ended.<br />At least we still have the TV show.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|can't wait for the next session.  there was a little excess added to the original script but what movie doesn't do that these days?
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Love this app, it's so fun! I love battling the big band! Taking care of an CITY is Great! The best part is that it's free!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Never read the book until now.  What as great book it is.  If you haven't already read it, you should.  We all know most of the story but until you read it you just don't know how good it really is.  Read this book,you won't regret it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|First I'm a big fan of Lee Child so have read all the books, then listened to all the audio books.  Like many, ok ALL Reacher fans I was bummed out that Cruise was playing the part.  But on the flip side I figured he would bring in many more people to see the franchise.  Was Cruise Jack Reacher,  no but I enjoyed the movie just because I like Tom Cruise and the story line was ok.  They didn't screw up the book too bad. I just pretended I was watching a Tom Cruise movie not a Lee Child inspired movie.<br /><br />I figure Cruise will make another one or two and then move on.  Hopefully the series will go on and they will pick a big guy.  Somebody on the body size of a James Arness, Clint Walker, Chuck Connors, old TV cowboy actors who got the job purely on their size and not previous acting skills (John Wayne size). I don't know of any BIG Size current movie stars so the only Big Guy I know is Blake Shelton.  Can he act? I think so.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Loved it then, Love it now and even better now that it's on blu ray disc. I would recommend these discs to any Star Wars fan and suggest you Google the million  plus review's that have been written about these features for last several decades. As if you didn’t already know.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Was sort of hard to get through all the medical terminology.  Other than that it was a good read.  It was interesting from a  medical viewpoint.
B00913DPW2|1.0|The hints you use are pointless. They take away from offered hints and offer no help<br />Love hidden object games but not this one
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read this over the Memorial holiday weekend and it was very much the page turner.  I really liked it.  I only hope book three is just as interesting.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book was okay, nothing great, wouldn't encourage me to read any more of the authors books. The ending was useless also.

B0010SKUYM|3.0|I really agree with another's reviewer named \\"reader reader\\" but I give this book 3 stars and not 1. Writing is well written and entertaining. The story starts out interesting. I was wondering why this guy was hiding out in an inn, I pondered and said to myself, hmmm...what his story? I wished I didnt ask myself that becuause the character starts out from where it all began at age 9. Ok, at age 9, are you really that important to start at this age. I said to myself this better be good. At first, I was a tad bit bothered becuase it sounded like someone who likes to talk about himself and you can careless about. This someone who was giving himself outlandish titles making himself more than what he is. As the story moves along I found myself laughing. There are some quirky lines that are memorable and imaginative. I opened my mind a little bit more to how this character's mind works. All in all, it was an okay read but it was missing something. I might appreciate this series as a whole once I read all three volumes. As for now, I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It was just okay. I didnt see any wow factor and anything spectatular about it. I fail to see why there are so many 5 stars reviews. There I'm at a lost.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Twenty-five years after her fifteen-year-old brother Ben supposedly murdered her mother and two sisters, Libby Day is struggling and at a point in her life when she must find a way to bring money into the coffers.  The fund that sustained her after the tragedies has dried up, and Libby flails about, seeking a solution.<br /><br />And what she finds is a group of individuals devoted to proving her brother was innocent--and willing to pay for mementos and information.<br /><br />Libby was seven years old when the murders happened, and the only survivor.  Her testimony put her brother behind bars, but now she is wondering if things happened the way she believed it did.  She reexamines the \\"darkplaces\\" to figure things out.  And starts meeting with people to find out more, too.  She also dreams about the events, with different scenarios each time.  And she recalls how life as the orphan has changed everything for her, too.<br /><br />The setting is a Kansas farm in a small town filled with gossipy, mean-spirited individuals seemingly bent on shunning the Day family long before the tragedy struck.<br /><br />In alternating narratives, [[ASIN:B0027MJU00 Dark Places: A Novel]] takes us back to 1985, to learn bits and pieces of that fateful day from the mother, Patty Day, and from Ben, the alleged perpetrator.  As more is revealed, we begin to have our own doubts...and as we follow Libby's first-person narration in the present, watching her accumulate data, the questions begin to grow until we wonder if there will ever be any definitive answers.<br /><br />All of the characters are flawed individuals, but beneath the surface of each, there is a hint of how they could be redeemed.  If only...<br /><br />What mysterious person did Patty Day meet that night?  Why is Ben so secretive about the events, and why is he denying having a girlfriend named Diondra?  What, if anything, did his friend Trey have to do with the tragic events?<br /><br />Like a tornado sweeping across the flatlands, the events come full circle until finally the reader knows it all.  And there were definitely some surprises.  Another unputdownable read from Gillian Flynn.  Five stars.latlands, the events come full circle until finally the reader knows it all.

1250012570|3.0|Oh, my - how do I begin? Well, first, let me say that I haven't read a YA book in a while. I'm climbing the bookish equivalent of Mount Everest this year - aka making my way through the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin and it is brutal. So maybe I went into this book not sure what to expect? I don't know what happened. I had hopes of romance and swooning and first love a la Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins, but that's not what I got. Instead I got this amazing boy whom I adored and a girl that annoyed me.<br /><br />The description says that you'll remember your own first love, and while it did have moments that reminded me of what it's like to fall in love for the first time, I just couldn't connect with Eleanor. Was she in a bad situation? Yes, but in times like those, you either let it make you or break and I feel like she let it break her. Again, yes, she's 16 and \\"helpless\\" but all I'm saying is that 16 is old enough to call the police and not give a second thought to \\"Oh, is my mom going to be mad that I'm doing something that she as 40 something year old can't?\\"<br /><br />The saving grace for me in this book is Park - not only the character but his POV (the book is alternating POVs). Without Park, this book would have probably been a Did Not Finish. Park - my sweet, sweet boy - WHY do you even like Eleanor? She pushes you away, is an emotional rollercoaster and disaster, and has got to be the most self-deprecating  character I've read in a while - she puts Edward Cullen from Twilight to shame.<br /><br />And speaking of favorite characters, I've got to say my overall favorite character (and the one I think is most like me) was Park's mom. She's an Avon lady who loves makeup, nails, and hair - AND she always wants to make other people over.<br /><br />I will say that I really enjoyed Rainbow Rowell's writing style and I'm reading her next book, Fangirl, right now and absolutely loving it. So it's just this particular book that didn't do it for me. Also, the narrator for Eleanor on the audiobook was not the best so that probably played into things a bit.<br /><br />I put this book on my Everyone Loved But Me shelf as there are no less than TWENTY 5 star reviews from my friends on GoodReads. Maybe I'm the misfit in this story.didn't do it for me.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is something of a rarity that I would write anything by way of review, however such was the hype surrounding this publication that I gave it a go and wish to very briefly share my thoughts in the aftermath.... I found the plot to be completely at odds with all logic and reason one would expect from a work so popular with women. The author romanticises abuse of women, schizophrenic episodes, Grey's being abused as an adolescent, irrational behaviour, stalker tendencies and any number of other huge character flaws simply because he is good looking and rich.....how he became a quasi billionaire by his late 20's... Well the author more or less lets the reader decide.<br /><br /> Frankly the entire book leads the reader on a long, slow, death by a thousand wounds type journey that goes nowhere..... At no point could I say I was 'into' the book and I never had the tendency to burn the midnight oil and turn another page. I found the character and plot gaps far too large to be accounted for simply because this is a work of fiction.....And oft felt conflicted within myself to even complete the book.<br /><br />I'd think long and hard about putting my worst enemy through its 500 pages.... Erotica will more than take the place of this book in terms of plugging a 'gap' if that's what's whetted ones appetite. Steer clear at all costs....

B001AITH50|4.0|It's strange to think that (at the time of this review) the film adaptation of Anne Rice's [[ASIN:0345409647 Interview with the Vampire]] is nearly twenty years old. Looking back at the likes of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst, it's funny to see where they've ended up since the release of this film! But most people, even big fans of the book, seem to generally agree that this is a good adaptation of the original novel, remaining faithful to the source material whilst still making the necessary changes in order to transfer it from page to screen (no doubt helped by the fact that it was Anne Rice herself who wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />In a darkened apartment in San Franciso, the vampire Louis tells his life story to a captivated journalist, divulging details on how he became a vampire, what it was like to make the transition, the companions that he spend years of his immortal life with, the struggle with his bloodlust and his quest to find answers as to the history and meaning of vampirism. Key players in his tale are the charismatic and selfish Lestat, the vampire who made Louis like him in body if not spirit, and Claudia, the little girl turned into a vampire and so doomed to spend all of eternity in a child's body.<br /><br />In the 18th century Louis was a wealthy plantation owner mourning the loss of his wife and child when he's approached by the vampire Lestat, who promises an end to his suffering. But unbeknownst to Louis, Lestat's motives are hardly altruistic. He's interested in the estate and lifestyle that Louis can provide him with, as well as in need of some companionship. Louis agrees to the change and in due time is transformed into a vampire. At first the two immortals get along well, with Lestat teaching Louis about how to drink blood and conceal himself in a coffin come daybreak, but eventually Louis becomes disillusioned with his companion's cruelty toward humans and his refusal to divulge any information on how he in turn became a vampire.<br /><br />In a bid to keep Louis by his side, Lestat turns a five year old girl that Louis (in a fit of despair and bloodlust) has drunk from into a vampire, thus binding the little family of three together forever. But as the years pass by and Claudia does not grow into a woman, she begins to question and then rail against the authority that Lestat holds over them. Of course, domestic arguments in a house full of vampires are significantly more murderous and bloody than what human beings are used to, and soon Louis and Claudia are on the run to Europe, seeking out other vampires in their search for answers.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt initially seem like bizarre casting choices as vampires considering their All-American Golden Boy personas, yet by some miracle they actually pull off the roles. Brad Pitt embodies a permanent air of sadness and thoughtfulness that brings depth into what is now a clich&eacute;: the broody, introspective, tormented vampire. His gloom and despondency is offset by Lestat's mockery and enjoyment of vampiric life, and though these days he's better known for scientology, multiple divorces and jumping on Oprah's couch, Cruise's performance as Lestat demonstrates that whatever else is going on in his life - the man can act. At different stages Lestat can be capricious, self-absorbed, charming, dangerous, terrifying, pathetic and hilarious. His interactions with Louis and Claudia as the patriarch of their strange little family forms the crux of the film, and his absence in the film's second half (due to the necessities of the plot) is sorely felt.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst is the real standout though. On paper it may sound relatively easy to play a vampire child (just look and sound creepy, right?) but Claudia is more than just that - she's a woman in a child's body. It really is extraordinary how well someone as young as Dunst was at the time could pull this off: that you can actually see her age from a child to a thirty-year old even though her appearance doesn't change at all. Yet in the first half of her appearance she has a child's mannerisms and speech patterns; in the second it's not difficult to imagine her as a very sophisticated young adult. And on top of all that, she has to capture the inherent creepiness of a bloodsucking fiend, reminding the audience that she's also someone to be scared of as well as fascinated by.<br /><br />In the final act we are introduced to Antonio Banderas as Armand, said to be the oldest living vampire in existence, and his coven of vampires which embody the dismal nature of immortality, alternating between clownish cruelty on the stage and lethargy in the underground crypt. It is these Parisian vampires that provide the fiery climax to the film, followed by Louis's gentle summing up of the most recent years of his life to the gob-smacked interviewer.<br /><br />It's a wholly unique storyline, yet it is the visual style of the whole thing that really raises the bar. Neil Jordan has always been good at crafting beautiful films, and he's completely at home in the supernatural genre. The period costumes, the opulent settings, the liters of crimson blood - it's all depicted in lavish detail and infused with a wickedly dark sense of humor. The artistry of the hair and makeup crew turn the cast into legitimately uncanny looking creatures of the night, and as the film was made on the cusp of computer graphics, in many ways it's a last hurrah for old school special effects.<br /><br />Sure, there are a few odd choices: Lestat biting Louis for the first time whilst levitating up through the air, and the blinking statue (to demonstrate the vividness of vampire senses) didn't work out as well on screen as it did in the book, but what Jordan really excels at is the depicting these unchangeable vampires passing through a variety of environments across the course of history.<br /><br />All in all, this is a surprisingly good film adaptation of a novel that changed the course of the vampire genre. With an intoxicating visual flair and better-than-expected performances from its cast, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" flips the perspective on vampires - no longer existing as a cautionary tale to human beings, but as characters in their own right.n though her appearance doesn't change at all.

B003UBTX72|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  His passion for music is infectious, and I loved the parts where he describes learning/playing/recording music.  The druggy stuff is interesting, at times fascinating, but ultimately kind of sad - what a waste of time and talent.  Who knows what he could have done without that idiocy?  But, we've all been young and stupid, so there you go...  Besides all that, it's a really easy read.  It's well written, fun, disarming and revealing (although, of course it's one-sided from Keith's perspective - where's Mick's book?).  Recommended.

B0067EKYVI|4.0|May 10th, 2013 marked the highly anticipated release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. This film marks the fourth time F. Scott Fitzgerald's glitzy classic has seen the big-screen treatment. It seems that in an almost poetic piece of truth, filmmakers have been reaching for their own `elusive green light' in that no one has been able to cinematically capture the full power and prestige of the classic novel. It's unusual for a book to be adapted to film every 25 years or so, but that is precisely what has happened. Alan Ladd played the mysterious Jay Gatsby in 1949, Robert Redford in 1974, Toby Stephens in the deplorable A&E TV movie in 2000, and now Leonardo Dicaprio steps into that legendary yellow car's driver's seat. Is the fourth time a charm?<br /><br />It's the roaring 20s in America and in the midst of America's strongest economic boom in history, Nick Caraway (Toby Maguire) puts his writing career on hold and leaves the Midwest for the magic of New York as a bond salesman. Caraway becomes fascinated with his mysterious neighbor (Gatsby) as rumors about the man and his wealth circulate all around him. Nick is drawn into Gatsby's lavish world and through him, the audience is presented Fitzgerald's cautionary fable of excess, greed, and moral decay that lies beneath the surface of social luxury.<br /><br />Fourth time a charm? The answer to this question is a complex one. The appeal to this film rests in the impeccable casting of Dicaprio as Gatsby and the choice of such a distinctive director in Luhrmann. Luhrmann and Dicaprio have, of course, successfully updated a classic once before with 1996's Romeo + Juliet. While The People's Critic was not that impressed with that film, it can be admired for its style and individuality. The Great Gatsby does not disappoint in terms of its style, which is no surprise given Luhrmann's reputation.<br /><br />The film chooses to introduce Caraway slightly differently from the novel, and in that commits its first mistake. The tone of the film is altered right from the start, and Caraway's character is strangely identified as a flawed and beaten down man; he is introduced as a man clinging to sanity. Fans of the book will also be incredibly disappointed in some glaringly missing elements from the film's final act. These changes result in a sacrifice of some major complexities within a major character's past. Nonetheless, the middle section of the film is faithful to the novel and develops very well.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out nicely with Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan and Joel Edgerton as her husband Tom. Isla Fisher plays Tom's mistress Myrtle and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki plays the vapid vamp, Jordan Baker. Luhrmann is guilty of rushing the pace a bit too much when it comes to developing these characters, but this is likely because he knows the story swings on the hinge of Gatsby and Caraway's relationship. Unfortunately the pacing does affect the film's effectiveness. This and some astonishingly poor editing reduces the film's overall impact. Consequently, Maguire effectively sets up awe and majesty for the appearance of Dicaprio, although the anticipated reveal of his character is not quite as satisfying as it should be.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a story of mood. A successful adaptation must transcend regurgitation of plotpoints and allow the viewer to feel and experience the raw nature of desire and time's fleeting nature. It is here that Luhrmann does succeed. The major victory for this film is in its capturing of the essence of the novel, the time, and the message. Bold choices from contemporary music, effective use of slow motion, and inventive camera placement make the movie exciting and at times, well...Great. I do, however, question the decision for executive producer Jay-Z to use four songs by himself or Beyonce in a film that so urgently attacks bravado, audacity, and arrogance. The Great Gatsby is the best adaptation of Fitzgerald's material, and Dicaprioadds another iconic role to his ever impressive career. While the film is not perfect and will certainly provide some disappointments for fans of the book, the film does stand on its own as a determined, flashy, show-piece of entertainment. Badds another iconic role to his ever impressive career.

B0090SI4LU|2.0|I understand that not all movies can translate the original book well, and I am usually okay with changes to the storyline/characters if it ends up being a a better MOVIE. However, after seeing the film, I was left unsatisfied. I understood it would be awkward to bring to the screen since most of the discussion between Melanie and Wanda is internal, but even with low expectations, it fell short.<br /><br />Several characters from the book were not mentioned in the film, such as Sharon. Doc's character was also not really developed, although he is in the film. However, these were changes I could accept, because the change helped focus on some of the main characters, and the plot details were fixed accordingly for the film.<br /><br />Something I was NOT okay with was how Wanda/Wanderer seemed so weak in the movie. In the book, she comes off as strong in addition to being pacifist. Her background and decisions in the book showed her strength. However, in the movie, many of these scenes were changed to be Melanie leading instead. Some examples from the movie (spoiler alert) include Melanie being the one to tell Wanda how to get the medicine at the hospital and Melanie telling Wanda to not tell people she's alive at first. To make Melanie be in so much control of the body, of all the decisions -- it was a bit tiring to see Wanda's character ask Melanie about everything, and it made me feel like there was not as much depth to Wanda's character. It's as though the writer/director wanted the focus to be Melanie, when I thought the original story has them both be strong heroines.<br /><br />Some things I did enjoy was how William Hurt portrayed Uncle Jeb, which I thought matched the personality in the book exactly. Saoirse Ronan seemed like a better Wanda than Melanie, but seemed more frail than I expected for the character of Melanie. Max Irons/Jared felt a little stilted and I didn't ever get a sincere feeling from his acting with the exception of his first encounter withMelanie. (I'm not sure how much of that is the fault of the acting, or the awkward translation of the film.) Diane Kruger also portrayed the Seeker well for the movie (accounting for the character changes in the movie), and I believe she was the best as showing the fraying control to the host body.<br /><br />Overall, if you're new to \\"The Host\\", I highly recommend reading the book instead.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I remember being a child reading Marvel comic books by the dozens.  I'm going to get a little nostalgic now, so if you're just interested in a review of the film, move on to the next paragraph.  I'd go to comic books stores weekly to get my favorite issues and become immersed in the stories and the artwork.  The static images were vibrant in my mind, and occasionally as I imagined the action between the comic panels, I'd ponder how glorious it would be to see my favorite heroes come to life.  It seemed like a pipe dream, but now it seems that the day has actually come.  Iron Man 3 represents the eighth spectacular achievement in the Avengers vein by Marvel studios as they revolutionize the concept of the film franchise.  The cinematic universe that Marvel studios has created achieves a detailed serial nature usually reserved for complex television dramas.  The success of these films is often attributed to their effects and unyielding action.  Nevertheless, the greatest titles, Iron Man 3 being one of them, deserve their status because of clever writing and character development.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 finally finds the suited up superhero, Tony Stark pitted against his greatest nemesis, The Mandarin.  While Iron Man's battle with The Mandarin in the comics dates back to 1964, The Mandarin's role in Iron Man's cinematic adventures has only been hinted at in the previous two films.  Thanks to clever and creative writing from director Shane Black and screenwriter Drew Pearce as well as a superb performance by the great Ben Kingsley, The Mandarin was well worth the wait...and that's all I'll say.<br /><br />For the sake of keeping Iron Man 3's impact in tact, plot should be discussed minimally.  What can be said is that a new terrorist, The Mandarin is violently attacking America in order to expose what he believes is a hypocritical and offensive ideology shared by the American people.  At one point, Stark mentions that he \\"sounds like a Baptist minister,\\" suggesting perhaps that he's using \\"crisis\\" as a way to force decision, a controversial Baptist philosophy.  It gets personal when Stark's head of security, Happy Hogan (played again by Iron Man 1 & 2 director, Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in one of The Mandarin's attacks.  There is much more to the story including a minor flashback to 1999 where Stark is just hitting his stride.  It is there that he meets bourgeoning scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and \\"botanist\\" Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), and again...that's all I'll say.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is a very smartly made film, and while it still addresses comic book staple themes like good/evil, identity, revenge, and freedom, an emergent theme can also be extracted from it - learning from mistakes.  Film series usually start to run out of steam by the third part, with few exceptions.  A third film in a series tends to be darker and excessive in regards to whatever made the first two work be it action, villains, or some sort of familiar formula.  Iron Man 3 learns from others' mistakes and avoids them.  In fact, it can be said that this film acts as a \\"how-to\\" manual on freshening up conventions.  In scenes where the hero is captured by henchmen who are normally silent and sinister, Shane Black and Drew Pearce devise witty and even humorous dialogue that makes those scenes enjoyable.  At one point, Iron Man must team up with a child, a move that often results in schmaltzy sentimentality, yet in the hands of Black and Pearce it works.  By the end of Iron Man 3, it is clear that these film makers are thinking quite a few moves ahead and have no intention of letting the audience down at any point.  The film has fun with Stark's Iron Man identity being public knowledge and various nods to The Avengers add another level of substance and self-referential fun.  Robert Downey Jr. has certainly found a home in his role as Stark/Iron Man.  This installment is his best as he tactfully and authentically balances humor, intensity, and sentimentality without ever missing a beat.<br /><br />Other favorites are back as well including Rhodey (Don Cheadle) formally War Machine, now dubbed the Iron Patriot and Stark's reliable CFO/lover Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The other star of this film is the Iron Man suit itself.  JARVIS and the suit have made some exciting and enjoyable upgrades that are quite central to the evolution of the story.  Iron Man 3 is another excellent entry into an ever-blooming genre of film.  It is entertaining, gratifying, and most of all - clever. A<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is rated PG-13 with a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It should be seen in 2D rather than 3D as nothing is gained from the 3D transfer.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It is fair to say that J. J. Abrams is a man who has found quite a bit of success within the entertainment industry.  In fact, his name likely appears on the top of a very, very short list of encouraging up-and-coming writers, producers, directors, and creators.  While few milestones are left for him to achieve, Star Trek Into Darkness does happen to represent his first responsibility as director of a sequel and a high-profile one at that.  Since it is no secret that Abrams will be helming the most highly anticipated set of sequels of all time in terms of the upcoming Star Wars episodes; Star Trek Into Darkness has a little more riding on it than usual.  Fortunately, Abrams and company have done it again, in that Star Trek Into Darkness is nothing short of spectacular!<br /><br />After a four year wait, the crew of the Enterprise is back on the big screen.  Into Darkness hits the ground running with a wild, stylish opening segment that reminds us that hot-shot Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) doesn't play by anybody else's rules.  However, this time his cavalier philosophy finally catches up with him.  Kirk's chance at redemption comes at the cost of an attack on star fleet by a mysterious mad-man by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Harrision's attack and subsequent retreat to hostile space leads Kirk and crew on an inter-galactic man-hunt that tests their strength, courage, and relationships.<br /><br />The film looks very good and while heavy on special effects, they do not overwhelm the movie.  Abrams shot much of this film on the lot in Paramount Studios, but he was able to use realistic staging quite often, resulting in action scenes where the actors actually were able to interact with the environment and be immersed in the reality of it.  A clear example of this is a fantastic fight scene near the end of the film that takes place on top of multiple levitating barges.  The actors filmed this scene on actual moving platforms, which aid in creating a very intense tone for a pivotal scene.<br /><br />A major strength of Abrams's first Star Trek was the expert casting, and that remains so in Into Darkness.  All of the iconic roles are filled with performers who understand how to balance the legacy of their characters' reputations with the modern turn necessary to freshen up the franchise.  Especially excellent is Zachary Quinto who plays a more sensitive Spock, while still preserving the stone-cold-logical element that all fans have embraced for nearly fifty years.  While inside tongue-in-cheek references are aplenty, non-trekies will be none-the-wiser and will not feel like they are missing something.  Nonetheless, Abrams does not let the notoriously passionate fans down and creates another film that will certainly have devotees reeling, laughing, and gasping at several carefully nuanced touches; study up on your Klingon!<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is far simpler in story and scope than its predecessor, which may disappoint those looking for twists and turns that fans of Abrams have come to expect from his work on television shows like Lost and Fringe.  While straightforward and uncomplicated in terms of plot, it is a lot of fun.  The pacing is swift, the action is great, and the all of the humor works.  Star Trek Into Darkness substantiates the latest voyages of the Starship Enterprise, which will surely live long and inevitably pro$per!  A-<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 3 minutes.  While it was apparently not shot in 3-D, it was shot in IMAX, and the 3-D conversion is top notch and not disappointing.

B006BQFUOS|4.0|I watched the movie while I was reading the book.  I really enjoyed the movie, they did a nice job of cramming in an entire book to a 2 hour movie.  I would suggest both, movie and book.
B008JFUMHE|4.0|In 2006's The Prestige, Michael Caine plays a magician mentor who says, \\"Making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.\\"  In Now You See Me, Caine plays a very different character who in one scene learns this lesson in a very painful way.  Now You See Me is like The Prestige-Lite, but that doesn't mean it's not good.<br /><br />According to Now You See Me, successful illusions are the result of misdirection and timing. In a summer teeming with sequels, it is refreshing to see an occasional original idea hit the theaters, and it is this misdirection and successful timing that perhaps enhances the appeal of this film.  In one of the year's most enjoyable opening scenes, four unique illusionists (Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco) are drawn together by a mysterious individual who provides them with the blueprints to a spectacular act that only they are capable of performing as a team.  The team, now known as the Four Horsemen, begins performing a series of illusions that involve various heists including the robbery of a major Paris bank.  Ironically, the spoils of these robberies go not to the victors but to the audience of the show!  This Robin Hood-esque form of vigilantism draws the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is given the exceptionally difficult task of proving exactly how the Four Horsemen are guilty of these robberies.<br /><br />Casting is by far one of the film's major attributes.  Eisenberg's awkward, self-deprecating persona is put aside for one with much stronger bravado; watching him play J. Daniel Atlas is sort of like watching him play Mark Zuckerberg on personality steroids, in other words - kind of great.  Woody Harrelson does a great job as mentalist Merritt McKinney, which he plays kind of like Sherlock Holmes...on personality steroids - so also kind of great.  Dave Franco and Isla Fisher are very effective, but far less central to the film's development.  Ruffalo and his partner Alma (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) are great at revealing the frustration of chasing down the clever illusionists, and Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine expertly provide further dimension to the story by exploring the darker side of \\"magic's\\" purpose.<br /><br />Now You See Me has a lot of fun with its premise.  Director, Louis Leterrier packs the film with style and tricks of the trade that keep the story moving and rather captivating.  Leterrier, mostly known for action films like The Incredible Hulk and the first two Transporter films, takes a crack at an ensemble piece where he must balance story with numerous characters - all the while keeping the audience in the dark about the exact motivations of these characters.  He is mostly successful at this, but the film requires a rather high level of suspension of disbelief and some serious overlooking of plot-holes.  It also has a bit of an unevenness to it as Leterrier cannot quite lose his proclivity for action and crowbars a 15 minute car chase smack in the middle of the film.  The scene is brilliantly shot and very exciting, but it also involves virtually none of the film's main characters and thus, feels a bit superfluous.<br /><br />Now You See Me is a lot of fun and fortunately, it does not run out of steam at the end.  Too often films like this are all set-up and no delivery, but the ending of Now You See Me is satisfying and very appropriate.  Hopefully, Now You See Me will find an audience and remind movie studios that once in a while an original idea is worth their consideration before they green-light Fast and Furious 12: Where Did I Put My Keys?

B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|This is an unusual movie, but very fun.  You have to watch it a couple times to catch all the tie ins from the past to the future.  Using the same actors made it very interesting.
B00CMT54DA|5.0|While some movies that Matthew McConaughey is in are great, few movies are great because Matthew McConaughey is in them.  Now, that may seem like a cheap shot (and it is), but it should be overlooked because Mud represents his best film and performance since 2002's Frailty.<br /><br />Mud is a slice of Americana.  Two young Arkansas boys, Ellis and Neckbone, happen upon a runaway convict hiding out on a deserted island in the Mississippi.  McConaughey plays the convict known only as \\"Mud.\\"  He is charming and mysterious, and as his story begins to come into focus, the boys are swayed to help him fix up a broken down boat so he can meet up with his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and escape down the river to freedom.  Now if this sounds slightly familiar, perhaps you're thinking of another slice of Americana where two boys try to help a social outcast find his family and escape captivity by traversing the Mississippi River: Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  The parallels between Mud and Finn are actually quite numerous, most notably that both examine the trials of a young boy's integrity.  Whether or not director and writer Jeff Nichols is intentionally invoking Finn, he has nevertheless created a fine companion to the 1885 novel.<br /><br />The success of Mud lies in the hands of McConaughey and relative newcomer Tye Sheridan, who plays Ellis.  As the unlikely relationship forms between them, Nichols is able to weave in significant observations about fatherhood, childhood, love, and respect.  Protection is a recurring motif that truly sits at the heart of the film.  In fact, known for taking his shirt off, it is ironic that in Mud, McConaughey's shirt remains on as a symbolic form of protection.  Consequently, it is actually quite significant when it is ceremoniously and inevitably removed.<br /><br />Mud is certainly no technical achievement and will no doubt be lost in the shuffle as the flashy summer blockbusters start releasing, but it is a strong resonating film full of the kind of tension, drama, humor, and realism Mark Twain would be proud of.

B008JFUOVI|3.0|I'm not sure what critics were expecting to see when they went to see The Hangover Part III, but clearly they didn't see it. Words like `deplorable,' `tasteless,' `unfunny,' and `indecent' have been used to describe the film, not to mention the all too repeated yet inevitable phrase `what happened in Vegas, should have stayed in Vegas.' I, on the other hand, must profoundly disagree with this vastly baffling majority. The Hangover Part III is a fitting final chapter that is far from `tasteless,' and in fact even expresses some rather poignant truths about friendship.<br /><br />The Hangover Part III wisely turns its back on the \\"what happened last night?\\" premise, and freshens things up with a new conflict, although it still involves looking for Doug. This time the Wolfpack assembles for an intervention for Allen (Zack Galifianakis) following the sudden death of his father (Jeffery Tambor) and a terribly public mishap with a giraffe. While enroute to a mental rehabilitation facility, Allen, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) are abducted by mobster, Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall orders Phil, Stu, and Allen to track down Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) who stole $21 million in gold from him or he'll kill Doug. It seems oddly hypocritical that series like the Harry Potter films are allowed to break with formula and get significantly darker over time, yet when a film like The Hangover Part III does the same, there is an uproar. Nonetheless, this new direction allows the characters more room to breathe as they commence an enjoyable manhunt that takes them to California, to Tiajuana, and of course, to Vegas!<br /><br />Various nods to the previous two films are sprinkled throughout in enjoyable ways and even the Marshall character is fittingly introduced. Jeong's role is substantially larger in this installment, and while his presence felt far too forced and substantial in the second film, he shines in Part III. It is true that there are not as many laughs in The Hangover Part III as there were in the original, but it also has a different tone where laughs are sacrificed for occasional moments of intensity. Nonetheless, the film is still a comedy, and the laughs that happen are strong and surpass the lazy unoriginal ones from Part II. In fact, this film minimizes its references to Part II to such a degree that this film could be considered Part II, and Part II could be a sort of appendix or something.<br /><br />The argument for whether Part III (or Part II) was necessary is a larger issue that does not only apply to this set of films but to all part II's and part III's. Thus, on the merits of what is presented, The Hangover Part III is a successful and entertaining film. It devises a reasonable premise, offers a clever plot-twist or two, and even provides some insight on friendship. The latter part is perhaps the film's least successful endeavor, as it pounds the audience over the head with various versions of Trent Reznor's song \\"Hurt;\\" however, a scene towards the end utilizing that song does have a ring of truth to it.<br /><br />Director Todd Phillips listened to his critics and detractors after Part II and gave them exactly what they wanted in Part III, yet his new vision is not being embraced. While the franchise has seemingly run out of steam, and a Hangover Part IV is incredibly unlikely and ill-advised, Part III is a perfectly good send off to these characters that deserves to be seen even if the \\"hang\\" is \\"over.\\" B<br /><br />The Hangover Part III is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. While there is no stinger after the credits, definitely make sure you stick around for about a minute after the credits begin rolling.laughs in The Hangover Part III as there were in the original, but it also has a different tone where laughs are sacrificed for occasional moments of intensity.

B004PYDBVM|5.0|I chose a 5 for this rating because during the Korean wars I was in high school, just entering college.  As a young college student I was focused on my  own life and just making it to the next level.  I knew there was fighting in the Koreas, but truthfully, it seemed  was so far detached from my REAL life that I had no idea of the atrocities and brutality that were going on. I acquired a tremendous amount of information from this book (as well as from ''Escape from Camp 14'').  Until this time I was viewing the world through rose-colored glasses. These two books left me devastated. I felt as though someone had kicked me in the stomach!  Honestly, I had no idea such horrors were taking place in the World while I was sitting here, blessed I might add, living a very normal middle-class life! I think this is probably typical of most of the people (at least the women) who were in college during these years. These books were a REAL EDUCATION for me.

B000001GXB|5.0|Hymn-like passages, anger, longing, humor, parody, unique, sublime, powerful are all terms that are apt descriptions for Beethoven's late piano sonatas. Maurizio Pollini's performance of these works is stellar, his interpretations of these works, in my opinion, is without equal. The sound quality of the recording, even though decades old now, remains quite good even compared with present-day technology. These works and this recording in particular is a prerequisite for a serious music library. You will not regret making this purchase.

I really loved Libby, and just when I thought I'd figured something out, things would change. Dark Places was well written, and the descriptions, especially of the crime and of the town were quite good. I'll definitely continue on with Gone Girl. Love Gillian Flynn's style. Another good book I recommend.

The main characters all seemed to be about as dysfunctional as they could be, but I wouldn't call any of them far fetched.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Compared to other plots in the previous books this one is weaker.  The beginning is intriguing but when the villains plan is revealed at the end it's really disappointing.  The villain created a labyrinth of events to seek revenge on Sookie when there were much easier options available.  I'm happy were Sookie's journey ended but the drama was weak.
030758836X|5.0|At first I wasn't going to bother with Gone Girl due to so many complaints regarding the ending. But I gave it a go through anyway. There are no spoilers here, but I'll just say that Gillian Flynn wrote the ending while staying true to the characters she developed. Had she of changed anything, you'd sit there telling yourself...\\"Such and such wouldn't have done that\\"..so bravo Gillian Flynn. Great job!
0061134007|4.0|My first Nesbo book. It provides a great plot, and I enjoyed the way Nesbo speeds up the action it is almost like watching a movie the way his prose races you through sequences. Would not say his writing is evocative, it's straight and to the point with exceptions given to his environment more so than the characters. There are a lot of characters to keep up with as well, and some confusion and rereading took place on my part on that account. I like the way Nesbo imparts the reasoning of his characters for what they are doing, and that not everyone ends up punished for their actions. Despite a lot of flashback chapters it does not seem a disjointed story. An enjoyable read, but will say that I would not buy another Nesbo book for the writing so the story and setting has to appeal to me. By the way, I did buy another Nesbo book ha ha. Wish I could give 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the more I go over the book in my mind the more I appreciate the plot and how Nesbo gives perspective from two generation's thought processes.

This album is a solid effort, but I always save my 5 stars for an album of epic quality. There wasn't anything groundbreaking, but hey...its Joe Satriani, he's been around forever, he can do whatever he wants and he will pump out some good tunes. At least he is making music that fits to his emotions. Buy the album and I do not think you will be disappointed. Like I said, every song on the album is a decent listen. My favorites are probably Unstoppable Momentum, A Door Into Summer and The Weight of the World.

B0010T0OCY|4.0|Dark City is a combo of Metropolis and Kafka: it sheds its skin and repeatedly reincarnates--always in the shadows of broken time/space. Sewell sports noir to match director Alex Proyas's relentless gloom and stunning visual intrigue.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Its definetly worth your money. When you get this game, you are going to be hooked on it for a very long time

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is truly amazing, from the wonderful graphics to the intriguing puzzle.  This is surely the best 1.99 I have ever spent!!!  I am not usually a puzzle solving type of person, however this is addicting!!!  Trying to talk all my friends and family into buying it!!  Can't wait for the next one!!

0345803485|2.0|After hearing so much of these books in the media I thought I give it a try to see what all the fuss was about. She's not a bad author (and very tough to write this on a tabu topic), I just didn't like the story. The sex scenes were discribed pretty much the same and the rest of the story were kind of dull, it didnt happy anything espescially noteworthy. I also find it very unlikely that Christian Grey would find the main character interesting and attractive for many reasons. The fact that he is a billionaire and buys her a lot of things (like a car) and has an helicopter makes it even more unlikely. She, who has never had sex before, makes quite some debut and the sex is probably way off what normal people do in bed. I could probably go on and on about things I find weird, unlikely and don't like in this book. I will not read the other books, if I do (which I highly doubt) it is to find out if the story get's any interesting at all.
B007V65R54|5.0|I'm currently re-reading this book and am a fan of Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog on the WSJ website. I was introduced to Silver's work as the Republican primaries were tracking towards a candidate. I remember running across a reference to Silver's statistical models while working for a Fantasy Sports aggregator so the name had struck a cord, when mentioned by a friend to me. As the race towards the election started to heat up, I would visit the blog daily (just as I would all of the various media sites, both conservative and liberal). What I liked about FiveThirtyEight was the reliance on math as applied to a predictive model, which enticed me to purchase this book.<br /><br />The book does some interesting things from the very beginning, exploring the concept of Big Data and how that affects analysis and continuing to apply those concepts to real world scenarios - including a very good description of how the financial melt-down of 2008 happened and the events that lead to that point in history. It's fairly finance heavy but still understandable - actually I think I got more from those first couple of chapters than all the other reading I did during the collapse and now via historical perspective. Kudos to Silver for doing a good job in peeling that apart and making it approachable.<br /><br />I especially like the main premise, which is how to look and measure relevant data while being exposed to an over-abundance of cruft, then using that data to make strong predictive models. To understand the concept, think about doing simple key-word searches on Google - the number or return-hits can be astronomical. While the first few results may be relevant, as you page through the results the number of insignificant hits decreases proportional to a score, based on how the search engine interprets the number of times your words are used on the websites or documents returned. This actually only implies relevance - the problem is that with so much data available, the user still has to decide what to use as reference. To make matters worse, the engine relies on the frequency of the words and not of the contextual relevance of the sentence built by those words. And at the end of the even-less-relevant spectrum, many sites are created to intentionally misdirect the searcher with bad information. All of this would qualify as Noise as defined by Silver (the reference is old radio, how to get through all the static to the station you want to hear clearly) - so how to get the right Signal with all that going on?<br /><br />Going back to the election, with so much noise to penetrate, it's easy to see how facts can be ignored while other facts are emphasized, to support your own views and/or argument. It also explains how the losing party could have been so convinced of victory, picking and choosing only those statistics that support the party while ignoring all else as \\"media bias\\" - Silver has proven that by first applying the judicious use of data, then an algorithm that adjusts daily poling numbers based on past performance, a relatively accurate predictive model is possible to produce. I'll end the review here so there is something for others to discover in this work.l has to decide what to use as reference.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am horrible about keeping my Kindle charged. With this app I can make delegate my usage while with a customer so that I can still deliver a stunning presentation! It also helps with the simple tasks like helping me figure out if I have enough time to watch a video or play a game. It's a great app!
1591841666|5.0|I've long held that I \\"just knew when to go or quit\\" and now Seth's given me the metaphors to realize the truth.<br /><br />Like many others, the word \\"quit\\" brings a very negative connotation...so avoidance seems natural.  What Seth says about understanding the truth about \\"go / no-go\\" was a welcome relief and confirmed in my mind what I instinctively knew already.<br /><br />Simple truth...worth the read...but even more make the application and you'll thank Seth over and over.
0307744434|5.0|Two practitioners of magic continue a long standing competition between them, using proteges as the game pieces. One is the daughter, Celia who was left with her father after her mother's suicide. The other is an orphan, Marco. Each learns magic in different forms, with Celia becoming a master illusionist, while Marco's work is through written runes and spells. The location for their game is a traveling circus, but is no ordinary carnival. A group of interesting individuals come together to design the circus, with one of them commissioning a fantastical clock that is the centerpiece. The circus is only open at night, with each tent holding different wonders. Celia and Marco use the circus as the chessboard in their battle, with Celia working at the circus, not knowing at first who her opponent is. As the game progresses, the stakes grow higher as love, betrayal and wonderment enter the picture. This was an incredibly enchanting book that drew me in full force. I wanted to don my red scarf and follow the circus across the world, exploring each of the tents, marveling at the wonders within. The story envelopes you and draws you into this magical world. I cannot do the book justice in a review. All I can see is read it and enjoy it yourself. As recommended to me, paying careful attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter is key for following the flow of the story as it goes back and forth in time. I cannot wait for the author's next book.
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|I have been a fan of Inna for a very long time, and a fan of House Music for an even longer amount of time. I know real house music when I hear it and this is album is House. Catchy beats and lyrics with good vocals is what this album is made of. I have listened to the whole album 20+ times through and I just can't get enough. I paid 40 USD for this album so it's what I expected since it's 4 times the amount of a normal album because it was imported. It was definitely worth it though.The title speaks for itself. When you are listening to this album, the Party Never Ends.<br /><br />Buy this album,<br />Fellow Club Rocker

B008UX2UIO|2.0|Obviously I don't have the same sense of humor as the author or the same appreciation as those who gave it a major literary prize.  It seems to me that the major character in a book should have some redeeming factors.

1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander adds one more brick to the path of understanding. We are given another glimpse. Our physical environment from the infinitesimal &#34;strings&#34; to the limitless universe is probably just one piece of a much larger puzzle. If we can comprehend that our universe is infinite what makes us think that our “God” can be anything less. And heaven?, just another level or dimension our spirit or “consciousness” goes when our body dies? Who knows. We will probably never even begin to know all the answers but we are built to keep asking the questions and filling in the blanks. Maybe in a billion years..........but in the meantime, maybe we should try to understand and be guided by the information we've already been given.

1400052181|5.0|I loved this book so am buying a copy as a gift to a dear friend.  The story was very well written and researched by author, Skloot.  It takes one back in time (the 50s) when attitudes and medicine were certainly different and the importance of one seemingly insignificant woman's cancer cells.  It's a &#34;must read.&#34;
B00AWFEBDK|5.0|A little digressive in the late chapters but it's everything you expect from this master of the big picture: erudition, scholarship, vision,compassion,and a lively engaging writing style that makes reading it a pleasure.

B009UX2YAC|2.0|I really hate how it does not update right away like all other devices. I really want the update on my kindle, what gives?? I'm missing out on all the limited items too. This needs changed now!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game. Very fun. Unique and well thought out. Very fun for a relaxing game. It is engaging enough to keep you entertained but not so much that you can't play sleep deprived.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Cooperative, peaceful, unique, interesting game. I really like it. There are a few flaws but its very complex for a phone game. I think they did a good job with it and seem to have taken out flaws others complained about like too many ads.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book gives parents of children with the same struggles as the main character a Silver Lining to hope for.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I was not ready for the graphic and sexual content.. I thought it was just a r rated comedy but was very uncomfortable and had to leave the room while my kids(18 to 22) were in the room. I am not an old fashion parent and brought my kids to R rated movie probably earlier than any of there friends in Philadelphia.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|These are quickly becoming my go-to headphones. I'm a bit of an audio enthusiast, so much so that' I've developed tinnitus over the years (I play music, mix it, listen to it constantly). I've owned various flavors of Sennheiser and Grado in the $80-$250 range. Since developing tinnitus I can no longer use Grados because they make my tinnitus really flare up and Sennheisers just don't work for me.<br /><br />Money is tight, so I've been on the hunt for decent headphones in the $80-$100 range. Also, I've been looking for a pair that are easy to drive because I don't want to carry an amp around, plus I like the convenience of using my smartphone as a music player. After much auditioning I've come to these, and I love them!<br /><br />I need to play my music at about 1/4 volume max to keep the pain away and these are just so silky smooth at that level. As I turn them up they flatten out and some of the finer details start emerging more, which distracts my 'inner-mixologist' because flaws in the music/mix/source start to pop out more, which makes these sound more like monitors. This feature is great for mixing though, so being one who mixes this is a bit of a win/win, but some folks who prefer louder listening levels might find these too flat and fatiguing.<br /><br />They are  more comfortable than my Grados, and this is before I mod them with Beyer pads, which as I understand makes these far more comfortable still. Stock they aren't perfect though. They are nice and cushiony but the pleather gives me hot spots.<br /><br />Construction seems solid overall. The long curled cord is great for the studio, but awkward on the go.<br /><br />You should know that there is a hot debate as to whether these or the Sony MDR-V6s are better. Because audiophiles debate this so often that must mean they will sound essentially the same to most of us, and that's because they ARE essentially the same. The grounds are wired a bit differently  and the 7506s have a gold-plated plug while theV6s are nickel-plated, but this has no effect sonically, so essentially they are the same thing.<br /><br />Great headphones! Go audition them at a place like Guitar Center and if you like them then get the V6s. I wish I had known about the V6s before making my purchase, but I never ran across them while auditioning and fell in love with these instantly, so I bought them on the spot. Still a great value at $100 though.
B004GYY714|5.0|It's very good. Most of my stations are on here. I love the music and the sound is great. I recommend this to anyone who loves music.

B00CW665VI|3.0|\\"Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away. We Crawl.\\" - Drew Evans<br /><br />Okay here is the deal. I liked the book I did, I just didn't love it. Maybe my expectations were too high after hearing a million and one awesome things about this book. I heard its fun, sexy, different, romantic... I have heard it all. I was going into this book expecting the world and I didn't get it. It was me, not the book- you know that line, it was me not you? Well that is how I feel about the book. Maybe my expectations were just too darn high!<br /><br />Tangled is about playboy, investment banker Drew Evans. He has it all; the money, the job, the different woman in his bed every night. He thought he had it all anyway until Kate Brooks walks into his life and throws his perfect bachelor universe into a whirl spin. Suddenly Drew has to prove his love for Kate and show her he is not really his playboy persona he once was.<br /><br />I absolutely, positively love the idea of the book; and I LOVE Drew, I mean what girl wouldn't right? I think the book being solely in Drew's point of view is genius; totally different and refreshing. I loved having an honest guy's opinion about women and relationships. I laughed out loud at a few scenes and even had to share it with my husband who I knew would get a kick out of it, especially the Braveheart movie line. The author Emma Chase is truly clever and original.<br /><br />I'm not going anywhere and that what I feel for you isn't going to change. And then someday- maybe not any time soon, but one day- I'm going to tell you that you, Kate Brooks, are the love of my life, and you won't have any doubt that it's true.\\"<br /><br />Sounds great right? I couldn't wait to read this book and once I had it I read the entire book in one day. So why didn't I love it you ask? Well, once Drew became this romantic hero the books feel just changed. Kate & Drew spent two nights together (and both nights were full of SEX, lots of SEX) and suddenly he is in love, like the forever type love and he is Mr. Romeo with songs, and jewelry, and all the other crazy romantic things he does for Kate to make her love him too. I felt this book became a bit cheesy right round here and I did not feel any type of REAL connection between Drew & Kate. Now lust I felt, potential to love I felt, but full on forever LOVE? No I didn't feel it at all, at least not realistic love. I was hoping it was more emotional but it was a fun read. Just don't expect an amazing romance story.<br /><br />The first half of the book was amazing, total 5 star potential here and I was really into the book and Drew for most of it. Drew might have been a playboy in the past but he was a good guy deep down. He made me laugh along with his friends and his brutal insight into the male brain and way of thinking. But once I felt the storyline shift into something else completely I started to skim the pages near the end.<br /><br />Over all, I just wish Kate & Drew's relationships developed more into something real with more time spent between the two before Drew went all crazy Romeo on Kate. I would have liked the last 15% of the book be about Drew trying to gain Kate's love AFTER the two developed more of a relationship instead of a weekend full of sex and LOTS of sex may I add.<br /><br />I did enjoy the author's creatively with Drew and his character. I loved the book was done totally in a man's POV, and I love the idea of the book. It had so much potential to be an amazing, 5 stars, reread over and over again type of book but I just couldn't feel it.<br /><br />I hate to say it but....<br /><br />I give Tangled 3 Starsoks feel just changed.

B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is a BackAndForthHiddenObjectGame -BAFHOG.  The entire game is finding objects and either using them to progress (a key had to be tried many times before it worked; it kept telling me that it couldn't be used here) or you collect objects and go back &amp; forth to apply them. There is a pop-up window when you are done in that area for the time being and then tells you when that particular stage has been completed. There is also a walk thrum guide if you get stuck.  For me the game was very boring; I don't mind HO being a part of the game but not the entire game. I'm glad this was a freebie.  This is a great game for kids but advise them that a lot of objects are truly hidden- for instance a carrot may only have a small tip showing. Download was super quick and there were no real glitches using the K-Fire.  Main reason for a 5 star was for the Kindle Kids out there.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|I stayed up until 4 in the morning to finish this novel. This is a must read for those who already love and enjoy the classics like Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and Great Expectations, and the like. Besides the love story itself, the richest part is the character development: a hero becomes the villain and a villain becomes the hero, all moved by love, hope, and even despair.
0805204156|3.0|Long and...  infuriating?<br /><br />One begins to understand that the author, in order to make you understand the plight of his protagonist, intends to bring you both to a place of exhaustion.  Had I known it was unfinished, I probably would never have begun the book, but, even incomplete, one gets the idea.  400 or so pages and you see clearly that the author could have gone on for another 400 in order to get his point across.<br /><br />It would be too simple to say Kafka's lesson is that bureaucracy is dehumanizing, or the futility of continuing effort in the face of the absurd.  I would argue that most of the villager's fears of rules, or of the castle, exist only in their head.  Time and time again it is shown that a certain thing must be done not because the castle decrees it, but because the social order of the village peasants requires it.<br /><br />Thus, while we see the bureaucracy is indeed absurd, it is made that way not from above, but from below, and the real enemy in this book are the social conventions and standards of propriety among the common people.  Which is quite a good theme, but this book is just too long and exhausting and unpolished to do it justice.

B002KGKH5A|5.0|I'd become more interested in Jack White after seeing him in Let's Get Loud and observing amazed how he outclassed both The Edge (not hard to do) and Jimmy Page (Jimmy Page, man!!!). I was happy then to watch this personal documentary of the band playing both big venues as well as surprise venues (bowling alleys, a boat in Charlottetown, a flour mill in London, pool halls, etc), and even going so far as to announce a one-note show where they rolled in, blast one single chord, and left (to encore calls for \\"one more note\\" - Canadians may be boring, but they are known for their sense of humour).<br /><br />This is probably the world's first black and white AND red film, making it very Emily Strange throughout. For the footage done in the north, it is still daylight at 11:15 PM. Jack agonises over the criticism of the band's image-consciousness, noting how Spin wrote \\"The White Stripes are simultaneously the most fake band in the world and the most real band in the world. Everything about the White Stripes is a lie.\\" (Jack should probably be reassured that Jim Jarmusch finds them the real deal at least). When they are in Yellowknife the mayer picks them up from the airport and drives them in to town! Interesting to know that Meg and Jack bowl all over the world, and that Meg never talks and hardly sings. Meg does lead vocals on one song. Another song is synchronized with a 1930s film. They go to Iqaluit in Nanavut territory, many things are red and white, mud town, Rita guitar. They sing songs for the Inuit council, which Jarmusch notes is when they seem at their happiest and most engaged. Jack uses guitars that don't stay in tune, no set list, keyboard far away, these components force them to create. Plays in a kilt at one point.<br /><br />There's a touching scene of Meg weeping as Jack plays a guitar at the end. Very nice video.

B007VCMW9C|5.0|This album has gotten a great reissue treatment, with the five songs of the original EP, eight extra songs (live demos, basically), and several long essays in a booklet full of pictures.<br /><br />Starting off with that weird drum beat (with their pre-Steve Shelley drummer Richard Edson, making this the only album they do with this sound), the shivering guitars, and the galloping/limping rhythms, this is Sonic Youth as it was first ever hears on the SST original release. Yes, the drums are a bit jazzy, but it's all there in all its sqruonking glory. The first track is \\"The Burning Spear\\", a song that the band still plays, and the bass is heavy and groovy with a nice rhythm. We don't get any real noise until halfway through the 3:45 song, a bit before the vocals come in. \\"I'm not afraid to say I'm scared.\\" \\"I Dreamed I Dream\\" has nice tonal tones, a cool little moody thing, Kim sings this spookily with Lee doing some background vocals. \\"She Is Not Alone\\" is one of those really cool, rugged songs with the jungle rhythms and the strange guitars. Very cool indeed. \\"I Don't Want To Push It\\" scrubs and scrubs, with weird jungle rhythms, boogying busily on and on, much faster than the guitars; sounds pretty crazy, man, and a bit alarming for people who thought that the strange was normal - this is stranger than strange! \\"I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I... know.\\" Great crazy guitar noise and spidery innovation, with that crazy drumming the while while. YOIKS!!! \\"The Good And The Bad\\" ends the EP with some bass-led rhythms, discordant chords coming in, drone, that weird nearly-complete Sonic Youth sound is right there! THe longest song on the album, at over seven minutes, this is the one where they really stretch out and get going. Nice. Half of it is wanking around, and it is all instrumental.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! This is the expanded version, with eight new tracks, all of them live bits from September 18th 1981 that show the tracks coming together (the album was recorded December 1981 to January 1982). \\"Hard Work\\" is \\"I Don't Want To Push It\\" in instrumental, and \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\" is an early version of \\"I Dreamed I Dream\\", which we get herein both a live version and an early studio version... \\"Loud And Soft\\" is a nutty long noise fest, as are the rest - very little singing, quite a lot of instrumental stuff on the live tracks. All of the live songs are interesting, and they have that experimental chugging sound. Nice.<br /><br />The liner notes are great - we get pieces from all the members, as well as Glenn Branca; I'd say that the note from original drummer Richard Edson are definitely the most interesting, though, and Bryan Coley also has a long piece. Thurston just puts in something enigmatic (in blue ink!). Lots of pics of the band in 1981, looking very optimistic and youthful.

B004UFEJW6|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies and just had to have it on Blu-ray. This is a movie that you need to watch not just with your eyes, but with your heart.  The dialogue, or lack there-of, speaks volumes.  If you're looking for a Star Wars or Van Damme film, go buy those, because this is a much deeper story.  Kurt Russell was fantastic.  His facial expressions more than made up for the scarce dialogue.  He is a soldier, selected at birth and trained for war.  After 35 years or so, he and his teammates are replaced by &#34;better&#34; lab-created, chemically maintained, solders.  He knows nothing else, as this was his entire life.  Ultimately he is marooned on a planet where is finds and is welcomed by a small group of people that crash landed there.  He is forced out of the community, out of fear, but returns to their aid when the new soldiers accidentally show up while on a training mission. This is a story of two wars, one between the soldiers, and one for Kurt's humanity.

I was embarrassed and mortified when I was given the book back and informed I'd given them the 1997 edition, which is a blue book; instead of the 2009 edition, which is a yellow book.  You'd think the sellers would know the difference.<br /><br />I think it was a bait and switch job myself, and instead of the seller providing me with an RMA, and offer to ship me out the right book- they wanted me to pay to ship the book back.  It wasn't even worth the effort, as I'd burn up more gas than the damned book is worth.  Horrible sellers!  If could could've given them a zero and a few more expletives, I would have!

Mike doesn't muck around with trying to sell you a new fad. He provides clear data for you to take or leave. If you want to be fit, it takes hard work and determination and Mike provides you with the information to do it. The best thing is that Mike actually pops you an email and personally keeps in contact with you to check on your progress. The books are inexpensive and I recommend buying the lot. My husband and I loved Bigger, Leaner Stronger + Thinner, Leaner Stronger so much on e-book we had to buy the hard copy as well. Mike has his own website with excellent articles written by him and a great online presence through social media (instagram, pinterest etc)... The guy is lovely and a real fitness champion.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|For reference, I have downloaded and played this game on my Kindle Fire HD with no trouble. The game itself is very lovely graphics-wise and the sound and lightning create a rich and ominous atmosphere. While the puzzles were varied to a surprising degree, I would have liked to see increasing levels of difficulty as the game progressed and more use of the special viewing lens. Overall, it was an incredibly satisfying experience, but one that was way too short! I don't regret paying the $1.99 at all, considering that this is the developer's first game and it was far more engaging than any other puzzle app game I've played this year. I hope to see many more sequels and many more Rooms to come!

1468179993|4.0|I recieved an ARC from Netgalley.<br /><br />I will probably never give a TEDTalk but that doesn't mean that I won't have to give presentations in my profession. Just because I'm not delivering one of these inspirational talks doesn't mean that my presentations can't be creative and unique.<br /><br />This book is a great public speaking handbook.<br /><br />There are chapters that won't be applicable to everyone. For example How to Craft Your Catchphrase or How to be Introduced. The majority of these chapters can be used to create even the most basic presentation. The book focuses on telling a story instead of just reading facts and talking points.<br /><br />I think a good idea would be to head over to TED's website or YouTube page and watch some of the talks Jeremy Donovan discusses throughout the book. You could just read his account of Brene Brown's talk closing or you can go and watch the talk and get the full effect of her powerful closing.<br /><br />If you haven't taken a public speaking class in years, or just want a fresh perspective of delivering a presentation, you should check out this book. As Jeremy Donovan writes, \\"TED speakers craft compelling stories.\\" How to Deliver a TED Talk is a guide in turning your compelling story into an inspiring talk.

B0052REUW0|1.0|\\".... the advice of a farmer to increase a horse's efficiency by castrating it with two bricks. When asked, \\"Doesn't that hurt,\\" the farmer replies, \\"Not if you keep your thumbs out of the way.\\"\\"<br /><br />This is a marvelously detailed book with vast numbers of details about the decline of violence over the past centuries.  For someone who wants to try to understand  why violence occurs among humans, at any level from genocide to suicide, this volume is a phenomenal place to start.  The dozens and dozens of graphs themselves are worth the price of admission.  But, expect to be overwhelmed with detail, much of it very speculative and largely irrelevant, so overwhelmed  that no clear themes will ever become apparent.  You will leave this book vastly better informed but overloaded with information and utterly confused.  Pinker acknowledges his debt to Peter Singer, who in his book,\\" The Expanding Circle, advanced a theory of moral progress in which human beings were endowed by natural selection with a kernel of empathy toward kin and allies, and have gradually extended it to wider and wider circles of living things, from family and village to clan, tribe, nation, species, and all of sentient life. The book you are reading owes much to this insight.\\"  However this debt is largely lost in the mass of many irrelevant details that follow.<br /><br />After reflecting on the book for a while, as both a psychologist and a historian, and a student of genocide, I am both extremely impressed by the incredible depth of detail offered in this volume across a huge range of relevant domains, and quite annoyed at the absence of synthesis, as if he researched any topic to great depth but offered us only the results of that research in the order and sequence that he found them.  Of course that is an impressive feat, and I am very grateful, but...  Now that he has done this research, it would be quite pleasurable and transformative to read a much smaller volume that synthesized what he found in some accessible format; perhaps even in a magazine article.<br />Pinker spends much of his time deriding the notion of \\"empathy\\" and it is pretty obvious why:  it offers a simple and direct explanation for the decline of violence that reduces the complexity of his book enormously.  It would be hard for him to find a way for us to plow through his mountainous work of scholarship if things were this simple:  The world was ruled by psychopaths and sadists for millions of years, but gradually the silent majority of decent, caring people found a voice through democratizing and civilizing influences of empathy and compassion, overcoming xenophobia, selfishness, and revenge, and violence has declined dramatically with the gradually broadening sense of community in (increasing order)  villages, duchies, nations, and now global interdependence.  Outline of story with many wonderful details to be filled in, but requiring much less voluminous discussion.  Any theoretician needs to be aware of how seductive complexity is, and try to reduce it.  Occam's razor needs much sharpening here.<br /><br />To get another frustration off my chest, that constantly irritated me throughout the book:  it is much too flippant.  Take the quote above about a farmer castrating a horse.  Surely we did not need to be affronted by this horrible image.  What purpose did it possibly serve? It was not funny.  As if Pinker was reduced to a juvenile prurience himself after being anesthetized with too much violence in his research.  It seems part of the same issue: he provides flippant generalizations much too easily about many of the \\"facts\\" in this book, without the kind of reserve and care to provide alternative hypotheses that is the hallmark of careful science, at the admitted  cost of dullness and impartiality.  Even his criticism of empathy suffers from over generalization.  For empathy he puts up roadblocks that he nowhere else raises for other processes.  He portrays the understandingof empathy as ambiguous (\\"The problem with building a better world through empathy, in the sense of contagion, mimicry, vicarious emotion, or mirror neurons, is that it cannot be counted on to trigger the kind of empathy we want, namely sympathetic concern for others' well-being.\\") as if there were no ambiguity about what \\"civilizing\\" means!  He also shoots down \\"mirror neurons\\" as a strawman for empathy; yet, there is a vast literature on \\"empathy\\" that requires no help from the pop psych of mirror neurons, or the equally pop psych of \\"rage\\" circuits.  Pinker dabbles with neuroscience at best, and exploits its seemingly concrete explanations to a vast and unwarranted degree.<br />The most serious frustration with the volume is the discrepancy between its title and content:  the better Angels of our nature are largely ignored in favor of the devils: murder, suicide, rape, genocide, hatred, revenge, dominance, torture,  and aggression of all kinds.  The mystery of religion is barely acknowledged.  There is all too little talk of love, compassion, empathy,  and community; yet,  repeatedly he acknowledges these are equally important  and essential to the hypotheses he does raise about the decline of violence.  So, this book is really about violence, and not about the forces that restrain it and have created its decline.  In that sense, it is quite disappointing.  For instance, the discussion of dominance and revenge could just as easily have been about trust, forgiveness and contrition, especially in the section on the prisoner's dilemma, which has been used extensively for theorizing and extrapolating to real life cooperation and conflict.  Of course, there should be many caveats:  the simplistic domain of a prisoner's dilemma game is far removed from the complexities of real life.  Life is not so simple that we can begin to understand it with primitive abstractions!<br />Another theme that I found annoying was the insistence on a final solution of the issues of decline in violence with an appeal to evolutionary forces that are as ideal and free of imperfection as any deity; which of course evolution is not:  it leads to many blind alleys and dead ends (Mistakes!).  I find the arguments about genes and evolution as sources of explanation for human cognition and emotion very unsatisfying.  We have no understanding of how genes translate into human cognitive structures or emotions (or drives and instincts, to bring up some ancient and much ridiculed abstractions).  The psychology of instincts has few adherents.  Yes, genes control the structure of the brain, and various brain structures are involved in cognition and emotion, but the linkages to evolution are indistinct at best.  Our brains are intimately like those of apes and even all mammals in general.  To then argue that human  kinds of dominance and frustration and aggression have been created by evolution seems ultimately empty.  All too often evolutionary explanations are as ambiguous as Freudian ones:  the \\"facts\\" are not reductive and can be used to explain anything.<br />I find that Frans de Waal's ([[ASIN:0393073777 The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates]]) attempts to clarify the sources of empathy and social networks in the examples of these cognitive structures in chimpanzees much more enlightening.  Throughout his book, Pinker denigrates this approach to \\"hippy\\" instincts in humans as unfounded in a very off - handed way.  His book would have been much improved with a more serious treatment of forgiveness, empathy, caring, concern, and compassion;  that de Waal's approaches empirically provide.  Of course there are many other attempts to understand empathy through social psychology, neuroscience, and other social sciences.  While we have no serious understanding of how \\"instincts\\" and \\"emotions\\" are expressed in genes and cognitive structures, an analysis of the role of empathy, compassion, and social relations in general would have provided a seriously strong foundation for the democratization processes of civilization that have clearly driven the decline in violence.  It would have set the context for this decline in violence as the triumph of the huge \\"silent majority\\" of humanity over the thugs and antisocial ogres who have led humanity to their own selfish ends and at the cost of enormous anguish in the lives of mankind. \\"Psychopaths make up 1 to 3 percent of the male population, depending on whether one uses the broad definition of antisocial personality disorder, which embraces many kinds of callous troublemakers, or a narrower definition that picks out the more cunning manipulators. 80 Psychopaths are liars and bullies from the time they are children, show no capacity for sympathy or remorse, make up 20 to 30 percent of violent criminals, and commit half the serious crimes. 81.\\"<br /><br />\\"Now, I have nothing against empathy,\\"  he says.  The perfect sentence that reveals that he does in fact think that empathy's role in peace and cooperation is much exaggerated.  However, his reasoning about this is not very clear, while his attitudes are all too clear.  \\"But empathy today is becoming what love was in the 1960s-- a sentimental ideal, extolled in catchphrases (what makes the world go round, what the world needs now, all you need) but overrated as a reducer of violence.\\"  Calling the kettle black:  the number of catch phrases  about the sources of violence in this book is astronomical.<br />Instead of compiling empirical evidence, here is his \\"devastating\\" destruction of any believability in empathy: \\"When the Americans and Soviets stopped rattling nuclear sabers and stoking proxy wars, I don't think love had much to do with it, or empathy either.\\"  And yet, has he changed his mind when he says: \\"This chapter is about the better angels of our nature: the psychological faculties that steer us away from violence, and whose increased engagement over time can be credited for declines in violence. \\"  Thorughout the book he argues for subtle but persistent influences of human attitudes and emotions on the grand sweep of history; yet, when it comes to empathy he derides this nuanced approach.<br />He seems to devalue empathy because he can find no center for empathy in the neuroscience literature, and the richest areas of mirror neurons does not correspond to the pathways.  He further denigrates the value of the concept (or deconstructs it, in his unimitable semantic phrase) because it is connected to a primitive hormone, oxytocin, not the pinnacle of humanity's cortex (he derogates it with \\"hormonal plumbing\\", an unfortunate phrase. )  This seems a short sighted reason.<br />AT another point he says that sympathy  (a kind of empathy) is not automatic, as if that weakens its effects.  But of course sympathy is automatic, and beyond our control, if the conditions are right:  if we have communal relations with a person; if they are in need; and if it will make us look good to help them.  This is true of any drive, instinct, or emotion; so why he emphasizes if for empathy and not for dominance or revenge or other \\"angels\\", which are all affected by context and meaning (or cortical control, to capture his biases),  is a mystery.<br />Part of the book's appeal, and its underlying weakness, is his fondness for  grandiose and sweeping generalizations that are largely unfound and poorly thought out.  Here's just one:  \\"Dominance is an adaptation to anarchy, and it serves no purpose in a society that has undergone a civilizing process or in an international system regulated by agreements and norms. Anything that deflates the concept of dominance is likely to drive down the frequency of fights between individuals and wars between groups. That doesn't mean that the emotions behind dominance will go away-- they are very much a part of our biology, especially in a certain gender-- but they can be marginalized.\\"<br />In contradiction to this view, a good case can be madefor hierarchies in social institutions as control structures for violence to reduce its spread throughout society: one of the truly civilizing influences.  Besides, what would our societies look like without hierarchies in our social institutions.  They are built on them:  the Prez in govt; the Pope in religious institutions; CEOs in business;  down to the lowest scout troop leader.  If anything these hierarchies reduce conflict, not foment it.  As any ethologist will tell you, a chimp troop with a clear established hierarchy has many fewer fights then one in which a challenger upends the natural order.<br />So what is to be made of all these inconsistencies:  I suggest they are the product of a very creative but uncontrolled mind, an unscientific one that has had its brilliant ideas go unchallenged and is unconstrained by scientific rigor and skepticism.  Self criticism, autocritique as Binet called it, is the cornerstone of intelligence, and the free flow of random ideas makes for interesting reading but a frustrating intellectual experience.  More synthesis, please.<br />One good piece of synthesis is his conceptualization of the  Moralization Gap.  People consider the harms they inflict to be justified and forgettable, and the harms they suffer to be unprovoked and grievous. This bookkeeping makes the two sides in an escalating fight count the number of strikes differently and weigh the inflicted harm differently as well.  It makes people hold grudges and seek revenge.  It would have been informative to try to explore the source of this gap:  why do we do this?  Of course the basis for the generalization is derived from just one excellent study that has a fundamental ambiguity:  the gap is caused by discrepancies in understanding; yet the incidents by both victims and perpetrators were chosen exactly because they each saw no discrepanc ies.  What incidents would have been chosen if they had been asked to relate narratives where both victim and perpetrators had become aware of the discrepancies in perspectives:  would they have reconciled and apologized?  would there have been no anger?  There is a long history of cognitive consistency, famously carried by Leon Festinger as a salient proponent, and historically begun by Bartlett's memory task, that could be invoked to help explain this phenomenon, but is not (neither by Pinker nor his source, Baumeister.)  Widespread semantic frames ( which Pinker should be very familiar with)  that are different for \\"victim\\" and \\"perpetrator\\" could already hold the major features of these stories, as they are selected from memory or stored for future use.  Even empathy and its limitations could be invoked to help understand this \\"moralization gap\\" if it indeed exists.<br /><br />Empathy, like love, he argues is not all you need.  True enough, but then he seems to reduce its effects too much from the mix of what is necessary.  That seems too extreme.<br />Pinker spends a lot of effort on self control, but it should be mentioned that the science of self control is barely a science, and the assessment of self-control is fraught with difficulties, hardly the stable trait he makes it out to be.  The measurement of self control is haphazard and unreliable.  The very low correlation with intelligence  at 0.23 is as much a reflection on the low reliability of measurement of self control as it is on the relationship.  On the other hand intelligence is the most thoroughly studied human trait in psychology, with absolutely the best measures.  Instead of wasting abstractions on self control, it would have been much more productive to focus on intelligence, and not just the Flynn Effect.  Instead we are given essays on reason, which may or may not have much to do with intelligence and knowledge.  While intelligence probably has not changed much in the past millennia, its application has, and the amount of knowledge and understanding about the world has multiplied immeasurably.  This increased understanding of our place in the world might have had an effect way beyond anything that self control could possible effect.  Slovenly food and personal  habits that have been improved for health reasons also have raised the value of life and longevity, and so increa sed our compassion and empathy.  We don't believe in witches any more;  there are fewer ignorances that lead to xenophobia; we understand each other better;  here are many more opportunities for empathy and forgiveness.  He then draws out a long chain of speculative links between self control and violence, any one of which has minimal correlational support.  This may be an exercise in empirical futility.  The link between intelligence and violence  is much more direct and manifold.  Of course, his final section on reason is really about intelligence, although for some reason he is loathe to use this time honored and important word.<br />I find his reification of a \\"moral sense\\"  to be overdone.  While there may be many psychological processes that contribute to moral judgments, it is a stretch to unify them into anything as concrete as a \\"moral sense\\".  Of course, the same critique could apply to any of his  \\"angels\\".  These  are all conceptual structures with varying degrees of coherence and consistency.  However, the analysis of this moral sense into relational models of community, dominance, and fairness suggests it could have been much more foundational in the analysis of the civilizing process than Pinker makes it out to be.  The analysis does not provide a level of detail that makes it possible  to connect empathy with this moral sense in a  review, yet many connections seem apparent.<br />The summary section on religion is also a bit mystifying.  \\"Speaking of ideologies, we have seen that little good has come from ancient tribal dogmas. All over the world, belief in the supernatural has authorized the sacrifice of people to propitiate bloodthirsty gods, and the murder of witches for their malevolent power.\\"  While this may be true to an extent in the blood thirsty past, it is an extreme exaggeration to say that little good has come of it.  It is undeniable that recent religious activities help the poor and starving masses in the world; and deal effectively with the aftermath of genocides.  The mystery of religion and its role in the world is as impenetrable as ever.  Perhaps his elevation of the importance of reason prevents him from a fair assessment of religion, as much as it does of empathy.<br />The next summary section on \\"Gentle Commerce\\" raises many hackles as well in this era of the 1% dominating financial benefits and government, exploiting their intelligence and social networks to inflict countless harm on the 99%.  Violence has come to have a different face today, but its effects are just as inimical.<br />Probably no section is as effective a support of the power of empathy as the section on Feminization.  If all the rational forces of peace  are so powerful, how can this section's devastating analysis of the disruptive and violent power of young males hold?<br />But finally, once again, the truth of so many theses in this book are undeniable, none more so than the overriding importance of the decline of violence in the improvement of human lives:  \\"The decline of violence may be the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species. Its implications touch the core of our beliefs and values-- for what could be more fundamental than an understanding of whether the human condition, over the course of its history, has gotten steadily better, steadily worse, or has not changed?\\"<br />His closing comment  is worth repeating: \\"For all the tribulations in our lives, for all the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible.\\"  Those forces of sympathy and compassion, with the intellect to make them triumph,  are alive within us today.<br />Overall, this is a magnificent resource, but to be provocative I have given it a one-star rating to emphasize how poorly it has synthesized the vast literature it has so scholarly compiled.<br /><br />In fact, Pinker has written a shorter article in October 2011 in Nature:  [...]<br />whose heading is  (more appropriately than the subhead of the book): Taming the Devil Within Us.  Rather than providing a trenchant summary of the book, it wanders along the same channels and muddles to a conclusion about reason and the Flynn Effect that seems as unsatisfying as the book.  It says that we are getting smarter, and as a result the world is becoming more peaceful.  In it he rightfully acknowledges \\"empathy\\" as the most famous \\"better angel\\" source of this decline in violence, but once again says it is not enough.  Similarly he debunks the \\"moral sense\\"  as creating more violence than inhibiting it.  Instead he agrees with Peter Singer (without ever referencing him in the article!): \\"The most important psychological con- tributor to the decline of violence over the  long term may instead be reason: the cognitive faculties, honed by the exchange of ideas  through language, that allow us to understand  the world and negotiate social arrangements.\\"  I would say they are equally important, but cannot disagree with him on the importance of our intellect.<br />I have no idea why he later throws in this seemingly self-conradictory comment about contradicting Hume:  \\"Reason can also lead people to want less  violence. This may seem to violate Scottish philosopher David Hume's dictum that  \\"reason is, and ought to be, only the slave of  the passions\\" . Reason, by itself, can lay out  a road map to peace or to war, to tolerance  or to persecution, depending on what the  reasoner wants.\\"  Personally, I think his arguments about reason, by itself, without a basis in empathy, reducing violence are very weak.  It stems largely from one meta-study of SAT scores and the Prisoner's Dilemma experiment,  that is fundamentally flawed.  In any event, in the only world we know, it is clear that empathy, as Hume held, is the driving force for the intellectual creation of institutions of peace and harmony.<br />He then quotes from the final chapters of his book: \\"They prefer  to live rather than die, keep their body parts  intact and spend their days in comfort rather  than in pain. Logic does not force them to have those prejudices. Yet any product of natural selection -- indeed, any agent that has endured the ravages of entropy long  enough to be reasoning in the first place --  is likely to have them.\\"  As Spock would say, it is so logical!, but any scientist knows that logic is not enough to be convincing about empirical truth.<br />He then goes on to give a quick and somewhat mis-informed snapshot about the Flynn Effect, and concludes that we are getting smarter, and so with a paean to a glorious future, proclaims that these improvements in our conceptions of humanitarian sympathies are all a bright product of reason, which, with some hiccups, will lead us into an ever better future.  While I am as optimistic as he is, I still agree with Hume, and perhaps so does Pinker in a nagging way, understand that this explanation is not quite logical.for hierarchies in social institutions as control structures for violence to reduce its spread throughout society: one of the truly civilizing influences.  Besides, what would our societies look like without hierarchies in our social institutions.  They are built on them:  the Prez in govt; the Pope in religious institutions; CEOs in business;  down to the lowest scout troop leader.  If anything these hierarchies reduce conflict, not foment it.  As any ethologist will tell you, a chimp troop with a clear established hierarchy has many fewer fights then one in which a challenger upends the natural order.<br />So what is to be made of all these inconsistencies:  I suggest they are the product of a very creative but uncontrolled mind, an unscientific one that has had its brilliant ideas go unchallenged and is unconstrained by scientific rigor and skepticism.  Self criticism, autocritique as Binet called it, is the cornerstone of intelligence, and the free flow of random ideas makes for interesting reading but a frustrating intellectual experience.  More synthesis, please.<br />One good piece of synthesis is his conceptualization of the  Moralization Gap.  People consider the harms they inflict to be justified and forgettable, and the harms they suffer to be unprovoked and grievous. This bookkeeping makes the two sides in an escalating fight count the number of strikes differently and weigh the inflicted harm differently as well.  It makes people hold grudges and seek revenge.  It would have been informative to try to explore the source of this gap:  why do we do this?  Of course the basis for the generalization is derived from just one excellent study that has a fundamental ambiguity:  the gap is caused by discrepancies in understanding; yet the incidents by both victims and perpetrators were chosen exactly because they each saw no discrepanc ies.  What incidents would have been chosen if they had been asked to relate narratives where both victim and perpetrators had become aware of the discrepancies in perspectives:  would they have reconciled and apologized?  would there have been no anger?  There is a long history of cognitive consistency, famously carried by Leon Festinger as a salient proponent, and historically begun by Bartlett's memory task, that could be invoked to help explain this phenomenon, but is not (neither by Pinker nor his source, Baumeister.)  Widespread semantic frames ( which Pinker should be very familiar with)  that are different for \\"victim\\" and \\"perpetrator\\" could already hold the major features of these stories, as they are selected from memory or stored for future use.  Even empathy and its limitations could be invoked to help understand this \\"moralization gap\\" if it indeed exists.<br /><br />Empathy, like love, he argues is not all you need.  True enough, but then he seems to reduce its effects too much from the mix of what is necessary.  That seems too extreme.<br />Pinker spends a lot of effort on self control, but it should be mentioned that the science of self control is barely a science, and the assessment of self-control is fraught with difficulties, hardly the stable trait he makes it out to be.  The measurement of self control is haphazard and unreliable.  The very low correlation with intelligence  at 0.23 is as much a reflection on the low reliability of measurement of self control as it is on the relationship.  On the other hand intelligence is the most thoroughly studied human trait in psychology, with absolutely the best measures.  Instead of wasting abstractions on self control, it would have been much more productive to focus on intelligence, and not just the Flynn Effect.  Instead we are given essays on reason, which may or may not have much to do with intelligence and knowledge.  While intelligence probably has not changed much in the past millennia, its application has, and the amount of knowledge and understanding about the world has multiplied immeasurably.  This increased understanding of our place in the world might have had an effect way beyond anything that self control could possible effect.  Slovenly food and personal  habits that have been improved for health reasons also have raised the value of life and longevity, and so increa sed our compassion and empathy.  We don't believe in witches any more;  there are fewer ignorances that lead to xenophobia; we understand each other better;  here are many more opportunities for empathy and forgiveness.  He then draws out a long chain of speculative links between self control and violence, any one of which has minimal correlational support.  This may be an exercise in empirical futility.  The link between intelligence and violence  is much more direct and manifold.  Of course, his final section on reason is really about intelligence, although for some reason he is loathe to use this time honored and important word.<br />I find his reification of a \\"moral sense\\"  to be overdone.  While there may be many psychological processes that contribute to moral judgments, it is a stretch to unify them into anything as concrete as a \\"moral sense\\".  Of course, the same critique could apply to any of his  \\"angels\\".  These  are all conceptual structures with varying degrees of coherence and consistency.  However, the analysis of this moral sense into relational models of community, dominance, and fairness suggests it could have been much more foundational in the analysis of the civilizing process than Pinker makes it out to be.  The analysis does not provide a level of detail that makes it possible  to connect empathy with this moral sense in a  review, yet many connections seem apparent.<br />The summary section on religion is also a bit mystifying.  \\"Speaking of ideologies, we have seen that little good has come from ancient tribal dogmas. All over the world, belief in the supernatural has authorized the sacrifice of people to propitiate bloodthirsty gods, and the murder of witches for their malevolent power.\\"  While this may be true to an extent in the blood thirsty past, it is an extreme exaggeration to say that little good has come of it.  It is undeniable that recent religious activities help the poor and starving masses in the world; and deal effectively with the aftermath of genocides.  The mystery of religion and its role in the world is as impenetrable as ever.  Perhaps his elevation of the importance of reason prevents him from a fair assessment of religion, as much as it does of empathy.<br />The next summary section on \\"Gentle Commerce\\" raises many hackles as well in this era of the 1% dominating financial benefits and government, exploiting their intelligence and social networks to inflict countless harm on the 99%.  Violence has come to have a different face today, but its effects are just as inimical.<br />Probably no section is as effective a support of the power of empathy as the section on Feminization.

B00AYR2FOI|3.0|As much as I love Boz Scaags I wish he would've done more songs that I recognized and like.  I did enjoy his versions of  the classics &#34;Love on a Two Way Street&#34; and &#34;Can I Change My Mind&#34;.  The bluesy songs he included towards the end of the CD were also pretty good.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love it. I look at it all the time. It's better than looking at the battery.For the price I could not go wrong.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I agree with what is said here.  This is one of the best Metheny albums.  One which stood the test of time.  It's pop music, so be warned (it's not jazz).  But it's excellent stuff.
B007TR1R1I|5.0|This is a great movie but is not for everybody. It has a great cast and is based of a book/play.

B009AMAGQM|3.0|After a month of watching previews for this movie, I finally went to the theaters and saw it when it came out.  The previews were great, and I was not disappointed when I saw the movie.  The characters were good, although I thought there could have been more depth to them.  The plot was good and the movie was easy for me to follow, even the flashbacks were easy to understand (well, once the whole scene was played).  And the digital effects whenever magic was involved was amazing.  But I liked the movie so much I got the book.  And then I liked the movie a lot less.  To me, it was like the movie shared the main character's names with a lot of side character that were important cut out, a little bit of their personalities, and roughly the same plot as the book.  But the movie left out too many details, changed too much of the story to save time explaining things.  I understand that many parts of a book have to be cut out to make the movie a reasonable time, but they cut out the wrong things and added bad details.  With all that said, I like the movie and I love the book, but I pretend they just share similar things instead of being the same story.

B008602KQI|4.0|This movie really makes you think.  What if we lived in a world like that. The emotions that you feel in the beginning of the movie are similar to the emotions you feel before the end of the game.  Humans can be human, we don't have to kill each other.  I think this movie is really well acted, but if you want full on action this is not your movie.  Well directed, well acted, worth seeing. H U N G E R.

B00C5XBAOA|2.0|I ran out and purchased this set for my 3 year old daughter who is in love with the show.  What a mistake, as the other reviewer said Sophia & Amber\\"s heads constantly pop off.  Which makes playing with them pretty frustrating for my child . Also the only character who is actually able to stand on its own is Queen Miranda the others just topple over. We will be returning these today.
B00198X0VS|4.0|I viewed the first one many years ago and liked it. Recently I watched the third one and decided to get the second one to watch and enjoyed. These are the movies will never get an Oscar award, but do entertain you greatly. Highly recommend you to watch if you like the No. 3 too.

B009PDO946|5.0|For a music lover, a classic music lover, this blu-ray disc is perfect in both images and music if you have a 8 channel sound system as mine with a 70 inch TV to watch in a real family media room. I do not know whether it worth to buy if your equipments would not reproduce the high quality music and images to enjoy.<br /><br />For the few have better equipment than mine, if you like classic music, go to buy it and enjoy it and it will not disappoint you.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Super fun. Wish that I could play it on my iPod generation 1. I personally think that this app has changed my life.
B001FW58D6|5.0|Not a big Sci-fi series fan, but Fringe will always be a favorite of mine.<br /><br />What made it for me was the relationship between characters: the father and son dynamic of the Bishops, Olivia's need to save everyone, Astrid's nurturing presence. All these relationships grow through the 5 seasons.<br /><br />The plot and science was second to the characters for me. You have to suspend your belief a lot, after all this is mostly based on psuedoscience, but that's what makes it so much fun.<br /><br />I liked this show so much more than Lost. I was angry with the way Lost ended in that I felt viewers were strung along for 6 years with an unsatisfactory ending and many loose ends, the equivalent of \\"I woke up and it was all a dream.\\" This time around, I felt the writers did their best creating a complete story arc that wrapped up in the finale (which was rushed due to the show's cancellation). Yes, there's deus ex machina and leaps of faith required, but that's the kind of show it is. If you are willing to let go of that a little and embrace the fantasy part and like to root for the good guys, I think you'll enjoy this series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|to keep it short: perfection.<br />Nothing else I can really say, I just can't put into words how I feel about this book.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|I think the actors did the best they could. But the plot... was just terrible. Unbelievable and not in a good way. It was actually funny in area's it shouldn't be because the story line was so ridiculous. I only finished this movie because it was so bad it was funny. It's basically a story about the leads not having the faintest idea how to stand up for themselves or ask for what they want. BOTH of them. I mean they were sweet and I liked them at first... but seriously. Ginnifer's character betrays her best friend by sleeping with her fiancee. Then instead of somebody coming clean Kate's character's eventually confesses to Ginnifer that she cheated on her fiancee and Kate & said fiancee eventually break up. On the same day just after the breakup Kate's character figures out her best friend and former fiancee were screwing around behind her back. That's a hard plot to sell in the first place & they didn't do themselves any favors by not giving the lead character's any sort of redeeming qualities (being too nice, having no backbone, and wanting to make everyone else happy at your own expense is not a redeeming quality) since no body fessed up until it was glaringly obvious. The fact that the leads loved each other first does not make it ok. The fact that Kate's character had cheated too didn't make it ok either. I rooted for her & Ginnifer's best guy friend more than the leads. At least Kate's character had the guts to be herself & not hide behind anyone else. And the other crap they threw in there to make the story more lovable JUST didn't work (the ploy of Ginnifer's best friend to pretend to be gay to get away from some stalker like girl). That was even worse.<br /><br />Thank goodness it was only $1.99 although I say that was too much. This should be free. I don't recommend it.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Oh my.<br />I bought this on a whim, running out of money on my Amazon gift card (and I know youv'e had the same experience!). I had already bought 2 tracks by themselves (Viva la Vida and Strawberry swing) and have been an avid fan of Coldplay ever since my friend introduced it to me on a seventh grade field trip to Natural Bridge, VA. So, anyway, I bought the CD, and it came just in time for a Chorus field trip to Kings Dominion. Before I went to bed, I cuddled up with my cat and listened to the CD all the way through. I was BLOWN AWAY.<br />My cat stayed with me through the sweet, aptly named Life in Technicolour, the dark yet beautiful Cemeteries of London, and Lost! a song which rocketed to my favorite with the first organ chord.<br />With 42, my cat and I sat in stunned silence, listening to the quiet, peaceful day gradually turn into a storm of instruments and feeling, then calm back down, recreating the feeling of peace, but slightly different, as if the calm, quiet day has turned into night.<br />The bright, perky intro of Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love caught us off guard, but also captured our hearts. As the busy pianist began to slow down, it was almost as if our world had slowed down as well. Why the two songs were associated as one, I do not know, but they complement each other nicely. I almost had tears in my eyes when the song ended.<br />Soon after, Yes began. The song was not my favorite on the CD, though I can appreciate the talent of all those who made it possible. The violin was my favorite part of the whole song.<br />Next was Viva La Vida, one of my personal favorites. I had heard the song several times before, but when it played this time, I closed my eyes and remembered how I felt the first time I heard it.<br />I was stuck on a crowded, noisy bus on my way to the Natural Bridge. My friend had brought her Nook, which apparently stores music (I don't know. You learn something new every day.). She was about to FORCE me to listen to Viva La Vida, which I had thought was a mariachi song, or something else that I would hate. The bus was stuck in a traffic jam right on a bridge  overlooking the most beautiful day I've ever seen. As the violins started, all doubt left my mind. This song was completely amazing. This day was completely amazing. This life was completely amazing. I guess you could say that one Coldplay song changed my outlook on life forever. I looked out on the fog covering the lower branches of the millions of pine trees that stretched out as far as I could see. I never wanted that moment to end.<br />As I opened my eyes, I saw my cat asleep on my rotating chair. \\"Even though some moments cannot be recreated,\\" I thought, \\"I can still make the best of everything.\\" I reached out to pet my cat, who promptly bit me on the hand.<br />I cradled my hand, moaning in pain as Viva La Vida drew to a close, and Violet Hill began. The song really made me feel the emotions of the singer. The lyrics \\"If you love me, won't you let me know\\" still roam my head, playing their melody whenever I stand in silence.<br />Strawberry Swing was the next song on the CD. I had heard it before, and never really liked it until my friend, the same friend who introduced me to Coldplay in the first place, showed me the music video. Being an artistic person myself, I could really appreciate all the creativity and effort that MUST have gone into making that video. (If you have not seen the video for Strawberry Swing, do yourself a favor and look it up IMMEDIATELY.)<br />The final song, Death and all His Friends, reminded me of a demented lullaby at first. But as the guitars and other instruments kicked in, I was mesmerized. The quote \\"No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end, I don't want to cycle and recycle revenge, I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends\\" is now one that I put all over my personal belongings. Some people write their initials on their things, I write Coldplay quotes. Everyone's special.<br />As the music faded I awoke my cat, getting ready to stop the CD. Then something happened. I heard the start of Life in Technicolour, and at first I thought the CD had started over. Then I remembered that my CD player WAS NOT ABLE to do that. I was freaking out. Then I heard someone singing, and remembered that Life in Technicolour had virtually no lyrics (Unless you count \\"Ohhhh\\" as a lyric) I the realized that I had found the \\"bonus track\\". I forgot the title. ...Nope, still don't remember. Oh well. It was still good.<br />When the CD ended for real, I immediately started it over. It was at this point that my cat bailed. Apparently, he likes music, but not that much! :)<br />So for anyone reading this review (and to anyone who stuck with me and read this WHOLE THING!!) I would recommend this CD to ANYONE IN THE WORLD!!!!!! (Not kidding!)<br />Twas good.<br />Twas VERY good.<br />And my cat agrees.<br />~Courtney.s the music faded I awoke my cat, getting ready to stop the CD. Then something happened.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|This whacky story is delightfully told in very quirky style. The almost slapstick comedy of it is delivered with a dry humour which I found particularly enjoyable. Although aspects of the story are entirely unbelievable, they are presented with such convincing detail that you can almost believe them. A very good read.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is the second of Hosseini's books that I've read, after the Kite Runner. Although I enjoyed the latter, I find this one has greatly more depth and is told with such humanity that you feel the author has personal experience of every aspect of the story. I love the way all the major players in the story have their chapters, so that you explore each part in depth at different times, putting the whole , vast picture together gradually. A book of huge breadth and great sensitivity.
B008RKKUZ0|4.0|i like the movie and enjoyed watching it in hd. Would recommend it to anyone that likes goofy movies with weird caracters and plots
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi is my daughters favorite singer and thinks all of her music just keeps getting better. She plays piano so she is trying to learn the song on piano.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles were fun. I really enjoyed the background music too. I cannot wait for an update. The best thing is....it is free!
B005LMEB8E|5.0|The album has the perfect balance music. Demi has a great voice and I am definitely going to buy her next album when it comes out.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Well I like this game because I like sharks but you get to be the shark and know what it feels to be a shark you should get it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice setup, clean format, easy and fun! I think it's very well done for being a free game. If you like solitaire, this is for you.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I think Harris left too many loose ends for this to be the final book.  I didn't like who Sookie<br /> ended up with either.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Accidently ran across this movie had no idea what it was, but after watching it I had to buy a copy. Action, drama, and Jean Reno. What a great movie!
B007KT6864|5.0|Leonard Cohen speaks to me, in his transparent poems and those beautifully metaphorical......playful, humorous and deadly serious ones. I first encountered LC at 60 and at 86, I am still very fulfilled.....my sister at 90 was dancing to his &#34;closing time&#34;.....but, there were no polka dots.
0800141660|5.0|one of my all time favorites! loaned my original copy to a friend and she loved it so much I had to let her keep it and buy a new copy.
0345455681|5.0|I now have all of Edward Rutherford Novels Dublin &#60;the awakening of Ireland&#62;  Rebels of Ireland Princes of Ireland<br />NewYork. and these three that I have just received I find that all of his novels have the storyline of different families and<br />so much of true facts I find that I am learning a lot of Historical Facts that I have never known before and the story of<br />the diferent Families and following their lives makes the books so much easier to read. I think that he is the best  writer I have<br />been lucky enouough to discover.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|So well written...I couldn't put it down. The characters were interesting and authentic and I found myself caught up in the story line as this wonderful book called me back.
B008IYR2BA|1.0|as an avid dexter fan, i absolutely hated season 6 of dexter. the 'big bad' combo of colin hanks/edward olmos bored me to tears. what's more, tonally, the season did not feel like the dexter show anymore. i know the original head writer left after season 4 (trinity), but season 5, though different, still felt like the show i know and love. season 6 was full of incessant needless scenes that were totally boring. i don't know how they could have improved it-- it just felt incomplete and uninteresting. the only part of season 6 that was good was the last scene of the finale-- but by then, you have to wait almost an entire year to see the next season.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I would rate this book more than five stars, if I could. I have always believed,intuitively, that body-weeight exercises are best. This book provides evidence. Cancel your gym membership, do the exercises in the book. You may not become a Navy Seal, but you will be very fit.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|If Simon Singh had been my professor, I would have been a Mathmatician or a Cryptographer. Such is his writing style and story telling ability that you are drawn in to the world of secret writing and educated on the how and why of cryptography throughout human history. You learn about simple ciphers to complex mechanisms for generating coded messages. You learn what works best, what is easily defeated and how it all ties together to make our daily internet interactions secure and safe.<br /><br />There is so much packed into this book that I was surprised and struck by how well the author told it all in such a small space. If you want to learn about cryptography, this is the book to start with. If you like spy-novels, this is several packed into one, and if you love tales of unsung heroes who saved the world, this is your book. I have bought copies of this for several friends and family members, it is that good.
0375507256|2.0|I'm not going to give a synopsis of the book, others have done that already.  I find it hard to believe that this simplistic work was a Man Booker Prize finalist, but perhaps that is because it has all the right politics in place-which were so distracting to me, it made me dislike the book as a whole. I quite enjoyed the second chapter-R.F. was an entertaining rouge, not a preachy goody goody like Ms Rey is in a later chapter. He came down in his re-incarnation. (I'm not giving that away-it will be very obvious pretty fast) My complaint about the book is-first and foremost, he is not that great of a writer, he is no Michael Chabon that's for sure. Second-I don't like his insertion of his own politics into the work.Let me rephrase that-I don't like the clunky, obvious way he inserts his politics into the work.  I felt, at times, that I was reading the talking points from a MSNBC guest. My first \\"uh oh, one of these\\" was when he has a character say The Washington Post is where \\"democracies conduct their civil wars,\\" in a diatribe about the media being \\"bought\\" by politicians.  I almost spit out my coffee, because the Washington Post has been the \\"cover\\" for countless Democratic politicians for decades. The very next paragraph has the character (an activist) telling the \\"reporter\\" (who we later learn is a liberal), that she can write a story about the activists as long as she doesn't \\"write a satire about GreenFront new Waldenites in their mini Woodstock so as to confirm every Republican Party prejudice and bury truth a little deeper.\\"  Sigh.  I knew I was in for a long read.<br /><br />  I did finish the book.  I won't go into all the other left leaning themes, but they are on practically every 3rd page or so.  Sloosha's crossin an ev'rythin after is practically unreadable, which is a shame, because it was practically politics free.  Sonmi made a few keen observations I thought-one being that \\"trouble attracts blame; blame demands a scapegoat.\\" If the writer could have stuck with these occasional (very occasional)insights into human nature, the book may have been good.  Instead, he goes down so many well tread roads, I felt like I heard all of this before.  The author was born in England and lives in Ireland.  I'm assuming among all white people pretty much, because he rendered every \\"person of color\\" in the book as basically an angel or a hero. (except for Asians.  It seems he despises them almost as much as white people) All the \\"bad\\" people in the book are one-dimensional white people, and a few Asians.  He seems to think the world would be better if black or brown people were in charge.  Me thinks he is not familiar with the United States, or used to seeing black people with any kind of power like you have in the states.  He talks, on the last page, of \\"people of color\\" being crucified, and white people being crucified who stand up for the poor people of color.  Well, David Mitchell-you have shown the opposite to be true-you crucified white people to death in your novel, and almost got a Booker Prize, you've had praise from almost every corner, and you even got a movie deal out of it.  I don't call that being crucified.
B002WY65VU|4.0|What's not to love. It's a Zombie movie with Woody Harrelson as a deranged red-neck Zombie Killer and Jesse Eisenberg as a reluctant hero who survived the Apocalypse because he was a shut-in.<br /><br />The intro to the movie sets the stage nicely, giving you an understanding of what happened and letting you in on a few key rules of survival. I kind of wish those rules had continued to feature prominently, since the intro gave us a good half-dozen or so to chew over and laugh at. I felt those tied the story back nicely to the two schools of though being portrayed by Harrelson and Eisenberg, namely a careful/all-or-nothing approach.<br /><br />The Zombies are B-movie grade and terribly made-up. I think Shaun of the Dead had better Zombie effects honestly, but about halfway through the story you begin to realize the Zombies of &#34;Zombieland&#34; are scenery and not there to engender fears of peril for the heroes. That's too bad because sometimes a good comedy that mocks an entertainment trend does so by going above and beyond other movies.<br /><br />So why the 4 Stars, well Zombieland still has some great moments that need to be remembered for future hardcore Zombie flicks. These are scenes that should be emulated to add levity to a dire situation. From a banjo call to the mistaken Zombie Bill Murray, these are great and really made the movie for me. Also having the search for a Twinkie made me realize how few Zombie movies remember that eventually the things that remind us of the old world will disappear completely and the search for those things can drive characters in interesting and enjoyable ways.<br /><br />I watch this proudly along side other Zombie flicks, and I think it is worth the gander if you're interested.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Super easy to use. Greatly improves sounds quality and allows for on-the-fly audio changes and corrections. Perfect for what I need.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, it's very interesting and fun. I spend lots of my time in this game game and you never get bored because they always got new things.
B009R659L8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it kept me guessing until the last chapter. Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite author. I have been reading her for several years.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I didn't read the book although I saw an original copy at The Pratt Library in Baltimore. I remember this version of Gatsby because it got a lot of press, sort of like Gone with the wind. Gentlemen's Quarterly did a big story on Robert Redford and his Gatsby wardrobe. Coppola captured the feel of the Jazz Age with the characters, the music, and the scenery. I haven't seen the latest Gatsby but somehow I can't see DeCaprio as Gatsby and I can't imagine Jay Zee's hip hop music replacing the great music of the jazz age. I expect Baz Luhrmann was trying to reach a younger audience but in so doing I think he did a great injustice to Fitzgerald's work.
B000HZD168|5.0|Perfect audio and video clarity.  It is a very convenient way to view what has become a classic Star Trek film.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It guessed obscure characters! Family loves it, friends love it! We all have a great time playing Akinator! Get it!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Amazing album.  1000 Suns was one of the best albums, and Living Things is a great addition to their lineup.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|I became an instant fan of TesseracT the minute I heard 'One.' I didn't know what to expect next, especially after the multiple changes in lineup -- then I started it up, listened, and after it was over, I picked my jaw up off the floor and was instantly hooked. 'Altered State' is simply a brilliant album. Some albums are just music. This is art.<br /><br />What are you waiting for? Go listen to it!
B004EPZ070|5.0|I wish this movie had been made many years ago.  I think it gives so much for everyone to enjoy.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, and that's coming from a die hard Hemingway enthusiast. The Kindle version is great, it even has the original drawings from the print version of this book.
