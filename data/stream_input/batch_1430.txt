0321701763|5.0|Needed this for a graphic design class and since I already had the program, this is all I needed.<br />It's around $60 in a store so this is a great option for someone on a budget.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Easy-to-use instructions.<br />- Pictures, demonstrations, examples, index and clarifications.<br />- Includes a CD tutorial with the lessons.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- It came wrapped in a thick rubber band to keep the CD from slipping out<br />but at the same time, it bent the book out of shape though that's not a real issue.<br /><br />WARNING: this is a book to teach you to use Adobe Photoshop CS5,<br />it does NOT include a copy of the program.<br />You have to have the program already, this is NOT the program.<br /><br />FINAL RATING: 5/5
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When the book was first recommended to me, it was as \\"Twilight for adults.\\" Come to find out, this IS Twilight fanfiction, but with a few facts and names changed.  Knowing that makes most of the details make much more sense-- most of the plot only makes sense if Christian Grey is, in fact, a vampire who just wants to drink protagonist (NOT heroine) Ana's blood.<br /><br />The writing is poor, the characters are weak and one-dimensional, and the plot either plods along or surges. This is self-publishing (and the viral Internet) at its worst. The same descriptions are used ad nauseum, and the protagonist has an annoying \\"inner goddess\\" who she has conversations with. She's a stereotypically insecure and clumsy Mary Sue (To EL James' credit, a perfect replica of Stephenie Meyer's Bella Swan).<br /><br />There are some guilty pleasure erotica scenes, but they're more mechanically described than erotic.  There are too few for this book to be billed as erotica-- You're far more likely to get better scenes in your run-of-the-mill Regency romance. The scenes are clearly inspired by little more foray into the BDSM community than a Wikipedia search. There are a number of anecdotes about this book producing a large spike in the number of sex-related emergency room visits.<br /><br />More than all of this, the relationship between the protagonists is clearly abusive and controlling, and no one in any relationship should ever put up with such horrible treatment. Love is no reason to take abuse, and it's disgusting that this book sold as many copies as it did with such a negative featured relationship.<br /><br />To her credit, James at least gives a plausible ending to readers, whether or not they like it.  Ultimately, I won't be reading the next two books.
B006R1T40I|3.0|Sorry, Bonnie, but those first two tracks really suck.  What were you thinking.  This albumn would have been so much better if you had just left them off completely.  As far as track two goes, well, you know the saying, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  Track one is just bland, boring, no depth, in plain words it sucked.  The rest of the tracks are pretty cool, and a couple are downright awesome, but I just don't expect to hear even one single crapy track from you, and this CD has 2!!!  Drop the first two tracks.  Did you even listen to them or were you in a hurry to finish?  3 stars.
0345529057|5.0|I ordered this product through Barnes and Noble, though it is exactly the same thing. I really enjoy reading this series, I'm still on the first book and have been very anxious to continually read more every night. I like how the story line jumps from each characters view point. The quality of the books themselves is good, what you can expect from a regular book. My only complaint is that the third book \\"A Storm of Swords\\" came with one page that wasn't full cut off from the paper, I'll include a picture. Overall this product is well worth the small amount of money you pay, and not to mention you get 4 full books! I usually don't read books much but this has surely put the video game controller down!
B00417HV14|5.0|this guy is different from all other performers in that he is indeed a up and coming star of rock and blues.<br />His soulful renditions of old classics is heartfelt, his rendition of blues is quite different and sets him<br />above other performers who try and fail in the genre.<br />A good example is The Great Flood. He co-wrote this gem which surely will become a classic. His guitar work<br />is amazing and heartfelt. One thing Joe has which I believe separates him from others is his flexibility of performance with his guitars. Eric Clapton has already praised him as being one of the finest blues players<br />today. It will be very interesting to see how the guy matures and what direction this maturity will bring.
1250004217|5.0|I finished this book ten minutes ago and when I closed the last page I thought, \\"I am forever altered by this story.\\"  Maybe it's because I was an American living in Paris at one point in my life.  Maybe it's because my husband's grandparents (to whom I am very close) fought against the Nazis in Europe as (Jewish) American soldiers.  Maybe it's because I have young children myself.  I'm not sure why this book had such an impact on me but it did and I highly recommend it as a piece of 'historical fiction.'  I did not know about the Vel D'Hiv before I read this book.  I walked on those same streets many times while I was living in Paris.  Last year when I took my children to the synogogue in the Marais where my grandparents in laws were married, I didn't realize how the French were complicit in the Jews' expulsion.  This book has opened my eyes to a shameful moment in world history that none of us should forget.  Would New Yorkers (my home town) behave any differently than Parisians did if orders came in to round up all of the Mexicans?  African Americans?  I would hope so but we are a city of people who comb the obituaries looking for good apartments.  Never Let us Forget.  Thanks to the moving writing of Tatiana de Rosney, Sarah is now a part of my own history.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|great game! very addicting. only issue freezing occasional and adding time to missions. makes it a little annoying when it resents to additional hours instead of minutes to complete tasks
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Adaptations of this masterpiece have always seemed to me to idealize the period, as if everyone is always perfectly coiffed and nothing is ever out of place or even dusty. This film has filled in the story's background with great depth and color, taking us into a real English country dance, with all of its raucous energy. We see into people's homes with their daily activities, tasks, and yes, even the messes. The dialog feels like conversations that are face to face, not speeches posed across a giant stage. The overall result is a greater feeling of intimacy between you and the movie, almost as if it's not seen on screen but through a window... or even a mirror. I must have seen a dozen or more adaptations of this immortal story, but this time I felt like I was there, and a part of it all.<br /><br />As for the acting, I thought Matthew Macfadyen was the best Darcy I have ever seen. All of the actors were excellent, but I want to make special mention of Talulah Riley's performance as the bookish sister, Mary.  Most adaptations seem to disregard or even ridicule Mary for her social cluelessness. But this movie is brave enough to let us see her in greater depth and compassion, as a girl whose cluelessness is really just an extreme awkwardness, and therefore something we can all relate to. We even see her beauty and vulnerability as I have never seen on screen. In a master stroke of screenwriting, we see her suffer great pain and shame after her embarrassing attempt to be socially adept by performing at the pianoforte, albeit badly, to be publicly humiliated by her mother's loud declaration that \\"You have delighted us long enough\\" and her crumbling defeat from it. It is then that we see Mr. Bennet in a rare moment of warmth, comforting his disconsolate little girl, not aloof and sarcastic as usual, but holding her in his arms.  In this way, too, it breathed more life into the story in all of its fullness.<br /><br />That, for me, made this movie feel like the story was finally a part of myself, not just a tale about others.finally a part of myself, not just a tale about others.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This was an outstanding purchase. The quality was superb. My dsl is only 1.5M and it never skipped a beat.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|One of those books that you can't put down. Very different to what I expected but isn't that all the more surprising. Had to read it before I saw the movie and glad I did.
0811876373|1.0|I bought this book for our family and my 11 year old because it was highly recommended on Amazon as being fantastic. It's fantastic for a pro, and is all about elaborate decorations. This is not a book I would recommend for the average user, new to cake pops, looking for some ideas. Also, I do not recommend it for children, unless you want to do all the work yourself or your child is becoming an expert at cake decorating. Thankfully, there are more books out there now. If you are not advanced, don't get this book. Get the 175 Best Babycakes Cake Pop Maker Recipes. It has actual recipes for appetizers, dips, and all kinds of great ideas. It also has decorating ideas that are a million times more practical.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I really don't understand why this movie did so badly at the theater other than that it was sabotaged by the critics and bad marketing.  I read some of the critics reviews and all I can say is that they didn't see the same movie I did.  Their comments were so odd that I really question whether some of them even bothered watching the movie before writing the review.  I love adventure and sci fi movies but I'm picky about which ones I watch.  I absolutely loved this movie and I have to say it was true to the original book.  Which may be why some folks had problems with it. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote A Princess of Mars (original title) in 1912.  It was a brilliant envisioning of the possibilities of space travel. Disney went with that original vision rather than 'updating' the movie to what we know now 100 years later. So watch the movie in the spirit it was intended and enjoy the adventure.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|It is horrifying to read Shin's story, but more horrifying to realise that nothing is being done to help the prisoners of these labour camps. Blaine Harden has done a fantastic job with what is a difficult subject. I can only hope that something can be done to end this madness. Fantastic book I could not put down
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game !!!!love the graphics! !! I'm not having any problems loading the game or getting off the game. download! !
B003VWU2WA|3.0|Works well for it's specific use, but it seems limited in the 5 options that it has. I know those of you that have it will say that it's software specific and you would be correct, but when I fill the five options in the software that I am using and I'm looking for more then it does not have enough. Would love it if you could customize your clicks (three clicks, rotate and click, etc.), but for now it does what I want it to for the most part. I would recommend it for light use (volume, browser scrolling, and a like). But nothing user heavy.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This is a fun little game. Some levels are very simple but some require thought and strategy-a couple rely on a fair amount of luck. I recommend it.
B0000640VN|4.0|OK, I like a good \\"Chick Flick\\" romantic comedy now and then, I hate to admit, because they're generally a good escape from reality, into the ever-intriguing world of Guy/Girl relationships.  My first thought after viewing this film is that it's a pretty good one in the Chick Flick genre, without too much junk stuck in to ruin it.  Hugh Jackman is awesome as the 19th century Duke bachelor thrust into the 21st century accidently by a time-travelling scientist.  And Meg Ryan is effective as his modern-day love interest.  My second thought was that this movie is a very mild PG-13.  I.e., I think that even a 12 year old could watch it and not get an unhealthy dose of toxic cultural poison (unlike, say, Morning Glory or Twilght Breaking Wind).  Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't an intellectual masterpiece, but it works. I highly recommend it for a date night, or you could even watch it together with your 12-and-up children.  It's romantic, it's premise is neat, and it has imaginative details (like pictures taken by the Time-Traveller that show a 19th century ball but taken on a modern small color camera!).  It even gives us some life-lessons.  Also makes us think about modern conveniences (like the elevator!)<br /><br />Jackman is great -- he's consistenly 19th century, but when he realizes that he's been transported in time, he quickly adapts to modern life.  And then he doles out a healthy dose of thoughtful yet pointed criticism of the modern lifestyle.  Meg Ryan's character is very unlikeable at first (purposefully I think), but she warms up quickly, after Jackman chivalrously recovers her stolen laptop using his horsemanship skills.  I also like the character of her brother (Brekin Meyer), who adds a touch of comedic, familial humanity to the cast, and her visionary scientist former boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) who has discovered portals in time and how to get from the present to the past & back again.  All these characters Work in this enjoyable movie!  But the best character is Hugh Jackman's Duke Leopold.<br /><br />In brief, the scientist has gotten Leopold to the future, Leopold and Kate get entangled in each other emotionally, but then the scientist tries to get him back near the movie's end.  Will Kate accept the scientist's crazy time-portal idea, and go with him?  But don't try to think too hard about the various intellectal problems with the time travel, just pour the wine, pop the popcorn, buy into the silly premise, and enjoy the light yet entertaining romantic plot!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I wish I had this book years ago when I felt so alone and \\"different\\".  I never saw things the way the other kids did, I always needed more information and more details.  Being criticized for \\"always reading\\" and needing time to myself made for a not very popular little girl. \\"You think too much\\" and \\"stop over analyzing everything\\" were phrases I heard often. This book has validated me as okay being me.  It does make me feel powerful in who I am.  I am buying copies to give to others who I feel are suffering for being \\"different\\".  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Susan Cain.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! I strongly suggest you read the book first, before you see the movie. The movie is ok, but the books are addicting.

0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is the Mocking Jay. After the Quarter Quell, she is rescued by the rebel forces too overthrow the establishment in the capitol. She and the surviving victors and the refugees from a destroyed district 12 including Gale and her family are enlisted in the war against oppression. Once again the Capitol becomes yet another arena in the fight for democracy and humanity in general. The body count is high by the end of the story.<br /><br />So here is the rivetting conclusion to an awesome series. Another fantastic page turner that will be impossible to put down and forget for a very long time. Kudos to Ms. Collins for a mesmerizing story. I give this one 5 explosive arrows.

0439023521|5.0|I don't often see movies or read books due to media hype. After seeing and enjoying the movie adaptation of this story I rushed out and bought the book. Panem is the new incarnation of the United states that was obliterated during a violent civil war. In the dark days there were uprisings and rebellions that were eventually quashed by the powers that be in the Capitol. As punishment for these insurrections, THE HUNGER GAMES were established to show the districts just who was in control. Two adolescents were chosen in a lottery -one of each gender to participate in the games and fight their peers to the death in the arena. Catniss Everdeen takes the place of her younger sister whose name was pulled. Also chosen was Peeta Mellark.The two must train and learn to fight and survive and the last tribute standing is named the victor.<br /><br />The book itself goes deeper into the background of the games and explores the ideas of the totalitarinism of Panem and how it's citizens are mere puppets in life and in the games.  Catniss is a rebellious character who doesn't want to but is forced to follow the rules. The games are televised so she cannot overtly pull a fast one and risk reprisals for her friends and family in district 12.  The story is well written. There are elements of suspense and plenty of action. Themes include compassion for others when self preservation is the norm. There is romance as manufactured by the game makers and Catniss and Peeta have to play the game to survive in the arena and the world at large. Any deviation is cause for treason and punishment. This book was a real page turner as it has some thing for every one. It is rated in the Young adult category but adults will enjoy the book as well. I highly recommend it and give the story five mocking jay pins.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|usually I stay away from these games but this one is great.good graphics yet it doesn't slow the game.fun mini games and easy to level up.like most games you need to buy items with real money,thankfully the quests give me plenty of coin and acorns. you don't have to buy items with real money but if you want the advantage to level up.try it.I might later on but I don't need to yet since this game is generous with rewards. love that this game is free so try it sometime!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|When you pause a show about once per episode to marvel, \\"This is so $@&#'ing good!\\" you know you're watching something special. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but Game of Thrones is a masterpiece of television. The stories, characters, and sets are all top-notch. You never know what's going to happen -- unless you read the book, then you'll marvel at how everything is just how you imagined it (or so my wife says).<br /><br />I'm even tempted to subscribe to HBO just to be able to watch the now-showing second season in a timely manner.

0439023491|5.0|The exciting sequel to the Hunger Games. Catniss and Peeta are victors of the games. Through an unprecedented move by the Game makers there were two winners declared. Now they must endure a victory tour through the other 11 districts of Panem where they are hated as they represent the games and are a reminder why their children are dead. President Snow hates them as he feels they upstaged the capitol by pulling a few fast tricks. He especially hates Catniss as he fears the kind of damage she could do if she started an uprising. Security is tightened up in district 12 as a result of the games, Peeta and Catniss must also compete in the games again after a special edition is called. There are several surprises in this book which all lead up to Mocking jay, the third installment. Once again the book was a page turner and I found it hard to stop reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this nail biter as much as the Hunger Games.  5 more mocking jay pins for another great read.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]
B0052VUNHC|5.0|A wonderful read, has it all, love, tension, betrayal and downright nastiness. Lots of twists and turns...some you truly do not see coming and the main characters, though both pieces of work, are deep and incredibly likable.
0062011847|4.0|I can say with confidence that I've read just about every Discworld book ever written. Once I started, I couldn't stop. Sam Vimes is one of the series's best characters. In Snuff, Vimes and his family (son Young Sam is now of speaking age) go to the country for some well-deserved rest -- whether Vimes likes it or not. Thankfully, it's not all butlers and tea parties.<br /><br />Instead, it's about an oppressed species/race that nobody gives a rat's tail about. Vimes is at his best with a worthy antagonist, which you won't really find here. Instead, it's more class warfare. Vimes is a 99%er with 1%er money. It's interesting to see him (and Pratchett) balance out those aspects, but it really works.<br /><br />I wouldn't put this on par with Night Watch, or even its storyline predecessor, Thud! Still, it's a very enjoyable book fit for Disworld fans casual or hardcore, along with anybody else who fancies a tale with action, intrigue and humor.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|Just a somewhat shorter, mostly non-spoiler review.  Been a fan of Nightwish since Angels Fall First.  I was a fan of Nightwish with Tarja, and remained a fan of Nightwish with Anette.  I have long regarded Tuomas as a compositional genius, and his lyrics have consistently hit home for me.<br /><br />When Dark Passion Play came out, I found some of it to be of a very good quality (Poet and the Pendulum in particular).  But for Nightwish, not their best material imo.<br /><br />In this album, Tuomas and the crew have returned to their former glory 100%.  Anette now fits in perfectly with the style (imo in DPP, she was awesome but the music was in part begging for more operatics by design).  Some new tricks are wonderful surprises in Imaginaerum.  Anette's vocals are truly taken advantage of in this album, we get to hear more of a variety of styles which bring out her talent moreso than previously.  Marco, I almost didn't recognize his voice in one song, thought it was a guest singer at first, another wonderful surprise.  Yet in true Nightwish style they retain a consistent and overall alternating heavy and light theme, filled with a typical dark fantasy and deeply felt vibe, and very thoroughly layered and complex instruments.  Emppu has made me happy by adding a few more riffs than in DPP.  Jukka's drumming is very complexly enthralling and delightfully unpredictable, more like in the older albums I loved so much (some DPP songs, like Master Passion Greed, were repetitive and predictable, uncharacteristic for Nightwish).  The music has returned to Tuomas's exceptional and consistent compositional genius as well.<br /><br />My only complaints are minor but threefold (a spoiler or two to follow in this paragraph).  One, I found Last Ride and Song of Myself to be a bit too similar in sound to be placed consecutively, though each song is fantastic nonetheless.  I'd have separated them with a few songs in between.  Also, I felt disappointed that there wasn't a true epic-length song in this album, as Nightwish usually does.  The Song of Myself was heading in that direction, but the second half of the 12 minute song is more or less actors reciting lines with light background music.  Don't get me wrong, Song of Myself is very fantastic, but only the first 6 minutes really count as a song.  Their lines were an interesting segment, but it's not really a song.  Imaginaerum the finale, should have been kept for the movie, as it's not really a song that works as a standalone metal band song, definitely something to put up to movie credits instead.  Otherwise, the first song right up the the middle of Song of Myself (2nd to last song) are a truly fantasmic experience. :)<br /><br />Definitely buy this!

B005Q1W10A|2.0|The delightful British time piece (full of witty dialogue) of season 1, sadly deteriorates to a shallow American soap opera in season 2. I doubt whether it can be saved @ all in season 3. But let's pray they muster some brilliant brains & manages the impossible.
B005POK858|5.0|This game is the best JRPG on the android market. The upgrade system leaves a lot up to you, the fighting system is smooth, decent story for a JRPG, and it will get you 20-30 hours of playtime. If you are a fan of super nintendo style RPGs, you will love this game.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I flappin' loved this book.  The writing was clever and I had several laugh out loud moments.  I was a little worried it would be more porn like with all the reviews.  For me the sexual parts were done well and the story of Christian & Anastasia was much more highlighted for me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed their interactions.  The contract and emails were hysterical.  I'm telling you, people at my gym must have thought I lost my mind since I was giggling like a teenager.  If you have ever had that \\"control freak dysfunctional\\" relationship you will definitely find the humor in this book welcomed.  It was a page turner; I enjoyed this trilogy so much I'm going to read them again on my vacation.

B005ZB91KY|5.0|We enjoyed the movie but the reason we gave it five stars is because we were very happy with the resolution of the streaming video.  We love the Amazon Video on Demand service.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This album is amazing.  If someone asked me what my favorite album was, I don't know what I would say, but this album would definitely come to mind.  It's mixed really well and I love every song on the deluxe edition.  Amy just won the best singer award at Revolver's golden god award show for this album.  I've been listening to so much great symphonic metal and related music lately that I think I'm going to throw some money at a pair of Yamaha HS studio monitor speakers and buy the CD in addition to the mp3s I've already purchased, so I can hear all the nuances in the upper range.  This album along with Within Temptation's the Unforgiving, and Nightwish's Imaginaerum are probably the best albums from the last 12 months in this genre.<br /><br />If you like the metal chicks genre, I also recommend checking out Requiem for the Indifferent by Epica, Dark Adrenaline by Lacuna Coil, Breaking the Code by the SLoT, and the latest albums from Halestorm, Edge of Paradise, and Nemesea.  The next albums on the horizon are going to be from Delain and the one I'm really interested to hear will be the first LP from Ashentide (finally an American symphonic metal band...you can download their EP for free through their Facebook page).

B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book was not very good.  I agree with other readers that the cafeteria scenes were a bit juvenile for a college campus setting.  The love story was extremely repetitive.  It was predictable in that you knew every time Abby had any type of interaction with a male, that Travis would be right there to either threaten him or beat him up.  I failed to read the final chapter in the book because I was not invested in the characters enough to find out what became of them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was infected with this book and couldn't put it down. It kept my interest all the way to the end and couldn't wait to get the second book. Maybe for someone that really doesn't know alot about S&M this was the perfect book to give some basic detail. I loved it. I couldn't wait to see what Grey was going to do next!

B00005JKG9|5.0|Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin head up this adaptation of an award-studded stage production. Naturally, given a cast so drenched with talent, the audience is going to want to see them flaunt their acting chops, and thankfully, that's the key to this entire production. Without a tight band of intense, versatile, believable characters at its core there's no chance a plot that revolves around sales calls and a bland office robbery would be anything more than a snoozer. But in this cast's hands, with this combination of sharp, passionate dialog and sleazy, self-serving lack of morality, it's totally entrancing. Like many play-to-film interpretations, there is a certain amount of stagnation in terms of the film's scenery. The vast majority of the action takes place in a sales office, with phone calls, police interviews and (de)motivational speakers providing the flavor. Those tame surroundings work in a variety of unusual ways, though: as a means to ground the story in reality, an exercise in diverting our attention solely to the acting, and a device to give the rare peeks outside the office's not-so-friendly confines an added dash of color. A master class in cadence and characterization, it's a deep, emphatic and intoxicating look at the gamut of techniques a desperate salesman can (and will) employ.
0307352145|4.0|The title of the book is very powerful though the book is more of an aspirational work. It includes a nice discussion about introverts and extraverts, how the world works for them, and of some of the contributing factors for the introverted personality types. The author quotes many relevant studies that casual readers and researchers will find interesting. Some of valuable findings for me were:<br />- introverts and extraverts have different stimulation levels (i.e. we all need some level of stimulation and the sweet spot is much higher for the extraverts than for the introverts)<br />- The U.S. generally encourages gregariousness and generally works best for extraverts (think classroom and office space setup, recruiting processes, focus on sales, popular culture, etc)<br />- Asia and Africa tend to be dominated by introverts whereas in part due to the U.S. and European histories of immigration, the latter (U.S. in particular) tend to be fertile ground for extraverts<br />- Adaptation & recognition are keys<br /><br />There aren't major discoveries in this book but it should be of some interest to introverts (describing the water to the fish) and of greater interest to employers, managers, parents, and anyone who is on the other side of the personality spectrum.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I like running and for long time I have quitted listening to music while running, because the phone's wire always has pissed me off.<br />Recently I have bought a JABRA Sport neckband and I use this Kokkia device with my iPod Nano (6th) and it just fits perfectly.<br />Running with music again is now comfortable and enjoyable. Even using the ipod in the wristband the sound was perfect without any jamming or noise. I haven't tested it yet among other bluetooth users, so I could give a better response about interferences in the signal.<br />With a handy, I have only tested it indoors, but the signal was clear in both ways; I don't now how it behaves in a crowdy or windy environment.<br />My only worry is about rain, but it can be fixed with a protected armband.<br /><br />For now, it fits its purpose.<br />I definitely recommend this product.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|I actually finished this game in less than 3 hours of play time. There are only two main areas and a few bonus levels, totaling about 25 total levels. Certainly there is a third area in development, but for as few levels as this (while a couple were darn near impossible) I was able to figure it all out and get three stars on all levels inside of 3 hours play time.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|I only recently got this album. When i first listened to this album i was thrown off a little. Irish instrumentation has been co-opted into bad film music and sanitized dancing shows. But on the second and third tries this album is  permanently in my CD player i love this album so much. Very rich, so rich it took a few spins for me to get into. Now one of my favorites. Not the traditional like The Chieftans just total rock n roll glory.<br /><br />This Pogues record really rocks. The band is so good. Shane McGowan such a cool singer. With a  whiskey voice. A great songwriter. Great energetic music. The great ballad \\"Fairytale Of New York\\" holds up so well.  Beginning to end great songs. Great storytelling. Such a cool record. The Pogues rock.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This band is great. I love a good anthem and they do it well. Also I like having it on the cloud, very convenient!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|Based on the biographical book authored by Colin Clark (Eddie Raymayne), the story follows the week he spent with Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), while she was filming \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" in London. Upon Colin's graduation from university, he embarks on an opportunity to work on Lawrence Olivier's (Kennth Branaugh) new film, whom he had met at a party and is a mutual acquaintance. After much prodding with Hugh Perceval and Colin's persistence to arrive at Perceval's office everyday until a job is opened, Olivier comes in and offers him the opportunity of a lifetime. Colin's first task is to find a private residence for Marilyn while she is in London. He has found the perfect home secluded from prying eyes which impresses the primary film crew. Now with the trust and his passion to prove himself, his next project will be even a more bigger challenge. He is chosen to keep Marilyn company for a week while her husband, Arthur Miller, has to jet off back to America.<br />During the film we see Marilyn's insecurities and child like behavior. She does not enjoy being alone and with her flirtatiousness she seduces Colin. He is warned from those who know her best that her infatuation with him will not last.<br />Michelle Williams' portrayal of Marilyn was right on especially in a scene showing her dancing on the set as Olivier and the film crew watches in awe. Eddie Raymayne played the naive Clark very well showing how touching his relationship with Marilyn was. Watching the chemistry between the two of them I could see that Clark was very protective of Marilyn and did not want her to be hurt. He truly cared for her while at the same time he was enthralled with her stardom and beauty.

B005LAII0I|5.0|I went and saw this movie with my brother and wasn't sure what to expect but I loved it! It is my favorite Snow White movie by far and I loved the soundtrack. I liked how the colors were vivid and the scenery was beautiful. Also how the story was funny and lighthearted. I would say what I enjoyed the most was that Snow White was just the right amount of heroine and damsel mixed together. She kicked butt while still maintaining her princess sweetness. I am looking forward to buying it as soon as it comes out.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing an intriguing interview with the author - I couldn't resist finding out more. The book did not disappoint because it is equally engaging! The writing style is approachable and informative. I liked the organization of the material, the thoughtful presentation, and the thought-provoking nature of some of the stories. An all-around enjoyable read.

B007FXLZ9K|5.0|SHAME  is a brilliant, courageous, visually and emotionally stunning film by a new team of collaborators - director/writer Steve McQueen, cinematographer Sean Babbitt, and actor Michael Fassbender first gave us the unforgettable HUNGER and now they have teamed to present yet another unique work that will likely go down as one of the finest films of the decade.  Abi Morgan (The Hours television series, The Iron Lady, Tsunami, Sex Traffic) co wrote the screenplay with McQueen; they seem to have an affinity for each other.  This film has been controversial from the first mention that it was being made and controversy usually means that people are reacting strongly (both positively and negatively) to an art work - the true indication that this is by definition Art.<br /><br />The extraordinarily complex story of 21st century isolation and inability to connect with other people except on a unidirectional level of sexual contact is distilled in the role of Brandon (Michael Fassbender, in a multifaceted yet intensely focused performance): Brandon's life is dominated by near anonymous sexual encounters, internet pornography, and multiple daily escapes into onanism, He is quiet, handsome, and utterly irresistible to women and he takes advantage of this preoccupation with sexuality as a loner, living in an apartment, free of relationships, holding down a fine job as an account manager.  This changes when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) `moves in' and her unwanted presence alters Brandon's modus operandi. Brandon's boss, the married with children Dave (James Badge Dale) envies Brandon's way with women, always losing in his unpracticed approaches to pickups to Brandon's superior techniques.  Dave meets Sissy at a nightclub where Sissy is singing (Mulligan's rendition of Kander and Ebb's `New York, New York' was apparently shot in one take at 3 AM while cameras focuses on the three actors - genuine responses to t a deeply moving moment) and ends up sleeping with Sissy. Brandon, frustrated with Sissy's presence and behavior ultimately leads to his throwing her out of his apartment - an act that has an impactful result. Meanwhile Brandon attempts to `relate' both emotionally and physically with fellow office worker Marianne (Nicole Beharie) with embarrassing results. And in his frustration he walks the night streets having sexual encounters with multiple partners out in the open, in a gay bar, and in thwarted attempts to pickup a girl whose boyfriend beats him severely.<br /><br />Much of the success of this art piece is due to the manner in which McQueen presents his story.  Many of the scenes ore simply faces on the subway and Brandon's fantasies, all accompanied by a musical score by Harry Escott who has elected to use multiple recordings of Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations and Preludes and Fugues - the sublime simplicity of Bach's statements in marked contrast to the chaos in Brandon's mind and actions. In a splendid scene as Brandon awaits a subway, when his mind is tortured and out of control cinematographer Babbitt distorts the image like an acid trip.  But most impressive is the choice to concentrate on Brandon's face as he eyes tricks or faces the world in which he lives in his out of control state  - a face so misguided and needy and yet sensuous that it makes the film draw us inside a character's psyche like few other films have been able.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender does the impossible; he creates a role that despite the behavioral abnormalities remains a man about whom we care about deeply. At film's beginning there is subtle male frontal nudity and Fassbender's remarks about that are mature and enlightening: `To be honest with you again, I think it's the idea of male frontal nudity. It just baffles me: Women can parade around naked all the time, but the guy conveniently has his pants on. I remember my mom always complaining about that to me, saying, \\"This is such `b-s', it's always the women who are naked\\" ...so I did this one for you, Mom!  Everyone involved in this film is to be commended for the highest level of artistic achievement.  And that extends to the credits at film's end: each participant's name is flashed on the screen with a single musical chord on the piano. The effect is respectful and in keeping with the brilliance of the movie.  Grady Harp, April 10so I did this one for you, Mom!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great little app. Had to figure out the exit strategy on Kindle Fire, as it's not clear cut.<br /><br />One issue bugs me a lot. This is supposed to be a social game, but each time I try to visit another village, I get a meassage to update and restart the game. I have done this too many times to count, and still cannot visit other villages. Kinda makes the social part of the app moot.

Oh and ps if you are one of the people who hates this game because of two levels get your eyes checked it said new worlds are coming soon. Its the worlds most popular moble electronic device line of apps that doesn't mean its perfect.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book. If you are a someone who has any nostalgia at all for the 1980's pop culture of arcade games, D&D, music and movies you will find something in this book. Although set in a really distopian future, the book captures some of the love for the 80's and mixes it with a horrific view of what could happen...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Hey this game rocks! Here's a trick to get out of the game without having to turn off your kindle! Hit the stuff botton then hit opitions the Kindle home tab will pop up! Everyone else didn't know how!:)
B006O5XYWG|5.0|THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE IT WAS SMART, FUNNY HAPPY AND SAD.  I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE HAD IT ALL<br />IT WILL DRAW YOU IN AND REALLY TAKE YOU ON A RIDE. LOVED IT A LOT. MY KIDS PICKED IT AND I WASN'T SURE ABOUT IT BUT I WAS WRONG, ITS AWSOME.
B005C7SXMS|3.0|\\"Submarine\\" has, at least to my reading, been compared to 1998's classic, \\"Rushmore.\\"  Both movies reek of the indie spirit and feature struggling prep-school quasi-outcasts whose delusions of self-worth fall dizzyingly short of reality.  But where \\"Rushmore\\" was saved by the innate goodness of its hero and the movie's charmingly whimsical tone, \\"Submarine\\" fails to rise to the heights of the Wes Anderson film.<br /><br />Oliver Tate is our hero in \\"Submarine,\\" a struggling teenager in the mid-1980s. A victim of a cruel hoax by the love of his young life, Oliver surprisingly finds himself in the catbird seat.  What ensues as Oliver confronts increasingly melodramatic plto points is an exercise in Oliver's complete lack of social skills and genuine empathy for his fellow man.  It's not that Oliver doesn't consider other people's feelings - it's that he thinks about them and almost invariably draws the wrong conclusion.  While many have found the movie to be both poignant and on the mark, too many key points seemed too contrived to sustain my interest.  I can suspend disbelief and will even believe the ridiculous in the context of a good movie, but \\"Submarine\\" is too clever and shocking by half.<br /><br />There are far worse coming of age tales out there, but there are many that are superior.
B004SIP73U|5.0|Forget the overall story....if you went to Catholic grammar school in the NorthEastern suburbs , or cities, during the early 1960's, this movie is as accurate as it can get!  You will have flashbacks (and probably not very positive ones) as you view this movie. Yet, there is a sense of family and warmth as well, especially centered around the time of the season the story occurs. Again, I am not reviewing the movie (although I do believe Viola Davis should have won the Academy Award that year for Best Supporting Actress, her 20 minutes on screen is unforgettable), I am stating that as a Catholic boy who went to school during the 60s in the NY area, this movie nails the look, the attitude, the environment, the religious tensions, and nuns, oh yes nuns, to a  \\"T\\".
0671027344|5.0|This book helped me in so many ways when I was in middle school. It gave me someone to latch onto. It gave me a shoulder to lean on. It gave me hope. This is such a timeless novel, and every time I read it I discover something new; something new about the novel, something new about myself, something new about the world. You can read it just for fun, to make the time pass, or you can read it looking for something more.

0743289412|2.0|I am a big Stephen King fan, and have been reading his stuff (sometimes over and over again) for over 30 years.  I am listening to this one, and I have to say that I agree that the cutsie-pie language is incredibly annoying. It is so repetitive and annoying that it takes away from the story. It makes it difficult to get through and prevents me from caring at all about the characters. It is very disappointing and all i want to do is yell \\"Shut up!\\"  I'm plowing through it because it is mildly interesting. Definitely will not read this one again...
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Man, do i love this film & this soundtrack.  Stellar. Genius. Haunting.  Fitting.  This music worked so well w/ in the film.
1452101248|5.0|I've made the carmelized garlic tart and the cauliflower salad, and both were really really good.  With regard to the tart, one reviewer recommended doubling the garlic and halving the cheese--maybe, but it was awfully good as it stands.  Rich, but very very nice.  I am looking forward to cooking my way through this book, and I've ordered his other book as well.  The recipes have pairings of flavors that I might not otherwise have thought of, but they resonate in the mind of the tongue as one reads them.  The recipes are creative, often a nice mix of sweet and hot, not overburdened with oil.  I like the fact that the author is not a vegetarian, so the ingredients and approaches are not wackily \\"healthy,\\" and one can easily use the resulting plates to accompany meats and fish (the cauliflower salad, room temp, with seared, peppered tuna steaks, for example).  I very much like having new, interesting, delicious ways to present a wide range of vegetables.  This book is a winner!! (I have the white-cover, metric version of the book.)
B007IK44CK|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie! I was skeptical at first because the last MI was sappy. But I was pleasantly surprised as this one was spectacular!<br />Definitely worth the purchase or the rental.  My only regret is that I didn't get to see it in the theater as I am sure it would have been wonderful to see on a big screen.

B003Y5H5HY|4.0|The Blu-Ray discs have ALL the EXTRA bonus features.  Not the regular Dvd.  That was a bum-deal... Guess we'll have to get a Blu-Ray Player now.  The price was SPOT on!  That is why I ordered the 3 disc set:  B/C it was a better VALUE.  No biggie.  I knew I was going to buy the film anyway.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|When I started reading this book, I didn't think it was the best writing I had ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty entertaining. Mainly just a difference in writing style preference, I guess.<br /><br />If you maybe felt that way after reading the first page or two, do NOT be dissuaded! Good prose, captures interest if you like fantasy genre.<br /><br />Recently finished the third book in the sandman slim series (which I loved) and the \\"zero\\" series (also loved).  This series was recommended to me by amazon for the last few months, kept ignoring it. FINALLY picked it up today, and I have not been able to put it down. About 50% of the way through, and I can't imagine this book disappointing me.<br /><br />Definitely buy, and definitely enjoy!

B0073XORLU|1.0|I wish I could review the music. DRM prevented this.<br />I listen on an audiophile system served from a computer. So when I purchase new music I import it to the hard drive. Simple.<br />Alright, 24 bit content and a 5.1 mix, here we go... (obviously ignoring the reduced CD version)<br />There's some DRM on this DVD that prevents importing the files. I tried importing the audio, making a disc image copy, copying the video_ts folder, and nothing was allowed. I don't have time to learn how to hack this stuff and shouldn't have to when I purchase it!<br />Oh yeah, the audio_ts folder is empty. Everything's in the video_ts folder which means the 5.1 mix is lossy.<br />You can play it directly from disc with a DVD Video media player only. So I'd have to record this digitally in real time to copy it?! And the surround is lossy?!<br />Forget it! Returned for refund. Why would anyone even make something this messed up?
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Jason Mraz, however, he really won me over with this album. If you listen to the lyrics of his song you can tell that he is pouring everything into each of these songs.<br /><br />He not only made an excellent easy listening mixtape, but he also put together one of the most inspirational albums in recent memory. Although this album won't change the music industry, I feel that this album can really impact people's mindset. Instead of listening to DEPRESSING songs why not listen to Jason Mraz and feel uplifted, revived, and inspired.<br /><br />If you dont want to listen to the whole CD, which I think you really should, listen to these tracks (SPOTIFY). Dont just listen, hear and feel these lyrics:<br /><br />Living in the Moment<br />I Won't Give Up<br />93 Million Miles<br />The World As I See It<br /><br />This CD will be in my player for a long time.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|This is a book and story for teens.  It has a mild love story, with no sexuality.  However, the idea of a government using children to fight to the death, was  quite disturbing.  I feel the reason it is so popular is because it stresses mans constant search to make a better situation out of an impossible one.  I will not be buying the rest of the trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addicting, and I have been playing since I downloaded it.This game is one of the best ive ever heard.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addictive game. when you want to exit the game just go to options and it will allow you to from there.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Really liked this book. Sometimes you need to read other authors and come back to Child to realize how enjoyable his books can be. Not as dreary as some of his recent novels.
B005PYZG6E|1.0|Got this and found the unit totally unusable for a Nikon D5100.  The screw wouldn't even hold the camera in tight since it didn't have enough threads.  Never seen anything so ridiculous.  This itself made it useless for any operation since you don't want to risk your expensive camera flying off.  Second, the useless factor continued with the balancing - could not get this to balance with the D5100 even with a 35mm prime lens. 2.1 lb rating is bollocks. It needs more weights.  Unfortunately, no way to add it on.  The gimball also is really awful, just flops around with no smoothness.  Finally, the construction in general is flimsy and in no way worth the price they are asking.  Really, this is appears meant for mounting a fisher price camera toy, you know the ones that are pretend make believe for kids, so they can make believe it's balancing their camera.  Because that's all you'll get with this product - make believe balancing.  If you really want one of these steadycams, you'll need to step up to the PRO model which is two to three times the price but it works.  Don't cheapen out else just don't bother getting one.
0143119680|4.0|This novel was all about the atmosphere and sub-plot. I wasn't super attached to Diana, but I liked her well enough to keep reading. What really caught me was the world plot that drives the love story between the main characters.<br /><br />Plus I'm a sucker for any book which can do a good job re-imagining the supernatural standards, (how magic works, magic versus spellcraft, vampire guidelines/weaknesses and hunting, etc).<br />Also interesting was the bit of focus on the SCIENCE of these supernaturals!<br /><br />I did find myself really engrossed in finding out what happens NEXT, and what interesting things the Vamp characters have done in their long lives. I am looking forward to the next volume

B000OSC3GM|5.0|A most excellent film: script and actors. Chilling in that it is so plausible. A must see for anyone interested in politics and government. On my list of best of the best.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read.  The plot was captivating, I found, myself not being able to put the book down.  I read the entire trilogy in less than a week. I hope there are more to come
B004EPZ0AC|3.0|I saw this at the Theatre and the first one is definitely better. This is not bad though, and still entertaining enough. This one is more for kids than the first one, but there are some good parts in it for adults too.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|The reviews of this film are all over the board. Meryl Streep is a stellar actress and won an Academy award for this movie This is likely because of both her acting ability and perhaps for the outstanding makeup (the makeup team also won an Academy Award) portraying her at different points in her life. The movie was sad and I feel injured part of her image portraying her dementia and more so because of her transition from idealistic and innocent child like, beliefs, turning into inflexibility and an apparent autocratic leadership style. Margaret Thatcher did serve 11 years as Prime Minister, which with the volatile form of British government, will likely never be surpassed. The movie itself is somewhat slow and boring and the snippets of Thatcher's youth, growth and transition into politics in no way covered her live. However, only an indepth historical biographical book could. So in all fairness, that is to be expected.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a very enjoyable game. very nice setting and just a fun mellow way to pass the time. sure it is a puzzle type game but very original in design. almost a non game like myst was.

B007NZDES0|5.0|I went to see this show in London on May 31st last year.<br /><br />The best concert experience of my life! She sounded like a dream. I have been waiting for this DVD even before they announced they're filming the tour for a future DVD release.<br /><br />This is a must buy because:<br /><br />1. It includes all the hits (No ordinary love, smooth operator, cherish the day, kiss of life, by your side, soldier of love and more!!)<br />2. Newer album cuts like IN ANOTHER TIME and BRING ME HOME sung live!! Sade breathes new life onto CD recordings! Hearing these songs sung live truly connects you with her. Whatever message she tries to give through her music comes right through you, into your veins, your heart and your soul!<br />3. The VISUALS are absolutely stunning. Sophie Muller is a goddess and Baz Halpin is a genius, you get to see why! Sade, Muller and Halpin put the best visual and lighting show along with Sade's ethereal and timeless music.<br />4. The BAND. The band is truly magnificent. Stuart's sax, Andrew's piano and Paul's guitar and the lovely backing vocalists!!<br /><br />I could go on and on. Personally I can't wait for this DVD to come out!! Its going to be more exciting than LOVERS LIVE!

B004RZGUBM|5.0|I own several of these Compplete Works of ..., but this is my first experience with Delphi Classics.  All of the works (which include journal articles and biographies of Dickens) have hyperlinks and they worked perfectly.  Several times while reading Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol I went to look at some other things inside the work and always managed to get back to the spot I left.  This is an exceptional work perfectly suited to the Kindle.

B004LROUW2|5.0|I found this book on my local library, and was intrigued by the name, being both student of Japanese, and a fan of Orson's 1984. I got it for the Kindle, expecting perhaps something closer to 1984, but what I found was a intriguing fantasy history that managed to keep me on my toes for a long while. I read it quite fast, considering the amount of work hat I have nowadays.<br /><br />You can probably describe this as some kind of urban fantasy, that includes both the worries and the anxieties of normal everyday day people making a living while aspiring to something more, that at some point gets twisted into the fantastic world of 1Q84. Beware, once you enter the cat-town, you may never leave.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game! just getting started- seems pretty easy to understand and User friendly. One complaint is not giving options when you must have the dollars to complete a task....don't like to be forced to miss tasks or portions of the game....why not give other options for those players that can't or don't wish to spend real money? Just saying.....

1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs was a boor, a bully and a manipulative control freak. He was also a visionary who stood at the intersection of technology, culture and consumer marketing and almost single-handedly pulled the rest of us into the future he imagined. Jobs and the brilliant teams he assembled reinvented the consumer experience in personal computing, animated movies, music, telephony and portable digital devices.  In the process he created what is currently the world's most valuable company.<br /><br />Most of the information in this book is common knowledge to anyone who bought a computer or read a magazine over the past three decades.  It's all here, from the creation myth of Apple's birth in a Silicon Valley garage, the launch of the Mac, Jobs being bounced by Apple's board in favor of John Sculley, the very productive years in the wilderness running Pixar and Next, culminating in the triumphant return to Apple and the dazzling run of iproduct successes.<br /><br />The book makes clear why Jobs flourished in business.  He knew exactly what he wanted to accomplish, and knew how to attract top notch people to execute his ideas.  Besides seeing the big picture, but could dive down to the tiniest detail, a rare combination.  He wasn't afraid to bet the business to make a great product or reverse direction to improve a lesser one.  Despite the abuse he heaped on his closest associates, they stayed loyal to his vision of making integrated products that tightly controlled the user experience.  Jobs often said that his greatest creation was the development culture he birthed at Apple.<br /><br />Genius is harder to explain than business success.  Jobs had an intuitive, almost mystical ability to visualize the direction of consumer technology, along with the drive and charisma to turn his insights into cool products.  He was tuned into product design from an early age, and a fanatic quest for the perfect form in all its manifestations drove him his entire life.  Although young Jobs had a hippie ethos, being into Zen, vegetarianism, rock music, among other things, he also displayed a sort of emotional Tourette's: he would say in an unfiltered way exactly what he thought about anything the instant he thought it.  This saddened his close friends.  It should have sunk his career, and almost did, but he combined it with an instinctive sense of other's needs, along with a ruthless ability to use what he saw to get what he wanted. He was a Zen master of intermittent reinforcement, the most sophisticated form of human manipulation and the most difficult to resist. Given his drive, his manipulative abilities and his genius at mass communication (he created several of the most brilliant ad campaigns of the last fifty years) we are perhaps fortunate he didn't decide to go into politics.<br /><br />The people who worked with Jobs or competed against him, such as Bill Gates, describe his actions but are less good at making us feel what they felt in his presence.  I wish Isaacson had spent more time with the women in his life, especially his first real love, Chrisann Brennan, with whom he had a daughter, Lisa, with Lisa herself, with his significant girlfriends and with his wife Luanne, who is well regarded by Isaacson, but not pushed to reveal much about living for two decades with a man widely regarded as impossible on his best days.  After being diagnosed with cancer Jobs became a little more vulnerable and reflective, but still continued to treat the world as an obstacle to his vision of what it might become if only people would fall in line with his will.<br /><br />Given his business and product successes, Isascson's assessment that Steve Jobs was the Thomas Edison or Henry Ford of his time seems valid.  Culturally, his legacy is less certain.  Walk down the streets in any city and see all the people plugged in to their Apple devices, minimally engaged with their environment.  Apple promotes its products as empowering, but they are empowering in thesolipsistic way that fantasy games are:  you are captain of your digital ship, but navigating in your head is not the same as navigating on the seas of real life.  The kind of closed systems architecture Jobs insisted on developing may not be the best model for a sprawling, multi-cultural democracy where people can only go forward by forging messy compromises.  The asocial self-absorption of jacking into to your personal apps and playlists while the world swirls around you may be the darker but truer legacy of Jobs' monomaniacal genius.solipsistic way that fantasy games are:  you are captain of your digital ship, but navigating in your head is not the same as navigating on the seas of real life.

B004G5ZY7E|2.0|I actually stopped reading this book after about half way through. It started out promising, then several story lines that were introduced which made no sense; it never got back on track. The action never gained any momentum, or expactation for that matter, and I lost interest in the characters. Harry Hole seemed a bit one dimensional and the others never picqued my interest.<br /><br />If you are a Steig Larson fan, no need to worry. I don't this guy will make a dent anytime soon.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This is a must have for any lynch fan! a very cold and dark and strange film. there is great deal of surrealism and absurdism in this lynch classic. Im not sure if it is worth the 70$ price tag new or the 35$ used though because i picked up the ERASERHEAD 2000 at a local movie trading company  (who will remain anonymous for his review)  for about 10$ so i would advise looking around before coughing up 35$-70$ on a dvd  (that isn't blue ray,even if it was thats still expensive). For all those new to this Lynch film one thing to keep in mind in this film is that every bizarre event that happens is from the main character perception. What he(and we the audience)see is all his surreal and bizarre interpretation of what happened in his own reality. When the film is viewed like this( in my opinion )it is easier to comprehend. 5 stars even if it is almost near 35$ used or 70$ new. ITS STILL A MUST HAVE CLASSIC!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|why is the guy in the movie wearing a scorpion in the back of hes jacket?<br /><br />the movie is about a methaphor of a scorpion<br /><br />it goes like this<br />One day a scorpion is hanging around the side of a stream. A frog happens by on his way across the stream. The scorpion cannot swim so he stops the frog and asks if he can climb on his back for a ride across the water.<br /><br />\\"Do you think I am crazy?\\" The frog says. \\"If I let you on my back, you'll certainly sting me and I'll sink in the water and die.\\"<br /><br />The scorpion replies, \\"hey just think about it for a second, I can't swim. If I sting you, then you'll die and I'll sink and die too.\\"<br /><br />The frog thinks for a second and decides that makes sense, so he proceeds to give the scorpion a ride across the stream.<br /><br />About half way across the stream, the scorpion stings the frog. The frog screams \\"What are you doing? Why did you sting me? Now I am going to drown and die and you are going to sink and die too.\\"<br /><br />The scorpion says \\"because is my Nature.\\"
B00005LOUP|1.0|I'm supposed to write a review on this and I don't know why. I do not know what this is or what it is about and I don't recall ever purchasing it.
0439023513|4.0|Let me begin by stating that I enjoyed reading this trilogy and would recommend the story to readers of all ages. That said, I feel in Mockingjay the author falls flat in a few areas.<br />1)Character development. Peeta, Finnick, and Katniss are the only characters in the story who are three dimensional. I would have liked to see more of Haymitch but as the story is written, he never really rises above his role as the drunken mentor of Peeta and Katniss. Also, there should have been more to President Snow. He was too much the quintessential cartoon villain. A cardboard cutout with no depth whatsoever.<br />2) Katniss inner monologue is a constant frustration as she continues to misunderstand the events taking place around her. Even the target audience of the trilogy(12-17)must find her inability to realize what is happening  exasperating.<br />3)There isn't much going on in the story and when the action does pick up, it tends to be all too brief and gratuitously violent.<br />On the plus side, the author skipped the Hollywood ending in favor of a more realistic conclusion. Some reviewers have lambasted Collins for doing so but I found it to be a refreshing alternative to the ordinary Disneyesque pablum so prevalent in today's novels.<br />In short, the trilogy is a good but not great story, which is sad because with a little added effort, it could have been something really special.
1439153663|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Even though it was a book that was read for a book group.  I enjoyed the character and setting of this novel.  The ending did somewhat let me down.  I also recommended this book to my library for the book group packages that the provide to patrons of the library.

B007LB1O3I|5.0|This is one of Madonna's best albums in a while. If you like ballads or slower songs you get a couple of them here and if you love up-beat dancey songs you'll love this album even more! Some of it is a little dark but I like it because Madonna really talks about things she was going through at the time like her divorce with Guy Ritchie. Some say her vocals aren't as strong as they could have been on this but I think she still sounds absolutely wonderful on this album. The Deluxe Edition is the best because it comes with a few extra songs/remixes! :)

B005ELZNH0|3.0|So I can get 20 Miles albums for under 40 bucks.  That is quite a deal I admit.  But who buys music that way?  I own too many of these albums (and the Prestige and Birth of Cool to boot) to buy these, but even if I didn't I don't think this is the way to buy important, deep music.  This sounds like it would be enticing to someone who owned Kind of Blue, didn't own a lot of jazz and wanted more.  Fine.  But how do you absorb 20 albums?  You go from zero to a hundred on the Miles highway, but there are a lot of other jazz roads to follow.  Sounds like the typical American idea: if a whopper is a good idea, let's super size it and make it a triple whopper.  Music as commodity, not music as art.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is incredible. Very addicting. challenging but very fun to play. Hours of  entertainment. One of the best out there.
B0000024SI|5.0|Well, this is certainly the best album to come out of 1965 (though it's probably actually tied with Rubber Soul- if I remember there's a difference between the American and British versions of Rubber Soul and I prefer the American one despite the shorter length... but this isn't about the Beatles!)<br /><br />It should be noted that, despite how much I love this album, I have no problem admitting that the amount of creative lyrics presented throughout Highway 61 Revisited are probably WAY out of my league.  I can't really explain the meaning behind any of these songs, though the truth is, the way I listen to music is that I interpret lyrics in a way that relates to how *I* think about them and disregard the meaning.  I feel this same with *all* my favorite artists.  Oh well.  With that rubbish out of the way, let's get started!<br /><br />\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is the song that radio stations have been beating into our eardrums for several years now.  Actually I can't remember the last time I heard it on the radio.  Every time I turn on the radio I hear Katy Perry, Pink and that sort of exciting and danceable pop *snickers*.  Anyway, I think I speak for several people when I say every single lyric of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is basically memorized in my head.  I bet you're sitting out there reading this and can claim to having memorized every word of this amazing song (whether intentionally or not since you've probably heard it several hundreds if not thousands of times).  Oh, and remember what I say about about interpreting lyrics in MY own way?  Either it's because of stubbornness or shallowness, but I definitely like to think of the line \\"How does it feel to be on your own, with no direction home\\" as a moment of freedom and the excitement and confusion that soon follows.<br /><br />\\"Tombstone Blues\\" mentions all sorts of lyrics about Paul Revere, Jack the Ripper, the commander in chief, geometry and who knows what else.  What's especially interesting is how it actually has a chorus with the same phrase repeated several times, something Dylan normally avoided implementing.  I've always believed he avoided lyrical repetition because he's too darn good at being a walking talking dictionary so such a tactic is beneath him, heh.  Anyway, you'll definitely hear the line \\"mama's in the factory she ain't got no shoes, daddy's in the alley he's lookin for food, I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues!\\" more than once, that's for sure.  My favorite line is \\"the sun's not yellow- it's chicken!\\"  Whatever encouraged him to come up with THAT hilarious line is beyond me!  Then again, maybe it's not supposed to be funny.  Or then again, I'm inadvertently taking it out of context anyway thanks to the complexity of the lyrical matter Dylan unleashed with this album.<br /><br />\\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" is a slow-moving blues tune with tasty piano arrangements.  Normally this kind of song would be ordinary but Dylan has that magical ability (perhaps due to the sound of his voice alone) to make it rather interesting and worth your time.  Plus his voice sort of sails in a unique way after the verse.  \\"From a Buick 6\\" is a rocker about a woman who apparently will do anything for her man!  Gotta love those types of women!  \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" is absolutely incredible for one thing- the atmosphere.  An *enormous* atmosphere that's so powerful and haunting... and imaginative.  Doesn't it make you think about prisoners walking slowly down death row, or a detective in a smoky room working on a case alone?  A song that stands out drastically I believe.  The best song on the album too.<br /><br />\\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" is slightly similar to \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" in sound but of course, lyrically it's from an entirely different planet.  These lyrics are actually relatable to me and they seem to describe MY family!  Hey that can't be a coincidence!  Well it has to be.  How did Dylan know 45 years ago that my family would turn out the way he describes in this song?  The title song is a fast-paced rocker with memorable vocals.  This song really makes me wanna drive down the highway and just blast it at the highest possible volume level that my speakers will allow, haha.  \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is a slower-paced, piano based tune that's probably more melodic than most of the material here.  I love the final verse melody about going back to New York City.  \\"Desolation Row\\" is hard to interpret.  I guess it's about loneliness and Dylan covers a variety of different situations and people to accurately get this point across (such as Einstein, Robin Hood, mermaids, commissioners, maids and letters).  Let's not overlook the creative acoustic guitar arrangements in the background either- that guitar is just beautiful here.  Another highlight.<br /><br />Overall, Dylan's lyrical masterpiece.  Even surpassing Blonde on Blonde in the lyrics department.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to start reading this trilogy as I am not a Twilight fan and had heard it compared to that. But I (thankfully) gave in and started reading Hunger Games. I couldn't put it down, it is by far one of the best stories I have read, and I've read a lot. Definitely recommend reading it BEFORE you see the movie!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome....learner it fast..lots of fun fun fun fun fun fun....download it now....u will enjoy it like I do every day
B000001DQG|5.0|You know the one thing that's quite unusual about Caribou is how the bonus tracks are organized.  I mean right after the depressingly downbeat \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" and the tragic and sad story of a man who walks into a bar and shoots several people in \\"Ticking\\", we're treated to a more upbeat and positive atmosphere with Elton's cover of \\"Pinball Wizard\\".  Right after the grim nature of \\"Cold Highway\\" that mentions a story concerning a dangerous road where one of Bernie's friends was killed, we're treated to the upbeat and happy \\"Step Into Christmas\\".  After this song -if you happen to have your CD on repeat- it goes back to the beginning and \\"The Bitch Is Back!\\"  The order of the tracks is just really strange, haha.<br /><br />Well to be honest with you, perhaps since I love everything Elton John has done in the 70's anyway (with the exception of the disastrous disco sellout that is Victim of Love which I pretend doesn't exist) I truthfully can't find any really major faults with Caribou.  While it's true the average music fan would find tracks such as \\"Grimsby\\" and \\"Dixie Lily\\" as pure filler, the gigantic Elton John fan in me believes otherwise!  These are just innocent, colorfully arranged simplistic country songs that are actually totally appropriate for the month I'm writing this review- mid-April when the flowers are growing and spring is in full blossom.  In the case of \\"Grimsby\\", you can definitely tell it's a rushed effort thanks to the lazy way Elton sings the chorus.  When you buy the remastered version of Caribou, you will read that the band only had a little more than a week to make the entire album.  With THAT in mind, isn't it quite fascinating that the music is as good as it is?<br /><br />I used to HATE \\"The Bitch Is Back\\".  It took many years for me to warm up to the horns and the funky style that seemed unnatural to me for the longest time.  I love it now.  Funny how our tastes can change so dramatically as we grow up.  \\"Pinky\\" is awonderful ballad with... oh alright I'll put aside my Elton fanboy ways and admit that the arrangements are fairly standard.  I still love it though.  The chorus is especially beautiful with the pleasant \\"ahhhhh\\" humming in the background that's an Elton trademark.  I love that sound.  I never could figure out if that's Elton singing that way or another band member.  Nobody can understand a single word from \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\" and guess what?  According to the notes you're not supposed to, haha.  I thought it was German!  I don't know WHAT it is- all I know is that the chorus is wonderful and reminds me of sitting outside an Italian pizza place.  \\"You're So Static\\" contains a REALLY good chorus- it repeats quite a bit, but I love it anyway.  The horns give it character.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen the Saucers\\" is another example of quality writing that should have been more well-known when you listen carefully to the vocals- they are definitely hit-worthy.  \\"Stinker\\" used to BE really stinky to me but now that I've warmed up to the funky horns that occupy a good portion of the album, I don't find a track like this nearly as annoying as I once did.  It's probably a couple minutes overlong, though.  We all know the hit \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" and I'm probably the only person on the planet that believes the verse melody and the dramatic and decorative piano arrangements are the moments that *make* this song so darn good.  Most people will say this is Elton's way of warming up before getting to the chorus, but the way Elton stretches his range really is a fascinating thing.  Who knows, perhaps being left-handed makes me think the wrong way, lol.<br /><br />\\"Ticking\\" as I mention above, is a compelling song with lyrics that seem to predict the troubled minds of the young generation and the way they create unexplainable violence with guns and revenge.  Back in 1974 lyrics like these were probably considered an unlikely tragedy but nowadays?  This stuff happens all the time, I'm afraid.  Just turn on the news and see.  I love how Elton REALLY gets into it- as the song rolls along even the piano playing takes an aggressive and angry turn as Elton builds his emotions and expresses the surreal lyrics as chillingly as possible.  A VERY haunting song.<br /><br />The bonus tracks... well I definitely like \\"Step Into Christmas\\" the most.  It seems lately that it's cool to bash a song like this.  I'm not sure why either.  I mean, when Christmas comes around I always though \\"Step Into Christmas\\" was right up there with a certain John Lennon and Emerson, Lake & Palmer song in terms of \\"Best Christmas songs by rock artists\\" but I guess most people think otherwise these days.  I love it though.  \\"Step into Christmas, the admission is free-e-e!\\"  I never really thought too highly of Elton's version of \\"Pinball Wizard\\".  He seems to take his vocal range to a REALLY unnatural and helium-voiced level and it's definitely not as good as the Who's version, that's for sure.  \\"Cold Highway\\" has very good vocals and \\"Sick City\\" has a memorable chorus for the way the jazzy arrangements give it some juice.<br /><br />Overall, I love Caribou, and it's honestly only one small step down in quality compared to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think this game is so awesome I think its really addicting and fun and if you already own this you no its awesome
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. I play it on my Kindle Fire and I have no problems with it.  Fun game.
1612130585|4.0|As a 50+ something I picked this book up in my local supermarket and after having read the back bought it believing it to be a romantic love story.  There was nothing to suggest it was anything otherwise.  So I started to read it. I have to say I think it is absolutely outrageous and if I had known I would never have read it thoroughly from cover to cover in two days!!!
B000JMLKCG|5.0|Rather than repeat tired platitudes about this established literary classic, I'll simply describe my reaction to 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'.  It made me nervous and stressed, dreading the next awful event that would follow the painful scene I had just finished, and sure enough, another calamity would promptly occur.  Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading.  That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life. I thought I had read this book in high school fifty years ago, but if I really did, it affected me less then than it did now.  Finishing the last page with a sense of relief, I gratefully turned to Anthony Trollope for my next read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm NOT a reader.  I've been out of high school for 20 years now and the only books I have read are the books in the Twilight series.  (Please don't hate me because of that!)  I am really into the Hunger Games books!  I couldn't put the first one down and had to read it before I saw the movie.  (LOVED THE MOVIE TOO!)<br /><br />I'm now on book three, but so far book two is my favorite.  GO READ THIS BOOK![[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]
0060872675|5.0|My husband has read nearly every Terry Pratchett book out there and insisted we get this for our 3 year old. So glad we did... he loves the book and within the span of a week has nearly memorized the whole book. Fun book for kids of Pratchett fans! Yes, you've already read it if you've read his other books, but way more entertaining in this format for kids.
0786955570|5.0|Like many here, I played D&D when I was younger but have drifted away and lost touch with most of the people I used to play with. My wife recently mentioned that she would like to give D&D a try, and I figured that this game would be an excellent way to dip our toes in without the need for a dedicated group of players, a huge time commitment and hundreds of pages of rulebooks. I ended up getting it as a birthday present a few days ago, and so far it has lived up to expectations.<br /><br />The best thing for us is that everyone plays a hero; there is no need for a DM. In fact, the game can even be played solo, though that takes most of the fun out of it. The dungeon is generated randomly using interlocking tiles, and monsters and traps are controlled by the players using simple scripts. There are also no character sheets; everything is kept track of using cards and little cardboard counters. This is a dungeon crawl plain and simple with very little actual role-playing involved. You can go up to level 2 within an adventure, but there is no continuity between adventures. You simply pick one of the pre-defined characters and keep slaying monsters until you meet whatever the particular adventure's objective is, then pick a new adventure in no particular order and start again next time. While this limits the complexity of the game quite a bit, it also makes it totally \\"pick up and play\\" and eliminates the logistical nightmares of getting together a dedicated group of players on a regular basis. You can simply have a \\"game night\\" and whoever shows up grabs a character and jumps in.<br /><br />From our experience with our first couple of adventures, this game can be quite challenging. Your characters are subjected to a huge amount of punishment, including constant attacks from monsters and \\"encounters\\" that are almost always something nasty. Hit points become a precious resource to be jealously husbanded, and healing surges (which are like continues in a video game) go quickly. If even one player dies with no healing surges left, it's game over. However, you can adjust the difficulty by changing the number of healing surges that you start out with. For our first couple of games we decided to go with 3 instead of the recommended 2, which turned out to be a good idea.<br /><br />The game box itself is massive and contains a ton of components, including 41 heavy card stock dungeon tiles, 42 plastic miniatures (including a massive skeletal dragon), and 200 Encounter, Monster and Treasure cards. Everything seems to be high quality, and though the miniatures are mass-produced plastic and probably not the highest quality miniatures available, they get the job done nicely. I'm sure if you were so inclined you would be able to use these figures and tiles for a regular D&D campaign. There is also a ton of room for additions to the standard rules and adventures included in this box. In addition to the 13 adventures included in the box, there are a number available for free download from the Wizards of the Coast website. You can also make up your own fairly easily, and the basic rules are simple enough that you can add your own house rules to suit your tastes.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this product. If you are a hard core roleplayer you will probably complain that this is too simple, but for people like me the fact that it is simple and self-contained is a big part of its appeal. I can happily report that my wife, who has never played this type of game before, has enjoyed herself every time we've played and is excited about trying out more adventures. We will be getting a ton of use out of this.
0743277708|5.0|I remember when I first picked up this book to read it, a lot more years ago than I want to admit.  :-)  I really wasn't expecting to finish reading it and only picked it up because I didn't have anything else to read at the time.  I need to have my nose stuck in a book as often as possible.<br /><br />This book was a great and pleasant surprise!  I read mine so many times that it fell completely apart, so I'm glad I finally will be able to replace it. I wish it had the same cover, since I tend to get sentimental about things like that, but still, I am happy.  I haven't yet received it in the mail, but I am so looking forward to reading it again, even though I DO have other books to read this time! I completely recommend this book to anybody.
0741470314|4.0|I purchased the kindle version and devoured it in 2 nights.  The early chapters contained much information about MJ's life in Vegas with his bodyguards in 2007-08 (containing warm stories of his close contact with his children in small everyday occurences and his great love for his \\"little ones\\"), but then drifted off course somewhat (from one reviewer's information apparently the author and the bodyguards had disagreements).  The book appeared to pick up with episodes of Michael's life of which most of us who have researched for the past few years were aware, inserting small items about the 2007-08 bodyguards to flesh out particular details.  The overriding theme, to me, was that Michael was so very vulnerable and trusting in decision making, considering others to be trusting as well, much to his detriment. The author points to the three biggest mistakes in Michael's decision making, (1) paying the settlement in 1993, (2) helping the Arvizos (and agreeing to Bashir's interview in 2003), and (3) trusting Conrad Murray, in that order.  Personally, I feel Murray's involvement (whether at the behest of Jackson or AEG) was the worst of the three for obvious reasons.  It also seems the author does not hold many members of the Jackson extended family in high regard, pointing out the fact that Michael supported most of them from a young age, which of course carries over to a great sense of responsibility for their welfare into adulthood.  This seems well borne out by the siblings' sudden climb back into the spotlight after years of ignomy, including misinformed interviews, tribute shows and now a J4 tour.  But back to the book, Dr. Moriarty takes us through those terrible trial years (in my opinion not enough detail in this area) and the aftermath when everyone with an axe to grind sued Michael, some suits still in Estate litigation, due to his \\"reputation to settle\\" and avoid conflict.  He was a personal slot machine to the vultures and greedmongers around him, even though he tried to escape the US, but the lawsuits followed.  That coupled with the pressure to tour, both from family and promoters,  the threat of losing Neverland, the aborted auction of his belongings, and his unwanted affiliations with certain \\"managers\\", \\"charlatans and \\"wannabe's\\", surely took an immeasurable toll on his naive, innocent soul.<br /><br />I believe Dr. Moriarty's self-published book, though repetitious in part, is a sincere attempt to provide information on the years 2005-2009 (which incidentally could not be gleaned from either Jermaine's or Latoya's books as they had little contact with Michael during this time), which Michael was attempting to pull his life together, while having total care of 3 small children and despite his nomad existence with little, if any supportive contact from his extended family who claimed, post June 25, 2009, to have known so much, and yet have divulged so little.  It's a shame that this wonderful man died alone at the hands of a murderous fiend, when it was so easily avoidable if just a few who have since June 25th claimed such love and loyalty to the man Michael had been available, comforting and loyal to him in the months leading up to the TII concert.<br /><br />As Dr. Moriarty and Tom Mesereau have stated so succinctly Michael was never the same man after the trial, although given time and sufficient assistance from someone, anyone, who could reach out and touch him, he would have achieved all the plans he had in place.<br /><br />I, too, believe that Michael Jackson's legacy is secure and should be celebrated whenever fans and supporters have the chance, through song, mentoring the less fortunate, and of course carrying on his great charitable endeavors around the world.  Let's ask ourselves when in doubt:  \\"What would Mike do?\\"  We will have our answers.

Thank you for great service.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|Rite- Stravinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps / Revueltas: La Noche de los Mayas is a 2010 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela under the direction of Gustavo Dudamel. Dudamel truly understands the music of Stravinsky so listening to this recording is true bliss. Having not listened to Silvestre Revueltas (prior to this recording); I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended. 5/5.

1612130283|5.0|Not the kind of book I normally read (.James Patterson is my fav.) But after reading all the hype I bought it....  DAM!!!  Buy this book & order the  2 others!!  I read the 500+ book in 48 hours!!  It should come with a money back  guarantee, you won't want to return it!!!!!!
B00756GKBA|5.0|If Madonna was 20 years younger, people would be praising this album left and right. Ageism prevents this album from becoming a true Madonna classic. In any case, Turn Up The Radio should have been the first single. Other great songs include Falling Free and Love Spent.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I rented this once b/c of Christina/ Cher.  I didn't expect much..  I now own the DVD, the CD & couldn't be happier!!  Christina is a great actress & it was a well put together cast!

B00133KFGW|5.0|It is a heartwarming story about an orphan boy. He was born as the result of a chance encounter between musicians who fell in love. The parents become separated by twists of fate but in his heart he believes he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him and pursues that feeling.<br /><br />The film is charming and pulls on the heartstrings of the viewer. It's directed to your inner child. Plausibility doesn't come into play but rather we are encouraged to surrender to pure fantasy. We are also provided with an \\"escape from realism\\" that brings us down. It raises our spirits, giving us an emotional boost that most of us can benefit from.<br /><br />All three of these actors were perfectly suited for their parts Freddie Highmore (\\"August\\") Jonathan Rhys Meyers (\\"Louis\\") and Keri Russell (\\"Lyla\\"). Supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances as well. The music is incredible.<br /><br />Will most definitely be on my favorite list. Have watched it repeatedly....LOVED IT!! every time. Even purchased the music which I rarely ever do.<br />I am an avid movie buff and don't really know how I managed to be so late discovering this awesome story.<br /><br />Don't believe in giving away too much detail and ruining it for the next potential viewer. Just watch and enjoy.

B001HN6922|3.0|The Cars series is definitely the weakest of the excellent movies put out by Pixar. I think it has more to do with what they have to work with. There's only so much you can do with a car.<br /><br />Although, visually as usual it is fantastic and the details are tremendous. If you read Japanese, you'll get a kick out of the names of the shops during the opening race held in Japan. Plus kudos on getting the colloquial spoken Japanese right.<br /><br />I just found the whole spy plot a bit silly and way too much focus on Cars 2 on Mater. He's goofy for sure but I wouldn't consider him the character you'd want the focus on.<br /><br />The extras are nice. You get a Toy Story short where the toys create a Hawaiian vacation for Ken & Barbie. There's also an Air Mater short as well as in the previews is one for a Pixar movie called Planes coming out in spring 2013. The tie-in is obvious as it looks basically like Cars in the air. What's next--Boats? I'm sure a cute but grumpy little tugboat will bond with a snazzy speedboat in that one.

The music is great, but the CD was packaged in a thin cardboard sleeve instead of a jewel case like other CD's. Both of the Zac Brown CD's that I purchased were cheaply packaged, so apparently it's a \\"Zac Brown thing\\". The Billy Currington CD purchased at the same time was in a jewel case.

It just won't give you aces or low cards to start piling off. It's just real frustrating sometimes!

0545123291|4.0|I found that Linger was quite different from Shiver. I absolutely loved Shiver and couldn't wait to read Linger. However, I found the books different. That didn't stop me from enjoying the second novel, though.<br /><br />*some spoilers*<br /><br />First of all, I was pretty disgusted by Cole. Maybe that makes me heartless and evil, since he apparently suffers from depression. Toward the end of the novel, he finally started to change. I started seeing him in a different way and I finally started giving him a chance. He wasn't a character that was engaging to me, though.<br /><br />Also, it was hard for me to get into the multiple points of view. It was very confusing at times, especially in the beginning. It was hard to get into. Honestly, at times it put me off. But the story itself kept me reading and wanting to know what happened next. I kind of missed Sam and Grace being the only narrators.<br /><br />The ending killed me. I'm waiting for Forever to be transferred to my library. I wish I had it with me already! I love Grace and Sam together and I can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Even though I found Linger to be different than the previous novel, I still enjoyed it. I found a lot of the writing beautiful and haunting. There were some parts that really got to me and made me pause. When Victor was killed...that was really horrible. That was probably the worst part of the book, besides the very end. I adore wolves and can't imagine anyone killing one.
030758836X|5.0|I loved Gillian Fylnn's other two books so I was thrilled to get a chance to review \\"Gone Girl\\" through the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />Even though I loved this book and ultimately gave it 5 stars, it did take me several chapters to really become invested in and intrigued by the story and characters.  I think it just takes a while for Nick and Amy's story to unfold and to eventually discover that Amy's disappearance is not what it seems.  The reader knows something is \\"up\\" right away but has no idea what direction things are going...we know that Nick is hiding something...what??<br /><br />I can't write too much else because I don't want to risk any spoilers, but this book keeps you guessing and will keep you up at night reading.  This is definitely NOT you average who dunnit and many people will be surprised!
044024630X|1.0|I have read several Reacher novels and this was truly a disappointment<br /><br />The writer has his main character spending time eating burgers, wandering around  train tracks, fighting with a local family that btw, never comes to a resolution.<br /><br />I typically buy a novel for my commute and usually finish a Reacher novel in 1 or 2 flights but this took 2 flights and several nights at home<br /><br />My biggest complaint was the amount of time spent going into the smallest detail of whatever he was doing or looking at<br /><br />As one reviewer noted it does fill in the blanks as to how and why he leaves the army<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that I have read much better Lee Child novels and I am really surprised this is rated so highly
1439153663|5.0|This was a beautifully written story with characters that it is easy to fall in love with.  It captivated me and I couldn't get anything done until it was finished. It was certainly one of those books that I was sad to see end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|fifty shades of gray is not just a romance novel. its loving, dark, kinky, suspenseful and refreshingly unique story. I finished all three books in a week and I am already to go back and read them again.
B005QWJWYC|5.0|the show really maintained a high level of interst, i anticipated seeing the next show. Just enough drama, action and romance which created a well balanced storyline and flow.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Alrighty. My first review got rejected, so I'll try a kinder, gentler version.<br /><br />If you loooooved Twilight, you will want to sleep with this book under your pillow.<br /><br />If you hated Twilight, you are already pre-disposed to dislike this book, but read it anyway so you can properly attack it.<br /><br />If you are sensitive about gratuitous sex, don't read this book.<br /><br />If you are a woman under 18, don't read this book.<br /><br />If you are a guy looking for hints on how to please a woman, don't even THINK about it, dude.<br /><br />Shy, book smart girl meets handsome millionaire.  Handsome millionaire is a control-freak, tries to impose his will (and kinky lifestyle) upon shy girl. Shy girl is in love with millionaire, tries to skirt around the kinkiness and general Neanderthal behavior of the millionaire as well as get to the bottom of the childhood trauma that caused him to be a freak. Fails. Lots of sex. More sex.  Lots of torn foil packets later (read: condom wrappers), the end.<br /><br />It's like a soap opera: implausible and more than a little absurd, but you'll keep reading because that's how soap operas work.  Don't understand the hype at all: it's not the first (or last) book of its kind.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek Sivers' approach to business is so intuitive and out of the box that reading about It is like breathing fresh air.<br />His \\"radical\\" views of business as mechanisms to help other people solve their issues is nice and effective at the time.<br />Not a \\"get rich\\" silly book.<br />It's a very good reading. I recommend it.
B00792EGES|5.0|Wake up America this is real music,a rock band playing their own instruments at the highest level. Look at the crowds AB has overseas! It's time this band and others like it get the recognition they deserve. AB is four of the most talented artists you will ever see and hear. Myles awesome vocals and guitar skills,Tremonti guitar god,Marshall five string bass and and last but not least Flip on drums!
B003MC5N28|1.0|I was very upset, as I did want to read this book.  I received a cover page and then all of the rest of the pages were blank.  I returned it and bought it again, and the same thing.  Very disappointing.
B0002IU988|5.0|This is the one that started it all . Get all five alter bridge cd's and you won't be disappointed all of their songs are awesome not one bad song .If you are a rock/hard rock fan,it doesn't get any better . Mark Tremonti is one of the greatest guitar players period. Don't forget the dvd's you will be amazed how great this band is. Forget stapp, Myles gets my vote !
B00756GKBA|3.0|Ten times better then hard candy, but some songs sound like a five year old wrote them! Hopeful that turn up the radio helps sales ...
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Why would creed ever get back together for any reason ? Myles kicks stapps butt in every way possible ! The songs are much more indepth .
B007V2UGPE|5.0|pretty cool game. kind of reminds me of the army of darkness game app. 5 stars for the addiction!!!! Thanks Glu.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great app. my son loved it. its lots of fun and easy to use. I definitely recommend this app.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|First review was snarky, then they sent out an update. So far the app appears to be working in ICS!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is really fun for any one. of. any age. and I'm 16..... this game is soo much better than tap zoo ir tap safari. I recommend it for everyone
B000OVLBF8|2.0|Okay, it wasn't the worst film ever, but there was nothing about it that I would call good.  The acting and script were marginal.  The script was about as predictable as it gets.  The special effects seemed pretty low budget, and it had none of the feel fo the original comic book.  This Ghost Rider seemed to have no edge to him, and the fight scenes were weak because of their low budget.  Maybe its best trait was how forgettable it was.  At least it left no scars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|like castleville but not<br />you aren't so dependantt on the social meedia aspect. you can play it without friends just fine.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is in my top 3 games Cuz is sooo cool. You have to complete games that are available and need the necessary points to unlock others.;)
0061914177|2.0|The advice in this book can be summarized as follows:<br /><br />1) Quit your boring job.<br />2) Create a blog about your passion, and dedicate a smallish percentage of your time to creating very high quality, engaging content.<br />3) Dedicate a largish amount of time to promoting your personal \\"brand\\" by commenting on other blogs, forums, and newsgroups related to your passion as well as publicizing your blog through social media.<br />4) Your new status as an online guru will result in money making opportunities.<br /><br />The challenges of this plan are unfortunately myriad.  As Gary concedes fairly late in the book, most people (by definition) aren't able to create the engaging content that's going to establish themselves as a leader in the field, especially if you're only dedicating a small percentage of your time to its production. You'll be lucky to make $30K a year working 80hr weeks following the plan Gary says, but hey, better to making $30k doing something you love than $60k doing something you hate.  I guess it's up to the reader to decide.<br /><br />The most glaring omission is almost any discussion of numbers at all. There are plenty glorified shout outs like \\"Suzy created a blog about sewing and now she's crushing it!\\". How many monthly visitors does Suzy have? How much money is Suzy making? How is she making it? All these questions go unanswered.  Gary's own blog piggybacked off an existing and rapidly growing wine business started by his father, but it's very hard to tell from the book how much his blogging activity has helped (or hindered for that matter) its success. The world of online blogging is fiercely competitive and saturated with content. Standing out isn't easy. It would be interesting to know what percentage of full time bloggers are able to make a living off their labor.<br /><br />The most eye opening assertion came late in the book. Gary mentions someone who had worked on his blog for two years without establishing much of a following. His response? These things take time! At the very least, that makes Gary's plan an extremely time consuming and expensive experiment. I really wish he included advice on how to create a \\"weekend blog\\" that would shed some light on whether you have the right stuff.  Maybe he needs to team up with the folks over at \\"The Lean Startup\\".<br /><br />If you want to get fired up about using social media to create a personal brand, this is probably worth a read. If you're looking to \\"cash in on your passion\\", I'd consider a book like \\"The Lean Startup\\" or even \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\" which outline a more nuts and bolts approach to online earning. \\"Crush It!\\" asks us to take too much on faith.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game.  easy to play and you can level quickly.  you create families of four and the more you build the more money you collect.  the only downfall is that it is expensive in game money to expand your land.?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game well its actually more games than just one and I love it. better than any other.
B006YC74E8|1.0|I started the download 3 DAYS AGO IT STILL HASN'T DOWNLOADED, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, ITS MUCH SIMPLER TO GO ON THE INTERNET.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I could not turn app off.  When I tapped screen nothing happened.  There was no way to stop app. Turned off Kindle and a few hours later it was off screen. I have deleted app.
0439023521|1.0|The premise of this book is only mildly clever.  The prose does nothing to keep me engaged.  Suffice it to say that I don't believe anyone will be discussing this as great literature of the early 2000's.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|First time i purchased a movie/ tv season though amazon - product was great and being able to watch online via my amazon account was a huge bonus. Planning on buying all movies this way from now on.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The quality of the downloaded book is excellent.  Noting that it also is free to Kindle owners, I would recommend this book to all who enjoy reading classic literature.
B004I744AS|5.0|We love this dictionary and the best is the translation section. We recommended highly. We use it on iphone and kindle fire.
B0000041Z5|1.0|When I first began listening to this set, I was surprised that such a fantastic orchestra could play music that was so flat and dull. I could see that the music is fantastic and emotional, but Solti limits its qualities by having almost no dynamic or tempo contrast. I would not recommend buying this version - there are others out there that rightfully expose the lyrical and emotional sides of Brahms.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Admirable game. Since it was purchased, should not be bugged about writing a review. Directions for game screen icons descriptions could be better.
B0071MV540|4.0|This movie was funny but it was not the best... Thank goodness I waited for it on DVD.... Eddie Murphy, this wasn't his greatest moments in this movie...you should watch it... Not bad
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. This game DOES NOT asks for really money. It doesnt freeze :). GET IT!!! Add me if could.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Buy this DVD! I'm 45 minutes in and I've been laughing and crying all along. Brian going back to show us the original spot where he hung the add at college for a drummer...the original singer of Smile telling a story about Freddie; He had his head in his hands and said \\"I'm not going to be a Pop star\\"...then lifting himself up and spreading out his hands \\"I'm going to be a legend!\\" If you are a fan, this DVD is worth every penny!
B005M2A4D4|1.0|This is a wonderful show and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the old Doctor Who.  However, the discs were terrible-- they were not the official release (with the blue disc trays) but rather a pirated copy.  Very disappointing.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I could play this forever. I don't know how to describe it but it's amazing. Give it a spin and I'm sure you'll be hooked.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was an entertaining read.  Typical for a John Grisham book, so if you like his stories then i recommend this.  It's easy and quick reading.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It was very fun and VERY addicting at first. But then the timers on most of the stuff went up into the hundreds. I was a bit annoyed but I thought that I would leave it for a bit to see if it was just a mistake. well it didn't work. the timers went up again. I can't even play it anymore because there's nothing for me to do. I would continue to play if it gets fixed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I couldn't wait to get it over with.  It dragged the story far too long. But if you've read the first two, at least this ties everything together... Could have been done in 1/2 the pages tho.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm not a book reviewer....but I am an avid reader who reads across all genres :-). I just finished the trilogy and literally read until I had to put drops in my dry eyes so I could continue!! Before I purchase a book, I read the review...quite a few as to get a good cross reference and then I decide for myself whether or not to take a chance, spend the money, spend my time. I was surprised by so many negative reviews and one in particular. This lady's rant was so long that it began to read like a personal vendetta rather than a book review. Having read many BDSM/erotica books I'm pretty familiar with the wide range of styles and intensity. Fifty Shades is not your typical BDSM novel...it doesn't use every raw word known to man to describe all the body parts...that in itself was refreshing. Ana is not your typical sub, Grey is a Dominant with enough baggage to clog up the Atlanta International Airport. So, from the get-go...this book is different, refreshing and charged with thought provoking scenarios that just keep coming :-). I have to admit that there were a couple of times in the first book that I said to myself, \\"not no, but h*ll no\\"!! I kept reading...so glad I did...for those people that read all three...you will be rewarded with a journey worth taking as it and the characters evolve. Also...in the last book......there is a treasure included by the author that I wasn't expecting....that made me sad the book was over...and I am starting to read the trilogy again since I powered through it the first time and this time I simply want to enjoy. Enjoy!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is challenging and entertaining. The music and sound are a soothing touch, bravo on this one! There are many levels to work through making each one an enjoyable challenge.
1607053888|3.0|I think this book has some really cute bags to sew, but a working knowledge of sewing and pattern reading is essential. One of the reviewers said how confusing the patterns are since they all are traced off on two sided paper, and that is the truth. You have to put the pattern on the window and trace if off on another piece of paper, and it does get confusing. You can also copy the pattern and tape the parts together to make a whole pattern, especially the smaller ones. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I think it would have been much better if the publisher had traced out the patterns only on one side, using another piece of pattern paper or two. I have been sewing for a long time, so I can navigate the patterns without much trouble. I got the book form the library and then decided I'd like to own it.Great ideas, great fabrics, a fun book if you know how to sew. If not.....
0307949486|4.0|One word-AWESOME!<br />This book started out so slow I read the first 3 chapters at bed time to put me to sleep.  Somewhere in the 4th chapter it came alive and I couldn't put it down!  I originally found the the female lead character, Lisbeth Salander to be a silly \\"goth chick.\\"  How wrong I was!  Her character has substance, depth and she's so smart.  I can't wait to read book 2 to see what she does next.  The Vanger story was well laid out with twists, turns and way too many family members.  I knew there was a secret there but could not imagine the depth of the depravity.<br /><br />Writer Steig Larsson was a genius, gone too soon
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great app. I think it is a fun thing to do and I couldn't stop playing it. I am very happy I got it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a very nice adaptation of the classic Mahjong game. The graphics are very nice. The 'hint' feature is nicely done.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|I was disappointed, bored, with this scattered version of the great original 3 movie set. I was wondering who all these extra and unnecessary actors were. The revenge scene looked like a muddled pile of amateur filming.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first book I loved the series. This third book gets a little strange as to how things are happening. A bit of a predictable ending but I like a happy outcome.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|This movie helped me relive some of my childhood. I loved the Muppets as a kid and this movie was just as fun as I remember all the characters.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game. with the clever little puzzles and beautiful graphics and sounds. its very addictive and a little challenging at times. the only issue is after you beat it its really easy to repeat...even though ive played it a few times and its still fun.
B004UID2LC|2.0|HTC Rezound<br />I used this to download my YouTube videos until TubeMate came along. I definitely suggest that you check out TubeMate. There are 2 versions of it, Amazons and Google Plays. Amazons has more advertising, but more options such as connection tweaks. Google Play Store version is called TubeMate Pro, but has no tweaks. Go figure!
B004VFOS2Q|1.0|I agree - Watch out for Region 2 - It doesn't play in the U.S.  I think it's stupid for Amazon to put it on here.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Had to know what was going to happen next!! Loved the whole trilogy and look forward to the final book!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very cute game with nice graphics. Build a community with all the &quot;Ice Age &quot; characters in it. You can share achievements with your facebook friends too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Pretty much a Mario knock off w great controls but maro was a great game. This game has a little different spin, but really fun on galaxy skyrocket.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I would love to rate this higher, but it hasn't been updated in nearly a year. Does anyone know if an update is ever coming for android?
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Michelle Williams really made a splash with this role.  I am too young to remember Marilyn Monroe while she was alive but this movie was a wonderful sneak peak at a small moment in her life.<br /><br />It was also nice to see Emma Watson in something else--it is just a small role but she is just as perky and fun as she was as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing!!!! I have long time I don't get a book this good. I cannot let go, I want more. If you want to read something that help you to forget the real world for a while this is your book. The heroine of the book very strong and I feel connected to her at all time. I can't wait to read the other two.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I think this is my favorite so far. Great songs, Great Butch Walker production. My personal opinion is this the strongest i have heard them. I love it!
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|Venetia is the story of a beautiful but lonely heroine who meets her Mr. Rochester and, despite all odds, wins him in the end.  This is the classic Georgette Heyer novel in that it has all the right ingrediants.  There is a beautiful and intelligent heroine counterbalanced by the slightly dissipated hero who has lost his faith in the world and in love.  Add to this mixture the right number of flawed characters from the mainly just totally self-centered to the down-right nasty and you have a well-rounded tale of love and romance.  But the main spice of this particular Georgette Heyer novel is the repartee between Venetia and her love, Lord Dameral.  From the first stolen kiss to the passionate denouement, this is the electricity that sets this novel apart from her others.  Ths final scene when the lovers are reunited is reminisent of Jane reconciling with Mr. Rochester and demonstrates more passion than is usually seen in her stories.<br /><br />Altogether, this is one of Ms. Heyer's finer novels and is a thoroughly good read from start to end.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I already own the Teenage Dream CD, and bought this one as well.  Definitely worthwhile to have both of them, as the extra tracks are all fantastic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Quests from each character move the game forward in interesting ways. Animal families are made and babies are hatched. Families provide you money for expansions and families. It is fun and you do not need real money or an internet connection to play.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Another great CD from Flo.  Fantastic acoustic performances of some of the best songs off of Ceremonials  and a couple off of Lungs.  I really didn't enjoy her rendition of Jackson at all, but I know that there are fans out there that really enjoyed it, so YMMV.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I am a David Baldacci fan.  I have read volumes about the Camel Club, but not the first book about Camel Club.  This was an excellent opportunity to pick up that missing piece.  Well cone and very much work the it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|i was a little scared at first becaue it was my first try at sparks books, and in my family they are infamous for being depressing. i honestly absolutely love his writing style, and plan on reading more of his books...
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Powerful voice...rhythmic, almost tribal sounding music.  Lyrics have way more depth than the junk you hear on mainstream stations these days...its magical.  When you put this disc in, you FEEL the music.  Florence is amazing, love the emotion she puts into her vocals.<br /><br />I have both her albums to date - and while Ceremonials is a terrific album, Lungs is my absolute favorite.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|i love this game so buy it or die ok yea so lol fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is a must read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it kept me enthralled from start to finish. Be prepared to grab some tissue bc you can't help but cry. I went through a wide range of emotions while reading that went from swooning over Will to getting angry at his decisions to crying over surprises. I haven't cried so much reading one book:-) Slammed is beautifully writtened.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This work was fascinating... Couldn't put the book down.  Plan to get the second of the triligy soon.  Can't believe I waited so long to read it, other than the fact that my reading time has been cut short lately due to heavy work load.
0470913029|2.0|The essence of Paleo Diet logic is ancient human ancestors dined on plants and animals acquired in a hunter-gatherer type of existence, and modern humans should therefor attempt to copy this same type of ancient diet because humans have evolved to function best on this ancient diet.  But evolution is STILL happening.  All living organisms undergo evolutionary changes relative to available food sources. Some bacteria strains have been able to evolve (in just a few generations) the ability to digest foods their ancestors could NOT digest.  Human ability to digest cow's milk is a perfect example of this changing evolutionary digestive phenomenon.  All cavemen could NOT digest cow's milk, but the human ability to digest cow's milk has evolved alongside the human penchant to raise and herd and milk and eat cattle.  Most humans today CAN digest cow's milk.  I love cow's milk.  I also love oatmeal.  I am gonna keep drinking milk and drinking red wine and eating oatmeal and I am gonna dance on the graves of all you Paleo fanatics.  The human digestive system has evolved and it is STILL evolving.  It is now far different than it was in caveman days.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|all timers for crops buisnesses and houses maxed at 439 days and only way I can think to fix it is to uninstall and lose everything.  not a happy person....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an easy to use across my PC and Kindle Fire to save articles from my Pulse app.  Everything works smoothly and is incredibly user friendly.  Plus the options like typing and keeping your own written notes.  This is a Must Have app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. my husband is addicted to it and my daughter thinks its the best thing in the world. I cant wait for the new games to be added. I just wish when you can get a new game I had the points to purchase it. please pit out more updated asap I'm running out of games to play. I also love how bright it is. I play on my kindle fire so the big screen makes its really nice.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The reviews are mixed because either you like to read erotic books or not(my first erotic book). I almost didn't purchase because of the mixed reviews but I did anyways and the bought the other 2.  This book and the other 2 are very xxx-rated and as you read each book it gets more erotic. I really dont know how much more deatil others are wanting; like the book uses \\"down there\\" any other word would be raunchy in my opinion. The story line gets better with each book. I really enjoyed reading them but they are a little repetitive but still kept my interest. Like I said its either you like it or you don't. The one good thing I like is Christian and Ana were committed to each other in all three books and never involved others sexually.
B007K3KO74|4.0|When you spend upwards of thirty dollars on a vinyl album, you expect a certain quality. My first album had oily fingerprints on it, along with ton of scuff makes. That wasn't the main problem though,the biggest problem was on record one, the spindle hole was to small and wouldn't fit the spindle. Out of the hundreds of albums I own this was a first. The replacement still was a tight fit and when I went to take it off I actually had to shimmy it, which caused it to pop and I ended dropping the album. I said this is B S and took a closed pair of needle nose pliers and made the hole bigger. After all that I do have to say the recording is a good one , the highs are high, and the bass line is Kick A--. Madonna is back in the zone, I only wonder why she has to charge so much for her concerts. Check out the Vegas prices, Really?
B005G4YE1G|1.0|Decca no longer includes libretti with their operas, or at least not with this one.  So it is like buying a budget opera, but paying a premium price for it.  I own quite a few Decca operas on CD, but I will no longer be buying them, now that they are too cheap to include a printed libretto.  It is really too bad, because they have quite a few superb recordings.  I will be looking for old, used versions with printed libretti, and will not be buying anything new from them, for as long as they persist in being cheap swine while charging premium prices.<br /><br />I hope you are listening, Decca, because I doubt I am alone in this.<br /><br />Also, Amazon sucks, because they don't tell you this, and they charge you to return it.  Amazon should be better about product information than they are.  I may need to stop buying from them as well, if they are going to treat a good customer this way.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br /><br />Here is the one to order to get the libretto:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000069DB Rossini - Il Turco in Italia / Bartoli, Corbelli, Pertusi, Vargas, Teatro alla Scala, Chailly]]<br /><br />If you look at the picture of the cover there, and look at the picture on the cover on this one, you can see how Decca packages operas without libretti, it seems, with the original picture put on the cover smaller and at an angle.  So you can avoid this problem of buying Decca recordings that do not include libretti, and make sure you get ones with them (if you wish).  Usually, of course, the ones without libretti are cheaper, but it is because you are getting less.  Other brands do not indicate a lack of libretti this way, and Decca, of course, may change what they are doing in the future, but for now, this seems a good way to tell with this brand.  Also, if you are buying in a store, you can read the fine print on the case to tell you if a libretto is included.<br /><br />Edited yet again:<br /><br />Amazon totally sucks with how they attach reviews of one product to other products.  My original review is for:<br /><br />ASIN: B005G4YE1G<br />[[ASIN:B005G4YE1G Rossini: Il Turco in Italia]]<br /><br />But I see that Amazon stupidly is also displaying my review as if it were for the original version that has the libretto:<br /><br />ASIN: B0000069DB<br />[[ASIN:B0000069DB Rossini: Il Turco in Italia]]<br /><br />Beware on Amazon, because the idiots who run Amazon attach reviews of one product to other products.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|\\"The world, as I see it<br />Is a remarkable place...\\"<br /><br />Jason's new album is a remarkable achievement, a song of songs to love. Love to his fellow humans, to families, to women, to nature, to the all-mighty.<br /><br />In the last few days I've been re-listening to the album endlessly, meditating to it, filling my heart with it. It's so beautiful but how could it be otherwise when it comes from a man who realized already that his talent is bigger than him?<br /><br />Yet it seems many people are disappointed, and I totally understand them. After all, as he wrote in \\"everything is sound\\":<br /><br />It's a song that I've forgotten often<br />It doesn't make me wrong<br />Cause we all need the darkness<br />To see the light<br />In our own eyes,<br />COME ON AND SING IT<br /><br />As Jason already wrote in \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" We all are - even Jason is - only humans. Each and every one of us vibrate to different \\"frequencies\\" of love, and every time we don't vibrate to pure love songs like the one in the album do not make sense to us.<br /><br />Again a quote from \\"everything is sound\\", where Jason is calling us to:<br /><br />Set your vibration and undulation<br />To the highest it can go<br />And trust me, hear me<br />If it makes you wanna sing<br />Just sing it<br /><br />Yes, it's hard for many of us to vibrate to only love. We have our daily grinding, some of us goes through life which is full of pain and we embrace it into a misery, believing that they are the same. Jason knows about it, but he also knows that preaching about human choices never changed anyone and that only love can change the world into a better place. So he is there for us, as he wrote in \\"Who's thinking about you now?\\"<br /><br />I want to be the one to help you ignore mister loneliness is heading to your door<br />I'm hoping you can feel me<br />I'm hoping you can feel me in your chest...yeh..<br />I'm hoping that you've noticed how you're blessed...<br /><br />How many of us allow this beautiful love to fill our hearts? How many of us allow those words of true love to be accepted unconditionally?<br /><br />Jason is a prophet of love because he not only knows we are all are, he feels it. everything is love.<br /><br />I will end with quotes from \\"5,6\\" - a masterpiece of musical achievement, filled with truth that seems illogical to many of us in this world were everyone are racing against each other while trying to have more and more. just listen...and be...<br /><br />You can give it all away<br />Give it all and be unstoppable<br />All away<br />Everything is really possible<br />All away<br />You never really owned it anyway<br />It will all fall in place<br />If you just let go.<br />...<br />When you're in the mood, pretty baby<br />Hear just what your heart has to say<br />When the world is turning topside and turvy then you better hurry down<br />To the bottom of your soul<br />Get down, give it all<br />AND BE LOVE<br /><br />Be love...<br />Be love...<br />Be love...

B005COO1X6|4.0|I have to say I really enjoyed this short story.  Of course, you have to realize before buying that it's very short, so don't expect much.  I found it followed King's style nicely, and definitely gets your imagination working.  I would primarily recommend this for young adults, as King added some adult-like language and situations in there that could irk some parents.

1741798981|5.0|The Lonely Planet travel guides are excellent guidebooks for those visiting new countries or cities. In preparation for an upcoming trip, I got both the Scotland book and the London book. Both are fantastic.<br /><br />This book features the top 16 things to see in London, complete with descriptions and photographs of those places. There is a calender that tells you important local events, to help you plan your trip. It lists restaurants and museums, theaters and operas, hotels and places to stay, and all manner of shops. It tells you the best ways to get around. It breaks down the city by sector, such as West End, South Bank, Nottinghill, Greenwich, and so forth. There's a section that helps you plan day trips away from London, if you want to see nearby sights, such as Oxford, Brighton, Windsor, or Bath. It even goes into the architecture, history, art, fashion, music, etc., of the city, so you can learn everything there is to know about London. Best of all, there is a full-sized pull-out map at the back of the book, which is a great help.<br /><br />I'm quite pleased with this book. I've just skimmed through it, but I've learned a great deal. It will make planning our brief trip to London much easier, helping us to decide what we must see and what can wait for the next trip. Without it, we would be utterly lost and wouldn't have a clue where to go, what to see, or how to get there. Five stars and a wholehearted recommendation!

B0079TQHDO|5.0|This is the second book in a page-turning family saga chronicle of 5 books by master story teller, Jeffrey Archer. The story covers the lives of the Clifton and Barrington families who live in and around Bristol in England and is this book is set during the time of the Second World War, both in England and America.<br /><br />The secret of Jeffrey Archer's success, despite his flawed personal history, is that he has always been is one of the best story tellers around. He tells a tale and then weaves another tale around it. The characters, both good and bad, are skilfully crafted and become essential elements in telling his tales. Before you know it you are totally hooked on what is going to happen next.<br /><br />In this book we follow the life of Harry Clifton, the son of a poor docker who transformed himself from an under-achieving child of a poor family to be able to enter Oxford University.  At the start of the Second World War, to get sufficient experience to be accepted for the Navy, Harry leaves Oxford to work as a junior officer on a cargo ship. When the ship is torpedoed by a U Boat in the North Atlantic he is rescued by an American passenger ship. In an attempt to release himself from insoluble personal and emotional problems with the Barrington family back in England, Harry takes the identity of another officer he hardly knows who drowned in the attack. When he arrives in New York under the assumed name he is immediately arrested for murder.<br /><br />Once again Harry's courageous character and intelligence allow him to cope with life in jail and overcome its limitations. While in jail he keeps a detailed diary that will become the secret of his later success.<br /><br />Back in England, his family, and most of the Barringtons are devastated to hear that Harry Clifton has drowned. Harry's mother receives a letter from someone connected with the rescue but because she is illiterate she refuses to open it. His girl friend Emma cannot believe the news and travels to New York to find out what really happened.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in England Emma's unscrupulous father Hugo lives a life of deceit,  insolvency and lies. When his father dies, leaving him to head the family shipping line, Hugo's mismanagement rapidly brings the family fortunes to the edge of insolvency. Meanwhile his son Giles leaves Oxford to join the Army and becomes a hero of the seige of Tobruk.<br /><br />To tell more would spoil the reader's enjoyment of the tale. While I really enjoyed the first book, Only Time Will Tell, I thought this book was better and I couldn't put it down. Once again Archer leaves you with an unfinished dramatic development making one anxious to read the next book straight away. Other reviewers see this as a fault - I find it a challenging way of moving to the next book in the saga. My greatest concern is that it may be over a year before the next book is published, and then Archer will leave me wanting to read the next one....!<br /><br />This is not really a stand alone book as many of the developments depend on a knowledge of the previous book. I highly recommend that if possible your should read Only Time Will Tell before reading this book.travels to New York to find out what really happened.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in England Emma's unscrupulous father Hugo lives a life of deceit,  insolvency and lies.

B00005JN2Z|3.0|Absolutely the best choreographed shootings I have ever seen.  Never ever saw anything like it in real life. Cowboys like that always got shotup or just plain killed.<br /><br />But where is the story. Pro paid killer waxes folks rolling over on his employer, well ok but where is the evil mastermind?  Would have been an easy tie in.<br /><br />Then the train/subway scene at the final close was a joke.  They obviously could not figure out how to end the damn thing.  So the Professional killer walks up to the door and gets shot thru it?  Give me a break, no one in the business does that move.<br /><br />Seller did a fine job and added this to the collection for the alley scene which is the only real life one in the movie, except after taking the two creeps out the cabby who witnessed it all would have to be next<br /><br />Bob
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I saw Il Divo perform during a public television fund drive (where else?), and they sang a very familiar sounding song, but it was in Italian.  Intrigued, I listened closely, and realized it was Chris Isaak's Wicked Game.  Unlike Chris, they did not need to sing falsetto.  I ordered the album and was pleased with the quality of the quartet's voices singing in a variety of languages.  Aside from Wicked Game, the other songs on the album are standard Il Divo.  A critic once commented that no matter how cheesy the song, it always sounds better in Italian.  No one does it better than Il Divo.
B002U6CJCO|4.0|Another Van Damn flick of course.  Keep in mind that the whole series is a reality check of what the government is working towards (believe it or not).  Having 20 yrs service gives one a little insight towards the plan or direction we are headed.  Lots of use of proven bio mechanical technology is used with some poetic license of course but it's commmmmmmmmmming<br /><br />Bought it to add to the collection and the shipper did a good job<br /><br />Bob

B006ISJQ1W|2.0|Say what you will about \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" at least it provoked a response, negative or positive, from the audience and it was true in spirit to Hunter S. Thompson's work.  This film for the most part is two hours of ennui.  It seems to me that they were trying to offer a watered down version of Thompson to attract a larger audience and failed miserably in the process.  This is hands down the worst performance I've seen given by Johnny Depp.  The character he's playing, a besotted writer, should be edgy but Depp renders him as harmless as Bozo the Clown.  The good points of \\"The Rum Diary\\", few that they are, are Richard Jenkins turn as Depp's harried editor, breathtaking Puerto Rico ambience circa 1960, and Amber Heard for just being a dish.  I thought this film laid a box office egg because it was inacessable.  This mainstreaming of Thompson will please no one but the most hearty of Depp fans, my wife.
0439023513|4.0|Great series for the most part.  It really had me hooked from the beginning and through out the series.  Maybe that's why the ending was so bad.  Anti climatic and had me thinking the author must have just got tired of writing.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|In the Kinks song \\"Celluloid Heroes\\" Marilyn Monroe is described as being made of flesh and blood while expected to be made of steel.  \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" pretty much follows that philosophy.  It's not an all encompassing bio of Monroe but a snapshot of the actress at an important juncture in her life.  Set in England in the mid Fifties Monroe wants to eschew her sexpot image and be taken seriously as an actress by starring in Laurence Olivier's \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\".  Sensitive to the demands of Sir Larry Marilyn forms a platonic bond with a third director named Colin Clark to get through the shoot.  Michelle Williams eerily channels Monroe that you are spellbound by her performance.  Though she is not as voluptuous as Monroe Williams captures the essence of the woman humanizing instead of idolizing her.  Kenneth Branagh effectively captures the vanity and tempestuousness of Olivier and still making him a sympathetic character.  Eddie Redmayne as Colin perfectly acts as a conduit to the movie star world.  Good supporting work is offered By Judi Dench as a grand dame of the theatre, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh, and Emma Watson in a grown-up role as a craftsperson on the set.  I'm not what you would call a Monroe afficienado but this film is a real winner.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The meaning of this book is very weird. I mean really, teenagers fighting to the death. Suzanne Collins is really just exaggerating our lives today! Isn't it just a little creepy?<br /><br />Anyway no matter how weird this book is it is very good
B006ZT47O0|5.0|For people new to Epica, I can only describe their music as a mix between symphony, choir, metal, and a front woman with one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. Out of all Epica's albums, I easily rate this the best, with a toss up between, \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" and \\"Design Your Universe\\" for second.<br /><br />For a bit of background about my musical tastes, I'll just say this: Epica is one of only 3 bands I listen to daily like a routine... no more like a drug. The other two are Scale the Summit and Animals as Leaders. I'm into heavier music, but not too heavy, that I can get lost in and just think while my brain follows the patterns of the drums. Instrumentally, this album gave me everything I look for in music, and more, with songs like: Monopoly on Truth, Storm the Sorrow, Requiem for the Indifferent, Deter the Tyrant, and Serenade of Self destruction. With care for the reader's time, I'll spend the remainder of the review with a quick blurb about what the song is and why I like it, without focusing too much on what I think are weaknesses of the album, as I think this would be a waste of time. Art is subjective, and you may listen to the album and think, \\"What was he talking about?\\" All I can really speak on is how and why these songs touched me, with hopes that this will give you something to look forward to when listening to the album!<br /><br />Monopoly on Truth: Starts out with an interesting vocal style, pounding drums, but otherwise kind of a basic metal song... that is until about 3:30 into the song. Then the entire song seems to change. The chorus changes and is sung by a choir, the lyrics are interesting and the feel of the song is just... EPIC. Very memorable and a song I always look forward to on my playlist, not matter my mood.<br /><br />Storm the Sorrow: A slower song, supposed to be the \\"pop\\" song that Epica has a tradition of putting on their albums. See Unleashed for a similar example. What got me about the song is the drastic changein vocals, and the lyrics! I usually don't \\"get\\" poetry, and am terrible at it, but I almost felt on some level that this song was talking about me, which I've never felt about a song before.<br /><br />Requiem for the Indifferent: This song is kind of like the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" for this song, complete with everything down to the in your face chorus and prog-like time changes. The intro to this song is absolutely amazing! (think the acoustic riff from Martyr of the Free Word, combined with the Middle Eastern sounding instruments from Fools of Damnation). The rest of the song doesn't disappoint, if you can get past the politically charged lyrics. It isn't a song I listen to every time I put in the album, but I enjoy it when I do.<br /><br />Deter the Tyrant: When I first heard this song, my very fist though was WOW THAT KEYBOARD! OMG THOSE DRUUUUUUMS! Then when I picked the rational side of my brain up off the floor, all I could think was, \\"Why aren't there more songs like this?\\" Seriously, epic instruments with a very metal feel, a woman singer with a gorgeous voice (A welcome detour from all the screaming, growling, super high pitched guy singers as of late). In short, this is almost everything I ever want from a song unless I'm in the mood for Animals as Leaders, which is a WHOLE different type of music for me entirely.<br /><br />Serenade of Self Destruction: Wow that intro! Seriously, it's getting more intense? Wooo go double bass go! Drive that symphony! And then the intro ends. I forgot to mention the hauntingly beautiful piano at the very beginning. I didn't like how the awesome instrumental stopped in favor of a choir singing lyrics I had a hard time understanding, but when the instruments were there, they were great!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The problem with new authors is that, since the recent trend of self-published e-books, there are so many of them! Having been a wanderer of many a bookstore and library in my youth, the days of casually browsing through shelves of familiar names are all-but over and a beloved past-time has been desaturated with tired angles and rehashed stories.<br /><br />Breaking the mold is one Rebecca Hamilton, a rare gem picked up by Immortal Ink Publishing for her first book, The Forever Girl.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I happened across an interview with her on a blog that was offering a free copy of the book, so I thought I'd give it a shot. With a complete stroke of luck, I ended up winning the copy and did a ridiculous happy dance that lasted all of 3.2 seconds before I realized nobody was there to witness my gloating. (Self-gratification is for suckers)<br /><br />So on to the book itself -<br /><br />The Forever Girl follows the life of twenty-two year old Sophia Parsons, a practicing Wiccan in a small, religious town. Not her religion. Already being set apart as an outsider, things complicate when she can't seem to escape a constant buzzing in her head.<br /><br />From there, Sophia's attempts at deeper understanding lead into a well-crafted world of supernatural beings. Not your typical vampire/werewolf nonsense that has taken paranormal romance by storm and run rampant and streaking through the quad with all the appeal of a sun-burned manatee...<br /><br />Ahem...<br /><br />Instead, Rebecca has woven together an amazing mythology that holds through out the story. Her ability to write tension is some of the best I've ever seen, painting panic with words to accompany the rich, vibrant hues of the world she's crafted.<br /><br />My advice? Pick up this book and call in sick, because it's damned near impossible to find a stopping point.
B007G3H8Y0|3.0|Train tries very hard to be musically versatile on this album, a lot of different instruments and styles.  The song writing isnt that bad musically the songs sound pretty good and catchy!  But what is up with the way Pat is singing all these corny lyrics in his \\"talk a style\\"?  Not just on a few songs either but either that or he just sounds corny! The title song is just stupid along these same lines.  50 Ways To Say Goodbye also sounds so dumb the way he sings it. He should have just sang the songs and forgot all that!  In fact the songs I like are the ones he just sang like Sing Together which is a little like Hey Soul Sister (but slower, a ballad).  This one could be a hit!  I also like We Were Made For This, another nice ballad that builds up to a rocking guitar solo and than slows again at the end with some Scottish pipes thrown in for good measure!  The musical diversity is quite impressive.  When The Fog Rolls is another nice ballad!  It's just too bad these are few and far between! Actually I like Bruises too, but I just don't like Ashley Monroe's voice.  Mermaid should be the next single, it's probably the catchiest song on the CD.  It has even a better hook than Drive By (the first single)! But my review I give 3 stars for several great songs!  But the corny spoken lyrics pretty much ruined the rest of the album for me! The album comes across as not being very serious! IRONICALLY on Save Me, San Francisco the rap style worked better on the title song, and didnt bother me too much on songs like I Got You.  The only song on Save Me San Francisco where this rap style failed was on If It's Love.  BUT, Pat song almost every other song right Hey Soul Sister, This Aint Goodbye, Parachute, You Already Know, Words, Brick By Brick, Breakfast In Bed, and Marry Me!  That's SEVEN songs, what a great album! On the new album he raps or sings his corny lyrics in a style that just turns me off.  But like I said the whole CD isnt a loss, I will add the 4-5 songs to my Trainplay list!

The only thing good about it was the car chase scene. Other than that, I didn't like it at all. McQueen is a great actor but I felt his acting in this movie wasn't very good, aside from the bad script, bad plot, and other bad acting.

0439023521|4.0|I stayed up past midnight just to see what happened.  BUT the book is not just a page turner:  the characters are three-dimensional and the ethical choices they face are thought-provoking.  I suggest reading the book before seeing the movie - as the movie glosses over important events that shape the characters.  An excellent choice for teens, seniors, and in-between - one the entire family can enjoy and discuss.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app. I love it. This app is great for doing things on my desktop while I am out and about. Trust me Download it!

0345803485|1.0|Hundreds of woman raved about this book, so i figured well it's probably a good romantic and sexual book. So i get it and boy was I disappointed. The sexual parts of this book bored and annoyed me. It was repetitive over and over again. Sorry but no storyline in this book. I saw no climax besides the sexual climax in their encounters. It was pretty stupid. I ended up reading a spoiler review on the second book and i figured Mr. Grey had a tough life what else could it have been and i was right. Of course it was he was abused during his childhood, so that pretty much sums it up to why he's a dirty man in bed and a beater too. Like seriously ladies!! i find nothing attractive about this Mr. Grey guy. At first I was interested until i read more and more of the book. Never once did i get so into this book that i couldn't put it down. It actually took me about 2 weeks to finish it. I'm highly disappointed but i should have expected this. WHAT A STUPID BOOK!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome! lots of fun... wish I could do more with buildings. It reminds of harvest moon which I love. perhaps mini games would be nice.

B007R41E8O|5.0|once you get passed the downloading issues. I enjoy this game so much I even forgot what a major pain it was to download. This was my favorite game ever on my Fire.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app allows you to easily access every computer on your in-home wireless network. It is extremely easy to install and to use. You can use the app to control your other computers as well as simply listening/watching/reading etc what the computer is doing. It really is as if you had your other computer(s) in your pocket. As other reviewers have noted, one must be aware of the security/privacy level that exists during a Splashtop session. Being aware of the (small) possibility that someone else is monitoring your remote session combined with the use of a little common sense seems to me to be sufficient but important precautionary action. I find this app to be very good, and use it frequently.

B000002N2N|1.0|Wikipedia claims the guitar, voice and bass were actually recorded in the studio, citing an interview with Marky Ramone. If this is true(and there is a conformation from Wiki comparing the DVD to the CD),then it is probably unfair to compare this to other \\"live\\" albums. This is disappointing as I have just purchased this bogus album. The truth is an elusive and practically unattainable commodity in the world. But I guess I should have known that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After starting this book I could not put it down.  Definitely recommend it.  Had to buy the other two books.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|The Descendants is a successful production. The acting was very good. The pace for the type of story told was reasonable. The emotional journey was engaging. The ending was fair enough. The music track exceptional. I think many people have liked and will like this film.<br /><br />There were several points about the film that made me wonder why the film was received so well. Matt King finds that his comatose wife had been having an affair. He decides to find her lover and invite him to come to the hospital to say good bye to Matt's wife. He goes to great lengths to find him. I'm willing to go along with a character as developed, but this notion defies my reading of the world. I don't think there's more than a man in a thousand who would do this. And there was no reason, no foundation to expect that Matt King would either. Much of the film pivots on this preposterous idea.<br /><br />Second, characters are shown visiting the comatose wife and mother for the purpose of yelling at her about how bad she was as a person. If she could hear what was said, it was utterly cruel to put her through these tirades, her being unable to correct the record or even apologize. It wasn't funny and I couldn't sympathize with the complainants. They went too far, all of them. If she could not hear them, what was the point? They were just having tantrums. Not appealing or entertaining.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />In the end, the wife's lover is discovered and confronted. Matt King invites him to come say good-bye to his wife. The man chooses not to make that visit, but his own wife does. She brings her flowers. Really? Look, with proper development, any character can justifiably be made to do about anything. But this is not the case with this angry, hurt wife. She asks to speak with the comatose woman, which is pretty absurd in itself. She proceeds to \\"forgive\\" her in a tirade that fails to hide her angry resentments. The lady was not portrayed as mentally unstable, quite the opposite, so this scene seems so very, very improbable...and it's cruel, once again.<br /><br />In spite of all this, one feels oddly moved by the movie. The circumstances themselves beg for such a response, wife and mother dying before amends can be made, the finality of death in the bloom of life and such. Emotionality carried the day. So it succeeds despite all these glaring faults. Strange thing.s scene seems so very, very improbable...and it's cruel, once again.<br /><br />In spite of all this, one feels oddly moved by the movie.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is cute and fun to play. It's the Irish super Mario. controls are easy to use. yay for free.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Finally able to change from 1 star to 4! The glitches has been fixed so no more 230+ hours for things, so thank u! After few more fixes I'd definitely give this game a 5! Also, to see the changes I mention below I really wouldn't mind the game costing a $1 or something especially if a lot of the for cash items became coin items. I just really genuinely enjoy this game.<br /><br />Great game that I really enjoy that has allowed me to pass lots of time since Ive been sick, but its also great as a casual game you can check in with once a day or even every few days.<br /><br />As with most games, there are still things that need some tweaking:<br /><br />1. Instead of cash for a better axe & gun make it hard to make, but at least have the option, I know that's probably how their money is made just stinks.<br /><br />2. So prior to today I had no idea there was bait! Definitely would have loved to see that under a different category. For example, where you buy your land expansions & new trees would make a lot more sense instead of with the extra energy, money, food, wood etc. very happy to see the bait I thought whichever animal came was just by chance so like I said awesome idea, but please move where it's located so it's easier to find.<br /><br />3. Maybe a crop that you plant and gives you wood because if a tree has technically 8 chops then each tree is only worth a total of 64 wood after 8 chops/energy whereas a crop can be worth around 72 food after only 1 use of energy. So it obviously couldn't be cheap maybe like 800 coins (costs 100 to plant a new tree) then have it take like 24 hours and give you like 64-100 woodnfor only 1 energy. The gathering of wood is literally a big pain!<br /><br />4.There's now decorations missing :-/ this gave u a more diverse choice for what's on your land instead of like 15 hay bundles, so definitely would love to see them brought back + more bcuz that's how you can bring up the added bonuses to your buildings. Also more decorationsmeans different things on your land like I mentioned before.<br /><br />5. I know its done by level, but now that I have unlocked all the decorations it can be difficult to determine which ones are the most profitable. Organizing the decorations by % added + cost instead of having to try & figure out the best deals. This gives you an easy way to determine, that hey this item that adds a 3% bonus is the best to hide behind a building.<br /><br />6. Putting anything that is for sale via cash should be placed at the back.<br /><br />7. Quicker way to move/organize things would be great like being able to move groups especially for on at least on some areas of farmland and animals or something.<br /><br />8. Be able to see what crops are available without having to actually plant something.<br /><br />9. Also, when a pioneer dies, either being able to delete/remove the gravestone or at least make it worth like bonus points or something. Not only that when the pioneers who move around get sick sometimes theyre behind buildings and stuff so you have to really search for them, which isn't appealing. Maybe either have them stop moving around or have the pioneers that get sick congregate around the infirmary.<br /><br />10. Just overall organization of everything.<br /><br />Finally, when updates are made, a summary of what was done would be super beneficial & helpful. Thanks!

0385534639|4.0|First just one quick note about reviews: just because you didn't like it, doesn't mean it's automatically a bad book/poorly written/etc. that isn't worth the hype. No book is everyone's cup of tea. Reviews should be used to judge if it's a book that YOU would enjoy. Like many other things, a book can still contain flaws and yet be enjoyed immensely if it is a good fit for you.<br /><br />So the question you should ask is not whether Night Circus is \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" but whether it is something you would enjoy. So here's my impressions to help you with your judgement. Overall the book captivated me, but I can still see why some of the other reviewers weren't as fond of it:<br /><br />The start of Night Circus begins in second-person(i.e. \\"you\\"), but soon switches back and forth between many other different points of views. Some readers have found this to be jarring, but it wasn't something that bothered me. If you approach the story looking for one central narrative, then all the jumping around might irk you, but I saw it as many related storylines slowly unveiling and revealing aspects about the other storylines. There were a couple of points of views and parts of the story that at first seemed to come from left-field (like a character named Bailey) and appeared to be random and irrelevant, but if you read to the end, it all comes together.<br /><br />The beginning of the book, after that second-person POV chapter, will likely draw you in immediately with an intriguing set up. The climax and build up to it towards the end of the book is gripping. It's the middle part that I can see why some people might give up on the book. With all the switching back and forth in POV and chapters where nothing 'important' seems to happen, it's going to come as a snooze for some folks and the characters, though striking, come across as not being very well developed. While in retrospect I can recognize how people came to perceive said flaws, none of it was even vaguely registered as Icontinued to flip the pages.<br /><br />You see Night Circus is a book where the setting takes center stage. This is probably a circus you've never seen/heard/read about. The imagery of the circus and the magic is incredibly enthralling, vivid, unique, and at many points the setting is the focus in a scene. If you fall under its spell, you keep reading to experience the world of the Night Circus a little longer and to unravel the mysteries of the people who are involved with it. It's been a while since an imaginative setting filled me with such a sense of wonder. There are novels that are character driven and as such need incredibly well-developed characters in order to succeed, but there are also engrossing novels that are setting-driven where the focus isn't on a character's growth. So while Night Circus's cast might be perceived as \\"flat characters\\" in that they don't get too much in-depth development, they are certainly not dull characters, but a colorful component that adds to the intrigue of the magical circus and the mystery that unfolds that is part dream and part nightmare.<br /><br />But for some of you, the magic will not be enough and instead you will find it excessive and probably self-indulgent. For others like me, it was a breath-taking journey and a world I wished I could experience for real. If there's even a bit of a dreamer or a lover of fantastical settings in you, definitely give this book a try.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|great book. i love the halo games and i decided why not try one of the books. so i read and it was just a great book. eric nylund, please do lots more!
0307346617|1.0|I really can't see how this book is getting high reviews. I was convinced by these reviews that the book was wonderful.  No no no It's not. It's so boring!  I'm a huge fan of zombie books and movies and this book does NOT measure up to my expectations.  I was hoping that as I read more, the book would get more exciting and that the action and the \\"real\\" story would begin to take shape.  Never happened. From one zombie fan to another, skip this one.  Read Bourne, Maberry, Mckinney, Knight or basically anyone else instead.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun to play... I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for energy. graphics are good and it doesn't take long to load. so easy my 2 yearold loves to play.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|very easy to use, sync, and share<br />seriously a no brainer<br />everyone needs this!!<br />get ur buddies passing notes too
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Books were very good, but there were different fonts for each chapter or even in the middle of a chapter it would change the font. As for the books they were great, but sometimes my kindle would have trouble loading the page. I have never had this problem with any of the other books, but after a restart it would usually be there.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|His music is amazing and beautiful! I can listen to the album over and over and never tire of it! I'm definitely going to buy more of his albums.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I am an introverted, 56 year old male, and I have always liked most of the Madonna efforts.  The same can be said for this recent release.  I found only a few of the songs that I could not listen to, otherwise the majority of the tunes are now on my playlist.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is very good not many complaints.except when you have to wait 2 minutes to get energy after you run out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my granddaughter loves this game. she loves it and its easy to play. not hard to understand at all.please make more like this one.
0486284735|5.0|Love this book! That's all I have to say about it. I knew the story really well, from all the movies, etc. But I really enjoyed reading it, especially for as cheap as it is on amazon!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie, as I look at movies as an escape in most cases, and this is really the epitome of an \\"escapist\\" movie!  Brilliant scenery (how can you beat the South of France in the late 50's), beautiful people (Grace Kelley, Cary Grant; two icons of cool sophistication!). unbeatable production quality (cinematography is super good and I think won the Oscar for that category), the direction is splendid (Hitchcock at his peak utilizing everything in his bag of tricks).  The Blu-ray edition only highlights the effervescent qualities of this movie.  I highly recommend you get the the BR version, although I own previous versions as well but they add nothing that the BR version doesn't offer.  The cinematography, location, sets and actors are what really make this such a splendid movie, and the BR version presents all of these in a picture perfect format.  Many reviewers are calling this the best production of any Blu-ray disc released to date(which is very high praise indeed!).<br /><br />Get this movie and leave your worries behind for a couple hours!
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|You really can't go wrong here. This was an entertaining, touching picture centered around a sexy romance and also the value of family! The film is jam packed with fabulous music, phenomenal dancing and talent. And of course VW and Chayanne are a match made in heaven!! I also really agreed with the message at the end, that just says, you can have all the money and success, but if you're with the wrong person, none of that really matters. So true! I absolutely LOVED the floor dancing VW and her partner were in at the Vegas competition thing. And the final dancing scene was soooo great! I don't know where Chayenne \\"came from\\", but he really did \\"make\\" the film what it was - wonderful! Funny too, I used to know a dancer who was just like Ruby's (VW) old dance partner. They look alot alike, dance the same and both have that \\"egotistic\\" nature. I thought that was interesting.
B002LLE3PY|3.0|I'll be direct: \\"Lizard\\" is my least-favorite King Crimson album. I don't like Gordon Haskell's singing. I don't especially like his bass playing, either, or Andy McCulloch's drumming. I don't like the fact that all the album was written by guitarist Robert Fripp and lyricist Pete Sinfield; there's a sameness here that's a far cry from the experimentation of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" or even \\"In the Wake of Poseidon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lizard\\" was KC's third studio album, and came after a major personnel shakeup that saw the departure of bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, saxophonist Ian McDonald and drummer Michael Giles. This album has been called an acquired taste, and I agree. But without this album, King Crimson might have broken up for good, precluding the later releases that were so good, such as \\"Red,\\" \\"Discipline\\" and \\"Thrak.\\"<br /><br />It IS nice to hear this difficult, transitional album in the 5.1 mix created by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson; sonically, at least, the album doesn't sound as muddy and confused as the original. For the most part, though: This album is for King Crimson completists -- dedicated fans who have worked their way through the rest of the catalog and are curious about how the band survived its first personnel crisis.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Brilliant story line - produced and directed to keep your interest right through the movie. Preview gave me a very clear indication of what the film was all about.
B003XTUZIM|4.0|...this 40th anniversary remix of \\"Islands\\" does present the material in its best possible light. One of the standout tracks, \\"Ladies of the Road,\\" is far, far raunchier than most of the King Crimson catalog, but at the time this record was released, the band desperately needed to show it still had some fire in its belly -- KC already had come close to disbanding more than once by the time \\"Islands\\" was recorded.<br /><br />Part of the problem with \\"Islands\\" and its predecessor, \\"Lizard,\\" is that there's simply no overarching vision for the album; the musical styles wander all over the place, from rock to progressive to jazzy. For other groups, that's not a problem, but King Crimson always needed to sound unified, whether they were exploring the airy prog-rock textures of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" or loud/louder dynamic of \\"Thrak.\\"<br /><br />This release will be of most interest to listeners who can play back the DVD-Audio disc, on which Steven Wilson has remixed the sound for 5.1, so that each instrument can be heard more clearly. There's also a CD with just the stereo mix, but frankly, if I were not a DVD-A guy, I would've stuck with my 30th Anniversary version. Bottom line: There's reason to buy this if you're a multichannel listener and a Crimson completist.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a great game to spend some time on. good in airplanes or winding down at the end of the day
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this for my kid but I don't want to share! This game is great! I love the Ice Age movies and this app is great too

B0059XTUVI|2.0|If I knew nothing about Margaret Thatcher I would not have learned anything of significance from this film except that old age can be a negative, lonely experience where you have constant, quick glimpses of segments in your life. Yes, this movie was like a bad dream and Margaret was old 90% of the time. Not even engagingly old, charming, wise or humorous. There was no positive to it. I give Meryl Streep a 10 for her taking this part in such an unremarkable movie, probably trying to save it and the director a -1 for not developing the character(s) at all. And who in the world wrote it??? I could get more from a book report. There were so many flash-backs and flash-forwards there was no time to make a commitment, judgment or emotional connection to the character, or anyone for that matter. I kept thinking from the beginning, \\"it's the directors fault, whoever directed this doesn't like Margaret Thatcher.\\" It was one of those movies, you know the kind, where you can tell right away it isn't going to get better.<br /><br />Even for a political film it was disappointing. Where are Margaret Thatchers rousing speeches that made the people of England rise up and vote for her? None were in this film. Snatches of her philosophy that \\"your life should count for something\\" was in the script but how she made a poignant difference is not, there is a void, again, her legacy is missing. Some of it is 'mentioned', but mentioning is a far cry from feeling her successes. The Trailer preview is an absolute lie! You think the movie will be about a great woman, the First Woman Prime Minister of England! It's going to be exciting, glorious and uplifting!!! That's the lie. The Hair-do in the Trailer, the Confident, In Control Margaret Thatcher?: she's not in this movie. You do get to see her hallucinatory old age thru the whole uneventful thing, with dead husband Dennis showing up constantly, but again, no warmth is felt although you can say intellectually he loved her. Big deal. I don't know about you but I watch movies to be moved in some way.<br /><br />If you watch this movie all you'll feel is regret and that you should write a review to warn others. Dennis was a happily encouraging and playful sort, but again, too much, wearily too much of him so that he became an overbearing nuisance early on. The camera angles were strange and dizzying adding nothing to the bland, passionless scenes. Meryl Streep did not have even ONE instance to really shine and show her remarkable talent, not one time, that's how bad this script is. Because if anyone can pull off and save a bad scene it's Meryl, but there was nothing to work with. Most scenes are in seconds, so look fast... The ending was apropos; don't worry I'm not spoiling anything... she walks down her hall in her house for no apparent reason, we don't know why, we don't care by now, because the movie said nothing and lead up to even less.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Great seeing this movie again with my granddaughter.  She enjoyed it and I enjoyed seeing an old favorite again.  Very, very good
B00498XP1K|5.0|Unless you want to be freaked out do not watch this on off a projector at midnight.  What can I say that hasnt already been said.  If you like zombies you have to watch this.  It is excellent, well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  As stated before, maybe watching it in 100 inches at midnight wasnt the best idea but what the heck.  You only live once, or is that twice.  These are zombies and are not infected as far as I can tell.  That being said, try it, you will like it!  There are 6 episodes and are only a 1.99 each.  45 minute episodes for the first one and 30 or so for the last ones.  So your total outlay will be about 12 bucks for well over 150 minutes of zombie goodness.  2 hours and 30 minutes of fun!  Well worth the price of admission.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game lots of fun for all. adults and kids alike will love playing it. keep the fun coming for all
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This was a free app of the day for me, but after playing it, I would have paid a buck for it. It's a great simple game play that can be played over and over. I highly recommend it, the graphics are simple but very clear and crisp.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app was amazing!!! I love being able to read anytime. the only drawback is with the kindle u have to have wifi =/
B0063IH60K|5.0|Better than the computer.. at least on my kindle. I can't seem to keep myself from constantly pressing new game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really do enjoy playing this game. not sure why but I can sit and stair just waiting on the little guy to run across the screen.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Not sure what I can add. If you liked the previous seasons you will not be disapointed in this one. We burned through the whole thing in a weekend and loved every minute of it!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This App Is Awesome. To Me Its Better Than Youtube! No Problems. i Love The Way we Can Create Playlist
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I don't if this is a \\"typical\\" mystery novel because it's so far out of my normal comfort zone for reading - but it didn't feel typical to me, it felt unique and awesome!  I was a little put off by the cover art, I thought it was too \\"girly\\", but decided to give it a try anyway.  The author had me at the first sentence!  I was trapped, and I finished it all in one evening.<br /><br />Great job, the main character was so real and I was pissing my pants laughing at how small-town the neighbours were!  I can identify.<br /><br />Looking forward to more of the same from Denise.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very well done my kids love it.. hell even I like it<br />keep up the good work ... I'm looking forward to future games
B001GSTOAM|5.0|Before reading this book I used to develop ad-hoc, repeated code several times across several modules. The architecture where I currently work doesn't help in the reusability matter, there isn't a common module. But anyway, this book has shown me the real cost of dirty code and how I wasn't helping at all my sucessors and team mates and above all it has shown me how I was acting unprofessionally.<br />The book, inside its medium constraints (display, formatting, page size, etc.) is very thorough into showing examples of bad coding and how to refactor them. It talks about some principles and practices which help into creating clean code, pherhaps others books elaborate those principles (Single Responsability for instance) in greater detail and the author gives references to those books. Of course each project has its own characteristics, it is up to developer to apply the practices according to the circumstances. You will have to think a lot to find out which patterns would achieve a cleaner code. But, at least for me, it has helped me building components that are easier to mantain and change. And when I write clean code it feels like the computer is working for me, what would first require several Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to implement and much more keystrokes to change, now require just some refactoring (in Eclipse IDE) but also a lot of brainpower, which much better used at refactoring rather than in understanding (namely reading lots of classes, endless scrolling, remembering where is the function that you need,etc. just to understand a single method)<br />So, in short, it is a terrific starting point to produce clean code (easier to understand, change and mantain), that will not hinder yourself or your teamates later, but it is in no way a one-size-fits-all formula, In fact there isn't such thing, at least in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|nice game for the kiddos.  Fun if you like zoo style games.  Also great if you like ice age.  good graphics
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book returns to the main characters of the story, at this moment I have rad about half the book, and I'm worried cause I don't want it to end. Guess I'll have to wait for the next one. Great book , great series.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Here was a great premise for a movie and very well done! The acting was first rate and I don't know about the comic book but this story was great! Just as good as Ironman I thought!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I enjoyed this read... but I didn't enjoy the foul language in the book.  I feel the same point could have been made with out \\"gd\\" used so frequently.
B0014YVC6W|4.0|The Blu-Ray itself was a pleasant surprise. It had a decent quality with more extras than you usually find with these old B-releases. The movie was a bit worse than my mind reminded me, but still well worth the nostalgic watch trough.<br /><br />Only problem I had was with the delivery which actually took almost a month longer that expected, however even when emailing amazon on this they replied swiftly and returned the postage costs which I thought was much better than average response from a normal dvd/blu-ray selling webshop.<br /><br />All in all worth the buy.
044024630X|2.0|I just finished The Affair. Mediocre is an apt description. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it has a good plot. However, I find the many mistakes in military life/knowledge to be more than a little distracting. Mr. Child has never been up to par on this area. It seems he will spend a lot of time researching a vehicle but less than 30 seconds to learn about military protocol or basic life. Ft. Dix is a Marine base?!? Hello! If it is a FORT it is Army. The black subdued oak leaf is a Lieutenant Colonel, not a major. Humvees are not used an a standard means of transportation around towns. They are tactical vehicles not suited for that use. I won't address the gratuitous sex and Reacher's homicidal actions as they have been well addressed in other reviews. There are just a million errors in military procedures, etc. It goes way past artistic license. Mr. Child needs an editor who knows something about the Army. Maybe it's just me, but I had a hard time getting into the story because of constant glaring errors. I spent 18 years in the Army CID so all the garbage about the 110th MP 'special unit' just gets on my nerves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although fiction, I was given a better insight to the hearts of our teenagers, not just in illness, but in their everyday struggles and how parents, try as we may, often have no clue. It made me take a look at children, cancer and life itself in a new way. The Fault In Our Stars is poignant, bold, funny, creative...I am compelled to read it again and again...
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun way to waste hours of your life, and its kind of addicting. The one problem I have with this app is that you have to go to stuff,then go to options to exit out of the app. I wish there was an exit button!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A most riveting book, a real page turner. It is well written, good grammar, easy to read and hard to put down. I found the first of the three books more interesting by far. The second book started a bit sluggish, but got into the groove halfway through, and the third book finished with a bang and a surprise.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best games for the kindle luckily i got it when it was the app of the day but def worth. 99

B0073XORCY|4.0|In 1972 Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock, an 8 year old English school boy,  wrote a poem and won a poetry contest with that poem. The poem was \\"Thick As A Brick\\", and chronicled the hardships of growing up. But then something terrible happened. Gerald and his poem were disqualified after a multitude of protests and threats concerning the offensive nature of the poem, furthered by allegations of the boy's psychological instability. It seems young Gerald used the word \\"g__r\\" during a television broadcast, and to add flame to the fire, a 14-year-old girl named Julia Fealey became pregnant and claimed Gerald was expert at more than poetry. This whole tawdry episode was chronicled in The St. Cleve Chronicle and Linwell Advertiser, a local village Newspaper filled with the usual parochial and amateurish  journalism. The story was on the front page along with an article about an `experimental non-rabbit', a rather naughty connect-the-dots children's activity, the complete, non abridged poem itself ,as well as a review of an album by, the soon to be labeled \\"progressive rock\\" but for now blues/jazz/rock band, Jethro Tull who cut an album with \\"Little Milton's\\" complete poem as its one and only lyric.<br /><br />Now, all of the above is legend, if you haven't figured that out yet...except for the album being cut by the `progressive' rock band, Jethro Tull. By 1972, Jethro Tull were gaining international recognition as sort of a second wave in the British Invasion. The story of Gerald Bostock, and the ensuing row over his poem, not to mention his success with Ms. Fealey were all the product of Ian Anderson's mind. After all, just how much could an 8 year old poetry prodigy tell us about growing up? And the album, Thick As a Brick was, itself, a satirical spoof. Ian Anderson was surprised by the critical reaction to the previous album, Aqualung , as a \\"concept album\\", a label he has firmly rejected to this day. Further, he was rather miffed at having Tull labeled a progressive rock band and grouped with Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer.<br /><br />Anderson's response was: \\"If the critics want a concept album we'll give them the mother of all concept albums and we'll make it so bombastic and so over the top.\\" Ian Anderson has been quoted as stating that Thick as a Brick was written \\"because everyone was saying we were a progressive rock band, so we decided to live up to the reputation and write a progressive album, but done as a parody of the genre.\\" So the band created an album deliberately integrated around one concept: a poem by Gerald about the trials of growing up. Beyond this, the album was a send-up of all pretentious \\"concept albums\\". Even the title refers to someone slow to learn. But maybe the biggest joke was that it worked! the album hit number one in the U.S. The album is notable for its many musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts as well as the instrumentation which includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section. Not exactly your average blues rock lineup, ehh?<br /><br />Well here it is 40 years later and Gerald is all grown up. Anderson set out, on TAAB 2 to write songs that would update the story. \\"I wonder what the eight-year-old Gerald Bostock would be doing today. Would the fabled newspaper still exist? (it does, as a dot com of course) \\" The  album presents five very different , hypothetical life stories for Gerald Bostock, including: a greedy investment banker, a homosexual homeless man, a determined soldier, a sanctimonious church chorister, and a \\"most ordinary man\\" who (married and childless) owns a corner store; by the end of the album, however, all five possibilities seem to converge in a similar concluding moment of gloomy or pitiful solitude.<br /><br />The style of the mock-newspaper cover of the original Thick as a Brick album follows forward forty years as well, an online newspaper has been set up, simply entitled StCleve: [...] so Anderson hasn't lost his satirical sense of humor over the years. And, now that the story has come near full circle, the album asks the question how our own lives developed, and did we end up what we dreamed of being then, or are we surprised and disappointed at the result? And, are there similarities to our dreams, even though that result is different? It's an album that shines a light on those \\"what if?\\" moments us baby boomers are bound to have had.  \\"What ifs, maybes and might-of-beens, perhaps and wait and sees\\".<br /><br />Though it would be near impossible to recreate the astounding ground breaking musical strides of the 1972 original, which is one of the most successful rock albums of all time, but it would have been just as impossible to accomplish that and complete Gerald's journey. Nevertheless, Ian Anderson has managed to create a great album of \\"progressive rock\\", \\"Jethro Tull\\" music updating the story while staying true to the original. The band, even though only Anderson and Scott Hammond, the drummer, remain from the first classic session, is just as interesting and musically disciplined as the classic Tull lineup.<br /><br />The album comes in a `standard jewel case' CD, digital download , and the version I would recommend, a  Special Edition 2-Disc package with a DVD featuring 5.1 stereo mixes, 24 bit stereo, video of the making of TAAB 2, interviews with the musicians and Anderson reading the lyrics in various locations....he may even be in the village square in St. Cleve...<br /><br />The Dirty Lowdownf humor over the years.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is pretty good except you can't get off the game without shutting down or restarting your kindle fire. Thanks to the last review and thank you, for telling me how to get out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You are hooked from the first page... to the last, and before you finish.. you are buying the next two books in the series! This author has delivered the ultimate reading experience that makes the reader \\"HUNGER\\" for more!! I absolutely could not put down this book till I read the whole thing in one day. The Games.ZZZ  are riveting and the characters are so engaging that you are right there with them in the arena.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this version is great on the kindle but I don't have all the worlds like the mine world on my ipod.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This application is buggy at times but still a pretty decent way to download YouTube videos. You constantly have to update it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|too long to wait for energy. dont have money to throw at it... unless i take that trip on the plain.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a great game really fun. and challenging good goal setting and money management<br />I love it and play it every day I love the holiday stuff
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game starts out a bit slow I will admit that,  but it gets to be a lot of fun -- if you are atleast a little patient because it takes a little while -- and is totally worth it, and you don't need to buy anything with real money! You can but I've gotten along fine without it, so really, get this game!
B002ZG98ZA|5.0|Are you kidding me? After all the years of entertaining episodes and a very good feature film, this is how people act? What's wrong with this film? So it's not as fabulous as the HBO series or the first film, it is still the same 4 women everyone loves. I love it and Blu Ray looks amazing. The other people giving this 1 or even 0 stars are biased. They can all suck on my............heel.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|If you don't like this band than you have no heart or soul.  Seriously, anyone who enjoys music will love the Alabama Shakes.  Saw them in concert before I ever bought the album and they were amazing.  Powerful vocals and energy. You will enjoy them.
0385342063|4.0|I love this author's work.  She always makes me laugh out loud and her books have plots, actual plots, unlike a lot of chick-lit.  This one was a lot of fun.<br /><br />I have to confess that I did not actually READ this whole book.  I also listened to a lot of it, after buying it from Audible.  The Audible version is fun and well-read but either way you choose, you should do yourself a favor and buy this book.  It will make a fabulous summer read!
8866131342|5.0|Very simply after a few decades of using all forms of calendar planners, I discovered this one and can't imagine going backward to Day Timers, Day Runners, Covey, Letts, etc. I have also used Moleskine's pocket size planners and journals (both black and red, both 12 and 18 month format) and their \\"large\\" planners and journals (black 12 and 18 month format.<br /><br />I'm no expert for all of this, just someone willing to share his relevant experience. My personal preference is either the 12 or 18 month layout depending on what I know about my next 12-18 month projects. The great thing is that you are buying a product that will last for much longer than 18 months so durability is not an issue. My next preference is pocket vs. large (pocket is perfect size for my uses and large at 10 1/2\\" when lying open is too much for desktop, portability, etc. To the contrary, the notebook/journal/diary is perfect in \\"large\\" but not the planner.<br /><br />My current demands require a large notebook (fantastic additional writing space), a pocket 18 month planner (weekdays on left, ruled notes on right) and a ruled pocket notebook/journal/diary to accompany the pocket planner for additional capacity when needed. Moleskine paper can't be beat (pleasant color, durable, handles fine nib fountain pens (personal favorite) and ballpoints and all varieties of penmanship. My pocket planners have become very relied upon...just have to remember where it is too often (glove compartment, coat pocket, patio, desktop, dog's mouth)! I have never second-guessed switching to Moleskine and giving gung-ho recommendations to anyone inquiring about mine. As usual, I wouldn't buy mine from anyone other than Amazon!

B005V1WZ10|3.0|I've always been a fan of Korn.  They've been one of my top five favorite bands since their first album.  I've heard every song they've ever done, whether it be from their albums, demo's, EP's, even songs they did for movie soundtracks.  Hell, I've bought at least five soundtracks from movies just for the songs by Korn on them that aren't available anywhere else.  But, after this album, I can say Korn is headed in the wrong direction.  I know they're very experimental, and good for them, but dubstep is not what Korn should be.  Only a couple of songs are worth listening to, My Wall being the best on the album.  Chaos Lives in Everything, Kill Mercy Within, Narcissistic Cannibal, Illuminati, and Get Up! are all worth checking out, but they are nothing compared to original Korn.  If you are a die hard Korn fan, you won't like this album.  If you like Skrillex, dubstep, headaches, and wasting your time, you will love this album.
B0061S0A64|3.0|No, it's not a pro sequencer but it can be a lot of fun when it isn't crashing.  I have built some very intense arrangements with a lot of notes and nodes and without fail it crashes after a few seconds to 30 seconds.  Less intense arrangements don't seem to have this problem, but they just aren't as fun.  This is on a Samsung Galaxy SII, so not really a weak device that should be easily bogged down to the point of crashing.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|The repetition in this book is great for little ones and those struggling with language development. I've found kids to be very responsive to it and the questions help interaction. It's simple and short but effective. For slightly older children you may enjoy trying other animal books like [[ASIN:B007V8E1FO Safari Girl]] or [[ASIN:B006OT9PBG Click Clack Moo: Cows That Type]].
B001AT4Y84|2.0|This just the industry trying to make a buck on past successes. The Extra features were good for references and explaining chronology and contents of the previous movies.

B0079TQHDO|4.0|Jeffery Archer is a fantastic author and the \\"chronicles\\" is another terrific story.<br /><br />The big problem I have is with the way they have been marketed. I paid top dollar for the first instalement - only to find i needed to buy the second installment. I read the second book in one day (usually takes me a few days). I found it a bit \\"thin\\" and not good value ( I tend to judge a book by the number of pages I get).<br /><br />I definately do not reckon I got value out of this - and guess what - I have to purchase another episode to find out what happens.<br /><br />The whole thing should have been in one book and this type of marketing is a total ripoff. I'll be double checking before I buy another one of Jeffery's books.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has amazing information.  I have eliminated wheat from my diet (about 95 percent) and have seen a reduction in the flab on my \\"belly\\".  I do work out 3 times a week with a trainer so that is a contributing factor.  I am 66 years old and feel great.  There are many wheat-free, gluten-free products available.  Some are more expensive but I find that I am eating less so it evens out.  I highly recommend this book if you are willing to improve your health and appearance.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The movie is good.<br /><br />There are some minor plot holes, but please point out a movie with no issues in storytelling. None of the plot holes detract from the movie if you're just looking for entertainment.<br /><br />I think this movie is best viewed at night in a dark room for atmosphere.<br /><br />The reviews that are more negative are from people who expect too much from a movie. They're looking for things to complain about. Haters gunna hate.<br /><br />If you're looking for a well paced scary movie Cloverfield is for you.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This movie is one the most enjoyable MI's ever.  If you crave action, this is it!  Anyone who failed this movie is of no use to whom ever they belong too.  Really, the stunts are the best I've seen in the past seven years.  Kudo's to Cruise for doing \\"the stuntman's waltz\\" through this one. The plot build was awesome and thrilling.  It kept me on edge like that Lady Gaga song but... better than that... really better than that!  Anyways, Great work guys!<br /><br />Lars Jon Bulshutz
0143116738|4.0|I wouldn't characterize this as a \\"self help\\" book (because I couldn't see myself ever buying anything labeled as that), but this book definitely helped me take a look at myself and re-evaluate what I'm doing, where I'm going, and what's important in life.  Glad I purchased this!

1451627289|2.0|King creates an appealing protagonist in Jake Epping, a Maine high school English teacher, an affable flake with a good heart who loves his work, the path less traveled and underdogs of most stripes.  As the title suggests and the dust-jacket confirms, this novel is about Jake stumbling into an ability to time travel back to the 50s and 60s, and to potentially change events that have already occurred -- i.e., the JFK assassination in November 1963.  The basis for and terms of Jake's time travel are fairly clever and would form a good basis for a novella or a novel of, say, 200-250 pages.  Regrettably, this potentially good 200-250 page story is lost in an 850-page tome that moves along at a glacial pace and with a great deal of predictability.  Large sections of the book can be skipped altogether without losing any of the real substance of the story ... it's just hard to predict in advance which those sections are.  Obviously a heavy-handed editor could have saved the reader from this difficulty.  In the end, there is not enough payback in the story to justify the mind-numbing pages of plot inactivity.<br /><br />Having been a big fan of many of King's early books (Fire Starter is still my favorite), I've been very disappointed by both this book and Blockade Billy, in which King shows he can write a very poor novella as well.  I would advise sticking to his earlier books, as, for whatever reason, King currently seems to be in a real slump.

0312641893|4.0|I liked CINDER a lot - it was one of those books that kept me turning pages because of the well-paced plot and I didn't want to stop reading it. It was a little predictable, but also exciting. There were parts I thought I knew what was going to happen, and they ended up a little different, but overall I felt like I knew many of the big things were going to happen before they occurred. Now, because this is a retelling so has a basic structure of familiar things sI would look for, that's to be expected, but I wanted more of the big moments to be more a surprise to me. However, I still really enjoyed reading it, and can see that this would actually be good for my middle school students.<br /><br />This book is full of political intrigue, suspense, action, and not knowing what would happen next or how things would work out. There is an intergalactic battle brewing and it adds another whole element to the tension of the story beyond just what is going to happen to Cinder. There was strong world-building as I felt as if I was there with the characters and understood what was happening and why they were dealing with the things they were, but it wasn't overly drawn out with lengthy sections for exposition. It was worked right in and pieces were slowly revealed to the reader as the characters learned them. There are androids and cyborgs and netscreens and hovercrafts and all kinds of technological advancements which add a great science-fiction element to the story as well.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the characters. Cinder is just a warm-hearted character - I was really pulling for her to make it through all of her difficulties. I liked her and I wanted her to come out on top in the end. She is kind and caring even though she has not received this same treatment from others in her life. She is brave, but she has no idea how brave until she is faced with some difficult choices, and realizes what she would and can do to help save people. She is finding her strength throughout this book, and she does it all with an integrity of character that is admirable. She may not be physically 100% human, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't have the feeling and thoughts of one (contrary to what some might believe).<br /><br />There were some great secondary characters (Peony, Ito, Kai) who were endearing as well and made it possible to believe that Cinder would have the will to get through some of the stuff she's going through. And, there are also the requisite evil characters who I really hated (as I was supposed to). Prince Kai is actually my favorite character and he has the start of a sweet romance going on, but he has a whole lot of other issues to deal with as well. I have to say that I would have liked even more of Kai; although, the third person writing style gives us a lot of insight into his character and feelings, but mostly from Cinder's perspective. Kai is strong and sweet and young and looking for something to help him through as he is forced to grow up really fast, and I was definitely supporting him throughout.<br /><br />The ending was intense...I'm not sure where this story could go next. It was previewed a little bit in the final conversation, but I'm still not sure what to expect from the second book. I'm glad this is going to be a quartet of books, but can't believe that means we'll have to wait until 2015 to get the end of the story! I will definitely be picking up the rest of the books though to see what happens with Cinder and Kai next!<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendsher strength throughout this book, and she does it all with an integrity of character that is admirable.

B006L4MX0Y|3.0|I am currently reading the novel which is quite lengthy and has very small print. Finally finished the book and then watched the film.  I recommend reading the novel before watching the film because the film in no way covers the backstories of the characters...if they did this movie would be much longer than the 2 hours.  Reading the book will allow you to have an emotional connection to the characters versus the film where it was very fast paced and in addition explained how each student actually met their respective end.  Overall though, I enjoyed the film
006197806X|4.0|This was one of the books that I was most searching for an ARC of at the NCTE Convention, and as soon as I heard they were out, I went directly to the Harper booth to snag one. I adore Lauren Oliver, she is a fantastic literary author, I've loved both BEFORE I FALL and DELIRIUM, and so kind and generous in person. I was lucky enough to be able to interview her back in October when she was in the Milwaukee area for LIESL & PO (check it out if you missed it) and have become even more of a fan since then. So, needless to say, I dove into this book right away and I wasn't disappointed, but it also wasn't exactly what I was expecting.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked how Lauren chose to tell this story. It alternates between right after DELIRIUM ended and six months later. Through the alternating flashback/flashforward structure, the reader slowly learns about what happened to Lena and what she has had to go through to process all that she has learned and all that happened and how she has ended up where she is. Lena learns a whole new lifestyle after she escapes in the first book, and she has new experiences with new people. All of this is done within the context of her basically being new to this whole world of love being an okay emotion to feel, and that contextualizes everything she experiences.<br /><br />Although I liked how the book was written, I wasn't as in love with this one as I was the first because it didn't go where I was necessarily hoping/expecting it to go. Without giving too much away, I was worried this book would veer into a certain direction, and it unfortunately does a little bit. Basically, I just feel that Lauren is such a strong writer that I didn't feel it needed this element and I didn't totally connect with it (and that's all I'll say because I don't want to get too spoilery), but, of course, I'm not a writing these characters, so I don't really know exactly what Lena needed in this story.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, it's about Lena having to discover her own strength of character and courage, and figuring out what she wants for herself now that she knows what is really going on in her world. It's a bit of a quieter book than the first one, but definitely feels like it's setting up for an explosive finale. Warning: The ending is shocking. Not wholly unexpected, but still a little shocking, and will leave you clamoring for the final installment in this trilogy. It's going to be a long wait for REQUIEM next February!<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendsg to discover her own strength of character and courage, and figuring out what she wants for herself now that she knows what is really going on in her world.

0061733199|5.0|The information in this book is really the stuff taught to a very select group of people today. Many of the things in this book used to be known by almost everyone, maybe 100 or so years ago. This is a useful book to help bring you back this \\"forgotten\\" information and to educate you on that lost but important knowledge. It might be useful for the occasional camping trip or even a long hike in the woods. It will surely be helpful if things go sideways and you find yourself without water, electricity, and food for a few days or weeks during a natural disaster or political upheaval.<br /><br />The book covers everything you want to know about the essentials of surviving in all climates; arctic, mountain, beach, tropical islands, etc. You should keep a print version (no kindle versions allowed when you might not have electricity) with you and be prepared to use it as required.

B004T4KQJS|3.0|I never finished this book. The topic was fascinating but the delivery very dry and repetitive. If I were I an academic perhaps I'd have continued reading. Additionally I found the constant \\"authorship\\" references rather offensive.  The amount of time spent on \\"I did\\", \\"I said\\" and \\"I was proved Right\\" distracted greatly from the supposed topic and reason I chose the book. In fairness perhaps that's just the academics culture.

B0061IMJ2W|2.0|While the show is fantastic, it's the HD quality that lowers my rating.  Other streaming outlets, HULU and NetFlix work fantastic on my computer, but Amazon videos show in poor quality and always show a poor connection.  The HD on NetFlix remains fantastic, as seen on the first season of this show, but the second season through Amazon is poorer quality than anything.  And that is when viewed in succession, not at different times, same settings, same conneciton speeds through the router.<br /><br />I'm eager to see what happened but I won't pay for HD quality, or even low quality, to view it as large pixels and stop-gap screenshots.

B0015DROBO|1.0|So the author/journalist of this fictional account Stieg Larsson fails to intervene when he sees a rape and goes on to write a bestselling book (and movie) based on it and he or his estate profit off that very real crime of rape of a very real human that he chose to not help but ignore and later regretted. Really pitiful. The character is even named after the girl who was raped. I hope 100% of the profits are going to rape and violence charities for prevention and education.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Show is even better on Blu-ray. Picture quality is fantastic and the sound is great, especially if you have a nice surround sound system.
B003Y5H5AQ|2.0|I can't rate this for kids separately, but I bet most kids under the age of 6 would watch this and be happy, so for that youngest age group I give FIVE STARS. For everyone above the age of 6 years, there isn't much here of interest. We watched this movie with a large age range. From young adult to 76 we all agreed there wasn't much to like. It's cute. Neil Patrick Harris was very cute. Jayma Mays, also very cute. The smurfs were, yes you guessed it, cute! You know, I think even Gargamel was cute. There were a lot of \\"blue jokes\\" for anyone looking, I'm sure we even missed a few. Other than that, I believe there was one non blue joke, and it involved a porter potty. So if you like off color (blue jokes) or toilet jokes, then it's not just a bunch of cute people running around. This felt like an old school smurfs t.v. episode from my childhood and it didn't seem to have grown up to fit the big screen. So basically, your kids will laugh but you will not, but still it's a cute movie. Did I mention it was cute?<br /><br />The Christmas Carol short of the combo disc package was quite enjoyable. I think it was more universal and done well enough. You can never have too many grouchy Scrooges.

0385344228|2.0|Landay has a good concept, but the execution fails.  The book never comes together.  The story line is relatively simple:  an Assistant District Attorney's son is accused of murder.  Although a self-made man and one of the good guys, the ADA has a family history of violence.  The premise is compelling:  does nurture or nature or neither explain a murderer?  The subtopics are is there a genetic predisposition to violence?  And do we have free will?  That's an ageless discussion which has had significant contributions from scientific work on the human brain and genetics in recent years.  Our religions and our laws presuppose that man has free will and is responsible for his decisions, and it is critical to all of our institutions that he does.  If we do not have free will, then all of our understanding about the nature of man must be seriously revised and all existing premises about ourselves scrapped.  Landay has an opinion on the subject, and the story he has selected to illustrate his opinion is definitely interesting, but he never conveys to the reader the overwhelming importance of the debate.  In the hands of a Scott Turow, it could have been a very good book and still left the reader wondering about the nurture versus nature conflict, as he should because the topic remains unsettled.<br /><br />Landay deals with the issue of nature versus nurture so superficially that the characters, despite what would cause serious soul searching and deep anguish in real people, never come to life, never show us the confusion and pain the situation would create in real people.  The characters lack depth and humanity; they are paper cut-outs, in my opinion, because Landay does not write believable dialogue.  The exchanges between characters, instead of developing character and illuminating the inner workings of the mind and heart, almost negate what he is trying to do.  I suggest that when an author decides to use first person narrative, as Landay has in this novel, he should not tackle such a difficult thesis, especially if he has a point of view contrary to millennia of discussion, debate, and experiment which he wants the reader to accept.  In first person narrative, the reader is not granted insights into the minds and hearts of other characters except through the dialogue, and if the dialogue fails, the book fails.  Although the courtroom exchanges are reasonably informative and hold attention, the private dialogue is just too stilted and wooden.  The narrator himself is insufficiently introspective for the reader to gain greater understanding of the argument between determinism and free will.  When the reader finishes the novel, I suggest that Landay has not provided sufficient depth of insight into the way the human heart works to make his conclusion or even his story line believable.  Overall the book is superficial and unconvincing; Landay was way in over his philosophical head.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Downloaded the game to a Toshiba Thrive with no problem using Wi-Fi.  Started the program and began having problems when using a previously found item  White blocks where text was displayed showed up and there was no way to clear them short of exiting the game and restarting the game.  Hopefully, the developers will fix the problem soon and issue an update.  Until then would recommend holding off buying this game.  Have run a number of other similar type games with no problems so it seems like this fixable.  Right now not enough play time to rate game's fun factor.<br /><br />UPDATE RECEIVED on April 20, 2012 from the developers fixed this issue.  The game appears to be working fine.

0345803485|5.0|the idea of smbd has always intrigued me. I love this book but not for the steamy scenes but for the depth of Ana and Grey. they are real people with a real ideals and it explores how smbd plays a major part in both their lives. I think it reads more as a love story than an erotic novel... I really really enjoyed the book and the complexity of both male and female povs.

0062119044|5.0|The premise is dark - that a relationship between a mother and her child could be full of such vitriol. Yet, the storytelling is passionate, interesting, surprising, and has lotsa big words. And even though I `knew how it ends' I enjoyed the journey.
0545259088|3.0|This is actually a tough review for me to write! I loved Shiver and Linger, and while I liked Forever I didn't love it. I did like Grace as a wolf and watching her stuggle with the shifting until it was warm enough for her to stay human. I truley feel that all of that added something great to Grace's character. I wasn't a huge Sam fan in this book, he seemed so negative, and ready to give up. I did love Cole though, and his experiments. I feel like I finally got to know the real Cole! I love the dynamic between Isabel and Cole, and how it evolved through the book, and Same and Grace were well...Sam and Grace...The story in this book was fitting for the final chapter in this series, but it didn't grab me the way the other 2 books did. The one thing I won't complain about is that it wasn't all wrapped up with a pretty bow, but it gave me the closure I needed to be satisfied by this book, and the series. I am giving this one 3.5 stars! I do recommend this whole series to everyone though.

B0051BNRTO|2.0|Nick Hornby didn't rely on any clever twists or jokes to tell this story.  That's too bad, because it's kind of why I like his stuff.  The best things I can say for this book is that I read it quickly, and it helped me go to sleep at night because I wasn't challenged in any way.
0307951529|5.0|In this day and age, it's easier than ever to become an entrepreneur. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), not everyone has the ways or means to do so.<br /><br />This book is a great look at how easy it really is. All too often, money tends to be the reason we don't start our own business or go after our dreams. Chris Guillebeau takes a look at how you don't need a whole lot of money do do what you want to do. You can make a living doing what you love and it doesn't require you to take a huge chunk of change out of your savings account.<br /><br />All the while, he really talks about looking at your life and figuring out what you already know how to do that can be transformed into a way to make a living.<br /><br />This book has a really hopeful quality about it; all it requires is a little hard work.
0439023491|1.0|the only reason this was written was to make money. its a childrens book. nothing to see or learn here from this book, just a story where: \\"he does this,\\" \\"she does this.\\" i should have seen the final plot twist coming. too bad i didnt.<br />some people say that this book is only written to make the series a trilogy. i think its a fine book, but her purpose when writing it was to try a different story style. most of it was crap though, a big spacer.

B002JYPV3G|4.0|Slipknot has been one of those bands that fans of extreme music have either loved or hated, with very little in between. This album still has tracks that I find myself listening to even after all these years though after hearing their more recent albums, I feel that the band has evolved a lot over the years, though many fans might argue that it was a devolution.

B000FC1192|5.0|So after hearing some things about Neil Gaiman, I ended up reading The Graveyard book and loved it, which is how I discovered Coraline.  Don't let the fact that it's a children's book steer you away, this is a great read.  It's very imaginative and the illustrations add to the creepy vibe of the book.  I wasn't sure if I would like this book, but at a short length and a fast pace, you can finish the book in one day so you've got nothing to lose.  Give it a shot, you'll love it

1402786360|5.0|I just received my copy of this amazing book!  Followers of Heather's blog [...] will recognize many of the desserts featured in this book but will be pleasantly surprised to find some new and beautiful treats!    For those that are looking for just a recipe book, this is probably not for you.  Although it is filled with fun and creative recipes (as well as recipes for basic cookies, cakes, fondant, icings, etc) this book is a how-to on baking and decorating artful desserts.  Heather exceeds all expectations and has truly developed something that the everyday baker can use to further their artistic skills to make unique and awe-inspiring desserts.  This is not your typical \\"how to frost a cupcake\\" kind of book - be prepared to really go outside the box to create edible works of art.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|At first I thought it was a little bit too cheesy and overdone and was wondering if I would even make it through the three hours that was the length of this movie. But then, it got good. A totally different kind of story, don't expect this movie to be anything near the actual storyline of the book, but that's what makes it great. This girl, Amanda Price, gets thrown back in time to this story and ends up messing everything up. Instead of Charlotte ending up with Collins, she goes to Africa and Mr. Bingley at first ends up falling for her instead of Jane! Much hilarity ensues when she wildly professes she can't be with him because she likes girls, after being backed into a corner by him. The plot has many twists and turns and is quite believable as to what might actually happen if someone from this time got plopped into the middle of a Jane Austen book. It was delightful and funny and I highly recommend it, especially if you've seen one too many bad movie renditions of Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />[...]
B0017ZM3S4|5.0|My hat is off to Kang Chol-hwan for the suffering he endured and the years of his life wasted in this harsh North Korean prison camp. The author manages to grip you with his brutal honesty, courage and strength. He leaves nothing out and we get a vivid account of daily life in this nightmarish prison camp. His compassion for his countrymen is also commendable. I wish this author all the success and happiness he deserves. Thank you for bringing this to the worlds attention. It has certainly given me compassion towards the citizens of North Korea. They have been in my prayers.
B00005MP58|3.0|Among fans this is only \\"the Colin Firth one\\", that gets many compliments amoung Austen fans. Presumably he is the best Mr. Darcy and I have to admit, they're probably right. He does it well and is suitably alluring in character. However, the girl who played Elizabeth opposite him, Jennifer Ehle, wasn't quite as believable. I really liked her, she was a great actress, and played Elizabeth well, but seemed to be good only when by herself. As soon as the two were together, I had a hard time feeling the pull of attraction between them and I'm not sure why. In any case, it's a worthwhile rendition, over five hours long and worth the time I think.<br /><br />[...]
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games gives us a great view on how young people view and deal with war and hardships. These books are truly something not to be missed, and will not soon be forgotten. I will not be surprised if some 20 years down the road, The Hunger Games will be a reading requirement for High School English studies. This trilogy screams classic. Thank you, Collins, for such a splendid read.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I really detest Knightley. I've never liked her even though I've desperately wanted to. Her quirks and mannerism's all seem to scream \\"Look at me! Look at me!\\" in almost a Lydia like fashion, pardon the pun. The Darcy in this one was good, loved his eyes, but I just couldn't get past Knightley. There were redeeming qualities about this though. Donald Sutherland as her father was excellent and I especially enjoyed the final scene between he and his daughter when he's asking her if she really likes Darcy. He tears up and it's entirely believable. I did not like the scene at the end when Darcy and Lizzie finally declare their love for each other. Instead of answering, in this version, Knightly takes his hand and kisses it. I'm very much convinced, after reading several Jane Austen's and books during this era, that this would not have happened. There is just too much propriety here during this age for that. Took me out of the story, and because of it, can't recommend it.<br /><br />[...]

0486284735|5.0|[...]<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has got to have one of the best male characters of all time, Mr. Darcy. I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.<br /><br />Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.<br /><br />[...]d it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.<br /><br />[...]

0871404133|5.0|A sweeping history of life and a great read. Despite his special interest in entomology, Wilson is a great generalist who is able to combine evidence from the sciences and the humanities to give us a new look at human nature and an understanding of its consequences, both for us and the rest of life on this planet. Having evolved by both individual selection and group selection, we are torn between selfishness and altruism. These two driving forces make us what we are, for better or for worse. Defined by these opposites, we struggle for a balance between our creativity and our destructivity. \\"The brain ... is an organ not merely divided into major parts but divided against itself.\\" This dichotomy has given rise to all of our great art, music, literature and science, but it has now brought us to the brink of disaster.<br /><br />\\"The struggle to control vital resources continues globally, and it is growing worse. The problem arose because humanity failed to seize the great opportunity given it at the dawn of the Neolithic era. It might then have halted population growth below the constraining minimum limit. As a species we did the opposite, however. There was no way for us to foresee the consequences of our initial success. We simply took what was given us and continued to multiply and consume in blind obedience to instincts inherited from our humbler, more brutally constrained Paleolithic ancestors.\\"<br /><br />This book is a perfect companion to [[ASIN:193149858X Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update]]. Using Gauguin's great painting \\"Where Did We Come From? What Are We We? Where Are We Going?\\" as an outline, Wilson, in tackling that last question, comes to the same conclusions as the authors of Limits, who first warned us of them back in 1972, that we are \\"destroying our birthplace\\":<br /><br />\\"The evidence for climate warming, with industrial pollution as the principal cause, is now overwhelming. Also evident upon even casual inspection is the rapid disappearance of tropical forests and grasslands and other habitats where most of the diversity of life exists. If global changes caused by HIPPO (Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution, Overpopulation, and Overharvesting, in that order of importance) are not abated, half the species of plants and animals could be extinct or at least among the 'living dead'--about to become extinct--by the end of the century. We are needlessly turning the gold we inherited from our forebears into straw, and for that we will be despised by our descendants.\\"<br /><br />After acknowledging that myths and gods have been the well springs of much great art, Wilson rightly condemns today's organized religions because \\"they encourage ignorance, distract people from recognizing problems of the real world, and often lead them in wrong directions into disastrous actions.\\" But then he confesses to his own blind faith: \\"Earth, by the twenty-second century, can be turned, if we so wish, into a permanent paradise for human beings, or at least the strong beginnings of one. We will do a lot more damage to ourselves and the rest of life along the way, but out of an ethic of simple decency to one another, the unrelenting application of reason, and acceptance of what we truly are, our dreams will finally come home to stay.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately this faith is not supported by the evidence. Wilson is not taking into consideration the rapidly closing window of opportunity to turn things around. As Limits to Growth shows, population, non-renewable resource depletion and pollution are growing exponentially, overshooting the ability of the global ecosystem to sustain them. Their computer models, using current data, show a collapse of the industrial system around 2050, just as their 1972 models did. The one thing Wilson overlooked in his examination of Homo sapiens' evolution is that our brains and our cultures have developed during long periods when rates of change were very slow compared to the present. We're not wired to deal with problems beyond our own generation. By the time our politicians and corporations see it coming, it will be too late. Yes, we have the technology to begin converting to long-term sustainability right now, but it's not happening. We are creatures of the moment. Selfishness comes first, altruism later, both for individuals and nations. If it were otherwise, as Wilson says, we would be social robots like the ants. But \\"acceptance of what we truly are\\" may be our only hope, and in that sense books like these are of great value.re not wired to deal with problems beyond our own generation.

0439023521|4.0|I really liked it.<br /><br />Having said that, I would like to point out how reluctant I was to read it. I felt the story was overplayed. When I first heard the plot, I immediately thought of Battle Royale as well as the story of the Minotaur. My best friend kept pressuring me to read it and I kind of wanted to see the movie, so I broke down and bought it.<br /><br />It moves very quickly. I liked how it was set up and the progression of the plots and themes. At times, I would sigh because I wondered at the quality of the writing. However, you need to remember that this is written from the point of view of a 16 year old girl and realistically conveys this idea. It also is about a 7th or 8th grade reading level. It likely won't challenge the adult reader, but it does create a nice escape while you read. It took me a little less than a day to read and I would say I am a relatively slow reader.<br /><br />I think there are characters that everyone can relate to. I liked Peeta the most. I felt he was the most relatable especially with how he is portrayed in the book when compared to the movie. I'm not saying they did a bad job in the film because they really didn't. Things in the books just made the basic framework of Peeta's character clear and it's just not possible to put everything in a movie. I can see many teenage girls relating to Katniss and her struggles to fit in, survive and figure out what she wants while fulfilling what she sees as her responsibility.<br /><br />I do think this would be an appropriate read for a younger teen. I probably would say no younger than 10 although you know your children. It may be something you could read together and talk about injustices the government is committing. I'm not saying you should raise rebels or anything, but every child needs to learn at some point if or when they would need to stand up to an authority figure.

B000H305U0|5.0|I believe that I first got this CD when I was a senior in high school. My friend gave it to me for Christmas and I would listen to it on repeat. I ordered this because my CD has disappeared. I suspect that a family member took it with them when they decided I wouldn't want it anymore.<br /><br />I bought this because I couldn't, for some odd reason, find an MP3 version with all the songs uncensored. I sat there when I got it and just listened. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's the best CD ever made, but it does get my heart pumping and that's what I like my music to do. I find Justin's voice to be smooth and and the featured artists only add to the music in a positive way rather than in some songs on the radio where they are clearly only there for the name. I have a little problem with the track that has Will.I.Am. on it, but I just have a problem with him in general.<br /><br />I think this is a good piece of work. Everybody in my family has very different tastes and we have always agreed for the past 4-5 years that this is an appropriate and pleasurable CD to play in the car to make everybody happy.

I don't really care if she \\"borrowed\\" the ideas from others, I'm just grateful they are here in this wonderful book.  The writing style is easily accessible and I enjoyed the day-to-day format.  Thank you Rhonda for keeping the magic alive in your writing and continuing to bring us these thoughts and ideas!  When I read and applied The Secret, I went back to my goal list years later and was suprised and excited that 3 out of the ten had come to fruition.  I'm hoping to have the same track record with the fresh implementation of the ideas brought forth in The Magic!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it is so cool it shows you the wether so you don't have to worry how the aether is going to be today
1451683405|4.0|The author immediately takes the side that there is not \\"free will\\", he states his case in a very adamant way perhaps intentionally trying to shock those that believe in an independent free `soul'.  The author has a very limited definition of what it means to have free will, requiring the ability to create action without any influence from prior events or background conditions, i.e. to create something out of nothing.<br /><br />Obviously this definition of free will would cause anyone who thinks about it much to agree that this does not exist.  We are not isolated little gods that are immune from cause and effect.  And yet the author himself admits a \\"mysterious\\" process where thoughts \\"appear\\" with the cause at least unknowable, if not without cause.  I would suggest that whole idea of free will (as defined by the author) only applies if you view humans as independent beings (i.e. having a unchanging `soul' unconnected to nature or events).  When humans are view as a process, as part of a continuum, the idea of the \\"self\\" changes radically and free will becomes a creativity that does in fact just \\"appear\\" seemingly from nothing.  The idea of cause and effect being only relevant in timeline (which our human view is captured in).  When time is not a factor, things can `appear' without cause; as in the cause with quantum mechanics or the Big Bang \\"beginning\\" of the universe.<br /><br />Regardless of your current views, the book is well worth the read.  Perhaps even especially if you disagree with the author - challenging your own ideas is always worth the aggravation.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This was a very interesting book that helps us to understand why we do things, and how to ontercept the cycle of our habits
B001TKKAJG|4.0|This is now my \\"go to\\" copy of Big Pink. I have an original LP, the Capitol remaster and the original MFSL gold disc. This has never been an \\"audiophile\\" recording to begin with, but Mobile Fidelity's SACD is the best it's ever sounded.<br /><br />What gets me right away is the tonality of the voices: Levon, Richard and Rick's voices sound natural and lifelike. There's is a lot of midrange information on this album: the guitar, organ, piano and voices have always meshed together. While remastering will never \\"fix\\" that (and I'd argue that's a part of the sound of Big Pink), this SACD really helps separate the voices... the guitar and organ still weaves around each other, as it should. And Rick's bass sounds great! Not bloated, but present.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you love Big Pink.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is not slow like other games like this and the add ons are pretty cheap.  the movies are cute too! rather addicting!
B006NYQAJM|5.0|I'm a recent convert to the cult of Lego collecting. I grew up with the toys, but was brought back into the fold as an adult. And being a huge comic book fan growing up, this DC line has been something that I've really looked forward to.<br /><br />As far as mini figures and play features go, this is the best set in the DC Superheroes line. So of course that means it's a hard-to-find exclusive.<br /><br />MINIFIGS:<br /><br />1. Batman - This is the blue/grey Batman from the classic comics and 60's TV show. Everything looks great, from the utility belt to the batarangs included in the set.<br /><br />2. Robin - This is the same Robin fig that's included with the Batcave set, which is the red and black variation on the costume. It would have been awesome to have had the yellow/red/green costume variant in this set to compliment the cartoony nature of the Funhouse, but it's no big deal.<br /><br />3. Joker - If you want the Joker, this is definitely the set to get him in. It's the same figure as the one in the Batwing set, except this one has a remote control rather than a joke gun. He looks great.<br /><br />4. Harley Quinn - It was awesome of LEGO to put her in this set instead of some random henchman. The figure looks great. The hat, especially, is perfectly sculpted.<br /><br />5. Riddler - The inclusion of this figure is what instantly makes this the best DC set. I wish his hat would have matched his body better and a question-mark staff would have been awesome, but I'm just excited to see him back in minifig form. Three villains in one set? You really can't go wrong.<br /><br />SET:<br />As if the figures weren't cool enough, the Funhouse itself is packed with awesomeness. The color scheme is really fun and every part of this play-set is packed with features. You've got moving floors, derailed rollercoaster cars, a swinging hammer, and a crane. Really, really great... and the first real villain's hideout that LEGO's made for any superhero line.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This really works! If I need to look for something at night and don't have a flashlight handy I just grab my fire and use this app.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I'm a recent convert to the cult of Lego collecting. I grew up with the toys, but was brought back into the fold as an adult. And being a huge comic book fan growing up, this Marvel line has been something that I've really looked forward to.<br /><br />This is the tiniest set in the line, but super important because it comes with Captain America.<br /><br />MINIFIGS:<br />1. Captain America - I love seeing his shield in LEGO form! I do wish he had some sort of helmet and that the blue of his suit was just a tiny bit lighter, but just seeing Captain America in minifig form is pretty freaking awesome.<br /><br />2. Aliens (2) - Two of the aliens (Loki's Army... or so I'm told. I haven't seen the movie yet) are included. It's cool that there's more than one of them, though I wish one would have been replaced by a classic villain like Red Skull or something. Maybe once the movie's out I'll change my opinion on them. Now they're just kind of boring.<br /><br />SET:<br /><br />Pretty basic. You get Captain America's cycle (which is pretty cool but nothing fancy), an alien glider-type thing, and an alien battle station. It's got a lot of play-ability for kids, but kind of boring for collectors. Still, it's definitely a highly rated set because it's the only way you can get Cap!
B007SGM084|2.0|Why so much for this Trilogy?  I would love to read this set, and I love my Kindle.  However, I am not willing to pay this price for a simple download.  There is something not quite right when it is cheaper to purchase the actual paper books than the Kindle editions.  Publishers need to re-think their pricings if they want dedicated customers, in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Easy and fun to play. Keeps the player busy and has very nice graphics. z<br />Nothing to complain about so far.

B0041B785Y|5.0|to be honest at first i was kind of dissapointed when i heard this cd. it just didnt measure up to obzen, nothing, or chasophere. i gave it another ten listens and i think this might be my favorite meshuggah album. again at first i thought it was way to simple. boy was i wrong. though not the most complicated its probably the heaviest of  meshuggah. 2012 has already had some amazing relases. this being one of them along with the mars volta, high on fire, and lamb of god.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Her mother was a really powerful being, but Pia Giovanni only has a fraction of that power. However, her ability to pick up locks and a not so nice ex-boyfriend put Pia in danger when she finds herself being chased by the most powerful being there is - a beautiful man who can turn himself into a dragon. While on the run, she meets a lot of other powerful beings, gets herself into a lot of trouble... and also falls in love.<br /><br />I loved this book! I admit the main character's name - Pia Giovanni - is funny in portuguese but she's probably one of my favourite female leads right now. She makes the right decisions, she is strong and doesn't run straight into her enemies. Moreover, the dialogues are extremely funny and I found myself laughing at some passages. As Pia states at some point in the book, her body is inhabited by a lunatic so we should ignore most of what she says - she's brilliant. Even though there is really no mystery in the book, it's extremely hard to put down as Pia's adventures keep coming. Filled with highly likeable characters, this book was a treat to read!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I kept hearing about this book, but didn't know the story behind it. I decided to give it a try, and I couldn't put it down! I ended up buying the trilogy, because I couldn't bear not knowing what happens next.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|One of the main highlights of last summer was attending the 360 concert in East Lansing.  I know that I am bragging now, so bear with me, but I was literally only six feet away from Bono when he made the \\"rounds.\\"  He was in a direct line from me, and to say that I was starstruck is an understatement.  Granted he only loitered in this spot for a few minutes while I tried in vain to make eye contact with him before he roamed onward to another degree of the 360 stage.<br /><br />I enjoyed the making of the 360 Degree concept/set special feature on this DVD.  The engineering behind the stage set-up was extremely impressive.  Bono acknowledges that while he is very creative and artsy, he didn't know the nuts and bolts of what it actually took to make this 360 concept a reality.  From what I heard, the band only broke even with this tour because the overhead costs were so astronomical.<br /><br />And finally, the music is invigorating and passionately performed.  Whenever I am cleaning, I pop this baby into my All-in-One Dell Computer Blu-Ray player and enjoy the show all over again (though the set list for the Rose Bowl show differs a bit from the East Lansing show). I'm not enough of a techie to gripe over the \\"low quality\\" of the Blu-Ray video or \\"disjointed\\" camera angles, as more savvy reviewers have observed.  I just enjoy this DVD, and it brings back good memories of a fantastic concert (where there were moments when I was only six feet from Bono!).
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Like the first book in the series, Sanderson has crafted a story rich with mystery, suspense, and action.  The characters that we were introduced to in the first book are further explored and continue to develop.  The plot is complex enough that it keeps you turning pages but not so complex that things get muddy or that it slows the book down.  This is only the second thing that I've read from Sanderson, but I've been very impressed so far and look forward to more from him.<br />If I had one negative thing to say about this second book of the trilogy, it would be that I would have chosen a different title.  Obviously the Well of Ascension comes into play at the end of the story, but it consumes such a small portion of the book that it doesnt seem to fit as the title.  I would have probably called the book \\"The battle for Luthadel\\" or something similar.<br />Regardless, the book is another exceptional read and fans of this genre will be glad they read it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|so I got the app because I'm told angry birds is great I got it and loved it woooohoooo thanks for the recomendation peep
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very good...very sad. Glad there was no sex & almost no bad language. Hopefully will give young ladies a hero!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I am almost universally impressed by the quality of production of all of the \\"cable\\" network originated series and movies.  Game of Thrones is even better than most others.<br /><br />The production is lush and impressive (I have not read the novel); the acting is superb; the character development is magnificent; and the \\"look\\" of the program is breathtaking.<br /><br />It is violent, intriguing, sexy, erotic, profane, exciting and hypnotizing.  I am watching the series as it is broadcast.  I anxiously await each week's installment.<br /><br />If you wish to be entertained by an excellent story that is beautifully produced, you cannot go wrong with this title.<br /><br />Donald B. Cripe
0439023513|5.0|I really liked this book and how they ended the series.... I felt a little sad for the characters in how the ended the book, but only because I'd been reading about them for 3 books and cared about them and wanted to see them happy, but that wouldn't have been keeping with the storyline to make a perfect happy ending for them.<br /><br />I think this booked was written very well and enjoyed all of the twists and turns that it provided, while not having a traditional 'hunger game' in it, it felt just as compelling as the other books.  I'm sad the series is over.

B0025VLEM0|2.0|Funny movie. Good 5.1 effects. The HD isnt very high def. Can't compare with newer HD movies. Good for the price though.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|I can imagine the pitch for this book: okay, let's take that corny show on VH1, \\"I love the 80's,\\" with all those grade B and C celebrities saying \\"Remember He-Man? Wasn't he totally awesome?\\" and make it a book.  A Sci-Fi book.  With robots and stuff.  Done, now let's find a hack to write it.<br /><br />The story was simply right now pretending to be 2041, and that's not the future.  That's not even that creative.  It was like not a single movie or book or significant technological step had been taken forward in the intervening years between our decade and theirs, and despite a few cursory mentions of am energy crisis and an ecological deterioration this book didn't feel like it created a new world even one tiny bit.  The characters were comprised of three basic emotions: anger, geekiness and love (and I know geekiness isn't an emotion but cripes they sure shove that down your throat) who have apparently, because they themselves tell you so, memorized every line from every scene from some cult movies in the 80's.  There were funny moments, and yeah, hopefully people will explore the back stories of the phone phreaks and delve a little deeper into the games and movies the novel references, but hearing that the protagonist just hacked into some computer because, oh right, he's a 99th level whatchamacallit with a vorpal pair of headphones of listening is a trite and lazy way of moving the plot forward.  Some character references a macguffin early on, and it doesn't take long to see that the whole book is a macguffin: just a plot ball rolling downhill knocking clich&eacute;s out of the way.  Maybe the author will actually take a creative writing class and learn a little about character development, but this book feels like the novelization that comes AFTER some movie that's hit big, and that's totally bogus man.  To the max.
0545165067|3.0|When Grace was six, she was attacked by wolves. But something (someone?) saved her. Since that time, she has been obsessed with the wolves that live in the forest behind her house in Mercy Falls, Minnesota. Obsessed, in particular, with one wolf. She thinks of him as her wolf. There's something in his eyes that makes him seem so intelligent, Grace knows she should fear him and not get too close, but she can't help herself. The wolf watches her too. When a boy from her high school is reportedly killed by a wolf attack, the townspeople of Mercy Falls step up to eradicate the danger, legal or no. Grace is desperate to stop men from shooting the wolves she feels such a kinship to, but finds herself engulfed in a world much more dangerous and mysterious than she had anticipated when she finds a boy bleeding on her back porch.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised and happy at having chosen to listen to the audiobook of Shiver. Being completely out of the reading loop for a few years due to school and other real life business, I hadn't even heard of this series until I was browsing the shelves at Barnes and Nobel this past year and came across the paperback of Forever, the final book in the series. I fell in love with the cover immediately, and subsequently with the covers of Shiver and Linger as well (okay...so Linger's a little GREEN for me). The books didn't sound overly exciting to me, basically Twilight without the vampires (this is also how my friend Alyssa of Books Take You Places described them to me), so I wasn't in any rush to actually read them. That said, when I found them available for download through my library, and the mood for paranormal romance struck, I put Shiver on my i-pod and proceeded to savor it over several weeks.<br /><br />Listening to Shiver was addictive. I found myself unable to put down the i-pod when I had other things to do, and looking for more brainless activities to give me more listening time. Needless to say, the kitchen was cleaner than normal for the time it took me to get through this book. It helped me realize some things about myself and my book preferences. For instance, I much prefer dual perspectives when read by several narrators (I haven't listenened to many multi-narrator books before), and while I enjoyed David LaDoux as Sam, I have completely fallen for Jenna Lamia as a narrator. Her narration as Grace was wonderful, she locked me into the story and made me enjoy the characters immensely. It's so nice to have someone narrate a YA book who actually sounds like she could be in high school! This made Grace more believable than some of the other YA audiobooks I've listened to in the past.<br /><br />Now for the story. I honestly had fairly low expectations going in, and found myself pleasantly surprised by the story of Shiver. Yes, it's your classic YA paranormal romance, but Maggie Stiefvater created a unique and interesting werewolf mythos that kept me hooked and wanting to learn more. Without giving too much away, I'll say that the title (and the temperatures given at the beginning of each chapter) are a reflection of the werewolves physical changes as a reaction to temperature rather than moon cycles. All of the questions that were raised for me at the beginning I felt were answered (like, if the werewolves change in reaction to temperature drops, why don't they just move to Hawaii?). Other factors that I greatly enjoyed were the fact that there was no love triangle (Ms. Stiefvater I could kiss you!), no cliff hanger, and there was enough side story going on to keep me from gagging at the gushy stuff. Okay, I gagged a little. I'm sorry, I can't stomach poetry and song lyrics very well in text, but when you put them on an audiobook I have that whole `omg this is so embarrassing' reaction where I feel nauseous and turn beet red like it's happening to me. Unfortunately, Grace and Sam's connection was that \\"I've always loved you\\" type, second only in play to insta-love, but whatever. Ican overlook this trope every so often when I enjoy the story.<br /><br />I do kind of wish that I had finished Shiver before reading The Scorpio Races, because quite frankly that book was so much better it hurts. Still, I did enjoy Shiver, and plan to read the rest of the series, but am hoping that future Stiefvater work is elevated to the level she presented in The Scorpio Races. It's kind of hard to go back to `pretty good' after you've achieved `excellent' (also see: why I'm not sure I'll ever read anything else J.K. Rowling publishes even though I'm sure it will be all well and good).can overlook this trope every so often when I enjoy the story.<br /><br />I do kind of wish that I had finished Shiver before reading The Scorpio Races, because quite frankly that book was so much better it hurts.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Just watched this last night and although not a huge Brad Pitt fan (like some of his stuff, but not all) I thought his acting was stellar. All the acting was great and as a true story it really hit home as I remember those years and the film showed us what many of us didnt know at that time.<br /><br />The final part with his daughter singing was great and showed Billy cared more about just about everything except getting a huge paycheck which is very refreshing nowadays as most only care about how much money they make....Billy proved he cares more about family, ethics, morals and community then he did about money...<br /><br />Very refreshing film...if you like baseball or dont, you should still like this movie...at least most will......

B003Y5H5B0|1.0|I watched this movie searching for anything that might remain true to the series that I loved when I was younger.  I found nothing. I found less than nothing actually. I was so heartbroken that they took this amazing show that covered such a wide range of important and relevant  issues like drug abuse, gangs, teenage sex, and domestic violence and turned it into a series of bad jokes and slapstick moments for brain dead jerks.  If a negative rating was possible then this movie would deserve it. If you are a true fan of the show and it's message please don't waste your time with this sorry knock off brain dead movie.

B0077ATSZE|1.0|This is a terrible movie. Please try to ignore all of the comments talking about 9/11...the fact that the story revolves around that tragedy DOES NOT MAKE THE MOVIE ANY BETTER!!! Please try to ignore the comments by people who know someone with Asperger's...the fact that we should all be compassionate and understanding DOES NOT MAKE THE MOVIE ANY BETTER!!!<br /><br />The writing in this movie is atrocious. There are so many unrealistic scenes in this movie. People do not respond to strange kids at their door the way they do in this movie. The writing is lazy, and the acting is lame. The kid is good, and from what I gather, he does a good job emulating a boy with Asperger's. That being said, that is probably the only positive in the entire movie. Too many mindless, poorly written scenes, too many shortcuts just to try to make a point without making it realistic. Again, remove the 9/11 aspect from the film, and you remove 1/2 of the positive reviews.<br /><br />I was thoroughly disappointed in this film. Total hype.
0739359320|4.0|John Grisham doesn't disappoint in this book about a search for an heir to a billionaire's fortune.<br />The first chapter took me by surprise as a grumpy sick billionaire jumps to his death after signing his Will, surprising his heirs.<br /><br />He takes a simple story of family fighting over money in court into a entertaining adventure through South America with a slightly redeeming end to the story. It is a quick and easy read. If you were a fan of Grisham, you will still be when you finish this book.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Usually the second part of three in a series leaves you wanting more and just sets up the finale.  I feel this book really holds its own and keeps you reading in true hunger games fashion. It moves really quickly, and as always I wish it was longer, but it's great.  Familiar characters are further developed, and the new ones are cool too. Viva la rebellion!

The only knowledge I had of the book was that it's BDSM, which scared me a bit. I went into it with an open mind, not expecting much. I had no idea what I was in for, I could not put it down. I read it in less than 48 hours, staying up until 2am telling myself \\"Just 1 more chapter...Just 1 more chapter!\\".<br /><br />I've seen so many reviews talking about how poorly written it is. Perhaps I'm no literary genius, but no other book has ever completely captivated me & sucked me in like this has. Ever.<br /><br />Yes, there's some pretty freaky-deaky stuff in this book. However, there IS an amazing story behind it all.<br /><br />I'm taking it much more slowly with 2 book (which I think I may love even more than the first book) because I just don't want this story to ever end. I'm so glad I decided to ignore the reviews of cheesy (okay, there are some cheesy parts), horrible writing, and give it a chance. I have not finished the trilogy yet, but I believe this may be the best trilogy I have ever read. I encourage you to go in with an open mind and form your own opinion. Personally, I loved it and I'm quite obsessed.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|I have to say this wasn't one of the first P!nk Cd's I got, In fact it was the last. But P!nk really does it on this one! All the tracks are amazing! From the Big bad Trouble, to the party rock God Is A DJ, to the dark Last To Know, To the fun and happy song Tonight's The Night, To the rap song with Peaches Oh My God, with the 80's bar/club song, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, The epic and emotional Waiting For Love, The sad rock song, Save My Life, With the overpowering true song, Try Too Hard, with the fast upbeat song Humble Neighborhoods,the hard put down song Walk Away and evryone needs a western rock 'n roll song like Unwind, right? To the emotionally intense, sweet and peaceful Lovesong, and ending with a hidden track, a put down to sell-out stars, Hooker, which is one of my favorites. :)<br />So if you're a P!nk fan, you need to hear and GET this album! It's truley amazing! <3
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is a compact, easily deployed GPS unit on a USB cable. It offers high accuracy and ease of use at a surprisingly affordable price.<br /><br />Pros<br />* GPS-enables older laptops and other USB host devices that otherwise have been left behind in the rush to add geolocation functionality<br />* Setup is easy (install the driver and information utility using the supplied CD, plug in the GPS, and begin using it with GPS-aware apps)<br />* Accuracy is great, apparently to better than 3 meters<br />* Data feed rate is sufficient to operate it smoothly at interstate highway speeds (75mph)<br />* Weight is negligible (2.3 oz), which means that portability and deployment are very easy (for instance, hanging it by a bent paperclip or something from a sunroof is quite possible and easy)<br /><br />Cons<br />* Lower-level access (via COM ports) is annoying but necessary for certain apps. Just be aware that it may not necessarily show up on the same port each time, even if it is plugged into the same physical USB port. Use the driver utility to find it, if needed.<br />* The supplied USB cable is 60\\", which necessitates (in my vehicle) a direct route to the roof or dash, rather than snaking it more safely along the floor or seat back. I added a short USB extension cable to permit greater options for routing the cable. The data transfer isn't so high that a longer cable will harm it.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br />I've long wanted to GPS-enable my laptop, and finally the stars aligned once I found gmap catcher (software), the GPS daemon, and this GPS hardware. Enabling it to work with gmap catcher was some effort, involving installing and configuring the GPS daemon (Windows version), then determining the exact order of when to plug in the GPS, which app to run first (the daemon), then running the map program. Notably, the GPS info program hogs the port and the daemon can't send the data to two apps. So if you choose this approach, make sure you just use one at a time.<br /><br />Accuracy is excellent. I placed the receiver on a windowsill in my second-story office, and the GPS \\"target\\" spot in the map program correctly centered at the NE corner of my house (where the office is). I walked across the house to the deck, and could watch the spot follow me despite being inside with scant views to windows, and the location spot ended up on the SW side where the deck is, outdoors. It's difficult to say what the real accuracy is, but with WAAS enabled, it appears to be accurate to 3m and that's not with very good exposure, either. Later, with pretty good exposure (around 200° with some ground clutter such as other houses and trees), it locked on essentially immediately to no fewer than 7 satellites. I'm used to a hand-held Garmin which takes 15 seconds or so to get signal from four or so. This is practically instantaneous.><br />Accuracy is excellent.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|Snuggling up on the couch with my little angels and watching this childish adventure film was a delight, even if there is a disconnect really between the audience and the film.  Tin Tin is a fun film and the action is here in spades, but somewhere between one action scene and the next there is a seeming emptiness that needed some sort of filling.  The basic premise is one of sheer adventure, and as such this film really works.  The brisk pacing keeps everyone on the edge of their seat and the visual effects are beautifully composed to keep us entertained.  I'm a little shocked they decided to do a stop-motion film when there is nothing here that they couldn't have shot live-action, and it may have even been more exciting in that context.  Still, the main issue with Tin Tin is that the film never breathes.  It's like everything is thrown at the viewer in a barrage of sequences, but nothing is given a moment to just relax and take any real shape.  I liked this, but I was expecting something more balanced, less stuffy.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|amazon should require dev. to include info of how much space is needed.  its pretty much bs that people have to buy the game to figure out how much storage is required.  its deceptive to say its a couple megs and then you buy the game not knowing if there is an additional 500mb or 700mb or wtf!  whats the big deal? let us know so we can manage our kindle fires ridiculous memory space!
B004EPYZUS|3.0|Sadly, ever since Brian De Palma directed the original `Mission: Impossible' film back in 1996, the franchise has taken a nosedive.  The first film was so inspired and so dark; using subtlety in place of over the top action sequences in order to create a truly grounded and organic film.  Sure, there were moments of extreme peril (who can forget that droplet of sweat) and there were extreme action scenes (that helicopter sequence was staggering) but they didn't feel like gimmicks.  Then we had `Mission: Impossible II', directed by John Woo.  This was a straight up action flick with some superb moments, but overall the film ranks second place to its soundtrack, and that is never a good thing.  When I initially saw the J.J. Abrams helmed third installment, I found it compelling and thought for a brief moment that it balanced the stealth of the original with the action of the second rather well.  It has since faded and became, in my esteem, the worst of the franchise, despite a rather devilish turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />So that brings us to Brad Bird's `Ghost Protocol'.  Yes, that Brad Bird, the guy who directs Pixar cartoons.<br /><br />`Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol' once again feels strained.  The plot itself becomes null and void because it struggles to make sense, and the action scenes are so over the top they can come across bizarre, but what Bird does well here is grapple with the balance of serious and humor that makes the film all the more `fun'.  Maybe this has to do with his grasp of animated fare and the understanding of mood, but I found that this film didn't take itself as seriously as Woo's or Abrams' films and so it felt better on my stomach.  I understand that it is ridiculous, but I embraced it because it wasn't forced down my throat.  The visual effects are amazing, especially that glass building climb sequence, and the sand storm is ravishing (if unnecessary).  The acting is kind of bad, especially Paula Patton who goes all Beyonce at one point and I felt like I was watching `Obsessed', but you aren't watching this for the acting; right?  In the scope of the series, I can't rate this yet.  Initially I'd place it second, but I have a feeling in time it'll fall to third.  The first two films, while wildly different in tone, stick to their strengths.  I want someone to blend the two to perfection, but as of yet that hasn't happened.ce at one point and I felt like I was watching `Obsessed', but you aren't watching this for the acting; right?

B007QNRMUU|4.0|After trying different songs and styles over the past 4 years, Jason Mraz comes up with an album that is very different from his previous offerings yet still succeeds in delivering a satisfying sound.<br /><br />If you're looking for the upbeat and fast-paced funk of We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, you won't find it here. That may be the biggest problem for his thousands of fans. This album is definitely more subdued than his other efforts. The risqué lyrics and fun wordplay that many fans have come to love aren't on this album - yet the song writing on this album seems more focused on its goal.<br /><br />The production on Love Is a Four Letter Word is very smooth - lush strings come in to add those touches, the horns are not in your face (with the exception of The Freedom Song) and the harmonies are light and airy. With the exception of voice, guitar and drums, every instrument comes and goes very discreetly, adding their touches when needed but without fanfare. This can both be a blessing and a curse, as it sometimes sounds like the soul of a song has been smothered by the production. Here we find an album about Love that talks about love but never quite hits the emotional peaks and lows that love brings about.<br /><br />This is typical of most Mraz albums however - songs on a Mraz album rarely sound like they do when performed live. This is perhaps the curse of being an artist who can pull lyrics out of thin air with a melody that lingers - a produced album never sounds \\"live\\".<br /><br />Fans who want to know that Jason hasn't lost his fun live style should buy the Deluxe version which features live tracks of songs that didn't make the album and showcase that fun. That version also includes a demo version of \\"I Won't Give Up\\", the first single.<br /><br />Certain songs do feel like they were \\"required\\" by the label: Living In The Moment sounds like a throw-away to I'm Yours, Mraz' biggest hit from the last album; Everything Is Sound also sounds like it was based on some of his earlier music, yet toned down. The songs all carry a positive message - it's better to write about love and positivity than hate and negativity - yet a lot of the lyrics show a sincere earnestness that comes with knowing, getting and losing love.<br /><br />At some times, the album takes on a country feel (Living in the Moment and Frank D Fixer); at other times, it sounds like the roots-rock of the 70s (Who's Thinking About You Now, Be Honest) and sometimes like jazz (5/6). A hidden track \\"I'm Coming Over\\" sounds like Paul Simon. Rather than a \\"party\\" album, it's a \\"cruising\\" album, the kind of album you want to put on for a relaxing afternoon or a dinner party. In fact, the album may garner more fans from the over-30 audience than from the younger generation.<br /><br />This album doesn't have hits written all over it. While most songs can stand on their own, none sound like break-away hits.<br />This is a more mature-sounding Mraz, grappling with a universal topic, expressed in a harmless, uneventful way. Yet the album grows stronger and stronger on every listen, with something for everyone. In the end, to borrow a phrase from I Won't Give Up, the album knows \\"it's worth it\\".
B007J4T2G8|1.0|1.5 stars...<br /><br />About 1/2 through I wanted to PUNCH HER INNER GODDESS IN THE FACE!!!!<br /><br />She repeated so many words over and over and over again.<br /><br />IMO trying to read Fifty Shades of Grey was like trying to read tweets by Courtney Stodden - meaning it read like a teenager trying to act like/talk like an adult.<br /><br />I have read BDSM books that were well written and seemed tell a better love story. This book needed to be edited with a heavy hand and revamped! (haha)<br /><br />It wasn't the worst book I've ever read but that isn't saying much. I didn't connect with Anna at all I found her annoying and unbelievably naive. I find it hard to believe that a 21 yr old sr in college thought the way she did. If she was on a secluded island with no outside influence for 21 yrs maybe I could have understood. It's not that she didn't know about BDSM I get that, but she never ever explored anything not even her feelings or interest.
B004LWZW88|4.0|YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT MOOD FOR THIS LITTLE ROMP WITH PUSS AND BOOTS, BUT I FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL.  IT DOES PUT A DEFINITE TWIST ON THE CHARACTERS OF HUMPTY DUMPTY, JACK AND JILL/JACK IN THE BEANSTOCK BUT ALL TO THE GOOD.  EVEN THE ROMANTIC INTERLUDE FOR PUSS IS VERY GOOD.  PUSS' VOICE IS TERRIFIC AND IT HAS A SPANISH SETTING, FITTING ANTONIO'S ACCENT.  I LIKED IT, MY HUSBAND TOLERATED IT AND MY GRANDKIDS LOVED IT.
B00571F26Y|1.0|The science that this \\"doctor\\" quotes is largely just the fallacy of \\"appeal to emotion''. intermixed with other real doctors research.<br />[...]<br />For a self help book written by a doctor, this man hates fat people, and glosses over any proven arguments in favor of his unfounded unscientific opinion, \\"Wheat is bad, mmkay.\\" and writes this book with the proven facts of. \\"I lost twenty five pounds by eating, the atkins/paleo/gluten free diet, here's what I ate. \\"<br /><br /> Proof of his gluten free miracle working is given by the accounts of patients to himself, with no actual monitor of his or their claims to following a gluten free diet, evidence that any one was overweight, or in poor health.  Who trusts a doctor who can't keep their patients confidentiality by writing a book filled with, \\"This one time a patient had problems, and I said fatty stop eating wheat, and they did. Plus they started wrestling grizzlies and fighting Russian's for the leadership of middle earth and they won! I'm awesome!\\"<br /><br />The  hippocratic oath to do no harm was broken when he wrote this book and charged money for it.  I guess it's, 98% of the Doctors who make the other 2% look bad nowadays.<br />He wrote this book to steal money. I'm serious this book is written like the college essay from that dumb guy, who repeats everything three or more times because in a frat house,  while drinking beer, someone very high once said, \\"The best way to sell something is to use the Green Eggs and Ham approach.\\",  not to have product that has intrinsic market value.

This was a great free app, but is also well worth the asking price.

While sitting in the theater you realize your not alone everyone is doing the same thing,cheering and enjoying this \\"MOVIE\\". Then it hits you, you have got to see it again. As the credits roll,the many hands of the full house(ticket sales) are clapping and the cheering still continues. Realization hits of how good this movie made you feel,then I have hear someone worry about the quality of the acting,didn't the the ones doing the review see that swift boat rescue \\"WHIPLASH COMING IN HOT !!!!\\" Several stood up and cheered in the theater.So walk outside get your use to sunlight,get through the traffic,feeling good and safe knowing all the Seal Teams are keeping my family and me safe as well as my country not letting acting ability get in the way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't understand the bad reviews at all.  I read the trilogy.  Couldn't put them down and am going over them once again as I read so fast I'm sure I missed a great deal.  The sex was a shock at first, as I've never read that type of book before (at least about sadist sex), however when I was able to get past that the story line was excellent.  A real page turner to find out what happens next.  The sex did get a bit boring by the end of the third book and really I could have done without most of it, but then I'm an older woman who comes from a different generation.  All in all, I loved the book and the happy ending.  I'm already looking for another from that author.
0439023521|5.0|I decided to read THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy after seeing (and loving) the movie.  I thought the characters were fleshed out really well in the film and the quick pace of the plot moved the story along very quickly.  It made me want to know and learn more...right away.  I bought all three books and dove right in.<br /><br />The first, THE HUNGER GAMES, is a combination of [[ASIN:0399537422 Lord of the Flies]] and the reality TV show [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor]].  Kids from a futuristic society are chosen from twelve \\"districts\\" to fight to the death in yearly games set up by the wealthy and privileged who live in the \\"Capitol.\\"  It's purposely unclear when this futuristic society takes place, unlike the very specific [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]] by George Orwell.<br /><br />I was glad, though, that I saw the movie before reading the book.  It made the movie that much more thrilling, because I didn't know what was going to happen during the Games or where the story was going.  I truly was surprised...and amazed.  The book, however, answered some of my questions that came up during the movie.  It reveals a more insights into the Games, the Capitol, the world where Katniss and Peeta live, and the origin of some things in that world.<br /><br />There were very little differences between the book and the movie, but I thought the movie did a better job of portraying the excitement and terror of the games.  And, visually, it was just stunning.<br /><br />One thing I noticed in the book was that it was overly detailed with its descriptions of food, and sometimes that was a bit off-putting.  Obviously, I know why there were these inclusions (it's in the title!), but it seemed like Katniss was constantly counting up her food supply and describing each and every thing that she ate in too much detail.  For me, it made the story drag a little.<br /><br />All in all, though, I loved the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES and the whole futuristic society that Suzanne Collins put together.  I'm looking forward to jumping right into the second book, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]].t together.  I'm looking forward to jumping right into the second book, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]].
0765367297|5.0|I purchased this book for one of my grandsons. He would rather not read; but reading about something he loves to do on his XBox was a way for him to begin the \\"joy of reading\\". I ordered another Halo book for him this week, and he is now reading it.

I read the Bible frequently, while sitting in a doctors office, or sitting at my children's school waiting to take them home. If there is a version that will allow me to read whenever I feel the urge I would download it post haste. None the less, I totaly enjoy the Youversion Bible app.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a great read. Despite the fact that the characters are in college, adults will enjoy this read. Funny, quirky, pulling at heartstrings. It's a work of fiction, critics. That means it may not be a complete reality. So what? It's  definitely worth the money I paid for it.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|Boy, how can I write an original review of \\"Superman: The Movie\\"?  Just about everyone knows about this guy: where he's from, what he can do, what makes him tick.  If somehow you don't know, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" will spell it out for you. I guess the best I can do is focus upon how our love and need for \\"Superheroes\\" is stronger than our urge to insult them.<br /><br />Of all the things in the world to satirize, you would think superheroes would be among the easiest.  Come on, vain, self-important, overconfident, naive jerks wearing colored underwear running around getting into trouble while fighting bad people and stopping bad things from happening (and all without getting paid)?  What a joke!  And yet, in my opinion, when movie directors take a satirical approach to a superhero movie, they usually turn out an unmemorable, unsuccessful product.  Why?  I think it's because, deep down, we want to believe in and respect superheroes and their admirably unselfish goal to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This is why \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (hereafter STM) got it right.  Especially in our cynical times, it is sort of tempting to make merciless fun of a near-perfect demigod who really does care for all people and fights ceaselessly to protect them.  STM does not.  Yeah, it needles some aspects of the Superman mythos (e.g. telephone booths you can't fit into, Clark not even feeling the collision of a taxi that gets damaged, Lex Luthor's elaborate real estate plot, Lex Luthor's inept henchman Otis), but it does so with gentle kidding.  Instead, STM takes the time to introduce Superman from the beginning, from his origins on Krypton to his interactions with the Daily Planet staff and especially his offbeat romance with the flinty, independent Lois Lane.  We learn more about Superman than just the \\"Super\\" part - his wonderful powers, abilities, and weaknesses.  We learn about the \\"man\\" part too - his values, his objectives, his hopes, his fears,and his kind, courageous heart.<br /><br />Superman has been called the \\"Man of Steel\\", but he has also been called \\"The Man of Tomorrow\\", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures.  I think STM acknowledges this, and hints that all the action, special effects, adventure, and battles of any superhero movie are meaningless unless we respect and believe in the \\"S\\" - not just Superman, but also the \\"S\\" we all potentially have underneath.heart.<br /><br />Superman has been called the \\"Man of Steel\\", but he has also been called \\"The Man of Tomorrow\\", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures.

E L James please keep the books coming because if this is what we can expect, I want more!

Definitely something I'll be watching with my future children, and I hope it gets passed on since it's much more meaningful then most movies.
1609611543|5.0|Ok, there cannot be one single American who has not heard that carbs=FAT.  That is carbs from sugar, carbs from pasta, carbs from fruit, carbs from alcohol, and carbs from bread.  They all turn to sugar in our bodies and then we get fat.  DUH!?!?<br /><br />The compelling part of this book (to me) was exactly the same thing I have been saying for years just based on thinking back and putting the pieces together -  if you think back to the time when everyone all of a sudden started getting really FAT, it was around the time they started adding high fructose corn syrup to everything, and changed the food manufacturing process to eliminate \\"whole\\" oils/fats and replaced them with hydrogenated ones.  It ties in exactly with this book's statement that wheat was genetically modified and started causing health problems that are reaching epidemic proportions.  These changes all happened around the same timeframe, which has added up to a big disaster health-wise.  It is interesting to me because I just watched a LONG show about sugar being toxic, from this Pediatrician Doctor who is aligned with the American Heart Association, and he really skipped over the whole \\"wheat\\" thing, skipped over the whole \\"fat\\" thing, except to state that fats are basically neutral.  Sugar is toxic.  Wheat is just as bad, and hopefully more people will begin to \\"get it\\".  Kind of an inconvenient truth, but that phrase has already been taken!<br /><br />I was kinda wondering when all this information is going to end up in one book, when I bought and read this one.  Wheat Belly does go on and on, and sometimes it can sound like a conspiracy theory, just like if you read up on Coconut Oil, which is now being resurrected as a healthy and safe fat after years of anti-marketing to scare everyone to death of eating it!<br /><br />Is is any wonder that our kids are so overweight?  Even the very young athletic, active groups of dancers, basketball players, football players, and kids who just get out and run and run...can they all really be eating so much more than my brother and I did back in the 60's and 70's?  I could eat like there was no tomorrow, and other than playing outside like any other kid, I was skinny and all the other kids were skinny!  The \\"fat\\" kids weren't even \\"that\\" fat, compared to what is basically \\"normal\\" now.  As a parent, I am taking HUGE strides to make sure my kids don't fall prey to getting hooked into a lifetime of diabetes or obesity.  The more I read about the food that is commonly available, the more scared and upset I get!  Yes, it is a PAIN in the arse to go against the flow.  But try going with your kid to breakfast or lunch at any school, and you will be horrified.  There is so little for them to chose from that is even worth eating.  I went to my 5 year old's school to eat breakfast with him, and here is what we could chose:  Frosted Pop Tarts (sugar), white bagel - the size of my hand (sugar),  cereals: rice krispies, lucky charms, apple jacks, cheerios (sugar), banana (sugar), skim milk (sugar), apple and orange juice (sugar).  The only thing that was real food (or anything close to it) was the little container of peanut butter for the bagels (made, of course, with hydrogenated oil), cream cheese and butter.  Cream cheese and BUTTER was the only thing that wasn't totally sugar or garbage.  Sigh.<br /><br />Pass the book along and maybe one day people will wake up and accept the truth.  Don't expect the food pyramid or the government to tell you what is \\"healthy\\".
B003L20IJM|5.0|This sequel is the first Nanny McPhee movie I saw with my kids, prompting me to buy the first movie as well. While my kids say they like both movies equally, I strongly prefer this one, Nanny McPhee Returns, as it is lighter and and cheerier. Maggie Gyllenhaal is great as the single mom struggling to keep her property, amidst a visit from two snooty young relatives who don't mix too well with her kids. Silliness and fun. The first movie seemed a bit dark to me.

B005NFJAZS|5.0|we bought this for our 5- and 8-year-old grandchildren, both boys. they didn't care much for the so-called girly-parts (marian's ballad esp) but they BOTH embraced the rest of the movie and have been singing many of the songs.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|What can i say other than buy this thing. i have owned several headphone amps and they do the trick honestly. they provide the lacking power all your devices need. It comes in 3 settings represented by either a blue red or purple/mixed light appearing from a small little hole not the top right clear corner. the settings are all useful based on your taste and your headphones. for their price they cannot be beat seriously they cant when headphone amps go for $100+. the fiio is easy to use and charges very quickly they. the Fiio is fantastic if you really need it.

B005GTLPPY|4.0|This book gives a nice overview of the recent findings in the exciting field of epigenetics. It is the perfect book for those who want to have a introduction to the broad variety of studies that are currently done. It is however, not a book for those who have no understanding of basic biology.
0307951529|4.0|When you read about starting your own business, a lot of the books make it sound like you just do X, Y and Z and ta-da, you have your own business. This raises the question of why we don't just all work for ourselves. At the other end, some books can be downright discouraging. The $100 Startup strikes a good balance. I especially like the basic formula it presents for what you need to make a working business. I'll oversimplify it just a little bit: 1) A Product or Service, 2) Customers who can find it and 3) A way to get paid. The other all-important point is that if you're going to run a hobby/interest based business, you have to think in terms of your customers' hobbies and interests, not your own. That is, you have to run a real business, not just do what you love and let the money follow.<br /><br />The suggestions in the book and the anecdotes it presents are great for thinking about how to start your own business on the side. However, the title overpromises a little, I think. One of the first entrepreneurs accidentally became a mattress salesman when he bought up some discontinued mattresses to sell on Craigslist and set up shop for cheap in a former car dealership. It's an impressive story of how an unemployed guy found a new line of work, working for himself. But it doesn't sound like $100 proposition. Within the book, it's acknowledged that while $100 is a desirable figure, starting capital for some of the case studies may run a little more than $1000. Not bad, and extremely encouraging if you want to try to create a new business but are limited in the commitment you can make. But the appeal of the $100 startup, to me, was that it would show you how to dip your toe in the water and give a business idea a try when you really weren't in a financial position to strike out on your own.<br /><br />Had this book been called the $500 start-up, I'd say that's a fair title. But it's also a title that would have been at least a little less likely to pique my interest. If you're interested in a good introduction to starting your own business without a lot of resources, this is a great book. But four stars instead of five because the title oversells it.
B000H4JGZY|5.0|Great cd, Wanted to add it to my JT collection. Came in great condition!! My favorite song is Sexy Back! And Losing my way, also has a great meaning behind it, \\"true story\\". But overall the albulm deals with some of the problems we face in life. He is such a talented artist!!
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I agree with a previous reviewer about the excessive quick cut edits from close-ups of Joe's hands during a solo to a sudden shift to the back of the bar and then to the bass player, who gets far too much screen time.  The bass player is the cheerleader, geting the audience worked up, claping along, etc, but this is not why people come to see Joe Bonamassa or buy his DVDs. It's like Kix Brooks used to do in Brooks and Dunn.  Who cares?  Joe's playing is masterful to say the least, though it can be derivative (it's the blues - not too much room for originality). A well-studied guitarist can hear Eric Clapton, Eric Johnson, and Gary Moore's licks dominating Joe's playing. Nothing wrong with that - he may play their styles better than they do! I highly recommend his new \\"Live at the Beacon Theater\\" to see a more matured Bonamassa in action.  For this DVD Five-Stars for excellent musicianship, Two-Stars for over zealous editing.

0345803485|1.0|I just dont know where to start, maybe because I never write reviews but if I can save someone $11 I will try.<br /><br />This book is torture.  Not sure who had it worse, Anastacia (which is a very annoying name when you have to read 32 times a page) or the reader! I think what got me was the lack of reality - yes I know its fiction but the girl is a virgin on page 1 and by golly by page 75 she is coming like a porn star at the drop of a hat.  Oh and come she does, heck a flip of a whip \\"on her sex\\" and her body is going into earth shaddering orgasms - the girl comes when the wind blows - I got so bored with it I didnt care if she was coming or going.  The sex scenes got so repetitve I couldnt wait for them to be over - I skimmed through them waiting for something interesting to finally happen.  I figured it would eventually - well, it didn't.  I finished it though!  It blows my mind that this book sells so many copies! and how the 2nd one sells any is beyond me! if you do get your hands on a copy - save yourself some time and read up until the 2nd sex scene ends, and jump to the last chapter - and just imagine about 76 other sex scenes of your own in your head in between - I think you will find it a lot more enjoyable! Although you probably won't come as much as Anastacia does - but I am not sure there is anyone who does.<br /><br />Reading any of the Fifty Shade Series = Hard Limit
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Really fun! but when you want to exit the game you cant BUT THERE IS A WAY TO EXIT!!its just annoying and hard to find. YOU must go to setting and click the bottom of the screen like you would any other app to exit. hope this helps every one!

B007SYWFRM|3.0|I really liked this game but, it kept on force closing on me after a while and now it won't stop saying &quot;ice age village isn't responding&quot; force close.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am not someone who usually enjoys a lot of fiction books.  Didnt make it through book four of Twilight, but there is just something abuot Katniss Everdean that I could not put down.  I opened this book the week of finals and would read into all hours of the night after finishing my studying.  The picture that Suzanne Collins paints is so vivid, its like your one of the members in the districts watching the Hunger Games unfold.
0689835604|1.0|This book is completely misleading. The entire plot revolves around finding Baby's belly button; the title makes this much clear from the beginning. However, there is no mystery. There is no twist. Baby's belly button is right where it's suppose to be, on Baby's stomach. Right where it clearly SHOWS you it is on the COVER OF THE BOOK.<br /><br />This plot is a complete mess as a result of it's reliance on the mystery of where the belly button is; everything falls apart the second you realize that the belly button was in plain sight all along. There is no conflict, there is no character development, and there is scarcely any plot. Whoever wrote this book must have a serious error in judgement, because you would have to be an infant to not immediately understand where Baby's belly button is. This is one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read.

B006ZDU7QI|4.0|My first experience hearing Gotye was radio airplay of \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", but at the time, no one announced who sang the song.  Then Saturday Night Live had him as their featured musician, and I immediately went online and bought the Making Mirrors album.  Even though I'd only heard one song, I liked the previews of the others enough to figure it was worth it.<br /><br />At his best, he has creatively-mixed harmonies and beats that sometimes remind me of Beck, and other times a little like Godley & Creme, and this is a good thing. Gotye definitely is creating his own sound, and Wally definitely has total creative control here.<br /><br />At the low points, I think that he could have used some recording engineering consultation because of the variation in volume where Gotye's voice is a barely-audible whisper to the crescendo chorus and instrumentals where it all is loud and clear.<br /><br />Everyone here has their own favorites. Mine include \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", the subtle \\"Bronte\\", \\"In Your Light\\", and the uplifting \\"I Feel Better\\".  I really wanted to like State of the Art, but autotune really, really, REALLY turns me off songs, though the chorus harmony was especially brilliant in this piece.<br /><br />Now I'll have to check out his last album before, \\"Like Drawing Blood\\", but what I'll really be looking forward to is his maturation and reaching out in his next album to come.

B000JIHP88|2.0|We purchased this mobile after seeing all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I guess we're in the minority. When the mobile arrived the music worked but the motor did not. We had to take it apart and fix it before we could get it to turn. Then, one of the leaves wouldn't work correctly (it stayed stuck in the up position unless you manually tapped on it). I also agree with other reviews about the music being a little too quiet. It's too bad because our daughter did seem to enjoy watching it turn. Anyway, this was a return item for us.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|Do not give this game to a child, or it could cost your hundreds of dollars.  This kind of app should be illegal.  The graphics are great and it is really sad they destroyed it with in game purchases of coins.  At the very least it should come with warnings.  Another problem is the app gets stuck in various screens and the only way to get out is to shut your Kindle down.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was a very good story. However, not being a teen-aged girl, I got very tired of everything being filtered through a teen-age girl's point of view. That detracted a lot from the story.

Kept me guessing who-done-it till the end, sign of a good mystery.<br />I thought it could have been edited down some,a bit draggy in the first few chapters, which is why I didn't give it five stars but past that, I didn't want it to end.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas with the Kindle Fire.  She is a Mahjong fan, and has spent probably 150 hours since Christmas on this product.  It continues to lock up, [even though Kindle has replaced 5 Fire products since Christmas because of these problems], it continues to not respond to clicks on the screen to choose a tile, it continues to be a bad product.  My wife still uses it, even though she is not happy at all with it.  Amazon continues to replace the Kindle Fires because of these problems.<br /><br />What do I think?  That is surely a terrible Christmas present for my wife.<br /><br />Please replace it, fix it, send it back to Mexico where it came from.  NO GOOD!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I finished this book last night.. and now I know the saying of \\"I feel like i've lost a friend\\". I won't say these are the best written books out there. They aren't suppose to be. I had so much fun reading them every day. I love books that go day by day. It makes it seem more real that way, like I know what they're doing every day. I never in a million years would have thought I would like these books.. let alone LOVE them! This is why I think everyone should give any book a chance.. it might surprise you. I love how this book played with your emotions. One minute I hated Christian and the next I loved him. You could totally feel the emotions through this book. I'm not sure what i'm going to do with myself now that i'm done. They were my first 5 star books of the year and I know I will have a hard time thinking about anything else but these books. So glad my book club suggested them.. otherwise I would have missed out on this wonderful trilogy.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This Mahjong has given us trouble since I bought it for my wife's Christmas present.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I would sent it back to Mexico where it was made and tell them that it is not worth anything.<br /><br />Amazon generally sells quality products.  This is a lousy product, and it damages Amazon's name for them to sell such a product.  We have had the Kindle Fire 5 months now, and the problems are not fixed.  I would delete it from the Apps section, and not sell/give it to anyone.  It would save Amazon money to do it.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|ice age village isnt good for the kindle fire. i was playing it and then i noticed that my pop up menu wasn't at the bottom of the screen. that means that i haad no way to exit this game. ( it wasn't a great game, anyway) i got outof this game by clicking an icon on the screen that had other apps that i might like. i clicked on one and it brought me to the app store where the pop up menu was there. so, if u have a kindle fire, i suggest u dont get this game.
0307454568|4.0|As with the first two books in the series, this book is fast paced, easy to read and keeps you curious about what is going to happen next. If you read the first two books and enjoyed them, then you have to read this book. I think it's slightly better than the Girl Who Played with Fire and not nearly as good as the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It felt more fast-paced, start to finish, than Fire - perhaps more on par with the second half of Fire - and like Fire, lacked the impact of Dragon.<br /><br />Unlike the first two books, there isn't really a big mystery that is being solved; it's more a mystery of how the story will unfold at the end. This isn't a bad thing, though. I couldn't put the book down, just like the other two, and couldn't wait to see how things eventually ended. Similar to the second book it continues to unwrap the mysteries of Salander, a character that you have to continue to explore if you're a fan of the series.<br /><br />As with Fire, I'm not sure how well this book would be able to stand on its own, but since it's both connected to Dragon and better than Fire the overall feel of the book is inflated - which I guess is a good thing for those of us who have read it. By itself, I'd probably give it 3-3.5 stars, but as a good conclusion to this thoroughly entertaining series, I'll give it 4 stars.
1594203334|4.0|I borrowed the audio version of this book from my library amd thoroughly emjoyed it. It is written in an interesting way, autobiographical, and i felt the parts about the author's life provided context and made it feel like a story.<br /><br />I entered into the book not planning t like it becauese I am pro attachment parenting and do not care at all about forcing my child to sleep through the night... What i liked about the book was the v different philosophy nd the princies behind why the French parent the way they do<br /><br />Though not really based on scientific research, the author does some form of research, and i found the book insightful ... But i have no idea how accurate it iw, it might be stereotypical, or thFrench people might be makng exaggerated claims that do not apply in their lives... but who doesn't?<br /><br />I you think you enjoy autobiographical stuff giving insights into different cultures, i think you can enjoy this book<br /><br />Incidentally, the author repeatedly refers to her husband and some other people as 'British'... All the English people i know dislike being referred to by that term and am surprised her husband did not object... Maybe because he grew up in Holland?

B0063IH60K|4.0|This version of solitaire works very well on my Kindle Fire. It looks great, has tons of options so you can change the way the cards look and are dealt. Fun app!
0307352145|3.0|The book reads well and can be read quickly, however, I'm somewhat disappointed in several areas. Perhaps some of this can be corrected in future editions. I read books like these to identify works I'd like my students to evaluate as part of their coursework.I am both an academic and have years of experience counseling and working with all manner of psychological types.  The Myers Briggs Type Indicator to which the author refers as a test is not a test. It is a common problem of nomenclature, and just because many people commit this error doesn't make it an accurate fact.  One cannot find the correct answer of one's psychological type through this indicator, but one can find the directional signal with some apparent strength.  It is just that, a directional signal. The instrument taker has to agree to the results. I've had quite a few takers who thought they should respond the way their boss would like and came out with totally meaningless results.  Which brings me to the second point, I did not see any basis given for the introversion of the introverts mentioned in the book, most of whom are deceased and predecease the Myers Briggs and many other psychological type instruments by decades. How does the author know these individuals are introverts; what's the basis for her assertion?  Then, she mentions the Trip to Abilene story which the Army uses and cites a source at the Army War College.  Shame on both of them for not insisting that credit for this tale go to Professor (Emeritus) Jerry Harvey of George Washington University.  The source is easily retrievable from the internet,and the story wasn't created to demonstrate introversion, but created to demonstrate that in group settings people may be swayed to keep their opinions to themselves. Most Federal Agencies used this tale as part of management and leadership training.  Think the Challenger disaster. The teaching point of groupthink belongs to both introverts and extroverts. Extroverts also agree with the opinions of others to meet their own agenda--even if it's just to keep from hurting someone's feelings or not irritate the boss.<br />I like the point the author makes early in the book; introversion and shyness do not necessarily occur in the same individual. Yet the remainder of the book emphasizes shyness often in its search to open introversion to inspection, and thus leaves the reader with the thought that introversion must indeed include shyness.  The Harvard University story resonates with my own experience and I have to say it's the first time someone has mentioned this in so publically available a forum.  I also like the research the author cites, but note that only currently viable research takes up the majority of the work.  I didn't see anything on the effect of maturity on introversion either, and I believe that the maturation process of all psychological types can affect their ability to use their type to good effect.  So, a few things which should be reviewed from an editorial process; overall don't make this the only book on introversion you read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very fun. I like that it is easy to play. You really don't have to buy anything to play. With time, the game gives you what you need.<br /><br />Update 6/14/12: I made it to level 50, have over 20 million coins, and just recently with the new update have gotten more acorns for free from teh scrat game and ice piles. I did win 100 one time, but was more likely to win coins (which I don't need). It has been fun movign things around to max the coins earned by each family. Mostly once you reach level 50 there is nothing left to do, no more expanding to do, no more families to add unless you buy acorns

B0076NAWWA|3.0|I had high hopes for this album, I really did. With a line-up that includes such greats as Steve Morse, Neal Morse and Mike Portnoy, how could it go wrong? Neal and Mike have worked together very successfully in the past, there was no reason to think that couldn't continue with Flying Colors. But now that I read that this group is the brainchild of some music executive rather than of the band members themselves, the source of the disappointment I felt upon hearing this through the first, second, and third times is easier to pinpoint.<br />A couple of reviewers mentioned Asia and they nailed it! Asia STUNK and the stench still burns as the very name of the band conjures up images of a faux, stage-managed \\"supergroup\\". Very little prog here for sure, just mostly a bunch of very commercial-sounding and very pedestrian pop-rock. Flying Colors opened full of promise, Blue Ocean and Shoulda Coulda Woulda are actually very decent and energetic songs. But then the downward slide comes with Kayla, a commercial 80s sounding piece if there ever was one. And that slide is not arrested until many songs later with the high speed All Falls Down. Then the band sort of redeems itself closing out with Infinite Fire, the only genuinely prog piece on the album.<br />In my opinion, Flying Colors doesn't measure up to the hype that heralded its release. But the four excellent tunes mentioned keep it from being a complete disaster and it's actually worth owning for the sake of having those. The CD is accompanied by a colorful and informative booklet containing pictures, lyrics, and all pertinent album information.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book (and the other two in the trilogy!).  I read all three in four days and was sad to see it end.  (Then I began reading them again!) I wasn't certain at first that I would enjoy the novel since this genre was pretty new to me, but I loved the intensity, evolving romance and sweetness of the two main characters.  I think both protagonists were multi-faceted and had many layers; both being well developed.  How wonderful to have not only a handsome, intelligent, brooding (rich!) man in need of a good woman to love him and free him from his demons, but to also have a strong, intelligent, powerful female lead!!!  Finally--no simpering, whiny girl in Ana.  There was wit and humor, and a poignant view into the human heart and heartache, redemption and true love.  The sex and romance was very hot!  I highly recommend this fun and titillating trilogy!  If you are looking for profound and esoteric high brow literature, look elsewhere--this is a sexy, fun romp through the world of Christian Grey.  Enjoy it--and breathe--if you can!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise. I was a bit hesitant to purchase at first, due to there being only a few reviews. But, I am glad that I bought it. It was well worth the price and time. For only $1.50 this book is a must buy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this trilogy. I loved the intensity, evolving romance and sweetness of Christian and Ana. Book Two continues on this fine story. There is wit and humor, mystery and a poignant view into the human heart and heartache, redemption and the true love of family and the right partner. The sex and romance was very hot! I highly recommend this fun and titillating trilogy! This is a sexy, fun--and darker-- romp through the world of Christian Grey and Ana.
0439023521|4.0|I read this book prior to seeing the movie and I was extremely surprised how good it was.  I'm 50+ and everything I was told and heard was that it was a book for a much younger generation - but I could not stop reading it.  It captivated my imagination.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Granted, not everyone will like this trilogy or genre style.  Everyone has different tastes.  I loved this book and was so sad to see it end, although the romantic in me was happy with the conclusion.  I wish she would write more!!  Truly, at the heart of it all, this trilogy is a wonderfully romantic story about true love. Yes, it's very sexual (hot and steamy!) but that becomes the background as you continue on into the lives of Christian and Ana. I couldn't stop reading. I had to come up for air before diving back in!  I believe the love story and romance only got sweeter with each novel.  Well written, well edited.  I enjoyed the humor in the emails and especially Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" comments!!  If you like the romance genre, you'll love this selection. Definitely for adults though.  Enjoy!

Since then I have built 5 kits ranging from Custom HG (Almost non-grade really), to Master Grade equivalent [[ASIN:B005ANCJTW Kotobukiya Armored Core Alicia Fine Scale Model Kit (White Pearl Version)]]with this kit being my first Real Grade Gunpla. I was quite impressed with the articulation of the frame and the detail involved.<br />The dry transfer decals have been fun, if a little taxing when you can't seem to place it just right. This has been the case especially when decals are square or rectangular shaped and must be applied to areas that are curved, areas that are smaller than the decal (like where the feet bend for example), or are applied over panel lines (I use a hobby knife to remove any excess decal that does not have the design on it along the panel line itself).<br />Fun kit to put together and with more detail than a Master Grade version,I definitely recommend picking this up. I will be getting to the other RGs that have been released once I get through my queue of 9 other kits I have waiting.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was having a lot of fun with this game up until today when like other reviewers, it went buggy!

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|From the first moment they met, Eva and Gideon felt an overwhelming attraction for each other. In due course, it will be one of the most passionately breathtaking relationships (the kind that you can't-live-without) that two people could ever experience in their lifetime. If you thought the `Fifty Shades' series could stimulate you, wait until you read this exceptional, well-written story.<br /><br />Eva is an assistant in a prominent advertising agency who recently moved from California to New York with her roommate Cary, so both could begin their newly relocated careers. Because she is unaccustomed to the city, she attempts to become acquainted with the location of her new job and the setup of the building. In familiarizing herself with the inside of the Crossfire high-rise building, and while helping a stranger gather her belongings from the floor, she stumbles across Gideon who is taking pleasure in watching her.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Eva, Gideon Cross, of Cross Industries, is a billionaire businessman and owner of the building. As he crouches down to her level, his magnificent body and beautifully sculptured features, along with his projected power, overwhelm Eva to the point of her falling back and landing flat on her ass. When he holds out his hand to help her up, it is then and there, when they physically touch, that they both know something penetratingly stimulating is stirring between them.<br /><br />However, they will eventually go their own way, until they meet up again a few days later at work when her boss, Mark, and she show up in Gideon's office with their request for proposal meeting. Upon entering, Eva is totally in shock when she sees Gideon. For you see, she did not know who he was when they first met.  After the meeting ends, Gideon requests Eva stay behind. In doing so, Gideon, the forth-right, ever-powerful alpha-male, makes his verbal advances towards Eva. Of course, she blows him off and they depart. But this will not end here. From this moment on, he will pursue her until he gets what he wants; and all he wants is Eva. And so the story continues...<br /><br />Hot desirous sex throughout, a spectacular developing relationship with dark, painful and heartbreaking moments, as well as the most erogenous passion imaginable; coupled with seriously traumatized characters, and you have one of the most alluring journeys ventured...stimulating read guaranteed! Highly Recommend!s moment on, he will pursue her until he gets what he wants; and all he wants is Eva.

0142419400|5.0|It's not often that I give a book 5 stars.  Since I read so many books, it really takes something special to catch my attention.  I was a little dubious about the title because I am not a big fan of gushy love stories or (deity-forbid) the seemingly inevitable prosaic love-triangle.  But do not be fooled; while this book does center on the relationship of two people, it is hardly mushy.  On the contrary, \\"Anna\\" is a delightfully realistic, hilarious rendition of a teenage girl's encounters with growing up.  Stephanie Perkins writes so well that the characters seem like your friends and you find yourself rooting for them, almost forgetting that their story is fictional.  The author perfectly captures the thoughts and feelings of the average teenage girl.  For example, when St. Clair trails off while telling Anna something, Anna's thoughts are \\"what what WHAT,\\" exactly the reaction of any frustrated girl.  And St. Clair! I am very tempted to use the words \\"hot,\\" \\"amazing,\\" and \\"swoon-worthy\\" right now.  Ms. Perkins has artfully crafted a male character that you immediately love but still get frustrated with, for he is not without his imperfections (which makes this book all the better 1).  All in all, this is one of the BEST teen romances and one of the best books I have ever read.  It makes me wish I could get amnesia where it is concerned because there is nothing like the feeling you get the first time you read an amazing book. So go and get it, but be careful when you start because you will not be able to put it down!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and if you don't. have it you should get it. p.s I think it does not include Internet.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my son has fallen in love with this game. he likes super mario for the wii and says this game is just like it. I think this game is fun myself
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I just finished Mockingjay and been thinking of how to rate this book. The first book was great. A good page turner. The second book as just as good. In the first two books the writer really never developed Katniss' character well. First she never learned from her mistakes. Second the first person view is kinda annoying when there are other elements in the story that needs to be told. I believe the author rushed the third book. I didn't rate the first two books as i have read all 3 books in the past few days So my review encompasses all three books.<br /><br />For the first book I would give it five stars since it was the first book. The story was well thought out and the characters developed well in it. There isn't too much gushy romance to hinder that the characters are in a life and death situation. I can see how this story could actually come true at some point in the future. Take for example back in the roman days when the Romans used gladiators for amusement or even used Christians in the ring for amusement. The problem I see is Katniss does not learn from her mistakes. After she truly learns that Peeta loves her unconditionally she should remedy that. We see that see does fall in love with Peeta but tries to refuse to believe it because of Gale. Katniss did show that she is capable of emotion when Rue dies.<br /><br />Now the second book I would give it four stars. The author kept with the fast pace action with a second hunger games. Now she did empress me with not going through all the preparation of Katniss in the second games as she did in the first book. That would have been boring. Katniss never really matured in the second book. She never learned from past mistakes and she showed no feelings much except on occasions. No one, not even people that have hard lives, shows so little emotion. Now the story was very interesting with what they call the quarter quell and that this time it wasn't children in the games but it was for entertainment to entertain thecapitol people.<br /><br />Finally, the last and worst book of the series. I can tell why it was rated lower than the first two. I give only 3 stars to this book making an average of a four for the series. Now the worst mistake was the first person view. Come on Katniss was either drugged or catatonic fro almost a third of the book. She always had to be updated on events which is bad. the readers have no idea whats happening and when. There are parts of the story that was either late or incorporated wrong in the book. I do believe the author rushed this book to the shelves and filled in a lot of drugged induced dreams to fill pages. Also towards the end the author needed a reason for Katniss to kill Coin. Well she went about it all wrong. Really what kind of military leader would let 14 year old child on the front lines of a war even as medics. Now Coin refused to let Katniss go to the capitol without some kind of combat training so then why did she let Prim go without it, just does not make any sense. The military now trains medics for combat in case they are in the middle of a battle. Prim had no military knowledge so why throw her in the battle to get killed? It served no purpose. There were ways to convince a teenage girl with a broken mind to kill Coin instead of Snow. Also whats the deal with Gale he just practically drops out of the picture. He wants so much to protect Katniss in the first book because he loves her so. I am sorry but he would have felt the same in the third book also about him leaving her mind broken and taking a good job, that does not sound like the Gale from the first book. Yes Gale realized Katniss chose Peeta over him but let Katniss see this and be the one to let Gale know. Also Peeta just drops out of the picture for a while too. Yes his mind was broken but was coming around, why didn't he help Katniss in anyway or that they heal their broken minds together. It shows in the end where they coped and yes the children helped and Katnissand Peeta was forever changed but they healed and lived a peaceful life. I just cant get over the author killing Prim when that was Katniss' main goal from the beginning. Katniss had little control over protecting the ones she loved but Prim was the main one. She left Prim in district 13 and that's where prim should have stayed. Prim could have been the one to help Katniss heal her broken mind.<br /><br />As an avid reader I cannot stop in the middle of a series. I have to know what happened to the characters but this series progressively went down hill especially for the third book. I had to give this book a 3 because I only gives 1's and 2's to the books i just can't stomach or finish. I was very disappointed in the third book a big letdown from the first. Yes life has its hardships but at least put some reality checks and balances in the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game it is so addictive you cant stop playing it!!! This game is so cool everyone is talking about it you have to get it and plus its free!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great fun and is very addictive.levels come pretty quickly so it feels like you're making some progress. Playing on my kindle fire and is working great.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|cute app for the kids but will not allow you to exit the game when you are done.  immediately removed from my device.  recommend you not waste your time.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is well worth every penny! I have had so much fun playing this game and it is quite lengthy. It is a perfect mix of puzzle and hidden objects game with mystery thrown in. The hint button is great giving you the option to use it when you need it instead of using a walk through. I recommend this game for anyone that likes puzzle walk through games.
B0076OUXBE|5.0|I enjoyed Defending The King immensely.<br /><br />I never understood the difficulties that Michael went though his entire adult life and probably most of his childhood every day.<br /><br />The book was very well written and exposed many things I was not aware of in his personal life and professional career.<br /><br />I also never knew how well loved he was around the world, not just the United States.<br /><br />Dr Moriarty did a great service to Michaels family, friends and music lovers around the world by writing this book.<br /><br />Chuck from Palm Coast, FL
B007SYWFRM|3.0|hi I like itt its. ok but farmville is better than evert thing in played. people say Omg I love this game I hate it a little Ps my rate is 3 stars
085738371X|5.0|I am now finishing up the last book in the Millennium Trilogy. After thoroughly enjoying the first book I wasn't expecting the second book to be as good as the first.  It was even better.  And the third book is even better than the second.  I enjoyed these books so much I'm sorry it has to come to an end.  These are some of the very best books I've read in a very long time.  You're missing out if you don't read these books.  They are truly OUTSTANDING!!
B001AQO3QA|2.0|The second, longer cut of Aliens is certainly major evidence for anyone wanting to make case that James Cameron is the worst blockbuster filmmaker ever.  Cameron introduces the two versions saying that he performs his much longer 247 minutes, noting that it takes 40 minutes to actually get to the colony where the aliens have destroyed the colonists.  The 40 minutes add nothing of substance; shots are needlessly prolonged; deleted scenes--deleted because they should have been--now make the film bloated.  I turned it off at 45 minutes. I could not take this stunning example of bad filmmaking any longer.  Alien holds up well--the newer version is almost exactly the same. Ridley Scott knows how to make a film.  Alien 3 loos better on blu-ray, but the third act goes completely out of control.  Don't know what David Fincher was thinking.  The film is very watchable.  Alien: Resurrection is basically like a Resident Evil film--it's all action, no characters and totally boring.  Some French guy I've never heard of directs.  His \\"improved\\" version, not a director's cut, he says, is actually worse than the theatrical release version.  Watching two of these films again and not watching all of the other two just made me want to see Blade Runner again.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies in this genre I have seen in some time.  Since I love the genre, this should be noted.  The sound track is a great compliment to the thrilling suspense and I adored the screen shots that actually allow the viewer to see the apparitions, not only guess at them.  I would higly recommend this movie to everybody.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very well made version, I have others that might look prettier but this is the one I always use!! Addictive and I can't put it down. I'm always reading or playing Solitaire!!
B005HP2JAM|2.0|I Bought this 3-D movie, becuase I love 3-D. However this Documentary is Terrible. the color is faded. the Explorers all all French with very heavy Accents I found it very difficult to pay attention. the 3-D is passible. But I will warn you all. It is not the 3-D that we are used to seeing at the movies. I could have Done a Much better Job with my 3-D Equipment.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a true page turner, there was never a good place to put the book down.  If I was not reading the book, I was thinking about it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have read a lot of Nicholas Sparks books. This is one of my favorites. I like to read his books because he has such strong characterizations. In this book he creates a strong link between each of the characters that you feel you are there with them as they go through what Sparks demands of them. This was one of those books that is hard to put down. I cannot wait for the movie to come out.
1439127700|5.0|Looking for a great book that combines the best and worst qualities of leaders during challenging times? I just started The Presidents Club and can't put it down. Working in the White House is a different world. Wonder what it's like to be in the most exclusive fraternity in the world? This book might offend people on both sides of the political spectrum but entertain all. It reminds us all that Presidents are still people and how they deal with crushing pressure could be a lesson for us all.
B0062P3392|4.0|The Killer Elite bears some loose connection to a book by the same name, which itself is billed as non-fiction and may have some connection to fact.  Let's dismiss the film's claim to being based on fact and see whether it is entertaining.  First, who are the killer elite of the title?  It should be Britain's famed SAS, some members of which are to be targeted by a small group of mercenaries hired by an Omani sheikh to get revenge for the deaths of his sons.  It may however be the mercenaries, who are to be seen as among the best in their particular line of work.  They include Jason Statham and, tangentially, Robert DeNiro.  But it may be a small \\"committee\\" of ex-SAS who include Clive Owen, who collectively are known as the \\"Feather Men\\".  The violent interplay between the latter two groups and especially between Statham and Owen is the heart of the movie.<br /><br />There are some outstanding fight scenes, some interesting developments in the plot, and excellent acting.  Here it should be mentioned that there is a love interest between Statham and Yvonne Strahovski (yes, the model and voice of Miranda in Mass Effect 2 and 3!) that works better than such things usually do in movies of this sort.  There is also a buddy thing going on between Statham and DeNiro, despite being of different generations, leading one to ask why DeNiro was picked for the part and why he chose to accept?  All this added to the fine cinematography makes this a movie that rises somewhat above its genre and is definitely entertaining.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|The film looks marvelous, and the plot is riveting & takes you along with no drag or slow parts.  Cruise is back in a big way!  The sound is killer!  The extras are fair.  I found out too late that BEST BUY has a 3rd disc exclusive on this title w/ over an hour more of extras, so immediately I ordered this one too.  The FX and look of this film are the best technology can muster and the images are gloriously sharp in detail.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great novel! Love story, confusion, war, politics.... Amazing! The twists and turns of this series is beyond anything i could have hoped for !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Truly I cannot figure out what all the fuss is about.  Are grown women really reading this book?  Poorly written and ridiculous.  If I had to read \\"my scalp prickled\\" one more time I was going to kill myself.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written and it hooks you from the first word.  Couldn't put it down.  I recommend it to anyone it is steamy but not too over the top.
1451626657|5.0|Catch-22 is a novel about the absurdity and self-perpetuating insanity of bureaucracies, particularly military bureaucracies. It's a comedic attack on the rules that such organizations make and self-centered people who make them. It's also a surprisingly poignant and powerful anti-war novel, one that questions the foundations of patriotism and obedience that lead soldiers to fight. It does this set, not in Korea or another unpopular war, but in the heart of World War II. I would also like to highly recommend another great read [[ASIN:1592994652 Roll Over, Hitler!]]

B006UN3FTY|5.0|When Mr and Ms Brown invited into their home a stowaway bear called Paddington, I don't think they, along with anybody, would have expected this marmalade-lover's adventures to have a great impact into their lives, and ours, nor that he would become, in our world that is, a popular character in children literature and British culture. Now I heard some cynical people around me (Mister and Miss Curry) calling Paddington Bear clumsy, dim-witted and the most stupid creature that the world has ever seen. However I think those cynical people are wrong and should take a note from this young bear's golden heart, decency and good manners.<br /><br />It is in this book that we get to find Paddington's first adventures around London as he experiences adventures at the theater, in the Underground (or Subway),in a large shop, at the beach and at his new home. It is in this book that we get to see the most recurring characters and locations that occur in the Paddington Bear series like Portobello Market, Mr Gruber and I am very pleased that the Kindle edition hs kept Peggy Fortnum's original ink illustrations, which I am very fond of for their energy and the clear expressions of the characters.<br /><br />In the end, this book is the first in the long classical series of Paddington Bear, who comes from Darkest Peru and who loves marmalade sandwiches.
B00005B9R4|5.0|Well my stubbornness in believing that albums released in the mid 60's are inconsistent affairs can finally be laid to rest knowing that both Highway 61 Revisited and this album are wonderful from beginning to end.<br /><br />\\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" has a vocal melody where you basically have to focus as hard as humanly possible to keep up with the lyrics, haha.  I could sit here and mention what these lyrics are about but, the truth is, I haven't a clue!  They explore so much territory that understanding the meaning behind them is too far of a stretch, so it's better to just focus on making out a few words at a time and take it from there.  VERY exhausting stuff.  Not a complaint though- I've adapted to Dylan's style of melody writing, his voice and his arrangements so with time my belief is that I *will* be able to make something out of this.<br /><br />\\"She Belongs To Me\\" is a beautiful blues/folk song about a girl who's \\"nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all\\".  \\"Maggie's Farm\\" has lyrics about everyone that Dylan works for at the farm being crooked!  Very imaginative and interesting lyrics, especially the brother who likes to nickel and dime you to death and fine you after you step out the door!  \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" reminds me of \\"If Not For You\\" but lyrically WAY more adventurous.  That's the main difference between the two songs.  \\"Outlaw Blues\\" is a heavy blues rocker- it's short, and the line \\"Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'- I just might tell you the truth\\" stands out the most.<br /><br />\\"On the Road Again\\" has wonderful lyrics about Dylan staying in an unsanitary environment and questioning the people who live there.  Hey I do the same thing when I visit dirty homes- keep that place neat if you're going to spend your entire life there, darn it!  \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" contain interesting lyrics about the Mayflower, landing in America, getting tossed in jail, and then going on an adventure.  The Columbus line at the end just makes the entire story totally fitting!  There's been several debates over the years which version of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is the best- this or the mystical-sounding Byrds version.  The truth is, since my mindset is focusing on lyrics these days moreso than in the past (hopefully because I'm growing smarter) at the present time I prefer the Dylan version.  Pop fans would prefer the Byrds version (I assume).  The lyrics are creatively sung and focus on outdoor adventures such as beaches and skies.<br /><br />\\"Gates of Eden\\" is a country song of sorts about cowboys going to the Gates of Eden.  Highly melodic but perhaps a step down lyrically from the rest of the material here.  Of course \\"a step down\\" means I'm still being blown away here- it's Dylan man!  \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is the CRAZIEST SONG OF DYLAN'S ENTIRE CAREER!  Lyrically there's a zero percent chance anyone in their right mind can keep up with the fast wordplay taking place here the first time they're exposed to it.  Maybe YOU can but me?  Not in a zillion years!  In fact I'd have a better chance memorizing a dictionary!  I seriously believe this is astronomically out of my league and I have no problem admitting such a fault, but who knows- with repeated listens I may be able to grasp 10% of the meaning behind these words, lol.  \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\" has a VERY strong vocal melody with a detection of sadness.  The lyrics about stealing blankets stand out to me.  Love this song.<br /><br />Overall, it's awesome but make sure your brain is locked-in for a neverending display of not always easily understandable lyrics!
0307454568|5.0|Surprising ending, of course. Stieg Larsson was a master of the plot. There will be novelists come and go, but Lisbeth was an unconventional heroine who was likeable to those who read about her. This will likely be turned into a lame movie (liked the tattoo one with Swedish subtitles - never saw the one with Daniel Craig, but he is totally unimpressive to me), but few books ever- will beat this book.
B003L20ICE|4.0|The Kids Are All Right is a story about two lesbian moms that basically live like a normal family raising their kids.  Well the comedy comes in the way they interact with, not only each other, but their own children whenever the kids ask them questions pertaining to their sexual preferences.<br /><br />This is done in a way that seems inoffensive and harmless (though I suppose it's up for interpretation whether it really is or not) and there's actually some pretty clever scenes such as, for example, the two moms questioning their sons sexual preferences and automatically assuming that he's chosen a man and that he has some explaining to do when the one mom accidentally walked into his bedroom and noticed he was watching male pornography on his computer, however it turns out the male porn belonged to the two moms so THEY were actually the ones who had to explain it, lol.  I'm referring to the kitchen scene near the beginning.  It's hilarious!  Talk about turning the tables!<br /><br />Anyway the storyline is about the kids wanting to find their biological father (the sperm doner) so they do a little searching and when they find him... well it turns out he's doing pretty good for himself and gets along with the kids but I wouldn't call it a GREAT relationship.  As the one mom accurately says, \\"he's too self-satisfied\\" and believes in doing things his own way which can easily be interpreted as \\"the lazy way\\" or \\"his way or the highway\\".<br /><br />Eventually we discover that the one mom has a thing for this man, so they find sneaky ways to hide their sexual relationship through a supposed \\"back yard decoration chore\\" that the mom volunteered for, even though it's pretty obvious to the people working in the back yard that some hanky panky is taking place between the mom and the sperm doner, lol.  This relationship is what begins the increase in quality for me.  Before this... I'd say the movie wasn't really anything special.  Now however, they have to keep this knowledge hidden from the moms lesbian partner.<br /><br />I had to take one point away because there's some mild downtime in the beginning when really nothing of interest happens.  No character or storyline development takes place for several minutes at a time, and the discussion between the biological father and his kids was alright but occasionally the victim of hit-or-miss in the jokes department.  The second half of the movie when the one mom suspects the other one of cheating on her, along with the Joni Mitchell dinner table sing-along segment (and I'll have them know I'm a straight man who loves Joni's music!) is another noteworthy segment.<br /><br />Overall, the Kids Are All Right is funny and it's even touching (especially near th end when the daughter goes off to college).  Most importantly -and the reason I watched it in the first place- it's just plain different.  I prefer originality so having a lesbian couple raise their children was definitely a new storyline feature to me.  Great movie.
1451648537|3.0|Walter Isaacson's in-depth biography of Steve Jobs provides a surprising view of one of the modern era's most prolific business leaders. While noone can dispute Jobs' penchant for initiating and sheparding the creations of  stellar products, his overbearing and antagonistic personality is always in the background through every page of this book. Jobs certainly possessed an enviable business pedigree before his recent unfortunate passing, but this prowess came via conflict with and belittling of those he worked around. Before reading this biography, I was saddened over Jobs' death, and somehow wanted to connect with one of the biggest forces behind the rise of the personal computer. Upon finishing Isaacson's no-holds-barred insight into Jobs, however, I am no longer envious of the man (if I ever was). And yet, I still possess a degree of respect for him despite his oft-noted personality shortcomings. More than just a look into the life of a leader, Isaacon's portrayal is a brilliant lesson in values. Is the creation of one of the world's most recognizable brands (a company that at times claims the top spot as the world's most valuable) an activity that merits insulting, abusing, or neglecting family and friends or ostracizing subordinates? Only those in Jobs' arena may know for sure. The rest of us may have to remain content with modest business accomplishments tempered by true respect, love, and admiration from our loved ones. It's hard to know if Steve Jobs ever gained the latter.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book and looking forward to the second one. The story between the 2 of them is great. There are some mixed reviews on it but you need to just read it for yourself and you be the judge.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|I like the spring action on the pliers and the blades are nice and sharp.<br /><br />I don't care for the slide buttons that stick out to unlock the blade, they are a bit tricky to push correctly and were a little sticky at first.<br /><br />This is a nice tool, but for just a little bit more money I would get the Leatherman Blast which I own and prefer.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Invincible is an incredible album from start to finish. The album contains different songs that give the feelings of foreboding, achievement, defiance, love, and happiness. Recommended to anyone who wants a different, interesting listening experience<br /><br />This reviewer's favorite tracks are:<br /><br /> 4) Moving Mountains<br /> 5) Am I Not Human?<br />12) Hypnotica<br />14) Protectors of the Earth<br />18) Tristan<br />20) Infinite Legends<br />21) To Glory
0385737955|5.0|This book took a while to get really into the book.It started out slightly slow introducing Thomas' character, but that is also an aspect I really liked. It sort of felt like you were experiencing the feeling of going into the Glade along with him. Right in the beginning, the characters already start using their own slang such as \\"Hey, look it's the Greenbean.\\" or \\"Need a new diaper, shuck-face?\\" (page 17) which takes a while to get used to, but it creates an illusion that you're actually in a totally different world. The author did an amazing job creating a dystopian society where everything was imagined by the author specifically for the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the parts where characters were getting attacked or any physical or emotional pain. Specifically, I really enjoyed the part where Thomas was trying to help Minho and Alby when they were stuck in the maze with the Grievers. It kept me awake at night reading page after page continuously. I could picture myself in the maze while reading this book and I with the descriptive language, I could feel what it would be like to be in Thomas' situation. I couldn't put the book down after passing through a couple of the slower chapters in the beginning.<br /><br />I felt like the author wanted to create the illusion that you were actually experiencing the story along with Thomas. The amount of information you know, Thomas knows. This leaves you wanting to keep turning the pages wanting to know what happens next or if you get any new information to answer the questions in your head.<br /><br />This book is a mix between the Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. It has the survival aspects of the Hunger Games and wanting to defy the creators of the Glade as Katniss wanted to defy the Capitol in the Hunger Games. The Maze Runner has the aspects of teens or children being on their own in a new world and creating their own new life. The Maze Runner is a dystopian style book which incorporates both those books together with it's own creativity and imagery behind the story.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I had three choices, get the \\"egg\\" from the Fox online store for about $100 with the promo code, the US release for about $60, or the UK release for about $30.... I got the the UK release. It is region free, and will play on US blu-ray players (I play mine on a US PS3). Besides that, it's the Alien anthology in hi def.... need I say more?!
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I thought this was a GREAT season.  The download was easy with a good price.  The video quality was High Def as advertised.  My only complaint is the \\"5.1 surround sound\\" advertised was not delivered.  Only 2 channel stereo....very disappointing on my 65\\" Home Theater surround sound system.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Such a fun time waster. Would love to see more levels added. Or at least another sequel. Way to go!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I really loved this app untill around level 32 all my crops and shops reset. they need to fix this. took it off my Fire until they fix this. Cant wait!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I paid the 2.99 to get only 2 levels.  is this a joke?  the free version has more levels than this one (android phone).  Rovio you disappoint me and my family.  please update asap.
B000V6ADNW|5.0|Ten years later and all the songs sound fresh. No social awareness or any substance other than good songwriting and great production. CLASSIC gangsta rap, top five of all time in that category.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game! Great graphics, sound and amusing characters. Option to patiently accumulate coins and acorns to accomplish goals (coins are easy... acorns take awhile), or purchase them in-app to advance quickly.<br /><br />To those still rating 1-star because they don't know how to exit the game... really!? It's NOT difficult to figure out on your own... or read the hundreds of reviews giving explicit instructions!
6302212529|5.0|Good quality and purchased as a gift.  Nice to be able to purchase VHS tapes for those that still have a vcr.  shipping time was also good.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Good little game that works great on my Asus Tablet. Entertaining and a bit addictive. Glad that I downloaded it.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Unfortunately, the author has failed to notify the reader what software this book is designed for. Although, you'll eventually figure out that it's MSWord, there's still no indication of what version of Word that he's using. My 2 versions of Word don't have the same functions that are referenced in this book. What's needed is for the author to go back and include this critical information in the first chapter. Better yet, it should be stated on the book cover! This obvious over-sight has tainted my impression of the book. Since I wasn't able to use it, I certainly can't recommend it. In Fact, if it wasn't free, I'd demand a refund.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nothing about this game that's not to like. Challenging, calming,  beautiful. Nice work- I believe the best game app I've seen on the Kindle Fire.
0671027344|3.0|Have you ever read Catcher in the Rye?  I didn't read it in high school but I read it last year because it came highly recommended by my husband as the best coming of age novel ever.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is this generations (or last generations? It was published in 1999) Catcher in the Rye.  I found the two books pretty similar, although Perks is decidedly more modern.<br /><br />What really struck me was how Charlie changed over the course of the novel.  When the novel started he's moving from middle school to high school and seems very innocent, but as the book continues on it becomes apparent Charlie is willing to drop the innocence... sort of.  He takes LSD, for example, and that's pretty much the opposite of innocent, but at the same time he his letters seem so pure.  He also struggled with his mental illness and by the end of the novel we come to learn what really happened.<br /><br />But there were parts of Charlie I whole-heartedly adored, most notably his ability to stand back, take things in and make great observations about people (hence his being a wallflower).  Charlie seemed pretty realistic, even if he was something an enigma.<br /><br />Ultimately, I give the book three stars.  I liked it, but I didn't fall in love with it because it was so much like Catcher in the Rye.  But I still highly recommend you read it because you should always read a book before you see the movie and Emma Watson is so charming, so you know you're going to want to see it!
B0001VV1GK|1.0|This parking structure broke within the first week we bought it. The elevator is weakly designed and came apart right away. The the top part fall apart. Not recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun puzzle game combined with soothing music make for a rather enjoyable time. Just sit back and enjoy whenever you just want a little something to play, definitely worth getting.
B005GG0MIS|1.0|I would like to buy and read this book, but I will not support a company that has participated in collusive pricing for e-books. I don't mind paying a fair price, expect to pay more for hardcover versions of books I consider \\"keepers,\\" and think this book may be one. But colluding to drive up prices of e-books when there are no production costs is unlawful, as the DOJ has concluded, and disrespectful to those of us who buy a lot of books. I'm sorry for the rating, but the authors chose to publish with S&S. As long as S&S continues its current pricing policy re: e-books, I won't buy anything it publishes. $16.99 for any e-book is outrageous.
B0019GO58C|5.0|This movie was made when I was 12 years old and here I am 40 and I watched it today for the first time and loved it. Great romance. Sometimes you cannot help who you fall in love with, and this movie proves it. Great acting. Just bought my mom who is 64 the dvd today also.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|a really good game. a lil 2 addicting but fun. if u hate ads get the paid version. if you dont mind ads get this version
B005OK81HA|4.0|I saw this and bought it with another CD.  I was interested in this for a fresh recording of some classic rock songs.  I like the idea of a more mature, experienced band recording their older material using the most modern technical equipment available to get the best sound out of it.  This album was good for a few listens and I put it on my ipod.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it will not startle u awake. the volume increases slowly bit u cannot ignore it. get this app! trust me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are good and the score system works well and suprize bonuses are cool. Over all it is a pretty good game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this games is fun for ages. it is easy to level up also. not much money do I put towards this game which is great
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the new levels, fairly easy to beat, yet loads of fun for old and young alike.  Try it!  You'll like it!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|It looks like metal in the picture, but it's really plastic. It has batteries, it's easy to assemble. The light goes on, the light goes off. The pen writes. It's one of those things you open up and say, \\"Cool, the tenth doctor's sonic screwdriver!\\" and ten minutes later, you're done with it, and it's a souvenir. But it's durable, I'll give it that.
B007R41E8O|5.0|No download issues with my Kindle Fixed. I set the device to not go into sleep mode while the game was downloading. This is really important, because the Kindle drops its wi-fi connection when it sleeps.<br /><br />As for the game itself - excellent graphics, good story and a variety of puzzles kept me intrigued until the end. It was a nice, long story, too, and a real bargain at the price. More, please!
0525478817|5.0|Possible spoiler alert! My daughter pre-ordered this book so she could get an autographed copy. John Green autographed the entire first printing! Her first autographed copy had little more than a squiggle in it, and she lost that one, but I was able to get another autographed copy from a bookstore in Chicago, and that had a better autograph. She was hoping for a Hankler fish--a drawing from John's brother Hank, that only appears in a few books. She didn't get that, but she loves the book anyway. It's just a great story about two unusual teenagers who may not be like you, but you like them anyway and empathize strongly with them. I highly recommend this book for teenagers. It might not be suitable for the 9-12 year old set as it deals with emotional issues they may not be ready to deal with (two friends dying of cancer--I hope that wasn't a spoiler for anyone). But it's a wonderful book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|need more $$$ to buy energy fun and addicting game.  Like to play this game to pass the time and unwind at night. lots of things to do in this game.
1576875776|5.0|Beautifil book! Very good prints!<br />The quality of the book is very good and for the price its a very good purchase .
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|was fun until the timers got all messed up...put about 20 hours into it and now cant collect nothing....really really lame
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I bought it primarily because I missed playing Call of Duty on my Xbox 360. I switched over to the PS3 and I immediately missed my Xbox 360 controller. Unfortunately THERE IS A DEAD ZONE with this controller. The dead zone makes COD a complete bitch to play. If you don't want to ruin your KD then don't get this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved all three books and want to read them again. They are so addicting.  Don't be afraid to read them!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I &hearts; this app. you should get it. it is awesome.oh and you don't need wi fi to play, only to show some ads. and also to download it too. &#9834;&#9834;&#9834;
0545265355|5.0|First, if you are thinking about getting this book over any other one, get these. Very good story plot and is a movie now. Number one at the box office for five weeks straight. Also if you buy this set it comes in a collectors box which is very nice for head over heels fans. The books arent super long but arent easy reads. They have some violence but still good for all ages. I loved these books more than any book ive ever read. I love the hunger games. GET THE BOOKS! Price wise they are a good buy because to get the whole set in hardcover are 30 to 50 dollars so for the minimum of 30 they are good.<br />LOVE THEM AND SO SHOULD YOU!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun and educational.  My kids and I both love it and fight to have a turn.  Wish you were allowed more energy per playing time.

B004UID2LC|1.0|worst youtube app ever. oh and u cant even sign in to ur youtube acount. what a useless app to even make. it sucks. crap. blows. horrible. waste of space, money and time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great way to waste time! Tip for Rezound users: make sure to enter your name and start the game or it won't open again until you clear app data. Didn't try stock GB, but works perfect on ICS leak.
B002WLTI62|5.0|Amazing vocals, in English and Spanish, Great dance music!<br />These are some of my favorite dance tracks of all time. Its a must for dancers and people who love Good music!

B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved the book as much as The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. It's sometimes a little difficult to follow the names and places because they are in Sweeden and not in USA. But other than that I liked both and am ready to start The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is amazing but I think you could let the samurai attack at your command I think that would be.better
B004I744AS|5.0|I absolutely love all of the features of this app: dictionary, thesaurus, even.trivia and word games.  Probably the best app I've ever downloaded.  and for Free!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is an awesome CD/DVD combo,anyone that likes Adele will love this. You can't go wrong with this purchase.Great gift idea!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is an awesome game. I can not stop playing it. I absolutely love it. It is neat to continue the story of the Oregon trail
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have connected the game to my Facebook and everything. I have not encountered any problems as of yet. I have seen some people complain that they can't exit the game. not true. just hit the &quot;stuff&quot; button on the bottom right and you will be able to find your way out from in there. (even my kids and husband want to play this game)
1613822014|5.0|I read this book in 1997 for the first time. Ever since then, I keep this book next to me and read it everytime I have a major decision to make or there is a something that bothers me. This book gives me great guidance for meditation.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever it is fun and addictive.Now I kno some of u don't kno how to get back to ur home screen.

Now that I showed u how to get back to the home screen please change ur review
0446547603|2.0|I purchased Safe Haven on the back of so many positive reviews. I found it very underwhelming and oh so predictible.  I only finished it because other reviews promised a fantastic twist at the end. I love to bring away a warm fuzzy feeling after committing to a book but all I took away this time was frustration for wasting 8 hours of my life and $9.......
B006GH6IS4|5.0|I have watched the original 2 part 2 hour documentary and was thrilled.  I knew a ton of Queen facts, but after watching was even more informed, especially their early to mid 80's period.  Then I watched the additional stories and interviews in the bonus section of the Blu-Ray.  Worth the price of admission right there...why was this not included in the original documentary????  Almost 2 more hours of insight, knowledge, stories, alot of live video tracks, facts, etc. etc.  So in all nearly a 4 hour documentary on Queen.  Throw in 7 bonus videos for good measure, and this is worth every penny and repeated viewings!
0545265355|5.0|I once read a book about hunger,<br />  T'was a very good story 'bout games,<br />It showed that a bad, replaced by a foul, is no more than a changing of names.<br /><br />I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Owl
B005SZAEYO|5.0|I love the Horror genre, and it is difficult to find a good show like American Horror Story. The reviews seemed to be mixed, so I didn't have high expectations going in, but it is one of my new favorites.  It is both grotesque and beautiful, and will definitely horrify you, and possibly cause some nightmares.<br /><br />The characters are well-written, but few of them are really likeable.  They are mostly ghosts that have died and become trapped in the house, most of them murdered.  There are humans, which are the main characters, but I found the dead ones to be much more complex and interesting.  The show blurs the lines of good and evil, as well as living and dead.  It is difficult to tell whether some characters are good, evil, or even alive.  Figuring out the puzzle is a nice part of the show.<br /><br />It has a lot of twists and turns, and I can honestly say it is one of the first times I have been genuinely surprised by a plot twist in a series.  The end leaves you wondering how the show can even go on to another season, and eagerly anticipating the next season.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Acquired this app for my Android tablet from Amazon. It' very handy & has been quite accurate, also works great; no problems. Living in a rural tornado land, I can access the radar on my tablet with this app unless the power goes out & shuts my wi fi down. So far, that's not happened. Would recommend this app to anyone. Thank you, Amazon for providing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I first heard of this because of the HBO series, I know, for shame.  But since then I am determined to read all the books.  I will say, it is a bit of a tough read and I am slightly thankful that I watched the entire first season before diving in, mostly because it's a lot easier to put names to faces, and quite frankly there are an abundance of characters.  I love this book, love the series and will definately be reading/watching all of them.
B00466HN6S|5.0|This was a great movie for my 4-year old granddaughter as well as her 11-year old brother, her parents and grandparents.  Recommend highly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app so much more than the Weather Channel.  Use it on the KF and have not had any issues.  Easy to use and like the graphics.
1416955070|4.0|I know what you're thinking... long, long time no blog, right? We'll it's been one of those work weeks where I work a 9 hour day at work, come home eat and sleep. I have to say I'm a little stressed. But I decided to sit down and read City of Bones again. It's been a month of re-reads for me. I've used the books that I've read over and over again almost like I use mashed potatoes as my comfort food. So, without further adieu, here is my review for City of Bones!<br /><br />The story begins with the young Clary Fray as she and her friend, Simon, dance the night away at Clary's favorite club, Pandemonium. The people there are always strange looking with their neon hair, crazy piercings and outrageous clothing. Clary notices a boy being followed by a beautiful young girl and two young men, and she can feel that something awful is about to happen. She follows them into a storage closet where the stalkers proceed to stab the young man and kill him. What is most astonishing about this is not that the boy is stabbed, but that he vanishes after being killed. It is at this moment, that Clary's life changes forever. Clary learns of a world that she never knew existed, right under her nose. She's introduced to the Shadowhunters or Nephilim, whose purpose in life is to rid the world of demons. Sucked into the world of the Shadowhunters Clary must enlist their help to save her mother and try to defeat the most evil Shadowhunter of all time.<br /><br />This book is so amazing. Cassandra Clare really does have a super power in the form of writing awesome books. I'm a huge fan of her Mortal Instruments series as well as her Infernal Devises books as well. City of Bones is such a strong kick off to the Mortal Instrument series. We are introduced to all of the characters and their back stories as this is a very character driven novel. Books with a heavy emphasis on characters tend to bore me as there are too many long stories about past experiences to build up their backgrounds, but with this book, I was itching for every single piece of information I cold get about the characters.<br /><br />Of course their is a romance in the book and this one is a sort of tragedy alongside the likes of Romeo and Juliet. Clary and Jace are such a dynamic couple. It is in them that we see Clare's gift of ever frustrating her readers to the point of throwing the book across the room and then begrudgingly hopping out of bed to go grab it to see what happens next.  How does she frustrate me to the point of almost tears and still make me crave for more? We may never know. It's the charm of Cassandra Clare's writing and I have to say, that I'm a very happy, yet frustrated reader.<br /><br />If you haven't read this series yet, I strongly suggest that you get started. These books are such a treasure to read and Clare is throwing a lot at us in a very short time. The next book in the series, City of Lost Souls comes out this May. Her next installment of the Infernal Devices, Clockwork Princess, is set to be released in early 2013. This series is a sort of prequel to the Mortal Instruments series. She's staring a brand new Shadowhunter series called the Dark Artifices and book one is going to be called Lady Midnight and will be coming out in 2015. And lastly, and probably most importantly, filming begins this August for the City of Bones movie! Ahhh!<br /><br />9 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading<br /><br />-Allison<br /><br />This review brought to you by imabibliophobic.blogspot.comwith this book, I was itching for every single piece of information I cold get about the characters.<br /><br />Of course their is a romance in the book and this one is a sort of tragedy alongside the likes of Romeo and Juliet.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love it it is solo cool I played it on genesis's ipad and it was so stinking cool gjfhhgjtyhf fbvfhbt fhnvj I'm so bored can u tell
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun and super addictive!! Great app!! As long as you know that it's going to have ads, and you have to unlock games by playing, it's great!!!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Bought this for my son's birthday having just seen it online.  He loves it and what a great occupier for long trips.  Screen is the size of a laptop screen and very clear.  Great find!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was very well written,quick read.  Somewhat disturbing subject, I do not think this is a children's book.  Would recommend for mature readers.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Game plays smoothly on my Kindle Fiire. I purchased game, it downloaded, and I then selected it to begin play. Unfortunately I did incounter the extremely long loading of the game, which took like 5 minutes or at least it felt that long. Instead of sitting there watching it load, I just hit the back arrow(on Kindle Fire) and busied myself checking back periodically to see if the game finished loading. FYI Once it does the initial load all other times you go to play the game it loads very quickly. Other then that, the game is amazing. I love the flow, the hidden object games, and the mini games. It is A LOT of fun. I never leave reviews and I was so impressed by this game, and its extremely low price considering what you get, that I just had to let others know that it is worth every minute it takes to load the game for the first time. I hope others enjoy this game as much as I am.
B006PZBR8S|1.0|I was just getting into this movie when it paused and reloaded in SD with only one dot. It was very fuzzy. I went to another channel and watched something else for a while. But the HD was still out an hour later. I'm going to try again tonight.<br /><br />I don't think it was my connection. I got HD quality on Netflix streaming. I have a nine foot (110\\") screen. HD works for me.<br /><br />Amazon HD streaming is charged at the highest rates. I typically rent one or two movies from Amazon each month. I'm rethinking that.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's got nice graphics, cute characters from the films, mini games mixed with building your village, short films, currency is earnable to you without spending actual cash, nice touch response, all around balanced game. Hard to believe they put this much work into this game featuring such a popular film series and it's FREE. You can purchase in game items with cash but it's simple to adjust settings so kids cannot spend actual cash without parental permission. Fun for all ages.
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|Bonnie Raitt has proven time and again over the past 4 decades that she is a consummate musician and rock and blues vocal interpreter. I'm glad to announce that she shows us AGAIN just how good it feels to be in her musical world.  Whether she's rocking out on 'Split Decision', rolling in the blues of 'Million Miles', playing with a calypso version of 'Right Down the Line', or just singing the HECK out of one of the heartbreaking ballads this CD contains, Ms. Raitt proves she has lost NONE of her gutsy, glorious style and vocal ability!
B001EPYQO6|5.0|Great movie and they added never seen before footage.  Still wish that the outcome would have been different.  Nice epic battle scenes.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice little droplet of water, I will try to protect you.  This is a fun app for adults and kids, especially my cute little 7 year old boy.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This book is a classic.  Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion.  The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable.  It was an important part of his life.  Also, the price was right: free.
B004EPYZUS|2.0|This is the worst of the MI series. Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and hope he is in any future movies. Ving and Michelle only appear in the last few minutes of the movie and seemed to be thrown in for die hard fans of the series. Do not waste your money, watch it on Netflix if you have it.
0743526937|3.0|Interesting book and it does have some valid doctrine and techniques based on the authors' years of experience.  This is one of many recent editions.  The only drawback is that there needs to be more examples, recent examples, of where it worked and did not work.  It is still a book to read or listen to on CD.
1401227821|5.0|It was worth every penny.  I read it from cover to cover...twice.  The artwork was gorgeous...his run on Wonder Woman breathtaking.  His work is not only beautiful, but funny and intelligent as well.  His pencil sketches are detailed and enlightening and show an artist that is meticulous and hardworking.  What a joy it must be to be his editor and to be the first one to open these works of art on a computer.<br /><br />The text is fun to read and feels like a good friend is sitting next to you showing his portfolio... self-effacing about what is obviously extremely talented work.<br /><br />The only thing that bugs me is that I wished he had expanded on techniques.  He would briefly discuss some of the digital techniques he discovered while working....which only tantalized us fellow artists that work in a digital environment. Maybe he will publish a book on Photoshop painting techniques...we can only hope.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|Iggy & the Stooges - Raw Power (1973)<br /><br />Disk 1:<br /><br />...finds RAW POWER remastered and generally faithful to the David Bowie mix, the one which was (bafflingly) chosen for the original release. It's been polished up and smoothed over a bit, in particular the left-right channel extremities that existed on the original vinyl have been evened out so that some sound is heard in both channels. It's not quite as harsh and radical sounding as it used to be but no one will mistake it for anything other than Bowie's version. The bottom end rumbles like a bull, but on this mix it's a neutered bull, distant and crammed into a corner. It's truly a testament to the hair-splitting ferociousness of this raw music that it prevailed and still prevails over such a radical mix.<br /><br />I don't like the Bowie mix much at all. While I'm all for studio experimentation and using the studio as an instrument, I don't think what Bowie did is all that impressive. It only drains the music of its power instead of enhancing it. It's raw alright. Raw as in undercooked.<br /><br />Despite its faults, the Iggy mix released in '97 is the one I always reach for now. So it's too \\"hot,\\" too compressed, etc. but damn if it doesn't sound like the ass-kicking rock n' roll mix this album always deserved, or at least the closest thing to it I've heard so far. There's a lot of interesting sounds that were brought up in that mix such as the celeste on \\"Penetration.\\" That instrument barely makes an appearance on this version; it's not even really noticeable until a few stray notes at the end. I would say the Bowie mix suffers from its absence (I think the instrument adds an interesting exotic flavor) but it's got it's own thing going for it that many listeners might actually prefer. It's fair to say that each song on Disk 1 sounds radically different from its twin version on the Iggy mix. Personally, I don't think there's much point in arguing about how good the remastering job is on this latest version. It's the Bowie mix so I just won't be listening to it much.<br /><br />But I think any version you can get your hands on is worth spinning. If you're a fan it's just great fun to figure out for yourself which version is your favorite or to decide what you love (or hate) about each mix. The ROUGH POWER bootlegs of Iggy's original mixes released in 1993 are interesting too but clearly in need of work. Maybe the day will come when anyone will be able to easily remix the album on their own computer...although these recordings have proven themselves to be wild and hard to tame. Maybe the perfect mix is impossible to create. Or maybe no one who really knows what they're doing has gotten a crack at it...in the liner notes of the '97 release, Iggy relates his first attempt at remixing RAW POWER. He put everything in the red and all the instruments were blaring and bleeding everywhere. He loved it but can you imagine how hard the audiophiles would've freaked if his record company had released that one?? lol I can only imagine...the fact is, there are only three tracks to work with - the rhythm section, the lead guitar and the vocals so options are pretty limited anyway. Still, I don't know why the record company never got a real professional to mix this album. Crazy.<br /><br />I understand the complaints people have concerning the \\"loudness wars\\"....and while I hate the thought of clipping or a compressed dynamic range, I understand why this is done, especially with so many people using ear buds and computer speakers. You can hear a lot more of the subtle background sounds that are sometimes too quiet to hear on traditional mixes, particularly if one is accustomed to listening at low volumes. Sometimes surprising and wonderful things are revealed; that's something you rarely hear mentioned by audiophiles who complain about the way records are made these days. I'm not defending the practice; in fact, I hate it. But I'm no audiophile (can't afford it!) and again,this latest version is in essence the Bowie mix cleaned up and therefore nothing else about it really matters to me because I'll still be listening to Iggy's mix. Besides, this music is brute force, hardly the kind of thing most listeners would get their panties in a twist over. Not nit-picky mastering details. It makes me think about how absurd it would be to see skate punks at a skate park blaring a Flipper tape out of some crappy boom box and debating the finer points of its high-end resolution. But I do like having a copy of Bowie's mix. That's how it was originally released and that's history. And if you turn it up loud enough the low end rumbles hard while the guitar shreds your skull.<br /><br />Disk 2:<br /><br />This particular concert is known for the \\"10 Georgia Peaches\\" bit (which appears after \\"Search and Destroy\\"), a seemingly improvised (and successful) bit of poetry performed in honor of the southern State they rocked that night. To my ears this bootleg recording sounds great, probably as good as one could hope for considering the source material. It smolders with crackling intensity, especially from the distorted guitar amps. I don't think Ig has ever delivered a halfhearted performance, so you can be sure he's worth listening to here. It's funny to hear the southern chick who keeps yelling, \\"Iggy I want your body!\\" At one point Mr. Pop unsuccessfully picks a fight with an audience member who was apparently too chicken to take the bait despite much taunting. I don't blame him though, Iggy sounds pretty intimidating! One audience member can be heard saying, \\"I don't think he likes us!\\" Whether it's drug-induced or just an act, he definitely sounds like a crazy man. I think it can be said that, above everything else, Iggy was (and still is) a superb showman, some might even say a highly professional one. I think this recording is proof.<br /><br />Appended after the concert is \\"Doojiman,\\" a RAW POWER outtake with splattering guitar in which Iggy flips out like a monkey on acid. Way cool. There's also, inexplicably, a rehearsal performance of \\"Head On,\\" one of the tracks from the \\"great lost Stooges album.\\"<br /><br />Although I much prefer the '97 Iggy mix (a must have), it's cool having a copy that reflects the way this classic album sounded when it was first released.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game! mindless fun. works on my Droid well. only thing that I don't like is the WiFi download.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really fun game. Good controls and challenging levels. Perfect for all Mario lovers, if you love platform games than this is the game for you.
0345803485|4.0|This would by my very first review of any book and I am a reader.<br />James pulls you into the characters without a doubt; however I find myself turning to others who are reading it currently or will be soon and asking.... \\"Am I the only one who is jealous by her over the top mulitple orgasms?\\"<br />Loved all 3 book, read them all in less than a week; however my favorite is the end of book 3, Christian's story.<br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, but I did some polling of my girl friends and found I am not the only one who felt the over the top orgasms were far fetched.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I heard about this book in one of the romance forums.  It was highly recommended.  It was compared to 50 Shades.  I decided to give it a go.  Really I think I like it alot more than 50 shades.  Both the H and h are dealing with issues from their past.  It is an intense read without a big cliff hanger.  Most questions were answered in this book,except for the H's past. Can't wait for the next book in this series.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Fast delivery, well packaged.  Love this series!  I'm going to miss Andy Whitfield.  This was a great series.  Even the prequal was good.
B005COO1X6|2.0|It started out as an interesting idea, but really bombed at the end! Stephen King is one of my favorite authors.  However, Mile 81 was a disappointment.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|While not a bad book by any means, the further I read into this book and its sequel, the more disappointed I became. What starts out a political drama slowly includes more and more bits of magic. I've read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. I've nothing against the inclusion of magic in fictional worlds. It just feels out of place in part because none of the characters early on appear to have any acquaintance or belief in it. Magic just seems to appear, as if from nowhere. And, when its used, it seems un-necessarily grotesque and, well, overly convenient.<br /><br />The whole series of seven books feels much longer than it needs, and some of the plot makes me wonder if the author made decisions while playing a long and bizarre D&D campaign.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I will admit this game is quite addictive. I really enjoy playing it. Recently however there have been too many glitches. I can plant an hour crop and when I come back to check on it I somehow now have 157 hours remaining.  Things of this sort have been going on for several weeks. Although the actual game is nice I simply have run out of patience waiting for a fix.

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I bought this series and watched the entire first season in less than a week. The story keeps you watching for what's going to happen next and you'll notice famous prohibition era gangsters throughout the series. the extra features are cool to if you enjoy history.
B0015346OM|3.0|An interesting book given the contemp[orary nature of the incident. A bit too much detail of the action and not enough of the background to the conflict. Sections from the Somali participants were insightful.
B004SRNH10|4.0|I needed this app in order for some of the game apps to work properly on my son's tablet. The games downloaded but wouldn't work. I downloaded this app and afterwards all the other apps worked perfectly.
1601251505|5.0|I have researched a lot of RP games in the last few years.  Very, very impressed at what I have seen here so far.  I played my frist couple of games in college with 3.5 (with a side game of cathulu) and after I bought D&D 4th ed. and played for about a year I became more and more disappointed).  Pathfinder is a very smart re-creation of 3.5 and serious players should definately pick it up.  You can also get the pdf version for $10 I hear.  Also you should be aware of [ASIN:1932867023 D6 Fantasy] if you have not seen West End Games' old stuff.  If you like flexibility and ease of play, ressurect D6.  I see you can get copies right now for $5.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I'm really excited to find these types of games for my son for free. He loves these types of games and we have fun sitting together and trying to figure out the mysteries. This one looked like it would be a good one...I downloaded and it showed up on my device, however, when I touch the app icon, it would always say the app was not installed. I tried several times to uninstall and reinstall but couldn't get it to work.

B006XIR9KM|5.0|Everyone should bump up their star rating by 1 in order to offset the thoughtless 1 star always posted by trolls like stupidman.<br /><br />Many people first look at the star rating.

1433502410|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of the ESV Study Bible.  Research had indicated that this is one of the most accurate translations of the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts.  I purchased this to use as I go through the Disciple Bible Study at my church and have found it very helpful.  The paper used seems to be of high quality and the print is very clear.  The helps and maps are top notch.<br /><br />One of the best features bundled with purchase of this Bible is access to the online version of it at no extra charge.  Sometimes at the end of the day it is easier to read on the computer screen where I can enlarge the font size if I wish.<br /><br />I ordered this around 3:00 in the afternoon and was pleasantly surprised to see it had shipped within an hour from a facility in Kansas and was delivered to me the very next afternoon.  It's hard to beat service like that!<br /><br />I have no qualms about recommending the ESV Study Bible to anyone wanting to study God's Word.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|If there is one thing Al Gore is passionate about, it's the environment.  His book \\"Earth in the Balance\\" and now this documentary are proof of his environmental concerns.  I enjoyed watching this, six years after this documentary was released, and would give this five stars if it weren't for the underlying political tone of this work:  bitter about losing the presidential election in 2000, Gore devotes his time to further support his data on global warming.  This alone would be fine, but the dabs against his successor, George W Bush, are for a bit annoying.  And I am no fan of GWB.<br /><br />This documentary feels like a small lecture on Global Warming.  Gore is on stage in front of impressive graphics or film clips that come across the screen.  His delivery is more animated than any press conference he gave as VP.  He uses layman's terms to get his point across.  The audience sits back and occassionally gasps in disbelief.<br /><br />Gore covers many topics that all cause the earth's climate to change.  The increase in carbon dioxide is one of them, but the increase in CO2 also causes ocean temperatures to rise, atmospheric winds to increase, and precipitation to alter its presence.  Evidence of more deadly floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters such as drought and extreme temperature ranges in the first 12 years of this century alone should be alarm enough.<br /><br />Gore's disappointment in the US never signing the Kyoto Agreement is very evident.  But was is more shocking, taking the data in this document and the increase in more deadly storms and floods across the globe (and more powerful weather satellites and computers), is the INCREASE in former Kyoto Treaty signatories refusing to extend the treaty.  Russia, France, Canada have now bowed out, in protest against China and India not being signatories, either.  China and India's population are both increasing every year, and China's rapid industrial growth pushes it to the world's #2 polluter of atmospheric pollutants.<br /><br />The fear of global warming has morphed into climate change since this documentary was released.  China has become more economically powerful.  Still, this is a very powerful message to convey and a documentary that can still bring out debate among viewers of differing political groups.  Just watch this knowing it's been six years since its initial release.  Makes me wonder if Gore would change anything about this documentary if this were re-released for 2012.uter of atmospheric pollutants.<br /><br />The fear of global warming has morphed into climate change since this documentary was released.

B006QPVH6O|1.0|The movie is not a 'found footage' movie, although it makes the attempt to be so. While it is interesting that we have never returned to the moon, fictional films like this actually aide the powers that be in any possible cover up of truth. Controversy sells. Dont waste your money. Rent 'The Fourth Kind' instead.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Got the video in record time. Couldn't wait to sit down and watch it. Kicked back and had memories of me cruzing around in my 1972 Silver Cutlass coupe with Black Vinyl top, wide tires, side pipes, a thumping cam, and listening to my Styx 8-track. Those were the days my friend!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Knowning this was the final book of the series could bring you to tears, just for that reason. But this book and previous books are filled with so much emotion that you become so involved with the lives of those individuals in the book(s) your enjoyment will lead you to read the series again.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I already love Sophie Kinsella, and I thought this was her writing at it's best. Loved the fact the main character had some brains (which sometimes get at me with the shopaholic series) and has her usual witty writing style. Recommended.

B007HJ84ZK|5.0|I read the books, now am watching the series.  The series stays very true to the books and I am enjoying watching the story unfold all over again for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's always disappointing when the movie doesn't live up to the book. The book gives so much more to the knowledge of what our future could be. The author put so much into this, that you feel like your living right in the book. Enjoyed every page and couldn't wait to move on to the next book in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|When I bought this game I thought maybe it whole be boring but once I started playing I got hooked. I highly recommend this game.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Just watched Hachi: A Dog's Tale (US version) again... cried for half the movie... my father also passed away when I was younger and also had a dog... a Chow Chow. Recently, we had to let go of our Chow and put him to sleep. I was with him till the last moment and I will never forget the gift he gave to both my parents and I.  I look at Hachi and when I look at his eyes in the screen, I see our beloved Oreo.<br /><br />It's a must see and don't forget the tissues, as 99% of you will probably cry.

630264366X|4.0|quite dramatic reconstruction of events in rome 1943<br />however the way nazism is portrayed as the only evil in history<br />is quite inaccurate<br />two million jews were crucified by the romans in ad70<br />the catholic church was guilty of the insquision<br />and st bartholews massacre<br />anyway i suppose as the film was made in rome and using vatican<br />premises the producers had to be careful not to offend
0439023521|4.0|Like everyone else I think the book was paced perfectly and well written.<br /><br />Now I realize that these books were geared to teens, but I had problems with that part of the writing. Which was greatly disappointing because I do love the book. I thought she described the area and situations in a way that was easy to picture. I didn't like the way she described the main characters though. Maybe I'm used to my authors having a better idea of who they are writing about, but I had a lot of trouble picturing a lot of the characters and kept thinking of the movie characters. This could have been a writing ploy so that it is easier for teens to put themselves and their friends into these characters, but is was still disappointing to me.<br /><br />The other thing I found very annoying was the actual battle scenes. While the last one is pretty graphic, the rest i found a little stale. Again, probably because this was written for teens. I'm a big horror fan, so to me it wasn't \\"brutal\\" as a lot of the reviewers are saying.<br /><br /> Now the context and subject matter are quite brutal. I cried a few times while reading, her story telling is wonderful.

There are several monsters in this book to create. There are short write ups on each one (older kids will understand the references made. Looking forward to having them all complete and my son knows that they are delicate and more of a shelf item or light play sculpture - but not to be thrown into the toy box. Just a very cool activity to sit and do. The glue I'm using is Tacky glue and it's pretty fast drying - which is what you want when you have a whole bunch of tabs to glue. 5 thumbs up! HA!

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|so many reviews have been written pointing out the pro and cons of this film so all I want to do is share a couple of scenes I really enjoyed.<br /><br />The Help Each Other scene.  This was about as moving and nostalgic of a sequence in all of cinema as there ever will be.  The camera work in this scene reminded me of a ballet.  And the intimate and playful communion of the Mother and three children was sublime as they race around the house and backyard.  Very spiritual indeed.  \\"Help each other.  Love everyone.  Every leaf, every ray of light.  Forgive,\\" whispers the Mother in poetic voice over as Angela Hewitt's recording of a Couperin piece is played in the background.<br /><br />I also like the symbolism in the 'resurrection' sequence at the end.  Notice how there is a bride all decked in a wedding gown lying on a sort of deathbed and then suddenly she is standing shimmering in light in light as the wonderful camera flashes by her.  This reminded me of the Revelation of Jesus Christ (the last book of the Bible):<br /><br />{21:2} And I, John, saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.<br />. . .<br />{21:9} And one of the seven Angels, those holding the bowls filled with the seven last afflictions, approached and spoke with me, saying: \\"Come, and I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\\"<br /><br />Also someone else pointed out the reference in Revelation to the sea emptying its dead.  This is clear in the gathering of the families in the midst of the shallow sea.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that in the 'resurrection' sequence the mother (Chastain) with the lovely green dress (green the symbol of life) suddenly turns her head and views the sun before the sky is darker. She moves her head and looks thoughtful as if she is being summoned in her heart and mind.  This is exactly what I think Malick intended.  The sun is clearly in the context of the whole movie a symbol for God who summons her at that moment.  Then a quick underwater shot is shown of her floating up to the surface (similar to the birth scene earlier in the movie).  This is a symbol for her spiritual rebirth.  Then her dress color changes to the light blue and of course she leaves in the procession from the house in a spectacular and memorable fashion.  An exultant crystalline walk toward the sun with arms raised in praise! Then she is as if assumed into the figurative sun and offers her own son who died young thus resolving her search established in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Then of course there are the unspeakably lovely childhood sequences with Holst's hymn to Dionysius.  Very affectionate.  Very good and humane all around.<br /><br />When I was in the theater an older gentlemen was literally exalted at the last shot.  He shouted, \\"That was very good!\\" and began clapping.  Powerful, profound, humane, good, even very Christian.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the package you even get a digital copy which can be given to poor college students who own laptops :)  I gave mine to a young college student who I know from the coffee shop.  He said the movie truly changed his life.<br /><br />All is good and fine when one thoughtfully views this movie.  God bless!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have read a lot of biography's over the years, this one is tops.  Even though it wasn't written by Jobs', I feel as though it is an accurate portrayal of this highly driven, successful but also flawed man.  I think it was done fairly.  I would recommend it to anyone that like's to read about the successes and the mistakes of one man on his life journey.  Thanks Steve for your contribution to society.  May your legacy be one of truth and honor.

I cant wait to get further into all the games its gonna take a while but at least the games are fun and if you don't win the first time they keep yo interested so you will go back and keep playing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome!!!! this game truly is addicting. if you want something to play no matter when this is it.team sloth!!! lol
B006XIR9KM|5.0|A great little game. If you like puzzles and memory games you'll love it. Stable. Good intuitive controls. Good navigation. A fun way to pass a few minutes. Probably not for you if you like high intensity shooter games with blood and gore.
0812992792|5.0|A very engaging book. I love it when a book makes me think about it for the rest of the night.  I put it down, but eagerly sought it out every night, to read a little further into Jun Do's story.  I can't stop thinking about it, or how I wanted the story to end.  Propaganda within propaganda??  Others have written good summaries of the story.  All true.  But it just grabs you and makes you think.  I don't want to think about the trauma in the story, or the nonchalant way in which it is told, but I do.  I sympathized with those, even ones who did bad things.
B0012LAUJ2|5.0|What could you add to a record that has 20minutes songs played by Miles Davis in his full form and shape! I have the complete recordings of this record on CD but the vinyl fullfill the house like none CD would do... If you love jazz you must buy this record but if you love your heart and ear you should have it on vinyl.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game it is very entertaining and you don't have to have Internet to play it is defiently worth downloading.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This is a great game. lots of fun. Looks and sounds great. No crazy permissions. Works great on my r2d2, will try later on the transformer.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I Only wish I could award this movie with a higher rating than a 5 star, Deep down it only reaffirmed my belief that you should never judge a person until you get to know them, This was brilliantly written and directed, this is not 'Titanic' with known actors, I didn't recognize any of the actors in this movie and neither will you but that is a good thing here, they all did a great job of getting the job done. I don't normally write reviews of movies, but for a low budget film, it doesn't in my opinion get any better then this....a great 'original', as this side of the story is not going to be what you think, has so many twists and turns, it's a great movie! As some one else said, invite some friends over, have some beer and whatnot, and enjoy this movie, I will definitely watch this again later. 10 stars out of 5 if that was possible!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are mostly lame but the progressive revelation makes the app addicting and can keep a goal orientated person occupied for months
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a lot of fun. I really enjoy games that I can play a little each day.  the virtual city games are awesome!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|super fun and addicting to play. great for kids of all ages. cute characters really come to life. get it and start having some cool ice age fun.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is brilliant! I downloaded it on my kindle fire and it works perfectly. You can download any video from youtube for free!! It's great on kindle fire but I believe it may not work so well on other android devices. Still love it though!!!!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. It is very addicting and hours will fly by before you know it. Beat the game twice and almost finished with all the achievements. It's that good.
0060989157|5.0|You don't have to be a fan of the Crue to appreciate this book.  Not only do all five members(if you include John Corabi) share their experiences, but persons involved with them such as former manager Doc McGhee, A&R rep Tom Zutaut, and manager Doug Thaler make intriguing contributions to the overall story of what it was like dealing the monster that was Motley Crue.<br /><br />You can open this book to any page and dive right into an intriguing story.  Highlights of each member to me is when Nikki got sober for the first time in his life, and didn't know what to do with himself.  Mick shares his solitude state, and how the band cracked on him when he started dating Emi, a backup singer from the GGG tour.  Vince is someone I never particularly liked then, but even at that you can't help but be empathetic to how deeply he shares his emotions when he lost his young daughter to cancer.  You wish this on no other human being.  Tommy offers the most mercuial stories but he's the guy in this band you wished you could be sometimes.<br /><br />I personally felt that the self-titled record is above and beyond the Crue's most musically intellegent production, and everyone involved shared the same feeling.  And when the record badly floundered, we see how badly Tommy and Nikki had their heads in the clouds about it.  It's a trainwreck that showed how flawed they were as humans.<br /><br />I've read this book dozens of times and I never get sick of it.  Neither will you.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|College students studying a unit on autism pointed me toward this movie.  Dr. Grandin has much to teach, not only about living with autism, but about the value of family, the role of a committed mentor, and the increasingly rare value of courage.  Viewers from all walks of life can learn much from \\"Temple Grandin.\\"
0142000671|5.0|I bought \\"Of Mice and Men\\" for my lit class. I haven't read it yet, but it looks brand new, and I'm very pleased with the book's quality. Great product, great service, and I've heard that it's a good story!! Looks like I'll have to see for myself!
006197806X|3.0|First, let me say that I did enjoy the story!  The idea was original and it kept my attention through the book!  HOWEVER, what really annoyed me was the authors use of constant swearing!  Her favorite word seemed to be SH.T!  I found that this really took away from the overall story with the repetitive use of the word.  I mean come on...we live in a time where we have so many words and other ways to phrase things.  I just wish that she would have used a thesaurus and found some other words that really edified the story.  So, for that reason, I cannot give it 5 stars!
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This is a fun game to play and it can be challenging. I like that there are quite a few symbols and the pieces also can move around. The \\"Combo\\" voice is a nice touch! The game features 4 different games modes and I like the basic mode the best where I can try to beat my old best and fastest score. You can beat your time to finish or reduce the number of moves to win. The survival mode is also fun and will give you bonuses for fast combinations with no errors.<br /><br />The graphics are fairly good and overall it is a simple design game and well designed. I like the fact that they removed the permissions from the game and I hope they keep them out.<br /><br />This game is fun and can be a time killer while enjoying yourself. I think you will like the game!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I grew up with the Muppet Babies Cartoon and the Muppet movies and became a fan of the oldie but goodie Muppet Show when I got older. When they announced this movie was coming out I was all but screaming for joy. I saw it in the theater with my family and was taken back to my childhood, it having the same heart as all that has come before it. I would have seen it a second time in theaters if I had been given the chance. I pre-ordered the blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy the moment I had the chance. I love rewatching it in my home, catching many of the things I didn't during my first viewing. The whole thing is charming and puts you in the good mood that you need after a bad day and a hopeful one for the next. The bonus features were also incredibly enjoyable, I particularly liked the bloopers and the behind the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who have ever loved the Muppets or want to introduce a new generation to the Rainbow Connection, though the original Muppet movies are also a must see for new fans too!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I've been using these head phones for over two years now and I couldn't like them much more than I do.  Simply stated, they are battery powered headphones for your xbox 360.  If the price wasn't so high, I would recommend everyone to buy these.<br />These headphones are tremendous for certain situations that come to mind.<br />1.  Living in an apartment/dorm room/duplex/etc.  If you are in tight living situations where it makes it difficult to turn up the volume on your TV, these will work great as you can mute your TV and hear all the xbox gaming action, video watching, etc.  Getting noise complaints from neighboring apartments from your gaming?  This will take care of that.<br />2.  Late night playing.  If you play at night when others in your house are sleeping, as I said previously, you can put your TV on mute so no one can hear your game action and lets people sleep in peace.<br />3.  Cheap Surround Sound solution.  A good surround sound system can cost hundreds of dollars, but for a bit less, you get full surround sound without having to buy a receiver, several speakers, and a sub.<br />4.  Parents on your back?  If your have roommates or parents who get on you for playing your games loud, this will allow you play in peace without disturbing anyone else around you.<br />5.  If you are watching TV with explicit language and have small children around, this allows you to shut down the volume and only you can listen.<br /><br />The sound is very good.  It isn't the best I have ever heard, but it is very good.  Several times will playing [[ASIN:B00269QLI8 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]] I was able to hear enemies in multiplayer matches coming up behind me before I generally would have known unless my TV volume was way up.<br /><br />If you plug this in and us an HDMI cable for video/sound, you can get sound in the headphones AND through your TV speakers.  The headset will plug directly into your controller or will plug into the keyboard attachment that you can buy.  The headset takes two AAA batteries to work and the base unit is powered by USB from from the back of the xbox 360.  I use [[ASIN:B000066PGS Energizer Rechargeable AAA Batteries]] to power it so when the headset goes dead, I can pick up where I left off pretty quickly.<br />They work with all models of xbox 360s, however if you are using the original 360 model and the wireless internet adapter, then you would have to use a one of the front USB ports to power the main unit.<br /><br />I only  gave it 4 stars because it was quite pricey when I bought it at $149.99 and I think it is still a bit steep at $119.99 (price at the time of this review).<br /><br />This does do a job and it does it very well.  If the price was more in the $60-$80 range, I would give it 5 stars without a second thought.y.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an iPod stereo adapter in my car that uses the old firewall pinout for power so I need a charge converter to supply power to my iPhone. I own the Griffen charge converter (no longer sold) and have been using it for years. It works well, but it is designed in such a way that it cannot fully connect to the dock port on my iPhone when the case is on. After a while, this can become annoying as the connection will jiggle loose after driving for a while. The other day I figured I would try the CableJive dockStubz. I was hesitant to purchase it because it looked rather large in the pictures. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived because it was actually quite small. I am happy to report that the dockStubz works exactly as advertised. It converts the charge and it securely attaches to my iPhone. I wish I had sprung for this item several years ago. It is definitely the best charge converter on the market.
B000025ZVE|5.0|I normally do not like the genre of \\"heavy metal\\" as I lean more towards happier music or stuff like Tool when I want to hear the harder stuff. Metallica is the exception to this of course. While Ride the Lightning is near classic, this album blows it out of the water in terms of production value and song structure. The distortion used on this album is my favorite of all time. The song \\"Orion\\"  amazes me everytime I hear it. If you are like me and don't usally listen to this genre, get this album and you just might be surprised.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Never before have i had such an amazing reading experience. Martin has a way with characters that is rarely found in anything post-Tolkein.  The depth to which he explored characters like cersei and jamie in this book has no equal. Well done, sir.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this for my kids but now I am addicted! We all enjoy it! Fun to do together or just when you have a couple minutes to kill! Clips and graphics are great; no surprise!
0374275637|5.0|This is a marvellous book. I'd hesitate to go quite so far as Nassim Taleb, author of The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, who is quoted on the dust cover as saying, 'In the same league as The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud'. Well, maybe not quite in that league, but only because this work is the continuation of many strands of thought in psychology rather than an epoch-changing , intellectual bombshell. The ideas in this book are already, however, changing the ways in which all of us think about the way that we think (if that makes sense) and many of those strands of thought (sorry) were in any case started by Kahneman himself with his earlier collaborator, Amos Tversky, who died in 1996. Kahneman writes, selflessly and touchingly, about his fourteen years working with Tversky: `Our collaboration was the focus of our lives, and the work we did together during those years was the best either of us ever did.'  Maybe Taleb is right, and in fifty years' time Kahneman and Tversky will be even more famous than they are now, and people will be asking, `Sigmund Who?' It could happen.<br /><br />There are two kinds of thinking, says Kahneman, slow thinking (like doing hard mental arithmetic) and fast thinking, which happens so quickly that we don't even notice. Slow thinking takes a lot of brain energy. Our pupils dilate, revealing the increased energy that is required for such difficult mental tasks. Because our available mental energy is limited, when we are working on such `slow-thinking' mental tasks, we will be unable to take on other mental tasks and may fail even to perceive apparently obvious things: there is a strict limit to how much attention our brain can deliver at any one time.<br /><br />As a result, we make most of our decisions the easy way, as in, `This seemed to work before, let's try this route again'- what psychologists call `heuristics' and what we tend to call `rules of thumb'. Our brains, not surprisingly, follow the `law of least effort'. If there is a quick route to a solution, we will take it. We hardly even notice that we have taken the quick route: our brains have the capacity to challenge any such `quick' solution but, in general - guess what? - we let it go. The problem, says Kahneman, is that our `quick thinking' is subject to a disturbingly large number of `systematic biases and errors.' Kahneman goes on to investigate an alarming number of these systematic errors and biases, of which only one is the `anchoring' effect: our decisions are affected, for example, by a number of which we have recently been made aware. `If you are asked whether Ghandi was more than 114 year old when he died you will end up with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would if the anchoring question referred to death at 35.' In the same way, your idea of how much you should pay for a house is influenced by the asking price - even if you want to believe that it wasn't.<br /><br />Our decisions can also be 'primed' by what has recently come to our attention. This leads to some relatively obvious effects - we are more likely to vote for legislation in favour of school funding if the polling station is in a school; and some far stranger effects - students exposed to a number of words related to old age walk more slowly  after the exposure than groups exposed to other words. They do not report that they were aware that the words had a common theme (old age) and they are not concious of the change to their behaviour (walking more slowly).<br /><br />'Substitution' causes us to answer an easier question ('How do I feel about this') rather than a harder question (What do I think about this?). 'Availability' causes us to overestimate the effect of more dramatic events, because they are more 'front of mind'.  The list goes on . . .<br /><br />The book offers a wealth of other compelling examples of the ways in which our `fast thinking' is prone to error, all clearly suggested by the results from a number of elegant experiments. If you don't agree with Kahneman's conclusions, devise your own experiments and test the results: this is science, not metaphysics.<br /><br />Thinking Fast and Slow may (perhaps) be less famous than The Wealth of Nations or The Interpretation of Dreams in fifty years' time, but it's a lot more readable than the former and a lot more scientific than the latter. And it will change your life - or at least how you feel about the reliability and robustness of our decision-making.ggested by the results from a number of elegant experiments.

B0012GMWCA|5.0|I love thos album more as time goes by b/c he's overt with the message while stlll so subtle with the beautiful images to paint in your own mind.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|by season three this was a dumb show getting dumber.  they never did have a story, just random events that are unconnected.  in the final season, they just wrapped it all up by attributing it all to \\"god\\" and maybe the characters were experiencing things in the afterlife, rather than in reality.  either way, no story, just random events.  so, i have a copy, email me and ill see you all seasons cheap.  brianweigel at hotmail
0439023513|3.0|Katniss continues to drudge on, as the key theme of the book is still prevalent: Survival.<br /><br />Book 3 is the actual revenge on the Capitol. We gain some new characters that we grow to endear, like Boggs and the Avok amongst District 13's ranks. But what happens to the rest of them confuses me: Gale. Haymitch. Finnick. Prim. Peeta.<br /><br />Additionally, the demise of Snow is somewhat not what I expected it to be. But overall, the series is a great and quick read.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the clarity of the picture and sound quality was awesome. I wish there had been more special features with the blue-ray but i guess it's available in the deluxe book package. This is one of my all time favorite detective thrillers and the alternate endings was spectacularly done.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This thing is good enough.  My only complaint is the lack of a stylus holder. If it had that I would have given it 4 stars
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well made and relaxing.  Puzzles don't make your head explode, and if you want, you can just grab a hint.  Excellent interface.  Good game.
1408215330|4.0|The dictionary is useful, but the DVD do not support Windows 7! On the other hand, the free online account would be an alternative!
B004PGO25O|5.0|People who pretend to be smarter than others in their book review are obviously people we would prefer to never know.  Thats precisely why when an anonymous person claims a book is intellectually wrong I ask myself \\"who are you?\\". The answer is nobody.  But this book by a somebody named Pressfield was an eye opener.  Whether you choose to believe every word or not, the ideas contained within this book have the ability to change your life.  I highly recommend this book.  It taught me how to recognize resistance which helped me to identify things that were truly important and worth doing.  Give it a shot.  It's well worth the money.
B004INNRFK|5.0|This dvd is a fantastic show in Las Vegas.  It keeps you happy and interested! It's for all the family, young and old.  Although there is not any Latino singer in the program, all the show is of high quality.  A must have!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Nice one !!! Some levels are tough to get 3 stars. But it should be like that. I have both this and Rio, I so far like this version. Have not tried Space yet.

0439023491|1.0|One-fourth into the book, Katniss says, \\"I don't like self-righteous people.\\"<br /><br />I COMPLETELY agree. Yet, a self-righteous person narrates the book.<br /><br />The media-frenzy over The Hunger Games trilogy worries me.<br />Books such as Catching Fire should include STRONG moral messages--fighting for something you believe in, camaraderie, not giving up, finding the power within yourself without the use of weapons, characters in danger or in a position of weakness displaying courage and self-sacrifice for the greater good, etc... With a concept like the Hunger Games, moral examples should literally be oozing from this book. Yet, I fought to find them.<br /><br />**BIG SPOILERS**<br /><br />If you can get through the Hemingway-like short, unnecessary sentences, Collins paints Katniss' character as a shallow, egotistical, girl who I have a hard time believing is the heroine of the story. Everyone in the book does anything they can to protect herself and Peeta. Yet, she rewards them with a disrespectful, negative attitude.<br /><br />After Katniss discovers she will return to the Hunger Games, she narrates: \\"I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I'm the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.\\"<br /><br />As Katniss' mother (an expert in her field), tries to heal Gale from the harsh whippings, Katniss yells at her mother, \\"Give it to him! Who are you, anyway, to decide how much pain he can stand!\\"<br /><br />Katniss gets jealous even at the \\"implication that there's something going on between Gale and Madge.\\" She lets us know clearly--\\"I don't like it.\\"<br /><br />The kicker: \\"Hey, Haymitch, if you're not too drunk, we could use a little something for our skin.\\"<br /><br />The jealousy and the rudeness is enough for me to question the direction Collins wants to take her character. The supporting characters stand by and allow this behavior to happen, because the reader is to believe she holds the \\"secret recipe\\" to overturn this totalitarian government.<br /><br />She even goes as far as to let a fight between her and Peeta change her mind on who to keep in the arena.<br /><br />This self-serving, UNDERSERVING, personality comes from a girl who questions everything and acts on nothing, when her makeup and fashion choices aren't considered. She said it best herself:<br />\\"Sometimes it's not good to consider too many scenarios\\"<br /><br />Collins decides to insert pages full of questions and omits pages consisting of the plot.<br /><br />She questions herself and Gale's relationship--<br />\\"I love Gale. But what kind of love does she mean? What do I mean when I say I love Gale? I don't know. I did kiss him last night, in a moment when my emotions were running so high. But I'm sure he doesn't remember it. Does he? I hope not. If he does, everything will just get more complicated and I really can't think about kissing when I've got a rebellion to incite.\\"<br /><br />She even questions the Capitol's reason for going through with the wedding--<br />\\"The wedding. Is he really planning to go through with it? What, in his twisted brain, will that achieve? Is it for the benefit of those in the Capitol? A wedding was promised, a wedding will be given. And then he'll kill us? As a lesson to the districts? I don't know. I can't make sense of it. I toss and turn in bed until I can't stand it anymore. I have to get out of here. At least for a few hours.\\"<br /><br />These worries are present throughout the whole second book. The more I read, the more I wanted to know why Katniss kept questioning the most trivial things instead of focusing on the bigger themes in the book. I saw so many missed opportunities for the characters in the book to act against the Capitol! But Collins did nothing to progress the storyline of the upcoming revolution. She even inserts \\"I hate this imaginary underground city of District 13 and those who sit by, watching us die. They're no better than the Capitol.\\"<br /><br />But neither is she!<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta had a whole day to themselves at the Capitol. What did they do? They sunbathed and ate on the roof. Katniss sees the repeat of the mockingjay on the tv screen as she heals at home and that doesn't even spark her to create a plan. Katniss overhears the rebellion in District 8 on the mayor's TV and just has more worries. The opportunity the training allows to question the victors from the other districts goes unused. In fact, she doesn't even believe there is another world in district 13, saying \\"they're probably mistaken about the footage.\\"<br /><br />The second book did not progress the Hunger Games plot and the twist at the end came out of nowhere. I have no interest in finding out who Katniss chooses between Gale (whose character we hardly know) or Peeta. The only time the readers sees Katniss' usefulness is when she is using the bow and arrow. Books are highly influential. What true messages are young adults (and adults) supposed to learn from this book? What are the take aways? How effective is the message? Stop me now or I'll start asking paragraphs of questions like Katniss.<br /><br />Peeta is one of the only characters who provides an actual message. His most useful weapon being his words.  He fights with an amputated leg and doesn't complain and even talks about starting a revolution.<br />The secondary characters were at times, forgettable, and offered no voice of reason to the main character. Finnick gave me a sliver of hope.<br /><br />Just a few of my issues with this book.r />But neither is she!<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta had a whole day to themselves at the Capitol.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|A friend of mine (who's very Internet savory) introduced me to Splashtop a few months ago and am I happy he did! Remarkable little tool that lets me access my desktop from anywhere! I even used it on a out-of-town trip. It comes in handy when I. want to share a few videos files with my friends. A breeze to set-up and use. Wish I 'd had this application years ago.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app performs wonderfully. I like that you can change the skins, the forecast is fairly accurate, you can also get the weather for different countries and cities. It makes it easy to access because you can store your favorite cities or countries and with one touch get the weather. I love the 7 day weather preview.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book and series. Kindle version was great and cheaper than the paperback. Bought this as a reread and have already purchased catching fire as well.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I enjoyed the game well enough, but I have two major complaints.<br />-It always seems to be running, even when I force close it and set to kill automatically (Atrix).<br />-There are ads on the intro screen, which is annoying for a paid app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game that the whole family loves! the only issue we have is we completed all the games and want more to be added. we were offered trapper and that was the last game we were offered.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game was okay. During the beginning, there wasn't very much room for anything. I've already had to expand twice. Its okay.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|There is no denying that P!nk is among the top acts that can be found out there. She's a top notch singer and her songs are driving and emotional. While Glitter In The Air and So What gained the most attention from this album, I think I Don't Believe You is the most heartbreaking song on it.

B000PY30JE|5.0|This is a fantastic CD just for the music. What makes it interesting is the history, the endnotes, the \\"behind the scenes\\" thoughts of Mr. Keepnews. Baker's life is a tragedy. To hear the frustration at witnessing this first hand made me appreciate the music that much more. If you are a Baker fan and don't have this CD, you are no Baker fan. I am no jazz elitist at all, but this is beautiful music for driving, for Saturday night and again for Sunday morning.

B006TVQTHW|4.0|I bought this case because it was one of the few inexpensive cases that had a USB 3.0 connector on the front panel.  I had separately purchased a new power supply from Best Buy to put into the case, and I ended up having to return the power supply because it wouldn't work in this case.  This case has the power supply located at the bottom of the case rather than the top, and one of the cords on the power supply wouldn't reach to the CPU power connector on the motherboard.  I'm not sure if this was a fault of the case, the power supply, or both.  But in case they didn't work together.  I went out & bought a more expensive power supply with longer cables on it, and this solved the problem.  I also didn't like that the case had a large fan on the top.  I need to put my router, modem, USB hub and other stuff on top of my case and don't want a fan there.  You also notice the noise a lot more when you have a fan on the top of the case blowing upward, so I just disabled the fan.  Cooling seems good, even without the ceiling fan running.  Overall, it's a pretty good case for the price.  And it has the USB 3.0 front panel connector that I wanted.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|I just want everyone to know that I think this movie was terrific. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it in the IMAX theatre. The scenes filmed with IMAX cameras were vivid and incredible. However, that is exactly what this blu-ray and dvd are missing: the IMAX scenes. The film has been cropped to a consistent 2:40:1. The original IMAX version of the film switches between 2:40:1 for most scenes and 1:43:1 for the scenes filmed with IMAX cameras. The IMAX cameras allowed a lot of image to be captured on film and give a wonderful picture. Blu-Ray releases for \\"The Dark Knight,\\" \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\" and \\"Tron: Legacy\\" preserve the film's IMAX scenes by cropping them 1:78:1 (although the IMAX scenes for \\"Tron: Legacy\\" were originally filmed in 1:78:1 so there was no cropping there).<br /><br />We should demand that Paramount Pictures re-release this film with the IMAX scenes unaltered in their original aspect ratio, or at least cropped to a 1:78:1 so you still get the IMAX effect.

0307279189|5.0|I must say that this book had done a world of good for me. I can't imagine anyone reading this and not feeling inspired to get out of the house and run. I get a little puzzled as to why some would accuse the writer of shamelessly endorsing one shoe company while condemning others. I would say that at best, Christopher McDougall had given the Vibram Five Fingers an honourable mention. He did not in any way endorsed their products. All he had suggested was that we explore the benefits of running correctly as nature had us intended from the very beginning.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, I was an overweight, armchair warrior who suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In the last couple of months since I've read Born To Run, I run/jog up to 80Km a week.<br /><br />So has this book changed my lifesyle for the better? I would dare say so.<br /><br />PS: I do jog in Vibram Five Fingers. I love every minute I run in those.

B004UHSB5A|3.0|This game plays fairly well, but has more complex scoring rules than I'm used to. Sometimes I can't even figure out how they got multiples of five out of certain sets.  By far the most frustrating thing is that even when the green glow shows you are about to make a proper move, the tile flies back down to the bottom as if rejected, often up to five times in a single move.  Very tiring on the eyes to squint at the tiny tiles.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A Clash of Kings really is a clash of several kings... Four kings with their bannerman fighting for the control of the 7 kingdoms.<br />But some bannerman are almost as unreliable as the sellswords, turning their cloaks to whomever suits them best.<br />There's a lot of betrayel, backstabbing, spying and sceeming in this book and that's what makes it so great to read. All these twists and turns of some charachters to keep on top of everything and stay ahead, stay alive... brilliant !<br />But it's also a tale of courage and fighting for what you believe to be just, or in case of the sellswords : the one who pays you.<br /><br />In this second book we get to know the main characters even more and I love them all ! No matter what side they're on, you get sucked into their story and live their lives as it was your own.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm starting book 3 cause I can't wait to see what will happen to all these characters.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|To me this the farewell of David Lynch, his epitaph as well. Several of the actors that had acting with him act again in this movie. Few some scenes of other of his pictuers are remake in this movie. When I see Lynch stories I don't interpret the story, I only try to feel the atmospheres he creates. In fact, to me the stories are simple, but the way he tell these stories are very original, bizarre, dense. And were are the red curtains in this movie?
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I loved A Feast for Crows!<br />Although I had to miss some of my favorite characters in this book, I still loved it to bits.<br />What can I say, I love all this scheming and back-stabbing, the \\"Game of Thrones\\" as it is called in the book.<br /><br />In this book Cersei was my favorite charachter by far. She tries so hard to be the Queen, convinced that she is the great ruler that everyone is waiting for. Always paranoid and thinking everyone is out to get her, always scheming, one devious plan after another. I just love her!<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not rooting for her to stay on the throne. I wanna see her fall from her pedestal... I wanna see her fall, fail and be left all on her own with no one left at her side to help her.<br /><br />I'm off to book 5!
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I wanted to compare this version to the original.They did a good job but for me I still like the original better.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved A Storm of Swords!<br />It is a huge book with it's 1000+ pages, but it never felt like the book was too long because there was so much happening and I just wanted to keep reading.<br /><br />There are some many twists and turns in this book, some expected but others totally unexpected. I loved all the intrigue, betrayal, fighting that was going on.<br />All that struggle for power, plotting to take each others land, castle, title, wife or kingdom...<br /><br />The characters are so well written that I really feel like I know them. I even sympathized with some of the more evil ones like Jaime and Tyrion cause when you see the story from their side you can see they're not all bad. All these different points of view from all these characters make it so much more interesting to read.<br /><br />At one point in the book though, about halfway, I was completely in shock with how the story went. I never expected that 2 characters that I really loved would be killed. It's not something many authors do. When I finished that one chapter I put my kindle down for the evening cause I needed some time to adjust to the idea. But the next evening I was as eager as ever to read on cause this very unexpected twist in the story ment that it would be taking a whole other turn, one I didn't expect in a million years.<br /><br />I really recommend this book, and the series up till now. I have 2 more books to read in this series and I really hope Mr Martin won't keep us waiting too long for the next ones. I'm off to start book 4!
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because of the wonderful reviews, but I just didn't get it.  Very hard to keep up with the characters.

0765322889|5.0|Wow.  I haven't read anything quite this good since the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.  Details, summaries and reviews have been provided elsewhere so I won't repeat.  I didn't find the novel confusing at all as so many others opinions I've read.  In fact, I was so impressed with the depth and writing style that my entire focus was on it and I don't think I missed much, if anything.  Knowing that this is a massive epic fantasy has me excited and grateful to have a series to enjoy for months (which is finished, yay!!)<br /><br />The only other thing I would say at this point, after reading Garden's of the Moon only, but moving on to Deadhouse Gates and etc., is that imo Erikson's work rivals - yes, and perhaps even surpasses - the greats such as Tolkien, and I'd predict he will only be more deeply appreciated as the years go by and more and more people discover his work.  Thank you, Steven Erikson!

B0001WTVUW|5.0|This made-for-TV movie originally aired the same year I graduated from high school and went off to college.  It was definitely a product of its time.  I don't think a movie like this could be made, much less broadcast on network TV, during any other period of American history.  It perfectly captured the mood of the day, and the fears that we all had back then.  The US-Soviet d&eacute;tente of the 1970s was well and truly over; and the Cold War was hotter than it had been at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The hawkish anticommunist crusader, Ronald Reagan, had been in the White House for over two years; and it would be another two years before the pragmatic reformer and peacemaker, Mikhail Gorbachev, would rise to the top position in the Kremlin.  Arms control negotiations between the two superpowers had broken down; and the nuclear arms race was rapidly escalating.  Reagan administration officials were openly discussing the notion of \\"winnable nuclear war\\" and the potential benefits of developing a \\"first strike\\" capability.  Meanwhile, Soviet troops were bogged down in Afghanistan, fighting a costly war against Islamist insurgents (or \\"freedom fighters\\" as we called them back then) covertly armed and equipped by the US.  And this was just one of the many \\"proxy wars\\" being waged around the globe between US-backed and Soviet-backed factions.  The public rhetoric between the US and USSR was often quite hostile.  Although it's hard to imagine today, back then it really did seem like the two superpowers were rapidly heading towards an inevitable confrontation that could very well end in nuclear war and the complete destruction of modern civilization.  I can recall, as a high school student in the early Reagan years, having casual conversations with my friends about where we'd rather be in the event of a nuclear war: at ground zero, where we'd be killed instantly and spared the tremendous suffering that survivors would have to face, or in a well-stocked fallout shelter far from ground zero, where we'd have a fighting chance of survival, but would face unimaginable horrors, unbearable hardships, and a very bleak future.  Okay, I'll admit that my friends and I were a little weird; but our concern about the possibility of nuclear war wasn't at all unusual back in the early-1980s.  Everyone back then was worried about nuclear war.  And this movie takes those worries and shows us what would happen if they came true.  The results are even more horrifying than you could imagine.<br /><br />Over the years, many movies have been made about nuclear war; but this movie is unlike any of those other films.  This movie isn't about the actions of politicians and generals.  It isn't about the unique experiences of submarine commanders or B-52 pilots.  It's not a spy thriller or a post-apocalyptic sci-fi film.  It's not a heroic tale of intrepid survivors beating the odds and rebuilding a new civilization from the rubble of the old.  Instead, it's a bleak, depressing, utterly heartbreaking portrait of what the experience of nuclear war would be like for ordinary citizens in America's heartland.  It is painfully realistic in its portrayal of the horrors of nuclear war.  It doesn't pull any punches.  But it doesn't make things seem worse than they really would be for dramatic effect, either.  What you see in this film is a pretty good approximation of the sort of things that actually would happen in a full-scale thermonuclear war.  In a way, this movie is much more frightening than any horror film; because this could really happen.  (Fortunately, the odds of it happening are much, much lower today than they were when this movie first aired; but there's still a chance it could happen.)  This is nightmare fuel.  If you're the sort of person who can't watch horror films because you find them too disturbing, then you probably shouldn't watch this.  Likewise, if you hate depressing movies that don't have happy endings, this really isn't the film for you.  Though, personally, I actually felt pretty good after watching this the other night.  It kinda lifted my spirits, in a perverse sort of way, by putting things into perspective.  After watching this, and seeing the absolute worst thing that realistically could happen, my life seems pretty good by comparison, and the problems I'm dealing with and challenges I'm facing seem almost trivial.  It was oddly therapeutic.  (Yeah, I know, I'm weird.)<br /><br />If you want to know what it would be like to live through a full-scale thermonuclear war, then this is definitely the movie to watch.  It's rather melodramatic in places; but that was fairly typical for TV shows and made-for-TV movies in the early '80s.  Like I said before, it was a product of its time.  So, I'm going to cut it some slack in terms of the melodrama, and say that it's a good film in spite of its frequent emotional clumsiness.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning more about the effects of nuclear war.

0060574216|1.0|I'm sorry but this book, even just based on the title is illogical and absurd.<br /><br />Perhaps if it was written in the 19th century, when we thought that human beings could live on both Venus and Mars this book could be excused, since it would be based on the science of that era despite that knowledge being very outdated now.  But it isn't, it is a modern enough book that the author should have known that the surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead, that at the surface that atmospheric pressure is much, much greater then here on earth, and that the atmosphere has way too much carbon dioxide and probably other gasses to make it safe to breathe.  Likewise, Mars cannot sustain human life, the air is much too thin, due to that and it's distance from the sun it's much too cold, and correct me if I am wrong but the atmosphere, even if it was thicker I do believe is poisonous to some degree also.<br /><br />So obviously, women cannot be from Venus.  Nor men from Mars.
B002V091IO|4.0|What a marvelous light read. What i liked most about this book was the humour, brilliant observations and one-liners from Nicholl. The plot is classic will she won't she, or rather will he won't he. At times you feel like hitting both characters for being ineffectual ditherers, but it's the flaws in our characters that make us root for them, and i was really routing for the heroine throughout.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|Paris. Beautiful, foreign, historic, romantic Paris. It's been at almost 15 years since I was in Paris, but I haven't forgotten such an amazing city. And the food... mmmm... the food! So imagine a story about young love in Paris, and Stephanie Perkins has hit the literary jackpot with Anna and the French Kiss.<br /><br />Anna's annoying father decided she needed to experience a new culture... for her senior year! The last thing Anna wants is to leave her friends, her school, her little brother, and her new possibly-future boyfriend for a country where she doesn't even speak the language. When she is dropped off at SOAP (School of America at Paris), she realizes just how alone she is. Luckily, she isn't alone for long. Quickly she meets a group of friends who includes a very cute, and very unavailable guy named Etienne St. Clair. Anna knows St. Clair is dating someone, but she can't help but stare at him with those dreamy eyes and think about him every time he is gone. She knows Toph is home, hopefully waiting for her, but she can't stop thinking about St. Clair.<br /><br />As the months pass, Anna realizes just St. Clair is, but he seems to be miserable in his relationship. When they spend Thanksgiving break together, just the two of them, Anna realizes she feels more for St. Clair than she ever did for Toph. When she finally goes home to see her family for Christmas, she has a rude awakening waiting for her. While she was in Paris, life went on without her, including Toph. The only thing that holds her together for the 2 weeks she is home is St. Clair's emails and phone calls. When she returns to Paris, she realizes true feelings for St. Clair, but he is still dating another girl. Can Anna bring herself to just be friends with him? Can she forgive the people who all but forgot about her when she moved to Paris? How far will she go to be with St. Clair?<br /><br />Oh, Sarah Dessen fans of the world! I introduce you to the author who is just as amazing as Sarah Dessen- Stephanie Perkins! Oh, Perkins creates the same amazing characters that you can't get enough of and the most amazing stories you will want to read again and again. In fact, you will become just as obsessed with Perkins as you have with Dessen- I know I have! Oh Anna was every bit as confused young woman as I wanted her to be (and remember being when I was her age). And all that swoony, wonderful young love? You will fall right into it with this book, just like Anna and St. Clair.<br /><br />This is a great book for those young women who like to read romantic books full of stolen glances, hoped-for kisses, and fiery contact of a leg brushed up against another leg in the movie theater or a hand brushed against another hand at a cafe. This will appeal to a wide range of girls, from older middle school student through high school students. It is a fairly clean story, perfect for the young adult circuit. I don't imagine many boys being interested in it purely for superficial reasons, but you never know! Oh Stephanie Perkins! Thank God(dess) you decided to start writing!n- Stephanie Perkins!

068484267X|5.0|Rarely does a book make me so angry and laugh out loud as well. McCourt captures the extreme end of growing up in poverty in Ireland brilliantly. The stereotypes, the feckless father, equally feckless mother (Angela), the course of drink are however all too true. A great read.
0439813786|5.0|As a teacher of dyslexic students, I appreciate just how hard it is to find a book for a low-skilled older student. Virtually impossible. You don't want to insult the student, but you don't want to frustrate them with a book that is entirely too difficult. And what about your emergent readers? Older students who are just learning to read. Do you give them picture books and chapter books? What if you had a really beautiful story, full of gorgeous illustrations disguised as usual middle reader book (except much bigger and much heavier)? Brian Selznick created a masterpiece with The Invention of Hugo Cabret, but when he did, I am sure he didn't realize he was creating a bridge for emergent readers into the world of book lovers.<br /><br />Hugo was orphaned twice. When his father was killed in a fire in his workshop working on a device Hugo wanted him to fix, Hugo was sent to live with his uncle. Hugo's uncle lived in the train station and was responsible for winding all the clocks twice a day. It wasn't the hardest job in the world, but it took a lot of responsibility so the clocks didn't fall behind and break down. When Hugo's uncle disappears, Hugo takes over the clocks and keeps up the ruse his uncle is still there because he has no other place to go.<br /><br />Unable to cash his uncle's checks, Hugo is forced to steal his food. He only steals out of necessity, except for toys. Hugo can't resist the toy booth run by the old man, but when he is caught stealing a toy mouse, the old man forces him to fix it. He takes Hugo's notebook- the last thing Hugo has from his father that holds the secrets to fixing the device his father died trying to fix for Hugo- the automaton. Hugo salvaged the automaton from the building where his father was killed, but without the notebook, he will never get the figure to work. When the old man sees Hugo's ability to fix the toy, he puts him to work fixing toys in the shop. By day Hugo works in the shop, but night he works on the automaton. It is a busy life, but Hugo just wants his notebook back. When the old man's goddaughter promises to get it back for him, he doesn't realize the secrets they will uncover together. There is more to the old man than Hugo ever realized, but then again, the old man didn't know Hugo was an orphan living in the train station either.<br /><br />The beauty of this book, besides the pages and pages of beautiful illustrations, was the ability of those illustrations to tell huge parts of the story. An emergent reader must look at a book and be completely overwhelmed by all those words. Pages and pages of words. So what if half the story was told by a series of illustrations that wordlessly told a beautiful story of a sad boy who finds people who care about him? I love this book for many reasons, but the biggest reason is that I can just see a student who is just starting to read being able to successfully wade through this book in all its bulk (500+ pages) and know they have read a book. Imagine the pride that would come from that student?<br /><br />So I have to say, I think Selznick is a genius. He created a book that is not only beautiful, but one that can appeal to even the most low-skilled students. I think it is an important book for any children's library or classroom, especially for students with learning disabilities. The illustrations can emote with little effort and will provide tons of material for discussions. You can have students write the dialogue or describe the illustrations as an activity. If a student is creative, you can have them illustrate the portions of the book that aren't already illustrated. The opportunities are limitless..

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Finished the first 3 seasons on Netflix in less than a week and had to see season 4 so I bought it on Amazon instant video.  Yet another amazing season which ends in jawdropping fashion.  Can't wait for the new season in July.  Best show I've ever seen, period.  Watch it!
B007R41E8O|1.0|just like everybody said it took 5 times of downloading the data pack for it to open the game, then all the dialogue boxes were just white boxes over the screen. there's something very wrong with this game. incredible 2 HTC
B006OB3K56|2.0|I was waiting to see this film it was so much hype about it well to say I was let down is a understatement.I had an open mind about this film because so many ppl complaining about frontal nudity(really)lol even though his was impressive!!!OH yes it is but I just don,t understand he had sex with everybody even a encounter with a man,yeah dont start I didn,t have a problem with that at all but when it came to the actress who happens to be black oh noooooooo we can,t show that they may use the excuse oh its because he really liked her but I dont buy it but IM not a director so.It just seems to me when it comes to hollywood when ever its a interracial couple they never want to fully go there you know famous white male and a lesser known black actress we can,t have none of that it may upset the masses.I know ppl will dissagree its ok its just my opinion and another thing the interaction between him and his sister was irritating yes I said irritaing I know what happens to her at the end but irritating none the less.so there you have it please don,t allow my opinion in anyway stop you from seeing this film it does after all shed some light on sexual addiction. blur-ray is the only way the quality is amazing almost too clear and real!
B007Q476KU|5.0|I am fan of war movies in the context of learning a part of our history.  I have watched \\"War Dogs of the Pacific\\" to learn about the sacrifice that canines gave during WWII.  I watched \\"War Horse\\" with the same ideal. I read the book (via amazon kindle of course!) prior to watching movie.  I grew up with a horse and they have always held a level of mystery for me.  I read the book - a young adult book - and found the book to be a fair warning of the movie.  I cried while reading the book and cried even more while watching the movie.  There were scenes that were difficult to watch because you not only see the sacrifice that horses made during WWI but you see another animal actually forming a friendship and bond with another animal. That, to me, is was what made the movie so emotional.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love love love :)<br />This is an incredible novel so sexy!<br />I was hooked right away, my mother and grandmother love it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This Book is amazing! I read it like four times, and for only $5 thats a good price. I can see it perfectly in light or in the dark, and there is no glare. If you don't know a word you can look it up, and highlight a phrase or something with meaning. Overall this is a great that you SHOULD buy.

0399159029|5.0|Prague Fatale by Philip Kerr is a fic­tional book in the Bernie Gun­ther series. This is the eighth book in the series which brings up the ques­tion: just how many lives does Bernie Gun­ther has?<br /><br />Bernie Gun­ther returns from the Easter Front to find that 1941 Berlin is not the city he left - and not for the bet­ter. Life is unpleas­ant in Berlin due to black­outs, Czech ter­ror­ists, RAF bomb­ings and food rationing.<br /><br />When Bernie's old boss Rein­hard Hey­drich of the Sicher­heits­di­enst (SD) orders him to Prague to spend the week­end in his coun­try house with senior SS and SD fig­ures, Bernie is obliged to drop every­thing and go. When a mur­der is com­mit­ted in a room that was locked from the inside, the relax­ing week­end turns hec­tic and Bernie is asked to inves­ti­gate the mystery.<br /><br />When I first read Prague Fatale by Philip Kerr I was a bit con­fused since the series appears out of chrono­log­i­cal order. The first book I read in the series, Field Gray (my thoughts), was the sev­enth and I imme­di­ately knew I'd want to read more. I actu­ally bought the col­lec­tion of the first three nov­els titled Berlin Noir but haven't got­ten around to read­ing them yet.<br /><br />Bernie Gun­ther is the per­fect anti-hero, a tough and cyn­i­cal Berliner, he is appalled by him­self, the job he has to do, the coun­try he loves and the peo­ple he works for and with. Bernie goes through life, ago­niz­ing over past actions, try­ing to do as lit­tle dam­age as pos­si­ble, using a wry gal­lows humor as a defense strategy.<br /><br />It's amaz­ing how many times, just in the two books I've read, Bernie comes close to death. The way he talks to upper Nazi offi­cials he should have ended up with a bul­let through the head, or worst, half way through the book. In the novel Alone in Berlin by Hans Fal­lada (Every Man Dies Alone in the US) which is based on a true story, the two pro­tag­o­nist get handed a death sen­tence for doing much less. How­ever they did not have Bennie's high level Nazi con­tacts (\\"Vit­a­min P\\"), his army record (which includes some hor­rific acts) or his skills and cunning.<br /><br />The plot is skill­fully arranged, cen­ter­ing around a locked room mur­der in the sum­mer cas­tle of Rein­hard Hey­drich, Reich­spro­tec­tor of Bohemia, a fencer, musi­cian, fan of a Agatha Christie as well as one of the cru­elest and most bru­tal in Nazi Ger­many known as \\"The Hang­man\\" -- and he's also Bernie's boss. The set­ting, Prague and a cas­tle full of Nazis, is bril­liant and shows that even mon­sters tend to blend into one another in a close set­ting. Towards the end, Mr. Kerr reminds us, in gra­tu­itous detail, what the Nazis are capa­ble of and that the r&eacute;gime is more than just an excuse for amusement.<br /><br />More inter­est­ing than the mur­der is Bernie's inter­nal strug­gle to keep a piece of his human­ity intact. Con­stantly strug­gling with a death wish, the pro­tag­o­nist is not afraid to speak his mind to com­mit death-by-Nazi and free him of his night­mares caused by par­tic­i­pat­ing in mass mur­ders on the East­ern front (Russia).<br /><br />The bril­liant aspect of Kerr's books, aside from the absorb­ing yarns, is that the set­tings are skill­fully com­posed and bring a life of their own into the tales. The blacked out cities, dif­fi­cult life, hunger and dis­ease have a noir feel which can barely be cap­tured on screen. Another aspects I love about Mr. Kerr's books is that he does not under­es­ti­mate his read­er­ship, when you read a Bernie Gun­ther novel you would need to know your his­tory in order to under­stand the sar­donic humor, period hypocrisies and best of all, the dis­turb­ing nor­malcy of unhinged authority.nist get handed a death sen­tence for doing much less.

0345803485|5.0|The best book I have read in a really long time! Read it in 3 days! I bought the 2nd book before I was finished with the first. You can read all the other reviews to get a general idea of the plot but read it for yourself...it is a GREAT read! The 2nd book is not letting me down so far either![[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
1610660242|5.0|Deliv­er­ing Hap­pi­ness: A Path to Prof­its Pas­sion and Pur­pose by Tony Hsieh is a short­ened, graphic ver­sion of the famous book by the suc­cess­ful entre­pre­neur. Tony is the CEO of Zap­pos, an online shoe seller.<br /><br />Deliv­er­ing Hap­pi­ness: A Path to Prof­its Pas­sion and Pur­pose by Tony Hsieh is a won­der­ful graphic adap­ta­tion of the book and cer­tainly brings out the main points across. As with many good busi­ness books, this one also left me with ideas on how to imple­ment what I learned at my job.<br /><br />Tony is an entre­pre­neur by blood. He started his own earth­worm farm at 9, moved on to news­pa­per routes and made cus­tom but­tons and more. As Tony dis­cov­ered com­put­ers he became a tester for video games, a pro­gram­mer and worked for Ora­cle while cre­at­ing LinkEx­change. Tony's com­pany was sold to Microsoft for $265 million.<br /><br />Always look­ing for the next great oppor­tu­nity, Tony started a ven­ture cap­i­tal com­pany and got involved with Zappos.com. Along the way the author learned many life lessons, includ­ing his desire to be ful­filled. A desire, I must say, which is much eas­ier to achieve with a pocket full of money!<br /><br />Tony founded Zap­pos through his angel invest­ing com­pany, he poured a lot of his own money into the com­pany and helped it become the multi-million dol­lar suc­cess story it is today - and remain happy in the process.<br />No small achievement.<br /><br />Along the way Tony talks about the areas Zap­pos invested their time and money in (cul­ture, employee train­ing and cus­tomer ser­vices) as well as how to install core val­ues in your employ­ees and the \\"Top 10 ways to instill cus­tomer ser­vices into your company\\".<br /><br />The last few pages talk about hap­pi­ness and com­pany cul­ture. While I really enjoyed this graphic adap­ta­tion I think I will buy the book if, for noth­ing else, but this last section.ion.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Works great, just no as easy to use as others I already have. Looks great. works great, and I use it.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|The film could have been better, and more successful, if the people who make films took the time to find out what people like AND DON'T LIKE in a film. After being victimized by The Good Heart, I've tried to avoid the same happening again, but you just don't see it coming. (There, no spoiler!)<br />The acting was fine, btw.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|One of the funniest books you will ever read!  The character of Ignatius Reilly is such a wonderful buffoon and so rich in imagination.
0439023521|5.0|Having seen and enjoyed the film of the first book I thought I'd take a chance and download the trilogy. I've not read YA or teen fiction for a very long time. I was pleasantly surprised by what this book had to offer. The author's narrative flowed excellently and she made effective use of the, these days, often under used device of ending some chapters on a cliff hanger.<br /><br />I found the main character of Katniss to be very well drawn and deep enough to be satisfying, even to an adult reader such as myself. The author didn't skirt the big issues and we find the story exploring such issues as starvation, oppression and even death in its most brutal form.<br /><br />One or two parts of the plot were a little undeveloped but not so much so as to spoil your enjoyment. Generally it's a well rounded and well characterised book. You have to accept that it would be difficult to give us depth on ALL of the tributes.<br /><br />The author has succeeded in creating a whole new world that I wanted to explore more. A great adventure story. I look forward to reading the other two parts of the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this down. I read all three books in 2 days. the Suspence was awesome. I would purchase more books along this subject matter.
0896898288|4.0|The quilt blocks are beautiful, and I love the concept.  It's enlightening to read the letters from farmer's wives, and their words will make the quilt so much more meaningful to me (once I finish it!).  However, I really hate that I have to print each template separately.  It's a huge waste of time, paper and ink.  Why couldn't templates be grouped together, so that the printed page is full?

B0073U2F2Q|1.0|Just bought this on Blu-ray. I watched about 45 mins, and had to turn it off. This has to be one of the worst holidays movies out there. To be relased around Christmas time, usually movies are pretty decent. This was straight up bad. I would not recommend wasting time watching this flick. It was a B-rated type movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My daughter watched the movie first and then we hunted down the book, which was much better! She loved the book so much I had to read it. This book is definitely in the same class as the first Harry Potter Books, C.S. Lewis Chronicals of Narnia, etc. and around that reading level. A definite must read for the fantasy enthusiast!
0375842209|1.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" offers a worthy story drowned in bad writing. The author's attempts at edgy and arty turn sour and tiresome with choppy paragraphs and clumsy wording. Many sections read like parodies of poems written by Beatniks in 1950's coffee houses. I will not drop this off at the local Goodwill. \\"The Book Thief\\" goes straight in the trash.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simply addictive. Hard to describe how the game grabs and doesn't let go. Definitely recommended!!! music is very soothing and relaxing. love this game.
B007REABAG|5.0|Currently this box set is only available through a website called Pop Market. They specialize in the reissuing of the Columbia/Epic/Legacy/Sony/BMG music labels. They offer remastered multi-disc album collections.  I just purchased my copy for $89.99 and I must say it's totally worth the money.  In case you're wondering, yes the 1977-1980 albums are the exact same remasters that came out a few years a ago (1998 and 2006). They include the same exact bonus tracks, except \\"At Budokan\\" is the 2-disc complete concert and the \\"Found All The Parts\\" EP is removed from \\"All Shook Up\\" and given it's own separate disc.  The 1981-1990 albums are beautifully remastered by Vic Anesini, the same engineer who remastered the earlier CD's but, sadly no bonus tracks.  It's kinda lame that they don't offer them individually and that you have to buy an expensive set but the sound upgrade on the later albums is superb.  It's normally $99.99 but, I used the coupon code: Sony10 and got 10% off.
B006OB3K56|1.0|Beware, this is an Android only Digital Copy. It will not download if you only have iTunes/iPhone. Fox, in all their wisdom, is punishing iTunes users because of their disagreements with Apple.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this Trilogy, just finished the third book today. I want more !!! I have to say that I wasn't sure about it at first, but I am glad I went a head with buying them. I love Christian and Anastasia, they are so cute. I also have to say that I like that there was a little bit of everything, not just sex. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat in some parts. I am excited about the possibility of a movie, I'll be here waiting! :) I might as well say who I think should play these two characters.... Colin Egglesfield as Christian & Alexis Bledel as Anastasia.
B001QXCYZY|4.0|First things first, I would like to say that for what you pay, this microphone is unbelievable.  It has terrific sound quality for recording both vocals and instruments.  There are a few downsides, but for what you pay, it's still a very good mic.  The first noticeable problem is that it is fairly quiet, you almost have to eat it to get it to peak when you are singing.  The second problem is that there is a noticeable amount of white noise in the background, but it can be removed with a noise gate or noise removal software and it is still much quieter than any other mic I have personally owned.  Overall it's an excellent mic, and I am very pleased with it.  On top of just the mic it comes with a 15-foot USB cable (I really don't know if you'll need anything longer than that unless you are doing something crazy with it...)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was interesting from beginning to end.  It is recommended for teens, but I am 72 and thoroughly loved the book.

0811876373|4.0|I just purchased a baby cake pop maker and figured I needed an \\"idea\\" book to go with it. Honestly, I bought this based on others excellent reviews and the owl pops that are on the front. My daughters first birthday is coming up and owls are the theme.<br />Little did I know there are sooo many cute ideas in this book! I am very impressed with the variety of designs, and how there are so many tips for people that don't really know what they are doing (like myself!). I can see myself trying lots of these adorable ideas. If you are looking for a \\"recipe\\" book for cake pops (especially with great kids designs for numerous occasions) this is a great choice!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|In reading several of the reviews, I was surprised that none I read discussed the quality of the recording. I'll digress for a moment and then get back to the Love recording sonic characteristics later.<br /><br />The Beatles Anthology collection of all of their albums, plus the bonus Masters in mono, was touted as being sonically superior to the initial CD pressings of the albums, but was a huge disappointment. People wrote that the mono anthology collection was as The Beatles would have heard the recording when they made them, suggesting an almost live quality to the sound. Nothing could be farther from the truth. That collection was not worth the purchase, if you already owned the initial CD pressings.<br /><br />After purchasing the collection, I assumed that the tapes were just sonically inferior to later recordings, even from the mid '70s.<br /><br />However, with the issue of Love, I see that the tapes were not the limiting factor. Love is sonically brilliant. What an absolute delight to hear these songs, albeit modified to some degree by George and Giles Martin. Oh would they have allowed Martin and son to get their hands on the original tapes for the anthology collection.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how clear and sonically thrilling the Love CD is. While I first was shocked and disappointed that the Martin's \\"messed\\" with the Beatles' songs, I soon got over it. Playing after playing has been the pleasure I had hoped I would get from the anthology collection.<br /><br />So, Love proves that the recordings CAN be redone from the master tapes and I hope that they will some day be done.<br /><br />Buy Love and if you want the anthology in mono at a steal of a price - contact me! I'd like to dump it and listen to my original CD's and then Love when I must have sonic clarity.<br /><br />BTW, I believe that reviewers should list the equipment they listen to the recording on. I listen on Audio Research D300 amp, LS2 preamp, Dynaudio Contour 2.8 speakers andCal Audio CD player.<br /><br />Buy Love, get past that these are not the songs in their original version and enjoy this marvelous recording. Look to other positive reviews for comments about the Martin's work on this CD. I'll merely say I enjoy their work/interpretation very much.

B0071QIN00|1.0|this is the worst game I have ever played. physics are absolutely retarded, its restarts at checkpoints in stupid positions- and it doesn't even allow you to exit out of it. Along with that, ever since I downloaded the game, my device has been crashing continuously every time<br />I open the game. Last but not least, once out of about three times that I open the app, it immediatley freezes up and forces the device into restart. This is absolutley without a doubt the worst app Ive ever bought. Please, save your money and lets hope this trash is deleted.

B005LAIGW8|1.0|The first Ghost Rider is good, this one is beyond terrible! I saw this movie in the Theater with my wife and son and we all had the same reaction. We all wanted to walk out! When the Ghost rider appears, he just stands there and looks stupid until he grabs a bad guy and just opens his mouth at him and growls or whatever he did. The directors said they wanted to see what happened to a skull when the set one on fire...it turned black so they went with that look,but Ghost Riders fire is mystical and doesn't burn his skull like real life! Even his motorcycle was sad. Don't even bother renting this garbage movie!
