B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I loved the old, &#34;Tron!&#34;  But this always is entertaining and has stunning effects.  The story-line is a good one and touching.  I really enjoyed this movie!
B004BLTNM0|5.0|This is an excellent thriller! I have watched it several times.This video is a great price, and it was shipped really fast! I would recommend the company to anyone who asks!
0062278096|5.0|What a great book to read for Sherlock fans! Loved it! It's nice they came out with this book on the off season so Sherlock fans have something new to do while waiting for Season 3! :D
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Many LOL moments throughout. I mean many. Very personally revealing. Should be recommended reading for all young women. Life lessons through very personal experiences - and good advise for young women starting off in business.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|LOOOOOVED THE VIDEO, MUST WATCH AGAIN, WHAT A REUNION , I HAD N EVER , EVER SEEN THAT VIDEO , AMAZING PERFORMANCE AND LIVE, NO DUBBING HERE
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I love this show! it's well written, fast moving and reels you in after 1 episode.  Season three is off to a great start!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a exstremly fun game. Its better then temple run. It has many things that are fun about it like how you can get dragons and stuff. This ie a good hale that I think a ton of people would like.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE it!!!  Product is brand new, sealed and perfect!!!!  I would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!!!!!  Thank you again!!! :-)<br /><br />******5 stars all the way******
B000FCK65W|3.0|I know it's a classic, but it's a chicks novel. However, it's a book that every one should read and have on their bucket list.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE it!!!  Product is brand new, sealed and perfect!!!!  I would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!!!!!  Thank you again!!! :-)<br /><br />******5 stars all the way******
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|3rd book of the set; almost done reading - action packed! My imagination is captivated by all the sci- fi action & hardware. Character names are interesting. Would recommend the series.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE it!!!  Product is brand new, sealed and perfect!!!!  I would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!!!!!  Thank you again!!! :-)<br /><br />******5 stars all the way******
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another absolute gem. Makes you think! Hope Khaled has many more wonderful stories in him. Each book makes you more aware of the complex issues in Afghanistan.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought this book was way better than the 4th. I almost didnt get this book due to how disappointed I was in the 4th and how many characters seemed to be getting introduced and not seeming to wrap up existing plots. However, I couldn't read that many books and not finish the series. And I am so glad I did. 5th was an amazing book!
1480054542|5.0|I got this book for free and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  As soon as I finished it I purchased the remaining books in the Pride Series that was available.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I found the movie interesting, the plot however was not original and rather &#34;borrowed&#34; from the previous classic syfy movies... I liked the dialogues, pace of the movie and photography. Of course, Tom Cruise was great and the ladies: Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko did very well. One thing that annoys me is that every commercial and/or trailer for this movie shows Morgan Freeman along with Tom Cruise as the main characters. BUT don't be fooled: Mrs Freeman's name (whom I adore) is there only to attract more viewer, I guess. To sum, I liked the movie but it is not in the category &#34;never to forget&#34;.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to learn and lots of fun! Would recommend for all ages. Game works flawlessly and has not crashed on me.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Clearly, the best JGB disc. For those looking for pure Jerry, when his playing and vocals are at his best, then this is a must purchase. The solos were magnificent and went on and on, something that I long for in more recent recordings. Obviously, Jerry wasn't able to perform at such a high level in his later years, and I always disagreed with those who thought the late 80s and early 90s was Jerry's best, or at least some of his best stuff.  Ironically, that period was the only time I was able to see the GD in person, and when I did I loved them, but in retrospect I admit that his finest days were in the late 70s and very early 80s.  I always preferred JG's stuff in GD and I have always been on the lookout for his best stuff, and I think it is solidly displayed here, albeit in JGB.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is the best representation of the JGB. If you can have only one, then this is it.
B003ES61EE|5.0|An inexpensive option to the 'name brand' pens.  It works well, just as it should.  There isn't much to break or screw up on this item.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy game.  Just aim and touch. Great fun for those that do not invest days in app games.  I would recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|amazing tv and so much better production values than usual tv. so happy for pbs!! hope the series goes long and strong...well done!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a very good book . With an insight to something a lot of people are blindtoo. Very well-written!
0375758992|4.0|This was really an amazing book. It is amazing to me what people can survive, and how messed up childhood can be. This was a very intense book, and I found that I had to take small breaks while reading it. The other side of that coin is that it was so well written, and so very interesting, that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it. Don't get me wrong, the book isn't all doom and gloom, there is a lot of humor mixed in. I think the truly amazing thing about this book, is knowing this is actually someones life. One thing the book kept making me wonder though, what do Impala steaks taste like? Which felt especially odd when I was sitting in the car, a Chevy Impala, reading.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Almost like the English version of Little House on the Prairie. A very gentle series. And I love the fashions.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Regrettably, the last of Vince Flynn's novels.  Exceptionally difficult to put down (as were all his other books).  He is sorely missed.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story in this book isnt bad but it advances way to fast from poor farmer to being proclaimed one of the king's family - which then seems to be forgotten by everyone.<br /><br />he also has TWO first times drinking in the book... id say there are about 4 chapters that need to be removed all together or redone to reflect the rest of the book
B008K3HRF0|5.0|great movie for the kiddos and kids at heart(that would be adults)! We have watched it many times, never gets old!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I loved this movie. action, drama, little bit of comedy, all in one movie. the best movie I have seen all year! Very well done! must see!
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|This was more hype than anything. Redford had more class and carried it off far better. This one does have more flash, but over all missed the depth of character. If you want flash watch this one, if you want acting and substance, watch the original.
B009CPES4I|3.0|knew nothing about this movie before I watching it. a cute movie & surprisingly pleasant. good for a rainy day inside.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Phenomenal film and yet another thrilling adventure from visionary director JJ Abrams. Intense, fast-paced, and an adrenaline rush from beginning to end.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|as good as one & two. another good mib movie. this is a must see movie. funny & well made
1612130283|5.0|GOOD READ, I READ ALL THREE BOOKS AND PASS THEM OFF FOR OTHERS TO READ !!!!!  NOW WAITING FOR THE MOVIE
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Loved it. This coming of age tale will draw inevitable comparisons to Rothfuss' Kvothe, but I'm going to go ahead and say it: I enjoyed this much, much more, as I empathized far more with Vaelin, who skews strongly toward the more mature side of growing up (while not necessarily being \\"perfect\\"), than the stupidly adolescent side (contrary to literary belief, not everyone is a complete idiot while traveling to adulthood). It also has a dash of Peter F. Hamilton's Night's Dawn series (never fear, this is definitely fantasy, not space opera), and the combination of the two makes for a heck of an intriguing potential story unfolding in subsequent volumes in this series.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this was initially self-published.<br /><br />I would also protest that this is hardly a brutal story as some reviewers suggest. It's not all unicorns and rainbows obviously, and does have its bittersweet moments as all coming of age stories must, but neither is it even remotely grimdark in any way.<br /><br />If I had a quibble (I can overlook the poor editing in the US version, as none of it interfered with my understanding), it would be the last parts of the story. I wasn't sure what assumption we were supposed to make for why Vaelin allowed himself to be put in that particular circumstance after his mission had been accomplished, though I went ahead and went with his sense of honor. It was also not entirely clear to me if the historian was being told the same story we were reading. It really seemed he wasn't, which kind of defeats the purpose of that literary convention, unless there will be another reason further down the road for why the author chose to do it that way (or, I am totally mixed up about this). I also felt the Witch's Bastard story within a story could have been a little more subtle in exposition. Oh, and one of the side character's had a romance that was a jarringly...sudden and out of left-field, but I can overlook that as well.<br /><br />None of that causes me to give this story less than 5 stars though. Anything self-published that is this good (or better), deserves it, to help stand out from the morass of mediocrity that spams the Kindle book store making it next to impossible to actually find anything good (it's so bad that I actually end up mostly browsing Amazon's non-Kindle book store instead, and then buying the Kindle version of anything that looks promising).<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting book 2, and can only hope it doesn't take as many years as certain other authors when writing sequels. :D
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I can't stop listening to it..... love every song on the album.... I recommend everyone to get it. can't  wait  to hear them sing the songs live.....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it great game mind racer have to do lots of thinking time passer never a dull moment lots to learn great mind exercise
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It took a while for me to become submerged, but once it caught my interest, I couldn't put it down. Excited for the next installment.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Like I said, good to kill time, ads are annoying, gets boring later on in the game. But overall it's not bad.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy and fun to play.  Well worth it and i like the addition of upgrading the missles. Good bathroom game to help kill time
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is really fun. You can keep playing it for hours on end. Very cool concept. Hakuna matata. Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle yeh.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Thais is the awesomest remake of that machine that took enough quarters from me to make enemies of anyone that had a piggy bank when i was 14....worth every rupee.
0062255657|5.0|This book was a gift and delighted the birthday  recipients my daughter and son-in-law.  It has become shared and discussed and inspiring to them and their friends.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is certainly a very great fps game. I highly recommend it. The online multiplayer is really fun with the vehicles and cool weapons.
0515142247|5.0|Another great chapter in the Lee Childs series, this book grabs you and pulls you in right from the start and never lets go...Jack Reacher's char even better in this one then the first amazing read highly recomended! 5stars all the way
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pe is an awsome game. Definitely worth my money. Download block launcher for texture packs and to change your skin.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This game is horrible all you do is fly I suggest you do NOT get This this is great advice.
B009DH379C|5.0|Very happy with this version of this concert<br />I had the old VHS and watch it over and over ...the quality was so poor<br />the sound so weak...<br />  I put this dvd through my surround system and my 50&#34; HD screen TV<br />OH MY GOD...the results were amazing!!!!<br /><br />  I wish Queen would do more re-releases like this one .,on Blue Ray<br /><br />this one is a must have for Queen fans!
0316067598|5.0|This book, written by Marcus Luttrell was outstanding. I have read both of his books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. The Navy Seals go through the toughest training in the Military. I don't believe that they are given near enough recognition for their sacrifices. The majority of them have re-enlisted at least once to endure the training required of them. The majority are career Sailors. May God bless each and every one of them.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|my 2yr old lover's it kisses I'm be up all nite playing it as long as my kids go to bed soon
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's as highly addictive game for young people and well worth the time. It's as wonderful as friends the tv show.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A very significant sound studio in rock history that I knew nothing about before watching this movie. I found it very interesting and entertaining.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this game is amazing for kids .Even it ur not a kid (like an adult and u dont really like it) u should get it if ur bored. :D mabey...  (written by my daughter years ago)
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|this worked well, but the video had a buzz because the microphone and the sound system were not compatible. could not tell until I began to edit.
B008M87GJK|2.0|The app made no difference to the appearance or operation of the site (though there are more amazon adverts appearing).
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not like the movie, and yet... Solid pace, and so realistic. Characters reappear, giving the narrative continuity. It reads FAST.
0937381888|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Corner was a bit bent but its cool! Now let's brew something good and refreshing!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love Secret Society Hidden Mystery.The graphics are fab.Really like the puzzles.It's more than just a object finding game.Great exercise for the brain.
0375413405|5.0|I read it from beginning to end. The recipes I have tried so far are delicious. Simple and do not require special pots or utensils
B0006AAS5G|3.0|I was looking for a watch with a steel band and this is ok but hard to read the time in low light.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Loved this book. I can't wait to read the rest of the stories about Pride! I will definitely look for more books by this author.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Almost like Command &amp; Conquer for Pc. Very immersive &amp; challenging,  fun too. Lots of units,  vehicles,  buildings &amp; upgrades.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Have really enjoyed playing. Reminds me of family fun times when family was close, now we're all over the place.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|Purchased mine last week. It arrived a day later than promised. Box was in great condition but the device did not work AT ALL. The phone never recognized it was connected. Amazon took care of the postage to have it returned but I was very disappointed.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and one I continue to recommend to others! The characters are beautifully well-developed and though the overall setting and many incidents are terribly sad, somehow it all becomes endearing, I guess because it pulls at your heartstrings so. A favorite insight I'm not likely to forget soon was when Death, the narrator, explains that the young soldiers are not running towards each other, they are &#34;running towards me&#34;.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This product was delivered on time, and it's in perfect condition, the artwork on the box is still really good and the dvds play perfectly! :D
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  The slots are awesome.  You need to be able to gift coins though.  You will get to play more slots that way
B0049J3QF4|5.0|my grand kid love it.when are you going to release the version number two ? So we can rent it
B00406UK7S|5.0|5 stars because this film excels in all respects; script, acting, directing, editing, and most importantly culminates in great entertainment. The tale and journey of the fate of Rome's 9th legion is credible (regardless of historical accuracy) and action packed from the get go...lots of relevant gore too (it's a realistic Roman soldier film) ...this production is a collectors item. It is why great talent in making motion pictures requires a solid education and experience....and is so obvious in this epic film.
B0000074FL|5.0|1981's \\"Renegade\\", Thin Lizzy's 11th studio album, is what i would call their lost classic.  After the letdown (chart wise) of \\"Chinatown\\",  (still another great album, even thou most people don't even know about it).  This album brought back guitarist Snowy White (who in my humble opinion did a great job with Thin Lizzy).  Produced by Chris Tsangarides (Concrete Blonde, they covered TL's \\"It's Only Money\\", on their \\"Free album and Judas Priest and many others), he did a tremendous job here.<br />Phil and Scott were knee deep into some bad drug habits, but they pulled thru and kicked major tail in 1981.  The album opens up with the great keyboard intro by Danny Wharton, this propelled \\"Angel Of Death\\", to classic ranks,  Phil is in goose bumping form here.  The title track is a smooth rocker, an A-number 1 tune in the Lizzy catalog.  They kick it up a notch on \\"Pressure Will Blow\\", Scott and Snowy's guitars shine here, the funky rocker \\"Leave This Town\\", great drumming by Brian Downey, their hit \\"Hollywood (Down On Your Luck)\\", excellent rocker, their power-pop take of \\"No One Told Him\\", this should of been the single, very upbeat tune for '81.  \\"Fats\\", \\"He's a real cool cat\\", a dynamic jazz piece, great fretless bass by Phil!  \\"Mexican Blood\\", a mexican themed tune and the melodic rocker \\"It's Getting Dangerous\\".  The drumming of Brian Downey on this disc is tops!<br />Looking foreword to the remastered deluxe versions of \\"Renegade\\" and \\"Thunder and Lightning\\", October 1st.  \\"Renegade\\", will have 5 extra tracks and \\"Thunder\\", will have 15 extra tracks.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is well built and easy to set up. As noted by other reviews, the design is relatively sturdy, with the small exception of the plastic joints connecting the earpieces to the headband. The extendable mic reed is flexible but sturdy, making adjustments easy.<br /><br />In the box are the headset, a base station (not a stand for the headset), and the USB dongle (unfortunately, the headset is not compatible with Logitech's unifying chip, probably because audio requires so much bandwidth). The recommended setup for desktops is to plug the USB dongle into the base station, and then take one of the two USB cords and plug it into the computer. The other USB cord can be used to charge the headset. As a side note, you can charge the headset using this set up, but audio always travels via wireless.<br /><br />I don't claim to be an audiophile, but the quality of the output is stellar for a wireless device. The virtual surround sound didn't impress me very much, but in general the bass can be strong at some times, but you can easily adjust it using the software that comes with the headset. As for the mic, it also works well. Be aware if you use an air filter or something similar in the same room, it will pick up on the repetitive fan noise and make other listeners think you are in a tunnel like situation. It is impressively easy to mute and unmute the mic just by raising and lowering it, respectively. As for comfort, this thing is not likely to fall off your head. The cups are relatively comfortable, the padding is firm but pliant. I can wear this headset without discomfort for hours on end.<br /><br />Battery life is stellar. Depending on usage, you can get up to 8-10 hours out of it. The exception is if you go far reaches or out of range frequently, you can expect your battery life to be cut in half. I find that the range of 40 feet is a good guideline.<br /><br />Overall, I find this headset to be of good quality and build. I would recommend it.
0062255657|5.0|Did I enjoy this book: Of course!  A girl needs her Gaiman fix, doesn't she?<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a dark, quirky little tale that, if you're anything like me, you'll have trouble putting down.  Gaiman creates a fantasy world full of magic and mystery - or maybe it's just a little boy's imagination - I'm not sure it matters much, really.  His characters are, as always, just the right amount of crazy.  I liked Lettie Hempstock so much she might overtake Door (from Neverwhere) on my \\"List of Neil Gaiman Characters to Have Tea With\\"  (Yes, I actually have a list, and YES, that's a preposition at the end of it.  Don't tell my English teacher).<br /><br />I loved it.  I loved this line:  \\"I make art, sometimes I make true art, and sometimes it fills the empty places in my life.\\"  I loved the two moons, the gray and pink monsters, the ponds-that-are-possibly-oceans.  I don't care if the kittens grew out of the ground or not; I willingly suspended my disbelief for Gaiman, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: Yup.  Read it.  At least twice.<br /><br />Will I read it again: I'm already half-way through my second reading.<br /><br />As reviewed by Melissa at Every Free Chance Book Reviews.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game.  Reminds me of the old arcade classic.  The upgrade capability is a nice touch.  Keep up the good work.
0553801473|3.0|I thought this would be the final volume but it seems it's going to stretch on forever which wouldn't be bad if the readers didn't have to wait forever for Winds of Winter and a Dream of Spring. Hopefully the HBO cash will push him into a more productive mode.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This crazy dun awesome game is definitely a five star game I play it every single day I love this game
030726999X|5.0|I really enjoyed this whole series. My brother was dead on correct when he saw me take them out at our summer cottage. &#34;You are screwed&#34; he said. &#34;You will never sleep or put those books down until you get to the end' Enough said.
0064471837|5.0|As a great reader of fantasy since I was a little child, my aunt gifted me with a signed copy of Sabriel.  I have to say it was the best gift I've ever given.<br /><br />When ever I review other books, I have continually compared female characters to Sabriel; Garth Nix has given us a strong female lead, so realistic it feels as if she could be living and breathing in our own world.  She is strong, logical, loving and and loyal with the perfect amount of courage to make her a warrior and just enough vulnerability to make her real.<br /><br />Sabriel is both a perfect intro into high fantasy, and a fresh take on the genre for veteran readers.  The dialogue between the characters is realistic, interesting and engaging especially between Sabriel and Touchstone.  The magic feels natural, and the world large, alive and at times, unforgiving which brings a level of suspense and risk to the story.<br /><br />Whether you like fantasy or not, Sabriel is practically a perfect read and should be a staple of anyone's library.
0345529057|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series even better than the TV series. I have always been a reader more than a watcher and I like the boxed edition.
0345803507|5.0|Good book! I am hooked all tied up in these books....leaves you wanting more. Waiting for the next book...chocolate in hand.
B009F7OQ5Y|4.0|I got this item for my niece, the barbie is very cute, but in the picture it looks nicer than it is in the reality, and the way it is packed made her hair a little bit unattractive
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|Such a great film with great music. As a woman I liked hearing my favorite beatles songs song by girls and I love prettty much all the adaptions. My personal favorite it Because.<br />This album was worth every penny.
B000059TFO|5.0|Bought for my cousin, who had never seen it.  An outstanding movie, which never ceases to move me.  Have we still not learned from the message it so poignantly brings?  Sadly, I think not.
0385347774|3.0|I was disappointed in it as it was too quirky, more of a mind game that a mystery novel.  I probably won't buy more novels from this person.
159463176X|3.0|Hosseini can write very well,  and does,  but this book would have benefited from a genealogy  and a simpler timeline.  He had too much to say and fell into the trap of inventing too many characters to say it.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I absolutely am in love with Grey's Anatomy!!! I can't wait to start a Grey's marathon movie night or weekend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the first game I would actually play anywhere..... I play more than my kids do so it must be a keeper... can't seem to put my kindle down... and just when I thought I knew what I was doing.. something new pops up that I have been missing..  best free game out there to date hands down!!!!!
1250012570|2.0|Based on the reviews I expected a more elaborate plot.  I was disappointed with the ending. I found the book to be an easy read.  It just didn't appeal to me personally.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is simply a lot of fun. It takes just a minute to understand the objective and then your off to defend the planet! Simple fun! Good job!
B009QU9X44|5.0|Love love loved this book. Can't wait for her next offering. Insightful and an easy read. Africans get a hard time but Chimamanda offers us a real look into her country of origin
0307352153|5.0|Sounds extreme that everyone should read this, but it would help our society. Introvert/Extrovert is THE basic personality trait and if everyone understood the two, we'd be better off.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Not recommended for a kindle fire.  It hangs up frequently (can't figure out what trips it) and takes a long time to load any new screen.  Terrible instructions how to play.  Not recommended for a 5-yr. old (at least not mine).
B0006LZPLC|5.0|I was a little worried that they might not fit properly since a lot of the reviews talked about not being true to size. I do not know what that is all about .  I usually wear a size 9 and a size 9 fit perfectly.  I already own a pair of Newport H2 sandals which are very comfortable .  These are a little stiffer and will take longer to break in probably because of being leather instead of nylon but are still very comfortable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun. But I was very disappointed that my first kindle broke and when they sent me a new one(which they did the next day very quick) but all my things I had achieved in the game was gone even though I had it in the cloud.now I have to start all over : (
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game, lots of different challenges so does not become repetitive like some games. Would recommend as something a bit different from the apps out there
B0095GSKDE|4.0|Thought-provoking book that explores uncontrollable factors that enable people to great levels of success.  Easy to read and relate to.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|The ENTIRE CD is good! Every single song. This music appeals to everyone from my mom to my 7 and 17 year old daughters.
B00DB624GS|5.0|I usually don't like to be mean to the ones who don't like this version remastered, but to those who said that the remastering on this is not that great, well you guys are drinking your bathwater. I have owned the original cd version, three different versions of vinyl, and vinyl transfered to cd, and this new remastered edition is awesome, the sound quality is great don't let anyone tell you different. Also the fact that they went to the archives and made the original UK version complete is the biggest plus, underway syncs with one sunny day, and the laughing before Like Crying and not on the end of Fighting for Madge is back. So they put Oh Well in two tracks like the single , except no fade in part 1, so it still sounds like the full version even if the tracks are separate. plus the single of Green Manalishi b/w the beautiful World in Harmony gives this the complete then play on,( even though the latter single was done after the album's release). All I can say is it's about fricken time this back catalouge of FM has proper remastering it has needed. great job, now it's time to release Kiln House ( with Dragonfly/Purple Dancer ), Future Games ( with Trinity and other unreleased stuff) and Bare Trees remastered and released and fast as well as the rest of the Bob Welch era Albums.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Its quite an interesting book; not your typical love story and it has humor and touching real life moments. A good read
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|It was a good and quick read. Most of the time I couldn't put it down. Not so much because its a thriller or so, but because it was easy to relate to the story. The story itself was a bit hyperbolic at times, but overall told the tale of IT transition well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful !!!!  It is fantastic to have such an exact and exciting period piece that is also suitable and recommended to all.
1400069289|5.0|Loved it. Kept my interest. Charles Duhigg did incredible research for this book. It pulls you in from the beginning.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am glad I found this. What an addictive and fun app. I love this game. It is very challenging.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Lots of scholarship but still just an educated guess as to the particulars of the life of the historical Jesus. It appears to me that the legend was -- as it is now -- clever marketing by a dedicated group of followers.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I lived the story told into the late night one Friday evening...I was transformed into the story. I felt the water from the pond as I read each word...such narrative that I felt I was there. I cried with him as Lettie was sent to the ocean and I smiled when I knew she was watching the bow/ man...a must read book if you ever doubt what true friendship means...thank you Neil...
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Disappointing read.  I was told that this would be better but I found it to be a run of the mill jailhouse story.  Kept my interest but not one I would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app gets all A's from me, my kids love it and so do I. If you are reading this review Download now it's fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find it you can create a few secret boards...so that way nobody can follow you .Be sure that you find this useful!!
140006922X|1.0|Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God.  Salvation is through the acceptance of His Holy Crucifixion, most precious blood, and Glorious Resurrection.  Any book that says otherwise is false, a misleading lie.  I would not recommend anyone to read this book.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|they advertise this as a great action movie, but this is a movie for the fiction lovers, really boring and at time simple stupid scenes and story.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I encourage every NCIS fan to get this; it's the best season yet! NCIS is awesome! Buy it today please because you won't be disappointed at all!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|I was looking forward to playing this game as it reminds me of old games like those on my father's Atari. However after downloading I find that it contains a virus which allows it to make purchases using sms messenger. In other words it gets a hold of your secure buying information and then makes purchases unknown to you. This is as if 8:30 on 8/24/13
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|This show is great. Joss Whedon learned his lesson from Firefly and tied the show up in the second season. You will not be left wanting to know what happens. Great show.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this  game is Fun to play to help pass the time. my kids enjoy it just as much as I do.
B00C6B9H46|1.0|movie was not in steel book it came in blank dvd case i collect steelbooks i will be sending it back and leaving you a bad review
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This. Is. Awesome. That is all I really have to say. I love it. I definitely recommend anyone who likes mahjong should definitely play this. :)
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Did not meet my expectation. it did not bring the adapter for the laptop or computer, so felt bad for that.<br /><br />REgards,<br /><br />Domingos henrique<br /><br />+244 222 694 224
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I was so bored, then, I stumbled across this little gem. Great way to pass the time, I strongly suggest you give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Looooooooooooooooooove subway surfers on my kindle. Great time killer and perfect for I.patient kids I would definitely want f2f o recommend this
B009RH9FR6|5.0|My husband loves his new Kindle Fire! The case makes it so easy to watch movies and video, and does a great job of protecting the Kindle as well.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|Their great shoes, but they fit a just a little bit big...I am a size 6 so that's what I ordered. I would suggest for everyone to order their shoe size half a size smaller or buy some non-slip heel pads.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I so hate earbuds if I wear them for any length of time they make my ears hurt.  Plus the sound has always been very hollow without any warmth.<br /><br />Therefore, I was looking for headphones and did not want to spend more on a pair than my iPod cost. These are nice with warm tones and good quality.  I am not going to profess that these headphones are equal to Bose nor will I suggest they are as good since most likely I do to have the ear to know the difference.  However,  I can say if you hate earbuds are are looking for a moderately priced pair of headphones give these a try. Plus they fit over the ears to create a more quiet environment for listening to music.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I very much enjoy this album. Have listened to the whole album over 30 times within the first week of owning it.
B003XME83W|5.0|I love my little Toshiba 10&#34; Notebook, but it's 1GB Ram was woefully inadequate.  Toshiba no longer offers the 2GB and when they did, it was considerable higher in price.  This worked fine.  I would have appreciated instructions, but I went on YouTube and some kind soul had done a video on it and it was easy to do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There is not much more to say other than this is a really good BASIC CALCULATOR always at your fingertips..
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Norton says this app is fine and it would need permission to get out of its VM, which it didn't ask for so chill out. It is fun. Better than the real thing. Got bored quickly...
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book & the professional narration!  The intense moments when the truth comes out left me not being able to put this book down!  I would recommend it!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This is a cast of some of the best veteran actors and actress today. Anyone over 50 should love this movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|So much fun to play. The various levels are helpful but my favorite thing is the FREE bingos you get everyday.  Really helps build your inventory.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really enjoy Vince Flynn's books.  I was so sad to hear he passed away at such a young age.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I really liked it. I see it more then once to make me fill goood. I would recomment it to others.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I tend to not pay attention to battery life and just read, read, read, so the Battery HD is very handy. It's not complicated to understand (a picture says a thousand words!) It's easy to find on the menu and it pops up when I've had it plugged in for awhile to tell me the status of my battery. For a free app, I feel it works as well as any more expensive app.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This has been a total lifesaver.  It charges up my Kindle very quickly, and now I have lost my phone charger, I use it for that too.  I totally love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1469298279|2.0|This is a review of the audio version.  I wanted to like this, but was more disappointed than pleased.  It was an interesting idea and I though Wil Wheaton would do a good job reading.  I was disappointed with Mr. Wheaton's reading.  It sounded like someone reading and not like the natural story telling I usually expect from my audio books.  He didn't even try to do voices for the characters.  Because I was only listening to it, sometimes it was hard for me to tell what was due to bad reading and what was due to bad writing.  Throughout the book it grated on me every time the word &#34;said&#34; was used.  Was it because there was no creativity in describing the conversation or was it because Wil stressed this in an odd way?  While I did like the twist itself, I felt a little let down by the resolution.  I can't say too much about what I didn't like without giving too much away, but I wasn't even clear if the situation was really resolved or continued regardless of the attempt to resolve it.
1451668945|4.0|We had read a significant percentage of this author's booklist when we gave up on the aging M.H. Clark several years ago when it seemed her books were invariably about leading ladies barely surpassed in talents by \\"Wonder Woman\\". Snagging this recent novel on a whim for a vacation, we were pleased to see a complex plot featuring a bunch of characters who were mostly mere mortals like the rest of us! Indeed, a series of incidents spanning 30-40 years were so intricately wound together, the final outcome was both surprising and pleasing, with plenty of suspense sustained throughout the story. Between a homeless man suffering from his service in Viet Nam, and the family he left behind; to an aspiring actress gone missing decades ago; to a family run business burned to the ground, killing an ex-employee and seriously injuring the owner's daughter - and all the characters trying to solve all these cases, the plot gave us plenty to distract and entertain. Only adding to the fun were the budding relationships of the several young professionals near the center of the action, who took on increasing importance as the clues started to zero in on the final outcomes. All in all we were pleased - almost enough to reconsider adding Ms. Clark back to our routine reading list!<br /><br />p.s. -- we have no clue to what the title refers!
B0019IIPZO|5.0|It may be an old(er) movie, but despite one or two moments of fakey lighting, this film is so cool!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Over a year or so it really hold up over time. It eats batteries like crazy but I was expecting that so it doesn't really take away my opinion of them. The sound quality is great the only two things I will say bad about them is that sometimes the headsets router will sometimes interfere with you own wireless internet if you leave it on with out the headset also being on. Then, not very often, there will be pop and tics that happen over the signal that are really annoying but that hasn't really happened a lot.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Entertaining I enjoyed watching withe the family. Everyone enjoyed the show and the action that was in it. I would recommend.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz has been The Man for years and just about anything he comes out with has interesting things to say.  This one is a really NICE one!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie so when I saw the game I just had to try it and I have to say I was not dissapointed. super fun super cute! :-))
B00847KFDS|4.0|this is a nice, slightly different take on his songs ...some work really well and a few are just ok, but all are enjoyable.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites. I'd always give it 5 stars or more if I could!  See it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting, the writing are superb. I really feel as if I'm there in that time frame.  I ended up watching all three seasons in one week. I couldn't stop watching. Hated the ending of season 3 but that just tells you that no one star is really locked in to the series.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|For the reviewers who said this was short,  I think you didn't click through long enough. Definitely worth the money -- lots of play time and different games at every turn.  Not super hard,  but did appreciate the hints. Would give this a 4.5 as there is a glitch or two.  Hope they will make more like this!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this given my experience with other card games because I wasn't sure it would hold up.  I've been playing for a while and still enjoy it.  My only issue is with some of the campaign battles where the opponent has way too many high value cards.
B003ITGPTA|5.0|After all it is a movie, but could be a plausible theory minus all the bullets being shot. No one can dodge that many bullets. all in all I really enjoyed this movie as much as the first one.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I have enjoyed playin the game so far . It was the free app of the day so I gave it a shoot and have not stoped play since
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was very interesting concept, kept my interest all the way till the end!  Will probably check out more books about the silos!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This was a perfect item. I have a camera and was using it for vlogs, but the sound quality was weak. I then bought a Kodak Zi8, which has an external mic outlet. That, combined with this microphone, gets me great audio.
1590171993|4.0|This has been reviewed very ably here so I am not going to re-iterate the story other than to say it is about one man's life and his academic career, set mainly in a Missouri university over the years between the two World Wars.<br /><br />I found the book to be a profound study of stoicism in the face of disappointment. Although it is hard to understand William Stoner's acceptance of the hand life deals him, the author's plain yet evocative prose makes clear that this is rooted in Stoner's somewhat bleak and non-communicative upbringing. However, like another reviewer, I too drew the line at his acquiescence over the upbringing of his daughter. The book is very much of its time. Edith, Stoner's mentally unstable wife, would nowadays be in some form of counselling; she was so painfully in need of professional help.<br /><br />One quote to provide a flavour of the quiet power of this book, as Stoner begins his career as teacher in the same classroom he attended as a student:<br /><br />\\"So Stoner began where he had started, a tall, thin, stooped man in the same room in which he had sat as a tall, thin, stooped boy listening to the words that had led him to where he had come. He never went into that room that he did not glance at the seat he had once occupied, and he was always slightly surprised to discover that he was not there.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please buy,you can build houses and kill zombies and big spiders,skeletons with bowandarrows and green things cald creepers. you collect dirt sand gravel clay wood and a lot of other things. you can create new world's. there are chickens,cows,pigs and sheep that you kill for pig meat,cow meat,chicken and wool.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|This game is not very fun. I got It for free so the is good. Is u like shooting games then u might like it.
B000ENV2PU|5.0|Over the Years there has been quite a few versions of this released. My least favorite is the U.S. Release which also has the lowest track count. This UK release is quite good with extra tracks and the sound quality is fine compared to my Sire Mute lp from Poland which has a different version of Just Cant Get Enough which is my favorite. The music may seem dated to some but I enjoy and play it frequently. I recommend it highly.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really great. It is really fun! Similar to the old version of middle defender. I will be playing this game for hours.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I not sure what I expected from this game, very boring, very boring, not sure what the shark was eating or if I was accomplishing anything
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app performance and usefulness is beyond what I was expecting. It's appearance is sharp and clean. It is the best battery app I have found. The feature I really like the list how long I can expect the battery to last by what I want to use it for (reader, surfing the web, watching videos, etc). I rate it as a must have on any hand held device.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It started out confusing but once I figured it out I love it wish it offered more rooms to escape from
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good, but energy is used up too quickly and objects are very small. Enjoying though.can't wait to see what's in the next rooms I unlock.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Use this everyday whether it is a fishing or work day. Like to check the weather where the grandkids live or wherever we may travel.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Kind of like when KISS loses a memebr to do their own thing and how they still have the feel to their of the sounds of KISS it must be in there Band DNA. I would have to say the same here with Newsted, as coming from Metallica, there is a Great likeness to the classic sounds of Metallica in this album. To me it breaths a touch of freshness into the classic sounds. I like it and am very impressed. AAA+++
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this game Is fun And Addicting. Its Simple In Its Designed And How Plays. This Is A Good Thing For Sure. I Definitely Recommend This Game To Anyone To Pass Time And Keep The Mental Reflexes Sharp. Keep Up The Good Work.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I really was not sure at first what to expect when I had first seen this movie but when it was over I was very impressed. I wasn't sure how it would be without the original cast playing their rolls but showing them as they are maturing in to the USS ENTERPRISE's crew and where they come from and their back stories I was quite surprised. I really enjoyed every minute of the movie and can't wait to see the sequel. AAA+++
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love Eureka I wish it was still on the air!!<br />At least I can watch it on my Kindle
B004O7EVLY|5.0|Very comparable to the group KADAVAR, in the sounds of the 70s. A very rich inspiration from classic bands the likes of Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Hawkwind, Zeppelin, and even Tull. Between Graveyard and Kadavar I just can't get enough, I have been listening to both bands almost every night since I ordered them. AAA+++
0770437400|4.0|I thought this was a pretty great read, especially the first two-thirds. The amount of research that had to have been done on different cultures, traditions, countries, societies, etc. is staggering. It did, unfortunately start to drag towards the end and that's why it dropped to a four star for me. This is absolutely not a blood and guts book, but more an examination of the human condition and our hypothetical reactions to a world wide epidemic. Well done, Max Brooks. Well done.
B000002O3I|4.0|A great CD full of his very best music. The very best of Howlin Wolf one of  the most influential American blues singers.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|This is really just enchanting fairy music. If you are a Cocteau Twins fan then you will love this as it is a compilation, many of their best songs are included on this CD. Highly recommend!
B0016D0YZQ|5.0|I look at this  book as yet another piece of the great health puzzle. Remember: it's details like this that can add considerable years to your health. A great book and one I'll always use as a reference in my own on going health maintenance~!
B0015KO52S|5.0|If you are a fan of Jack White's brilliance then you will love this. The Raconteurs are a great band. The best songs in my opinion are: Many Shades of Black, and Carolina Drama...they are actually two of the best songs ever and they are both on this album so buy it! You will be glad that you did...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 4 yr old grandson enjoys playing the game and is very good at it!<br />I would recommend the game!
B001WCBPCW|5.0|This is a great album. If you are a fan of Kasabian then you will love this, it is well worth purchasing and a great addition to anyone's collection...
072325804X|1.0|Book was too heavy.  My grandchildren couldn't hold it.  Some of the pictures were scary to them.  Should have been done in multiple volumes.  They didn't even want to keep it.  They asked me to take it home.  They love the Beatrix Potter Music boxes and I thought the book would be a good compliment to them.  I was very wrong.  I would not recommend this book.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|This is a brilliant album. It is a classic and if you are into this band you should certainly have it in your collection...most of their best songs on on this album...Where is my Mind is my favorite...highly recommend!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun game to play. There are  many different games try. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes bingo
B000007SPU|5.0|This is a great album one that you will want as part of your collection. This Mortal Coil has their own unique sound with beautiful and haunting lyrics...this album is a little difficult to find anymore so it is well worth buying, you won't be sorry...
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I'm a classic Trek Fan seasons 1 thru 3. As far as special effects etc, etc, I give it a 3. But, this movie is nothing more than a patch work, bait switch, classic Kansas City Shuffle movie plot directing...I wasn't expecting that were you?<br /><br />Great movie for the kids but try explaining what really happen to Pike, Khan? ahhh......don't bother.<br /><br />They should have used James R Kirk. \\"R\\" for Ralph or Rudolph, instead of \\"T\\" It's a 2 rating, signing off...3 or 4 above for the younger viewers.<br /><br />SD 13.13.08
B00005ARDC|5.0|This is a brilliant album. If you are a fan of this band then buy this as you won't want to leave it out of your collection. Highly recommend!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have been a fan for over a year just installed app on my Kindle Fire, works great with no flaws, I highly recommend!!!
B008AVYOBC|5.0|Wow! I did not know this little gem was on the market. I have been a fan of Bananarama since 1982 when I picked up their first 45 \\"remember those\\" I purchased their cds and I always enjoyed watching their videos on MTV.<br /><br />The girls did it their own way with the crazy hair, wild clothes, and their own sassy, punk, take no prisoners attitude! The music videos of Bananarama was the way music was meant to be seen!  They all were Sexy, funny, and a real hoot to watch. They always seemed so happy and had so much fun in their videos.<br /><br />I found some great stuff on You Tube of Keren and Sara playing live in 2012!  I did not know they were still around making new music. They sound really great and look FANTASTIC!!  I wish I could have seen them in Chicago in October 2012. This 30 Years of Bananarama has a cd which contains all of the hits, however the DVD is the reason to buy this item.  There are 35 music videos to watch over and over again.  You start at track 1 and progress through the silly young girls growing into mature classy women! A lot of the videos are of Keren and Sara and the recent songs up to 2009 and they are a real treat!<br /><br />So I want to thank, Keren Woodward, Sara Dalin, Siobhan Fahey, and Jacquie O'Sullivan for your music, charm, and all of the great videos and fun times you gave us to enjoy for 30 years!!<br /><br />I dare anyone to watch this and not be fixed to the screen by the charm of these sweet girls.  And speaking from a mans point of view these 4 girls had it all!!  They were sexy, fun, beautiful, and a real treat for guys to watch. I was always a sucker for Keren Woodward and thought she was so good looking! Check her out in the DVD in her late 40's and on You Tube at 52 years old and she is \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\"  It is hard to believe that the girls from Bananarama are in their 50's now.  Do yourself a favor and buy this now, you will enjoy watching 30 years of Bananarama!
B000P0J09W|5.0|I can never get enough of this movie watched it as a kid growing up and I still watch it, it brings back the memories. Also its a great movie to watch with kids.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly keeps all of my topics of interest nicely organized. I love the smooth UI and speedy response of the app.
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|Good movie loved it, its a great story mainly true facts of his life and absolutely great actors, i dont want to spoil it for you. enjoy it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I would watch it again. Kept you guessing. I did figure it out just before the big reveal. Curse word at the end not needed.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|JOE is one of my favorite artists.  This CD is off the hook!  If you're looking for an original JOE and a CD that is worth your money...get this!  You're going to love this CD!  You'll probably be like me...play it over and over and over.
B00899F0G8|4.0|This was so good! Especially with the Toby twists. I love love love the pretty little liars! Season 3 and 2 are the best in my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|me an my duaghter both love to challange each other<br />its also just fun by yourself to. I would share this game with others.
B001AUKUSG|3.0|not as good as some of his stuff i've listened to over the years,but a good variety of his work
B008MX7Z32|2.0|Easy to use, compact, bright, nice to bring to travel, but too fragile.  Second time I brought on trip, the base connection to the white loop cracked (wasn't from overuse or misuse) so now difficult to position. Still use it, but would have liked the light to be hardier.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|First time I have read a Duncan Whitehead book.  I was surprised at the ending, which I would never have guessed.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I liked it but... Hard to follow all the names, places, dates.  Maybe if I had more bible learning I could have followed it better.
B0098PX68G|5.0|If all the oceans were ink and the heavens a scroll, there still would not be words enough to describe how incredible this movie is.  Benedict Cumberbatch is a superb actor and his talent shines through in this poignant piece of friendship, love, regret, and a life unfulfilled.  The relationships portrayed feel true and unscripted--the laughter is genuine, the tears are earnest.  While some movies use tragedy to appear deep, Third Star has earned its tragic ending.  How many stars would I give it?  All of them.
159463176X|3.0|First half of the novel is compelling.  However, the second half jumps around and the narrative seems disjointed. Too many gaps to be satisfying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this.  very different i would recomend many to play it. challenging but fun at the same time. click download its free.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I put off buying this book but every review kept adding to  my curiosity as to what the hype.  I found the book interesting and full of surprises.  I really enjoyed it and have talked to lots of friends who had the same experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually read fictional stories about things that could never happen. A friend suggested this book and I bought it but let it sit on my kindle for months without even opening it, letting the fictional paranormal romances fill my reading time instead. I was needing something to read while out of town and didn't have Internet access so I started this one. It is by far better than any of the other books I've read...it means something. I loved it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|soo cool especially because I like defense games also it is cool that they finally made this app free for the kindle fire
0385523912|5.0|A well written, easy to read book about life in North Korea.  I enjoyed reading the personal accounts of the people interviewed and how their opinions of their country changed over time.  Easily one of the most engrossing books I've read this year.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is a really great Game.  Just can't stop playing it. I recommend it to everyone. And since I need more words.. that's it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its really fun I've never had a problem with it its super fun and one of my personal favorites it's so easy to use and control the minion
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Really fun game.  Reminded me of he old days playing in an arcade with the old roller ball.  Wish they had touch screen tech back in the day. Graphics run smooth, good level progression of difficulty.<br />:-)
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Don't require comments. Especially don't require lots of words. Just let us rate things. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This is a nice game for my kids ages 5 and 9.  Not too difficult and not too easy.  Great level for both ages.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|As a child of the 70s and 80s, one of my favorite games was Missile Command. This is a great homage to that classic gameplay. Well done, guys!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|my 4 yr old grandson loves this game I always make sure he has access to my kindle  so he can play it
B001MSMULG|5.0|Riveting. Could not put it down.  You will not be disappointed.  Gabriel Allon is compelling and complicated.  Better than John Lecarre!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent read - I couldn't put it down! One of the best books that I have read in a long time - highly recommend. Crazy twist at the end!
B00CIAY9SY|4.0|A well produced, well choreographed, decent kung fu flick. However, the storyline has been overused (White man taunts Asian man. Asian man uses kung fu to beat up White man). Also, the fights between the kung fu masters are &#34;enhanced&#34;, which actually makes the movie seem a bit hokey. Definitely lacks the serious themes and gravitas of Ip Man 1.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game. The graphics are cool and each level gets to be more fun because it gets faster and harder. I highly recommend this game. Five stars!
B0068FYZ84|5.0|It SHOULD have got the best picture.. what a surprise to witness it being nominated as it had NO F--- words or bloody violence! Plenty of action and adventure with heavy laughs and poignant areas of grief. Perfect for sound, picture, CGI/ animation and solid acting!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's so much fun, I wish I got more thing's BUT it's still a great game to play.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very fun and works the brain ans keeps me going. Fun to play while the baby naps and I don't have to be making sounds. Wonderful. Plus its good for some younger ages and my husbands loves to play before we go to bed.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It's an overall great game good graphics and easy enough game playing it's a great way to kill time it's kind of hard not to like sharks especially shark games

B007CF7L9O|5.0|Large, life-like and beautifully crafted. When I gave it to my son for his dinosaur collection, he spent a week in Nirvana carrying it everywhere. It is just something special!<br />Please be aware that Papo, the Carnegie Collection and Schleich all scale their dinosaurs differently so when you buy the dinosaurs, look carefully at it's dimensions to make sure that it fits in with your collection and you don't have a Triceratops that now looks like a mouse.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of this series! Every episode leaves me NEEDING to see the next one ASAP, and the weekly wait really sucks LOL! Love the climax at the end of each episode, very well done!
B0073RBQY2|5.0|This is of a good size, well made, scientifically accurate (as best as I can tell), well painted and quite durable. After a lot of rough landings it will scuff and bits of the basic blue colour will show through. Having said that, it will reiterate that it is durable and will take a heck of a lot of punishment before that happens. A great addition to a collection and the good size of the toy helps your young ones play with it actively as well as learn from it.

1781162646|4.0|. . . . this is what you would get.  Not only an older man looking back through a nostalgic lens at his shy, awkward and lonely, but also strong, ethical and attractive self during his collegiate aged coming of age, in which he loses his virginity to a beautiful older woman seeking solace in their affair from a distinct heartbreak of her own.  And not only a setting in the not-too-distant past that was less complex but no less fraught than our own.  You would also get:  A fair with clowns!  And murder!  And spirits!  Sweet!  For me, these additions are a plus, just as Fraser's addition of an insane clown to his retelling of A Tale of Two Cities to the other patrons of Cheers ramped up their engagement.  The protagonist's heartbreak over his not very lovable college girlfriend is laid on too thick, contributing to an unnecessarily slow start, but once the carney setting takes hold, we are on a joyful ride.  Smart, literary, page-turning, and heartfelt.  I \\"read\\" the audiobook, and it was performed by a \\"young voice.\\"  He was a fine reader, but I think I would have preferred a voice in its 60's, rather than its 20's, matching the \\"looking back\\" perspective of the book.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Just received the chromecast... just a warning... its not ready for iOS users.  Having a challenge getting it up and running and if you use Verizon Fiber, just be warned you need some serious tech smarts.  Still checking different websites trying to figure out what functions I need to disable within my router to make it work via Windows OS.  Also check your TV... need a USB port that is not your SERVICE (NOT) port.  Otherwise you have to use the power adapter and plug it into an outlet... so just be warned/aware that there is a little more than just plugging in the dongle... very hopeful that the iOS App will be out soon and make this a mute issue concerning install... but the power USB note is something that some might find a challenge if you have multiple devices near your TV.
0689835604|1.0|I am so disappointed to say this book arrived and was not in \\"good\\" description as listed.  There is crayon all over the faces of each page, but worst of all the flaps are ALL missing, except one page.  Waste of money, very frustrating.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|I needed a new fun show to start watching and I caught this on tv many times last season. From what i caught I loved it and wanted to start watching it from the beginning. I'm now a major fan of this show. I can't wait for the new season to start back up this fall!
B000056VJ7|5.0|There is not a single song on this album that I don't adore--if I could only listen to one CD for the rest of my life, it would have to be this.
B0052REUW0|5.0|I found this book by the recommendation of Richard Dawkins, and it did not disappoint.  Fascinating, is the best way to describe it.  If you have an interest in the historical processes that have shaped who we are today, then look no further.  Among the many points that really left an impression on me, was how fortunate we are to be living in by far the most peaceful period in history.  The author does a masterful job at walking the reader through the past 10,000 years of violence, noting each milestone of progress that led to an improvement in the quality of life.  From now on whenever someone is pining for &#34;the good ol' days&#34; I will be recommending this book.<br /><br />When was the last time someone cut your nose off at a dinner party?  Things really are getting better!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very well researched, the historical facts add context to the world in which the gospels were written. Thought provoking to say the least.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I love the Cut the Rope games, and this one was great also. Having two different Om Noms to feed was interesting. It was fun to play, but overall it was not as challenging as I might have liked. The kids really enjoy all the different Om Noms.
B0082208XC|1.0|The 5 star reviews must be by the app maker.  The finger tap and sound must be instantaneous for symbols and drums to be played simultaneously.  A fraction of a second lag makes this impossible.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this ALL THE TIME. It's a really fun, relaxing game. The only downside is the minimal pop ups. Also, you cannot change the background. Otherwise, this game is epic!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book was enlightening because it told of the historical Jesus, place actually born and lived and the era involved.  Big difference from the bible.

0064471837|5.0|I originally read this book back when I was a teenager and loved it then. I was able to relate to the novel and felt a great connection to Sabriel. Now, many years later, I still love reading this book (it helped me get through the last part of my Master's dissertation!) and consider it one of my favourite novels (along with the sequel Lirael, which you should definitely read).<br /><br />From the first chapter I was drawn in and wanted to know all about the world, specifically the Old Kingdom. The characters are relate-able and engaging. The story itself is great and the twists and turns cause you to stay up way past bedtime to see what comes next. I genuinely care about the characters and feel that the novel has great depth. There is something really special about this book that has traveled with me through many different stages in my life.<br /><br />As this novel (and the sequels) have prime real-estate on my shelf, I would definitely recommend this novel to young adults and also for adults!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app, it loads quickly and works every time no loading or annoying ads popping up. I recommend this app to anyone that uses calculators on a daily basis
B00CXQL828|5.0|I cannot express into words how great this disc is. I had High expectations going in but they were exceeded big time. We all know the caliber of musicianship here but the songwriting and inspired performances go beyond most supergroup albums. These guys are a BAND and have incredible chemistry. Order this disc TODAY. You won't be disappointed!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game.  My Kindle Fire needs to be charged a lot because I play this for long periods of time. Wow Awesome game.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|The game was free so I bought it. It was easy to play and easier to win. The only issue that I noticed was that once you upgraded one of your skills to level 6 the game lost all sense of challenge.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Great performance by Patrick Stewart. My impression is that he developed a lot through all previous series and reached his full potential here.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I don't think there is anything I can say about this show that hasn't been said before. Downton is the best show out there.  I enjoy every minute of it.
B008IEFJAQ|4.0|The music on this album is great-- Funky [Tickets, Ladykiller], rap-ish [Payphone, Beautiful Goodbye], dance-y [Lucky Strike], but it doesn't really rock out. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the lyrics get old after a while. Are mushy love songs all Adam Levine can write about? Even the least lovey song, Lucky Strike, still sings about his love... just partying with her. Adam, you need to be creative... \\"Surf Wax America\\" by Weezer is a song about surfing. \\"Counting Stars\\" by OneRepublic is about seeing the world. Even though I hate it, at least \\"The Phoenix\\" by Fallout Boy is about a war. Doesn't he ever get tired of writing ONLY love songs?<br />And about the bonus tracks, well, they just sound weird.<br />In conclusion, this is a great album, but Adam Levine needs to show how creative he can be. However the album artwork looks very interesting, that I can say the least. I'd also recommend \\"Hands All Over\\" [M5 album from 2011].
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Great game for anyone who enjoys historical weapons or is just curious about the proper functioning of World War II era guns.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great book from start to finish. A page turner that once you are entrenched  was hard to put down. Truly a pleasure to spend time with.
1451624468|4.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"The purpose of this book is simple.  I want to show how modern science...can address and is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing.  The answers that have been obtained--from...experimental observations, as well as from the theories that underlie much of modern physics--all suggest that getting something is not a problem.  Indeed, something from nothing may have been REQUIRED for the universe to come into being.\\"<br /><br />The above comes from this extremely interesting book by Lawrence Krauss.  He is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the Physics Department at Arizona State University, as well as Co-Director of the Cosmology Initiative and Inaugural Director of the Origins Project.  Krauss is an internationally known theoretical physicist.  He is the recipient of numerous international awards for his prolific research and writing, and is the only physicist to receive awards from all three major U.S. physics societies.<br /><br />As can be deduced from the quote above, this book answers the the following question or \\"theological chestnut:\\"<br /><br />\\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\"<br /><br />So as to properly answer this question, the initial chapters reviews our modern scientific picture of the universe, its history, and its possible future, as well as operational descriptions of what \\"nothing\\" might actually be.<br /><br />It is not until late in the book that all this empirical evidence is put together to answer the question posed above.<br /><br />What Krauss does first is to put this question in a form that science can answer, namely:<br /><br />\\"HOW is there something rather than nothing?\\"<br /><br />Then he defines CLEARLY exactly what \\"nothing\\" is.  (The nothing of empty space is not what most people think of when they think of nothing.  As Krauss tells us, \\"empty space is complicated.\\")<br /><br />Finally, he explains how nothing is something and more important, that nothing is unstable.<br /><br />The last chapter of this book gets away from the physics.  In this chapter, Krauss gives us his thoughts including his thoughts on theology. (Note that throughout this book, there are no big discussions on theology and religion but Krauss does not hesitate to give his thoughts in passing.)<br /><br />I liked the fact that Krauss asks the reader if what he has written \\"proves\\" that our universe arose from nothing?  Krauss states:<br /><br />\\"Of course not.  But it does take us one rather large step closer to the plausibility of such a scenario.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there is one main problem with this book.  It screams out for a glossary.  True, many terms and words are defined or explained in the main narrative but many are not.  Thus, I felt that the lack of a glossary was a major oversight.<br /><br />In conclusion, Richard Dawkins states at the end of his \\"after word\\" for this book that:<br /><br />\\"If 'On the Origin of Species' was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see [this book] as the equivalent from cosmology.\\"<br /><br />It's up to each reader of this book to decide whether Dawkins' statement is correct or not.<br /><br />(first published 2012;  preface;  11 chapters;  epilogue;  main narrative 185 pages;  after word by Richard Dawkins;  index;  about the author)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO.

B000UU4NE4|4.0|This third Spiderman tries to convey some very complex emotions from some very real circumstances. How can a hero understand the mundanities of life that plague his espoused? Beyond his excellence is she even visible? The story handles heavy issues. It is about the pride before the fall and the darkness in us all made manifest to those closest. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />What about the rest of the critics? They are absolutely right. It is at times sappy, at times exuberant, helplessly unnecessary, and comes off as a soap opera due to pacing issues a few times.  But, deep down, this is a story that starts out to tell us a complex and long story. A story they take that builds calmly and beautifully. Sadly, the final leaps of the story suffer from a rushed, clich&eacute;, horribly executed ending that seems forced to say the least.<br /><br />One star for good acting, one star for excellent special effects, one star for complex feelings, one star for Spiderman as an emo jerk.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Maybe I should say missiles away. I find myself tapping away at the barrage coming from above. They&acute;re fast but I manage to hold them at bay. My city goes untouched, but who knows what the next day will bring? A simple game that pulls you in.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|A curious fellow, the doctor is always involved in the affairs of others. Humans have felt his influence throughout time. He saves them, he tries to help them, he tries to improve them. This story, this season, is about his influence on a couple--just a couple--rather than most of humanity. Amy and Rory, two of the Doctor's companions, are swept away in his plots and adventures. They learn much about themselves, and they learn much about the stalwart doctor, who seems happily less morose than David Tennant in his latter days. He is a doctor to enjoy, but to keep a certain distance from. Matt Smith is untouchable, but his companions reach and reach and reach. Nearly perfect, but ultimately flawed, this is a story worth following.
1452115567|3.0|I love the pictures, but I did not get the message that it was a book of pictures only. The prologue or<br />introduction is all that is written; that is well written and extremely interesting, so I wanted more. The<br />pictures are great, but I believe the book would have been better with some commentary about each<br />photo and how it came about. I would have been as interested in the journey as in the pictures.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|this is selena's best album!!!!! i love every song in this album!!!! the mp3 version makes it even better! :) get it! :)
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Decent movie - a little too much going on (too many different story lines, mostly not all fully developed), but overall positive uplifting message.
B005KXU83G|5.0|This one of my first vinyl albums I bought, then on CD and now digital.  The noise of the crowd makes me feel like I am there.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Purchased for my 2.5yo son who loves almost anything with wheels.  He pretty much watches this movie once every 1-2 days (he would watch it everyday or several times daily if I let him); he also loves Finding Nemo.  Story seems a bit advanced for his age, but he is able to sit through most of it w/o complaining.  It is generally ok to watch with some parental guidance - some violence (exploding/ crashing cars), some cuss words/inappropriate phrases (I believe one of the cars said \\"oh lord\\" once; also \\"moron\\", \\"idiot\\", etc), no sexualized images (although a few times mentioned celebrating win with \\"the girls\\".)  Decent purchase overall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game that i reccomend for everyone!!! Fun with so much to see and do this is my second favorite game (behind pokemon) This helps me express my creativity!
1451695187|5.0|Did not have any problems, it did take a couple days longer then I thought it would, which was okay.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game.  The game simlar to the first version from the 1980s.  The update version is very interesting to play.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game has always been one of my fave growing up.... a must have for only free 99 ... lol
0553801473|5.0|Still reading. . . how many more twists can he come up with? Love this series. Can't wait for the next book.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun and simple missile command clone. Miss the trackball. I think blackberry had a phone that had one once. A little to cartoony but i like the distraction.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game . I really am a fan of the minions so this is the best app<br />Yet !! I really love it . And also good luck on your newer projects
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good story line in each show. Live the characters and the underlying drama that goes on...am moving on to season 2. So glad CBS is releasing their shows for this type of viewing because I missed so many during the regular season.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The quality of this is amazing and the story line is amazing. I am looking forward to the sequel that is to come as well as all the new challenges. I hope more will come after the sequel to the room.
B00EFNXPFK|2.0|In music, as in life, there are roads that one must follow, if for nothing else than to see where it leads. But, where one goes, should others follow? That's the question you have to ask yourself about Paradise Valley.<br /><br />Growing up, I had heard the phrase, \\"The Voice of a generation,\\" proclaimed about so many bands. But never did I truly understand the sentiment of that statement. That is, until an up and coming singer-song writer, walked into the lime light and asked all the questions that I, as a young adult, asked myself in those younger days. There he was. With his clever lines and amazing guitar chops, he held me, along with millions of others, captive. Yes, John. I too had a Stupid Mouth, I too asked Georgia, why, and surely, I was bigger than my body gave me credit for.<br /><br />Year after year, album after album, all roads seemed to lead to one shining moment. If it sparked in Room for Squares, it ignited a power keg in Continuum! The mission: Create Blues music with pop sensibilities and make it accessible to the masses. And to his credit, mission accomplished. With Continuum (and Try) under his belt, he had truly made his mark upon the world. But then what? What do you when you reach the top of the mountain?<br /><br />Some would say that celebrity had changed him. Seemingly out of touch with his loyal followers, he put out the less than stellar, Battle Studies. Then came the problems with his vocal chords. After which almost none of the powerful vocals heard during the Trio and Continuum days were ever really heard from again. Retreating from the world into the hills of Montana, he found himself wandering down a winding country road and hidden valleys, whistling to the tune of Born and Raised. Though, I have come to appreciate much of what is on that album, I cannot in clear conscience, say that it I yearn for it, any more than I would yearn for turkey bacon over the real deal.<br /><br />As for the album itself:<br /><br />1. Wildfire is catchy enough when it needs to be and really sets the tone for the rest of the album. Close your eyes and you'll almost swear you were in a saloon, complete with cowboy hats, chaps and player piano.<br />2. Dear Marie is a more somber number, where John reminisces about an Old Love. Not a terribly boring song, but really a song for when you're feeling introspective and want to be alone. Alone, alone alone.<br />3. Waitin' on the Day has the same moodiness of Dear Marie, but listen closely and you could almost swear it's a David Gray song. The guitar solo in this one's worth the listen, for sure.<br />4. Paper Doll drones on a little bit, and if you follow the News at all, it really does sound like he's airing out his pop drama.<br />5. Call me the Breeze. You wanted a Blues song? You got it. Here it is! The trouble is, you want to hear the Trio vocals here, instead you get the neutered version of it. Yea, I said it.<br />6. Who you love. You wanted an almost Blues song? You got it! Complete with unnecessary guest vocals. Katy Perry hatefest aside, she just doesn't have the strong gritty vocals that would have made this song Continuum worthy. In a live preview, he teased us with a great guitar solo that he decided wasn't necessary. Instead, we are treated with Katy Perry giggling. Just as good. Oh yea, if you took a shot for how ever many times they say \\"who you love\\" in this song, you'd be dead.<br />7. I Will Be Found sounds very juvenile in writing and composition. You can do better than this, John. \\"Birdy in a big ol' tree...\\" Really?<br />8. Wildfire...what?<br />9. You're no one till someone lets you down. Looks like John made a bunch of somebodies out of all of us. I kid! This is as country as it gets, folks. Not what I signed up for. But feel free.<br />10. Badge and Gun. No. Just no. I don't...huh?<br />11. On the Way Home isn't anything special either. It's forgettable in the way that most of these songs are.<br /><br />And here's the trouble. He was the real deal, people. A Blues man through and through, hanging out in the company of greats like Clapton, B.B. King and Buddy Guy. They welcomed him with open arms, brought him into the fold, and in return he has defecated on that bond, and is now content to bring you what many have described so elegantly as background music.<br /><br />But, I still love you, John. Cut it out.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love the game I play it often . I recommend it to people who like puzzles and strategy games it is creepy
B001BANK32|2.0|The Shining employs too much naturalism, indulgent description, authorial intrusion and more typos than a spam e-mail.  And it is so BORING, good Lord.  Who ever said this book was scary?<br /><br />It would be rejected for publication if written today.  And rightly so.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love the game just wish I could also play offline. That would earn the game five stars, . Otherwise awesome game
B0027Z5DM6|1.0|Not even worth the fifty cents it cost me to rent! The movie is very predictable - a guy is able to skip parts of his life he doesn't like, so pretty soon he's skipping everything, then the remote begins skipping things for him, and in the end everything goes back to the way it was. The movie even uses the ridiculous cop-out of \\"it was all a dream\\" near the end. The moral (to spend time with your family instead of working) is nothing that hasn't been seen in hundreds of other movies. I rented this because it was marked as a comedy, but it is nowhere near that, unless your definition of comedy includes dogs repeatedly humping a stuffed duck and little kids cussing. There's also plenty of sexism and objectification of women - for crying out loud, in one scene the main character talks about how \\"chesty\\" his daughter is. He kicks his ex's husband in the crotch, farts in his boss's face, and belittles his children. This is supposed to be funny? Don't waste your time.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's much smaller than I expected. But, does a nice job great for a backpacker. Would probably not use with fine cutlery (as in fancy), but why would I?  This one s all about portability.  Recommend caution on using the &#34;pick&#34; -pulling from the tip feels lie its going to snap. Grabbing the middle is a little tricky, but feels less brittle.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is lots of fun! I really enjoy this. It reminds me of games from the 80s. Would recommend this game to others.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Overall the story in this is simplistic and somewhat weak but the performances from the actors and special effects bring it all to life in spectacular fashion. Looking at it in that light I'm reminded of James Cameron's Avatar. Still, It was entertaining from start to finish.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like all three books in the trilogy but I did not like the ending.  Stretched it out into three books, then ended rather abruptly.  I like the suspense of the x boss trying to get even.  Of course, there was lots of sex!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Does bring back memories, but with the push screen it's a lot more responsive and easier than the old joystick.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to read book two after the ending in book one.  It was the best of the books in my opinion.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I very much appreciated the album. There are some very danceable tracks, like &#34;Get Lucky&#34; and &#34;Give Life Back To Music,&#34; but my favorites are the more thoughtful songs &#34;Instant Crush&#34; and &#34;Within.&#34;
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am enjoying having the bible at my fingertips on my Kindle Fire from Amazon.  It is coming in handy as a reference for me.  Thanks for providing it for free.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I have some vinyl records that I've been dragging around with me for over 30 years, so I was not sure how the quality would turn out once converted to MP3s. This turntable works great. The sound quality was far better than expected. The only issue I had was that the software is a little buggy, and I have to restart it after every album for it to work properly. That being said, it imports the songs to iTunes and it's pretty easy to use. Overall I'm happy about this purchase and I'm almost done converting all my ancient albums to digital.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I did enjoy this book and could not wait to ready book two and book three. I loved having it on my Kindle Fire.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thought this was great read. Drags at points but catches up later in book. Great Grisham book! Good read for  summer.
B009WUBERW|2.0|While watching this movie, I lost interest in it and started playing Candy Crush Saga on my phone. I'm not a hard person to please when it comes to movies but this one is not a movie I will watch again.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|Entertaining, fast moving film. JJA films always lack any subtleness or depth and this is no different. I think the continued deviation from the original ST story line is a mistake.  All that said, I was entertained for a couple of hours which is what this type of film is supposed to do.<br /><br />My big complaint was with the streaming video quality. I did not see the film in the theater so I don't have any thing to compare to. To much of the video seemed to be viewed through a fog or underwater - not the crispness and clean edges I expect from HD. Incidents of ghosting, halos, and pixelation seemed unusually high.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I can watch this movie over over and over again. Thor is one of my most loved movies in the world, second to The Hunger Games.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the ease of the integration between my phone, laptop, and iPad. Ordering books has been pretty much seamless every time. The only &#34;flaw&#34; would probably be the absence of page numbers (but I can understand that with this format, that may not be possible).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoy this app and have recommended it to friends. I only hope that sometime in the near future there will be the addition of an audio book option.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I will watch this movie everyday. I fell in love with all 3 books so I had to see the movie when it came out.
B00821PCJS|5.0|After Walking Dead, i have not yet seen a better series! Falling Skies has amazing plot along with amazing Character development. I recommend this series to anyone! I was skeptical at first and now am enjoying Falling Skies every-night after work!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|We have children that live in different States and friends that live in different countries. A zipcode and a swipe and I have a quick easy update.<br />Thepuddles2@yahoo
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Froze my Kindle fire, had a ton of trouble logging in, content that should be accessible took forever to load. The Dolphin browser works a million times better.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I purchased this with my coins and it never downloaded, I want my coins back so I can buy one that will download.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I'm still trying to build my Castle, but the quests are fun! I like the music/Sound FX too, quite enchanting!
0786958731|5.0|Fun, fast, and easy to learn.  Components are sturdy and look great.  Considering the size of the game and the variety of play options it is a steal for the price.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Needs about 100 more levels, but a really fun challenging strategy game! If you like the &#34;Dash&#34; games you'll get a kick out of this.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game has stages where you find you're holding your breath. Plus they give you points if you review. Not a bad game...it makes waiting in line go by.
B001R1PZ9M|2.0|I remembered being younger and hating this movie... Tried to watch it 10 years later and made it about 15 minutes... its just boring, the first 2 are great... thats my opinion of course..
B00DZP3KJ0|2.0|Good book-- If you like Kelby's stupid and dopey humor, you will like this book even more than the others. Someone needs to tell this guy that he isn't a comedian. His technical stuff is good, but I am so very tired of his writing style I probably will not purchase another book by him.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its awsome I love it its fun. fun it is cool awesome extra cool and extra awesome I love it.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is my favorite comedy sci-if tv show, very entertaining,  All of the characters have gone onto other tv series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Is soooooooooooooooooooo legitimately awesome , I never thought the Percy Jackson series would be interesting until I actually read them and now I am a geek and nerd.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is an ok game. Pretty good graphics and would be great if you needed to kill some time. So if it's free get it!!
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|I liked this movie but it was too long and boring. I don't recommend it. The scenery is good but the story is boring.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Most useful for inexperienced users. Most of what it does you could do yourself. But this puts it all in one place with no having to dig through settings. Nice app....I would recommend for Kindle users.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. Wished it would have lasted longer. Hopefully the sequel will last much longer. Would definitely recommend this game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|the best rpg have played on my kindle fire! we need more games like this! the campaign is great so far! and combat is good too! :)
B008JFUO36|1.0|I apologize but find it necessary to comment on a film which will probably gross 4 hundred million dollars or more in &#34;its &#34; lifetime. I promise not to give any plot give aways but just read some Bradbury or Ellison and you are almost There. This film was more  than 120 minutes of computer generated  entertainment and I will.probably never think about it again as there are better films and tv shows with similar concepts.  The locations were wisely chosen but with many graphics added to show the decay of war. Many film lovers like to go back and THINK about the film from time to time . Not all great films need that all important message but please let our minds run a little wild with imagination from time to time after viewing a block buster with a fine cast and new visions of the future. Think about a film such as SILENT RUNNING. You saw the near future with a cast of three humans  and two robots. We were given an actual view of the importance of inter species relationships.Humankind to nature.We saw and hopefully still think how reckless we have been  with land development and its long term impact on OUR planet. A film may leave us with hope and compassion such as ET. Its a classic .Much simpler sets .Its greatness is in the fantasy left for the audience to dream and wonder.  In Oblivian its not there.This film is just another clone of somone elses images of a possible future.Oblivion does not churn any new thoughts for me which has not been shown before in other forms. As I stated earlier its just 2 hours of entertainment and its gone. Please do not misuderstand me . Some films are just that ,pure entertainment. When it comes to the sci fi genre Im hoping for more. Lets rattle the cages ,stir up strong feeling we have for a brighter future or how to prevent global catastrophe. I did not get a whisper from this film . I watched this film three times wondering when am I going to get it (didnt finish round three and just gave up. No loss to the producers though . Much money and time spent with possibly a great $ return. Why not it is Mr. excitement himself. He just missed this time . Please show me what I have missed. Is this a film from a graphic novel that was  just too subtle for me to get all the physical metaphors ? Truly, I know many films are a disappointment when you expect more of whatever. Grossing the national debt on a film that did not provide much in.entertainment or lacked  a thought provoking idea in anyway is sad.Especially when there is much to that we can think about if presented differently. Stop here the rest is a spoiler  IF YOU LIKE THE PLOT (FROM READING THE OTHER REVIEWS) THEN I SUGGEST THE FILM &#34;MOON&#34; . IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF CLONING . Is memory also retained in the genetic composition of the newly cloned cell? If it is then an individual never really dies. All that he/she was is still there and will be there in all future generations of that genome. Its a type of rebirth or reincarnation of the human essence.  Moon is a more personal film. Oblivion is an actioner that depends so heavily on graphics to create the atmosphere . In Moon the character(s) really pull you in to their dilemma.  The computer generated graphics are no where near that of Oblivion but relies more on character development to feel the pain or shock of human replication for economic advantages. The CONCEPT is so deep and thought provoking that simple sets work just as well. Its not about what you see on a screen but with what thoughts you leave the theater or your set at home.There is a concept here that certainly deserves some thought.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great logic thinking game. Fun trying to figure a way out of each room.  The difficulty level was not too easy which made it more fun.
0143034901|1.0|This book starts off slow and only gets worse.  I picked it up about 6 months ago and suffered through the first 100 pages and just couldn't handle anymore.  I have a little OCD about finishing books I've started (It took me about 2 months to read War in Peace in Junior High) so last week I picked it up again and decided I'd just grit my teeth and bear through it.  What an incredible waste of time.  Normally when I'm done with a book I donate it to the library but this one is going right into the recycling bin.  I don't want anyone to have to suffer like I did.
B0015KO52S|5.0|A great alt rock album. Jack White gets most of the credit, but all band members come together wonderfully. Would definitely recommend.
1594204217|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!  Now I need to get my own copy!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a super fun game download it<br />Stupid fun I couldn't ask for A better gamers like this lol please download and enjoy Ruiz wonderful game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great read, thought provoking too.  Really enjoyed this book.  Reads quickly...  I was done in a couple days.  But the story stayed with me.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I found this app very fun , easy , and cool. Cuz you can talk to your friends and make new friends . Overall very nice app. Talk to me on kik @ PineappleMwuah
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show with light presentation of some pretty intricate topics.  each show leaves you smiling, and has a nice complete ending, though you cant wait to see the next one!  great series!  one of my favorites!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been playing this and bakery on my iPhone for over a year, now I also play on my tablet! Best games ever!! Add me on both I'D Li2ard and KindleLi2ard
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I am not one who likes to have things on a device without knowing what and where.  This app lets you see your folders and locate documents, photos, and downloads you may have side-loaded without having to use a USB connection to search via your computer.  My only complaint to-date is the new update has brought up a box with the message, \\"this app is not an official app for this device\\".  However there is a box to check to not see this message again, which I have done.  The app, however, still seems to work perfectly.  Maybe the next update will solve the issue.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|First time I tried this author... Also my first time I read a book from someone from those latitudes<br /><br />It is a nice story, well written, about life and family... Enjoy it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game.  There is no real skill, just tap where you want to drop a coin and hope for the best.  I guess when I play it, there is no thinking, no stress, very brain numbing.  It can become addictive if you let it, so easy does it and be patient for your next 40 coins.  So when you just want to space out for a bit, this game lets you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! It's so easy to use. I hate a calculator that the biggest problems are figuring out how to use it. Two things I like the best is the running total and the back x button.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I just downloaded this game, but I'm already addicted! I love it! Even better deal that I got it free.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, I was not all that impressed, even after seeing a couple of trailers.  The reason for this is because of the so-called horror movies that have come out in recent years, namely The Haunting in Connecticut.<br /><br />Well I was WRONG when I saw this movie!  And I'm glad I was.  Not only is The Conjuring incredibly creepy (and a true story), but it's not scary because of special effects; there were barely any used.  The actors were incredible.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren were spot on.  I really also liked that this movie was basically told from their perspective of what they did for people living in haunted houses.  I was reminded of The Amityville Horror (the original, not the remake) because the events in The Conjuring took place in the 1970s and the director thankfully didn't try to modernize that like they did with Haunting in Connecticut.<br /><br />The other actors, Lili Taylor especially were very convincing!  I have always liked her as an actress and I'm glad that she finally got to play a different type of character than she usually does in movies/TV.<br /><br />What I especially enjoyed about this movies was the music.  It was just creepy.  And when you expected something to appear or happen because of music cues...it didn't.  That just made it even scarier.  There were times when I was sure something was going to happen...and then we move to the next scene.  Very well done horror movie and I was really impressed that the classic horror movie was brought back here.  I really hope that filmmakers continue to do this when they make another horror/thriller.<br /><br />Just one tip: don't watch it alone in the dark!
B0016BP0PW|4.0|This is a light-hearted application of songs I've grown up hearing.<br />So much fun!! I enjoyed seeing the songs 'come to life' throughout this<br />dvd.
098478280X|5.0|this is one of the best code interview book with questions and guidelines set aside right for interviewers and people seeking internship at reputable companies.
B005ANZN3Q|5.0|Liszt and Lang Lang, there's never been a better relationship. If you have never listened to Liszt then this is the best introduction to the world of Liszt and Lang Lang.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game is fun and can get hectic. Works great on my GS3. Would buy even though I got it for free.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good read. Wanted to know the outcomes, but got tired of the repetitiveness of it. Liked the epilogue!  Thanks
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Very rambling narrative that was difficult to follow. I have not been able to finish reading this book. At some point, I will complete the book.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was just wondering what happens when she scream every time she comes?  I keep thinking about all the reasons that happens.<br /><br />I was kind of sucked into this story after a while.  But my favorite character is the bodyguard who buys all of those devastatingly beautiful clothes time and time.  I wonder if he can eyeball less than perfect figures and still come up with a perfect wardrobe.<br /><br />And let's face it, the stuff comes in as a character all its own.<br /><br />Could you imagine this story set in a trailer park.  Definitely would not be much fun.  That orgasmic screaming would probably get them a police call.  And after the kids comes, child protective services might be interested in mom hanging on a branch to get spanked.<br /><br />See, the rich are different from you and me.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I tried this game but I have other bubble popping games that were much more fun.  The bubbles were so small.  I deleted it after I played it a couple of times.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I loved this book! Although at some parts things were a bit confusing with the way they were described. I will definitely read the next books in the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an awsome game.  It's challenging and yet not so tough that you give up.  I LOVE the bright colors too.
0399159347|5.0|I loved the writing and the way that the author wove the characters together. Her story development and surprises throughout made for one heck of an entertaining read. So glad to have found this author, and especially this book. She is one to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I highly recommend this game. It is different each time you play, and it is a fun challenging game. It never gets old.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Written in a unique style. Different perspective on World War  Two and the holocaust. Captivating. Best book I've read in awhile.
B000P0J09M|1.0|i started watching the DVD, and 3 times now it plays to one hour and a few odd minutes and stops, cutting to the starting screen...It will NOT play in the movie's entirety.  i finally got the case it arrived in and in small letters on the back bottom of the case, stamped over other stuff are the words &#34;disc made in mexico&#34; so apparently i purchased a boot leg DVD, i don't know.  all I know is that i bought a DVD from Amazon no less and it's mess up and made in mexico.  so i'm totally disgusted and angry.  thanks Amazon.  yes, i'm being snarky!!!!
B00004TWZF|5.0|This is a French classic, the best movie ever. If you haven't seen it please do! You'll want to buy it also!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this series.  Watched all three seasons in a few days... I couldn't get enough.  You won't be disappointed.
B008AS5UAO|1.0|The CD set is superb (5 stars!) but stay away from the MP3 edition. Whoever made the transfer must have been pressured for time because the final seconds of many tracks are cut off, what's sometimes called \\"audio dropout.\\" Same is true for the newly released COSI FAN TUTTE by the same forces. VERY ANNOYING. I have ALWAYS admired the quality control behind Amazon's products and services, but their Cloud Player service will be in trouble unless they devote more time to recording quality. If you want an MP3 copy of this recording or the new COSI, buy the CD edition and upload it to Cloud Player yourself.<br />[[ASIN:B00973CHWA Mozart: Don Giovanni [+digital booklet]]]  [[ASIN:B00EF2KKGI Mozart: Cos&igrave; fan tutte [+digital booklet]]]
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck definitely nailed this movie.  His acting was first rate and the movie was also first rate.  I started watching it and was captivated from the first moment.  I have since watched it several times and would encourage anyone who has not seen it yet to view it.  It is that good.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I only bought this CD for 1 song, and the version on the cd is way different. I also listened to a few seconds of every song and they all kinda sound the same, slowish with haunting music. ive never heard of this artist before, nor am I a fan but Im sure her fans love her albums reguardless.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have to wait another year for the release of the next book. I do not think Martin can sum up the story in 1000 pages so there will probably be even another painful wait to find out what happens in Westeros. Sigh. Serious withdrawals.
B00ENIR864|1.0|This app doesn't work for Kindle device even though it shows it as compatible.  I have tried opening this app several times including loading, deleting and re-installing.  Amazon should remove this from the app store as a compatible Kindle app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a good quality game. Worth every cent. I played the arcade version, this is way better and more interesting.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Goo clean mindless fun. Only issue is that it asked me to rate it in exchange for in game points.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|My 9 year old daughter wants to be an Ornithologist, so we bought her this &#34;bird movie.&#34;  I was surprised by the fabulous cast, because I really had not heard about this movie when it was on the screen.  What a GREAT movie!  We watch it over and over again.  I guess it must be too intelligent for the average movie viewer.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is loads of fun. It keeps me busy when I have nothing else to do. Its worth it
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone girl is a very good thriller full of twists and cliff-hangers. You never know what will be the next surprise and certainly do not expect what will happen! Brilliant!
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Love them.  Hate them.  No matter what you think of the band, the documentary is super entertaining as they follow their long career.  Great watch!
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|I am a sucker for music documentaries and books even if I am not all that into the artist or the music. This documentary about the studio where many seminal 70's and 80's California rock album were recorded is a little lacklustre, or maybe that is just a reflection of the state of the place.<br />Once Dave Grohl and his fellow film makers have convinced you that this is an historically important place, the studio goes belly up, the long term staff lose their jobs and their benefits and Dave Grohl (charming but clueless) buys the famous console and moves it to his home studio. After that the film becomes a promo for Studio 606 and even though the footage is really cool, it leaves you cold instead of inspired.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome, great puzzles!!!  Whoever came up with this was thinking.  It requires a desire to follow leads and chase clues.
B0002HZHXG|5.0|Purchased this to go on one of the Bruder trucks we bought for our grandson.  Can't remember which truck, but the scale is the same is the series of trucks that they make, so it was perfect.  Bruder has great quality for plastic toys.  The details is excellent, and my grandson hasn't broken anything on any of the trucks we've given him.  This is a nice addition.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very good script, each chapter has excellent stories. The staff of actors and actresses is luxurious. Good closed caption and image quality. The series each season keeps an increasing rate in the narrative.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game. It plays well with better graphics than the arcade version I played as a kid. The ability to repair and upgrade defenses makes its even more fun. I recommend this app.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great cultural history of the Vikings. Very good production, besides the staff of actors and actricies. The script very well articulated, has the rawness and wildness of Viking culture. Good action scenes and harsh reality of the time.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This was an interesting book, but could have been covered in about 25 pages, but was very helpful.  Worth reading.
B008MA83HC|5.0|Excellent selection, very good songs and arrangements, plus lots of songs. Great band, they are the best of rock latinamerican music
0752860887|5.0|Book exactly as described.  Lightly used, good condition.  Quick delivery.  Bought it to read to my grandchildren.  There's a CD that goes with the book, but I already had the CD and only wanted the book to go with it.  Thanks
B003OCWF6I|5.0|im glad that i got this. this was exactly what i wanted. great condition and blu-ray for a decent price!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game from the 80s that I used to play by this is way more better &amp; fun. Will be playing this game lots of time.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My only complaint is that this game is ONLY 44 levels.  I loved the game, and the challenges that it was, but I cannot wait for either a sequel or some extra levels!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I cannot find it on my kindle fire. I have done a search on my tablet, on the cloud, with a file cabinet app, it is not there.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. The relationship between the two characters is more realistic than any book I've ever read.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Glad I got this as FAOTD.  A lot of possibility for enjoyment; however, with no time limit, no penalties for excessive hits, and unlimited hints, a lot excitement potential is lost.  When I first downloaded this game, it would take forever to move between chapters.  In fact, I started to play another game on another device while I waited!  Thankfully that problem seems to have been resolved.  With some chapters I feel like I am dropped in the middle of the ocean with no idea of what to do.  I just start tapping to find something to give ma an idea.  Right now in chapter 14, I need to find a key.  I have been hitting around for over 5 minutes, and cannot discover its location.  Good story line, graphs, and dialog,though it can be a little long winded.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I really enjoyed the fifth season and the sixth season. now looking to continue my Gilmore collection looking for 6th season.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The interaction between the characters is so believable.  Excellent story lines. The show is well done in every way.  Thanks!
B00499NHLC|4.0|Plots are pretty good.  A little hard to follow.  Need to get use to the accent of all the characters.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have played this  everyday since I first found it in the app store! It is a fun way to pass some down time. I would like to find more game collectibles in my treasure chests though...Hint hint...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing & intriguing! Flip-flopping narrative about a housewife's sudden disappearance and all that led up to it. Plot twists will have you hanging on the edge of your seat!
B00005LELD|5.0|The 50mm really doesn't need this hood but its great protection for the front of the lens. This fits well as you expect from Nikon with metal threads so it goes on secure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a cool game I love it cuz I'm in love with horses I have 2 miniature horses of my own Poptart and Rudder
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game my kids hate because I can't put it down. I wish that the energy didn't go so fast though. Love the puzzles and the scenes
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's addictive and easy once you get past the first level. Zombie and shout out to make it is awesome
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Values, morals, and worthiness abound in this film. This was exciting, romantic, funny, and poignant. There was action and danger as well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Play it every day.  I would recommend this game to everyone. The only bingo game I play.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Its a really good movie with a good story too this movie is worth watching over and over again 1000 times.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|It won't start on my kindle. I have nothing but trouble try to put it on for security. I'm still not covered.
B004VPAXHU|4.0|Good value and delivered on time.  Will definitely consider purchasing from this source again.  Good to be able to listen to this music once more having lost the original LP
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is sooooo much fun. I could literally sit and play it for hours if I wasn't writing this review.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I am new to Sudoku and am now completely hooked on this game. A great version for beginners, I love the note taking feature.
B00BR5KBU6|5.0|I normally don't like/finish books with themes related to cruelty, nor do I normally listen to audio books (this was my first), and I admit I was tempted to abandon it after a few sections, but it grew on me more and more as I listened. It is such a bizarre mix of cruelty, despair, and struggle mixed with comedy that it is almost Shakespearean. This is one of those books that makes one realize how different societies can be, and how easily people can be oppressed to the point of hopelessness. It was a fascinating read, not for the timid, but the author really knows how to develop a story, and the characters were fascinating. I have been reading prize-winning books that span the years from 2000 to present, and this one, unlike a number of others, really did deserve the Pulitzer in my view. It is a very unusual novel, well worth reading.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There is a growing number of scholars who are finally placing the life of Jesus in its historical context rather than distorting the historical context to fit their own belief system.  This is a must read for every thinking Christian.
161655164X|5.0|This is a must have for the fans of TLOU.<br />The art is amazing and detailed. You see the effort and all the work behind the design and conception of the game, every enemy, character and detailed in the game.<br />As this is part of the collector's edition, sold separately is a very good option to have it.<br /><br />Fully recommended.
B0053O89JM|1.0|So now i can't watch all the disc. i am on hold til i receive the other disc. And since i ordered it ahead of time as a birthday present for my son we can't return it because its past the returning date. We have all the seasons he just needed season 8 and he is really disappointed. I am disappointed, what can i do?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice little Missile Command clone with upgrades. Gets tough after the first few levels. Definitely worth getting while it's free.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a good game. Very easy to play. Simple graphics...very old school it brings back the nostalgic feel. Maybe future updates would include different cityscape and backgrounds.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good upgrade from the old game from the old days. If you remember it and liked it then I would recommend this one.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Playing on Toshiba Thrive.  I like this game.  Controls are challenging, but I am able to get a couple of kills per mission , so it is fun.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Great book, thank you for teaching me about North Korea. I wish I can help some how that truth come out about this poor country.
1250029465|5.0|This book only recently came to the U.S. - formerly it had been on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a year (700,000 copies) after its initial 3/12 appearance. At one bookstore appearance, over 200 lined up to get signed copies.<br /><br />London street musician and 'author' (actually ghost-written) James Bowen met Bob in 2007 - things weren't going well for either of them at the time. Bob was a stray orange male cat with patchy fur, an abscess on one of his legs, and in need of lots of TLC and some good meals. James was living five flights up in a threadbare flat w/o a stove (had a microwave) and furniture that clearly had long histories behind each piece. He'd become involved with drugs (was recovering at the time), contracted hepatitis, been homeless, and suffered from loneliness.<br /><br />After making certain that Bob didn't belong to the person whose entryway he sat outside, James carried him home, treated his wound as best he could, and fed him. After a few days of seeing Bob's wound wasn't going away on its own, James took him to the vet, bought the prescribed medications, and also acquired recommended cat food - emptying his entire savings. By then James had also realized that Bob must have become used to living outdoors - he refused to use his litter box, and James had to take him outside. Bob loved it when James pet him, slept next to James, but often woke James up scrounging for food in the kitchen. Bob did, however, heed the word 'No.' Bob also often liked to watch TV.<br /><br />Another problem - Bob often seemingly went bonkers, racing around the apartment, climbing up James, etc. James recognized this behavior as indicative of Bob needing to be neutered. James obtained a certificate from the vet allowing this to be done w/o charge, and took Bob in. Behavior improved considerably, but some wildness still remained. James then tried leaving Bob out during the day while he went off to play music - Bob would be waiting when James returned. Then he started to follow James, and James had to carry Bob around on his shoulder for Bob's safety. (Bob would also walk part of the way on a shoestring leash.)<br /><br />Bob's presence while James played made an immediate difference. Far more people donated coins, and many wanted to stop and talk while petting Bob. As Bob's story spread, some even traveled for hours just to see him. (Bob's even met Paul McCartney.) Passers-by and neighbors knitted sweaters for Bob and brought him treats - he know has one in about every color and pattern. His tricks - giving high-fives, escaping when he wants out, has his own bus pass, and sometimes uses the toilet.<br /><br />Interesting aside - James relayed how the presence of a CCTV camera dissuaded several young thugs from becoming violent, as well as how he'd been advised by others to place himself near such cameras for just that purpose.<br /><br />Now more than 100,000 follow the two on Facebook and Twitter.

B000002KET|5.0|By 1973, Black Sabbath had started to mature their sound. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) also reflects the increasing interest of Tony Iommi in incorporating aspects of progressive rock into the overall sound. Although I prefer the rawness and unbridled power of albums like Black Sabbath (1970) and Paranoid (1970), Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is truly an excellent album that shows the increasing attention to detail and arrangement that the group was putting into their albums. It also demonstrates that they wanted to move beyond the first two albums - in fact, this was a source of tension between lead singer Ozzy Osbourne and guitarist Tony Iommi that culminated in Ozzy being dismissed in 1979.<br /><br />The arrangements on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath range from a simple acoustic guitar piece (accompanied by none other than Rick Wakeman [of Yes] on acoustic piano) to more sophisticated tracks like Spiral Architect that feature strings.  Other tracks feature synthesizers (mostly mini-moog) - the use of different tone colors is what really separates the mid-late 1970s recordings from the earlier music.  Of course, the album is dominated by the \\"classic\\" Black Sabbath sound including Ozzy's distinctive vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played at a crushing volume that are, at times, de-tuned a bit below a normal tuning. There is also the bulldozer-like rhythm section of drummer Bill Ward and Geezer Butler; Geezer is a fantastic bass player and his approach on this album is more of an ensemble player. This stands in contrast with his wild, virtuoso playing on the first two albums.<br /><br />The sound quality of this CD reissue is just OK - I would love to see this properly remastered though.  The album cover art is pretty cool - it shows somebody being alternately tormented by demons and consoled by angels on his death bed -trust me, the effect of the record cover was a lot more pronounced. The CD liner notes are pretty skimpy and include the track listing, some of the personnel involved in the recording process, and a little blurb on the history of Black Sabbath.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic album by one of the most creative heavy metal groups that shows them developing their sound further. The sound of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath would receive further treatment and refinement on the excellent follow-up album Sabotage (1975), which is also highly recommended.nnel involved in the recording process, and a little blurb on the history of Black Sabbath.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic album by one of the most creative heavy metal groups that shows them developing their sound further.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very good game if you like Missile Command. I think this is a very good edition making it actually possible to reach higher levels.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is definitely a series to &#34;binge&#34; on.  I can't stop watching it.  There are always unanticipated twists and turns.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I love the series, and I love having it in blue ray, but having the disks in a booklet that does not secure them get's irritating any time I pick up the case wrong and things start falling out of sleeves. I really wish the disks had been better packaged.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Man, I see this thing has a good amount of negative reviews.<br /><br />This can be a great sharpening tool for you depending on your intentions.<br />I keep attached to my cheap, Coldsteel Roachbelly knife that I use for fishing.<br /><br />I have no intention of taking the time to sharpen and or hone my edge with stones<br />and strops while I'm out fishing.  I just want to run my knife through a guided sharpener<br />for a couple passes and get back to work.  This sharpener serves that purpose, perfectly<br />and I have absolutely no complaints.<br /><br />I wouldn't use it on my more expensive knives, or my knives that have a vastly different<br />degree on the angle of the edge.<br /><br />I wouldn't rely on it to sharpen all my knives either.<br /><br />I recommend using this on your cheaper knives, and furthermore that you exclusively sharpen these knives on this sharpener.<br /><br />I've never actually used the rod, so I can't tell ya anything about that.<br /><br />This is a cheap, non specific guided sharpener, and should be used on cheaper knives<br />in situations like mine (where you don't have time to sharpen.<br /><br />I wouldn't expecting hair popping sharpness either, but cleanly going through paper is well within its limit.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game it is a lot of fun. I like feeding the horse it is annoying about the energy level.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Interesting stories that help round out Bosch's world.  The backstory about Cielo Azul brings together several lines from his history.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really loved this book it taught you about ways to get through high school like the way charlie did but at the end I didn't know what aunt Helen did
1554512115|5.0|Who doesn't love this story? Robert Munsch is the best! This is a great board book for babies and toddlers.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Hard to put down once you start getting the hang of it. Levels get harder but with upgrades with your points you will succeed
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I wish I know what know now when Steve Jobs was alive. He is a fascinating character. This book is an easy read and a must for any Apple fan, business person or someone that inspires to be great.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've read the entire series so far and I read these for fun.  These are my &#34;junk food&#34; books.  I have to admit, I do wonder what is going to happen with Sookie and at the very end of the book I did moan and say &#34;not again&#34; but all's well that ends well.  It seems I have one more to read, I'm looking forward to it after I finish my current read.  Who doesn't like vampires, werewolves, elves, ghouls, witches and all around bad guys?
B0029LB2V4|5.0|This was a great season I love watching these types of shows. The way that the characters were portrayed to the actual story is amazing.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I learned so much about how memories work and how habits affect our lives.  It is a well written book that you do not need a Phd to read.  The writing moves a long quickly and I found the use of cornerstone habits has changed my life.  I added exercise to my schedule and found so many aspects of my life changing for the better, just as the books said.  Even if you don't want to change, the knowledge of how our habits affect us is incredibly useful.  If you are dealing with someone who has memory loss from disease or age this is also a good book to start with as you learn more about your particular situation.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Between 24/7's Mahjong and card game Android apps, no one can touch their quality of graphics and stable game play on my Galaxy SII and Note 10.1. If I was looking for an app that would be for-sure great fun for hours, get this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is wonderful.  My daughter read it first.  It was recommended to us by my third grade daughter's teacher for my sixth grader to read.  My sixth grader loved the book so much that I read it.  I've recommended this book to everyone who will listen to me.  It is heartfelt, beautiful, real, sad and uplifting all at the same time.  I cried when Hazel was in the hospital for many reasons, I cried for the other characters challenges and losses but I also smiled at how human they all were and how they dealt with their lot in life.  Great story.  It also made me want to go to Amsterdam in the spring - read it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's really fun. Brings back memories of the classical missile defense, but I really like how it is set up and the gameplay.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Watched this with my husband.  He saw the movie in the theater and wanted me to see this movie before we see the next Star Trek movie.  It was great fun to watch and I love the Spock heavy plot.  We've watched the original TV series, some of the newer series and other Star Trek movies.  I feel this beats the older movies hands down.  The plot seemed stronger to me and I liked the character development.  I think many classic Star Trek fans also felt this was a great movie.  I'm now looking forward to the next movie in this generation.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game and somewhat addictive. Reminds me a lot of the original with a touch of modern. Lots of fun.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I picked this book up because I was in a store flipping through it and was intrigued by the photos.  However, I wanted to order this in a kindle version.  Having done so, both I and my daughter have read and enjoyed the book.  Great fantasy time travel story.  Courageous children and a fast moving story.  I also enjoy the strong female characters.
014312093X|5.0|John Le Carre, whose career was in the spy business, is a master of this genre.  Tinker, Tailor tells several stories which are woven together brilliantly.  There is terrific suspense, the book is impossible to put down, and Le Carre's writing is sublime.  I'd tell the reader the plot because it's so exciting......and complex.....but I can't take away from the reader all the wonders of this book.  It's a marvel!
B000OVLINI|3.0|The story did not, for me, live up to the promise of the writing  he uses metaphors better than any writer I have ever read, but I never really cared about any of the characters.  I also got lost in the plot.  As writing: brilliant. As a novel overall: only fair.
1400032717|5.0|Excellent read if you're interested in autism and its many manifestations.  Well written, some humor, a mystery, and always the boy hero who is brilliant in his own way.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Bought 2 cases. One from sprint for my husband and one on amazon for me (I wanted pink and sprint doesn't carry it). Both of ours starting falling apart at the same time. 3 months of use is all we got. We both loved our cases at first. I recommended them to everyone. Swimming under water while videotaping was pretty neat. The top right corner on the front of mine is falling apart which caused the seal to break. I do tend to put pressure on this part with my finger while typing. This may have caused it. But for $70 it should be a little stronger in my opinion. But this case has saved my phone from breaking. I dropped it pretty hard and the only damage was to the case.<br />Now my husbands seal broke on the back of phone where the camera eye is located. It seems as though the glue is just not holding anymore. Unfortunately he did not know until he took it to the river and took pictures under water. The water got into the phone. Although his phone did dry out and works, the camera no longer will. Not sure why but it is stuck in the closed position. Enjoyed them while they lasted, but would not buy again at that price!!!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie more than I expected.  However, I couldn't decide if I was offended or amused by the underlying theme regarding how women treat men.  A pretty negative portrayal of women, but it was a different take for a movie
B003AVPV1O|5.0|All I have to do is adjust the monitor resolution down a couple clicks so the TV can display as a monitor, start my streaming of the shows on Hulu, Netflix, Crackle, etc, select RGB-PC mode on TV, select full screen, then I turn the monitor off, and I've got movies on TV! When done, I minimize everything, turn monitor on, put the resolution back, change TV mode back to regular! A very inexpensive solution to use your PC for TV then back to the monitor!! You'll need an extra monitor cable for your RGB-TV connection if you don't already have one.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Thought I would have trouble getting into this book - all the Russian names etc. however after the first chapter , as with all Jeffrey Archer's books, I could not put it down.  Thrilling - kept you wanting more  - a great read.<br />My only concern now is which Jeffrey Archer do I read next !
B0042RUMIW|5.0|One of the best live performance DVds I have ever seen!! sting is amazing and the orchestra was icing on the cake.  Jo Lawry is incredible too!  the best song on here was  their version of Whenever I Call Your Name.  Brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|Omg I am an emotional wreck after reading this book! I love Will he is so passionate and strong. Lake really grows up in the book also! I absolutely loved it :) highly recommend it
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I just love the program thanks it works great and is free, videos play on it, and it stores bookmarks
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I loved Ender Wiggin in the &#34;Ender's Game&#34; novel.  But, he doesn't seem to be the same person.  Of course, after 3000 years, there would be some maturity.  This Ender, though, shows through only when he speaks for the dead.  Then, you see the uncompromising passionate Ender.  However, you would think that after 3000 years, he would have had time to get over the guilt.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it! I definitely could become addicted to this game.  I only wish there were more levels.  Most excellent game!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I guess I'm old enough to remember when this game was in arcades.I  like the update.  Runs smoothly and the upgrades feature is nice.  Only 4 stars because even with the updates,  this band is fun,  but it gets repetitive really fast. It gets progressively harder,  and it is fun to challenge yourself to see if you can get further or get more points,  but there is only so much that will get you in terms of repeated game play. I imagine I'll play this for a week or two and then I will uninstall when I grow tired of it.
B003XYE7R2|3.0|Yep Holmes is still an ass and Watson's hero worship is annoying. However the plot was better than previous Holmes books, the mystery more mysterious, and a decided lack of Holmes until the end! As seems to be common for Sherlock Holmes stories and also my reading of Agatha Christie mysteries, everything was wrapped up quickly and neatly with a staged trap and a long detailed \\"explanation\\" by the detective. In this case Holmes to his confused sidekick Watson.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I dont mind for a short while but then you have to switch the sounds every few min or you can go nuts but its neat app
B008DVJO8C|1.0|whispering is not singing. Lack of passion, emotion, and feeling leaves you with constipated-esque squeals and whispers that put you to sleep. the only reason i bought it was because the other three were awesome i will listen to the next one before i buy it. The instruments are uncreative, monotonous, and the band just sounds like they want no part in the project. Can you say sex appeal? No member mattered but Maria on the album advertisements. and whats up with all the 5 stars!!!????????????????
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Good action movie, a little overboard with the slow motion and gore.  Not a very thoughtful movie, but good action.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|the freedi youtube thingy app one has a virus in it so I got this one an it works great!
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have the free app plus the $15 key, my question is, can.  Use this app as an organizer planner to do list?? I don't use ms office apps, as i have no need for a document reviewer. But i do need a to do list. And a journal dairy app. If i can not use this app for my needs,then, can anyone recommend a cheap but good app for my kindle fire? Thank u!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Excellent design and quality. I recommend it. meets my expectations. quality at a good price well designed Good, Good, Good
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun little game with a classic theme.  Could be a bit faster moving after each level but otherwise cool to play.  Easy start with enough build points to get some good improvements.
B005N09L5C|3.0|The movie was very dark and depressing.  I read the book in high school but I remembered enough to be able to follow and understand the movie.  Without having read the book I think it would be a very difficult movie to understand Orwell's contempt for communism.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! This book was really, really wonderful. I read it in like, two vacation days. Such a real look at life and death and hope and cancer. Loved the heady verbal plays, even if they seemed a little too mature for the characters. Still utterly delightful and one of the best parts of the book. Don't miss this book, not a waste of time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|What the tittle said, this game is fun to play and exactly like it's predecessors. Over all I liked the game and will continue to play it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best app ever......our so at least I think it is. I usually have to try several different of the same apps before I find the one that I actually like but with this one all it took was one download and I was hooked. I would get it if I were you and besides it's free!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Invokes memories of Missile Commander!  If you played Missile Commander on the Atari growing up, I am sure you will enjoy this game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's good but it is way to hard to get repair points. But all and all I like finally. Not as good a hello kitty carnival though lol.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have always loved mythology. This novel was not a disappointment. Although I like Percy being in the spotlight for some reason. Worth the buy.

0345803485|2.0|This book depicts a depraved sexual relationship between a man and a women. The heroine is an immature, childish, somewhat vulgar, young woman who &#34;falls in love&#34; with a man because of his good looks.  The man is a shallow,  self-centered sadist. Almost all of the book is spent describing the sex between them. At first, curiosity kept me reading, but the writing level was mediocre at best, and the repetitive sexual descriptions soon became boring.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Despicable Me was great fun and I cannot wait to see Despicable Me 2.  The minions have captivated everyone and will be a Halloween costume hit.
0753541637|4.0|&#34;Lean in&#34; is well worth reading. I particularly liked it because it touched on many of the feelings I have struggled with as a woman for a long time.  I am not alone!<br />  What was lacking, however (I thought) was a guide for women which would be acceptable, but be quite different than that of men. After all, no one likes &#34;bossy women!&#34; Women, in contrast to men, could be leaders  while still retaining  their feminine characteristics: qualities of caring,  sensitivity and nurturing.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app says this is an old version but the update link takes you to the google app store which the kindle won't let you use
B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|This is a collection of some of the most beautiful music from the Baroque Era.  Corelli is an amazing composer and in this collection you will see why!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Perfect for girls of all ages. So AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Really cool. I would highly reccomend it to anyone.Please get it. It is cool.
1401938906|5.0|Like someone else said in their review, \\"Pam Grout is my new favorite author.\\"  Pam believes the way I did as a child and for years after that, until I got so tired of being told that I thought differently than anyone else.  Well, it feels good to know that my gut instincts weren't wrong!  I feel LIGHTER already, and haven't finished it yet.  I couldn't wait to encourage other people to get this wonderful knowledge and feeling!  At least try the ebook because it's only $1.99 --- you can't go wrong!  Enjoy!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|All of Kate Morton's novels are superb! This one is no exception. I so enjoyed it. Well worth the time and effort!
1451673442|5.0|Next to THE POWER by the same author, this book changed my life more than anything else.  You can go day by day in order (28 days) or skip around to fill your immediate needs.  My mold allergy that mimics bronchitis (and the cough cracks my ribs!) is now under control.  Not only did it help me heal, but it put me in the right place to hear something that should've been obvious that helped an incredible amount.  It has changed how I feel about everything.  I was always afraid to acknowledge something was good, because it would immediately go away.  Didn't approach things with true gratitude, just fearfulness.  I try to get everyone I know to read this and THE POWER.  1st The Power, then The Magic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you can get past all the zombie (or walker) killings, this is a great study on what people might do should we experience an apocalyptic disease or world war III or who knows what!
B003ZHR6SY|5.0|Excellent movie, fun. Excellent seller, perfect quality, i do recommend, seller and movie. just dont let the kids handle the disc, they will breAk it as mine did with th previous one
B000AMPZGC|4.0|As you hear the music, you can imagine the film in your head and the music is perfect for Halloween or even to hear pretty but terrifying music.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|exactly what you expect. it is classic missile defender with a modern look. the features work well and it will not disappoint
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I'm the biggest Harry Potter fan in the world and I love this movie. If you are a fan buy it, it's perfect for your video collection.
B00846REIS|2.0|I was hopeful when I started this book, but ended up disappointed. The plot was almost non-existent. Some of the characters had potential but the glimpses that were shown never amounted to anything. The whole book was about the sex scenes and waiting for something to happen. I usually read an entire series when I start something but I don't think I'll read any more of this one.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have enjoyed Mahjong on the computer. Now I have it to go. I only wish I could make the tiles bigger. This is harder than it is on the computer, lots of symbols. Still a fun gamet keep your mind busy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The app is a GREAT way to spend your free time. It's also SUPER addicting! I really recommend this app!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator and works great. It's large and takes up the whole screen, which is nice actually. Simply a great app to use!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game. Not very complex but fun and addicting. Nice to get it is a free download. Worth 99 cents though.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is actually pretty fun!!! Its addicting tho i dont think i would pay for it( it was the free app of the day)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app I can wake up to my favorite song and know what the temp is when I wake up in the morring
B0025KW29U|5.0|Here's something that in no way should work: a musical superhero comedy focused on a villain protagonist's vlog that actually has elements of a tragedy . It's such an eclectic idea that it shouldn't work nearly as well as it does. Yet, Whedon and the cast pull it off beautifully. The humor is great, offering plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the humor never fully distracts from the great characterization brought into it. Our three protagonists blend well together, each representing a stance of morality and the complexities related to it.<br />The music is worth noting as well. Though the orchestration isn't the best sounding (one must keep in mind that this is a low budget, self funded project), the end result produces some beautiful musical numbers rivaling some fully funded productions.<br />The Blu-Ray also contains Commentary: The Musical, a meta musical that makes fun of the performers and the production as a whole, and brings a whole new experience to the film itself.<br />Overall, this film is great. It's weird, it's odd, but the end result is something that's so great that it leaves you wanting more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm enjoying this application even though I'm in my 20s.  Give it a shot and see if it's worth your time. Who says girls ever outgrow horses!
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|Note: This review is for those using the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I don't yet know how it works with the other versions of the Kindle.<br /><br />Just when I was about to buy the first one. The second one wasn't available for for Kindle Fire HD yet, they add it to the Amazon Appstore. How lucky am I? Getting it on the first day, and being the first to review it. So far the game is almost perfect. A few minor issues here and there, but nothing major. Right of the bat the game force closed (FC) on me when I opened it. I thought it wouldn't work. I gave it another shot and would you look at that, it worked. (The FC must have been something unrelated to the game.) The game has a very short, but informative tutorial right when you start. I have yet to get far in the game so I will update this review if needed. Here are some PRO's &amp; CON's.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />+ 3D Graphics are great.<br />+ Tutorial is Short, Sweet, and To the point.<br />+ Gameplay is smooth as silk.<br />+ Has a nice Multiplayer.<br />+ Uses Amazon GameCircle. (More games should use this.)<br />+ Good variety of customization.<br /><br />CON's:<br />- Unresponsive on occasions (If you touch the screen while it's on a loading screen).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The game is nearly perfect. It's well worth the $2.99 price tag. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the game became unresponsive when I accidentally touched the screen while it was loading more then once (won't force close but it comes up with a message saying that it is not responding and asks if you want to wait or force close it). If you just click wait it will continue without any problems. That's just a minor bug that I'm sure will be fixed in a future update. The game is pretty new so you can expect a glitch/bug here and there. If you guys are looking to buy it, my suggestion is go for it. Thumbs up on the buy. You won't be disappointed. Hope this helps and thanks for reading.
0316223239|5.0|This is an amazing, intense, and engrossing book.  It is narrated entirely by an intelligent, complex five-year-old boy named Jack.  I stand in awe of how well this is handled, how well the reader comes to understand the situation in an adult context, despite no breaks in the narrator's persona.  Characterization is complex - characters have realistic goodness and flaws.  It is the story of a mother and son whose lives are restricted to an 11'x11' room, about how the mother creates a secure, complex, and lively environment within these limited dimensions.  I don't want this description to be a spoiler, because part of the experience of the book is how the reader grows with this mother and son.  It is a painful book to read; it is a testimony to the strength, dedication, ingenuity and determination of motherhood.  It also can be seen as a metaphor for the difficult but more common lives many mothers and their children endure.  This is a must read book, but it is painful and, at times, terrifying.  If you do read it, stick with it, because the last third rewards you.  It was a NYT Best Book of the Year, and was on the shortlist for the Man Booker Prize.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was totally engrossed in this game. If you ever played Myst and enjoyed it, you will enjoy The Room. The graphics are extremely well done and you get the feeling that you are truly there. The hint button was helpful in time of need . I liked the fact that you only got small hints, just enough to help and not enough to make it to easy. Can't wait for more rooms to be created, I'm totally hooked.
1400052181|5.0|This is a non-fiction book centering on a line of malignant cells grown from a cervical adenocarcinoma removed from Henrietta Lacks, and the story behind them.  The cells continued to multiply in culture media instead of dying off as happened with all other human cell cultures.  The book tells of Henrietta's shortened life, that of her family especially her daughter Deborah, and the experience of the author as she gathered information for the book.  The book is engrossing, due both to the subject and to Skloot's reporting and narrative skills.  It is also an enlightening look at the evolution of medical ethics and the problems it faces in today's world.  This is a book you won't want to put down.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|What's great about this, as well as other music by Pat Metheny is that I find it uplifting, creative, contemporary without being advante garde or disjointed. As a novice guitar player I can really appreciate Pat's incredible talent as a guitar player and composer, as well as the musicianship of his band.  For me, listening closely to this music is almost like a religious experience.
0061537969|4.0|The narrator of the book is a dog!  His master is a would-be race car driver, and the racing motif, especially racing in the rain, is carried throughout.  Stein is a gifted storyteller.  The book is highly engaging, has good plot tension, and is a fast and satisfying read.  It has a strong sense of humanity and warmth.  There's just enough characterization to avoid sentimentality.  The main male character's flaws make him seem like a real person.  There's just enough homespun wisdom to give the story depth.  It's a book you'll want to keep on your bookshelf.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is my second Seiko Kinetic. Looks nice, &#34;casual&#34; appearance with out looking like a generic digitial or one of those clunky-looking wannabe &#34;diving watch&#34; style watches that are out there. I've had many Seiko's and they are all but bullet-proof. I've never had to replace one because it quit working or because I broke it - only because I got bored and wanted a new one (one of mine I wore 10+ years).<br /><br />The movement is quite accurate, however as a kinetic, it will only keep time a couple of days if you don't wear it daily. I just flip it a couple of times, set the time and throw it on and it's good to go. If you have several watches that you rotate through, you may want to buy one of the winder stations...
0307744434|3.0|I'd give the first 450 pages 2 stars, maybe 3 at best.  The last 60 pages I'd give a 3.  The book is surrealistic, and highly imaginative.  It is the story of a magical circus told in short vignettes, but in the last 60 pages the reader is given a glimpse of explanation.  If highly imaginative imagery appeals to you as a reader, you're in clover, for that is the dominant positive characteristic.  The plot is enigmatic and quite complex.  There is minimal characterization.  My biggest problem is that the reader is kept way too much in the dark.  The boundary between reality and magic is so vague that the reader has difficulty orienting himself throughout the book.  The plot is equally puzzling.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good multi-sharpener for the price. I have one in tool box at home, one the in truck, one in the tackle box, one in my desk at work, etc...
0486290492|4.0|This is all young marriageable women, their relatives, friends, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc., and their beaux, potential beaux, scoundrels.  There are complex plot twists, broken hearts, infatuations, true loves, illnesses, and lots and lots of manners/customs.  There is wealth, lost wealth, and the struggle to make the best of dwindling fortunes.  There are villages, countryside, mansions, cottages, and London.  And many flouncy skirts.  This was Jane Austen's first novel.  It is quite wordy, and more densely so than Pride and Prejudice.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|With the lives of three whales on the line, and the whole nation watching, you can't help but hope the best will come. When so many people, of different backgrounds come together because of these three whales, it shows how powerful the magic of the love of animals can be. As it is based on a true story, it just makes it so much more special. I definitely had some tears, happy and sad. You would have to be a stone not to find a place in your heart for this movie and the story behind it. I would definitely recommend it and would even say it's a repeat viewer.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I stopped reading this book 2/3 of the way through.  Not sure why Amazon recommended it to me, but it was not for me.  After reading a series of great novels this summer (The Interestings, The Normals, & Sons), this paled in comparison. Wasn't worth the time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had seen the movie before I read the book so I had characters and stories in mind as I read it. While at first i disliked it changes, I actually ended up liking the book way better than the movie. As usual its much more intriguing to read all the characters inner thoughts and descriptions rather than see them on screen. This is a great story and it deserves to be read over and over again.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is simple and functional. It keeps your attention and gets harder. No glitches found yet. It's a good app of the day.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|Bought for an anniversary present for my husband. He LOVES it! Couldn't ask for anything more (except maybe a man cave for him to watch it in as much as he does ;) ).
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Honestly, whats the difference between the Blu Ray Watchmen Ultimate Cut boxed set, and the other Blu Ray Ultimate Cut with the graphic novel...other than the fact that has a copy of the graphic novel. The set with the graphic novel is much much cheaper than the other set without the graphic novel? The descriptions show a different Aspect Ratio for each, but there is no proof that the aspect ratios were ever different. Not even WB states that they were different. They are priced dramatically different. Can anyone help clarifying this up?
1423140605|5.0|This book is amazing. It kept me hypnotized in it. I laughed and cried. It has a lot of action and it makes you say what happened every second and you never expect what the answer is!!! Theres more love dovey stuff which is awesome and twists in the relationships of the seven demigods. Cant wait for the next one!<br /><br />Me encanto el libro y no hay nada mas que decir xD
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reliving my childhood. So much fun.  Fun, colorful graphics and a great feeling of nostalgia. Enjoyed it for hours and hours.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Wish you could get more repair points at the different levels. Can be very annoying at times and i'm not a big fan of that at all.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|First time I've seen a movie with Julianne Hough.  Before watching, wasn't sure I'd like her acting but she was good in this one.  Actually all actors were good.  Movie was suspenseful and romantic.  Loved the scenery.  I think women and men would like this but probably more women than men.
B000001GAM|5.0|I have no idea whether or not this is the best recorded Bruckner Ninth -- it's not a symphony one listens to lightly, and I don't have much experience with it.  But on its own terms, this is tremendously impressive, and I'm inclined to agree with the reviewer who suggested that it's hard to imagine what Bruckner could have done for a final movement that would have rounded all this off credibly.  Guilini was working at a very high level at this point in his career, doing some of that work in Los Angeles (see the great box set of the LAPO performances).  This one is from Vienna, a record of a live concert with the VPO, and the sound is as a result not quite as refined as the LA sound, but it's pretty darned impressive.  The symphony seems to me to be \\"about\\" the fear of disintegration, suggested throughout the long first movement in the way that all the thematic material seems edgy or over-assertive (VPO brass terrific throughout!) -- nothing settles, and much seems to be being tried out for stable development, but it never comes, and in the second movement we hear the disintegration -- the timpani and the lower instruments are just brutal (this is how music says noise and chaos), and Guilini just gives it to us straight: it's a kind of assault and leaves you wrung out.  The last movement I see as trying to put the pieces back together, starting usually with lyrical string figures reminiscent of similar moments in the first movement, but more developed and pursued more persistently, even though at times the threat of disintegration looms again.  Right up to near the end of this 30-minute long movement, it's not clear whether beauty or ugliness will win out, and Bruckner somehow conjures out of high strings and winds that had been irritatingly dissonant something approaching beauty in the final bars.  The whole thing is quite amazing.  As my comments suggest, I see the piece in narrative terms -- maybe the only way a musically illiterate person can see it -- and Guilini sets forth that narrative very lucidly to me.  It's not a comfortable narrative, though, and might have the effect similar to, say, a powerful performance of \\"Lear.\\"  I need to hear other versions, but not anytime soon.i sets forth that narrative very lucidly to me.

B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was kind of a boring book. My favorite was book 6. I will probably not read the 8th book because they are starting to get boring, and it makes me feel like he's only making books for the money. I was more interested in the first books. It was a good book, but it was very boring during most of it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Acting, story, suspense...it is all there. I would recommend this to anyone and am looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I loved reading this book.  It was a well written story about a very unlikely Journey with very likely people
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has the mindset of temple run but the fun of despicable me.Fun for all ages.and the biggest bonus its free
B005V1WYZC|5.0|This movie was really well done. I was quite pleased with the acting and flow of the plot. Funny and sad and touching all at once. Gosling is one of my very favorite actors and shines. Carell and Moore did a great job too.
1454704225|5.0|This book is what I have been wanting.  The work of the featured artists is fun and inspiring.  My favorite is the work of Flora Chang.
B008220DGE|5.0|Love the actors in this movie. Every one did an excellent job. I found the plot tight and the movie flowed well. Characters were well developed. All in all a great movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragon vale is amazing.  it is so awesome that a lot of games have copied it. you will love this game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was entranced by this movie. It was beautiful and well done. Acting was great. Story was so touching. Makes one think.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am very glad that the book was written by a doctor, Maybe more people will believe there is more to life. My mother was operated years ago from hysterectomy. We didn't have a TV in our house during the 1950's. She had an O F B experience and no one really believed it.  She told me about it But, when I mention it to my sibling they didn't really believe me since I was younger and the older ones were at school. It was a lovely experience for my Mother. I saw Dr. Alexander on the Dr. Oz show It was explain in a way that other people and Doctors could understand. Some people will still doubt it but, that's OK. Thanks Great Job. My Mom wasn't going crazy.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I had fun playing this when the family got together for Christmas.  But I don't play it at all now.  Next time we get together I'll try it again.
B000MMN6YS|2.0|If you are looking to improve the video because you like the movie on a DVD you already own, don't waste your money
1451626096|4.0|I am enjoying this story - but I am not loving it as I had hoped to.<br />The characters are not really very likeable so far (I haven't finished it yet)<br />and I love the tudor period - Henry VII was a favorite of mine at school so I<br />REALLY thought I would like him as a character - but not yet, maybe he improves later in the novel?<br /><br />Good but not great.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This is a great clean family movie for your athletic kiddos to watch and the parents not mind sitting through it!
B004W4N55C|5.0|Perhaps  a bit pricey; however, having easy access to the world's largest tab database and extremely functional tools (e.g. the tuner) is an outstanding resource. Also, I am using this app on my kindle fire hd 7 inch, and I have had no issues with this app's performance (e.g. freezing, crashing) whatsoever. Bottom line: a very solid app.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I loved the whole story line. The cast was perfect! The storyline, especially at the end was awesome!! Buy this! Watch it over and over
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Okay with the new. I like having easy access to the weather and its free!! Love being able to see multiple places and have them saved.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots fun. I really like it and I love minions. So yeah it's really fun. You should really play at it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had mine for about 9 months now, sound is excellent, battery life is very long (use it for about 8-12 hours every day, charge it at night).  Ordering another one for home.  Update:  There is definitely some wear and tear that comes after over a year of use, I also tend to drop it and trip over the charging cord knocking it to the ground.  I don't believe there is another headset on the market that comes close to this.  It's comfortable to wear (rectangle ear cups are far superior to circular in my opinion), the sound quality is perfect, and the battery life is more than acceptable, and wireless gaming headsets just don't seem to be commonplace, at least for this sort of price.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book brings a wonderful experience and understanding about how we can truly live in the moment and trust that we can attract anything into our lives!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little USB charger seems to be very well made. It feels solid and fits securely into the 12v socket in my car's dashboard. This is in contrast to some cheaply made 12 volt automotive accessories whose plugs fit so loose and sloppy that they are constantly vibrating loose and have to be repeatedly pushed back in to the socket.<br /><br />Both sockets deliver at least enough power to charge my Samsung Galaxy Player (a 4&#34; screen device).  I don't yet own a 7&#34; or 10&#34; tablet to test if the Anker charger can deliver enough juice to charge those larger, more power-hungry devices.  I will update this review if/when I have a tablet to test on this charger. I also don't own any Apple devices so I can't test if the Apple-specific upper port is delivering Apple-specific electric power (&#34;I-juice&#34; I suppose you would call this).<br /><br />The Anker charger got only slightly warm to the touch while powering my 4&#34; Galaxy player. If I get a chance to test it with a 10&#34; tablet I will be sure to check it for heat build up and report that in my update.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2015. Product has now been in use for 23 months, trouble free. I would buy another one if I needed a second one.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is a stellar movie with great action, great acting, and very artistic directing. I just watched it streaming but would love to see it in HD. I am sure it would be even more mind blowing in 3D. It is dark, gritty, and not stop action. The special effects are well done and fit nicely. It is so much better than Stallone, not that that takes much.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Downloaded this game for free and it is a fun, addicting game. It is definitely worth the regular price for it.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I love the fact you can rotate the Kindle and stand it up horizontally or vertically, great for reading an online newspaper in portrait mode, or watching videos in landscape mode. Case is thick, but feels very durable and protective.
B00479SVBU|5.0|My daughter bought this for me as a Father's Day gift at my suggestion.  Putting all my music on a solid state memory device to play in my car renders the CD/CD Player, with all its moving parts obsolete.  The sound quality is pretty good. However,the majority of the MP3 files I have on the Soundfly thumb drive were ripped at 320 Kbps.<br /><br />I did encounter one odd quirk.  It appears the Soundfly doesn't like SanDisk thumb drives.  I tried (2) 2 GB, (1) 16 GB and (1) 32 GB SanDisk thumb drives of different styles and they all had to be removed and reinserted after starting my car, before they would play. They were all different style thumb drives.  I tried (2) 2 GB Verbatim, (1) 16 GB Kingston and (1) 32 GB Kingston drive with no problems.  Soundfly Customer Service advised me to reformat the thumb drive and make sure I had nothing but music files on the thumb drive.  I tried reformatting the SanDisk drives as directed (FAT32) and made sure to select each of the directories I wanted rather than using a select all option.  I could not see any other files on the SanDisk drives and the files copied to the drives that worked were the exact same group of files that didn't work on the SanDisk drives.  Maybe they have some files hard coded onto their drives that don't going away in the formatting process.  Unfortunately, it cost me a few doubloons to buy the thumb drives to find this out.  Anyway, everything is working fine and I really like this little device.  BTW, the Customer Service was 5 Star.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't normally write reviews because I figure, \\"who the heck am I to review the work of these gifted folks?\\" The answer, and the whole point of these reviews, is that I am one of the targets of the author, one of the people that must be set into this world that has been so brilliantly crafted, therefore my (and every) review is everything to the author.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has crafted one of the most incredible stories, as my title says, \\"Twisted, Ingenious, Perfect.\\" What a place must be the interior of Hugh's mind! Sir, you have succeeded to immerse me in your horrible world of silo's, to the point of really creeping me out! You have manipulated my emotions like a puppet master, and in my opinion this is what good authors do. Mr. Howey, you are the best because you have me and my emotions dancing a jig!<br /><br />Let me just say, if you haven't read this book, do it now! You will be blown away! Hurry and read this so you can read \\"Dust\\", the conclusion of the series. I am, again in Howey's dark world and loving it.<br /><br />Thank you for your amazing gift and for sharing it with us,  A Stunned and very Happy Reader
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|This is a fantastic film about life's decisions and how easy or hard it can be to make decisions. The characters are believably real and the acting is beyond measure. This was enjoyable to watch and it touched many emotions while watching. I can only hope that more films like this will surface.<br /><br />It's not the typical \\"orphans find a home\\" film which makes this one of the great films. It is an out of the ordinary look into a short span of life of one young man who is raised as an orphan. He then strikes out to see some of the world he has only read or heard about while trying to find his own place in the world. Along the way, he finds new characters with new problems and sees old problems in a new way.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|So far it works flawlessly. The controls are very easy to use.  Almost better than the original arcade game in my opinion.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|when I tried to download. it for the 2nd time it said string not found and would log off and even. if it Did get to the pony page it would log off fix it asap text this number wants it is fixed 321 710 2756.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|It kept you interested all the way through and showed a different side of Lincoln that isn't in the history books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I got bored if the immaturity of the characters and the exaggerated sex stuff. It was made for teenagers, although I would not want my teenage girl to read that bad taste stuff.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter plays this game and loves it. she enjoys the activities she can do with her horse. I love it because its beautiful to look at. we enjoy it together.
B000025Y9I|4.0|Arrived in good shape.  Too bad this singer did not make it big in the United States.  He is great.  Glad I could find it through Amazon.
0486284735|4.0|Jane Austen has long been one of my favorite authors and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is by far my favorite among her books. This is a classic and timeless tale of romance and the often-ridiculous social mores that too often control people's lives. The love affairs between Jane and Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have entranced readers through the decades. I gave a 4 rating (instead of a 5) only because in today's fast-paced society, used to the instant gratification of TV and videos, Jane Austen's elaborate and descriptive writing style might be difficult for some people to stick with. For those of us who love the grandeur of the English language, that will never be a problem.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A wonderful game. I especially enjoyed the games within games. The variety of things to do makes the game exciting.
1455523550|3.0|I fell in love with Nicholas Sparks as an author with some of his earlier books (\\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle\\"). However, I had little time to read in recent years and \\"Safe Haven\\" is the first Sparks' book I've read since then. I struggled with my rating -- it's a good read and the story is engrossing. I got involved with the characters and the twist at the end (although not really a surprise by that point) was a nice change from how many authors might have handled the ending. However, it seems that Sparks is suffering from the \\"let's just push the next book out\\" malady that often affects best-selling authors -- and his writing style has suffered. The dialogue in many places is so stilted and unnatural that it detracts from the storyline, and he makes beginner-type mistakes (such as in one scene, his characters keep \\"whispering\\" everything to one another, even though they're the only ones in the house and there's absolutely no reason for them to be whispering). As an editor and writer myself, these types of issues bother me more than they might most people, and as I said, it is a good story overall.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A great modern update to a classic childhood game.  It is playable for hours on end with out the need for a pocket full of quatters
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I saw the movie and then read the book and was not disappointed at all. I just wish that they would make a show and base it off the book with every new episode being based on a survivors experience.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I am pleased to finally see a developer not milking me for in game purchases. Just let me play and enjoy. Thanks for the fun game :-)
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This movie is simply the film that I've waited my whole life for. First some background on me. I was born march of 1980; right into the Chris Reeves legendary era. Everything that I had growing up was Supes. I got cracked out on Smallville and watched the whole series and then watched the awesome final season on T.V. I have always idolized Superman as the ideal righteous path in life. I have studied his history through pop-culture and his MANY different takes throughout the years. I followed every detail of this film throughout the course of its production; sometimes waking a thin line of being obsessive. I believed that we would get the Superman of OUR current age a proper treatment. I loved this film. I was moved by everything in this movie. As a child of an adoption myself Supermans inner turmoils and finding where he belongs in the world is something that I think everyone can relate to.<br /><br />Now to the haters. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. The D.C. Characters were created by more than one guy (Stan Lee) over the course of the past 75 years. There are many ways to tell a legend. Marvel characters have simply not been explored by enough writers to create that legend. I.e. there is only one way to tell a Marvel story. Batman and Superman are the O.G.'s, everyone else is wannabes.<br /><br />I went to theaters 5 times to see this. Something that I haven't done since Burton's original Batman.<br /><br />-Kneel
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The twists and turns of this book may surprise you (or not), but the depth of the characters will hold your attention.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I Absolutely Love This App.  The Only Reason It Gets 4 Stars isThat Sometimes The Ads Lock Up My Device And I Have To Restart The Game.  Other Than That The Game Is Easy To Use And Has A Nice Clean Interface.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the best book I've read this summer.  The characters were unique and well-written.  They found themselves in circumstances difficult to contemplate, yet I felt Jojo Moyes had us in the scenes, struggling with the issues.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love falling into this world and living with the characters.  So much so, I've read the series multiple times!
B004AGM6IO|5.0|my grandson is head over heals in love with toy story. wants to watch every nite just before bedtime thanks
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn has a unique talent that appeals to my wanting to read the next novel she writes.  She is quite different than most other novelist.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This person knows the mind of the middle schooler quite well! I really enjoyed it and read it all at one sitting.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a fun game. I've spent lots of time playing this during work &quot;meetings&quot;. Just make sure you have the volume off when played in meetings ;)
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesome especially how fast the money builds up i love it.  download!!! u will not be dissapointed
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|But this is really more like 70's soft rock so I am really enjoying it. Out of the 3 CD's I bought recently this is my favorite or Mother and American Kid.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I enjoyed this book but thought I would laugh a lot more than I did. At times I had trouble staying into the book, but in the end I thought it was just. Okay.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are squeamish about blood & guts don't watch it, but it is SOOOO good. I can't wait until Season 4 starts in October.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This case does what it says! It adjusts to a standing position and the case revolves to length or width viewing preference.  The case is made with quality leather and has an elastic strap to secure it closed.  It does not come with any screen protectors so I suggest investing in one.  Tech Armor Anti-Glare Screen Protectors work great!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the book but I didn't like the way it ended. I really felt like it ended with too many loose ends. I hope I don't  have to wait too long for the next book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It  is the right size large numbers.  I have used the one on the computer but like this so much better
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My children absolutely adore this game. It's beautifully designed, the sound is great and there have been no glitches. It's been teaching my 2 year old hand eye coordination.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I feel as naive as Ana (my namesake) about sex and love and I am 58, a mother and divorced.  I had loved someone that deeply and hurt that deeply that I never could fully love my husband.  I can't blame him for leaving. This book is powerful and I look forward to the next.  Maybe by the last book I will learn enough to be healed of the hurt and ready for love again.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought Gone Girl because it was so highly rated.  After reading it, I really wish that I had skipped it.  Almost every character in the book is a 'psycho' and I just don't find that interesting or worthwhile.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Its very good to use the new Oxford American dictionary to define what u r looking for for the best results from the dictionary
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the most challenging game I have ever played. I play many hidden object games and randomly picked this game and am so glad I did. This game can be very difficult at times but takes much thought to play it. Love it!
B00358ESI4|5.0|Never saw this.  Good friend and Viet Nam vet recommended it.  It is Nam.  And so moving.  I am a Viet Nam era vet and sometimes feel guilty for not going there to support people that are now my friends and this movie will make u appreciate what they endured and the cost!  The war was wrong and most vets know that but the courage and humanity they showed must always be valued and this movie shows it!  Thank you, my fellow vets!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Found the game fun and challenging.  Had to put it down and come back to it later to get out of one room.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I finally caught up with all three seasons, and of course, typical soap opera, as soon as any couple is supremely happy...a death follows.  Anyway, it makes for an interesting story, and Downton Abbey is definitely interesting.  Can't wait for new season to begin!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a good game. Has upgrades and its challenging enough to keep you interested longer than most games.  I would recommend yhr game yo anyone.
B00EKGXA84|5.0|Possibly the best film that showcases Danny Kaye's many talents, but would love to see a blu ray release for it instead.
B005ERX20E|5.0|Angelina Jolie shines in this movie!! This is one of my favorite movies & I'm so excited to finally own it on Blu-ray! The shipping was very fast!
1401922732|5.0|I really enjoy working with these cards.  They are high quality and the accompanying book is very helpful.  I can highly recommend them.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game is great lots to explore and do lots of adventure cant wait to see what else lies ahead let see what is next
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I wanted to see this in the IMAX put never got around to it. However I enjoyed it just as much on my High Def 60 inch TV with Blue Ray.<br />Beautifully shot and excellent adventure without none stop shooting!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a grate game it's like dragon Vail but better. I'd recommend it to anyone from ages 8-15. Fun and a time passer.
B009WUBERW|1.0|Really did not like this movie at all. And I like action movies as a rule. Just bad lines, poor story line. What can I say - I won't be returning to finish this one!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game.<br />I reminded me of when I was a kid.<br />I think you will like it too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Don't give up if the first 25 pages seem boring.  Once the main characters meet, it is a beautiful story with multidimensional characters.  You are torn as to the decision that ultimately must be made but the issue is emotionally and realistically played out.  I could not put the book down and I have given it as gifts to friends.  It is touching and really stays with you.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is so awesome it's like the movie. I love it the movie was awesome<br />Epic is epic<br />I love it
B005XQLBU4|4.0|for anyone who likes the old Atari game Missile Command, this is a much needed and greatly improved version, and is well worth the $0.99. So for a free app of the day is fantastic. I am unable to find what the other people are having issues with. My AVG antivirus detects no problems. This app only has 2 permissions in total. So I don't know what all these paranoid people are really worried about. The only thing I can think of is that they have sense fixed the issue since early this morning. Now there is no virus that can be detected from any antivirus scanners. Stop being paranoid enjoy an old classic......ML
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Really good going to see the movie and I'm going to read the second book! Loved it awesome job loved the end
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|i like the witch bubble game and wanted to give this game a try.  it is fun and my two yr old likes playing it with me.  she is starting to say her colors when qe pla it.
B000004286|1.0|Could only listen to the first ll tracks as the rest were messed up.  Now it is skipping on track six so the whole cd is a waste
B00632HWOG|2.0|For me your calandar is linked to your email.  I use it and depend on it.  I cannot schedule my alerts for a week ahead and I can't see my events on the monthly calendar any more. .
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Of all the boxed sets I own, this one probably gets listened to the most. There is literally not a bad song on all 4 CDs. Everything that later emerged as \\"punk\\" and \\"power pop\\" and \\"neo-psychedelic\\" in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s originally came from some band on this collection. The accompanying booklet is also colorful and informative.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun app but I wish you didn't have to wait 45 min to get more tokens.<br />Would like it more if there weren't so many in app purchases, I am not spending real money on game money.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|The app froze up on me after install.<br />I was never able to open the app and ended up uninstalling it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Got this as Amazon FAOTD.  Love this game. A lot of fun and now looking for other games like this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down! It's addictive the way every book should be. Everyone in my family is reading it now!
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Just when I thought I had it figured out, I was wrong!  I like twists in mysteries, and this book really has them.  The author used phrases in the thoughts of the various characters to lure the reader down a false end in the maze.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that I thought it went on a bit too long!
B005LAIII0|3.0|UNBELIEVABLE graphics-worth seeing the movie. Story unfortunately drug at times. I really never did figure out significence of island being carnivorous
0307740919|5.0|I discovered a place I've never been or visited in this book. I also visited a place I do know something about, the life of a Viet vet, but oh what strength and what interdependence these people show us.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|If you liked the original you are going to love this movie.  Mumbles once again pulls it out of pit of despair..
B003EYVXT6|5.0|I liked the movie.  Interesting concept, but scary.  I like this type of movie as when watching movies, I just want to be entertained.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|A great Pixar love story for all time.  they got it right, love takes time .... the kids were so happy
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great fun for all ages and great graphics and game set up I have had no problems downloading  the game or exiting the game since I had started a week ago playing game
B005GIS1WA|1.0|still don't understand why you chose to give someone something they don't want, and will never will be used.... waste.....
B007TVANDM|5.0|My 7 year old daughter read this at school. It's a great one to have at home and has a great point.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The grand kids love it and I know I got a laugh or three myself.  Love story with a twist..
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|What can one say after all, its glee! The new cast has all the charisma and talent the first cast has, minus Rachel, Mercedes, and Curt of course!!
159463176X|5.0|Interesting; well-written; keep's readers interest to the end.  What more can one say about a good book by an excellent author.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Very unrealistic.....<br />I wouldn't expect my kids to befriend someone in the middle of nowhere .... especially without good reason. I also don't expect some crazy belligerence and violence to come to my neighborhood because of the supposed interaction....<br />I'm straight....
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|I saw this on TV and haven't seen the Blu-Ray yet but I will watch it today. I can't wait! I just saw it (TV) and then ordered it and received it a day early so today is the day. I can't wait to hear the difference on the Blu-Ray. Unfortunately when I opened the shipping packaging I realized that I had received the Blu-Ray and a Reel to Reel and there is an option for an album instead so I am trying to get ahold of Amazon to see what I need to do to exchange this. Until I have an answer, I am not going to open the Blu-Ray and can't really review it properly until I can watch it. When I ordered the Blu-Ray there was no option given to get the album so buyer beware.<br />JH
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Great price for a flash card that is now obsolete.  This card works great.  I will probably buy another one before they're gone.  Fast shipping, too.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have all the Bones season and plan on having a &#34;Bones&#34;  night with the girls. Margaritas and chips and salsa. Can't get much better than that!
0385523394|3.0|First, let me just preface this review by stating that I only found out about this book because of the Netflix series, and was interested in finding out how true to the book the show actually is. SPOILER ALERT - the show is much more dramatic that the memoir, which is why the book was a let-down for me. Overall, the book is a smooth read, a lot of characters to keep track of, but I believe to be an accurate reflection of how life in a women's prison was for Piper Kerman.<br /><br />Second, I really enjoyed Piper's writing style and her own perception of her time in prison. I actually really enjoyed how much her time in prison really made her appreciate her upbringing, as well as all the advantages she had in life AND in prison because of her never ending support system. I thought that her accounts of her feelings of fear, restlessness, and uncertainty were believable. I think that this book is important to highlight the difference between the prisons we see on TV shows, prisons we only hear about, and how prisons are in real life. Especially important is how this minimum security women's prison is so different than the \\"rapey\\" prisons we immediately think about for seriously hardened criminals.<br /><br />Lastly, I think before you pick up this book, you should NOT watch the Netflix series until AFTER you read the book, a big misstep in my process and the ultimate reason I was disappointed in the book. I wanted more drama, I wanted more conflict, and I wanted Piper to feel like she learned a lesson. I really felt like throughout the entire memoir that she was ultimately pissed because she got caught. Being pissed off for breaking the law AND getting caught is a validated reason to be upset. Piper did reap the benefits of dating a drug lord - exotic and frequent trips around the world, new cultural experiences, and having just about anything she wanted. Putting that life of crime behind you is one thing, but I just really never got the feeling that she was \\"sorry\\" for breaking the law. Maybe she isn't. I think I just wanted to feel, as a reader, that she learned her lesson or felt something more than \\"why is this happening to me?\\" I got increasingly annoyed from the repeated quotes of \\"what are you doing here\\" just because she was white, pretty, financially stable, and college educated.  That being said, I think that prison was an unfortunate place for Piper to have such a reality check about her past life decisions, but I think she really grew as a person during her time there, and that she made her time in prison work for her. She learned new skills, was forced to interact with people she probably would never have chosen to interact with (based on how she described her life, I made that assumption), and really came to value the people in her life on a new level.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|My husband and i are going to the Bon Jovi concert so I wanted to listen to his music again before we went. It is great and brings back lots of memories.
B009JZTQOS|1.0|I wont be buying anymore movies from Amazon in the future..they cut out all the good parts of this movie.We were totally disappointed to pay that much only to have the best parts blocked out!!! What a rip off!!!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I bought power ups and then it charged my account but never provided the power ups. It would charge for 2 power ups and then only give one. I would pay for Bingo balls and it would charge but not provide. Do not buy any of the power ups or bingo balls.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game picks up pace fast so make every shot count. Would be helpful to be able to replay easier levels for points
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I tried to get on but it keeps saying string not found and then it goes back to the homepage !!! DO NOT GET ATTACHED TO THE GAME!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This app has a nice smooth operation on my GS3. Good graphics and so far no crashes. Good free app of the day.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Finally I found the Google app and have been enjoying my searches ever since on my kindle fire. This app works perfectly.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|Junk,will not work on ASUS TRANSFORMER T700 nor on KINDLE FIRE HD. Kind of defeats the purpose of owning a cloud drive. Once again disappointment as usual from Western Digital.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|My grandkids request this for Christmas and watch a lot.  When I visit them in Texas, it's one of their favorite movies.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is awesome. It's so simple but so much fun. simple design. I highly recommend this game. I'm glad they made this game free.
0064471837|5.0|I have always been an avid reader, and when my grandmother gave me her copies of the Abhorsen trilogy, I was excited but cautious (as until this point she had only given me strange and random nonfiction books). However, once I started Sabriel, I was wildly impressed, and basically devoured the entire trilogy. I love Garth Nix's writing style in everything he does, but this is really my favorite book. Admittedly, I enjoy the book so much that I read it very fast, so it is especially my favorite book to re-read, as I always notice something new that I never noticed before.<br /><br />A realm with magic is always a viable option for a literary escape, but Nix put his own twists on the idea of magic, making the story original and unpredictable. The story itself has a balanced mix of light, dark, loving, dangerous, and humorous tones and events. I always enjoy banter between characters, and was never disappointed (especially with the character Mogget, who always had marvelously witty comebacks).<br /><br />I won't provide a summary, as that has been done. My main goal is to demonstrate how much I truly love reading this book, along with those following it. Sabriel is a wonderful start to the trilogy, but I believe is magnificent enough that it stands on its own, though I am extremely grateful that Nix explored the world of Sabriel further in writing the other books.<br /><br />All in all, if you've spent the time reading this entire review, and are still on the fence about buying this book - DO IT. You will not regret it, I personally cannot thank my grandmother enough for introducing me to Sabriel. The plot, setting, and characters are all well conceived and well written. The heroine and all others are relatable, and teach readers about strength in adversity, not to mention that the world of Sabriel provides a magnificent environment to escape to - and isn't that why we read, to escape sometimes dreary aspects of our own lives and also learn something along the way?
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book is a nice reminder that the imagination that was once encouraged during childhood should not be forgotten in adulthood.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Good graphics. Entertaining. Simple button mashing game that holds my eleven year olds attention for awhile. Variety of costumes and even capable of vs. on wi-fi.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best of the best, my son and i are geting the most out of this game! WOW WOW WOW. Playing day and night,  very impresive graphics, nice music.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I Loved Julianna when she was on ER but I love her even more on The Good Wife.  She is excellent at not revealing what she is thinking and wears a poker face really well.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I FIND IT EASY.....CONVENIENT.....BETTER THAN THE OLDER GOOGLE...<br />.REMEMBERS YOUR LAST SEARCH...<br />LOVE THE TABS....BIG HELP IN SEARCH....THANK YOU GOD BLESS.
1444777556|5.0|great to see to the bond of friendship and loyalty between bob and james as it continues to grow.  this a story of true friendship!! these two have made great progress in helping one another and want them to do the same for each other for many more years to come!! best of luck to james and bob!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a bit more fun then the usual missile defence game. Still would be runner though with like a more old school theme
1442337966|1.0|This book is very new age, and since I am not a follower of new age beliefs, I was very disappointed with this product.
B0085322K0|4.0|An old book but still good. The story of a young boy off on a treasure hunt and growing up along the way still entertains and carries the reader away to another time. I liked how the book is laid out for a Kindle and the illustrations were clear and you could enlarge them if you want. An excellent value and a great tale for reading to young ones while traveling in the car. Yeah, it's not as easy as hooking the kids up to a DVD player but much more rewarding and starts good conversations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game with my girls. It teaches them good skills and they are learning how to take care of a pet. It is their favorite game.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Suspenseful.  It left you wondering what would happen next.<br />I can't wait to read the whole story.  I would recommend this book to all Jack Teacher fans.
0689835604|3.0|My baby absolutely adores this book, but after one use, the flaps were bent and now they're ripping off. My friend also has this book and most of the flaps have been ripped off. I'm not sure why they made the material so thin for babies. If it weren't for that, I would rate this 5 stars.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love the music so much.  It is hard to believe how America missed this artist but I am so happy we have him now.  The music seems new and just as relevant today as it was when he wrote and performed it so long ago.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|fun game<br />good hand eye coordination.  very good time waster. worth the money.you can play this game for a long time.it gets harder as you go.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|works as it should i use it daily to bust out my art work.  just sucks not being able to get any skin i want but i still dig it
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Classic Quentin Tarantino. Star-studded cast at their absolute best.  If you are a fan this movie will not disappoint you!
1455523550|2.0|I hadn't read Nicholas Sparks for a long time and picked up the book after seeing the movie. I found both to be a bit predictable and boring. I also found a few incidences that didn't seem quite right. Just little things and nothing blatant or obviously wrong - like the age of the children. I thought Josh was older based on what the book said about Kristen going to school soon and how Josh is presented, but Katie asks him about kindergarten. Also, when Katie first talks about Kevin, he is abusive because he didn't get to relax on his day off, but he is talking about his work on the next page. It just didn't seem to flow. Just missed the mark for me.
B00009V7PK|3.0|I really liked her 1999 show done at the MGM casino in Vegas far more.<br /><br />In her 'Farewell Tour' she sings a lot of the same songs as the 1999 has,  but the 'acts' and her exuberance just seem to be lacking 'something'.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|Good movie, better than the original one with great special effects.  If you like action movies you'll like it.  Some of the scenes are spectacular and original.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was fun to figure the levels out but wished it had a few more levels. really liked the multiple room levels.
B003G4W49C|5.0|True science fiction at its best.  The storytelling was so real that you could feel that you were there with Ender and the other characters.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|the old version worked great, all updates now it doesn't work at all  thats all there is there is no more
1449410243|2.0|Poorly drawn, layout is messy, and it is just generally unappealing. I couldn't wait to put it down. Forget it, and buy &#34;I Could Pee on This.&#34;
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great classic game with some modern features.  I enjoy the ability to upgrade your missles. Though difficulty is a little on the day side.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|My grandkids love this series and I bought it for them to read whenever they get bored. Although I don't think they've finished it yet,
B0052VI2V6|5.0|The Multi Channel Remaster is so smooth and natural on SACD. I hear elements I never heard in the original 2 channel CD release but I don't get a sense that the music has been &#34;messed with&#34; much.<br /><br />Ther multi guitar solo's in hotel California each get such carefully crafted treatment and &#34;placement&#34; in the multi channel stage, they are pure joy to re-experience.  I like this album even more than I did originally, which is saying alot!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|At first, I thought the game would be kind of dumb. Just thought, &quot;hey, free game, what the heck..&quot; But it's actually pretty entertaining! It seems easy at first, but definitely gets harder as you go. Enjoy!
B0009A21R6|5.0|Althought I enjoy all of the elements of the songs on this legendary album that are brought to the for-front in the multichannel SACD mix of this ablum, I am a bit taken aback but how much the songs sound &#34;messed with&#34; in this remastered edition.<br /><br />Not enought respect was given to the original feel of the great prduction value in the original album. Instead the producer on this album seemed to have been looking to create a new experience. This has it's benefits but wears thin soon and leaves you missing the original &#34;tempurature&#34; of the earlier releases of this album.<br /><br />Fun, but I'd rather have a good vinyl edition.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Its okay its just that there is not very many and i got through it in maybe half an hour. I recommend you to wait a couple more weeks.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|A good game to play to kill time. I think that they could give more bubbles on some boards . Other than that, it's great! Highly addictive.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is sooooo much fun its great for the younger Kurdish and its addicting too. get this app NOWWWW!!!!!!!!:)
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This is a great app. I use a calculator all the time and this is a large screen, and easy to use..
B008JFUPPI|5.0|TOTALLY DON'T SEE THE CRITIC'S PROBLEM WITH THIS FILM! IT'S AWESOME AND FUNNY AND ACTION PACKED AND HAS AWESOME ACTNG IN IT (PARTICULARLY JEFF BRIDGES)! IT'S COOL!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read! Connelly keeps up a good pace, and fills it with loads intregue. I'd reccomend it to any one
B004LROMWU|5.0|The order came faster than I thought it would and I have been searching for this product. In the future I will be ordering season 2 and 3. I have watched some of season 1 everyday since I got it. Spent the first day watching it in its entirety. Now if you would hire my son at your Lebanon location I would really be happy.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Although Piper Kerman is the creative adviser to the Netflix Mini series - this book is different from the mini-series.  While I have enjoyed both, I must admit I enjoyed the mini-series more than the book.  The book is informative and perhaps even more realistic than the series.  I only wish I had read the book prior to seeing the mini-series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very descriptive book.  The story leaves you breathless wanting more.  Christian is the love Ana so desires and his deep passion for her is eloquent yet rough and needing.  So many emotions on the edge of a knife.  Downloading the next one immediately!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written, unexpected plot twists and interesting storytelling format.  It reveals humanity at it's worst. I finished the book saddened that this story had so much deceit, dysfunction &selfishness. Absolutely Hated the ending.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|The CD looks great, but doesn't have the same edge that American Capitalist had.  FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH is my favorite band...but this CD sort of let me down.  There are really only like 3 good songs on it.  I hope Volume Two is better.
140123769X|4.0|The George R.R. Martin of comic book authors. Trust this man with your heart only if you don't have one to lose.
0307476073|5.0|I got this book for my wife.  When she finished it, she loved it so much I had to read it as well.  I just finished reading this book and really loved it.  I'm not a female, I haven't experienced the trauma that she has and couldn't identify with much of what she was going through.  I still couldn't get enough of this author and her book!  That's good writing!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was looking for not your typical romance book and this was it!  The book kept you guessing the whole time... you couldn't wait to get to the next chapter.  Some people don't like the ending, but I thought it was all creative.  I would recommend reading.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|The music from this production is so much fun and very catchy.  It is nice to have the words to all the songs in the booklet.  Someday I would like to see this musical.  It would make a great movie too!
B009WUBERW|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  It was a little gory for me but the humor and intense action was fun to watch.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game in the house with you I'll be there with a range of them typically a bit of this is important for me me me to take a nap with you or I'll something like that and the kids to
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Interesting movie with unexpected insights into politics.  I have read about the tactics used to pass bills, however it was a very different experience to observe it.  The actors were well matched to the characters that they portrayed.  I would watch it again.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|very happy with this app.  did not like the recent upgrade of weather channel app.  this is better.doesn't have radar but that's ok.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My six year old daughter loves this app! She enjoys caring for the horses and feeding them. Highly recommended this app for horse lovers!
140006922X|4.0|I purchased a copy of Zealot for my mother. She hasn't remarked on how she likes it as of yet.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Probably the best heroes of Olympus book yet! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Definitely exciting.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game so so much I play this game all the time and I never get bored I really suggest this game
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is a fun diversion.  It has a lot of the same elements of the old game but the biggest difference is the touch interface.  I don't know if that's necessarily an upgrade, but it is mildly amusing.
1421527618|5.0|This novel is completely engrossing, fast-paced, and a very quick read. The book is completely brilliant, and soon to be a major movie that Tom Cruise will surely stink up. Not sure how they can do the book justice.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game alot I cant stop playing i would recommend this game to anyone.good time killer but dont get to caught up
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Any old Atari fans out there? This is not only a great game to drown away a couple hours, the point system for upgrades is fairly addictive. 5 stars!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. So much so, I was ready to make the jump to digital download (steaming) vs blu ray purchase. I find that it was an error. Whether it was the hardware (Sony), the service (Amazon), or the the network (TWC) or maybe Friday night?, it comes down to HD streaming from Amazon is not ready for prime time. $15.00 for subpar video at 16mbs is a let down. Pixelation during most movement is very annoying for a HD movie, full action scenes are worse. At 16mbs streaming, at least that is what is being reported during presentation (My service is 20mbs) should be more than enough.<br /><br />Buy the blu ray. Avoid streaming, until proven otherwise, DVD is better..
B0000541B2|5.0|Babies are as good as the one that came with the system brand new. We've been using these for several months and it's just like we have a new Sony PlayStation.
B0044KI79S|5.0|I watched the series when it first came out, but then stopped due to being too busy with work.  A friend recommend I watch this episode.  It was hilarious!  I think I may need to figure out a way to start watching the series again.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Other reviewers state malware, I see no signs of it so I am going to assume it was removed. I have scanners that constantly find some in Amazon's FAOTD but happily found none in here. I just spent 15 minutes trying out the game, which wasn't supposed to take that long.<br /><br />Disclaimer!<br />I am rooted and used another app to disable the ad components I found. None of these components however are those that cause ad pop-ups.
3836538725|5.0|Genesis, as all Salgado's books, is exquisite.  He is one of the greatest photographers of our time, and all time.<br />Amazing photographs.  And he offers his books at affordable prices.  Hard to believe such quality is within financial reach.
B00D6QUMWG|1.0|I was surprised to learn that this is the result of five years of work.  In brief: I found AN's latest CD bland, monotonous, boring, and overall unconvincing in the Verdi repertoire. She does not have the requisite Italianate expression, the phrasing is choppy, and the musicianship lefts a lot to be desired. Her top notes are sometimes strained and her low register is seriously underpowered and unattractive. Her voice is getting darker and (to my ears) unpleasantly so. The trills in the coloratura are still questionable. The best pieces are from Lady Macbeth; the worst are Elena's Bolero, Tu che le vanita, and the excerpts from Il Trovatore.<br /><br />For Verdi soprano arias you are better off if you stick with the classics: Callas (for Lady MacBeth), Tebaldi (for Giovanna d'Arco), Caballe (for Il Trovatore and Don Carlo), and Cerquetti (for I Vespri).
140006922X|5.0|This book really is absolutely great. Like probably a few of you, I bought it because I saw that Fox News interview that the author had, and so I became curious (I'm also studying to become a historian, so this is right up my ally). It really gives you a great insight into first century-Palestine, and the events and surrounding that Jesus the man went through. For those of you hoping to find Jesus the Christ, look elsewhere. This book is not about the mythological/theological Christ, it is what we can know about the actual human being based on his surroundings.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This site is the mind and heart's version of eating your vegetables.  But these &#34;vegetables&#34; are perfectly ripe, expertly prepared, exquisitely seasoned, and completely satisfying.  You don't need a lot of time, either.  These talks are very succinct, yet extremely powerful.  It's possible to be impressed, enlightened, touched, and moved to laughter, in only 15 minutes or less!  I highly recommend TED!
1616550414|5.0|If you're a Zelda fan, then you want this, because it answers all those nagging questions. What is the time line? Who IS Link? It's great.

B001NHNG64|3.0|I have been a Lee Child fan for years.  At times, however, Child's attention to detail slows down the tempo of the story and I found that to be the case in &#34;Die Trying&#34;.  An average read.
0786838655|3.0|I liked the overall style of the book, the action moved along pretty good, and it was fun figuring out which god or monster Percy was facing by the hints the authors dropped.  However, I kept running into little bits of things that really irked me.  For example, camaros do not have four doors.  And riding Amtrak, you do not go through St Louis on your way from New York to Denver.  Little things like that, while not really that material to the story, are still enough to irk me.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if those hadn't kept jumping out at me.
B007XF0X16|4.0|We did not watched the movie, instead we gave it as a gift to our son and his family who has a Blu-ray player.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is a little bit more trouble than it's worth.  Yeah it doesn't cost anything to get it but believe me when I tell you that you'll end up paying a small fortune if you want all the animals / goodies.  Just say no if you want to be safe.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app has saved me so much time with my photos. Using my usb cable was so troublesome &amp; didn't always succeed. This app is always easy to use, so I don't wait until I have a large group of photos to transfer or back up.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I can't describe how awesome this movie was, especially considering that we are able to see it for free because we are prime members on Amazon.com
B00DB624GS|5.0|Many of the reviews here are for earlier versions of this album. Note to Amazon SEPERATE the REVIEWS by EDITION!<br />This new edition is great, it sounds fine and the Bonus Tracks are tasty. Don't be put off by Oh Well being spread over<br />two tracks.You don't hear a break when you play the CD all the way through.<br />What can I say about the music? If you know the Album you know this is one fine CD.<br />I just bought the Album for the third time and i'm glad I did.<br />If all you have is the old CD this is well worth buying again.
0399226907|3.0|This wasn't the best book for my little man, the cloth books and interactive books that are available are much more interesting and cost about the same
1936608898|5.0|This book was an eye opener! I found it easy to read without so much technical terms and explanations. I go back to this book frequently
B004J64QSI|5.0|To begin, I first saw Les MIserables in my hometown about 8 to 10 years ago at our local theater.  My seats were very uncomfortable and I was not familiar with the story.  While I enjoyed it, because of the seating and acoustics at that place, I really could not appreciate the songs or the story.  A few years later I happened to be surfing the channels on my TV and I happened to come upon a PBS broadcast of the 10th Anniversary Concert in London with most of the original cast.  I did not see all of it but what I saw peaked my interest.  I rented it a year later on Netflix and I have not gone back.  I have a tendency to fixate so I then began a search of everything Les Miserables, musical and not musical to include and French version of the story with subtitles.  Not bad rendition.  I have since read Victor Hugo's Tome and believe me it was a trial to read but I read it and finished it.  Obviously we are all aware of the Movie production which walked off with awards galore.<br /><br />The 25 the Anniversary Album was a welcome addition to my collection.  The voices and production similar to the 10th were excellent.  It was great to see at the end some of the original cast.  This is a beautiful rendition.  Les Miserables enchants me.  I enjoyed the movie but after hereing the 10th and 25th Anniversarys no comparison.  Wonderful acting but voices were only ok.  I just saw an local production in Thomaston Connecticut and the singing level there was superb so much better than the movie.  So enjoy this version -it is superb and the music - oh the music - it is superb.  Thank you Victor Hugo Thank you producers of Les Mis.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good easy fun. I enjoy playing while taking a dump. Or after awkward sex with my girlfriends sister. Not an enjoyable game whole intoxicated, it will make you throw your phone into something hard.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|this game would not download to my original kindle fire even after I deleted other apps. kept saying unable to complete download.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Received our movies very quickly and unharmed! Thank you. :)<br /><br />Great buy, saw all 6 movies for 89.00 at the PX on Fort Belvoir.  Ordering 3-6, and 1-3 was definitely a great deal.
B00CELB94E|5.0|this record reminds me more of oasis and the first beady eye album overall 5 stars great I really like it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Just a great read that shows Jesus and biblical stories in the social, religious, and political context.  One of the central questions I have sought to answer in reading about the historical Jesus and early Christians is why did this messiah and this religion spread while others died out. This book catapulted me towards understanding this.There are places I personally would have liked Aslan to go, but he kept true to his formula to show Jesus as a Messiah in the Jewish tradition under the Roman rule.
B00C7E3EFU|4.0|[[ASIN:B00C7E3EFU The Fog]] Blu-ray Review<br /><br />Year:  1980   Rating:  R   Runtime: 1HR, 29 MIN Aspect Ratio: 2.39:1   Video Resolution: 1080P Audio: Eng 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Eng 2.0 DTS-HD MA   Subtitles: English<br /><br />Director: John Carpenter<br />Writer: John Carpenter, Debra Hill<br />Starring: Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Tom Atkins, Hal Holbrook, John Houserman<br /><br />Film Rating: ★★★☆☆<br />Video Rating: ★★★★☆<br />Audio Rating: ★★★☆☆<br />Extras Rating: ★★★★☆<br />Overall Rating: ★★★★☆<br /><br />John Carpenter's [[ASIN:B00C7E3EFU The Fog]] is a strange horror movie specimen.  It has a small cult following of diehard fans but is rarely mentioned with much enthusiasm amongst horror fans.  It has two major factors working against it; it's just not that great of a movie and it's easily forgotten sandwiched between greater John Carpenter films like Halloween, Escape from New York and The Thing.  Even with that said however there's something... in the fog... that keeps audiences coming back year after year.<br /><br />The citizens of the small seaside town of Antonio Bay are preparing for its centennial celebration.  Unbeknownst to them their town's horrible past is about to catch up with them as a mysterious fog also brings with it murderous ghosts that begin attacking the townspeople.<br /><br />Despite The Fog not being a horror classic in the same vein as Halloween there's still a lot to like about the film.  It has a great cast including Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing), Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins (Lethal Weapon), Janet Leigh (Psycho) and Hal Holbrook.  In addition to its cast the old school special effects are charming, it has a unique looking setting and even though John Carpenter's synthesizer score is dated it is still eerily enjoyable.  The Fog is a simple horror film with low aspirations but that doesn't make it any less fun to watch on a foggy fall night.<br /><br />This release from Scream Factory (a subsidiary of Shout! Factory) marks the first time that The Fog has been made available on Blu-ray aside from a British release back in 2009.  I do not have a copy of that version to compare this disc to in terms of quality but this release does make specific mention to a new high-definition transfer supervised by the film's original cinematographer, Dean Cundey.<br /><br />There won't be any confusing this thirty-three year old film with a modern release but it still looks good nevertheless.  There are some occasional scratches; some are the result of the optical special effects, others appear to be just wear and tear on the master print.  Regardless, none are overly distracting; in fact I think they add a certain amount of charm to film.  Black levels are generally good, grain remains intact, the artifacting never becomes an issue in the foggiest of scenes.<br /><br />Sadly there are a couple disparaging moments scattered throughout The Fog and they both center around scenes involving Janet Leigh.  At 29:06 and again at 33:30 there's a distracting lightening or halo effect around the characters- it could be a flaw in the original photographer or some digital manipulation to increase the amount of contrast focused on the characters versus their surroundings.  It goes away quickly but it does spoil an otherwise great presentation if only for a few minutes.<br /><br />The Fog features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix as well as a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mix that represents the original mono audio track.  Because of the low budget nature of the film there's only so much that can be done with the original source materials.  The film appears to have been heavily looped, there's some \\"scratchiness\\" with some of the dialogue none of which is a direct reflection on either of the mixes available on this disc.  Short of an expensive restoration this is as good as you can expect The Fog to sound; John Carpenter's synthesizer score rings true, dialogue is mostly clear and there's a decent amount of range- just don't expect a lot of directionality.  Overall both tracks sound very good but I do prefer the 2.0 mix simply because that's how the film was originally presented during its original theatrical run.<br /><br />There's a large selection of special features on this release some of which are new, others are recycled from previous releases.<br /><br />There are two audio commentaries; the first features director John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill which dates back all the way to the days of Laserdisc (Hill passed away in 2005), the second track features actors Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins and Production Designer Tommy Lee Wallace.  The Carpenter/Hill track is very dry when compared to the more laid back track of Barbeau, Atkins and Wallace but both are informative in different ways.<br /><br />My Time with Terror with Jamie Lee Curtis is a 21 minute long candid interview with the original \\"Scream Queen\\" Jamie Lee Curtis.  She speaks honestly about her time in the horror genre and is quite frank about both her successes and failures.  This is definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />A nice complementary piece is Dean of Darkness with Dean Cundey.  This 18 minute piece sits down with cinematographer Dean Cundey and explores nuances of framing an effective horror film along with some of his other career highlights.<br /><br />You'll also find several vintage featurettes including Fear on Film: Inside The Fog and Tales from the Mist: Inside The Fog.  Both are filled with original interviews from the film's original release but only hardcore fans will find them all that exciting.<br /><br />Horror's Hallowed Grounds: A Look at the Film's Locations is hosted by Sean Clark and is an entertaining look at the locations featured in The Fog.  It does sadly go off the rails a bit towards the end as it attempts to plug some other upcoming Shout! Factory films.<br /><br />Other special features include The Fog: Storyboard to Film, Outtakes, Special Effects Tests, Theatrical Trailers, TV Spots, a Photo Gallery, and Storyboards.  There is also a hidden Easter Egg on the second page of the special features; an ABC Sunday Night Movie Promo that is located in the gravestones.  It's a great Easter Egg that is perfect to watch right before you watch the film.<br /><br />John Carpenter's [[ASIN:B00C7E3EFU The Fog]] isn't a perfect horror film by any stretch of the imagination but it isn't without its positive attributes.  This Blu-ray delivers a charming video presentation, faithful audio and plenty of special features to please even the most fervent fans.  Whether you're a fanatic John Carpenter fan or just a casual fan of vintage horror you should definitely consider picking up The Fog.e is mostly clear and there's a decent amount of range- just don't expect a lot of directionality.

B00BAWEGPW|4.0|Cute series of books! love love love the pin and ink sketches...I can't believe that they are making me write more words...
0316227706|5.0|This book makes me happy!  I have picked it up & at the least,  leafed through every day since I got it. Just looking at the cover makes me smile.  One of the best purchases I've ever made!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Shows that us old people can still be bad ass. Soldier on guys and gals. you were great to watch
B004CRR9G0|4.0|While this is not my favorite Studio Ghibli film, it is definitely better than what I recall from when I saw it years ago. If you can ignore the preaching on man living in harmony with the environment and avoiding war at all possible costs, there is a lot to like about this movie. Nausicaa cares deeply for not only her people but for everyone including the supposed enemy of mankind. But while her anti-war stance makes for a good movie, it bears little resemblance to real life where one's enemies are bent on destruction. But who knew that insects were more intelligent than people?!?<br /><br />And this Blu_ray package does not disappoint. The HD transfer is wonderful. There is a DVD copy (handy for soccer Moms and Dads who need to keep the rugrats occupied for long trips in the family van), multiple commentaries, subtitles and languages. There is even even the English subtitle of the Japanese audio, as well as the English subtitle of the English audio.<br /><br />Not quite 5 stars, perhaps 4.5.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|I love the Rock, but he took over the lead from a good actor. Also, snakeeyes tends to use alot of guns, and in all the past things and series, he doesn't use guns. hes a ninja, not a sharp shooter
B009PAETCG|1.0|Doesn't let you play kid version without buying it<br /><br />There's better games or apps just browse around and they're really free
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love the lore being done here, i hope to see him evolve into the green arrow super hero that we all know
B0076DELIG|4.0|Great story line and ingenious plot. Harry Bosch is a very believable character and Connelly gives him a real and interesting set of values that help to shape his actions that lead to finding the real doers of crime!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|First of all I just want to say how happy I am with the packaging update for this movie. This looks so much better, IMO. As for the movie itself, I went in with high expectations. Although the last Zack Snyder film I saw, I didn't like, I had high hopes for Man of Steel. I was richly rewarded. This is a spectacular film on many levels. The music alone is so epic that I just can't stop listening to the soundtrack, it's beautiful, calming, powerful, thoughtful, sweeping, majestic, etc, just like the film itself. It is also such a visual feast that I can't wait to watch it again to pick up things I missed. Henry Cavill did an incredible job as Clark/Kal-El/Superman. Whoah, poor Superman has three personalities, not just two like most Superheroes. Anyway, he looked amazing, and his acting was perfect for the part, IMO. Russell Crowe did a good job as Jor-El, and I liked the scenes on Krypton a lot. It was nice to bring more of Krypton into the cinematic world of Superman. Kevin Costner did an excellent job as Jonathan Kent. Pa Kent's contribution to this film had some controversial elements, but it felt real to me, and I thought Costner' execution of the role was brilliant. Michael Shannon's Zod was very good. I liked his Zod a lot. But, I felt that newcomer Antje Traue as Faroa Ul, Zod's lieutenant was the best villain in the film. She was down right creepy cool! She was more of an enigma than Zod. Her personality was ruthless, and knowing less about her and her motives/motivation made her more intriguing to me. Traue did a marvelous job of making her screen time memorable. I hope she makes it back from the Phantom Zone in upcoming films. Her fight scene with Superman in Smallville was the best one in the entire movie, IMO. There were some problems with the resolutions of the plot in some ways, but I still loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very good game, a little time consuming (maybe that's my fault). I like that you can collect puzzle pieces meaning more objectives for the game so it doesn't get to boring.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. In this game you have two modes survival and creative obviously creative and survival are self explanatory so I won't explain overall this is a great game, oh and one note thing if thou haven't already spent your Amazon tokens use it on this (the price is high)good luck and enjoy;)
B001NHNG64|4.0|I really enjoyed the second Teacher story. He does it all. I like how Child's how Teacher figure out situations. Looking forward to book three!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|For a Free App Of The Day I can't complain. It's better then a lot of the other FAOTD. It does get somewhat repetitive, but I still find myself playing it. Not a lot of options during the fight, only punch an block, that's why I said it's probably better for kids than for adults. It is entertaining though, an I'm sure my 7 year old nephew would love it. It's cool that you can change the way your character looks. The training to build up you power/speed/endurance is a nice touch. For $2.99 I would NOT buy this game! For $0.99 I would consider it though. The dev really needs to adjust their pricing!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I want to preface this review by saying I`m a fan of Connely`s. While I enjoy a good suspense and mystery, this story left me feeling a bit cheated. I was not fond of Twain`s short story The Tiger and I found too much similarity with this ending.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD was given to me as a gift and the giver had already put the Kindle inside this case. I have been very pleased with the case as it makes it easier for me to handle the Kindle and I like that the device goes into sleep mode when you close the lid. I like that it has the elastic band to hold the carrier flap when opened.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun for all ages worth the down load it takes a few to get started but worth it very addicting
068484267X|5.0|I loved hearing about Ireland, having just recently returned from a visit there.  I could not believe the childhood this man had..........I could not put the book down!  It truly is a great read :)
B000001E21|3.0|This album has a few good Def Leppard songs on it. Def Leppard should have stopped making music after this album or just put out a single here and there.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT GAME  I THOUGH THE IT WAS GOING THE BE A RAISING GAME THIS GAME IS JUST AWESOME
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great way to spend time. Kept me entertained and was not mind numbing. The puzzles were  challenging. Would recommend this game.<br /><br />.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Well written.  I found it hard to put it down.  You are caught in Elizabeth's life and keeps your interest throughout.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|If you have never seen the shield...check it out.  Very good acting with just enough social commentary without sounding preachy. I really enjoyed it, but not for kids. Lots of sexual content not graphic but best not for children.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|My boys love superhero movies so i bought them this movie and that loved it!  They cant wait to get the 2nd movie now!!
B00338QENI|4.0|This is a good book to read It is interesting and informative. Because of the nature of the material that the author tried to collect. She had to put herself into the story more than I would have liked. Although after reading the story I agree it had to be written this way.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I have read all his books and loved them all.  This one I just liked it. I guess I was looking for a happier ending for Dawson.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I think the points you get after a round should be for upgrades.  seems to have no direct reflection. But its free :)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I watched the TV series and then read this first book of the series to see what it was like. I'm now hooked! The depth of the character development & plot is surprising. This book was one of the series episodes too, but in this instance &#34;the show didn't do the book justice&#34;.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie - did not expect it to be so good. Full of surprises and Denzel is terrific as usual.
B000FC1CUA|4.0|Reading the classics is so different than reading the literature of today. It speaks to a different time and place, like a viewing a photograph of a historical moment.  What Wilde accomplishes in Dorian Gray is wonderful.  His descriptive powers are noteworthy, leaving me thinking that what I had read was exactly like London and its society was like during that time.  Wilde does go off on several descriptive tangents that in my kind were not necessary to the book.  Overall, it is a complex story, intricately woven which makes the reader think about Dorian's character time and time again. A recommendable book that could promote a good book club discussion as well.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Predictable, Awful. I can't believe I spent money on this. I'm so disappointed! It took a while to get into, and then halfway through, I predicted the outcome, and it was pretty much the worst ending ever!!! ugh.
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|It is easy to use.<br />However, the picture color is slightly affected after using the lens.<br />General speaking, it is good.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|When selecting a book the Kindle Store function displays a blank page.<br />When the Kindle Store is selected, 5 of the Editor's Picks are displayed and the application hangs.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nice take on the old classic.  I really am enjoying it.  The upgrades are a welcome addition.  Also being able to repair your buildings helps keep the game going.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best programs on television.  American television should take a good long look at British television and make some changes.  Then maybe there'd be decent programs to watch on standard American TV stations.  I have watched Downton Abbey Seasons 1, 2 and 3 each twice.  I can hardly wait for it to premiere in January with it's 4th season.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|this is a story of love affair through time itself. It is treachery and lies deceit and cunning and it keeps you guessing and hoping for good and happy endings. I hope all will enjoy this like my family did.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After I saw the movie with Tom Cruise, I felt that I had to read the author.  Too bad that they aren't going to make more movies because this character is FANTASTIC and the writer smart.  I've just started reading this book and so far, so good.  I like the characters, the storyline and the vivid descriptions...<br /><br />I look forward to reading ALL of his books.<br />Enjoy<br /><br />Kimberly
B003UESJH4|5.0|I really liked the movie, the actors were really good. The movie was a drama but it does have some funny moments
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very nice! Fun game, easy controls. Got it free, so price was right too. Probably would not buy, but fun for free!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Haven't read one of his books that hasn't  been great. I can't  wait for the third of his &#34; century&#34; trilogy to be published.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love amazon free app of the day when its a good one like this.  Great Great game really Fun
1401938906|3.0|I found the same as reviwer who wrote\\" sadly- experimentts did not work out for me either\\" Just more tired manifesting and struggle.<br />I found I was s oready to give it up and surrender after attempting one more self help book<br />Louise needs to become more discerning: not everyone HH publishes is amazing<br /><br />I was so ...hopeful<br />It was interesting but not powerful
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'm not one for romance novels but this series has been really fun and often very funny. I wouldn't read this if I hadn't read the first two.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a good read, I read her first novel, Sharp Objects first, and I loved that one.  This is a good book, with a lot of unexpected turns, however I feel like she didn't really know how to end it, it sort of dragged on toward the end, and the final twist just did me in!  I didn't enjoy this one as much as Sharp Objects, however I am yet to read Dark Places, that is next.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|alot of color and not so much protection from drops,if you work construction then do not get this case, its defo a white collar case
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It has the old style of missile defense that is revamped with a leveling system and better graphics. Overall it is very smooth gameplay.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is simple but fun. It passes boring times with some enjoyment. I don't think you will be disappointed. If you don't want to purchase it try the free version. Then I think you will purchase the full version.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I take each movie and judge it for what it is. This is a Sci-Fi movie and a very good one. I enjoyed the special effects and the story line was engaging. Most of all as a Trekkie, I enjoyed the humor and plot references to the original Star Trek TV Show and the spin-off movies. I watched it with My 9 year old son who is like most kids a huge Star War's fan and he thought this movie was \\"Awesome\\" and a must buy when it releases blu-ray. It will be added to collection for sure!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game's physics-based *puzzles* keep me entertained! but, I'm not often stuck for days like some more complex levels in (Rovio) games. This HD version works on my DROID-X :) Good job, Zeptolab!! Very worth $1.
B007AL48UK|2.0|I got it but since there were NO directions, I could not figure out how to play it.  I am college graduate so I'm not stupid.  How are we suppose to know how to play these games if they be never have instructions?.  I removed it off my Kindle
B00881VLCE|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but the app can be slow to respond.  I love the puzzles and the layout better than any others. I feel a few of the puzzle packs are over priced<br />.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Simple premise stretched out to its max,while never going over the edge into the abyss.  Wonderful light read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Play for a few minutes of an hour. A lot of fun to play. Worth the cost. Challenging fun a very good time killer. Upgradeable in game. No extra cost to play.
B006PAO2FS|5.0|I love this album! It sounds amazing on vinyl and I love what Paul has created! He always seems to know how to wow a crowd.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would without hesitation give this book a 5-star rating.  It was like reading and confirming so much of what I already believe and KNOW....The I am discourses brought me to Anita's awareness 35 years ago.  If you could only have one book in our life, this would bring you all the bliss yo can hold!  Thank you Anita, Wayne and the Universe we each are for allowing this message into my life now!!!<br /><br />Isis Adams, m.Ed.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is awesome! Gameloft really delivers....awesome quality. Exactly like the original card game I loved. You have to sign in with Facebook in order to access all the game's features but playing as a guest is still great. My main problem is the token system....the games should be unlimited instead of having to depend on 'scratch' or winning games to obtain them in order to play games.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|great to have on your tablet phone on the go check your acc.buy see your purchases it is just great all round
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Defend your cities by shooting down incoming missiles.  Watch out for the flying saucers. They take a real pounding to bring down.
B00008PX8P|5.0|What can I say but I LOVED this. I LOVE Zeppelin! Always have and always will...I was too young to see Zeppelin live so this was my personal experience of being there.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|This song rocks and makes you want to dance. Very powerful statement about taking your life back and making a statement. It is NOTHING like the boring song Brave as some reviews state. An overall catchy but powerful pop anthem.
1423136802|5.0|i am a huge fan and love Greek mythology and since the books are based around the myths and such i think its even more cool. so when i found all the books together and for a cheap price i was all in.<br /><br /> the package was shipped very nicely- what i mean is they bubble rap, used peanuts and those big rectangle bubble that help absorb the impact if dropped. they really made sure it came i tact.<br /><br />i would recommend this for any kid, teen,or adult that enjoys action from start to finish and first person narrating. the wrighter did a really good job making book flow nicely
1781162646|5.0|King has long been underrated as a writer of quality fiction for some time, in my opinion; especially after I have read some works by other popular writers. My main complaint with his novels has always been that they can tend to go on too long. However, Joyland is a perfect length and is really a great story.<br /><br />As always, King does a great job capturing the thoughts of younger characters and their friendships. There were certainly some aspects that could have been expanded, but the amount of detail felt just right.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the beach amusement park setting and learning a little bit about the carnival culture.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how it is fun for the entire family not just the older kids. plus the kids just love all the mischief! haha
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Heard a lot about this show so I decided to check it out. It's awesome! I'm trying to catch up before the new season.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|i am addicted to this game love love love it easy to get down and is also a good game for my six year old to play
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Accidentally played until I was late for work.<br />Fun game with cool upgrades.<br />I dunno what everyone else is talking about.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is so fun. I love this game because it works your brain. I would recommend this game over and over again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I must say I was never into till I started with Bingo Brits. Its the. most fun I've had in a long time..  Once you get into it. it's. hard to stop I love it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Everytime I go to play, the &#34;buy coins&#34; appears and I cannot get rid of it and I don't want to buy coins so the program won't let me play.  Confusing and ticked off.  It was OK, but now it sucks.
6305090564|4.0|If you like some good SyFy action packed film with a sea monster... this is the film for you to get.  Great FX and story.<br /><br />Enjoy...  and I promise you, you will not be disappointed in buying this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a amazing game I am working on the limited dragon board and the limited charting really is a awesome game
B000G03RJA|5.0|for starters,<br /><br />RIP to you Laura Branigan.<br /><br />Born: July 3, 1957, Brewster, NY<br />Died: August 26, 2004<br /><br />You have a unique and beautiful voice, from your discoie songs to your loves songs, they are all just beautiful.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun and addictive game In highly recommend that you download this app it is amazing What are you waiting for download it
B002PEP4SC|2.0|This is a slow read and not too interesting.  I don't know what i thought it would be but it's very slow...I keep putting it down and everytime I try to go back and read...I fall asleep.  Disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the graphics a lot. Super cool. It's very interactive and interesting. It's fun the whole family can enjoy.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|&#34;Camelot&#34; is truly a masterpiece.  I saw it at the movies when it was released and have been in love with it since.  It also reflects much of the 60's in the way it was filmed, i.e., scenes with flower-children, the free-love atmosphere, etc.  The critics were not kind.  But the emotional impact of Richard Harris' incredible persona was very well placed throughout the entire film.  Vanessa Redgrave was flawless as the Queen as well.  This is a movie that I have viewed more than 50 times.  It is one of the greatest love stories ever filmed.  It is a fantasy that was filmed with a great deal of care and love...and to those critics who poo-pooed the film, it is obvious to me that you have no heart!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Played the full versions on my pc, only wish I could put the one I already paid for on my tablet. Oh well, this one is actually worth buying again if I have to.
076781326X|3.0|This film is loved by so many people.  But to me, the film is just too depressing to enjoy.  I know it was the director's intention to make it a searing drama set to music.  But by the end of the movie, I wanted to fall on my knees and thank God my life is not so dismal.  I saw this film when it first came out in the theatres.  Even at that time I thought the film was poorly photographed...being choppy and not flowing well from scene to scene...and it was not clear, but grainy.  On DVD, it is even grainier than seeing it on the big screen which, to me, is distracting.  I don't think it deserved Best Picture at all.  And I'm sorry, but Mark Lester was horrible as Oliver.  I don't care what anyone says.  The kid could not act or sing.  I saw it on stage and their Oliver was spectacular.  But Mark Lester is a real disappointment.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Loved this book! Not what I thought it would be but still very good. Had a great storyline with interesting characters. I also thought the pictures add an extra touch.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The product worked perfectly + it attach to megasafe charger extremly which make it hard to take it off or fall down
B003VANOFY|1.0|After 1 year of use the usb charge connector inside the headphones breaks because they made the usb connector to long so it freely moves back and forth until it breaks the usb connector inside the headphones. After you have soldered it together a few time the rf usb transmitter starts going bad. If I could back in time I would tell myself not to buy these.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|it is one of the greatest horror movies of all-time.. is combines everything !  If you love horror movies, this one will scare you...  if you don´t like horror movies, don´t see this great movie...
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is simply amazing.  She blows away everyone on TV right now, including Clare Danes in Homeland.  Supporting cast is also quite strong, and the story is well done.  I can't wait for season 2.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great characters. Funny. Very creative storylines. The observers. September. Olivia. Sci-fi at its best. Peter. Walter. And a cow. Wow!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|The more I play this game the more I like it.  The characters are beautifully rendered and the layouts are magnificent.  Kudos to Ensenasoft.
B000002U88|4.0|Even Now, classic rock song, up there with his best.  Again one could buy this cd for that one song and get their money's worth and more.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Love the upgrade system, faster missiles with huge explosions is awesome. Great faotd. Plus I'm getting fifty free repair points for rating the app.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have found this game very addictive and fun. I would like more time to locate the objects as it gets challenging.
B008LUM25M|5.0|Ok the people who are saying the characters are weak or the story is not thought-provoking, I really don't know what book you read! I personally found this book ah-mazing, and I'm not a YA but I still read it since I was looking for something after the Hunger Games (also YA). Some people, like me, may get annoyed at first because no explanation is giving. However, that is what drew me in. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen, and what the whole purpose of everything was. I read this book in 24 hours and immediately bought book #2. I will buy book #3 as well once I'm done. Bravo to Mr. Dashner!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love this game and i play it just about every day.  I rate it a five out of five for its ease of play.  It does lock up on external devices from time to time but not enough to be a hindrance.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the John Mayer of [[ASIN:B0014VPFTA Continuum]]. Paradise Valley doesn't have that bluesy feel, and there are no rock songs to be found. If you're looking for the old sound, you won't find it here.<br /><br />That being said, I have a lot of respect for the way Mayer explores his musical boundaries. His music is never routine and can't be easily classified. While I am first and foremost a blues fan, I am also a fan of the artist John Mayer is. I was pleasantly surprised by this CD. The songs feel introspective and, at times, very personal. Most of the songs are of the soft rock/folk variety, while others venture into old country territory.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised by Who You Love, the song he does with Katy Perry. I have not been a big fan of Perry's music, but her voice shines here. The duo make beautiful music together.<br /><br />In all, this collection of songs is a mellow and captivating listening experience.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Not a bad game overall, I especially like the feature that you don't have to spend money on it to get ahead. Keep it up.
B001MVYUPC|1.0|I know Ghandi was a big figure and now that im older I realize who he was but at the time this movie came out I was bored to death in theatre I even fell asleep zzzzzz ill pass on this film
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No evidently I cannot escape. I tried every computer game option to get through to the next room. Never happened. Not much fun if the level 1 room is this tricky!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This story captures your interest from the start and keeps getting better.  Very well written and the cast is perfect.  I am excited to get the second season when it is out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought the book was better than the movie.Could not put it down,finished it in one day! Love Love Love.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the all,time best movies to watch over and over.<br />So many classic lines, so quotable.<br />Play it over and over, Sam!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Typical Willis action movie. That ain't a bad thing. It has humor and an actual plot. What else do you need in this kind of movie.
0689835604|5.0|Such a cute book for little ones who love to read.  My almost 2 year old loves this book.  She loves pulling back the different pages to see what's behind.  These types of books are really fun!
B0053FANS6|5.0|The first one was Great the Second one Still good then the third they screwed up I mean really changing the mother, and making everything happen in china (I believe) I mean the first two were at least a lil bit believable but this last one No.. with the fountain of youth thing going on. idk still great on the effects. but nothing will ever be better then the first 2
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is the best Hinton game I've ever played!!!! Its like playing the real game really exciting and fun!!
B00EEXST2K|4.0|This movie is great what she went thru with her husband and everything. Cant believe no one tried to help her.  While its not going to win an oscar or any of that it was a well written movie that didn't go off course with details. Amanda Seyfried was amazing as lovelace. Will buy this on DVD.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a super brawl against alians, missiles, and nukes. And you have to shoot them down with you own missiles.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Cameron Diaz, Jude law (drool worthy), Kate winslet, and Jack Black all played wonderful parts. Kinda made me wish I could switch homes on a holiday and see the other side of the world for a few days.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|For those who liked the two previous books, this is a &#34;must&#34; It explains everything, like allways, but is real like life is. You'll be searching for the faces he describes. You'll fall in love like I did!
B009WUBERW|2.0|Overall, this movie provides a birds eye view of yesteryear's  superstars making<br />buffoons out of themselves in a vain attempt to prove to themselves that they still<br />'got it'.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|After watching the first one I thought this was just a mediocre action movie, but the second one proved to be better. Jean Claude Van Damm was a good bad guy and Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, and Arnold were great!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am still reading it. I find the book very absorbing. One of the best books I have read in a long time
B004NOH9LW|1.0|Save your time and money.  Why did Matt Damon agree to do this film; I'll never understand.  Run for your life away from this film.  Again, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are enlightening. I love that Susan Collins captured what it means to know what your fighting for an  who your real enemies are. I appreciate that she shows we can usually rely on our gut feeling but how important it is to listen to others and be willing to relinquish power. To push through.<br /> Never give up. This is a very deeply political book that really made me think. I love those kind of books. We need to be careful and look at all the other wars that have happened in the past. History has a way of repeating itself in stupid and selfish generations. Don't let yourself become stupid and selfish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm just doing this so they may not send me the stupid &quot;please rate US message&quot; all the dang time but it is a really fun game.
044042335X|5.0|great books, every one of them.  reacher is an amazing character and these books are always an interesting read. fast shipment.  thank you.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app turns dollar store earbuds into earbuds that  produce amazing sound quality.I am very pleased with how it works for  everything, not just music. I also like how you can open the app anywhere, you do not need to go to the home screen and click on it. Very pleased.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|The quality of acting and the entertainment level, I think has yet to be matched.  I will be a fan for Life!
0312370849|5.0|This is a great book,  very sad at times but the ending is good. I have recommend this for others to read.
B000002MG0|5.0|This is my favorite REM album and I was so happy to find it on vinyl, since I've reverted back to playing vinyl again. The seller did a perfect job with the timing and condition of the record.
067942850X|5.0|A true life story and  a tragedy for such a talented young man.The author done an outstanding job researching the young mans travels, immediately after college graduation. I was amazed at the people who crossed his path and how they tried to help, but he was an individualist, other wise I will do it my way, but it cost him his life. There is a lesson in this book,regardless as to how talented one feels there is a higher power that still has control over our life.  If you are a parent with teenage age kids  or a grandparent,  communicate with your young people they have some excellent ideas don't blow them off as louser's. give them a chance.
B000MV9026|4.0|I was happy to get this film at this good price.  I will look for more fillms in the future
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is simple but very entertaining. As the levels get challenging you can upgrade your missiles, this makes for a fast pace but fun game.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I can't believe I got into a book in this setting.  But I did, and now I miss my mafia man and the slums of Bombay!  I long read when you need good entertainment for a while.  I took it with me on a vacation to Europe.
B000005J56|5.0|This 1998 Grammy winner was the first and greatest of the traditional Cuban Caf&eacute; recordings to receive worldwide airplay and recognition. It was recorded in 1997 as a result of the vision and enterprise of American guitarist and world-music aficionado Ry Cooder and British music producer Nick Gold, at EGREM Studios in Havana \\"where the equipment was unchanged from the 1950s\\" in just six days.<br /><br />The reputation of BVSC is well-deserved. After 38 years of isolation, most of these Cuban musicians were unknown outside their native land and in their 70s and 80s by the time their music was exposed to a wider audience. The roots of the music are in pre-revolutionary Cuba, notably the Havana social scene of the 1950s, but these salsa rhythms rock with exuberance and a depth of feeling you'll rarely hear anywhere.<br /><br />If you've never heard this, just press `play' and let the strains of the opener `Chan Chan' wash over you for a couple of minutes. It'll have you dancing round the room and you'll be won over!<br /><br />BVSC is one of only two albums in the RS \\"500 greatest albums of all time\\" to be recorded in a non-English-speaking country.<br /><br />Check out the film documentary of the same name which features all the music plus interviews with these amazing musicians and their lives and times in Havana.
B00005JKG7|1.0|The cover shown is the original cover from the dvd that came out in the early 2000s. I ordered and it was the re release with the stupid cover and no special features.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Clever, fun, poignant, well written, well acted and just all-around great.  The subtitles don't detract at all from enjoying the movie.
B003UESJJC|5.0|This film is my favorite movie. The edition is perfect if you want it get this version. The previous version was great had both cuts of the film and alot of special features. This however includes the same features from the old set new features! And both cut of the film with a fantastic digital transfer, perfect! It also includes the fantastic doccumentary heart of darkness witch tells you about the very bad things that happend on set. A must have for film fans, and dvd box set collectors!!!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it was well written. Philippe you did it again. All of your books are page turners. Well done
B0089BSOPA|5.0|A good edition of this fantastic sequel. Scream factory finally brings you a good edition of this classic sequel. Packed with awesome features. If your a fan of this film you need the edition. Great job shout! Factory (or scream factory). 5 stars!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My two granddaughters, age 4, and their aunts age 7-12, all love this app. So do I. They can give each other &quot;gifts&quot;of coins that can be used to buy tack and other horses. Strangers can become friends &amp; see each others horses but can't directly communicate with others through it and identity is completely private. You compete in races, care for horse by feeding it, cleaning the stables, washing the horse, all while earning gems/coins that can purchase clothing, saddles, &amp; other tack, feed, &amp; snacks. It has in-app purchasing that you can set up with a password so not to allow children to purchase without permission. The most expensive horse is a rainbow or purple unicorn for $20 or about 250 gems if you earn that many. It is possible to play without ever purchasing any extras. Whenever you begin, click on person icon in upper left corner to set up profile, can choose own nickname, and horse's name. When you compete the higher your presentation score, the higher your final ranking in competition so purchasing some clothing and tack does allow for more earnings to be won. The mini-games allow horse to earn health and love points which a minimum is needed in order to compete. Feeding food/snacks also earns health/love. It does a good job of simulating what it takes to care for animal. Also, teaches work ethic, value of earnings in order to purchase necessities. I personally like playing the game myself, too. Suitable for age 2, with some assistance, children, teens, and adults. Can be used as incentive for good behavior by purchasing things for horses or buying new horse for it.<br /><br />Their customer service is excellent. The only time I had a problem, they responded within 24 hours, and when problem couldn't be resolved, they replaced everything we had purchased and restored game level on new identity by giving us huge amount of coins/gems. Their customer service is better than any app, game, or utility, or store, that I've ever used.
B0001VTPWM|3.0|The set is very nice, thy obviously put some effort into it. The films the original is one of the greatest action films ever made. The second film underrated movie. Third sucked. The DVDs if you want the original go for the 20th anniversary edition. The sequels if your want them this is the way because there is no other edition that has special features.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My two small grandsons love this game.  It is just as much fun for me and it is very good for hand eye cordination.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It was very disappointing. Glad it was free. Deleted it as soon as I downloaded. Wish you could get the game candy crush on my kindle hd
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really cool. Get it.<br />I want my gems now plz poo doo do I give me my gems Santos in the house
0345803485|5.0|Many seem to think that &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey is violent and while there were two uncomfortably violent serssions, these two people were lovers and that came through in every chapter--give or take--. For me it was a &#34;page turner&#34; and I'm looking forward to the next sequel.<br /><br />Jacquelyn Schilling
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Although this was quite good, I didn't find it as hard to put down. The Kite Runner remains one of my favorites.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book, written from a dog's perspective, is at once heart-warming and heart-wrenching. It causes you to laugh and to cry. While some find it trite, I simply loved it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Thought that the $79 price was a little steep but When I received it, I couldn't stop watching it.  Absolutely hilarious.  The price paid was well worth it!  Highly recommend it.
0985557834|5.0|J.D. has written another great text. I don't know him personally, but through his website and YouTube channel, I am sure that he would give credit to others. J.D. is a true teacher. His texts provide clear and accurate information on tying Paracord into unique and new knots. The pictures provide great instruction along with clear and concise step-by-step written instruction.  Novice, intermediate, and advanced knot enthusiasts will enjoy JD's latest edition. I highly recommend this book in addition to his other two volumes on Paracord knotting. I look forward to new knots and hopefully, another volume of Paracord Fusion Ties.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a good game I like it<br />It's a little hard in level four but it's just fun and I like it alot
0788859544|5.0|Good condition and it is still the invaluable proof of how cartoon movies used to show the mastery of real cartoonist and not only computer savvy people's work.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fairly basic version of missile defense. Intuitive and easy. Great way to burn a little time without being sucked into for too long.
0307454568|5.0|I HAVE MY WIFE READING THE SET NOW.  THE BOOKS WERE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, TOO BAD STEIG HAS PASSED ON.
B003L77G38|5.0|Off beat with interesting characters. This completed my collection of the Fringe series. When we don't know what to watch or dont like what is being broadcast, we just reach for Fringe.
0307949508|5.0|I HAVE MY WIFE READING THE SET NOW.  THE BOOKS WERE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, TOO BAD STEIG HAS PASSED ON.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|great series that keeps you wondering &#34;who did it&#34; all through out the series. Well acted and interesting to watch
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this is a great game and it teaches kids the responsibility of having a pet.<br />I do wish that you didn't have to buy treats though,otherwise this is a great game
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Thus game reminds me of the iron dome missle defense for Israel.  Very creative anf simple.  Nice pass rimw while waiting for a tow truck or inline atan office.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Not  very funny.  Not very believable.  And the Grand Canyon is boring?  What a stupid stupid movie!  Don't bother, seriously!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|My sister really liked it. this was her second time watching it.  If you like to watch diplomatic movies, it is probably pretty good.  Too dry for me.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Fun video where the bad guy gets sick of being the bad guy.  Old video game versus new technology with a sweet story.  This middle-aged viewer loves kids movies and this one was great.  Jane Lynch stole the show.  Watch for her killer voice over and the wonderful graphics for her character.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|loved the book, I wish I had more to read, I cant wait for the next book. So please hurry up with the 4 book.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm not sure how I stumbled across this book but it more realistically embodies what is happening inside your head when someone you love is dying than anything other than what is inside my own actual head. Also, it is late and makes you stay up until 3am, laughing and crying to finish it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I just downloaded this game and I'm playing it and so far it's fun I k n ow my 6year old will like it
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|We loved the documentary, the story and the music. It was well written and directed. Good job to all involved in this film.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|It has all their best songs in one great package. If you like the band get it. If you don't, don't.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The instructions don,t explain what to do. merely says solve the puzzle but not how. I don't know why there are so many positive reviews.  I must be missing something. I deleted it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really love this game it is very entertaining I just wish it gave you more time when the last number is called soon as its called it blocks you from clicking on the number other then that issue I find bingo blitz OUTSTANDING!!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Over all it is a decent classic atari remake. Runs smoothly but game could use better sound and sprites and maybe some bonus levels
B00AFEY354|5.0|My boys were bugging me to get this just from watching the previews....  Once we got it - It was watched over and over again.  It was definitely worth the purchase
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great classic game. Game play is smooth and so much fun to play. Works great on my SGS3 and on my G Slate tab.
0783240236|5.0|Being such a huge fan of his movies, I had to have this one .........  I felt fortunate to be able to purchase one of the last few available, and wasn't disappointed at all - I'm just concerned that I'm going to wear it out and not be able to replace it since it's being watched on a regular basis.  LOL.  Thank You
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Awesome to draw on and transfer to evernote. Really fun to draw with different lines or circles. Also the speach  bubbles are helpful.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We can now see shows in parts of the house where we don't have DVD or other device.  The three free months of Netflix (even if you are an existing customer) is more than the $35 price of Chromecast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|swet.  best game ever I love it its mincraft but with out a computer its the best game ever and its grate
B007PJFIU6|5.0|We play this with grandkids, including a five year old.  The five year old frequently beats the adults at this game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Haha this game is addicting and fun! A good game to pass the time with, and get your heart rate up lol
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good hand eye cord and easy upgrades make you keep playing I like the amount of missiles you can get
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This is a OK game. The graphics are pretty simple but the game play is pretty straight forward.  It's ok for a free game but I don't think I would have been happy if I had paid for it.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Wonderful series which deserved far more critical acclaim. Usually the main characters capture our attention, but this is so well written and well acted even the minor characters are fascinating.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Definitely an upgrade from the old Atari version. Good time waster. Will waste countless hours having fun on this game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very good game, lots of fun. Graphics are simple, but well done. Ran great on my android tablet. Will be playing much more of this game.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Some of my friends recommended Pinterest to me.  It just isn't my type of thing to do.  I would much rather play Words with Friends, Scrabble, or Bingo Blitz.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is okay so far. It seems like there are not enough repair points offered each round. We will see.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Both products are Android based.  It is easy to search on either one using Google CSE.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B008476HBM|5.0|15 years ago I first picked up this book. Now I try to read it every year around my birthday and it is by far my favourite book of all time. The character are so well written and you find yourself become part of their world. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this game and play it several times daily.  It is easy to learn and a lot of fun.  I'm still trying to fill my first country (LONDON).....I need one more item to complete it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy and fun.  Good game.  Takes only a little practice but u can easily get t he hang of it.  Nicely done guys.  :-D
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book gave me an insight into the world of a trained killer.I can't imagine what it would be like to kill hundreds of people.Very interesting in that the sniper wholly justified all those kills.
0425266060|4.0|I loved the story and read all 3 books within a short time...I can't wait for book #4 to release...the only problem I had with the books was that the 2nd book fell apart after I opened it!!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Very good documentary with footage of rare songs from the beginning. Lots of information and interviews with friends, family, and other people from his life. If you love this artist, this is a must see! There are subtitles if you need help with patois.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It seems it pretty rear modern non-violent movie. Will see...Yes, we saw this movie. and it is rear modern philosophic movie.

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I wouldn't know how to cut a bottle if it weren't for this wonderful contraption.  I feel safe using it, too.  thanks.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Everville: The First Pillar by Roy Huff is a wonderful YA fantasy full of great battles, rich scenery and incredible fantasy creatures. He has perfectly created an unforgettable protagonist in Owen Sage, college freshman and if this ever became a movie we would have a beloved star to fill an older Harry Potter's shoes.<br />Owen Sage knows he's different, for when he falls asleep he is transported to Everville a wondrous land under threat from evil creatures Them. He comes under the guidance of the Keeper, leader of the friendly race Fron and so begins Owen's fantastic journey from meek teenager to mighty warrior and saviour of Everville. There is so much going for this book - the reader is dragged straight into the action with no fuss or tedious back story - the characters are so likeable we immediately root for them - the story is full of immense action scenes and unusual surprises, even back on Earth we gasp at Roy Huff's brilliant twists and continuation of the plot.<br />This is a superb kickstarter to a great series. Bring it on Roy Huff.<br />This is a FIVE STAR fantasy novel begging not only to be read but snapped up by Hollywood.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It was working really good until the update installed and now it just says it won't connect  to server..... please fix it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Thought that I would try it has a free app. Turned out to be great. Fun way to kill time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is lots of fun to play! If you like alien space craft and shooting things down then this is the game for you!
B0053KWDES|2.0|The product is smaller than I thought and this is my first time to use a headphone amp, so I cannot compare it with other portable headphone amplifiers. It does its work and the sound quality improved. But the battery only last around an hour and a half. I followed the instructed and charged it to full and it still only last such a short time. I don't know how can I used it as a portable headphone amp if it only last an hour and a half? And you cannot use it when you are charging it, which is a little annoying when you are enjoy music and it interrupted by out of battery of your headphone amp... I will send it back.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Fantastic book!  Kept interest all the way through.  Could not put it down for a moment!<br />Love, love, loved it.
B009O2XY12|1.0|New update causes the game to get stuck.  Each time I start a new level for the first time, I lose a turn because the game stops.  This is causing me to lose time and MONEY.  Do not update your game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys English programs.  A moving and exciting drama.  I enjoy all the actors in this drama and am awaiting the next season.  Hurry!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not bad reminds me of most of the FB HO games but is fun.  Only problem I'd some of the objects are hard to see on the kindle.
B002N14GPE|4.0|We liked this movie...Very good acting by leading lady...(not the orphan) but she was good too.  We mean the woman that played in &#34;the conjuring&#34;.  Anyway, this flick woulda got 5 stars except for it was much too predictable.  Otherwise good movie.  The little girl with the curls was just adorable.  Leading man, not a great actor by any stretch, the little boy that played the son, they could of found a better actor.  All in all though.  4 stars!  Watch it.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|The conversion from web series to dvd was seamless and this pleased my and my partner. i am glad i bought this. it even has a holofoil; 3d cover.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun stuff.  An awesome retro tribute. Fans of galaga asteroids and the like will be pleased. Plays very smooth on my HTC one.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|The physical copy of Portal 2:songs to test by is awesome, the disk faces are the personality cores and the fourth disk is the portal 1 soundtrack. another perk is that, while you can get the track free from valve, the tracks are available on amazon cloud player so you can play them from anywhere which makes things a lot more convenient. The set comes with codes for free tf2 and dota 2 items as well. Over all these are a must have for any portal fan.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Such a classic movie. Loved the characters, their roles, the dancing.<br />Would watch it again & even learn dance myself with it!
B009AMANBA|2.0|The only thing I have to add is that I liked the 1988 movie Lincoln, with Sam Waterson and written by Gore Vidal, one heck of a lot more.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty fun!  Simple concept, but the arcade game style makes it fun to play.  I'd recommend  this game, although I purchased it when it was the free app of the day.
B002RUA524|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all.... in fact it is one of very few I did not finish.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun but easy to run out of energy so if u like building destroying and transportatation,l this is ur game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've been playing this game since I got my kindle at Christmas addictive & fun to play & best of all its free
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game.  I play much better here than at the arcades! It was recently updated and it's even better!
B000J233SK|4.0|I like this CD because its easy to listen to. I listen to it when I want to relax. I would recommend it to anyone that likes earthy music, it is definately not for someone who likes only heavy music like R&B or Rock and roll.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|The book kept my attention.  I felt that it became predictable with the killer and the results were the same.  Otherwise I did enjoy the book.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I bought this as deal of the day for $20.  Everyone that is a fan of the scifi genre needs Alien and Aliens, they are must owns.  The rest is just filler.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show. Not sure why I didnt watch it when it was on tv beginning with season 1 but I love it! Great cast! Very entertaining storylines. I have it on my kendel and watch it every morning while I walk on the treadmil.It is so good I dont realize how long i have been walking! Love it!!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great time killer and fun.  Puts me in mind of missiles command on atari. Good old arcade fun, not too complex
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Very successful reboot of everybody's favorite secret agent. Looks stunning in Blu-Ray. Do not miss this if you are a fan of the series, or if you just like good action movies. The title song is very good too.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Customizing the character has a lot of options. Tons of action, upgrades. Doesn't get old. An app worth the money.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse. I was skeptical because I had never heard of the brand before, but after using it for numerous gaming sessions I can safely say there is no need to spend $100+ on some of these other gaming mice. Its contours to my hand great, and the extra buttons are a nice addition.
B004EWFUQY|3.0|I liked the concept but the foods did not agree with me. I have friends that the diet works very well for but just no for me.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Lots of fun! Grate for 5 years and up. I loved it. The reason I only gave it a 4 star is because it's not so addicting. And those ars good to. But other than that it's so fun!
0345529057|5.0|For it's cheap price of $20, it's an absolute bargain. The books are much more in depth and when combined with watching the HBO series, the whole thing really comes to life.
B00138D320|5.0|Nothing but get your butt up and start moving. Feel good music if I ever heard it. Can't help but love it.<br />I have Headhunters, I will own this.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Those of us who were in the military remember the way armed forces were treated when they returned from Vietnam.  Soldiers went where they were told to go, did what was expected of them and participated in a conflict that our government told them to pursue.  The men and women did not need the negative feedback they received in those trying years.  This movie portrayed a portion of the lives of ordinary people, asked to do extraordinary things in the name of their country.  It was a shame that most of our country could not value the work these soldiers completed at that time.  I thought the movie fairly represented what was going on at that time; we completely felt the sorrow as the wife made her many trips to her friends homes with the telegrams.  It hit home once again.  Two of our sons were in the military and one is still there after 24 years.  Our country needs to support their troops...one of these people could have been your child.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a brilliant and realistic a great experience for children no matter what your into this a game tor everyone
B000ZN802W|5.0|Love this film, it's a masterpiece definitely worth seeing.The music is great as well. Simply a lovely film to watch when you want to re-inspire yourself.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great little sharpener for the price. This product sharpened my dull knife up pretty well. When using this sharpener be sure to press down on the blade firmly through the sharpener to get a nice sharp edge.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Quick, fun and easy to play. Reminds me of the original. It is a good game to make time go by faster while waiting anywhere.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love it very cool dam and boom and pow and boom nice you rock well worth it I'm hungry and boom Nice
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great read even if your marriage is great.  It's an excellent conversation starter.  I feel fortunate to have read it so early in our marriage.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I got this as a free app.  I have enjoyed this program very much. The game is very challenging and fun.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 3year old, 5year old, and 16 year old all play this and love it.  Fun and easy to use, very dynamic and interactive!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Last week, Withings' servers went down, meaning every single Withings baby monitor out there stopped working. There was no message on Withing's Twitter account until hours later, and their site was down too. Even when the servers work, the baby monitor has a several second delay. The iPhone app behaves in a bizarre way with alerts sometimes coming in even after they're disabled. If you leave the app running, your battery will quickly drain. Almost every night, we lose the connection to the server and have come to rely on hearing the baby down the hall, not on the monitor.<br /><br />It sounds appealing to be able to monitor the baby even when you're not at home, but I would gladly sacrifice this feature for a local wireless connection that actually worked.
1451673442|5.0|I'm a big fan of these books.. The Magic just added to my smiles each day in recognizing my gratitude more towards thing... Very happy with this purchase...
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|So far, the battery life is only lasting me a couple days, not the two weeks as listed on the box. I thought maaaaybe it was because I was \\"overusing\\" it checking my pulse and fiddling with the various screens, but I suspect maybe I just have a bad battery...<br /><br />The features make my original FitBit look like a total joke, and it seems like it may hold up better to \\"everyday\\" levels of sweat/moisture.<br /><br />I've been in pole climbing (telephone poles) class all week, and it didn't seem to register the \\"steps\\", caloric burn, and altitudinal changes very well for that activity - but it's pretty spot-on for walking/running.<br /><br />I still haven't noticed it doing an automatic (non-manual) sync of data, but I'm gonna spend the next few days not touching it except to note sleep/wake times just to see how long the battery lasts with minimal interaction.<br /><br />Overall, works as advertised, and for someone who is interested in tracking activity, it looks like a great option for normal exercise routines.<br /><br />Also, the new Withings website is pretty good, though  it forced me to use the old version to fiddling with the wifi settings on my Withings scale when it lost signal. Anyway, I highly recommend this product, so long as you get one with a good battery!
0321857895|5.0|Such a great book! I read it faster than I expected and have been using it as an undergrad. Then passed it off to my best friend in grad school who is also loving it and finding it very relatable.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|.Find is fun fast little game. Playing on Kindle Fire 8.9 no sign of malware yet. It is very similar to the old missile command
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book this afternoon, the whole thing...it has received outstanding reviews and what criticism I have read so far has been unrelated to the actual story (print copy complaints), extremists who believe that children like this should never be put in public school, and that it has too rosy of an ending...yes it's a feel good tale, but much like real life the characters have to travel through some mud to get there. Wonder approaches the real human side of caring unconditionally for someone who is different. It's not a walk in the park...the best people get tired and worn out and think completely human what-if type thoughts...and then beat themselves up more than anyone because they feel weak and like they are not good people.<br /><br />This book is written from the perspective of the boy and members of his family, friends, and friends of friends...some interesting styling choices were clearly made relevant to the character they represented (ie. the sisters boyfriend's chapter is in all lower case), but once you adjust your thoughts to the person you are reading it's logical and helps you relate. I may be biased because I have some special people in my life, but in the first 5% of this book I was already chuckling, crying, and fairly invested...I recommend it as a resource for opening conversations about #bullying, #acceptance, #tolerance, #difference, #empathy
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|Excellent, emotional acting that placed me right in the middle of everything...fast paced.. to the point.. lots of excellent special effects. congrats to the team for putting together a fine sub/military movie!  Right up there with the best sub movies.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is exciting and it keeps you holding on to find out what is coming next! Can wait to see what's next
B004J4XGN6|2.0|I was really amazed that this book got any good reviews.  I read a lot of business books and this is simply not very well written.  In addition to being written poorly, the content is not original and feels like simple regurgitation from other better books.<br /><br />I did find a good book from the foot notes and switched to reading it...
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|(Spoilers ahead. If you've never read this, read it even if you're not a fan of love stories!) What I love about this story is the redemption both Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot get after 8 years of separation. They both were consistent and were what the other needed. It's a beautiful love story. I love the way Jane Austen takes the reader through Anne's feelings in such a mature way. I think many modern authors could learn a thing or two by reading this book.
B00C7LB20C|2.0|Don't believe the trailer!  A wanna be Borne movie, weak and frustrating.  I really wanted to like this movie... It had a lot of potential and some of the acting was pretty good.  The daughter role was WAY over played and the Director has a distorted idea of what the audience wants to see.<br /><br />If you are going to try to copy a mainstream movie.... at least copy the best aspects of it!! I wish I could have my time and money back.<br /><br />Tony
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|It is akin to opera+pop. His voice is flawless and romantic, even though I cannot understand a word of Italian or other languages, except English. I am going to purchase some of his other CDs.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|After reading the book, I loved seeing the movie. Julianne Hough was very good.<br />It was a great love story.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is very very fun and very entertaining I play it almost every single day<br />I'm like addicted to playing it
B0057UAE54|5.0|sounds just like it did when it came out years ago, good made me feel so much younger.  good bye
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This band got off to a great start a little while back, and when I got my hands and my eyes and my ears onto this album I was floored again. The title song is driving, wonderful, potent, and makes me wish I could be out there to see this oh so tight band play and sing. The album has great variety and pacing, and not a thing misses its mark for me. I don't write music reviews - this is my first - but I listen closely, and I respond very well to music that manages like this to fuse its passion with its professionalism and its feeling of a loving family doing what they celebrate. Do I Look Worried keeps building its insistent triple pulse all the way to the end; Idle Wind shifts into a wistful feeling; enough from me. This is a fine collection of original, attractive, and heartfelt music pieces. Check it out for yourselves.
B00C1TOTK0|2.0|My favorite movie but I'll keep the old DVD.  This one had all the nighttime scenes so dark that only because I knew the film could I see what was going on.  And the final scene, with Joey calling after Shane--it conked out!  The disc went in the trash.
B004EF8AJA|4.0|The book is great fun.  Much is left out in the video, and some liberties are taken, but it's interesting to make the comparisons.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|If the first Kick-Ass movie was your kind of thing, Kick-Ass 2 more than delivers. The first film was more unique and original, but this one gives you even more laughs and great performances by Chloe Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey.<br /><br />Hit-Girl still rules and it was fun seeing a much larger cast of good and bad characters. Carrey is not in the movie for very long, but he sheds his goofy facial expressions for a realistic and believable tough guy role. He should do more stuff like this. McLovin is much better here this time around and goes from Red Mist to the supervillain with a name I can't repeat here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is once again good as Kick-Ass, but he spends most of the time (like the first movie) just getting beat up.<br /><br />The violence is a little extreme, but I was expecting more given that Jim Carrey is now against the film due to this fact. Yes it has flaws, but it is a fun ride that had me smiling throughout. Oh, stay after the end credits for a short but important scene.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, well acted, and visually stimulating! It's funny but this show is tied for my top choice with Sons of Anarchy.  Doesn't seem to make much sense, but there it is.
B001NLL93W|5.0|So far in the series.. this one is my fave.<br /><br />There are a lot of predictable parts, but you know what, it didn't bother me for some reason. I still enjoyed seeing how Clare was going to unravel all the details.<br /><br />Plus, I was happy to see the things I suspected were actually right. Thank goodness.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure where this series goes from here. The end of the book tied up quite neatly, but I'll come back to the 4th book in the series at some point in time.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Killswitch Engage have been one of my favorite bands for a long time now and I have loved most of what they have done..... Howards' last record was so disappointing and bland, but I forgive him because he was going thru more than we can imagine at the time. After his departure, in steps the man that helped build this monster Jesse Leach. KSE sounds whole again and they sound like they're having fun. This cd, first song to last screams KSE... It is truly an epic album to be a metalcore release. KSE has always stood out from the metalcore crowd for me and this album is no different. The passion of Jesse's voice is so apparent and his lyrics are top notch. The rhythm section here is as always pummeling and tight with some killer grooves. The guitars are brutal yet beautiful with the 2 guys playing to their strong points. The chemistry between Adam D and Joel makes KSE the band they are. What else can be said except this album is not just another Metalcore release, it is a METAL album that needs to be heard by fans of heavy music. Howard fans, get over yourselves, and Jesse fans, you get over yourselves too. Just be thankful that the band is still going and we have this awesome material to bang our heads to\m/
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|We love the Die Hard series in general, but this one we could have missed.<br /><br />We knew from the reviews that this was going to be an 'over the top' action film, but the action sequences are so long, with so few breaks they actually get pretty tedious.  I found myself going to the kitchen to gt a drink while things were blowing up, because things just kept blowing up.<br /><br />There are a few pretty original action sequences that were really cool - the side of a building rigged to blow as part of an escape route, driving OVER cars sideways in a traffic jam - and Willis and his 'son' both do  great job delivering fully developed characters you believe in, but since they're so busy blowing things up and avoiding getting killed, you don't get hang out with them at all - which is too bad.<br /><br />So, if you love Bruce Willis, watch Fifth Element (Willis & Mila J) and 13 Monkeys (Willis & Brad Pitt), or Die Hard 1 and 2 which are truly great movies...  and you can watch this too.. if you want.
B009R6GN22|4.0|Having just read THE PRECIOUS FEW DAYS about the final year of Jack and Jackie Kennedy, I became interested in the relationship (if there was one) of Jack with Marilyn Monroe. Spoto's book provides background on her sad childhood, the making of a star, and the beginning of the downfall as Marilyn uses more and more drugs. Throughout the book, the author's sympathy and admiration for Marilyn are apparent. It is as if he hopes to dispel the common belief of \\"dumb blond\\" and sex kitten.<br /><br />An interesting look at an iconic American superstar, make that superstar with issues. So much of this reminded me of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Recommended read.
1568363931|5.0|I think this is one of the best books in English for finding great ideas for Bento Box Lunches.  Thank you Makiko Itoh!
B000026OW3|5.0|It's Rubenstein! Very few contemporary performers are in his class.<br /><br />Also, it's a wonderful introduction to Chopin's entire body of work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|omg this is so fun.....play it play it sooooocooool this is the most fun game ever next to.fruit ninja and jetpack joyride...lol so.fun
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|If you've ever read a story written by a child, the plot may be disjointed and murky.  That's what this movie is like.  Well, they had some new top-secret photon torpedoes they were going to fire at a bad guy. But when they looked there were people in the torpedoes! I guess sometimes that happens.  Seriously, I've always liked the StarTrek series and, other that the plot, this movie wasn't that awful.  It's just that you will probably be disappointed, even with real low expectations.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the original three Lord of the Rings movies, and really enjoyed this first installment of The Hobbit.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun I play it all the time. I spend hours on it. The game is super interesting to play the game on it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game and I also like the fact that you have different versions to play. I would suggest this to anyone who loves mahjong.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really like this game. It's very fun and there are a lot of different animals you get to rescue.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game.  The game can be frustrating at times but if you like mind games and are patient. you will enjoy this app.
B0041KVZ1I|1.0|anticipated the arrival of the album only to find that side b was BADLY warped..unplayable on my vpi scout tt. So I ordered another and planned to return the first one...same thing...warped, though not to the extent of the first lp...but enough to cause fluttering when listening...<br /><br />so with 2 warped lps, I decided not to buy it..and just get a refund...<br /><br />does this mean that all lps of Abbey Road remastered is like this?
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Not the best of the Die Hard movies, but I still enjoyed it.  I do think tho that its time for McClain to retire!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very fun and do not have to buy anything extra is a bonus. Reminds me of the old arcade game.
B002361MLA|5.0|Truly life changing book! Really helped me understand myself and those around me. I would highly recommend this book to others.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this help guide is only for specific levels. it is not for all levels. level assistance provided is sporatic and not consistant.  not worth the time to download.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This a great game in the fact that you use missiles to destroy other missiles.Except that I think they should add more upgrades. Today's the free app of the day by th he way
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Reading this has really made me feel sorry for him and what metallic did. Margaret is a great band I enjoyed listening to them all these years!
B00BMTX2QM|4.0|Cathedral have been threatening swan song so long that its still hard for me to believe this is it, especially when Dorrian's said in interviews that they recorded practically another album's worth of material that didn't make the cut for this one. But, as the band is calling this the final proper album, I'll treat it as such.    Cathedral have long been an enigma. They're certainly held up as a cornerstone of doom, but also have split fans of the genre with their gratuitous prog, funk, and even folk experimentation, not to mention nearly turning into a southern rock White Zombie with their 4th and 5th albums, Supernatural Birth Machine and Caravan Beyond Redemption. Now we have The Last Spire, an album the band is calling the follow-up to its almost unbearably heavy debut, Forest Of Equilibrium. \\"Its like we made our second album last,\\" as Dorrian puts it.    Its not that. Its the most straightforward doom album they've done since Endtyme, for sure, and its focus is welcome after the psych-prog freakout of their last album, Guessing Game, but the weirdness of the intervening years still creeps in often, via mellotron, synth, and the occasional burbling brook. Plus Lee Dorrian comes nowhere close to re-creating the singular death-moan vocals of Forest. The Last Spire has Equilibrium's massive, dark, bizarre trees, but not its desolate forest. You really can't go home again.    A major difference between this album and the last few lies in the production. The band has gone for a snarly, almost Entombed buzzsaw sound, effectively abandoning the Sabbath-esque guitar/bass interplay they've done so well for so long. The main reason for this is the unexplained absence of longtime bassist Leo Smee, a fantastic player who for whatever reason did not participate in this final outing. I miss him; Scott Carlson is solid, but a completely different animal, playing with a pick through grinding scooped-mid distortion with nary a fill or deviation. Where Smee, in conjunction withdrummer Brian Dixon, had moments of bonafide swing, Carlson is all plod. I really would like to know why Smee was left out, as one of the hallmarks of Cathedral's sound was how well he and Jennings were matched tonally.    Speaking of Jennings, he is in fine form here, churning out the endless sludge riffs and soloing to beat the devil. Watching him develop into such a wicked post-Iommi lead player has been a lot of fun, and he definitely brings it like he means it here, with his impossibly downtuned ideas veering between demon blues and angular, abrupt pitch changes that give Lee Dorrian the latitude to be the singer he is. Dorrian's vocals are, well, Dorrian. From Napalm Death to the occasional pseudo-Ozzy, Lee's throat's had quite the journey. He is thankfully more aggressive here than on the last album, where he really seemed to be trying to be a straightforward singer, something he just doesn't quite have the tone (or pitch control) for. I would still like to have heard more grit from him in places, but at least he's not overdoing the clean thing.    I mentioned at the beginning that Cathedral has been threatening swan song for awhile. Their 2005 masterpiece, Garden Of Unearthly Delights, was supposed to be their last. That would've seen them out on the highest of possible notes--that record rivals even Ethereal Mirror--but these last two albums haven't done them any harm. The way I'm talking, I sound ambivalent, but I'm actually enjoying The Last Spire a great deal. I suppose my main quibble would be how comfortable it is. I'm not quite sure what to do when this band isn't confounding me at every turn, and, strange as it sounds, I sort of miss it.    Cathedral damn near single-handedly rebooted doom in the early 90s, picking up where Trouble left off with The Skull, or, in a sense, where Sabbath was at Vol. 4. They've survived early disinterest, an ill-fated major label brush, and 20 years of being just popular enough to keep going but not to really make a living. They've done it for the love, and a select rabid few have loved them for it. Hopefully time will see their legend grow, as it did with the likes of Trouble and Pentagram, years down the road. They'll be missed, but there's solace in the fact that their catalog is deep and rewards multiple listens. They are gone, and they are forever. If that ain't equilibrium, I don't know what is.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Didn't clear out the &#34;had watched&#34; videos and loaded SILVER LININGS unwittingly thinking I hadn't seen it. It took 10 minutes into the movie to recognize I had already seen it. Strictly a movie accoring to individual preferences...but definitely NOT a great movie. Save it for when you can't find anything better.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Seems kinda easy after a while but its a pretty fun game.  Maybe if they made it a bit harder it would be better
B00785P2QC|4.0|it's fun, don't like pop ups to buy investment points. would like to get more investment points while playing the game
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was to long and very repetitive. She should have cut down on the number of characters--they were hard to sort out and mostly unlikeable.  It seemed uniformed about the social situations she was trying to high-light.  This might have been a good read if the publisher had not been so anxious to gain from her famous name.  I have no doubt that she has sold many books but I don't think this book was of a quality that she should be very proud of.  I advise her and her editors to take more care next time out.
B00650SSDU|5.0|Wasn't sure this would be something I like.  I don't remember this getting all that much buzz at the box office, but this is a really great romantic comedy.  Mila and justin have great on screen chemistry and she is just adorable.  Very good date movie.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and appreciate the details as well as self awareness brought by this author. A look inside a place that is so unfamiliar to so many but made relatable from a woman's perspective.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I find this show highly addicting.  I think the actors do a superb job of living and breathing their characters.  I find myself compelled to stay up and watch more than one episode at a time (instead of going to sleep, as I should!).  It's the type of show where you think about the plot twists and people even when you're not watching.  I love the historical aspects, the costumes, the accents....everything.  Perhaps I'm a bit of an Anglophile, but still.  It's an all around great show, one of the few that my husband and I enjoy watching together; my parents have the same experience - so it's great for all generations and genders!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|its good but don't get enough coins for each round. also a lot of them are difficult even for level one
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story keeps you guessing whether or not the husband really did murder his wife or not. The ending sure takes a psychotic turn.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favorite game of all. This is not just my favorite bingo game,  but my favorite bingo game, and my favorite game of all.
034580404X|5.0|I would have gone crazy knowing that I finished only one book and didn't buy the other two. I would have hated for the story to continue. I say buy all three so you don't have to wait.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|anyone who puts 1star is crazy this is an amazing game I love rovio entertainment so if anyone puts one star .... go to a mental hospital. JK.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I recently discovered James Altucher's blog through twitter, which led me to this book. It really made me think, and I thoroughly enjoyed the read, in between laughs.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Can't get enough of the fun fun fun. I love love these types of games. Decent story. Great time wasters!!
B0052U6HYG|5.0|I have problems with my feet and these shoes are great! They are so comfortable and I can wear them all day and have no issues!! Just love them!!!!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|First, the positives:<br />1. It's refreshing to see the world from a completely different point of view.<br />2. The characters are realistic and you truly care for Jack and his mother.<br /><br />Now, the negatives:<br />1. It was hard to get used to the 5 yr old pov. Albeit annoying for the first 20 pages, you get over it and just enjoy the pov of this very clever and perceptive character.<br />2. Into the last act, the story becomes slow (and this is a short book). I was happy that the ending came as suddenly as it did.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a good time waster. The difficulty seems to go up too fast but otherwise fun. Either a slower progression of level difficulty or slightly cheaper upgrades would improve the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is ubertastic it will entertain my brothers for hours and hours. It is soooooo addicting!!! My rating for it is 5 stars!!!! :)
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Very nice cd from one of my favorite bands. First listened to them in the early 70's...still love the band!
B005LAIISA|5.0|I love all these movies, they are great for family movie night or to just watch when you want a good laugh.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good source I can go to it at any time it is much faster but I still like the old fashion way of reading the bible
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.  Scenery, acting and music all do a fantastic job of making Pileggi's book come to life.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like how detailed this game is. You need to ship product from one location to another. And it's pretty similar to real life stuff.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Not a seamless addition to the alarm that was part of the original OS, but it adds features like wake to music and generally make the Alarm feature of the OS a much more friendly tool.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|really good music and a twist in the ending really recomend this movie if you like repo man the generic opera
B007VGXS8M|4.0|I loved these books from when i was young and this is almost the exact same. brings back fond memories. :)
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Paradise Valley in another very good, and once again different, CD from John Mayer.  Great music, lyrics and production.  But I keep hoping for a no holds barred guitar CD from one of the best blues/rock/yes,even country guitarists out there.  Watch any of his YouTube concert videos or special appearance videos to see what I mean.  How about a CD with a live vibe featuring a few guest guitarists.  I want some loud, some big-time energy, and most of all, some of John's special guitar that's out in front for a change.  Paradise Valley is very good. Now I'm ready for a change in the \\"guitar direction.\\"
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not a terrible game by any stretch. You can get the \\"real\\" Missile Command, but it's sometimes fun to see newer interpretations of classics. As for malware, no idea. I never got a warning when I had it at that time. I uninstalled it shortly after I got it anyway. The novelty kind of wore of for me pretty quickly and I just got annoyed way too much. I wasn't a huge fan of Missile Command back in the Atari days and broke a couple of controllers out of frustration. So I guess they did a good job of capturing the gameplay of the original in that respect.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I'm pleased to know the \\"tv\\" version of Nikki Heat \\" Kate Beckett\\" has alot more class than the book version. And the tv version doesn't have all the unneeded foul language.<br />It was a good read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally!  This game plays as well on the touch screen as it does on the PC.  Can't wait for Plants vs Zombies 2 to be released for Android.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Updated graphics, repairs &amp; upgrades, and clever additions to the classic Atari game &quot;Missile Command.&quot; If you liked the original, you'll enjoy this remake.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the movie, so this game already had a leg up for a good rating from me, but the game actually is pretty fun and a little challenging.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud and cry at the same time. It was beautifully written. I though the characters were so believable. I would highly recommend this book for high school age (some sexual content might not be appropriate for younger ages) or adults looking for a fairly quick but fabulous read!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Really fun game you better get if you want to have fun.  Always has be fun since the second I got it.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I am enjoying playing it. It is large enough that i can see it with no trouble.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Makes my tablet into something that can access big boy documents and not just be a kid's toy.  If you use microsoft office, this gives you the ability to use your files on your android tablet.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I expected 'awe factor' or at least 'wow factor' from this book expecting someone who fought against the undead tells me the horrible but very detailed unusual story that I cannot possibly imagine.<br /><br />Unlike the movie 'Cloverfield' where the main story is very common but teller's viewpoint is completely new so I could feel those exciting factors, 'World War Z' failed to deliver that experience even though the teller's viewpoint cannot be closer.<br /><br />This book is about people telling their stories about fighting against zombies and there is no such a thing that we normally expect from reading a novel as foreshadow, probability, climax,  ample amount of cause-and-effect that penetrates the whole story or any type of twist.<br /><br />This is a bundle of several zombie fighting stories and you cannot be wrong with any reading order of those.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a challenging but fun game, the last level took forever for me to figure out but I like that. I definitely recommend this game.
1582701709|5.0|I thought this book was excellent, lots of insight from lots of people who are in my opinion, new age thought, but  the secret has been around for ever, I met Rhonda Byrne, she truley is a beautiful person inside and out.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|At this point, I'm bribed by the game to rate it.  As the FAOD, it is the first of many to get me playing immediately.  That is partly due to the nostalgia, yet their art work pushed me to click open.  I'll try &amp; update my post as I learn more of the game.<br />At this point I'm in continuing play due to the Upgrade feature.  Those are needed to meet the more hectic attacks.<br />I place this game above normal but not sure it is perfect. Fans of the genre will enjoy revisiting, yet until I see my kids reaction, I rate it 3.25 and rising.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Adam Lanza is beyond genius. he has a unique way of making complex things understandable. he gives physics a new look
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Makes navigating my files on my android almost as easy as on my PC.  Essential for anyone wanting to do any real computing on their tablet.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Will definitely be purchasing more books by Liane Moriarty.  Enjoyed all the twists and turns this book took.  Read like a mystery and a love story.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|this is a pretty fun game but i have stopped playing the games that MAKE you connect to a social network to further your progress. so i deleted it off my kindle
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Playing this game was a lot like the old missile commander of old. Defending cities against alien attack was one of my favorite old school console games. I really enjoyed the upgradeable ammo and variety of targets. For now, it does seem a bit on the easy side, but that primarily goes from the touch screen interface. Being able to tap on specific points did feel to me a bit faster than guiding a cursor using a joystick, but I'm not going to complain. All in all, a solid,well executed game.
0761171703|5.0|Simply incredible, beautiful images! Bravo Jordan Matter! Looking forward to &#34;Athletes Among Us&#34; as well. Photography without manipulation at its finest!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|There are great new mechanics in this version of the game and it is definitely worth the $.99. Good value
1597801585|1.0|I love sci fi... So I ignored the negative reviews of this book as coming from those who don't... Oh my... This book was hard to get thru from the first sentence... Confusing.. Overrun with words of new invention without clear explanation/meaning maybe they were Thai or Chinese and I was supposed to know them... The &#34;groups&#34; were hard to figure out as well... What did they stand for?? What did they represent? And the Windup Girl?? Was she really the main point??  I think this is one to pass on... This book needs a lot of work.. Keep trying as I see imagination there.. Good luck on the next one or the revision of this one..
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|He's evolving, he's expanding his genre', blah, blah, blah.  For those of you that say if you like Born and Raised you'll love Paradise Valley, you're wrong.  I LOVED Born and Raised, thought it was one of his absolute best, this however is not, not even close.  It saddens me to say this about one of his albums but I just didn't get it.  It seemed, as one of the other reviewers put it, \\"rushed\\", sloppy and confusing.  I've only listened to it twice but I doubt it'll be much more than that, the first two times were difficult enough to get through.  That all being said, I will be waiting for the next compilation from John, hoping it's better than this one.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought this for daughters first phone and it has been great protection for it!  Case is smaller than other brands and colors are very cute!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The casual way the characters are presented in this book makes it so surprising once you realize how well you know them.  This is the best book i have read in a long time.  It is heartwrenchingly beautiful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive. Can't stop playing. So glad I downloaded this. Love all the different levels. Would highly recommended. Love that it is free also.
B000088SYA|5.0|This is the sounds of my teens.  I love it.  It takes me back to when I was young and it makes me happy.
0812982622|1.0|That this book won a Pulitzer makes me shudder for the state of letters.  North Koreans speaking Americanese while undergoing fantastic adventures seems a farce.  The graphic description of atrocity doesn't seem in keeping with the nonsense of the book.
055358202X|2.0|i couldn't believe how boring book 4 was. the best parts only happened the last 200 pages. i hear good things about the 5th. cant wait to read it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I wish the old Atari 2600 Missile Command was touch compatible, it would have been way more fun. The upgrades make it far more entertaining as well.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Harkens to the days of the Atari... if any of you reading this are old enough to remember what that is.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|First play has been fun. We'll see if ads start popping up, in which case I will be disappointed with amazon for making this an app of the day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am not a gamer, and I kinda suck at this game, but its fun, and it keeps me coming back.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved it, wonderful continuation to the first book.  I look forward to finishing the series.  Very, very engaging book.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Another awesome album by the greatest guys ever!!  They never disappoint their fans and soon everybody will give them the credit they deserve for their talent!
B005HSG3VK|3.0|The item was not quite what I was expected. Had Amazon half off voucher so the price was reasonable but not worth sending back. The case was very lightweight and the back doesn't keep the Kindle stand up well like the back groove is too narrow to support the Kindle. The color was pretty!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love the challenge of this game. My brain is a little slow, so I can work on making myself feel faster by playing this game. I really enjoy it :)
