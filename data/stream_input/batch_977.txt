B002L3RVCY|5.0|I never understood why, when I arrived at the theater to see the new Clone Wars film, the place was not packed with Star Wars fans. I loved the film. Just loved it. I thought it was incredibly well done. The action sequences were about the best I'd seen in animation. The story was good and I loved Ahsoka and her interactions with Anakin. Everyone looked a bit funny with the style used but that was alright. It's a cartoon after all. I didn't expect life-like images of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen.<br /><br />So of course, I had no problem sitting down with my son to watch the series either. And we have both enjoyed that immensely. The stories are always thoughtful and have the same mixture of humor and drama that characterized the original films. They are a bit episodic in nature but they have multi-part episodes and to a degree they all tie in, so it's not an endless series of planet-hopping to no purpose. You understand why the Jedi are there, what their goals are, and what the goals of the Separatists are. We get to see some of the Jedi we barely saw in the films, including Aayla Secura and Kit Fisto (even his padawan), and we see more of the Jedi Temple and its inner workings, including the crotchety old librarian who was so snippy with Obi Wan when he went there for help in finding Kamino.<br /><br />We also get to meet the clones, up close and personal. We get to see that despite being clones, they have different personalities. We get to see Commander Cody, the man who would eventually try to kill Obi Wan, and Captain Rex, and others. Knowing that these fellows will obey Order 66 and one day try to kill the Jedi they often times so clearly admire, is touching. If you've played Star Wars Battlefront II you've already experienced this to a degree from the eyes of the 501st - the boys Anakin took into the Jedi Temple to exterminate the Jedi in Episode III.<br /><br />Why would anyone turn down the opportunity to delve deeper into the Star Wars universe?<br /><br />Remember at the beginning of that episode how the crawl said \\"there were heroes on both sides\\"? Here you can meet some of those heroes. That line had always struck me and I'd always wished Lucas had been able to expand upon the idea. Now he can. Who were the people and the creatures who led the Separatist forces? If you want to find out, watch Clone Wars.<br /><br />If you're a Star Wars fan, give the show a chance if you haven't already. Just open your mind the way you did the first time you sat down to watch the first movie. I was skeptical that rainy day back in 1977 when I went to the theater to see Star Wars. We were bored and decided to take a chance. It was a life-changing moment, the most memorable film in history. While the cartoon may not compare visually (it's a cartoon after all) it further fills out the story you fell in love with on that day. Like George Lucas said, Star Wars is ultimately about Darth Vader and his redemption. If you want to get to know him better, watch Clone Wars. He's got a hard edge, and you an see the elements of his personality present that take him to the Dark Side later, in Episode III. And I think what takes place in this series makes that development a little easier to understand, since Lucas had to telescope the transformation to fit into the films. I doubt by the time we are done with the series that it will seem all that abrupt when we sit down to watch Episode III again.ing of that episode how the crawl said \\"there were heroes on both sides\\"?

B0034GK7DM|5.0|Prime Cuts: This Far From Memphis, Leaving a Lonely Town, Don't Ask Me About A Woman<br /><br />Behind a great record stands a great producer.  Just when country music has been hijacked by the derivative rock of the 70s and the drivel of adult contemporary shtick of the 90s, this record is the avatar that there's still hope for fans of the traditional persuasion.  This album's raison detre is to a large measure due to presence of producer Carson Chamberlain.  Being the man who wrote some of country music's cornerstone pieces such as George Strait's chart topper \\"The Best Day,\\" Alan Jackson's \\"Love's Got a Hold on You\\" and Tanya Tucker's classic tearjerker \\"(Without You) What Do I Do With Me,\\" Chamberlain has given this disc a traditional push that sets this release apart from the current radio fare with nary a cacophonous chorus of noise or screeching electric guitar riffs.  Rather, listening to this CD calls to mind an amalgam of the countrified sounds of George Strait, the mournful cries of Keith Whitley and the tropical escapism of Kenny Chesney.  Vocally, Easton Corbin does have a southern drawled tenor that calls to mind the aforementioned Chesney without sounding too distinctive.  Nevertheless, it's the songs that make this record a stand out.<br /><br />First and foremost, Easton Corbin is to be congratulated for his hard work in learning from the best country music in town.  You could almost hear Alan Jackson singing \\"Don't Ask Me About a Woman.\\" This is the type of record that made Alan Jackson such a superstar:  clever use of words over a humorous take on the gender divide all over an infectious melody.  And Easton Corbin is wizened to take this a signature hit to come and make it his very own.  The carefree \\"A Lot to Learn About Leavin'\\" calls to mind Kenny Chesney with its Cuban-island relaxing feel.  Tony Lane and Johnny Park's \\"Roll with It\\" has an uncanny resemblance to George Strait's mega hit \\"Run\\" except that it is set at a faster pace with pronounced fiddling.  The jaunty \\"The Way Love Looks\\" triumphs on its sunny disposition over some Diamond Rio-esque guitar and Corbin's Brad- Paisley type excitement.<br /><br />Despite Easton Corbin's tipping his hat to his sonic heroes, it doesn't mean he is bereft of his own signature authenticity.  The saccharine \\"Someday When I'm Old\\" has a bluesy feel that is riverting piece to listen to.  One of the best road songs this year has to be \\"This Far From Memphis,\\" which scores the record's best original line \\"Now I've run out of road/So I guess my only hope is to trade this truck for a boat.\\" If you want to hear Corbin bear out his soul, take a listen to the mournful \\"Leavin' a Lonely Town\\" and prepare for some tearful moments as Corbin bids his parents goodbye as he leaves home.  Lead single \\"A Little More Country Than That\\" may not chart new grounds with its picturesque reference about Corbin's own self identification with everything rural, but it has such a gorgeous melody that it stays etched into the memory for the long haul.<br /><br />For a debut record, Easton Corbin's self titled release is a winner.  It doesn't yield to the temptation to crossover to the pop market nor does it endeavour to be sound hip without regards to the album's depth.  Rather rifle with clever and catchy tunes over a backing which is afraid to let the steel guitar and fiddles take the lead, this is a bona fide country record.  And producer Carson Chamberlain is to be congratulated together with Corbin for a job well done.The jaunty \\"The Way Love Looks\\" triumphs on its sunny disposition over some Diamond Rio-esque guitar and Corbin's Brad- Paisley type excitement.

0307266303|5.0|Though I am not a runner, this was a interesting book.  It tells a story about this tribal of super-runners.  The tribe has the ability to run long distances better than the best athletes in the world.  The book weaves this story about this tribal with narrative on how to be a better runner.  The book begins by wondering why the author's foot hurt, and as he searches for this answer he discovers some interesting insights into the nature of running.  The book is a page turner as well as a great story.  If you are a runner, you will love this book, if you are into hiking, which I am, you will love this book, and if you never ran a day in your life, you will like this book.  The author even dealt with the 100 mile race in Leadville Colorado.  If you like adventure and sports literature, you will enjoy this book.
0553584537|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. FROM PAGE 1 I WAS HOOKED. I REALLY LIKED THE TWISTS, IT HELD MY INTEREST AND MADE ME THINK. NOT AS GOOD AS SAY GOODBYE BUT STILL A GREAT BOOK. I THINK SAY GOODBYE WAS HER BEST BY FAR.
B00333NCTM|5.0|What a character. What a life! I've never been a huge Black Sabbath fan (loved \\"Changes\\" and \\"Crazy Train\\" though), but became an Ozzy/Sharon fan when their MTV show was on. He was so sweet and loving to his family and for me, that was totally unexpected. How could you not love Ozzy Osbourne after seeing how he was with his family?<br /><br />This book tells us about his life growing up, when his career started, his stint in prison, when he got into drugs and alcohol, when and how he met Sharon and everything in-between. I cannot believe he's still living, but I am so happy he is. The man has a phenomenal sense of humor!<br /><br />He tells a story about chickens and their coop....OMG, it was just unbelievable. His adventure at the Alamo with  the dressing gown...holy cow...I laughed 'til I cried and I never, in a million years, would have thought I'd laugh about a Colonoscopy!  This book is HILARIOUS and sad at the same time because Ozzy is a VERY funny man, but very troubled emotionally and drugged himself to the extreme. Everything he did he did when he was high AND drunk.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading about people and bands I listened to back in the day. Ten Years After and ELO. Tommy Lee (HELLO! I think I know more about Tommy's body parts than I needed to know! LOL!) and so many more bands from the 70s that I use to listen to and love. That was fun to read. They were all so young and just starting their careers too. Fun stuff. It brought back some great memories.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book SOOOOO much and if you like Ozzy, you will love this book. I'm just flabbergasted he could remember enough to fill an entire book. ;) Read it. You'll enjoy it.
B002RI9UKE|5.0|I think this is a very positive and good feeling book. A must read for anyone looking for a real pick me up!
159562015X|3.0|There are 4 books in these strength based book series:    1. First Break All The Rules  2. Now Discover Your Strengths  3. Strengths Finder 2.0  4. Go Put Your Strengths To Work    All of Marcus Buckinghams books are incredible and will definitely help you in finding your strengths and are all worth buying.    However this is about Strengths Finder 2.0.    The only reason to purchase this book is to take the new strengths finder test and get a couple new things the first book didn't have.   In the back of each Strengths Finder 2.0 book there's a packet that contains a unique access code.     The first 30 pages are great content and you should read them but the whole rest of this book are details about each of the individual 34 themes.  This information is all contained in Now Discover Your Strengths also. The only difference is that the 2.0 book they give you 10 ideas for action and   3 ideas on working with others. Both helpful.    I bought both books. I initially took the Strengths Finder 2.0 Test and will take the Strengths Finder 1.0 later  (the first test in Now Discover Your Strengths)  to see how different it really is in a couple of months and see if I have any different themes compared to the first test.    If your not an entrepreneur or not in a management position you don't need to buy First Break All The Rules. Just stick with the 3 other strength books.
0375842209|3.0|This was a good good book. Its not the first book that comes to mind when I am recommending books to anyone. Overall, its a good book and you can't go wrong.
B000Y1H7VA|4.0|Zeitgeist isn't up the standards of their previous albums, but some moments of it are among the Smashing Pumpkins' best, songs like United States, Tarantula, Neverlost and 7 Shades Of Black. These are the songs where the booming guitar tones and synths come together really well. Other songs, That's The Way (My Love Is), Bleeding The Orchid and the last two tracks aren't so successful. Not bad songs, just not all that inspiring.  Anyway if you don't have Zeitgeist then I'd recommend this version, since two of the bonus tracks, Ma Belle and Death From Above, are well worth having, though Stellar is the worst track on the album. The dvd is two music videos and a 20 minute documentary, which is pretty interesting, though probably not worth it if you already have some other version of Zeitgeist. I only bought this version because I'd heard and liked Zeitgeist, but didn't own it.  The silver packaging is pretty cool, if that tempts you to buy this for some reason, though there's no booklet inside as there is for most CDs, guess the dvd makes up for that.  Don't expect Mellon Collie or Siamese Dream when you hear this, but something that sounds a bit different, though closest to Machina. Do expect to hear Jimmy's amazing drumming, though, especially on United States (and all 10 minutes of it was done in one take, according to the dvd).  Soooo in summary the dvd is ok, the bonus tracks are good, the album varies between genius and indifference and United States is incredible.

0743201140|5.0|First off, if your a manager you should probably read First Break All The Rules.    Any book written by Marcus Buckingham is well worth your time.    Now Discover Your Strengths seems like it applies more towards personal development rather   than managing people, which is why I bought it. However you can use the information to become a better manager.    Can't really say there is anything I didn't like about this book. It provides tons of insight into YOU and answers  almost every single question that pops into your head.    The only question I had that they didn't answer is this. After taking the Strengths Finder 2.0 Test you get back  your 5 main themes. My question is this. How close were your next 5 themes that didn't make it into your top 5...?    This is one of those books that after you read it your going to re-read it and constantly go back to it again and again.    I would recommend for Entrepreneurs and other people serious about finding out their strengths and weaknesses also  take the Kolbe A Index assessment. It will provide more insight in helping you identify your strengths and weaknesseses.    I took the Kolbe through Strategic Profits. Why..? After you take the Kolbe A Index your left with, so what do I do with this now.  Rich provides an hour video and 30 page ebook to help with this. Kolbe also has some great audios to listen to as well.
0143037757|5.0|This is a titanic telling of European history since WWII. It begins in the immediate aftermath of the war, and from there painstakingly details the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Europe up to the present day. This is a massive undertaking, and Judt makes a comprehensive job of it in a style that is consistently scholarly and fascinating. To the uninformed who want to learn more about this period in Europe this is a paramount resource; the book explains Europe's post-WWII reemergence, the strain between nations, the growing totalitarian influence of Communism, the loss and increase of power between states, the Cold War, crushing economic problems, the Balkan genocide, growing US resentment towards Iraq, and much more.    Judt is obviously a born historian, and there is hardly a detail here which is left out not delved into. But what Judt also excels at is detailing European's (especially central- and eastern-) altered sense of values and morality in the midst of a time in which societies were so compromised writ large. The great defining point of modern European history- the Holocaust- is ever-present in the background of Euro politics and has a subtle impact even in present-day European life. My main complaint, however, is that sometimes the book is just too much. It is massive in size, and its tone is oftentimes textbook dry. Complex economic policies are thrown at you to digest on your own, and sometimes Judt's hypotheses about the cause of major and minor conflicts sound more like intellectual braggadocio rather than regular, proletarian insight.     It is a book to take in small doses; read about an event and pause to consider its impact on its sister countries and in the continent as a whole. Europe is a big fighting family here, each member filled with its own rules and ambiguities but connected to each other through a shared, contentious history. This book sheds light on the history ad infinitum, and is highly recommended to anyone with the desire (andtime) to learn more about it.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The one star is for bootlegs, not for the genuine article, which rates a five in my book.  I've seen quite a few complaints about bootlegged copies in this thread, and thought I'd throw in my two cents on the subject.  People interested in buying this item need to know that Amazon and Ebay are awash in bootlegged copies of this and other popular DVD and CD audio titles.  It's very difficult, if not impossible, for huge online sellers like Amazon and Ebay to police such activities, so it's largely up to us fans to hold the sellers' feet to the fire.  Do not buy from ANY vendor who will not guarantee, in writing, that his or her product is a 100% authentic Disney media product.  There are undoubtedly some vendors who are so brazen that they will make this guarantee even though they know it's totally false.  I received a counterfeit copy of this DVD set from an Ebay vendor, and the people who sell this trash depend on their buyers not being able to tell the difference.  Some people don't care, but for those of you who do, look for the following:    The authentic US release of this particular DVD set came inside an immaculately printed cardboard sleeve.  I believe the DVD case inside the sleeve was then encased in shrink-wrap plastic, with Disney or Buena Vista security markings printed on the wrapper.  The DVD case inside the wrapping also had separate adhesive seals on it, that had to be broken/removed in order to open the case.    Look carefully at the printing on the outer case liner.  It should be sharp and clear, with no fuzzy edges or wavy type, especially around the proof of purchase and UPC code blocks on the reverse side.  If you see any such indications of second-generation printing, it's a counterfeit.    The original DVD set included several items of printed material, placed inside the case with the disks.  If your set doesn't include this material, it's a knockoff.  If the printing on the material has the same indicia of second-generation printing as thatseen on the outer case liner, it's a knockoff.    Look carefully at the disks themselves ... the printing on the face of the disks should also be immaculate.  The colors and lines where they intersect should be bright and distinct, not blotchy.  The copyright and trademark information printed around the outer edge of the disk should be fine, but very legible, and not bleeding into the underlying colors, with no misspellings or weird gaps in the type.    The playing surface of the disks should be glossy and spotless, with no nicks, marks or smudges of any kind.  If the title of the movie appears on the inner ring of the playing surface (e.g., \\"Beauty and the Beast, Disc 1\\"), it's a knockoff.  Disney never puts such verbal markings on its authentic discs ... only code numbers.  Disc titles are laser etched into knockoff discs so that the little scumbags who are assembling the counterfeit products by hand in China and Taiwan (or wherever the counterfeits are being mass-produced) can easily identify what disks they're putting into the package.    Hope this helps, and please ... don't knowingly support people who traffic in pirated copies of copyrighted materials.  Think of the millions and millions of dollars, and incalculable number of labor hours invested by the lawful owners of products like this.  Don't help someone deprive them of the financial rewards that are rightfully theirs for the massive risk they take in bringing brilliant creative work like this to the world.    In short, demand the authentic product, and then proudly ENJOY IT!
B002GJU54E|5.0|Loved the book! As with every Janet Evanovich book, it's well written and a very cute story.
0385737947|4.0|I met James Dashner at the Book Expo America in June of last year. He was there for the signing of one of his 13th Reality novels as well as the Advance reading copy of The Maze Runner. Needless to say that I got my hands on a signed and dedicated copy of both of those and was really excited to read both from what James had to say about of them. Unfortunately, life happens and other things took over and I haven't been able to read either one of those until now. They've been waiting patiently on my shelf, biding their time until their number is called and I give them some attention. Or so it was with The Maze Runner until a couple weeks ago and I am very sorry that I waited so long.<br /><br />First off, can I say that the feel of the book and of the characters reminds me quite a bit of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card? Am I allowed to do that? I know that Ender's Game is one of those staple stories in the world of speculative literature and that it's easy to come back to it when there is even the smallest of similarities, but in this case I want to use the comparison as a compliment to James Dashner with his novel.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is interesting and intriguing from the get-go because you are thrown into a world as the character, Thomas, enters it and...he has no memories. Which means that because he has no idea what is going on, well, neither do you. This is a great way to start off a story, of course, but it does quite a few other things that are quite advantageous for James and the reader. It allows James to answer questions as they come along into the story. No overwhelming the reader with backgrounds or explanations, etc...we want to know all those things, but then again so does the character. And that is the key to the second benefit, which is  that the reader has an opportunity to try and figure things out for himself.  It brings me back to the old days of `Make your own novel`! \\"You turned the corner and found that your path is blocked by a creature...you decide to fight your way through (turn to page 153)...or...you decide to turn around and find another path (return to page 98)...\\" Ah, good times - Do they even make those anymore?<br /><br />I loved the twist and turns that came along with all that was happening in the book. I had theories as to what was going on and how to solve the problems that were being faced, but I have to say that I was only right about very few of them. That's awesome...I love it when I can read something that is more cunning than what I anticipate, I would dare say that is the reason I keep reading books all the time. It's for those few stories that are actually capable of giving me something I haven't been thinking about. And James Dashner does this amazingly well.<br /><br />The language is simple - this is a teen read - but the characters are complex and lovable. You grow attached to the ones that matter and despise or feel sorry for the ones who make things more complicated. Though, I must admit that I wish for some of the characters to have played a bigger role, or to have been more emotionally involved to the direct storyline - but the end of the book compensates for it all.<br /><br />The beautiful thing I haven't mentioned yet is the way you get drown into the story by the way it is ended. This is huge! The Maze Runner is the first book of a new series, and I am now hooked on the idea of wanting to find out what is coming next. The epilogue pull's you into the entire story the way a prologue should...the maneuver is masterful and I can't say more without spoiling anything. All I can say is that if you start the book, you really have to get to the end, it's the greatest revelation in the entire novel.<br /><br />With The Maze Runner, James Dashner uses the complexities and deceptions of the maze itself as a way into the human soul. The puzzle is a doppelganger, an outward manifestation of the kind of things these characters need to work out in their own hearts and minds before they can escape the world that they live in. They are prisoners in a world that was created for them, but also prisoners in the world of their own mind and consciousness. They may believe that there is only one maze to solve, but in reality I would say that they cannot leave the one until they have overcome the challenges of both.<br /><br />A great read and a explosive ending, once again I can't help to think of Ender's Game.  I'm looking forward to more and believe that James will take us somewhere even more exciting in following volumes.<br /><br />For more reviews, see my website: [...]They are prisoners in a world that was created for them, but also prisoners in the world of their own mind and consciousness.

031606792X|5.0|I first read the twilight books in june last year and have loved them and i can read them over and over again.  I think Breaking dawn is by far the best one has lots going on and goes in to alot of detail which you can actually picture in your head.  My family and friends have read the books to and loved each of them.  i was pleased that bella ended up with edward but still had jacob in her life and was still able to see her dad, she got everything she could want. i think it was a prefect ending, i only hope that when the film comes out it will be as good as the book.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I have enjoyed Miyazaki's films for years, and in the past have watched them with my 5-year-old son, but he has never been overly into them or asked to watch them, it has always been a fight between my picks (Howl's Moving Castle, Nausicaa) and his (Cars, Toy Story). However, when I saw the reviews for Ponyo I hoped he might like it, so we watched it together today.    Wow! It is rare for him to be so completely enthralled by, and emotionally involved in, a movie. He enjoyed every little nuance of the movie to the fullest (giggling at every instance of 'HAM!'), and when Ponyo's father took her back to her home under the sea he was seriously NOT happy. When she busted out her little chicken arms and legs and ran back to her beloved Sosuke on the backs of her behemoth fish/sisters, he was almost giddy. I truly enjoyed the film and didn't want to look away at any point - the story was enjoyable in its simplicity and the artwork completely amazing - and I especially did not want to miss my son's reactions throughout. I would highly recommend this for any mom with younger children!    One final note - in the past I have been disappointed with the American voice acting in these movies ... the Japanese voice actors have always been so superior. However, this one was very well done - at no point was I irritated by the voices or words that were chosen.

1878424319|5.0|I originally gave this book three stars.  Possibly because it was small and written in simple language, the book snob in me did not find it worthy of 5 stars after my first reading.  However, I have changed my mind.  I was led to read a passage after a very disturbing dream.  THe passage helped me decipher the dream perfectly.  I have read the book again several times and now appreciate the deep wisdom it contains.  Its one of those special finds that just keeps getting better as you grow in your ability to understand.

I contacted the company and told them and they advised my to send it back and they would send my a regular DVD.  I explained that I did have an HD system but it must not have been formatted correctly.  I decided not to send it back because it would cost me over $5.00 in postage and I only paid $4.50 for the DVD.  I did not want to invest more than I paid for the DVD.  I purchased the DVD elsewhere.  I would not purchase from this vendor again!

Never intending this for anyone but for his own use, this is a true picture of how Michael worked with people in preparation for his concerts. Maintaining a loving and calm atmosphere for artists to work with him. Of course it is not a finished concert, we get to look behind the scenes. I was amazed at what he had planned for leaving the stage at the end of the concert.  Using new technology on a concert stage, incorporating 3D into the concert.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I was really happy to find this DVD on Amazon. I received it very quickly & the quality is perfect!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was both horrified and impressed!  I was horrified at all the \\"food politics,\\" and impressed that they could get so many people to talk about what's going on.  I learned a lot, and I felt this was an important enough issue to purchase the movie so that I could share it with others.  I particularly like the fact that they didn't alienate meat-eaters--the corruption carries over to corn, soy beans, you name it.  The basic message is this:  Know where your food comes from!  And I like the fact that, just when you are at the point of despair, at the end of the movie they give you suggestions about things you can do on the positive side!

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I can't get enough of Lady A and they just seem to get better and better. Every song is great and it covers all genre's of country music...love songs, rock songs and tons of just plain talent. You will want to learn the words and sing along...especially to the title song! If you have ever been in love you want this CD!
B000002MIY|3.0|After the wonders of The Nightfly, I rushed out to buy Kamakiriad (on cassette) as soon as it was released, and instantly fell for three of the tracks: Trans-Island Highway, Florida Room, and Teahouse on the Tracks.  Having just re-purchased it on CD, I personally think that Kamakiriad has the some of the strongest songs Donald Fagan has ever written, across all his hugely impressive solo/Steely Dan output.  And to fans like me, this means some of the finest \\"pop/rock\\" songs ever written.  On top of this, his singing is perhaps the best he's ever done.  \\"On the dunes\\", in particular, tests his vocal skills and range to destruction, but it is a very engaging and endearing performance.     These are 5 star compositions, so why the 3 star rating?        The problem I have is that some of the musical arrangements have never sounded right.  With Donald Fagan you know that he'll include complex chord/key changes and angular arrangements.  (It's fascinating to see him on film demonstrating how his compositions evolve).   At first I thought \\"give it time, I'll grow to like the arrangements\\".  Unfortunately, many years later I still think some of the arrangements are wrong, for two main reasons.     First of all, the producer, Steely Dan's Walter Becker, and/or Don himself should have ditched a lot of the brass/horn work.   A signature feature of many Steely Dan tracks, on Kamakiriad the brass/horn sections (not the solos) are totally over-done.  They don't add much, and become irritating.   The one that REALLY bugs me is on Snowbound.   The arrangements cut across the song's natural rhythm and ambient mood.  Deliberate or not, played on real brass/horns or on keyboards, they don't work.  They should have been binned.  After this track, you might hope that's the end of the brass/horn stuff, but it keeps appearing on other tracks.   If I was the producer I'd say: cut, cut, cut!    I was so glad to hear much less of the stuff on Morph the Cat.     The second issue I have withthis record involves the guitar playing.  With Steely Dan and Don's other solo work, you get great session musicians playing great guitar lines and solos.  Guitar lines that drive the music on in an up-beat way; always impressive, sometimes stunning.  On Kamakiriad, some of the guitar parts seem poorly thought through - with a lack of strong ideas and direction.  If you listen to the CD in detail on headphones, it can sound particularly lame - rambling guitar lines, going nowhere. In keeping with the story??  No.  Just not very inspiring.  (Maybe that's why so many of the tracks have been beefed up with brass/horn sections?)        Despite this, I still strongly recommend you buy this CD.  Enjoy the tunes for what they are and have fun with the story and lyrics.  But also imagine you are a producer/guitar genius, and work out how you would make it better!
B000V86OKG|4.0|I thought it slowed down a little from the first season, but it was still good.  I never stopped watching a half episode or a whole episode each night.    What is up with morons giving it one star because they did not receive their product or the dvd they got from their supplier was in poor condition.  That has nothing to do with how good the series is.  Seriously, that is an huge display of lack of intelligence to rate something poorly on a review like this because you received it late.  What does that have to do with Dexter the series?  Go leave bad feedback regarding the seller, not rate a good series poorly.  I wonder sometimes.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This is the best sci fi I've seen in a long time.  While I watch 200 or so films a year, I don't post comments on line.  Trust me on this one, watch it then decide.      I wish I could wax as eloquently as others.  Perhaps the brevity will persuade.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am not into series and will not buy series, but I bought this one.  The only other series I have ever boughten is Band of Brothers and that was really a mini-series.    This is good stuff.  It is intelligent, sarcastic, sexy, vulnerable, justifiable and you laugh at the narrative and some of the dry humor that goes on.  There are very contrasting characters set up.  A good guy serial killer series basically in a nutshell.    I watched the second series too and enjoyed that enough to buy the 3rd season.    For me, I rent other movies on the weekend and when I was watching the 2nd season, I would not take the time to watch my rented movies because I wanted to watch Dexter instead.  It will suck when I run out of episodes to watch.    Highly recommended.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|As one reviewer says below this is not 24 bit audio. It's PCM 16 bit 5.1. However, I find that it is one of the best discs I have in my collection for audio quality. I have over 200 SACD's and around the same number of DVD-Audio discs. I have been playing these 2 formats since their inception. This Bach Blu-Ray stands out as one of the best amongst the discs in my collection. Oh, and I also have around 100 Blu-Ray concerts, most of them in DTS MA 5.1 and this Bach disc in PCM still stands out from most of them due to the care taken. The video is acceptable. There are many concert BD's that I have that have better video. The audio is what stands out on this one for me.
B00000295A|4.0|To me this album was good.  It feels mild and progressive with some nice jazziness to it.  These are not speed freakish songs like some of their albums later on.  I think it is good and very different from the modern albums.  However, I like the early and later albums.  I came along to hear of them when Travelling Without Moving cd came out, so I was lucky to be in the middle of their transition, so I can appreciate the earlier, jazzy relaxing music and the more frantic, impulsive music they sometimes make now.    I do find it funny how the early people are disgusted by the newer stuff.  I think the true hardcore beginner fans sound like protesting hippies and they got mad when Club 54 came around and took the hippies and turned them into disco tripping freaks.  I do understand why people without an appreciation for a broad range of music don't like the later stuff, but I enjoy all sorts of music and Jamiroquai is one of the few bands out there in my opinion, along with (Incubus) that can put out cd after cd of quality music.  Some cds are better than others, but none of the cds is garbage.  Even all great bands get flaked out or crappy or sell out after a while like (Limp Bizkit, Bush, Pearl Jam among basically every other band out there in the world), however I like and appreciate basically every Jamiroquai cd.  Different enough to keep it interesting and close enough to not say what the heck kind of transition is that.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|we got three icp cds from this vender and they were all in excellent shape
B000W9MMPU|1.0|The movies are great! I ordered them so I could watch them on my laptop while I'm recovering from back surgery. Not knowing I got HD DVD's that do not play on my laptop, X-box or any DVD player. I contacted the seller via e-mail, and got no response. Now I'm stuck with these great movies I can't watch.
1400052173|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read.  It brings to light the question of how much a person owns of their own body and how lighly that ownership can mean to the scientific community.<br /><br />If you have ever been in a hospital, you have to wonder what all has been done with your genetic materials while you were there; what reports were generated, and who received those reports.
B000003BEV|3.0|Transaction was great. No problems whatsoever. This is not one of the Stones stronger albums but I lacked it in my collection.
630460291X|4.0|We have viewed the movie and it is fine was only dissapointed by no Title cover otherwise everything is great. Speedy delivery as well.
B0010X745K|1.0|Good acting, good effects.  All spoiled (for me at least) by the most infuriatingly unsatisfying ending I've ever seen.  I want to hurt someone over this.  If your time has no value whatsoever, I *still* recommend you do something else for 2+ hours.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|I love him. I have loved almost everything he's put out. He writes incredible songs and the music is almost always perfect. Up was worth the wait but is this? An album every 10 years and this is what we get? Big Blue Ball was a little cold and the Wall-E song was very good but....I know he's out saving the world and creating new music technology but I want to hear his music and I'm not sure why it takes this long. I realize he's a perfectionist and tweaking is fine but as a fan I just want to hear more. You can judge the songs for yourself because the album is good but it's not enough for me. I'll get back to you in 2020 with my next review.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|What can I say about Michael Buble - he has the most mesmerizing voice of any male singer alive today. Elvis would be the only one to top him. This is becoming my favorite CD. AT THIS MOMENT is an old song - but I much prefer his rendition to the original. The emotion in his voice on these songs touch your heart - you can feel the pain and sincerity. I bought it on amazon and saved almost $12 over the stores and got it the next day.
0756405890|4.0|I've spent time, thinking and thinking about why I liked this book.  It's not that so much happens, because it doesn't.  If the book has duel plots in which the main character is both detailing his life story as well as conducting his \\"quest\\" (if that's the right term) to understand the largely hidden, antagonistic Chandrian, then it seems safe to say that there's moderate progression of the former and minimal progression of the latter.  As a reader of Jordan and Martin, I have developed a modicum of literary patience, but even those two, notorious for their ever slowing plots, saw greater progression of major events in their first works than we see here.<br /><br />And, yet, I'm very satisfied with what I've just read.  Rothfuss writes subtly about this world he has created.  The people, places, customs, history, flora and fauna, and all other elements of the world aren't detailed in such a fashion that we might say worldbuilding is a major task of this novel.  The world is rich, but we come to know it not through the author's descriptions, but through Kvothe and how he and these various elements interact.  In some ways, this makes for a more difficult read.  Each new detail is a puzzle to be considered (by Kvothe and by the reader) and, often, less than completely understood.  We know these things exist, but it's unclear how they all fit together.<br /><br />In addition, the main character Kvothe is well balanced by his rival, Ambrose, and heart's desire, Denna.  They help to develop the main character and, at the most basic level, I know that Rothfuss has written something well when I have my own visceral reaction to it, much as I have when Kvothe is dealing with these two characters.  Anger, frustration, a sense of injustice...these boil forth in the often brief interactions Kvothe has with such characters, as I often found myself thinking \\"surely this time he'll...\\"<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining read that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more (which should be upcoming).).
B0032KNA4I|4.0|One of the major problems with movies these days is hype. We become inundated with glimpses of movies coming out, bombarded with clips and sneak peeks, witness to countless interviews with stars and eventually we feel as if we know the entire movie coming out weeks before it hits the screen. Hype. It can make a small movie desirable or it can make a blockbuster fail. And sometimes, as in the case of 2012, it can do both.<br /><br />2012 sets itself up using the notion many conspiracy types have that the Mayan calendar calls for the end of the world in that year. So the film makers took that idea and ran with it, giving us a glimpse at the possible destruction of the planet. Director Roland Emmerich is notorious for full blown special effects movies that deliver the goods and he does so once again with this film.<br /><br />Of course a story needs a central figure to base the tale around and here we have John Cusak as Jackson Curtis, a science fiction novelist whose book did well at first only to see sales drop and no follow up behind it. This explains his current position as a limo driver. Divorced with an ex who has remarried, it's his weekend with the kids and off camping they go.<br /><br />Earlier, scientists were noting a change in the earth's crust. Radiation from outer space was altering the make up of the Earth with dire consequences on the way. Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) had seen the data and informed the President who put him in charge of the entire situation. His team set out to find a plan to deal with the situation or at best, to see to it that the human race at least survived.<br /><br />When Cusak and the kids are in a park camping, he comes across a seeming nut job played by Woody Harrelson who is broadcasting warnings about the end of the world from his Winnebago. He shows a map to Cusak who more or less writes him off, but with a nagging feeling he could be right.<br /><br />Push comes to shove, at least with the surface of the Earth and quakes begin on a low level. But knowing what it coming, Cusak calls his wife and tells her to gather the kids and get ready to move because the big one is coming. She argues and of course all hell breaks loose before she can hang up the phone.<br /><br />The first major special effect sequence begins as Cusak grabs his family, including his wife's new hubby, and they head for the airport. Good thing they took him along because he is studying for his pilot's license. As the street collapsed beneath the back wheels of the limo, they barely make it to the airport and take off as the ground opens beneath them, swallowing portions of the city while the rest slides off into the ocean.<br /><br />With no where in California to go, they head east and for Las Vegas where they hope to at least find fuel if nothing else. At this airport, Cusak runs into his ex-employer, a Russian businessman who was told of the impending quakes and who has paid to be in a location where humanity will be saved. Not because he offers anything worthwhile, but because he can afford it.<br /><br />Again with the last minute takes off and an attempt to find the secret location, even though the poles of the Earth have now rotated out of skew and a compass isn't worth diddly. Get the picture? Last minute saves and super tremendous coincidences that are at times so far fetched as to stretch the limits of \\"sustained disbelief\\", the idea that this is only a movie and things could happen this way in a film. And those I've mentioned are the most believable ones!<br /><br />But folks don't watch movies like this with the hopes and dreams of learning how to survive the worst. No, they go to it for escape, to watch heroes come through and (hopefully) bad guys pay the price. And more than anything with a film of this sort, they go to watch amazing special effects. On that count at least, this film delivers like no one can believe. A small screen may not press it in your face as much as the big theater could, but it is still effective.<br /><br />Along the way there are other side stories and actors involved, but the main focus revolves around this core group. Each actor does a good job of playing a convincing role, be it stunned disbelief at what is going on around them or doing what it takes to make sure that your family stays together and survives catastrophe.<br /><br />For a movie this big, face it, you're getting a condensed cliff notes version of what it's all about. But then to give you every detail of the film would deprive you of enjoying it. Is it that good? Well no, it isn't, but it is entertaining. Face it, more than anything you're going to enjoy the special effects and that was what drew most people in to see this movie. They are amazing.<br /><br />This won't be a movie that will go down in the annals of film as one of the best, but as I said it is entertaining. And more than anything it makes you wonder what you would do in this given situation. Hopefully that will be to make sure you treat others as if this was your last day on Earth as opposed to building an earthquake shelter. In any event, if you're looking for a bit of entertainment, this film gives you what you're looking for.es and actors involved, but the main focus revolves around this core group.

0307269981|3.0|This second of Stieg's trilogy is a good story.  Entertaining.  It was, in the end, compelling.  But it took some time to get there.  The final third of the book was especially suspenseful, or at least I thought so.  But the first third of the book was hit and miss.  It seemed the storyline didn't find it's direction immediately coming out of the previous book.  There were some tangents to the story line that I thought would be later tied back into the plot, but ultimately seemed to just add to the number of pages in the book (specifically, I'm thinking of some of Salander's exploits and adventures in the Caribbean early in the story).<br /><br />Salander's character was, I think, transformed a little too much from the likable, brainy but socially inept genius hacker who was able to gain the reader's sympathy in the first book to a slightly oversexed bisexual, violent prone, all-man-hating superhero vigilante freakish chick that ultimately lost some of the reader's sympathy (or at least this reader's sympathy).  I think Larsson would have been better off to keep building on her intellectual capabilities rather than revert to the image of a slightly-built lady that packs a nasty punch.<br /><br />Finally, the end of this one is a mixed issue.  Larsson did build good suspense in the finality of the story.  He did leave the reader hanging with what I perceive as an ending that is entirely unfinished.  However, if the author's objective was to build the suspense then leave the reader hanging in order to compel the reader to purchase the third book so as to ultimately find out what happens to Salander and Blomkvist, then he succeeded.  But as a reader who likes some answers to the twists that were presented along the way, I was sorely disappointed and the book failed to deliver.<br /><br />But I do need to know what's going to happen.  I will await the U.S. release of the final book and I will definitely read it.
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|Listening to my favourite jazz station on the way to work one morning, I was instantly drawn to the voice and style of the singer on the track that was playing. I made a mental note to Google the Melody Gardot when I got to work. I bought the available 2 cds right away and have been listening to them ever since. Soothing and refreshing presentation that calms the spirit. Whilst some of her lyrics are of subjects that are somewhat of a darker shade, the method of delivery somehow overrides the heaviness and delivers a constant injection of beautiful melodies and absolutely astounding backing. I am enthralled by both her cds and cannot wait for her next effort. Pity there are no Toronto dates on her concert tour.    Thank you Melody!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|When John Lennon proclaimed, 'Back to Mono' on the LP 'Sometime in New York City', it wasn't some kind of Luddite expression. Only listening to the Beatles albums as they were originally meant to be heard, do you gain any true comprehension of the genius in music arrangement both the Beatles and George Martin possessed. 'Genius' is not a word I use lightly. The instruments come to the fore the way they were intended and each spoke a particular line. It is more reminiscent of a well written and structured theatre performance. In stereo, all of this is lost and becomes a rabble of noise. You take your pick of just who you are meant to be listening to. Technology and special effects are no substitute for craftsmanship. It is akin to the travesty of motion picture colourisation. It wasn't meant to be that way and only reduces it to caricature.  This is probably the best thing that has happened to Beatles music since they stopped recording. I can only imagine having them actually play in my living room to be better than this. George Harrison once said something like, 'I don't believe it to be real music unless I can hear the scratches on the record'. This mono box set has all the warmth but without the scratches.
B0030BYWKU|4.0|Where to start off. Well, I just wanna say, Jason Derulo has been one of my favorited artist since I first heard of him back in 2007!! It's kinda funny, b/c I already knew all the words to \\"Ridin Solo\\" for like almost a year now and that song use to have a different beat. The beat, use to be \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\". I'm assuming, he took the beat out b/c the label didn't have the rights to use it but I could be wrong. What everyone needs to understand about Jason Derulo and every new artist, is they don't call the shots. You can't judge Jason Derulo, based off of this album. If you had, any clue on how much say a new artist has on there debut album u would think before u leave comments criticizing Jason Derulo. Since the last 2 years, I have about 30+ songs from Jason Derulo and if you heard this songs u would know what he is capable of!! He has a song called, \\"Electrifine\\" and it is actually one of my favorite songs of all time and if u knew what my other favorite songs were than u would know that this song has to be good to be on that list!! I knew, when I first heard him that he was goin places. Everytime I would talk to one of my friends, I would tell them about Jason Deruo and they would be like \\"who the hell is that\\" lol!? What people need to understand is, ur lucky to even get signed by a major record label which thousands of artist try to do and fail :(  Once your signed, doesn't mean ur down easy street now. Your lucky if u even get an album release, b/c if the record company feels like they can't promote u and ur not pickin up enough fans for them to fund your projected they'll drop u. Soo, believe me when I say this. This album, Jason Derulo is just a simple of whats to come and understand that he did not have 100% say on this album, soo before u judge put all that into consideration!! I use to be a manager, at f.y.e. and I remember when I became a fan of Robin Thicke and nobody really ever heard of him. It was almost 1 1/2 before he released he's album, \\"The Evolution of Robin Thicke\\".  I tried, hyping people up for a year straight while I waited patiently for that album to come out and there were points when I really thought that his album was never gonna be released. Now look how big he is, he had an album that he released back in 2003 called \\"A Beautiful World\\" which not many people know about and if they did they didn't know about until they become fans of his after he's second album was released!!  Soo, before u judge a new artist think about how much say they have on there first album. Think about the material they would like to put on the album, but can't b/c the record company has pretty much full control over what's going on the album. Soo. for future reference.

0143036742|3.0|Despite the title, there's much more to this novel than tractors.  It's really more of a fable about a family coming to a realization that the past, namely their history as immigrants from the Ukraine, never really goes away.  It begins with the death of the mother, a thrifty and conscientious woman with two bickering daughters.  Their previously eccentric father, an inventor of sorts, becomes increasingly unbalanced and ends up marrying a blonde bombshell from Ukraine, fifty years his junior.      The storyline goes as you would expect it, and there are no real surprises.  The underlying theme of identity is emphasized with tragic and comic stories from their childhood.  At points it becomes a slapstick comedy of the strangest proportions with the lovesick old man and his embarrassed daughters.  Things seem to resolve a little easier than would be predicted, but with a fable they usually do.    This is a fast paced and witty read.  I didn't find myself particularly drawn to any of the characters, and much was left simmering at the surface without real depth.  To really enjoy this, I'd suggest having a map of Europe at hand, because much is made of locations and journeys.
B0035V35P8|5.0|I GREW UP WATCHING MOVIES LIKE NINJA 3 THE DOMINATION AND REVENGE OF THE NINJA...THIS BRINGS BACK THAT NINJA TRADITION...THIS DEFINATELY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE STILL GREAT POTENTIAL IN MOVIE MAKING, YES THERE IS GORE BUT IN A GREAT WAY AND NOT IN A CGI OVERLOAD WAY, IT STILL LOOKS LIKE REAL BLOOD....THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY HAS GREAT ACTORS PLAYING GREAT PARTS AND ITS NOT JUST ANOTHER WHOLESALE MOVIE THATS TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK BY SKIPPING QUALITY...ANOTHER WORDS....THIS MOVIE IS WORTH YOUR TIME.
1400052173|1.0|I don't know why this book has such great reviews.  I found it tedious and could barely finish it at the end.  The cell history and research was interesting but not compelling.  The characters were interesting but again, not compelling.    I don't understand the great reviews on this book, not my cup of tea.
0802130208|1.0|I like comedic books, dark comedies, and the like. I picked this book up because it was referred to with one of my top 5 books: [[ASIN:0385521731 A Fraction of the Whole]]. I found nothing funny in A Confederacy of Dunces, no relevance to Fraction of the Whole, and  when I read the part where the moron is masturbating I threw it across the room. This is not even dark humor, it's disgusting, the characters were utterly pathetic creatures, wastes of space and a despicable example of the human condition.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|This movie was ok. The visual special effects were incredible. The story so so. You knew what was goingto happen before it did. Woody once again was the best character in the movie.
1934356476|5.0|I have a BS and MS in Computer Science, and worked with Ruby professionally for two years. I've read every major Ruby book on the market. This book brought me to the next level. If you dig Ruby or Rails and are a programmer looking for the next step, this is it.
0823015033|4.0|This is an amazing book. Katherine Dewey did a great job writing an all-inclusive, clear, detailed, informative book about sculpting polymer clay - which is very difficult to do. She goes to great lengths to demonstrate the necessary tools - and more than that, she shows (in detail) how to make those tools. What a reference book!<br /><br />The only thing that disappoints me about this book? By reading it, I will not be as talented as Katherine is. I've clayed for years - and I cannot create anything remotely as fantastic as this author does. She makes it look so easy - but don't be fooled. Katherine Dewey is clearly an exceptionally talented clay artist. Although she does her best to share her techniques and tools with the audience, simply buying this book will not make you better with clay. Sorry. I was somewhat deluded by that, I think. I purchased this book thinking I could some how absorb some of the talent and raw skill of Ms Dewey - don't make that mistake. There are definitely many things to learn in this book - and they are laid out in a patient, concise method. However, if you have no skill or talent to begin with, buying this book isn't going to help you. I have practiced several of the techniques laid out in the book - and I'm still just as crummy at clay as I was before. This is not the author's fault - but it's daunting.<br /><br />As far as claying books go, this is one of the best I have. It covers a vast amount of knowledge and contains technique explanations like crazy. I suppose what keeps me from giving this book \\"5 stars\\" is my own disillusionment. Katherine Dewey's skill is a little intimidating - and it is frustrating to follow her direction and not have your piece resemble her final product. If buying a wonderful book like this doesn't help, I should probably give up on clay...but I can't. I love it too much.<br /><br />Bottom line: you will learn many techniques in this book, from the necessary tools (and how to construct them) to sculpting methods, to finishing to how different brands of clay behave. Reviewer Katherine Canuel made a great point - the amount of information contained in this book is similar to what you would find in a college textbook - it's that good.

0307387178|4.0|A very good book that shed light on an incident of which I had only heard rumor and hearsay. Krakauer did an outstanding job researching and retracing McCandless' odyssey, through his tragic demise. Krakauer also keeps the book from devolving into a documentary by trying to dig into McCandless's mind and extrapolate what his thoughts might have been. The author is able to do this so well because he readily admits he strongly relates to the main character. Like many men who have survived their 20's, I was able to relate to McCandless as well- the determination, the recklessness, the need to forge one's own path, all sadly coupled with a lack of wisdom. Had McCandless not made those seemingly small but crucial mistakes at the end, he would have succeeded by relying on that same youthful grit and determination (& stubbornness) that served him so well for two years, but which ultimately led to his downfall. Then perhaps he could have written his own memoir about a man who had the courage to live life the way he chose & took the road less traveled...
B000YIGNKE|4.0|This a very nice adaptation and Sally Hawkins is masterful as always. I think the only problem was that it was only given 90 minutes, so a lot of plot and some character development needed to be trimmed. To have Anne racing around Bath looking for Wentworth wasn't really true to the story but it was beautifully done. This script really pushes Anne's heartbreak to the forefront but that's appropriate and really what makes the story so relevant. Anne's fear of being alone -- especially surrounded by a dreary family -- is what so many young people experience at some point in their lives.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|What I would give to sing like the incredible kd lang. I remember seeing her perform on the Canadian Juno awards many years ago- in a wedding dress with cowboy boots. She owned the stage and was mesmerizing. One can't help but close their eyes and just let her smooth, mournful voice wash over you. A beautiful collection.
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|hi.  i love this box set.       my only problem:  when i got it, however, the little paper with the digital copy code was missing.  i ended up clicking the help option on the dvd menu & sending an email to the company that way.  in a few days they emailed the digital code to me.      http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Digital-Copy-Activation-code/forum/Fx3MCS5YCIG3J4L/Tx21R1L4VBFFVBQ/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B00188M5UG

0240810554|5.0|From the outset, this book is not for faint-hearted digital camera users amongst us. It is a book crammed full of easy-to-follow & understand recipes and tips for REAL photography, but beware, you may actually want to get your hands dirty if you read it! Ah the smell of the darkroom, no photoshop here, thank you!    I bought the \\"cookbook\\" because I feel that old-fashioned photo art is quickly vanishing , good riddance I hear you say? Well, You don't know what you are missing until is is no longer here.     Very well written, in a well organised conversational style that truely makes you believe that the author is chatting to you personally, one on one. I'd like to add more, but I want to return to the book, so ...........
B0030BOCEG|5.0|I disagree with the reviews that say this is a new sound - I say this is the old sound we loved about his first three classic releases.  I debated whether to get this cd because of the dissapointment of his   last two outings - Dark Light has some classic tracks on it but as a whole cd was just not quite up to the high standard of the previous ones.Venus Doom left me with the feeling he was just trying for a sound that well.. wasn't HIM - I was just left with the feeling they were trying for a harder metal sound and it didn't work for me and took them away from the sound they do best especially Ville's voice, Gone was alot of the deep tones replaced with a strained sound - And a screamer he aint(or shouldn't be).  ANYWAY -I love every track on this cd and have regained my faith in HIM.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Ok, my controller was purchased brand new. After 5 months, the R2 stuck. Guess what, Sony asks me to pay for the shipping to their service center. Rationale behind it? It is not the whole system, so Sony would not be responsible for the shipping. If you are considering buying a Sony controller, bear in mind that the quality may not be as good as you expect and you are paying for the shipping.
0226264211|5.0|I bought this book because I understood that Milton Friedman was a leader in (classical) liberal (meaning libertarian) economic thinking.  Now I see why.  Pure genius.  This book appears to be written to the general public, although I must say that if are a complete stranger to economics certain parts of this book may confound you.  I am a beginning student of economics, and only 2 paragraphs were out of my grasp.  It's true, some of this book was a little dry, but those sections were short.  The scope of the book is surprisingly wide for it's size (202 pages in this edition)-yet it's level of detail is satisfying.      Friedman's arguments were compelling and well constructed.      If you are a progressive, (modern) liberal, socialist, statist, marxist (or whatever else) and want to know what free-trade libertarians believe-this is to book for you.      If you are an economic conservative or a libertarian (as I am) and you want to read a great book that will make you smile-this is the book for you.      Overall a fantastic book.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My grandchildren and I not only enjoyed this movie in the theater house but also in the living room.  Enjoyed, enjoyed, enjoyed
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie gives a comprehensive understanding of the BIG AGRI BUSINESS machine and how it ruins our human qualities and the sacredness of life. Food, health, honesty, animals and people manipulated for the sake of money. It is cruelty to animals and ultimately cruelty to humanity. Hope is there though in the farmers and people who refuse to operate under this AGRI DICTATORSHIP. You must see this and share it with everyone. LB, Richmond Hill, ON
B0015DYIH2|5.0|this was an outstanding story. ive nevr read a trilogy before, especially one that everyone was so crazy about. i thought for sure this was going to boring or predictable. none of the above happen.   I really admire Mrs.Meyer for her greatest acomplishment yet.  Bella and Edward deserved all the happiness they got. Especially Jacob- it dosen't matter where it comes from. But that was a good twist.  Belive me ive read alot of books in my 30yrs, and that was damn good.  As for the rest unbelievable good!!  Hopefully Mrs. Meyer's creates another adventure with the Cullen family and its newest member too.
B001F12J0C|4.0|We enjoy all of the Bourne movies.  The Trilogy was very enjoyable and this box set was a good value.
0393324818|4.0|The book is an easy and very interesting read. Michael Lewis is a great writer. Although he is writing about a topic I have little interest in (baseball) I was still drawn into the characters of the story and the business lessons the story offered.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. A great deal can be expressed with spare orchestration and one of the best voices in progressive rock. Despite the fact that every song is a cover, Mr. Gabriel makes each one his own. I compare this with many of the better segments of Roger Waters' \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" and \\"Amused to Death.\\"
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|Bought this movie to watch on Christmas night. My son is 4 and he loved it. I can't wait for next Christmas when my daughter can get to watch it with the family (she's will be 2) provided she can keep her attention throughout the movie (which I doubt). It will be a nice Christmas tradition to start for our young family.
1405054255|5.0|Great story and keeps my son's attention throughout.  Very adorable book about the adventures of a snail and a whale.
B001AQT11M|5.0|Bought this movie to add to our Disney DVD collection. I was about 7 y/o the last time I watched it (I think). It brings back good old memories of a happy childhood. And I would like to do the same for my children.
B000AYELVA|5.0|The movie is in great conditon. It had no scratches or anything like that. It came quickly in the mail the only problem with it is that the box was slightly damaged but the seller told me that it was damaged before I bought it, and I'm glad that the seller informed of it. It didn't make me hesitate at because it's just a box and not the actual movie that is damaged.
0375703764|1.0|All young writers should have good editors.  The book is, like most first novels, fresh and interesting, but ultimately self-indulgent; replete with author intrusion, self-congratulatory cleverness, and a whole lotta time wasting.  Character development is virtually nonexistent and the plot doesn't so much advance as trail off into some unexplored corner of the house of title fame.<br /><br />People posting reviews who compare this book to Nabokov or Borges really should go back and re-read some actual Nabokov or Borges, either of whom can say more in a page than this writer can say in a hundred.<br /><br />It's a nice try. It has some decent ideas.  Postmodernists will probably like it, 'cause it's all so avant garde doncha know.  But it really isn't a novel so much as somebody's writing journal accepted for publication.  Read _Pale Fire_ or one of JL's parables, and save yourself a week.
B001HN697M|5.0|The DVD is in great condition. There are no scratches on it at all. I got it fairly quickly in the mail. Also the box didn't have any damage it on it as well. The movie was good. All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|Original Review (4 star review): When I was considering whether to buy this album or not, I went through reading various articles discussing the release and I was generally expecting to be unimpressed and, as much as I hate to say it because I've found many if not all of Peter Gabriel's albums to be brilliant in their own way, disappointed...long story short, ok shorter, I ended up buying the album and having only given it a single listen, I find it to be much more interesting and engaging than I'd expected.  I would not give the album 5 stars and in no way is it the best work (though we must remember that the album consists of reinterpretations as compared to original scores) ever put forth, but I'm not unhappy that I made the purchase.    Updated Review (5 star review): Now that I've had time to listen to this album many times and in two different formats (cd and vinyl), I can honestly say that this is one of the most brilliant albums I've heard recently.  At this point, I find myself unable to stop listening after setting up a single track, it really draws you in (if you are focused on listening, of course).  The sound quality of this album is absolutely astounding :)  Great work by Mr. Gabriel and his team on this one and I'm really looking forward to the next release!!!
B0000026WD|5.0|The CD is in amazing condition. There are no scratches on it and the CD plays perfectly fine. The case was in great condition as well. Also the booklet that comes with a CD was there and in pristine condition as well. It also came quickly in the mail and everything from this seller exceeded my expectations.
0553284347|5.0|There is a lot of eye-opening information in this book, and would be helpful for those who have had or even think you have had dysfunctional relationships with family, friends, co-workers, etc. I think it would be helpful as you read to jot ideas in a notebook to take to a therapist. I do not think it is a good idea to act on any ideas that may have occurred to a reader during or after reading this book without talking to a licensed therapist.
0061537969|5.0|Well written and heartwarming story.  There is a tenderness in this book that opens the heart to the joys of dog companionship.  Not too gushy. Appealing for both male and female readers.
031606792X|5.0|Although this book is in many ways quite different from the first three, it's still a satisfying read for Twilight Saga fans.  However, you'll probably be sad when you finish it since it's the last book (just like I was).
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an excellent movie especially since it is based on a true story. I do hope Sandra wins an academy award. They should have a special award for Meryl Streep because she always wins...This time Sandra who has been around a long time and who has never won best actress...deserves to win! Certainly not a fantasy like Avatar......
0375842209|5.0|This book is amazing!  I read a lot, but have never come across a book quite like The Book Thief.  And it definitely is not just for teens.  I enjoyed it immensely as an adult.  I discovered this book because I stumbled across a Be a Book Thief website [...] and read about this group of people that love the book so much that they are making an effort to get it out to the world.  They'll even get a copy to you if you need, which is cool.  So I decided I needed to see what the hype was about.  Well now I get it!  This is a story that I can confidently say I will never forget and it has definitely changed me to have experienced this book.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Markus Zusak is an incredible author.  After finishing The Book Thief I read I Am the Messenger.  Fun book!  It's different than The Book Thief (which I personally prefer) but a great book with an important message.  I seriously can't rave about this book enough!  Read it now - you're missing out! :)
B001W79MB8|5.0|I can't speak for the special features, since I haven't checked them out just yet.<br /><br />PLOT (no spoilers):<br />Pretty standard fare.  A nameless swordsman must protect an innocent boy against the hostile battlefield of two warring factions.  The main antagonist group consists of an elite bunch of highly-skilled Chinese warriors who feel no pain, at the head of which is a mysterious blonde swordsman ailing at his inability to find a worthy adversary.  Lacking somewhat in the originality department, the story nonetheless draws you in by the sheer charisma of its characters.  The characters themselves convey their archetypes well, without being overly obvious.  The cliche factor is evident, but luckily it doesn't detract from your enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />ANIMATION:<br />Though at times inconsistent (read: some of the battle clips appear noticably choppy, while others are smooth as silk), this feature is still head and shoulders over many of its contemporary counterparts.  The characters' movements are believably natural, and their facial subtext succeeds in making you actually care about what they're thinking.  At times, CGI is used for set pieces and background work, but it's so well-integrated that it complements without distracting, and is often unnoticable.  Most memorable of all is the climactic battle between the swordsmen No-Name and Luo Lang: this is far and away the single most visually arresting swordfight I have ever seen in an animated feature.  Ever.  It invokes a tangible feeling of suspense and wonder, the choreography is brilliant, the scope is incredible, the pacing is thrilling, and their movements are positively GORGEOUS.  It'll make the hairs on your neck stand up, mark my words.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />I usually prefer subtitled anime over dubbed, as English voice-overs can be spotty, and often omit certain important nuances.  However, Sword of the Stranger's English voice actors are all very talented, and they mesh perfectly with the setting and their respective characters.  The sound effects are particularly well-done; at the moment when No-Name strikes the killing blow against his first Chinese opponent, the explosive crack of wood beams shattering and the brutal gnashing of bone pound straight through to your core.  It gives every action scene a very visceral and immersive feel.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Sword of the Stranger simply must not be missed.  It's certainly not the most original thing out there, but its tried-and-true story formula can be appreciated by most anyone, and the action is definitely top-tier material.  This isn't a film you can watch only once.racters.

0375836675|5.0|I love this book!  I wholeheartedly recommend anything by Markus Zusak, as he has to be one of the best authors of our time.  I Am the Messenger is a fun book with an important message.  It's a great book for teens, and I enjoyed it as an adult.  You must check out The Book Thief by Markus Zusak as well.  Truly a masterpiece.  I believe it's a modern day classic - I imagine our grandkids will still be reading it.  I heard about it on a Be a Book Thief website I stumbled across ([...]) and I had read about how these people love it so much that they are doing whatever they can to get copies out to people.  I had to know what the fuss was about.  Well, once you read anything by Markus Zusak, you'll get what the fuss is about and you'll want to join in!  I recommend his books to people all the time and I can't even begin to express how much I believe everyone should read them.  Personally I would start with The Book Thief (especially if you are an adult, as I believe it's better for us grown-ups :)) but you can't go wrong with any of his stuff!  Please, Markus, get us a new Zusak novel to read!!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|A must see for everyone in america. The following week after watching this we went to our local organic grocery and will continue to shop there from now on. Cost wise it was not much more than our local food-like edible substance store either.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|Just one question, why on the Blu-Ray version  cover do they have names wrong under     Alan Rickman and Tim Allen. They should be reversed.
0316044938|5.0|This was a fantastic read! I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I bought the book. (Although, of course, the book goes into a lot more detail and is somewhat different than the movie in certain aspects.) The movie had such wonderful special effects that really bring the book to life. The book really makes you wonder about what happens when we cross over and are caught in the \\"in-between\\". Once you start reading this book, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Fantastic!
B00284BMBM|5.0|Chris Daughtry has come so far since coming in 4th place in American Idol just a few short years ago.  This is the band's 2nd CD and it raises the bar even further than the 1st.  I have heard this over an over in my car and there doesn't seem to be any chance that I will get sick of it anytime soon.  They are very talented and have an infectious sound that carries flawlessly from one track to another.  There are no bad tracks on this one.  Every one is a winner!  I highly recommend this CD.
B000003GBN|3.0|I was eager to hear this record, given its prominence, but it was a bit of a let down.  Certianly, nobody can touch Reiner's ferocious attack, bombastic yet exact. But in both the 5th and the Corolian here, his tempi are just too fast. They fall forward, and the players do too! The strings can't keep up! Just not enough fast-twitch fibers to execute these tempi well. Reiner's 1955 recording of the 3rd wows me, but these don't.
0060763280|4.0|Great book!  This book really brings to light some of the constant truths behind wealth building - why some can and why others can't. I consider it to be a \\"MUST READ\\" if you want to achieve financial freedom or build wealth.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 only because it frequently refers to a seminar that would be of great value - sadly I recently moved to Asia and the seminar is nowhere near here. I realize that a seminar is of great value, but... I bought the book. JUST GET IT. It's outstanding.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD has changed the way our household views our food and what we eat. We have the right to know what's in our food and how it's produced. We've become blinded by abundance, not caring so much how the chicken got there, as long as it's on sale for .89 a pound. I am appalled at what I and my loved ones have been eating for most of our lives, and we are changing our lifestyle gradually to support ethical organic farming and food production. After seeing this documentary, it's hard to understand how we've allowed ourselves to be blind for so long.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT HELD MY INTEREST THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  WILL PROBABLY WATCH AGAIN.

B001C4CI8U|3.0|So much for the new \\"X Files\\"...  I would think they have learnt their lesson :  Too \\"serious\\" for my own taste!  One of the only \\"new thing\\" seems to be the names of the places written all over the screen   (like \\"Panic Room\\" (2002): not so new...)  I just hope it will get better with time !

B0000542D2|5.0|ORDER IT. IF YOU REMEMBER THE '60S THIS WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO \\"THE GOOD OLD DAYS\\". IF YOU'RE TO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE '60S GET IT ANYWAY YOU WILL L-O-V-E IT!
B001TH16BK|5.0|I am a 60's freak and look for anything that has an original tracks.  This CD has items from the 60's by original artists, some longer than the original track but just as good as it was recorded so many years ago.  It is definitely worth purchasing if you are into that era.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I've watched this documentary twice and have learned so much. I want to hand this DVD to everyone I know to create the awareness of what's happening in our food industry. It's made me a more concious consumer and I am definitely following some of the suggestions at the end of the movie.  I think that everyone should see this.
B00001OH1S|5.0|Fun!
0688163173|4.0|I've always enjoyed Lehane's novels, and I enjoyed this one as well, but it was a far easier read than his usual style. This was a pretty straightforward story, without a lot of character development or local color which was prevalent in Mystic River. It was largely a 'visual' novel, with only the occassional insight into whats going on in the main characters head. In short, it read like it was written to be turned into a screenplay. I say a good story is a good story, regardless, but I did miss the old Lehane style of really putting you into the characters heads.
B001AX60KU|5.0|i recieved my elvis presley 68 comback special boxed set roughly a little over a week after i ordered it it was worth the wait for my second time ordering something from here it worked out pretty good thanks again!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This was a very cute movie. I liked and my little cousins and nephew loved it. Good voice acting as usual for disney. All around good story with a cute ending. Really worth watching.
B002UD56I6|5.0|it was great, very good footage of the future concert that would have been. It shows how good and patient he was with everyone and a perfectionet performorer
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It took the product so long in getting to me. I am very unhappy about it. the service was very slow. Somehow I feel this is not news to you people. Joyce  The service is the problem not the product.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This movie sucked in new ways we haven't even seen before. I only spent 99 cents on a rental and I still feel that I was cheated.<br />My 16 year old son and I (51) sat down hoping to hear some good music and see interesting images. It was so bad we kept fast forwarding through it. I wanted to poke my eyes out.....STOOOOOPID. How could anyone(like me)who actually remembers the Beatles and the 60's and 70's like anything about this atrocity.
055380684X|5.0|Eye opening new science. Written in a digestible entertaining form. Learn how to understand your own brain better. If you want to be excellent at something, if you have a child and want to help her find her calling or if you are intrigued by the mysterious workings of the brain, this is a MUST READ.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|So many people were so sure that Michael was in no condition to perform. The last laugh is on them. What I saw was Michael Jackson singing and dancing like He did years ago. Interesting too, that he looked so good despite being addicted to ALL those pills - yet the drugs in system were the ones that Dr. Loser killed him with. The film is awesome. He's not putting on a show - remember this was intended for his peronal library.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It really gets you thinking and motivated.  I bought several and sent them to friends I was so inspired! Money well spent!
B0035J6TAI|4.0|Who really expects Peter Gabriel records to be fun?  Even upbeat tunes have always been dark humor at best - Shock the Monkey, Big Time, Sledgehammer, etc.  I'm not familiar with any of these songs save Boy in the Bubble and I Think It's Going To Rain Today, so maybe that makes me less critical than others.  To me this is a beautifully orchestrated disk with Gabriel doing great job of expressing lyrics. Perfect for late night/rainy day listening.  Relax and dig.
B000UG78NG|5.0|Let me start by saying two things. I love fantasy, and I am an incredibly picky reader.    I found this book after spending literally hours browsing through the Kindle store searching for a new book to read. Initially the cover art caught my eye (not judging a book this way has never really held for me one way or the other) and I looked into it. After reading one of the reviews which gave a basic outline of the story I decided to take a chance.    The beginning of the book was interesting enough that I idly flipped through thinking that it wasn't a bad gamble. Once I got to the part where the main character started telling his story though, I found myself having a hard time putting it down long enough to do other things. Not only does the author do a great job of describing the settings while still moving the story along at a good pace, but he makes you feel the story. Not just the emotions of the characters but he gives you the sense of being in the story as an interested observer. It's quite easy to get lost in and empathise with and I think that's what makes it so good.     A story isn't a good story without being able to see part of yourself in it, and while I do agree with a previous review saying that it's a little much that the main character is a master of all trades, I think that this goes a long way to making the story more accessible to everyone to see themselves in it.    I very much am looking forward to when the rest of this trilogy will be available as I for one will get it right away
B00275EGWY|1.0|I was excited to see this movie, because I had heard good things about it. What a disappointment and waste of time. I found this movie to be DULL...not exciting, or tension filled at all, (as many have claimed).    The movie is predictable. As soon as I saw Guy Pierce, I knew he was going to die, how else to get \\"our hero\\" onto the team.   When the psychiatrist said he was going out with the team, I knew he was going to die. As soon as I saw the scene with him and that family with the donkey, I knew he was going to be blown up.  As for the scene with \\"our hero\\" trying to defuse the car bomb, of course he was going to save the day, the movie wasn't over yet. I was hoping one of the men watching him would detonate the thing. Then the movie would be over, or at the least, have one, non predictable moment. No I don't condone violence, but it is suppose to be a war movie, and things blow up.   I digress.  I knew when \\"our hero\\" was back home he would soon be back into combat, because it is \\"easier to deal with war and bombs than the everyday hum-drum of raising and taking care of your family\\".     This movie is also erratic. What the heck was up with the scene with Ralph Finnes? What was the point? How come Ralph was so easily picked off by the sniper, while \\"our hero\\" was moving around like he had ants in his pants and whining about a juice box? Then the random part where the other team member picked off that bad guy trying to come up behind them? The scene seemed unfinished. There was no explanation why Ralph and Co were even out there, or why \\"our\\" team was out there. No explanation or follow up as to how they all got out of there, other than the still living bad guys just gave up and left. (Which is what I should have done.)    I am not military, but it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to know you don't leave your base in Iraq, in your HOODY, to cruise around Bagdad. Come on. Really?    I did learn one thing that was very disturbing. The brave men and women serving overthere have to deal with the gruesome reality of \\"body bombs\\".  God Bless and Godspeed to all that serve.    Sorry this is so long, but this review has been festering since I saw this, pardon the pun, bomb.  I probably couldn't write a better script, but I'm sure I couldn't write a worse one. Unless of course I took all the war cliches in this one and add the two or three they left out.    If this is the best Oscar has, then we are in a complete dearth of good film making. Just my humble opinion.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have ordered a few of these over the past year or so from Amazon and I've found them to be of great quality and performance even against my original cords which were the high-end Monster cables.  I would highly recommend these for anyone looking to replace or add additional HDMI-capable components to their systems and these are a great alternative to those cables sold by the \\"big box\\" chains.<br /><br />The only thing I would point out is that this product, as with most featured as \\"frustration-free,\\" is a tad more expensive that it's counterpart in original packaging.  While the frustration free packaging is awesome and makes everything simpler, for some items it may not be worth paying the extra money to purchase it this way.  I guess it's a matter of personal preference.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|The price is entirely fair and pretty decent when considering this is the complete series minus The Plan; the package is a little bulky and unwieldy and the separate season boxes aren't made terribly well, but keep in mind that it is all worth it because it IS the entire series of what I think is the best TV show ever made.  I was delightfully surprised to find that there is also a figurine of a war-worn Cylon that comes with the entire deal, another enjoyable plus.  If your a diehard BSG fan then get the bloody thing and stop complaining about the slight issues of somewhat poor packaging.
0811868419|2.0|I first saw Rob Ryan's works on ppaper, a taiwan magazine.They looks amazing. But this book destroys Ryan's amazing work...terrible paper choice, terrible print color and terrible design. How could they publish his works like this!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this dvd. You can feel it working on your entire body, I also have her no more trouble zones so I have been switching back and forth.  Usually I get very bored with these types of things and I still love it!! Jillian does a great job!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I am a really big fan of The Sword of Truth series. I purchased The legend of the seeker with much anticipation, excited to see my favourite characters and the story come to life. I had watched nearlly the whole series before I got over the fact that half off the episodes weren't in the book and really began to enjoy the story unfolding on the screen. I found it really annoying that the writers of the show changed a few important key facts to the story but for someone watching who hadn't read the book you wouldn't even know. I felt the portayal of the characters was a bit bland and didn't do justice to the originals and the story seemed to flit about the place alot. As a fan of the Sword of truth I felt a bit disapointed at first as the series was not what I was expecting, but once you get past that the show is truely entertaining and left me waiting eagerly for the next series. On a final note the show is worth watching just to see the main character Richard get his shirt off, I really hope they find more excuses for him to take it off next season!
0807014273|5.0|I love this book.  The writer really gives you something to think about in your own life.  This book touches you mind, heart, and soul.  If you every though about a meaning about/for life, please read this book.  It would give you more insight then you can imagine!!!!!!!!

B0035J6TAI|5.0|PG once again sets new standards for others to try and follow.  This album is focused on the lyrics and vocals and atmosphere.  This album is outstanding and worth the purchase.  These songs are now PG songs - he makes them his own.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|When I read the official Amazon review first offered (and without an opportunity to say it was helpful or not), I really wondered if that reviewer had even seen the movie.   For example he described Pandora as a \\"planet\\" which it is not -- it is a moon, not a planet.       He was also obviously not into the movie -- at three hours, he probably spent most of his time out of his seat taking care of his \\"business\\" after drinking too much sugar soda and eating too much popcorn -- surely he was not moved by the story if he saw it at all.       But all three of the non-official reviews were wonderful, written by people who obviously did see it start to finish, and who understood all the implications.   For example the third and last of the non-official reviews understood how it paralleled our own European White invaders of the American continents, and their cruelty to the original inhabitants.   Even Columbus himself indulged in it, on the basis that as \\"pagans\\" they didn't have a soul, so it was all right to kill them, or work them to death building forts as in Puerto Rico, to where the last live native american local died once the last stone had been laid in their fort.   The Spanish did it first, but were matched by their late coming Englih invaders who were no better.   And Pocahontas (correctly named Mataoka) could have been the role model for a similar princess among the na'vi.    I saw it first with my daughter in an ordinay theater (in 3D of course), and then took my wife to see it in an iMax theater (aso in 3D -- don't think it comes in 2D in iMax versions).   I saw so much more that I now remember the 2nd time around, that I'm anxious to see it a 3rd time, and will find friends who haven't seen it to make that happen.   My wife loved it, but couldn't understand that it was \\"art\\" and not just photography, but she did understand that sad to say it was fiction.   I also bought the book of the same name from Amazon which told me so much more about details, that I think a 3rd viewing will be rememberable even more now that I know details I didn't know before.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This film is based on the life of John Nash, the brilliant, Nobel winning mathematician and his extraordinary relationship with his wife, Alicia. I use the words `based on' deliberately as the film significantly strays from actual events and brings the spirit of Nash's life to the screen rather than being a true-to-life biopic. For those who want to learn more, I suggest Sylvia Nasar's book `The Beautiful Mind', which was also the source for the film. I do not want to say too much about the plot as if you have not yet seen the film, it will spoil the effect. The film attempts to put you inside Nash's head and experience events just as he did. For me, it worked extremely well. Try not to find out too much beforehand if you want to savour the full effect. Rest assured, however, that the film is very much about the human story of Nash and his devoted wife. The math, whilst integrated into the film in a variety of innovative and entertaining ways - the explanation of game theory has never been more interesting - remains in the background. The acting is superb: Russell Crow is revelatory in the role and how he missed out on an Oscar is hard to fathom. Jennifer Connelly did win an Oscar for her performance as Nash's wife, and the film also took best picture, best screenplay, and best director awards. They were well deserved. For a thoughtful, deeply moving, and incredibly inspiring film: this is it. If you manage to watch it without knowing too much about the contents beforehand, it can also be disorientating as well - just as Nash experienced his life.

0670021652|5.0|I didn't want to start this review talking about EPL, but it's unavoidable. I read EPL while I was traveling through Italy at the start of this winter, and appreciated the story for it's rawness, and humor, but mostly because I identified with the reflective nature of Gilbert.     When I read others reviews of Committed, I got the impression that it would not be personal, humorous, or even interesting unless I lived to read mundane facts about things like marriage and various processes of immigration. I am glad that I took those reviews with a grain of salt, because Committed turned out to be a wonderful follow up to EPL! I will say that there were a few pages I skimmed because I am horribly impatient and wanted to know what happened next, but I'll catch them the next time around.    I think in the same way that we would expect a musician's next release to show growth in range, skill, and maturity, Committed shows us how Gilbert grew as a person because of what we know she experienced in life leading up to her finding Felipe. Essentially being forced to marry him, the underlying question of hers that I got from reading this book is, \\" How does being a married woman affect who I am as an individual?\\"    In Committed, Gilbert addresses many aspects of marriage including (most memorable to me)the role of marriage in history and culture, ideals versus actuality, and partner and quality of life expectations within a marriage. What makes this book personal is that she defines what these things mean to herself with the same funny, raw, descriptiveness that we love her for.    Committed is not the fairy tale of EPL. You have to put on your thinking cap, as Gilbert (with her unique style) guides you away from the attitude of  \\"Just do it\\" by questioning, researching, and personally defining (to the last detail) something as big as the institution of marriage!     The adventures of travel are in here. The humor is here, and the romance is here too, it's just not front and center stage. Committed gives you a fun story to follow, but whats more  - it offers provocation, and I suggest any woman who has been, is, or is thinking about marriage take it up on it's offer!
B0035J6TAI|1.0|Peter Gabriel is a top 50 musician of all time and extremely talented and prolific. This album is not what I would call enjoyable listening entertainment. Most if not all of the songs are not 'fun' and are what you would call, non-uplifting. Guess we'll have to wait another 6 years for a new material release. This album belongs in the cut out bin.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|I will admit, this film was entertaining, but not for all of the right reasons.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson was funny for the few minutes he was on film.<br /><br />It was very \\"Disney\\" in the sense that of course the most terrible days before the end of the world are here, yet this small broken family is able to overcome all odds... This includes making and landing impossible street jumps while driving a LIMO... plus the fact that the earth seems to crumble DIRECTLY behind them at all steps along the way for the entire film... without giving too much away in case you actually are interested in seeing the film... The family is always able to escape *just* ahead of any disaster at hand, none of which are very believable situations.<br /><br />The special effects were great, I believe a lot could have actually been done to make this movie a fantastic one. I think I would stick to discovery channel quality just to get a more realistic storyline.<br /><br />I realize, I say \\"Disney\\" to give an idea of the overall feel of the film... however, as action films go \\"National Treasure\\" both 1&2 made MUCH better action films and were practically documentaries in comparison.

0061703257|3.0|Overall Shutter Island is a good, tight read. It's not a surprise that the book was optioned for the movie right away -- the plot and description lend itself to a film very well. My only criticism is that the plot is a little transparent and at some points it felt like I was reading an adult version of \\"I Am The Cheese\\" meets \\"Fight Club\\".
B002DKGWSE|2.0|There is not much to say about this film others haven't.  It's a remake of Wes Cravens \\"Last House On The Left,\\" which is still one of the most shocking films ever created.  With a higher budget, the acting level definitely rises.   But the running time, at 1 hour and 50 minutes, gets very boring.  And what ruins the whole movie is a terrible, way too long rape scene that was inserted apparently to only piss off everyone. And I am never bothered by rape scenes; this one was way too much.  Then the revenge parts are very underwhelming. In the original movie, the parents went to very different lengths to put down the villians. Instead, this time they basically become the villians and/or slasher killers. While you don't feel that they did anything wrong, it didn't work as a whole.  This whole thing was much better when it had the 70's look and usually cut away before anything overly gross happened. This one spares you never, and manages to turn what should've been great into a movie that sucked horribly. Just buy the original; you won't regret it.

0321525655|5.0|If you dread death by Powerpoint this book is for you! Garr opened my eyes to the way we should tell stories via presentation media rather than the way we've all been taught by templates and predecessors. I recommend a copy in each office, if not on the bookshelf of every professional who has cause to stand up in front of an audience for five minutes or more with an LCD projector and a lap top.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|The music and lyrics are wonderful. The group is spirited and full of joy that becomes contagious.
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|This film is a quality family film with the usual Miyazaki combo of cute characters, morally-ambiguous \\"villains\\" and an eco-infused adventure along the way. Since \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" Miyazaki hasn't made a film quite as accessible to children as \\"Ponyo.\\" (It also logs in at about 15-20 minutes shorter than most Miyazaki films.)    One of charms that has drawn me to Miyazaki's work is the exquisitely hand-drawn feel of the pencil line art that have always been painted in a graphically rich two-shade process. The backgrounds are often enchanting pieces of watercolor-style art that could stand as lovely art even apart from the bonus you get with charming and mysterious animated characters. Fortunately, as the age of computers has sped up the production process and reduced the costs of 2D animation, even the previous digitally painted Miyazaki/Ghibli film \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" still preserved a tremendous level of the artistic quality that the earlier hand-drawn, hand-cel-painted films had.     \\"Ponyo\\" on DVD is a stunning transfer compared to previous Miyazaki DVD releases. There is hardly any artifacting on the DVD transfer. The only bad detail is the hiccup where the film transfers out to play English intro/credits or Japanese intro/credits depending on what language has been chosen. Blu-ray is even more pristine a picture.     Unfortunately, this more pristine quality shows off that Studio Ghibli compromised too greatly on the digital conversion of the hand-drawn art. Line art looks overly black, rigid and sterile at times, like it was auto-traced with vector-art animation software. The softer nuances of the pencil art upon which it is based are lost most of the time. The digital painted \\"cels\\" are clean, but overly flat and without grain, and frequently missing the elegance of the two-color shading style that has been used consistently in previous Miyazaki films. Backgrounds at times look like cheaper digitally airbrushed backgrounds, which really stand out as horrid compared to some of the nice \\"Ponyo\\" backgrounds. \\"Ponyo\\" is very bright and colorful, yes, but below the art standard of previous Miyazaki films. Some scenes are so bad, and some characters so consistently poorly rendered (like the \\"bad guy\\" father Fujimoto) that \\"Ponyo\\" art comes off more as a glorified Saturday Morning Cartoon, and not as a lilting, nuanced, subtly elegant masterwork like has come before.    \\"Ponyo\\" is a charming and worthwhile film to see, for sure, especially if young children are in tow. But of all the Ghibli films to get Hi-Def treatment no film has come up so short in showcasing the Studio Ghibli masterful, artistic 2D animation heritage as \\"Ponyo\\". I wish \\"Totoro\\" or \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" or \\"Castle in the Sky\\" had been released on Blu-ray instead.

Also watch KING CORN
B001TD1XWG|2.0|One of the worst Wayne albums I have heard in a long time. I have been a fan of Wayne since The hot boys and his albums have always been on point. This album just didn't work for me this time around. His voice doesn't mix well with the sound of rock. The only good songs were On Fire and Drop The World feat Eminem. The rest of the songs were garbage. If you want to buy a good weezy album you should buy the young money Cd. That cd knocks and every artist is on point. If you are a person who is into rock than you should purchase this album. The fans of Wayne who liked the Carter series and his mixtapes I highly doubt will enjoy this Cd. Word of advise, just wait for Carter IV to drop next year. I already heard some snippets of it and that album is gonna be bananas.

Thank you, Jonathan Larson.     C. Mauricio.  Rio de Janeiro, 2010.
0670021652|3.0|I guess I should have read these reviews! My Mom gave me Eat, Pray, Love as a Christmas gift in 2008, and I loved it! I went through a divorce from 2005 - 2008 (it seemed it would never end), and EPL just spoke to my soul and my experiences. I was anxiously awaiting Committed based on how much I loved EPL. I was expecting Committed to be, well, an EPL 2. As I said, I should have read these reviews.<br /><br />For others who are expecting a sequel similar to EPL, this is not it. Committed does have some personal stories intertwined, but it is really more of a study of marriage. Gilbert talks about the history of marriage and marriage-like unions and even dispels some myths. She discusses the impact of marriage on women. All very interesting, but I found myself wondering when the personal antecdotes would come back and, simply, just when will this turn into EPL 2?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. It was a fast, interesting read and I learned a lot. However, if all you really want is a sequel to Eat, Pray, Love this might not be the book for you.
B001EYU1VO|3.0|As a joystick, it's pretty ok.  It looks nifty and has tons of adjustability.  I had problems getting the drivers installed in Windows 7 64-bit, it wouldn't work.  I was about to contact Saitek support when I did a search and found mention in a FAQ on their website that this is a known issue and gave you some steps on how to fix it.  I was able to get the drivers installed OK eventually.  But if this is a known issue, I hope they're adding a note in newer boxes or that they should make this info more noticeable on their site.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|The Lovely Bones was an alluring novel about a loving father trying to keep his family together after the murder of his older daughter Susie, a self-absorbed mother who abandons her family, an independent sister who finds true love despite tragedy, a witty grandmother, and an angry brother who can't seem to forgive or to forget.<br /><br />When I began reading this book, I was already on page 100 before I stopped reading for the night. The book just flowed so well; I had no idea how much time had passed.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|If I had a theme music playing in the background, this would be it.  The tone is of eccentricity, the fun hectic world with a bit of pursuing and being pursued.  I find myself with the snippets from the songs running around my head.      I saw the movie on Christmas Day and when I left I found myself humming and a lilt to my step from the music in the movie.  It's been a long time since a soundtrack left that much of an impression upon me (like Star Wars in 1979 from John Williams).    I read that Hans Zimmer commented that he composed the music with the thought that \\"Real life happens in a pub\\".  Intellectual pursuit from the pub is how this soundtrack makes me feel.     In re-reading through Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings of Sherlock Holmes, I often times have this CD on in the background.  It makes for excellent intellectual reading and thinking background music. I find that it adds a lot to the driving experience when playing in the car.    I rotate this CD with other music styles but I keep coming back to it because it has the breadth in the symphony and styles of the classics that keep my mind engaged.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is AWESOME!!! I've seen a lot of reviews here that mention this workout destroyed their knees or having already had bad knees, it made them worse. Listen people!!! I bought this fully aware that I *DO* have knee problems. I've had 2 knee surgeries already. But seriously, DON'T BE STUPID! Jillian has a girl on the video doing the low impact version of these exercises. WATCH HER! Don't push yourself further than your body can go. If you feel pain or feel that inner voice telling you, \\"hmm...you're a wimp, don't do this,\\" listen to it!<br /><br />I've done this workout every day for 2 weeks now, using all the low impact versions of the exercises and it's been KILLING me. I love it! It gets my heart rate up and I am very sore the next day. I'm a moderate size with a good 15-20 pounds to lose so I'm very pleased to already have lost 5, plus I see a huge difference in my muscle strength.<br /><br />I must mention, for those with knee problems, she does not have modifiers for jumping jacks (though sometimes if I'm feeling achy there I will just step rather than jump). So if your knees are bad enough that you can't do a *little* bit of jumping, you might not want this video. Just walk or swim. When she does the deep knee lunges, I modify it DEFINITELY.<br /><br />But otherwise, this workout is fabulous! I really feel a huge difference in my arm muscles, back, abs and even legs. It is truly a FULL BODY workout!!! FIVE STARS!!!

0743455967|5.0|I originally bought this book as an audiobook on Audible. It was really enjoyable and inspiring, so I had to have the physical version of the book as well. As a photographer, I am always looking for inspiration in different places, and one very good source was this book. Both when it comes to how to work with ideas, and how to stand by your dream when you have one. It was really great to hear Stephen King describe his own breakthrough as a struggling writer trying to feed his wife and kids with a meager teachers income.

B0038P80CO|4.0|**Spoiler alert** I watched this movie 3 times in one day. Not because I liked it so much but because I kept missing things.<br /><br />The first time that I watched it I was reading a book and I looked up and there was a deformed space-alien-type creature on the screen attacking the protagonist (Ben Foster). I thought, hey, I didn't know there were aliens in this. Cool.<br /><br />So after it ended I watched it again and fell asleep but not before I learned that what I thought were aliens weren't really aliens. I didn't fall alseep because it was boring but because I was tired, that time I woke up in time to catch the ending and the protagonist on the ships bridge opened the hull covering the windows and realized there were no stars.<br /><br />So, the third and final time that I watched the movie I paid attention to it all the way through and found it to be quite an enjoyable, genuinely creepy horror/hard SF. OK, I'm stretching the HARD SF part. It's not written by Arthur C. Clarke or anything but the scientific set pieces are really clever and the design is cool.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is effective however the young version of him is a \\"turrible\\" actor. Just really pleasant to look at and has nice muscles and a lovely face but the boy cannot act his way out of a paper sack. That being said, I think that Dennis Quaid is admirable for not rolling his eyes every time the young scamp delivered a line with a greasy ham fist. Ham fisted line delivery is not my cup of tea unless it's a satire and it wasn't. I just wanted to say ham fist again.<br /><br />Ben Foster, from the intense and tiny man school of acting, the one that Willem Dafoe and Paul Giammatti graduated from, is as always competent. He's not my favorite but he's a good actor. He could have been cuter but if they wanted cute and not actory they probably would have had the young Dennis Quaid guy play the part and then my review wouldn't be as positive. So, yeah, he was a good choice for the lead of the movie and carried it well.<br /><br />The other characters in the film were pretty much stock and could have been swapped for other actors with different faces, voices, and generic Euro-trash accents. The Asian guy was good but he probably only stood out to me because he's Asian.<br /><br />The cannibalism was a nice and creepy touch but I think after 9 centuries people would get protein poisoning, even with their nifty genetic alterations allowing them to adapt to long term spaceship living. No veggies and all protein equals scurvy doesn't it?<br /><br />So, overall, I liked it. I rented it and I'm thinking about purchasing the blu-ray disk. I'd recommend it. Don't blast me for spoilers, I did put a spoiler warning at the beginning of my review and if my random ramblings spoil the movie for you because you neglected to take heed of my spoiler alert then oh wellsy.characters in the film were pretty much stock and could have been swapped for other actors with different faces, voices, and generic Euro-trash accents.

No veggies and all protein equals scurvy doesn't it?    So, overall, I liked it. I rented it and I'm thinking about purchasing the blu-ray disk. I'd recommend it. Don't blast me for spoilers, I did put a spoiler warning at the beginning of my review and if my random ramblings spoil the movie for you because you neglected to take heed of my spoiler alert then oh wellsy.
B003102JDM|2.0|Isaac Bashevis Singer once said that a writer's job is simply to tell a story.  By that he meant that writers should avoid the pitfalls of \\"making a point.\\" In keeping with the Singeresque opening of A Serious Man, the Coen brothers should have followed the advice given by a man who really knew his dybbuks.<br /><br />A Serious Man lost its way almost immediately after that all-too-short Yiddish folk tale opening. (If they had only stayed in Poland, what a film it would have been!) As soon as the action moved into the 20th century the Coens' contract with the viewers was broken. Not only did they fail to tell a story, they failed to develop characters, or to provide a basis for caring about what happened to them. In fact, by the end of the film, I was longing for them all to die.<br /><br />As in all Coen brothers' films, the photography was atmospheric, crisp, innovative. There was an occasional good scene (the ancient rabbi quoting Gracie Slick was superb), but the thin infrastructure (i.e. lack of a plot), didn't support the better qualities of the film. The ending, to put it mildly, was a let-down. (You can't wrap up a story if there isn't one.) A Serious Man was not so much a black comedy as a blah one.
B002NPUCP8|3.0|Not really sure about this one. Maybe it will grow on me maybe not. I always try to give music a fair shot. Some CD's outright disappoint me and some I love right away (Lady GaGa, Adam Lambert, Rihanna). This one I have mixed feelings. When I listen to it I hear her mad guitar skills and I hear vocal talent but the songs themselves I could walk away from. Her guitar skills are so amazing though I will give this more time.     One month later:  Lol......I'm revisting my reviews. This one is growing on me. I still can't get over her guitar skills. She's Jimmy Hendrix reincarnated. I think she is someone you have to see live.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I am not rating the picture itself one star.  I am registering a protest vote against Summit Entertainment's practice of forcing me to sit through three lengthy previews for disinteresting garbage films before letting me get to the main menu and start Hurt Locker.  Most DVDs let you bypass extraneous material by hitting the 'Menu' button.  Not this one.  Shame on Summit.  Even if I were interested in your lame horror movie or your lamer Guy Ritchie ripoff, I'd never rent them on general principle, after having their promotional material railroaded into my living room.  If I wanted commercials I couldn't escape from, I'd not be paying for DVDs.
B002QB1910|4.0|I like it. It's a good CD. I have it in heavy rotation with GaGa & Adam Lambert. The three mesh well together with a sprinkling of Goldfrapp
0385523904|5.0|This is a powerful and unforgettable account of the lives under a Communist regime. If anyone still has illusions about communist utopias propagated in a subtle way through our educational system this book should serve as an eye opener.Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Kim Il Sung etc, all these iconic figures of the communism worshippers had same approach to subjugate an individual by fear and brutal treatment. Amazing how their victims lost their ability for independent judgement and self reliance. North Korean Republic is still a reality. It should serve as a reminder to all freedom loving Americans about the danger of the radical left. This is a must reading for our college age kids.  As we are trying to remember the Holocaust we must remember the mistake of the Communism.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I like Pink but I find I can't listen to a whole CD of hers. Something about the tone of her voice. I went to FYE music store this weekend to get recommendations for CD's from others and oddly enough the clerks in the store said the same thing. I bought the CD. It's good if you put it in shuffle with other artists and don't listen to the whole CD at once.
B002UD56I6|4.0|I found it very interesting to see how a concert is put together. Plus this shows and Michael's talent and music is outstanding.

All in all, highly recommended.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc sheds light on a very problematic food system which is creating a major health crisis in this country.  This is the film to watch if you are at all concerned about the safety and quality of our food supply.  Even if you aren't concerned, I suggest watching it.  As \\"they\\" say, knowledge is power.

B000SJHNB2|5.0|With the added crystal-clear amplification, this headphone amp makes my Sennheiser HD 595 sound even better. It is compact and well-built, and each volumne control rotates smoothly. It would be nice, however, if the Ha400 had an on-off switch.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I'm surprised that this film did not get many stars as it should have. This movie is one of my favorites and I recommend it to anyone. With MTV glorfying teenage pregnacy, this movie does not. For being a junior in high school, Juno was a woman beyond her years. She chose not to get her baby aborted and made the mature decision to put it up for adoption. It wasn't because she didnt love her child and didnt want to be a mom, but at the ripe age of 16 she was not ready to be a parent and made her decision in the best interest of her unborn child. This film is proof that pregnancy can happen to anyone, not just the lowlifes in high school. Juno wasnt the most popular, but she marched to the beat of her own drum and continued to live her life after giving birth and didnt care how others perceived her. All in all, this movie is PHENOMENAL and i highly recommend it to anyone to see.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This is a great behind the scenes true story! You really see why he was called the King of Pop.  Quick shipping and product was received in great shape.
0316017922|5.0|The basic premise of the book is that statistical outliers have as much to do with forces outside of a person--upbringing, historical context, incidental opportunities, cultural forces, and even seemingly trivial things like your birth month.     Chapter 7  Gladwell examines the case study of Korean Air, which in the 1990s, became a statistical outlier for the rate at which planes would crash. In fact, the rate was seventeen times higher than the typical American carrier. He explores different factors that may have contributed to the aberration, and eventually hones in on one particular cultural legacy that had to be addressed before the ship could be righted.    The dynamic between pilots, first officers, and engineers is typically one of strong communication and accountability. Each must be ready to speak up and take control of any given situation. But in a culture with a high \\"Power Distance Index\\"  like Korea (Gladwell explains Power Distance Index as \\"attitudes toward hierarchy, specifically with how much a particular culture values and respects authority\\"), it becomes that much harder for an apparent subordinate to speak-up to a superior. Commands are often mitigated to suggestions or implications.     Gladwell is deferential of Korean as a language: \\"There is something beautiful in the subtlety of the exchange, in the attention that each party must pay to the motivations and desires of the other.\\" But in the context of an airplane cock-pit where hundreds of lives are in the balance, and the difference between life and death can be a matter of seconds, this type of intricate dance can have deadly results. Only when Korean Air addressed these issues, and empowered its officers and engineers to take control did the situation turn around.      Chapter 9  In another case study, Gladwell examines the difference in math scores across income-demographics in standardized testing. Numbers suggested that upper or middle-class homes performed better overtime as they progressed in years. But on rehashing the numbers, the author points out that the greatest differential in scores happened in the jump from June scores to September scores, while the differences in the jump in scores from September to June were minimal across the board.     Based on that, it seemed that those that came from middle or high-class homes gained in advantage over the summer months, while they were taking lessons and in academies. The implication is that the money allocated to education reform during the school year (better teachers, technology, classroom size, and so on) might be better allocated if they went to assisting students who did not have enrichment opportunities during those traditional vacation months. And more fundamentally, Gladwell questions the wisdom of instituting a three-month hiatus from studies, while international students and high-income students were hard at work getting ahead of those that were resting.    Conclusion  Outliers is an enjoyable ride. You're at the mercy of the author's research and genius as he jumps from case study to case study in seemingly unrelated categories. But he does a great job of connecting the dots and giving the reader a clearer picture of how statistical outliers are made, so often by forces outside of themselves.
B0035J6TAI|1.0|I Don't get this at all ! Have I lost my ear for Peter? Is this the reaction he is looking for and I may understand at some point? I could not make it 15 seconds into each song without laughing, snarling, rolling my eyes or quickly reaching for the next track button, hoping and praying that the real content was yet to begin. I even recalled that there are two CD's in the special addition so I quickly looked to see if the CD I inserted was some kind on incomplete \\" making of \\" disc. But NOOOO ! This is it and what is it?  Each song sounds like a slightly inebriated lonely soul in the anonimity of his apartment, singing errantly above a neighbors somber classical music. There may as well be a dog barking, dishes breaking and a child crying along with it. I have been a strong suporter of Peters' especially during his Genesis years. Lamb is one of my top 5 works of the rock era. His abnormalities are what have attracted me over the years but this is way beyond abnormal and ,in my opinion, near unlistenable. I Don't get it !
0201633612|5.0|I should have read this years ago. I've just begun the book and it's proving an excellent review of OOP as well as a clear instruction on the use of Design Patterns. I know that these patterns will be \\"first considered\\" design solutions in projects to come. It reminds me that there is an art to software engineering. Good stuff.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is a masterwork combining phenomenal songwriting, Progressive twists, Intriguing Percussion , Melodic Cutting Guitar Work etc... etc.... etc.... Freshly dowsed with Modern Progressive Originality,though clear influences such as Queen are quite clear. This is better than Absolution and a clear indicator that these guys are getting better and better with age. Probably the most prominent take away for me musically on this CD is the classic piano works and fresh Synthesizer sounds and how well they highlight the mood of each portion of the total works as well as each song. The Vocal Melodies are also rewarding in nearly a Primal way.  I found myself absolutely moved multiple times throughout the course of this CD which is a rarity in itself these days. They could have satisfied me with any one of these songs on each of their next CD's. BUY IT and Savor IT !   Incredible ! Can't wait for the next one.
B002WY65VU|2.0|I started Zombieland expecting to laugh hysterically from beginning to end. Minus a couple Hostess and Bill Murray-related chuckles, I was rather disappointed. I'm aware that I'm in the minority here, but it didn't deliver as a horror movie or a comedy. Woody Harrelson's character was moderately funny, but the rest of the cast was pretty awful. The kid was flawed way beyond being sympathetic, well into simply pathetic, and the girls were not likable. At all. I'd have given it 1.5 stars if possible.    Bottom line, lots of people adored Zombieland, but it only made me want to watch Shaun of the Dead.
B000J6I0PM|5.0|Amazing video! If you are a big Foo Fighters fan then you will love this DVD.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|As a male, not particularly attuned to female fashion, I did appreciate and enjoy watching the hard work, energy and creativity that apparently goes into producing a world-reknowned womens' magazine.  Yes, there are some pretty interesting moments. But unless you are truly a fashion afficionado (or someone interested in photography and/or mass communications), you probably aren't going to embrace this film as a thrilling cinematic experience.
0385523904|5.0|I am one of the many who knew virtually nothing of North Korea but have been curious about it for years.  Barbara Demick has written a powerful story about ordinary people living under an unbelievably harsh and repressive regime.  The fact that none of the defectors had a political agenda lent credence to their stories for me. This book is difficult to read at times because of the primitive conditions the people lived with but I simply could not put it down.
0823015017|5.0|I'm always wary buying polymer clay books, so many are just project books and while those can be fun I want help designing original creations. Polymer Clay Color Inspirations is exactly the kind of book I love, it goes in depth with the concepts and techniques it teaches with great exercises to show you how they work. The few projects included are all gorgeous with interesting techniques that can be adapted to other projects easily. If you need help choosing colors for your projects and get stumped trying to mix good colors with your clay this book is ideal. Rather than just lists of color \\"recipes\\" it teaches you how to create your own which is much more useful.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|We love Dexter, and this season is another really good one.  We received it quickly and at a great price.  Thanks Amazon!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I almost didnt rent this one.  The trailers I had seen on TV prior and during its theatrical release, and they didnt draw me in.  It looked like some kind of quasi-SAW/evil terrorist action-drama and didnt really get to the crux of what it was about.  What a shame...<br /><br />...because this movie is actually a commentary on the legal system and frankly a populist bomb dropped in the lap of \\"The Man\\".  It wastes no time getting you to buy-in to Gerard Butler's familial angst, and perhaps unintentionally, never gets you to NOT root for the bad guy.  Despite Butler's heinous crimes, the legal system is still worse, and you end up disliking Jamie Fox's character throughout because of this.  The ending doesnt change this at all, although it really couldnt have had a different end result ultimately.  I'm trying to be vague for those that havent seen it.<br /><br />Over-the-top?  Perhaps, but it does bring to light what might happen if the right person with the right resources decided that they needed to make an example of the broken legal system, both for retribution and to strike a blow for \\"everyman\\".  In this economic and political climate, where big business and politicians get away with anything and everything, this movie is all the more poignant.<br /><br />I watched it with low expectations, but came away from it liking it as much as almost any revenge-action movie I've seen.
0345495004|5.0|This remarkable work of fiction is well worth reading for many reasons. First and foremost, it is extremely well written and very well crafted. Author, Nancy Horan, a resident of Oak Park, Illinois, spent seven years researching the material and it shows through her storytelling. Piecing together recorded history with her imagination and clear love-of-the-subject, this is one of the best books I've experienced in a long time.<br /><br />My initial interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, the man, was sparked by a childhood spent in the western suburbs of Chicago, including a stint in Oak Park, where Wright's studio remains. I can therefore appreciate the author's fascination with the reason for Wright's departure from Oak Park. She does not sugarcoat the subjects. Both Frank Lloyd Wright and his lover/mistress, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, are not entirely likeable characters. On the contrary. They are, nevertheless, as fascinating today as they were as the subjects of the sensational newspaper articles that appeared about them in the early Twentieth Century when they abandoned their spouses and children in order to pursue a life together.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those interested in historical fiction, architecture, the women's suffrage movement, and, of course, anything about Frank Lloyd Wright. It's a real eye-opener, filled with drama, reality and tragedy.
B000U0F7RG|2.0|The content of Gilmore Girls was wonderful, however the technical/mechanical value was underwhelming to say the least.  Several of the cdroms skipped during Play.  It was very disheartening to be watching and have the cdrom skip during the show(s).
0446567337|5.0|I loved this book!it made me cry 4 times!!! it is so sad and happy!this is not to be missed!
0394873742|4.0|I'm not sure why someone below suggested there is no size posting anywhere, all the items I've ever seen on amazon have a dimension posting and the main review says its two feet. ITS BIG. its fun. its engaging. my son is 28 months and its a good \\"i spy\\" book for us, thus far he hasn't found the joy in perusing it himself others experience. I like how sturdy it is however in turning it, if you aren't careful, the binding on the sides of the pages isn't great and I've separated layers.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this DVD about 3 weeks ago and have used it probably 7 times and I am already noticing huge changes in my body. The levels don't differ so much that you have to build up slowly, so I just pick a different one each time so I don't get bored. I can feel my strength increasing and the workouts are fun! I highly recommend this DVD.
B0030BOCKK|5.0|Ive been a huge H.I.M fan for years.  I have all their cds, and I think this one is great.
0312370849|4.0|After hearing all about how wonderful this book was I decided to pick one up and take a peek.   The premise of this book was of certain interest to me.  I loved the parallel stories and the fact that this book was easy to follow and read. The beginning of the book was fantastic and I did not want to put the book down. It read true to life even though it was fictional.  It is certainly a story that could have happenned and probably did. Infact, I purchased another copy for my dearest friend to read as she was recouperating from surgery.  She read it and loved it as well. The middle of this book was very good.  However the end, not so great because as I guessed all that was going to happen. Wished the writer took more creative turns with the storyline, confusing us, so the end was not as easy to figure out. I was most taken by the story of the little girl, Sarah who lived during the Holocaust. I also would have liked the story to focus more on her and give more details of her existence than it did. Maybe a part two continuing the saga would be good.  I think I would buy it. Overall, A good easy read that will keep your heart racing at times and definetly wishing for more.  I look forward to this authors next book!
B000Q6GXW2|2.0|i bought this because it was supposed to be a combo dvd, it wasn't!  Only hd-dvd.  The movie is great1  Just know ahead of time what you are really buying.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|With Absolution, Muse finally succeed in becoming the grandiose, overblown Spandau Ballet of this generation; and singer Matt Bellamy a crooner without a cause.  Sure, his deep-throated operatic bellowing may sound impressive, but ultimately it leads us nowhere new.  In my opinion Muse did all this - and did it better - with their first two albums, Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry, achieving much more in the way of clear musical diversity.    As canny readers may note, I've awarded Absolution four stars so I can't think TOO badly of it, right?   True, it's not that the individual tracks are lacking in any way - there's some brilliant music here - however taken as a whole, the album suffers from a similar problem to Radiohead's Hail to the Thief, in that both albums have too many ill-defined songs. (I only compare because both albums are the 2003 releases of bands I adore... and both feature 14 tracks).      But where as I quickly grew to know and love HTTT inside-out, Absolution often seems to drag for much longer than its fifty-two-minute running time.  Through repeated listens I've discovered that unless I'm paying strict attention to the music, many of the songs end up blending together in a sonic-boom mush, sounding quite similar to one another in style and scope.  (Ex: Apocalypse Please, Time is Running Out, Stockholm Syndrome, Butterflies and Hurricanes, all seem to be cut from the same loud, dramatically-patterned cloth).    My personal favourites on the album (though possibly unpopular choices) are 'The Small Print' and 'Endlessly'.  Next to 'Hysteria', 'tsp' is one of Absolution's punchier tracks, and is also thematically/lyrically interesting.  Meanwhile the understated 'Endlessly' exhibits some unusual rhythmic flourishes and experimental sounds.    Reading these reviews, I notice that Absolution is possibly the highest regarded of Muse's studio albums (if one can judge by the ratings and the sheer number of reviews posted) and to that end I agree that it stands head and shoulders above most of the dross that passes for music nowadays.  But it's clearly a transitional album for the band, lurking somewhere between their early alternative rock sound, but before they came out all guns blazin' with Black Holes and Revelations - musically speaking that is.
6305669651|5.0|I have read the reviews for this movie and thought I would add my two cents worth. This movie does indeed have a lot of graphic sex in it. I would rate it as XXX. THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN BY CHILDREN! On the other hand if your an adult and have read about ancient Rome than you will understand that this movie reflects Rome as it really was. Bloody, decadent and very openly sexual. I also have read that the more famous actors in this movie had no idea about the additional scenes. On the other hand I have seen an interview clip of Helen Mirren who was very much aware of and applauded the final film in its unrated form. Judge for yourself.
B001CZVVW8|3.0|Rene Fleming is outstanding as usual.  However, I had not seen the production when I bought the Blu-ray -- frankly having seen a previous production many years ago, this one is simply too minimal in character.  Onegin is a rich musical experience -- and, if you closed your eyes, the music was magnificent and wonderfully done.  The visual aspects, however, did not add to the great music.  Buy a CD instead!
0805091742|5.0|Dr. Gawande reminds us that we are all fallible and vulnerable to errors in our respective professions. He cites three professions throughout the book - surgery, construction, air travel - in which errors are particularly devastating. While developing the WHO surgical safety checklist, he sought input from construction and aerospace industry leaders and built upon the work of critical care specialist Dr. Peter Pronovost and the Keystone Initiative.<br /><br />The checklist is a simple, but powerful weapon against human fallibility and the tendency to sometimes miss the obvious. The checklist's value lies not just in the prevention of errors, but also in the facilitation of teamwork. I like the way Dr. Gawande walked the talk while bringing this tool to hospitals around the world. He didn't just tout the benefits of the surgical safety checklist; he utilized it for his own surgeries and was admittedly chagrined to find that the checklist caught potential errors.<br /><br />Dr. Gawande engages the reader with riveting accounts of lifesaving surgery feats and airline rescues, culminating in the story of the Miracle on the Hudson. What seems to be a dry topic at first glance is surprisingly enthralling. A great read for both medical professionals and laypersons. Well done!
0307271862|1.0|It is sometimes claimed that a few authors become so popular that even large, powerful  publishers cannot exercise any editorial control.  It seems to me that this theory   may be true and that this author's most recent novel is evidence to that effect.    The translation is slapdash, clunky and not fun to read.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I can recall the first place I heard Grizzly Bear was in my local CVS. Just browsing, I heard their song \\"two weeks\\" and was jerked out of my headspace, said to my husband, \\"That song is amazing\\". Thought, too bad I can't find out who they are. Like a week later, heard the song in a car commercial, and was so excited that I had a way to identify it. Since identifying the band, I have repetitively listened to their free streaming songs. I have read some negative reviews that claim the music and anyone who gets it are music snobs. Maybe some are; maybe some are just music educated. I readily admit that I have a bachelor's degree in music, but as I have said I'm not a snob. You can take my word on this, because most classical musicians sneer at the very idea that rock music might hold a candle to classical. I think they are just apples and oranges. The thought behind classical pretension is that popular music isn't as complex and therefore not as good. I think that bands like Grizzly Bear are so appreciated, because it is that rare beast (pun intended). It is a band that deserves it's raves because it's songs show a real talent for song construction; a true understanding of melody, harmony, rythym, dynamics, phrasing, lyrics etc. I am truly transported, because their craftsmanship takes me to an elevated place. I can't even believe pretension even enters the discussion when we are constantly bombarded by an industry that almost has nothing to do with musicianship anymore. I'd really hate to see such a talented group of actual musicians' rating go down because of the same kind of elitism and reactionary hatred of elitism that exists in the classical music world. I, for one, believe that good music is good music, and Grizzly Bear, most definitely...is.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I cannot tell you how exciting this album is to me. I'm a bit shocked to be able to say that - considering that it is, at heart, a covers album and a Gabriel album without the percussion so essential to his other work.  We hear only suggestions of the original songs in Gabriel's interpretations (with the exception of \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\", which bares resemblance to Randy Newman's original) - and we certainly hear something very much like \\"Gabriel songs\\", regardless of the other songwriters and instrumentation.     Scratch My Back is as nakedly painful and loving and fragile and dark as almost anything Gabriel's done - by which I mean his voice, his performance, the brilliantly unpredictable arrangements are just out there between our eyes and in our chest, and we *feel* it. While it goes to a lot of places and sounds, there is no Sledgehammer here (which I don't say to slam Sledge or this album). It's not timid - it gets raucous, but it doesn't rock (it doesn't try to). Though the album may not dance with you, it will alternately hold you, grab and shake you and stare uncomfortably at you.    I could not make it through the album without replaying songs and then parts of songs again - and I'm dying to play the whole thing again as I write. That is a great thing to say (and something I can't pretend I say often). I don't want to take it apart bit by bit - take it in yourself. I do think it's outstanding.
B002QEISMA|5.0|I can not stop listening to this CD. It is amazing. Probably one of, if not the best album in my collection. Every song is superb and unique from start to finish. When I listen to it, I never skip any songs - like I do with many other albums. I can't recommend this masterpiece enough.

I alos really loved the cast for this one. George Clooney is perfect as Foxy. Ash and Kristofferson are great characters. Bill Murray as the Badger is perfect as well. I don't think they could have done this one any better. Even the music is great! I would highly recommend this to anyone that's a fan of comedy and animation.
0590210548|5.0|My grandsons love this book and so do I.  The details of the book are almost magical.  The animals have toys and books in their cages.  The keys on the key rings match up to the colors of the cages.  As the animals follow \\"Mr. and Mrs. Zookeeper\\"  across the lawn the neighbors in the windows of one of the houses go from one, to two, to three.  The colors are beautiful and it is an enjoyable experience for the reader no matter what his age.  I am buying this book for all the special people in my life who have children, just like I do the Shel Silverstein books.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing, so I liked it.<br /><br />I'd probably suggest this to other fans looking for something to read during breaks of the show and those who want to learn more.

0545123267|2.0|(The below has some spoilers in it)  This a book about a girl named Grace who was bitten by a wolf, but unlike others who have been bitten she never changed into a wolf. AND about a young man named Sam who was also bitten but has spent his life changing b/t wolf and human form. No one knows why she never changed, but Sam who met Grace 6 year prior when she was bitten, has watched an loved Grace from a distance in his wolf form. The town starts worrying about the wolves when a young man named Jack is \\"killed\\" by a wolf. The town decides that it is time to kill the wolves. In his attempts to survive Sam is shot ... shortly after Grace finds him on her back porch in his human form. She takes him to the hospital and that is when their romance really starts. For rest of the book they try to enjoy their time together, loving each other. They also attempt to find Jack ... who apparently has been receiving help from one of Grace's friends Olivia, though Grace does not learn of this until after Jack bites Olivia. Soon, with the help of Jake's sister Isabel and Beck (Sam's guardian when he is human) Grace tries to help Jake and Sam burn the wolf \\"bug\\" out of them. Olivia decides that she would rather be a wolf than take the risks that are associated with the \\"experiment\\" to keep her human. Sam wants to try and does ... in the end Jake dies, Olivia becomes a happy wolf and Sam becomes Human. The Book is like an Oreo ... the first and last 20-30 pages are the best part of the entire book !!     Personal Opinion about the Book:  The book begins in a catchy way that gets you interested in learning more about each character. But in the following 300+ pages your balloon of excitement is deflated! The writing is lack luster ... not original and barely able to hold a readers attention. Grace is obsessed about the wolves and it makes no sense ... until much later. There is sexual tension b/t the characters but they spend too much time think about it \\"I want to kiss her\\" or \\"I should kiss him\\" or I wished we kissed\\". After a while you just wished they thought about it less and just kissed! The supposed death of Jake, the bad boy of the H.S., is a great opening of a villain that is slow to develop and eventually does not develop. In the first 200 pages Sam gushes about his mentor Beck and you get this image of a great person ... until you meet him and within a few pages you are disgusted and let down by his character. The book has few exciting moments. Few details. Few moments of enjoyment. You don't learn about how Sam got changed until late, and the lateness of many ideas is a continuing problem in the book.  The only part of the book that I enjoyed was the end and the last 20+ pages.     WARNING: if you pick up this book (unless you're like me and feel obligated to complete it) you will put it down and allow spider webs to form after the first 50 pages ... or sooner.  I give this book a 2/5 stars because it has TOO many flaws and disappointments. It is not interesting (at all). Now that I've completed it I have no desire to read any more novels by Maggie Stiegvater. When LINGER, the sequel to SHIVER is released, I will save my money, time and emotions and just wait for the Internet summary of it to learn what happens to Sam and Grace.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|The original Superman II was not bad if you like action and stunts (that have been repeated hundreds of times since 1980). Even though this Donner Cut is less focused on stunts and gags, it is more thought provoking thanks to the continuation of the Reeves-Brando dialogue. Case in point: in the theatrical version Superman's dad is replaced by his mom in the Temple of Solitude. Even though this actress did a fine job, one cannot help but wonder where the father is, especially after seeing his projected image in numerous instances, in the first Donner movie's DVD. With this version the father is chastising the son for sacrificing his powers, like any father might feel after bestowing a powerful gift to his only son. Now some may say love is more noble than any super powers, which is true, but Lois was NOT the right woman for him. Isn't it obvious? When Clark got thrashed by the thug in the diner Lois says that she wished he were the superman that she had fallen in love with. I can just imagine Clark, all bloodied on the floor, thinking, \\"Soooo, you were only in love with my powers, and not my Clark Kent dorkiness? What an imbecile I am! Father was right!\\" In fact, the last line of that scene where Clark finds out about Zod, and he says that \\"he\\" knew, \\"he\\" told, but \\"I didn't listen,\\" this Donner cut makes one realize that \\"he\\" is Superman's father. It comes together! There is more God and redemption themes in the Donner editions of Superman than any other superhero movies out there now. From a secular director like Donner? Go figure!    Another improvement to this edition is the wonderful office scenes between Lois and Clark, with Lois even jumping out a window. What a treat to see this after 25 years!    The best new dramatic scene is when Lois exposes Clark as Superman, by shooting him with blanks. This is such a better version than the original dumb one where Superman \\"accidentally\\" trips over a pink bear into a fire. Lame!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Put aside all the campy gadgets and poor humor, trade the glossy chicmobile in for a ...black....tank, forget the \\"BAM! SOCK! AND POW!\\" cue cards, add a dash of Morgan Freeman, a cup of Katie Holmes, an exceptionally English Michael Caine, Liam Neeson as an uncommonly convincing villain, and Christian Bale as the most believable Batman ever and you have the perfect recipe for the redemption of what Batman always should have been!    What makes any movie great and worth watching is story - Christopher Nolan and company knocked this one out of the park. It is a rare occasion for me to buy a movie for my collection at home. It HAS to have a great story, it has to make me forget I'm watching a movie, it has to make me care about the characters, it has to have a great score, it has to take me from the quiet burbs to some great locations and it has to be something I want to watch over and over again ~ This one came home with no reservation ~    To quote Dr. Schneider (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) This movie had me \\"giddy as a school boy!\\" from start to finish.    To quote the guys that get paid to say this kind of stuff, \\"Two Thumbs Way Up!\\"

B002C6A6N6|5.0|Simply put, Dr Quinn - the complete series - has withstood the test of time and moves into the genre of classic. Well-written scripts, fine actors, and lush scenery make for a quality product. The issues presented are as fresh today as they were when originally aired. The acting brings laughter, tears, and contemplative thought to those who watch. This series clearly demonstrates the creativity possible that television is capable of producing for the viewing audience. Kudos to the Beth Sullivan Company.
B0035G04O8|5.0|This book really set the pace of my marriage. My husband and I read this book about 2 months into our marriage and what an eye opener. Without it I don't know if we would be as happily married as we are today. We read tons of marriage books when we were newly weds and this one was really the only beneficial one. It is still one that stays in the back of our minds and one we go back to when we need a reminder on how to best show our love for the other person. We've been married for over 3 years now and are still completely in love and this book really played an important role in that!

0792843584|2.0|Please note that I saw this on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer. But it was the \\"director's cut\\" with the extra footage.<br /><br />I'm easily entertained when it comes to movies, and was prepared to like this film, which chronicles the land wars between the poor immigrant homesteaders and the wealthy cattle ranchers in 1890s Montana, despite all I'd heard about it. But unfortunately I have to say the movie's somnambulistic reputation is well deserved. In fact, the list of the movie's shortcomings reads like a recipe for how to actually make a bad movie, and this from the director of the previous much acclaimed film, The Deerhunter.<br /><br />Yes, this movie really is a turkey, and of truly banquet-sized proportions. If it were a real gobbler, it would feed a family of 12 for a month. As it was, this movie gobbled up United Artists which went bankrupt when the original ten million dollar budget ballooned to almost 40 million (about 100 million in today's dollars) in Cimino's hot hands.<br /><br />First among its defects is the incomprehensible story line, which is disjointed, confusing, and fudges many of the actual historical facts (such as the fact that two of the main characters in the movie were dead by the time the movie's events actually happened). Not being deterred by any semblance to real historical events, Cimino proceeded to film it in brownish, dark sepia tones which looks like it was shot through a wet cow patty. Sepia can certainly give a classy or historic look, sometimes, but then many of the scenes are shot with enough heavy dust or smoke so that you can't see what's going on very well, anyway. All this does is to show great clouds of sepia-toned smoke and dust.<br /><br />Then there is the glacial pacing of the movie, which is about as fast as a horned toad on Quaaludes.*** The sepia color just adds to the overall sluggish, dreary ambience of the movie. Quite honestly, I think the movie would have looked better in a more normal color. Next is the poor quality of the sound track, which pumps up the bass and the treble frequencies but renders incomprehensible the mid-range, which is where most of the actor's voices are--no doubt so that you can't hear the mediocre scipt (which I'll get to in a moment). The result is that you can barely hear the dialog throughout much of the movie. I've heard Edison wax cylinder recordings from a hundred years ago where the voices were more intelligible.<br /><br />The script is about as exciting as the want ads in your local newspaper, and despite the all-star cast, the acting is largely uninspired and uninteresting. Often the actors themselves look like they're painfully aware of just how bad the script is. And as for the title, Heaven's Gate, the only thing heavenly about this movie is how fast the executives at United Artists were probably precipitated to their unearthly reward from early heart attacks when they realized that they had financially destroyed their company by bankrolling this colossal cinematic disaster.<br /><br />We're supposed to empathize with the poor immigrants, but they're portrayed as an obnoxious, churlish lot with about as much charm as a Cockney fishwife (who can at least speak English, in contrast to the people here who seem to be speaking mostly German and Russian--and without subtitles), and who look like the rejects from the famous Mos Eisely Station bar scene in the first Star Wars movie.<br /><br />Lest you think I'm exaggerating about the nonsensical story line, to take just one example, about an hour into the movie there's a scene where Kristofferson's character comes home to his lady friend, who serves him a piece of pie. In the middle of eating his pie, and without any other indication, she suddenly strips off her clothes in the kitchen and dashes for the bedroom. Kristofferson hurriedly gulps down the last couple of bites of his pie while his wife waits impatiently under the covers, and then makes a mad dash forthe bedroom himself. Time for the real desert, I guess. LOL. No doubt this scene was unintentionally funny.<br /><br />Shortly after that, the neighbors appear half nekkid at their door, wondering what's going on next door. Then for a little, hard-core realistic dialog, I guess, the mother yells from the front door, \\"What the [...] is going on?\\" I kid you not. People didn't talk like that in the old west. I expected to start hearing things like, \\"Hey dude, how's it hangin'?\\" as if it were the Haight-Ashbury \\"Summer of Love\\" from 1968, but fortunately that was left out--which is about all that was left out of this long, drawn-out, meandering movie.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the beautiful cinematography of Zigmos Dsigmond, certainly one of the great talents of this period--which is why the two stars instead of one--but unfortunately it's wasted on this self-indulgent, confusing, poorly scripted, poorly acted, overblown, mess of a movie. Run, don't walk, from this movie before the experience brands you like just another ordinary head of cattle.<br /><br />***Steve Hellerstedt's review makes a similar comment--check out this excellent review too.LOL.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I thought this version was too short and rushed through to the end. There were admittedly some parts that were very different from the book but I still loved it!!! For being as condensed as it is, I think they did a fantastic job getting the emotion, the looks and the true agony of the characters. This is what makes me want to watch this movie over and over again, especially on those sad rainy days =).
0618918248|2.0|The best thing about this book is a substantial reference to thinkers and their thoughts.  Get out your dictionary and have your Internet search engine ready.  All high school American history class students should demand to read not just pro and con, but the rest of the story that is being told.  This is a good, educational example for them to use.  People will never learn how to think for themselves until they can spot someone who is attempting to think for them with phrases like \\"statistically possible\\" and \\"law of [Insert the advanced scientifically proven theory name here].\\"  \\"Natural science\\" only means that it is what we are used to observing in nature. All things, observed long enough, have a nature about them.  In my opinion, the phrase \\"natural science\\" is deceptively authoritative to children and adults alike.  Please review that for yourself.<br /><br />The most negative thing about this book is that it is a 400 plus page lecture that can easily be summarized in three points.  1.  Numbers, i.e., statistical numbers, are the best godfather available to all of us.  2.  Given time, and gradual steps, by purely natural laws (i.e., Darwin's natural selection!), the statistical probability of evolution marches forward and upward because large numbers of slightly improbable agents add up to accumulation of the possiblity of anything, i.e., evolution.  3.  If you don't agree with what Mr. Dawkins holds, you are a/an/some [Insert adjective(s) and euphemism for bad person plus noun of  Mr. Dawkin's choice Here] in need of having your `consciousness raised.'<br /><br />Do you like numbers?  Does even mention of statistics have the effect of increasing your belief in the presence of infallible fact?  Do you accept statistical probability on hearsay evidence?  Can numbers say what ever you want them to in favor of probability?  Have I got a book for you.<br /><br />God is irreducibly complex, and that flaw makes him unacceptable to Mr. Dawkins.  God cannot be reduced to a numerical equation or tested as a law of science.  I had really hoped to find some meat in this book.  Instead, I found observation, rigged examples, hearsay quotes, lack of citation and footnotes, absolutist opinion, and manipulation.<br /><br />If Mr. Dawkins could have scored a quote from Beelzebub himself, he would have gladly printed it and followed through with condemning Satanism as part of the problem with the CARB (Catch-All Religion Bucket).  On pages 56-57, Mr. Dawkins declares that God and gods are all the same to him and under his `attacking.'  Therefore, he will treat all three Abrahamaic religions `as indistinguishable' (i.e., Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) (see pg. 58).  He creates the CARB, with the same logic that \\"No one is perfect; all people are bad because they are different and not perfect.  I am correct.  All people should be killed.\\"  If Mr. Dawkins were God, we'd all be... well, dead.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins uses quotes from some real bottom feeders in the university system of Great Britain with impressive titles.  No one is immune:  the pacifist, religious apologist, deist, theist, Catholic, Muslim, Jew, Quaker, Protestant, Christian, theology.  See Mr. Dawkins on page 56 where he has a Catholic meltdown and page 80 for theologians to get their comeuppance.  Changing definitions to accommodate Mr. Dawkins personal use the God hypothesis on page 52 that is then altered on page 82 because there are `many versions of the hypothesis.'  How convenient.  Now we can't tell if the God Hypothesis was Mr. Dawkins name for it, or his name for their name for it.  But then, they will translate to anything and anyone in the CARB.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins time travels.  There is a forum for anachronistic politics.  For example, Mr. Dawkins tells us what the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson (and others) would be about events that are more recent. Mr. Dawkins quotes the atheist Nehru and to my surprise, even what Nehru thought he said isn't what he said.The lecture is filled with haphazard illustrative quotations, self-made and manipulated definitions, angry absolutisms, and an allegedly scientific appeal to the intelligence of real thinkers.<br /><br />The section devoted to the widely held idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation should be required reading in all high school American history classes.  It's not that Dawkins takes it out of context, he takes it out of the greater picture of historical application.  The book segment on the document of Treaty of Tripoli, Article 11, and the Musselmen (use the dictionary for that one if it is not familiar) on pgs. 60-61 will not tell you that the Treaty of Tripoli was on the books for 8 years, then renegotiated, and Article 11 was dropped.  It was put in the document to avoid a religious war between the Muslims of Tripoli and a young America circa 1796.  You would have put in whatever you needed to in order to stem piracy and a declaration of war against you.<br />Read \\"Treaty of Tripoli by David Barton\\" - [...].  All high school American history class students should demand to read not just pro and con, but to read the rest of the story that is being told.  This is a good educational example for them to use.<br /><br />You don't have to think, just believe as Mr. Dawkins does.  His thought process isn't easy to follow unless you're already angry.  If you're not angry when you start reading, you will be later with his subtle (and not subtle at all) snipes, snarks, and condescension.<br /><br />The word religion is used in a continuous feed loop that appeals to anyone who doesn't catch on that religion is a handy straw man for all the world's evils.  For Mr. Dawkins purposes, all gods are the same (once again, page  57), and every expression of belief that contains any pro theological reference goes in the CARB (once again, Catch-All Religion Bucket).The lecture is filled with haphazard illustrative quotations, self-made and manipulated definitions, angry absolutisms, and an allegedly scientific appeal to the intelligence of real thinkers.<br /><br />The section devoted to the widely held idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation should be required reading in all high school American history classes.

Special effects are weak (e.g., USS John F Kennedy washing onto the White House - doh!). Movie's situations are contrived and disjointed and too many. All-in-all, a lousy film.

B0035J6TAI|1.0|I can remember when Peter Gabriel was an important artist who wrote great and influential music.  What happened?!!!  Where is the artist who wrote Solisbury Hill, Biko, Games Without Frontiers, Red Rain, Come Talk to Me?  I can remember traveling in England and being absolutely thrilled when some on a bus pointed out Solisbury Hill as we passed by and wishing we could get off the bus right there.  On this disc Gabriel takes some great songs and some truly obscure ones and sucks every bit of life out of them.  This disc creeps along with one dreary dirge following another. This is a painful and boring experience.  When a major artist releases a disc this bad you have to wonder how self-absorbed he has become.

B00338QENI|4.0|I don't normally read nonfiction except for how to books. This phenomenal piece of journalism was a can't put it down read, something I usually reserve for truly special novels. The family is so well developed, the result of Ms. Skloot working with them and getting to know them over the course of many years; you know them as well as any character in a well told tale. Her writing is clear, she explains the science in a way that I could understand. She did the same for the legal issues and more importantly, the race issues including the horrible treatment of blacks by the medical establishment.  The only downside was for the long and fairly dry epilogue, but maybe this is normal in this type of book.<br /><br />I'm not African-American, nor am I a scientist or a lawyer, but through this engaging book, I feel so much better informed about so many topics. My heart goes out to the Lacks family.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Dark City has always been one of my favorite films since I started to seriously watch movies. I had always been a big fan of this film but always hated the opening narration. In the tradition of Blade Runner, which had equally abysmal elements that were perfected in a home video version, Dark City Director's Cut ditches the narration and immediately drops you into this fascinating world. There are also a few scenes that were added to flesh out other aspects of the story. I'm glad that we finally have a version of Dark City that is not dumbed down for the masses who needed the entire plot explained in the opening minutes. I can only wonder how it would have been to experience this version for the first time. By fusing classic sci-fi themes, an interesting post-modern art direction, and pulp detective fiction, Proyas has created a sci-fi film distinctly his own and one I feel everyone should watch.     Many reviews have criticized the picture quality as bad or not great because of Digital Noise Reduction but I can only sit in awe at how amazing the film looks on blu-ray. The remastered presentation makes me look at the film in a whole new way. It makes me appreciate the subtleties of Dariusz Wolski's amazing cinematography. The black levels are excellent and there's plenty of that to see in this film. Detail is extremely also high.    The film also sports an immersive 7.1 track. The mix gives you a great sense of environment, highlighting the excellent score of the film.     This blu-ray is also jam-packed with excellent bonuses also. Some notable ones include:  3 new commentaries for the director's cut version (including an excellent must-hear commentary from film critic Roger Ebert.) The commentaries from the DVD are also ported over for the theatrical cut. A brief but informative intro with Director Alex Proyas. A great behind the scenes doc about production and the film's reception. There's also a sort of interesting doc on post-modernism and how it affected DarkCity and other sci-fi.    Anyone who enjoyed The Matrix deserves to also give Dark City a try. Anyone interested in sci-fi can't go wrong with Dark City and this amazing blu-ray.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is an off-the-wall series about a high school chemistry professor  who comes down with lung cancer, and who resorts to drastic measures to provide for his eclectic family in case he dies.   Now, don't be turned off by this subject:  This series is extremely well-written, with outstanding production by Vince Gilligan and Mark Johnson.   The inimitable Bryan Cranston plays the lead role, accompanied by Aaron Paul as his often-aggravating side-kick.   Breaking Bad is simply bizarre, and at the same time has an underlying sense of humor, despite the subject matter.  It's so hard to explain what's good, better yet GREAT, about Breaking Bad.  I guess it's that rare combination of great writing, unparalleled acting, combined with a totally unique subject matter, that takes this series over the top.  AMC deserves accolades for presenting this truly original series.  If you like mature drama, get BREAKING BAD.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here, but this documentary is just plain boring. It's kinda cool to see each musician play at first, but the longer the movie goes on, the more you realize there is no over-arching POINT to any of it. It's basically just one giant mash-up. It could have been a great movie if it just had something -- ANYTHING -- to say. Instead it just piddles away a couple of hours without making any kind of real impression.

0307271862|3.0|This book kept me interested all the way through, and had me on the edge of my seat the last 50 pages or so.  But I did not find it a high quality read and I believe that part of the problem lies in the translation.  With a good translation, the reader is not terribly conscious he is reading a translation because the writer's original words and the translator's choice of words skillfully jell.  Not so with this translation.  The translator seems to be groping for words at times; sometimes the wrong words seem to be chosen.  So it is difficult to review this particular book because one does not know how accurate the writer's manuscript is depicted when translated into another language.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book for me is the history it reveals, both of the construction of the transcontinental railway in the United States in the 19th century, and the history of China, both after the revolution and before.  What puzzles me greatly is that there is a great deal of discussion among modern day Chinese about the past and future of China, yet not in one single one of these discussions is the invasion of Tibet, or even Tibet as a country, ever mentioned.  Even the topic of Tiananmen Square comes up.  But not Tibet.  It is as though the country does not even exist.<br /><br />The main character, a middle-aged Swedish judge in a marriage gone sterile, is supposed to be intelligent, yet she performs some blundering and careless acts that stretch the limits of the reader's credulity.  There are other instances in the book that I found to be quite beyond the boundaries of believability.<br /><br />I have not read any other novel of Henning Mankell, but since his books have won many prestigious awards, I assume that some of them are excellent.  I do not, however, find this particular offering to meet top-notch standards.

A reminder of the evil that we are capable of doing, but also, the good. The best book I've read in many years.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|all parents should watch this movie and realize the way they need to feed their children.  Know where your food comes from and how it is processed.  I have not eaten any legged animals since.  A hard movie to watch, but worth it.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|I agree with many perspectives of all the reveiws that have been posted.I probably will sound like a classic rock cheerleader, but just enjoy the mastery of this ledgendary band. Do not be over critical, this is a classic reguardless. We as fans should feel blessed that the Priest still rocks our lives!!! I have been a fan since 1976, and now in 2010 I can not wait for the next tour. I do not expect any reveiwers to feel the same way that I do , but I know there is!!!! Keep rockin Judas Preist for I am a loyal fan.

B00005RIKI|5.0|I'm not a connousieur (sp) of Southern rock.  A slice is good enough for me. But once i woke up to Lynyrd Skynyrd's greatness about 15 years ago, long after their glory days, I realized their big hits really did come from a well of talent that can't be overlooked by Northern boys like me.  After a while,  a greatest hits collection wasnt good enough...I wanted to dip into the well with at least one album, and this is the one. It doesn't have Sweet Home Alabama, but it has three other monsters that people always think of when they think of LS: Gimme Three Steps, Simple Man, and Free Bird.  And it's got the lesser stuff that make an album a real experience that takes you back to the time and place.  Get this if that is what you are looking for.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|It is rare to find a film that has such depth - of character, history, and humanity.<br /><br />First, you have a tragic love story, of a married woman who falls for a charming yet difficult and obsessed man, a scholar explorer who lacks many basic social graces.  With perfect success, Fiennes is sensual, austere, funny, full of life, prickly, sensitive, egotistical, lonely, and passionate.  Thomas is stunningly beautiful in her prime, a lonely married woman desiring to burst her bounds yet unprepared for the consequences.  The chemistry between them is electric and immediate, of the kind that is experienced once in a lifetime - if you are lucky.  Their passion is an archetype of hope, momentary fulfillment, and failure.  The evocation is truly wonderful.<br /><br />Second, you have the backdrop of WWII, which erased entire cultures and ruined so many lives.  Fiennes and his cohort are explorers dedicated to finding archaeological truth, refusing to believe in nationality and bridging cultures with a naive love of diversity in the declining colonial age.  Their ethereal ideals are beautiful, hypocritical, used by intelligence services for their war aims, and yet timeless.  All of this is encapsulated in the background, a perfectly realized mood poem.  Every image of the film, particularly in the desert sequences but also the ruined monastery, is consistent with this.<br /><br />Third, there are the ideals and conflicts of humanity.  I know this sounds a bit high-faluttin, but the brief romance of the nurse (Binoche) and the Sik (Andrews) brings it into focus:  after all the death she has seen, she is ambivalent about life, while her lover is deeply conflicted about his identity as an Asian serving colonial masters.  Somehow they find a way to move forward.  She also loves the dying Fiennes, whose life she hopes will save her soul.  But the evolution of the character of Defoe - the seeker of vengeance for unspeakable war crimes - is much the same, finding brotherhood and some forgiveness while accepting meaningless tragedy.  Once again, the film brings this off - causing refection and awe in the viewer - without pretension or a feeling a lugubrious over-plotting.<br /><br />The non-linear unfolding of the plot is also successful:  Binoche is caring for Fiennes in a ruined monastery, mourning while hoping to find light again, when an unwanted visitor appears, the wounded Defoe.  He begins to snoop around, asking questions and stealing morphine, while Fiennes indulges in a swirl of memories as he declines.  Slowly, a full story of his tragedy emerges, while the younger characters find a way to move on with their lives.<br /><br />Rarely does a film evoke the passing of life amidst big events so completely.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Amazing insight to how the food industry is ran like a business and is corupt.  This film makes you second guess and question what you are eating and more importantly what you are feeding your kids.  I already knew a lot of what they were saying but it was still very interesting research.  It is also good to hear that there are farmers out there who care for the environment and other people and not just a pay check.

B0033AX20E|5.0|Having already owned and listened to the original version of this album, I must say I am very pleased with this reissue. The songs are 'remixed and remastered.' Whereas the original album had a relatively poor production quality compared to their recent works, EVERYTHING sounds better this time around. The instrumentals and vocals sound great - crisp and clear, no static or bumps like the original. Highly recommended for fans of DragonForce and power metal in general.

B0017MO10U|4.0|This was a great continuation story.  I love that they are going on like nothing is wrong, and that life continued. So many series kill off or rap things up so it makes it tough to see what would happen next.  I have to admit IM jones for more SG1, and this was a great way to calm my jitters for a week or so. the story is a time traveling story line, which in true SG-1 fasion finally puts Ben Broder in to play.  Jack also makes an apperance so it was good to see him.
B0030U1TW0|5.0|Many (many!) year ago a friend of mine who was a huge fan of Gentle Giant (he had every album that the Shulman brothers had ever made in every incarnation, went to all their shows, and I think he even knew them - he was a studio musician himself) told me this story, that he said was the concept for this album. I've never seen this anywhere else so take it with a grain of salt:<br /><br />The story is about this guy who does a lot of bad things. One day he turns aorund without thinking about it and notices that the light in another room turns on, then off suddenly. He starts to think that something is going on behind his back that he's not aware of. So he starts practicing turning around without thinking about it, doing it randomly and unexpectedly.<br /><br />Then one day he turns around without thinking about it, and he sees the devil standing behind him. And realizes then that the devil has been controlling his life, making him do all the bad things he's been doing. Realizing that he's been controlled he frees himself of the devil's control.<br /><br />Anyway, hope I didn't mess it up too much retelling it. I heard that in 78. And it sort of fits I think. This group did make a lot of fine albums.
0307269981|5.0|What an amazing sequel, great action, suspense, and attention to detail. The characters are deep and vivid - the plot developement insainely creative.  I love these books and can't WAIT for the 3rd one to come out.<br /><br />If you tired of reading DAN BROWN books and want a little Swedish spice and controversy read this book !
1600243916|5.0|I work in the material handling (forklift) business for Briggs Equipment.  I found this book to be insightful and applicable to any business and personal situation.  I have recommended it to numerous people.  It brings to light the idea that outliers are actually opportunists that work hard at something and become experts.  Being an expert takes some talent, some timing and absolutely 10,000 hours or more of practice.  In our business we have techs with well over 10,000 hours and they are truly experts.  Great book applicable to daily life.  Read and enjoy.
B00005R62K|5.0|Judas Priest's 4th album, Stained Class, is another incredible release by one of my most favorite bands ever. This album was voted the Heaviest Metal Album of All Time in 2004 by Metal Hammer, a music magazine in the UK. Stained Class is also considered by many to be the first real Heavy Metal album ever made. Is it? Who knows and who cares?! I'm no Metal Music expert by any means, and I personally have to give the nod to Black Sabbath because in my opinion they beat Judas Priest to the punch, but regardless, I do know this much, this album flat out rocks, and rocks heavy, and that is all that really matters when you get right down to it.<br /><br />Stained Class is track after track of awesome sounds that right from the very beginning grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go until the very end. If the amazing guitar work and drums don't hold your interest, surely Rob Halford's incredible vocals will. And if not, you might just want to check your pulse.<br /><br />A notable fact concerning this album is that it features a song that caused quite a bit of trouble for Judas Priest who were brought into court over it. The song was claimed to contain subliminal messages that caused two youths to go into a suicide pact. One died, the other lived but was horribly disfigured, and eventually died a couple of years later due to complications. The songs title is Better By You, Better Than Me, and was originally written by Gary Wright of Dream Weaver fame.<br /><br />A lot of fans agree that Beyond The Realms of Death is the best song on the album, and it's definitely a masterpiece song for sure. All the songs on here are excellent really, but, if I had to pick my most favorite one out of them all, I'd have to go with Saints in Hell. The song is truly epic in every sense of the word. Halford's haunting vocals and wailing screeches match perfectly the eerie and heavy guitar riffs that transport you to the depths of Hell itself on a Holy mission with the Saints to recover a sacred relic. It's truly one of Judas Priest's best songs ever, and Stained Class is definitely one of Judas Priest's all-time best albums.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: Exciter, White Heat Red Hot, Stained Class, Invader, Saints in Hell, and Beyond The Realms of Death.of Judas Priest's best songs ever, and Stained Class is definitely one of Judas Priest's all-time best albums.    Standout Tracks are: Exciter, White Heat Red Hot, Stained Class, Invader, Saints in Hell, and Beyond The Realms of Death.

B000000W6X|5.0|I can't believe people say this is their lowest album.  This is my absolute favorite Massive Attack album and the one I keep going back to all the time.  I had a lot of the singles before I even got the album from Itunes.  The songs on this are hauntingly beautiful, and it actually sounds like a soundtrack.  I have in fact called this album \\"the soundtrack of my life\\". Three is such an amazing song on it's own and should have been a front-runnner of the album, although the track Protection is also magical.

0446567337|4.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks' novel that I've ever read, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard that his books are tear-jerkers, and I was armed with a box of Kleenex when I began this book. Although I didn't actually cry, there were a couple of parts that made me tear up.      I was pretty impressed with Spark's writing style. It flowed well and was fairly easy to read, but it was deep and meaningful at the same time. The best word to describe the story is bittersweet. In a way, the story was incredibly sad, and I was disappointed in the characters for not trying to stay together longer. At the same time, I understood how hard the circumstances were, and I was proud of them for trying as hard as they could. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but I found parts of the story really disheartening. I'm so used to the teen chick lit where everything ends with a happily-ever-after. It was a bit startling to realize that those don't always exist. That's what made this book so realistic.     Although I didn't bond with all of the characters, they were all very realistic. What I loved most about them was that they were flawed. No too-perfect Edward Cullen types here. John was an average guy, and while Savannah might not seem like your usual college student, I admired her faith and selflessness.    This book should come with a warning label that reads \\"BEWARE: THIS NOVEL MAY BREAK YOUR HEART.\\" I learned that true love doesn't always lead to a happy ending. Still, I'm glad I read this; it opened my eyes to the meaning of true love.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|In my opinion, no adaptation of a Jane Austen novel can ever hold a candle to the Colin Firth version of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" That said, I quite enjoyed this version of \\"Persuasion\\"--even with its several flaws.     What I enjoy most about it (besides seeing Rupert Penry-Jones as Wentworth!) is all of the staring. Anne and Wentworth do a lot of staring here; and they stare directly at us, allowing us momentary, unguarded access to their private misery. Penry-Jones is especially adept at communicating with his eyes the years of heartache Wentworth endured but thought he had conquered as well as the fresh wounding of his heart each time he is in her company. Sally Hawkins's Anne has many more opportunities to stare than Wentworth; but she does it so often that it doesn't always achieve the desired effect of granting us access to her emotions but, instead, results in our feeling that we have intruded on her privacy. Still, she seems more aware of our presence than does Wentworth; so she is more intentional in her stares.    I agree with others that Anne's running through the streets of Bath is ridiculous. The first time I saw the scene, I took it literally. However, after watching it several more times, I am convinced that it might've been meant as a visual representation of what was going on in Anne's mind rather than what her body was doing. But if that is the case, the technique wasn't successful since so many people have taken it so literally. Too much happens during Anne's gallop through Bath. Surely she would've overtaken Wentworth before he returned to the admiral's quarters, wrote the note, charged Harvel with delivering it, escorted his sister and the admiral to take the waters, and struck up a conversation with Charles Musgrove. If Anne were actually running willy nilly in public, why didn't anyone on the street gauk at her in surprise? I mean, how many nineteenth-century baronet's daughters could they expect to see running full-tilt? Her friends--the Crofts, Mrs. Smith, Charles, Wentworth--are only mildly surprised by her dashing about. Charles feins interest in why she burst upon the scene, but easily talks himself out of it. In reality they would've expected to hear Anne tell them about a matter of life or death. Also, Anne's ability to run at break-neck speed for so long a distance would have taken training as a marathoner, especially as we see her recover so quickly once she has found Wentworth. So I'm \\"persuaded\\" that she didn't run at all.     I see a huge flaw in the story with regard to the sale of the Elliot estate. If I am not mistaken, British primogeniture prevented heirs from selling property and thereby depriving future heirs of their birthright. Heirs have possession of the property during their lifetime; but upon their death, the estate and title pass to the next male in line. Anne's father had no authority to sell the estate even if the money-loving Elliot cousin were to agree to it. and Wentworth had no power to buy it.    The casting is, for the most part, is well done. In my opinion, only Anne's sisters are miscast. Mary is a goofball, when there is no need of comic relief. Julia Davis was 41 when she played the part of the 29-year-old Elizabeth; she'd have done better to seek the fountain of youth than the waters of Bath.    *****Update: I ordered the DVD from Amazon yesterday at lunch and chose free shipping and was delighted to have it in my possession before lunch today. Great service, Amazon and UPS! I was especially thrilled to see the unusual DVD case, which looks like a small hardcover book when it sits on a shelf and which feels much like a book when you hold it in your hand. The case is thicker than a regular DVD case, so I first thought that it might contain 2 DVDs. I wasn't all that disappointed when I found out that it contained just the one disc because the packaging is so spectacular. It is obvious that the people at the BBC believe that we'll want to keep this DVD for many years, so they gave us a durable and beautiful package.*****
B000A2UBN4|5.0|Sam Bowden is a womanizing lawyer who has cheated on his burnt out, bitter wife Leigh Bowden. Sam, Leigh, and their 15 year old daughter Danielle have moved to a backwater Florida town for a new start, but Sam is already showing signs of fooling around with his clerk, 16 year old Lori Davis. Meanwhile, Leigh broods at home, venting her bitterness on Danielle. But Sam's unfaithfulness becomes the least of Leigh's worries. Years ago, as a public defender, Sam had a client named Max Cady, who was accused of brutalizing a teenage girl. Sam put up a lousy defense for Max after discovering that Max was guilty of brutalizing the girl. Now, 14 years later, Cady has been released from prison and he's hungry for revenge on Sam, having spent his sentence making himself well-read in philosophy and literature. Cady's plan is to destroy Sam's career and family. This brutal, violent and suspenseful thriller combines a scorching performance by Robert De Niro. The cameo appearances by Robert Mithcum and Gregory Peck is brilliant. The fact that they played such opposite roles in the original movie was an interesting twist. If you like horror movies and thrillers, you will most likely enjoy this. This movie is definitely a keeper.

1423101472|3.0|Hailed as the second coming of Harry Potter, demigod Percy Jackson and his gang of Greek myth sidekicks has now splashed onto the silver screen. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I have read all five books of the series, including the final one, The Last Olympian.<br /><br />Like the profitable Potter series, each book features an adolescent hero battling the forces of evil with magic. Numerous battle scenes, a splash of romance, hair-raising scrapes with monsters, prophecies, clueless adults as well as adults who seem to get it--these are the market-tested elements found in both series.<br /><br />Percy Jackson seems aimed at slightly younger audience than Potter, and is also not quite as long and involved. Author Rick Riordan employs breezy American dialog and cultural landmarks, and his scenes are less dense and complex than Rowling's. By and large, the prose is snappier and flows better--Riordan was a published mystery writer before taking up Percy, and it shows.<br /><br />Up until The Last Olympian, that is. Alas, Riordan falls under the WOW (World of Warcraft) syndrome--where a battle scene gets stretched out for page after page, with made-for-CGI monster after monster getting dusted (literally) to the point of boredom. The problem, from my point of view, is that after too many impossible escapes, protected by his Achilles-like invulnerability granted by a dip in the River Styx, Percy's actions get repetitive. Yawn.<br /><br />There's killing and mayhem, but it all seems so sanitized: war as an adventure park, not a bloody mess. Thus instead of bleeding, monsters simply disintegrate. This is done to placate the parents of younger children, but it detracts from the story. Another example of this is when a bunch of satyrs show up in Manhattan, and in order to get psyched up for battle they drink root beer. Please.<br /><br />Riordan does gets high marks for appealing sidekicks Grover the Satyr and Tyson the Cyclops, as well as an off-again, on-again romance between Percy, son of Poseidon, and Annabeth, daughter of Athena. He is quite clever at using various elements of Greek mythology throughout, although I notice that the chthonic gods Dionysus, Demeter, and Persephone are vastly toned down and, in the case of Demeter and Persephone in particular, flat as cardboard. I suppose the darker elements of Greek myths--and there are plenty--need to be tamed for younger readers, but it leaves an unappealing taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Another other thing that bugs me about the series is the American hubris factor. The idea that the Greek gods decided to abandon Greece (and, apparently, other countries as well) for the cultural wellsprings of the U.S. strikes me as preposterous. I'm convinced that he put Olympus, the seat of their power, over Manhattan as a selling point to the New York publishing industry. Whereas the evil Titans based their headquarters on Mount Tam near SF. Come on, Rick, you can do better than that! (Spoken as a Bay Area resident, here.)<br /><br />Oh, and then there's the ridiculous notion that a summer camp of teenagers is capable of holding off the forces of evil and saving the world--it's like, instead of bombing Pearl Harbor, the Japanese bombed a high school in Hawaii. While Percy and the other heroes battle the bad guys, the gods conveniently abandon Manhattan to the teens in order to merely slow down a humongous monster halfway across the country disguised as series of superstorms. Meanwhile, the muggles have no clue why New York is totally trashed.<br /><br />Muggles? Drat. I meant mortals.<br /><br />Finally, since this is the last book in the series, how successfully does Riordan tie up the loose plot ends? Mixed marks here. The love triangle between Percy, Annabath, and a mortal with special powers named Rachel Elizabeth Dare gets resolved nicely. The crux of the story--how the evil Titan Lord Kronos is defeated--is a bit trickier. It all has to do with a Big Prophecy and how Luke, a former camper and son of Hermes, became possessed by Kronos. It gets a bit philosophical near the end, kind of a nice contrast to the oodles of monster dust all over Manhattan. I was a little confused and I'm not sure I buy it all, but I did care about the main characters at the end, so Riordan must have done something right.<br /><br />At the end of the book he refers to this as the \\"first\\" Percy Jackson series, and the author says he's working on a new one. I probably won't read it, unless he leaves the root beer and monster dust behind.ical near the end, kind of a nice contrast to the oodles of monster dust all over Manhattan.

0783116934|4.0|Very good movie.  I caught about half of it on broadcast and was so interested that I bought the movie.  Reading about the actual case on Wikiepedia and watching the movie (five times), the actors brought to life not only the persuit of the criminal, but the average lives of Soviet citizens during the 1980s and early 1990s.  My only complaint is that real life does not imitate the movie.  The bad guy was shot in the head very shortly after being found guilty.  No long appeal process in Russia!!
0321544080|4.0|This is a wonderful book for photographers--well written and totally entertaining. Joe McNally apparently carried around a studio suite of lighting equipment and cameras, and put all that stuff to good use in various locations outside of studios. The proof is in the pictures, and McNally shows each image and tells how it was made. It's fascinating stuff. But for most of us, it's way beyond budget. Perhaps studio photographers can benefit from McNally's tips on gels, reflectors and multiple strobes. But for those who shoot on the street, at events or while hiking the landscape, these equipment-laden methods do not apply. That's not to say there's nothing for the less endowed photographer to learn here. It's just one might expect to find here less extravagant solutions to common problems.

B002QW7ALM|2.0|This is one of those movies that instead of just showing you a scene they mess with the frame, do shotty takes and use unnecessary loud noise...in and attempt...to either scare you, makes something interesting...that allot of times isn't, be clever or just flat out try to be a trendy film maker.  Ever see \\"Choke\\", same thing....or \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\", same film style...a sad hack job labeled as \\"artistic\\" but really just lame.  It comes off moreless annoying, this entire movie I kept wishing the camera would back up, focus, or stop shaking all the time enough to just let me see something as simple as two people talking.  Its ridiculous.  The best way I can describe this movie is hearing a baby cry for an hour and a half right in your ear, have a strobe light flashing in your face and someone asking you the same question over and over again.      The sad thing is, the story as far as science fiction is concerned really isn't that bad.  But you have to really have patience to see past all that's wrong with this movie.  Another film maker could have used this story to make a better movie.  This film kind of treads on the whole \\"Event Horizon\\" type thing, but that movie which wasn't all that great either was way better than this.  Same theme where everyone is confused all the time and asking the same question over and over and over again, communicating in such a broken sense that its a wonder how they even fuction in normal life.  They seem to know absolutely nothing, or have any ability to ask a basic question or give a basic answer without some cryptic ramble...showcased in a elder's relevation tale of the ships purpose.  This movie at least has a hot chick, whom of course has a massive boob job with mad cleavage popping out.  As much as this made it better for me because I am a dude, it was pointless for the movie.  Speaking of point...the movie in a whole can be summed up in four sentences.  People wake up, ship is infested with morphing breeding orgy creatures that eat people.  Ship captain is insane, keeps people there to feed rangouls to play god in sense, talks to himself constantly.  Ship was sent to earth like planet to inhabit the future of humanity, but is currently underwater.  Boy and boob girl escape and float to surface, cleavage still intact.    I can't say pass on this, just don't throw money away by buying it.  Rent it first or buy from a discounted seller.      ***On thing I never understood about movies taking place hundreds of years form now***    Do we talk like old englishman?  Or even like Pilgrams?  Or even like people did back in the 30's?  Why in these movies do people use modern day language or culture ladid profanity.  Even though the \\"F\\" bomb may be popular and used these days, I doubt it will be still as frequently used 400 year from now.  Doesn't make sense
B002A4Q652|5.0|April Rain is Delain's second album.   The Delain project was originally started as side project for keyboard player and composer Martijn Westerholt.  Their first effort was well recieved enough that it created a following, allowing him and Charlotte Wessels to create April Rain.    I liked their first record quite a bit.  It didn't have the sharp edges that much of current Dutch \\"gothic\\" metal usually has, but it had a sweetness and musicality that I enjoyed.      Enter April Rain...  NOW we're talking about progress.   This is a fantastic record in all respects, from writing to playing to production values.   Its important to note, that if you like those silly B&B growl bands, then Delain's minimal to non existent use of this gimmicky filler might disappoint you.   There is vibrant melodious music here, clearly sourced from the keyboards of Mr Westerholt, and embellished by his friends on many other instruments.    Ms Wessels voice has firmed up, and her control and expression has become nothing short of astonishing.   For someone so young, her vocal prowess is quite remarkable.  You need only watch the April Rain video on youtube to how far she has developed as a vocalist.    People like to classify and compare everything these days, but I'd rather assume most musicians would rather be viewed on their own, and indeed Delain has developed their own unique style on April Rain.   It is grounded in the foundational keyboards, surrounded by guitars and drums, and led by Ms Wessels remarkably expressive voice.    This young band has certainly came out of nowhere to become quite popular in their native Netherlands.  Its worth it to explore these music makers, just simply not to miss Charlotte Wessels vocals.    The genre of \\"gothic metal\\" has become polluted with all sorts of noisy and screeching followers, which Delain might have been with their first record.  But April Rain just explodes with maturity and progress.  Give it a try

0307266303|3.0|If you are not interested in distance running you will have no interest in this book that revolves around the passion for distance running for some members of an obscure Indian tribe in Mexico.  If you are into the Ultra Marathoning scene you will absolutely love this book and it is a must read but if you are a runner who is not very interested in the Ultra scene, this book will be mostly a curiosity but it does propose some interesting theories on trying to stay healthy during your distance training.  This part of the book allows me to give it an overall slightly positive recommendation.      The book bounces all over the place leaving the reader wondering if everything will ever be tied together causing non-ultra runners' interest to frequently wane during the book.  The author also heavy handedly interjects his obvious leftist political philosophy throughout the book and one wonders if his description of the Tarahumara Indians lifestyle is being molded to fit into the author's John Lennon \\"Imagine\\" ideals.  Older runners who admired the \\"tune out, drop out and turn on\\" phenomenon of the late `60s from a distance (otherwise they would now be ruined, homeless or dead) will get a nostalgic and escapist thrill from the leftist viewpoint of the book.    The author Christopher McDougall is a Baby Boomer jogger from Pennsylvania who writes general endurance training articles for Men's Health Magazine and whose goal is to try to overcome his frequent injuries to be able to train to complete an Ultra Marathon, which is defined as a race longer than the traditional 26.2 mile marathon distance.  This book documents his journey, with endless tangents, and the centerpiece of his journey revolves around the Tarahumara Ultra runners and an American hippie dropout who lives in their midst and organizes an Ultra race which is the climax of the book.    The author investigates the Tarahumara of the Copper Canyon area of Mexico to find the secrets of this \\"hidden tribe of super athletes.\\"  The author paints a picture of 1967 Summer of Love idealism being practiced by this \\"running tribe\\" that immediately causes the skeptical reader to wonder how much is fact and how much is fiction/folklore/mythology and how much of the author's leftist idealistic views are transposed into the description of the tribe.  He says they live communally and \\"share everything\\" without the problems of envy, cheating, sloth and stealing.  They practice free sex with wild drunken sex and beer orgies without the problems of jealousy, violence, venereal disease, neglected children and rapes.  They seem to have \\"permanent happiness\\" a condition that has eluded the rest of mankind throughout eternity.  When children play games there are no winners and losers in this egalitarian paradise, it is just entertainment.  The adults race to be together not to beat each other.  They are of course vegetarians.  They are of course, egalitarian with zero division of labor between the sexes with men walking around with babies in backpacks like John Lennon did in Central Park with Julian shortly before he abandoned him.  They are free of countries, borders and property lines and war except when encroached upon by outsiders, they are free of currency, free of religion, free of capitalism especially Nike and free of \\"carbon consumption\\".  They have no money \\"but no one is poor\\" (unlike America where the tens of millions of poor people \\"below the official poverty line\\" have multiple TVs, cars, DVD players, cell phones, air conditioning, free education, free access to emergency rooms and access to so much food a large percentage of them are obese).  Never mind the contradictions such as the fact the Indians eat rats so they are not actually vegetarians and they \\"hunt\\" and chase down deer but it never says what they do to them when they catch them, ostensibly because it might involve violence.  If you want a blueprint of how the Tarahumara live according to McDougal simply read the lyrics of Imagine.  Of course, Lennon himself was a total hypocrite living in the lap of massive material luxury acquired through his use of the capitalistic system and he wrote the song while frolicking on his million dollar yacht cruising off the coast of Bermuda on permanent vacation, but like the book constantly does, I digress.  We also discover there are corrupted Tarahumara Indians called the Urique who were corrupted by \\"Catholic Missionaries\\" who gave them Nike running shoes and shorts and live in areas with paved roads and to no surprise are later discovered to be all cheaters.    There are many obvious questions left unanswered that makes the reader even more skeptical with such basic questions as how many of these Indians are there?  After reading 300 pages about them you have no idea if there are 10 of them, 100 of them or 10000 of them.  What percentage are corrupted, 1% or 50% or 99%, we have no idea after reading the book.  The author implies that they all run and run great distances in 100 plus degree weather up and down massive and rugged mountain ranges and their lives revolve around running but this defies believability.  Is it really just a tradition that a small number of them practice?  Do they farm or do they simply gather?  Do they actually receive some government assistance, i.e. are they on welfare?  Do most of the Tarahumara actually only run when they absolutely have to like every culture that ever occupied the earth?    The Indians are said to run miraculous distances and even for days.  They have ultra marathon races on whims with no advance planning.  They are completely injury free.  They run in skirts and despite running on hard rock a lot of the time, run in sandals.  The folklore says they even had a 95 year old who ran ultra marathons according to the classic quote \\"because no one told him he couldn't do it.\\"  The NY Times previously wrote a piece on them describing them as \\"the best distance runners in the world\\".      Living among theIndians, or more accurately on their periphery is an aging American hippie dropout with leathery sunburned skin and more names than anyone and he is trying to emulate the lifestyle of the uncorrupted version of the Indians.  He is known as Mike Hickman, Micah True, White Horse, Invisible and various Spanish versions including Caballo Blanco.  The Indians refer to outsiders as \\"Bearded Devils\\".  As you probably know a common trait among pure blooded Indians is the dearth of body hair.  However they seem to at least tolerate him if not respect him.  A former low level journeyman semi-pro boxer he dropped out of society after his girlfriend left him for another man and he discovered his true passion was running ultra distances and once ran a 50 mile race in just over 6 hours.  He wound up going to the Copper Canyons of Mexico to be near the Tarahumara and to live off the land.  Depressingly the loner says he simply plans to lie down and die when he is aged and can't run anymore.  As always we later find out he isn't truly living off the land and goes back to Colorado whenever he runs out of money and works as a furniture mover then goes back to Mexico.  Hickman and McDougal meet in Mexico and a plan is hatched to stage an ultra marathon on the Tarahumara's turf that also features some outsider American ultra marathoners.     The book then digresses and answers the primary question a competitive distance runner wants to know, which is simply how good they actually are at running.  After finding out the answer, this is where the competitive distance runner who considers ultras a fringe curiosity rather than truly a part of the ferociously competitive landscape of elite distance running, begins to lose interest in the book and goes into hang on mode for the rest of the book.  In the early to mid `90s, a promoter, who is cast as so unscrupulous to the point of being a cartoon caricature by the author, brought a few Tarahumara to Colorado several years in a row to compete in the Leadville 100 mile ultra race.  How did the Indians fare?  Well, the centerpiece of these races features a battle between the Tarahumara men and a female ultra runner named Ann Trason who has a marathon personal best of 2:40.  One of the men barely was able to beat Trason at the end of the race.  To the author this was proof of just how good they are, but to a knowledgeable fan of elite competitive distance running, it is proof that they are not all that good.  It is simply a matter of taste.  I have nothing against ultras and I think it is great they have the freedom to do what they do and I even respect what they do.  The very best distance runners in the world don't bother to compete in ultras and would instantly dominate the sport if they chose to do so.  So the Tarahumara at Leadville were up not up against truly elite runners and in fact only one of them just barely beat a female ultra who inherently was not as good as the best male ultras.  Legendary distance coach Joe Vigil is quoted in the book as saying \\"no elite coach of distance runners gives a hoot about ultras.\\"    In yet another tangent, Vigil paradoxically gets interested in the Tarahumara to expand his knowledge of coaching and like any good coach to see if he could learn something new.  According to the author, Vigil learned that the Tarahumara seem to love their running more than any other group and that can be one of the key ingredients to ultimate success in competitive distance running.    The next tangent in the book is the most valuable part of the book and why I recommend the book, if just barely.  The author does an in depth examination of the theory of footwear minimalism, which is the theory that humans were designed to run barefoot and that running shoes or at least any shoes above the bare minimum cause injury.  I personally developed this viewpoint on my own in the early 1980s when it appeared to me that shoes were getting more bells and whistles and more and more expensive and that you didn't need to pay the extra price.  The author provides extensive anecdotal evidence and scientific studies to advance his theory and the reader should seriously ponder this theory.  He says the hippie Mike Hickman ditched his running shoes for sandals and his injury woes disappeared.  Another bizarre character who goes by the moniker Barefoot Ted runs thousands of miles a year barefoot.  He does cover his feet with a thin rubber glove like material called Five Finger Deck Shoes used by sailboat enthusiasts to minimize cuts.  This is an interesting thing because it is the risk of cuts that generally precludes serious barefoot training.      The author says that problem with running shoes is that they allow you to run with unnaturally poor form which eventually leads to overuse injuries.  If you run barefoot on grass you will run differently than with shoes, and that different way is actually the true natural way your feet were designed to run.  Therefore the more bells and whistles (and expensive) a shoe gets, the worse it is and the more injuries it will cause.  He quotes Arthur Lydiard as saying achilles injuries were non-existent until modern shoes came out.  He says Vin Lananna has his athletes run barefoot one day a week to avoid injury.  He quotes a Swiss study of over 4000 runners that concluded the following generally accepted causes of injury actually did not cause any injuries including - lack of stretching, running on hard surfaces, being too heavy, going too fast, injury history, etc.  The only direct link to injury was this:  The more expensive the shoe, the more likely you are to be injured.  I found this interesting because I personally wear a 35 dollar pair of Saucony Cohesion shoes with zero frills.  He quotes a University of Hawaii study that has similar conclusions and in fact says the more you stretch, the more likely you are to get injured.  Another study concludes that 65-80% of all distance runners are forced to take time off from running due to injury every year and again over designed shoes are the culprit.     The author and quoted studies say the more cushioning the shoe has and the softer the surfaces you run on causes the runner to unconsciously to push down harder in search of stability causing heavier joint impact and possible injury.  According to the author if you are wearing a heavily cushioned expensive shoe and running on a soft trail you will have much higher impact forces on your joints than someone running barefoot on a paved surface because the later is running lightly and naturally.  He goes on to say that worn shoes are safer than new shoes.  I would agree with that with one caveat, that is if wear is in one spot you can have a serious imbalance leading to achilles problems.    The author then goes off on the obligatory anti-Nike rant.  What leftist worth his salt is going to neglect attacking Nike?   He attacks Bill Bowerman legendary Oregon Coach and Nike co-founder with the claim that he never actually ran which I must presume is true.  I assumed Bowerman ran for legendary Oregon coach Bill Haywood, the first of the 3 Bills.  He says Lydiard invented jogging when he created the Lydiard Auckland joggers club which is detailed in Lydard's own books that consisted of old men, many of whom were heart attack victims, who reinvigorated their lives through jogging.  McDougall says Bowerman stole this idea and wrote his best selling \\"Jogging\\" book.  He goes on to imply that Nike products hurt people and the company knows/knew that and continued to do it anyway.  Lefties will eat up \\"the evil big corporation\\" tangent of the book.  To me Nike is just another corporation (with 60% of working adults owning a stake in it whether they know it or not), that is neither a good nor evil entity whose mission is to maximize profits by selling products that people want at a price people are willing to pay.  I think it is great that they have that freedom and that consumers have the freedom to buy or not buy their products.  I personally have decided that Nike's products are inferior and overpriced so I choose to not buy them.  Ironically, we find late in the book that author \\"has to\\" wear Nikes for the climatic race.    From here the author strays off into very shaky ground in an attempt to sell the title of the book \\"Born to Run.\\"  The theory is that humans are designed and naturally evolved to be running great distances daily.  He enlists a little known anthropologist named Dr. Bramble.  Since one of my personal hobbies is anthropology and the evolution of man, I expected to find this part of the book very interesting.  Unfortunately, I found this whole section to be a classic case of \\"Postmodern Science\\" and far removed from Enlightenism and rational based scientific discovery.  All too often Post Modernists will take a political cause or activist social agenda and create a so called scientific theory to forward their cause using selective cherry picked science and data, hyperbole or scare tactics, data out of context and as we are now seeing with the scandal in England and NASA- outright lies and falsification of data, to advance their political cause.      I found many long reaches, incorrect and contradictory pieces of \\"evidence\\" in this section of the book.  For instance he tries to advance the theory that our Homo Sapiens cousins the Neanderthal were smarter than us because they had equal or possibly larger brain size.  Any biologist will point out that the way a brain functions is more important than sheer size and any anthropologist will point out that the most striking aspect of Neanderthal existence was their total lack of scientific or cultural progress over the 300,000 years of their existence and they obviously lacked the critical thinking ability of homo sapiens which strongly contributed to their demise.  The doctor talks of Neanderthal's lack of a division of labor among the sexes as a positive for them, but any anthropological paper will point out the division of labor among the sexes was a major contributing factor that allowed homo sapiens to make great advances.  He also contradicts himself saying correctly that hominid's brains greatly advanced in size and ability when they got access to meat, but then goes on to say that vegetarianism is a superior and \\"natural\\".      Furthermore the doctor concludes that a 64 year old is just as physically capable as a man in his prime, provided he continues to work out.  Us students of sport know this is completely untrue.  We know that after age 35 and certainly by age 40 a rapid decline begins even if great effort is put forth to stem the decline.  In fact, based on analysis of records, a 40 year old is about as capable of a 16 year old, but far below the prime 20s and early 30s.  The doctor goes on to push the completely discredited theory that women can be equal to men in physical feats.  The best man is always far superior to the best women and average man is far superior to the average women in physical feats.  It did not take prehistoric man long to figure this out and hence the division of labor with men hunting and women gathering.  He also adds a egalitarian reach that humans are \\"more feminine\\" than other animals based on a smaller difference in size between the sexes than in some other species.      He talks about the ancient practice of running animals to exhaustion as a means of hunting.  While that probably took place in some eras in some places, although the doctor himself says there can be no hard evidence to back it up, the ever ingenious man quickly discovered it was easier to scavenge, break open bones to eat marrow that other predators couldn't get to and later to kill prey by traps, trickery, spears, blunt objects and after 30,000 BC, the bow and arrow.  In the obscure instances that man ran prey to exhaustive death, it was not because man was \\"born to run\\" it was because that is all some people in some places knew at that time.      The doctor goes on to say running is a key part of what humans are.  If you do even a casual study of anthropology, you will quickly find this to be not true.  Humans are primarily characterized by physical weakness in comparison to the animal kingdom.  Like all bipeds we are very slow runners compared to quadrupeds, we are very weak for our size, we have poor eyesight, poor sense of smell, poor hearing, a weak protective skull compared to similar sized animals and an extremely fragile outer layer of skin with no fur that is easily cut, easily damaged by sun and cold and our young take an extraordinarily long time to reach self-sustaining maturity.      According to anthropologists 3 traits allowed man to establish dominion over the world, with the first 2 far more important than the third.  The obvious is the vastly superior brain.  Combined with the power of the brain is the unique hands that have vastly superior dexterity that allow the brain's ideas to be turned into reality.  All other primates lack this dexterity.  Their palms are long and their thumbs are short which gives them superior grip strength for climbing but precludes any significant dexterity.  The final trait is human endurance, aided by the ability to sweat, which is superior to all land animals save the horse.  This endurance allowed humans to not run long distances (although they certainly can) to which there is little short term benefit, but to work hard for most of the day and in emergencies work 24 hours or more if necessary while most animals, especially other predators, must spend most of the day resting and sleeping.  Humans are born to create, build, work, control, harvest, conquer and about 100 other things before they were \\"Born to Run\\".  Of course, I do keep in mind he is trying to sell a book, just as Nike is trying to sell their products.    Finally comes the climactic race in the Copper Cannons featuring the Tarahumara, the corrupted Urique Tarahumara, Scott Jurak - who is describedby the author as the best Ultra runner in the world at the time of this race, the aforementioned Barefoot Ted, two young hard partying Virginia beach bum free spirited college dropout lovers whom the author says are elite Ultra runners, Hickman and the author.  Interestingly, the uncorrupted Tarahumara eat a pre-race meal full of meat despite their description as vegetarians.  The race is supposedly 50 miles up and down jungle/mountain trails in intense heat although there is no realistic way Hickman could have actually measured the course.  The Urique Tarahumara, who were corrupted by Catholic Missionaries and wear Nike shoes and shorts and run on paved roads, bolt to the lead and despite being way ahead of the field and race director Hickman, it is somehow obvious to Hickman that they have cheated by cutting the course and are disqualified.  I won't give away the rest of the race, but the end result has a feel of a staged ending but I don't know for sure.    Overall, I moderately recommend the book for its exploration of the Indian Tribe and the Ultra Scene in general and for the examination of the concept of running shoe minimalism.

B0021L8UQ2|4.0|I was suprised at just how good a horror movie this really was because most horror movies are not even average when compared with ordinary movies . I found that this movie was not only original but that it was also very entertaining . If I had to rate this movie on just a horror scale I would give it a 9 out of 10 .
0767817478|2.0|Okay, anyone who knows me, knows that I hate when Hollywood decides to remake anything Asian, it just never works out, the Grudge, Pulse, Godzilla, Dragonball, all failed miserably at their jobs. In it's own right this would have been an okay movie, nothing great really, but it would have been fine to plop down on the couch with some popcorn to kill some time.    The CG was okay, I'm not really that fond of CG to be honest, I'll always prefer real movie magic, stuntmen jumping out of real windows, blowing up scale, or better yet full size buildings, cars being launched through the air, animatronic monsters, these are things you just can't top with CG, there's no explosion that looks more realistic than an actual explosion.    The acting is decent I suppose, this is a monster movie though, it's not the humans you want to see, it's the giant monsters, similar to how when I pay to see a movie called Transformers I want to see giant, badass, transforming robots beating the crap out of each other, not the stupid monkeys, this is a concept that Michael Bay could stand to learn.    As I said, in it's own right this could have been decent popcorn fair, but the problem is they called it Godzilla, and this is not a real Godzilla movie. All they did was make a monster movie and tack the name Godzilla onto it for the marquee value, something which Hollywood really needs to learn always backfires. Let's analyze this, does the monster look like Godzilla? No, I didn't expect it to look exactly like the classic Godzilla, and I expected it to be mostly CG, if not all CG, which I would have been fine with, but there's a point where you go past being a redesign and just being something entirely different. Could you imagine a Superman movie where he was a black teenager wearing baggy jeans and a pink leather jacket without even having the Superman logo anywhere in sight? You wouldn't say \\"Well it's okay because it's a reimagining.\\" no, you'd say \\"This isn't Superman!\\" Does the monsteract like Godzilla? No, Godzilla doesn't climb buildings, Godzilla destroys buildings, Godzilla breaths radioactive fire, frequently, I can only remember one scene in the entire movie where the monster breathed fire at all, Godzilla can not be taken down by jets with missiles, EVER. There are precisely two things that stand a chance against Godzilla, a ridiculously absurd weapon like a device that removes the oxygen from the water, or another giant monster. You could argue that they wanted to go for a more \\"realistic\\" approach to Godzilla, but come on, that's like saying you want to take a more realistic approach to Harry Potter. Giant monster movies aren't supposed to be realistic, you've got a giant monster mutated by nuclear bombs, any sense of realism flew out the window as soon as it showed up and started wrecking the place. Even Toho, the makers of the real Godzilla movies have officially declared the monster in this movie is not, in fact, Godzilla but instead a completely different giant reptile that the Americans mistook for Godzilla, the official name is actually Zilla. Why? Because Hollywood took the God out of Godzilla by making it so incredibly weak. Don't waste your money here unless you can get a copy for under $5. You want a good monster movie? Go buy Godzilla Final Wars instead. You get tons of giant monsters, Rodan, Mothra, Gigan, Godzilla, even Zilla from this movie makes an appearance and attempts to take on the real Godzilla, this fight is easily Zilla's crowning moment of awesome.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I don't like this album, it doesn't mean I hate either.   Listening to it so far just isn't worth my time.  The 1970 released \\"Re-produced\\" by Phil Spector, for me, is kind of listening to a hybrid of the Beach Boy albums \\"Party\\" and \\"Smiley Smile\\" These all albums filled with small joys but owe their respective release to contract obligations. None of them are major artistic statements.    As I remember it, the original issue of \\"Let It Be\\" was mixed and sequenced at least twice before it was handed over to Spector to salvage what an expensive project, particularly as it was near nil that they would ever get The Beatles together in the studio since thay couldn't agree together and didn't as a unit appear for the shot of the promotional clip for \\"Something\\".  If they could of gotten another studio album, the original album probably would sat on the shelf even longer.    The Spector assemblage of songs and studio chatter at least gave you the feeling they were enjoying themselves in a hanging out with friends sort of way. The McCartney album comes across as an uninspired recital, rather less congenial or warm, but Paul got control over the released product.  Get Back/Let It Be was Paul's baby and he had been denied involvement or approval over the 1970 released album as they simply weren't talking to Paul because of business problems.    Incidential, about the roof top concert owes it existence to the fact that The Jefferson Airplane had done one some months earlier in NYC for a movie that never got finished.  The Airplane, Beatle and U2 concerts all were ended by the appearance of the Police.
0812550757|5.0|The second book in the Ender series, Speaker for the Dead is, quite simply, incredible. It's different from Ender's Game in a number of ways, both in characterization and writing style. The changes feel natural, though, as Ender is now an adult. As such, his perspective has changed, his voice has matured, and this is reflected well in the narration.<br /><br />I don't want to give even the slightest hint of a spoiler here. Suffice it to say that this is not a carbon copy of Ender's Game. It's a fully realized story that packs a punch all its own, with great characters and fascinating twists. For science-fiction fans, this novel is an absolute must-read. I'd rank it with the Dune novels, the Red Mars trilogy, and the works of Harlan Ellison as the best I've ever read.<br /><br />(Note: For the best price, go with the 4-book box set that includes Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind.)
B00000637V|5.0|Berlin is often described by listeners as \\"one of the most depressing albums of all time.\\"  This cannot be too far off from Lou Reed's original intention when crafting it.  I have heard a lot of records in my day and never have I come across a record that was so nakedly despairing and hopeless in both lyrical content and delivery.  In spite of all this, Berlin aches with a beauty on a level that few records have ever achieved, and Lou Reed had certainly not achieved in his previous solo work or work with the Velvet Underground.  The album's reviews have always been a mixed bag of deep admiration and flat out dismissal which is quite understandable, given that the subject matter is indeed stark and emotionally demanding of many listeners.  However, for those who don't mind a set of minimalist pop/rock songs overwhelmed by sadness, Berlin is a true benchmark in an obviously stunning career.<br /><br />Berlin begins with its title track, one of its strongest songs and vital in setting the mood for what follows.  Reed's whispered vocals and resigned tone here is accompanied by only a piano, creating a sparse and pensive atmosphere.  Anger and bitterness at the injustice of the world inevitably take hold in \\"Men of Good Fortune,\\" another top-notch tune that has Reed reflecting on the harsh disparity between a wealthy few and an impoverished many.  \\"Caroline Says I\\" surprises by being a brief respite from the bleakness and Berlin's only true rocker.  Reed revisits the Velvet Underground rarity \\"Stephanie Says\\" with \\"Caroline Says II\\", slowing down the original and instilling it with the somber mood so characteristic of the rest of the album.  \\"The Kids\\", Berlin's best song, tells the story of a mother who ends up losing her children for being, among other things, a \\"miserable rotten slut.\\"  An already painful listen, it fittingly ends with children crying out for their mother.  \\"Sad song\\" makes for an excellent and majestic closer, complete with gorgeous strings and gospel choir as Reed wryly mutters that \\"somebody else would have broken both her arms.\\"<br /><br />As the album sharply concludes, you really realize that this stuff is not at all for the faint of heart.  However, if you're inviting of the emotions that Reed intends to crush you with, you will find that it is truly a unique and breathtaking listen.

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is a remarkably simple straight forward told story about a hard and rough man living in a remote village in Africa.  The story begins years before missionaries enter the landscape and begin to change the culture and customs of the land.  The novel tells us of life before and after the missionaries came.    Although the novel is mostly about rituals, beliefs and history around this important period in Africa, it chooses to follow a very strong and unlikable character as its main focus.  His name is Okonkwo.  He came from a lazy father who he hated and is spite of that laziness and hatred of his father, Okonkwo becomes a hard working and ambitious leader in the clan of his village.    Okonkwo is not a good man.  He beats his wife and kids regularly.  He is a beast with a fierce temper but he is also a very respected throughout the village.      On a night of grieving Okonkwo accidentally shoots another clan member and is cast out for seven years with his family to his mother's homeland.  Then the missionaries begin coming into the village during his absence. Okonkwo later disowns his son when he becomes friendly with the missionaries, who Okonkwo despises.    He returns back to his old village to find nothing is the same.  The white man and his religion have changed everything.  This isn't a book about flowery description and at times is very skeletal in its description but it moves along briskly with its story.  There is never any emotional attachment that we develop with any of these characters.  The characters seem to be mere vessels to carry the ideas and themes of the novel which really is about the vast differences between cultures and the connections that can unite or divide us.    I found the novel very good because it made me think about these ideas.  At times I wondered how anyone could believe such things and there are some odd cultural practices, but then I realized that these people might also think my beliefs just as strange as theirs.The book is simple and interesting.    It is no masterpiece though.  I believe the main problem with the book lies with the main character Okonkwo himself.  I felt no pity in his demise even if some understanding remained for his firm beliefs and his fight to hold on to what he felt sacred.    Even with great ideas and cultural beliefs, I can't think a book is great unless I feel some connection to the characters and with Things Fall Apart I just couldn't.  I just couldn't stand Okonkwo.    Don't get me wrong, I still highly recommend the book for the interesting ideas that one can dissect and discuss.  I felt it would have had a stronger main character it could have been much stronger and might even have lifted it to a level of greatness.     Grade : B+
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I'm really disapointed about my 405CX and with the support provided by the company...In last September I bought my Forerunner 405CX in Amazon, two months later the wrist strap broke by itself. Also the HR monitor sometimes fail while I'm running. I tried to contact the Support once, but my e-mail was not answered. I was expecting much more of this equipment and of Garmin company itself...
B00110K62U|4.0|I could not give higher marks to the 10th Anniversary production of this great old show.  I gave it only 4 Stars out of 5 for weaknesses in the DVD, released in 2008, for reasons that I shall describe later.  The production design and lighting were awe inspiring and the musical forces brought to bear by the London Symphony Orchestra and a huge chorus were worthy of a performance of a Mahler Symphony.    Colm Wilkinson, as Valjean, was brilliant.  Although already 51 at the time this performance was filmed he was nevertheless wonderful, particularly during the difficult high pitched mezza voce passages of his solos.  Others were equal to Wilkinson, though.  Alun Armstrong, as the crooked innkeeper, was a comic wonder, as was Jenny Galloway as his equally funny wife.  I also loved  the young and beautiful Ruthie Henshall, as Fantine.  She has a gorgeous mezzo voice, which she used to perfection here.  Also noteworthy were the also young and beautiful Lea Salonga, as  Eponine, Michael Ball, as Marius, and Judy Kuhn, as Colette.  All had both the musical and dramatic skill to to showcase this classic musical theater piece.    Now comes the hard part.  Despite this performance having, apparently, been filmed in widescreen format, the disc's producers, for reasons I simply cannot understand, failed to give us a Blu-ray version although, by the time this disc was released in 2008,  Blu-ray was starting to take hold.  Equally disappointing was the two channel soundtrack.  This classic performance of a classic show warranted a remixing of the soundtrack to 5.1 channels.  Had the show been less outstanding than it was, either visually or sonically, I would not have been as disappointed as I am.  As it is, though, I anguish over what a wasted opportunity it turned out to be.  In my estimation, this aspect of the disc, alas, deserves only 1 Star out of 5.  For that reason, I won't be buying it but if a Blu-ray version with a 5.1 HD audio soundtrack is ever produced I'll be first in line.
B000059H99|5.0|Quite simply the best version of Rocky 1 ever made. This version has extended scenes that you do not get with the regular Rocky. This is a must have for anyone who loves the Rocky Series. Even if you have Rocky 1 you should still get the special edition version.
0446567329|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Nickolas Sparks is brilliant writer.  The book is much better than the movie!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I didn't get a chance to hear these before I bought them. I was trusting the reviews on line and I must say I am amazed at how well these sound. I have tested the Dr.Dre phones at Best Buy and others, they didn't sell this model of Sony there(Big Mistake)! These are way better than the Dr Dre and all the Bose I have heard and at half the price in some cases. Thanks to all on this site for the great and honest reviews.<br /><br /> I love the way these were packaged and like that they came with a storage case to keep them protected against dust and elements and keeps the extra long cord from getting tangled. I know some people didn't like the long cord, but I like to have the extra freedom to move around and the cord and jacks are high quality. Good for Sony for not cutting corners and keeping these at top quality. Also not made in China!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I will briefly discuss the movies, although you must be from a third world country if you don't know about The Matrix! It is about a future time where once man was dependent on machines, they are dependent on man. The Matrix is a virtual world where humans believe they live out their lives normally, but in reality they are grown and kept to serve as power for the machines. Confusing? It gets worse! The films make you think and not just drool at the screen with the awesome fights and special effects (by far some of the greatest in modern film making). The movies have some moments where it takes itself far too seriously (especially REVOLUTIONS). All in all these are great because of interesting storytelling, mind-blowing effects and excellent casting. I would like to add that the role of Neo is perfect for Keanu's acting style (which is highlighted by his inability to convey real emotion on screen).<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: \\"WHOA!\\" That should sum it up. Amazing picture and details. I love how beautiful the green hue comes out when the scenes are set in the matrix! The sound is awesome. The extras are copius and all have been carried over! FINAL THOUGHTS: TAKE THE RED PILL AND FIND OUT JUST HOW FAR THE RABBIT HOLE GOES! UPGRADE!!!<br /><br />P.S. Carrie-Anne Moss looks so good in latex and Monica Bellucci is HOT AS HELL!
B000JIHP88|5.0|This mobile is cute and easy to assemble.  Haven't turned it on yet (note to self: get D batteries!), so I can't attest to quality or staying power.  I really like that it can convert into a music box/nightlight for later stages.  For those who are wondering about attachment, it essentially hooks onto the back of the crib and is tightened with a big plastic nut.  I was a little worried about fit as I have a sleigh-style crib, but it was not a problem, and feels plenty sturdy. Can't wait to see it in action!
0316017922|5.0|In this book, Malcolm Gladwell explains that success is not a random act. Rather, it arises out of the steady accumulation of a powerful set of circumstances, opportunities and advantages such as culture legacies, generation, as well as family and community history. He also uses poignant examples, from Bill Gates to his mother's own experience, to show how success is a function of persistence and the willingness to work hard and to try, so that one can be ready when needed most. Therefore, according to him practice is one of the secrets of success in sport, business, art and science...Boiled down:  If you want to shine, be ready to start putting in about 10.000 hours.
0099786400|5.0|I have owned and read this book numerous times in my lifetime so I already knew what I was getting.  I was replacing this book as my last copy had wandered away with a borrower, but I could not stand the thought of it not being in my library.  This book was a life change for me; one of the most profound moments in my life and I recommend it to anyone.

075640407X|5.0|This is a superbly well-written book and well worth the time spent reading it.  However the gap between books is way too long and one may forget to check for the sequel(s).  Character development shows a knack for detail and the story is compelling.  I will just have to read it again when the sequel arrives to keep the storylines straight.
0316017922|1.0|Outliers is a fun/interesting read. But it needs to be taken with a great deal of salt.........I just checked for the hell of it the birthdays of both hockey teams  Canada and US, who just finished the Vancouver Olympics.  Mr. Gladwell remarks regarding this topic is utterly false. One does NOT have to be born in Jan. or Feb. to succeed in hockey. The star Sydney Crosby was born on Aug.7th, Brooks Orpik Sept.26th, Ryan Miller July 17th, Marc Andre Fleury Nov.28th, and a famous \\" oldie \\" Mario Lemieux Oct.5th.........And the list goes on.......<br />Did Mr. Cladwell think we wouldn't check?  Leads me to believe what else is  \\" not so \\" in his fact reporting book?
B00275EGWY|3.0|\\"The Hurt Locker\\" is about Sergeant First Class William James and his explosive ordinance disposal unit's adventures in Iraq.  While James is an interesting character and there are certainly many suspenseful moments in the movie when bombs are being defused and the unit is being shot at, there is no real compelling storyline to this movie at all.  Instead, the movie watcher is taken from one stressful Iraq experience to another in a constant onslaught of tense situations.  Unfortunately, even most video games out there nowadays have just as much suspense as \\"The Hurt Locker,\\" but with better storylines.  I have absolutely no idea why this movie is considered one of the best movies of 2009, and can only attribute it to the inherent positive bias that movie critics have for any movie that has a theme of \\"War is Bad,\\" even if there is no story that goes along with it.  Still, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is a good watch on video and much better than the average action movie being made today.  However, I don't think that it's anything special.  Hopefully, someday a movie can be made that combines the tension of the Iraq War experience with a great story.  \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is just not that movie.
0316044695|1.0|I have enjoyed books about Special Forces in the past and admire the men who have made it to this level.  I was really looking forward to a good read about an admittedly amazing mission in Afghanistan.      After 50 pages my gag reflex was working at full strength.  Do you really have to mention every other sentence how big, bad, and tough you are.  I'll give this terrible author a hint that any screenwriter or decent action author knows.  People are going to be impressed by describing in detail what the heroes do and letting us supply the admiration.  You don't have to constantly tell the reader what to think.  This book is the worst example of writing down to an audience that I have read in a long time.  Another major fault is the constant repetition.  At one point within the space of 6 or 7 paragraphs the Taliban were described with almost exactly the same adjectives 3 different times.  I think the author thought he was being paid by the word.    I could go on, but the basic idea is that the book is very poorly written.  I don't know how anyone above a 4th grade reading level slogs through this mess.  I'm sure its a great story.  Maybe someone could make a movie out of it.  It would be one of the few times that the movie would have to be better than the book.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade is back..I enjoy this CD... some of the songs took a while to grow on me....
B002QY9RMA|5.0|I had never purchased anything from Beyonce but was very much surprised at her versatility and voice range.  I just love this CD
0743298039|3.0|This book was a different read, fragmented and just not my cup of tea.  I would not have chosen it except it was a book club choice.  Interesting characters, but I just didn't care for it.
B001FB4VZS|2.0|I like alot of others was originally a fan because we wanted to see Supermans back story. Other then the familar names all of us Superman fans know,you will hardly recognise this gore fest. The constant comparisons to Jesus are offensive. Clark can only save you from accidents!Jesus saves souls. (they bring it up,not me).  Gory season with rip and slash thanks to Doomsday. Nothing like the comics where doomsday fights superman to the death.    Dream secuence with clark ripped in half alone was enough for me. Impalements etc...Lana comes back again and the supposedly extremely moral Clark ends up in bed with her.. Most good shows you want to find out what happens, this show we are waiting for clark to put on the cape, to fly, to be a hero. Here he's a guy whos so passive it drives you crazy...Time to end this show..
068484267X|5.0|Great novel. Makes you realize things about your own life, while giving you a fun read.

B000RP229K|5.0|I lucked upon a copy of this book about ten years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  In fact, I have bought 6 copies for friends and family members and each person later told me how much they enjoyed it and recommended it to others. Today I bought 2 more copies.  These people ranged from those with English majors or minors (3) to those with chemistry and geology majors (2), business major (1), math major (1) electrical engineering (1) and those still in high school (4) and each person found the writing style informative and interesting. Bill Bryson is able to deliver entertainment and education in the same package with great results.
0385341008|5.0|Enjoyed this book and learned about issues during the war that affected everyone, but not really written about.
B00000JT9E|5.0|Live Intrusion has a lot of the same songs as Reign In Blood: Still Reigning but really is a keeper. Although is a VHS, the sound is really surprisingly loud. I still think they should consider making Live Intrusion a DVD with 5.1 dolby sound. Also, I hope one day Slayer will make another concert DVD with different songs.
B002VECMAE|1.0|Is there a zero rating, because this movie would be five under it.  I can't say one good thing about this movie.  It was a real disappoinment.  I love George Clooney, but this is the worst movie he has ever done.  It didn't end fast enough for me. It was long, boring, even \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" rated it as one of the worst movies of the year.  I can't agree more.  I hope this review saves all you possible future viewers from this movie.  Don't waste your money or time on it.
0786891084|2.0|I have read a couple of her other books which were very good. I was very frustrated and pushed myself through about 25-30 pages. While I was already interested in the characters, I did not like the \\"Letter\\" format. I have forced myself through a couple of other books that were in \\"Email\\" format. I just don't understand why an author would do this. It is very slow and annoying.  I really wish This book was available in the common format. I really enjoyed her other books and feel disappointed that I couldn't force myself to finish this one. My loss aparently because this book did get some good ratings.....
1400052173|5.0|After reading the prologue of this book at Amazon.com, I ordered two copies! The first was for our family (my father suffered from polio twice in his lifetime, later dying young of prostate cancer), plus I wanted our daughter to read it given her interest in medical research as a college major. The second went to my daughter's high school Honors Biology instructor, a Colon cancer survivor who is miraculously recovering now from Leukemia, including a recent stem cell transplant! All these medical conditions and their respective treatments/cures (plus so much more) can be linked to HeLa cells.     As a non-scientific freelance writer, I was amazed and impressed at the level of thorough research done for this book (check out the credits in the back!), plus the easy-to-read flow that explained the issues for lay people.    For the science crowd, here is the comment that came back from my daughter's teacher when she received the book:     \\"What a surprise you sent me! I have known about Henrietta Lacks since I first started teaching and my colleague told me about the 'Helen Lane' cells. I include it every year in our class discussion about cell division. It was only a few years ago thanks to the internet that I found out it was Henrietta Lacks and a bit of info about her.  This book is great though because it includes the whole story about her, the treatment of blacks in the 40s and 50s, the value of her cells, the process they went through to grow cells and figure out transport, the ethics of it all and the story of her family. I absolutely love it and am considering using it for my summer AP Bio reading assignment in addition to or instead of Dr. Tatiansa's Sex Advice to All Creation, another great book. Anyway I can't thank you enough; I am already on chapter 17 and should finish it this week. I love it!  Thank you!    Get this for anyone you know who is into science, medical research, bioethics, African-American history, race relations, or simply someone who enjoys agood non-fiction read! While you're at it, make a contribution to the scholarship fund for Henrietta's descendants as the author so generously suggests. We cannot change the inequities of the past, but we can - in our own small way - impact the future.
B00003CXB4|5.0|the product arrived in mint condition. I am thankful I was able to share this classic from my childhood with my 2 year old daughter.
B000FCK42M|5.0|I may never travel south of the border again.  This book presents a fictionalized history of the drug war from the 80' to today. As such it also covers the US involvement in Columbia and other South American countries. Mexico is, of course, the main player. It gave me a real sense of what is going on in the drug war and why our present course is doomed to fail.    There are several extremely violent sections. However, it all plays together with the story. Winslow's characters are very believable. The \\"bad\\" guys have good traits as the \\"good\\" guys have bad.    I have previously read Don Winslow's \\"The death and life of Bobby Z\\" and enjoyed it a lot. I'll be buying more Winslow in the future.

0061898813|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read...I could not put it down until I finished it!  Shocking ending, I never guessed it at all.  For people who like mysteries, I highly recommend this book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Always up for a new interpretation of any favorite Jane Austen novel, I was keen to try this version upon knowing of its existence, though, there is always the trepidation of , `Did they get it right?'. For me, as long as the rendition is within the spirit of the morals, mood, story and style of Austen, I can accept little variances, alterations and additions. Am I a true Janeite? I do think that I am. Was I disappointed in this one? Not at all, I assure you.  Thoroughly eager to be treated, I sat down with my pretty tea cup and saucer (filled to the brim with a warm and delicious favorite milky drink) and with my split, toasted and buttered English muffin (crumpet) on the side. I knew not entirely or precisely what I was about to experience, but with so many fine British actors I had seen before (who generally guaranteed fine performances), and the BBC period piece promise of plenty of English Country eye candy deliciousness, I was confident that I'd be highly entertained.  Yes, there was a treasure trove of teacups, crystal and china; candle holders from the interestingly rustic to glamorous candelabras; wonderful furnishings and paintings, color, décor and costuming; yummy old English and older architecture from the quaint cottage feel and village row housing, to the country manor and even the abbey or castle style. And then, of course there were the horses, always a personal must and favorite of my own. Who could object to horses? And what is more manly than a man on a horse, I ask you?  Well, after all that preamble, for my part, let me share that this version of Emma is gradually turning out to be my favorite. I watched it back-to-back several times upon receiving the DVD (not in one night, but night after night). Each time I was reaching the ending, I knew I wanted to see it from the beginning again as soon as possible. I still love the Kate Beckinsale version and quite like much of the Paltrow one, but, beyond the fact that this one is longer and thereforehas more to offer in that way, there is all the more in other ways as well.  The added back-story of when the key young people were little (and lost their mothers to death) was done wonderfully and sets the stage for our goodly understanding of many of the characters a little more than we might have done before. Michael Gambon quickly and thoroughly charmed me as Mr. Woodhouse. Who could not love that darling man, the way he loves and wants to protect his family and even friends, and to keep them always near him? Gambon's interpretation may seem too subtle to some, but, to me, it is his gentle genius showing once more. Romola Garai sparkles as a delightful Emma throughout, and she evokes plenty of laughter at her mishaps and managements. Her natural beauty is even overshadowed, in a lovely way, by her happy ease of spirit in translating this persona of Emma. This Mr. Knightly, by Johnny Lee Miller, seems to me by far to be the most likeable of any before. I can truly believe that Emma could love him in the end. Indeed, and to be sure. His disparity of age melts away to a mere trifle and then to nothing at all. The Mr. and Mrs. Elton we have here, are each excellently hilariously entertaining. Miss Bates and her mother are sympathetic figures, more than ever before. This Frank Churchill seems a perfect fit too - just the right balance for this character. Yes, this Emma has promptly turned into my own personal favorite.  Add to all that, the extra special features on the DVD were a true treat and my only complaint is that there wasn't more - much more! My added request to that is a widely and easily available soundtrack to match - the music was also wonderful!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Excellent show!!!!  Too bad the writer's strike cut the season short.  Will definitely be getting Season 2.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|saying there may be something wrong with Esther is understatement.if hell is missing one of its demons,they can call off the search.Esther isn't really a demon,but you get the idea.the main premise of the movie may not be all that original,but this movie puts its own little twist/spin on it that i thought was quite ingenious.there are a few clues that lead you toward it if you really pay attention.and for once,i actually was,and knew there something else going on,and fleetingly had the right idea of what the twist was gonna be,but then abandoned it for some reason.beyond the great twist,though,the rest of the movie is also fantastic.it moves right along,has great suspense,has some very harrowing moments.the acting was great.i love Vera Farmiga in anything she appears in.she takes a back seat here though to young Isabelle Fuhrman,who portrays Esther.if this movie is any indication she has a very bright future ahead of her.overall,one of the better made suspense/horror films i've seen in awhile. 4.7/5
031606792X|4.0|Thank you all for your reviews, especially the ones that were best rated. It was a real pleasure to read them. There are so many things I agree with and yet I couldnt rate less than 4. Why? because in almost every book you will find many flaws, things that make you cringe how actually embarrassing they are.  If I had paid to much attention to them, I am afraid I wouldn't have enjoyed so many great books.    Eventhough I understand almost every negative rap.. if we looked a little closer, we could see that she couldnt have written a much better book - not one that we all/the most us love. Some of us dislike that Bella doesnt want to marry..the other that she did marry. Some can't stand the fact that she ended up \\"caving\\" by agreeing to the marriage, the other complain because she doesnt sacrifice anything. We judge Stephenie's motivations why she wants get them married.. what names she chose and so n. Are this trivial things reasons enough to rate this book that bad? I guess some dose of disappointment and writing in affect makes it probably sound worse than it should..    Stephanie could not have done it muuuuch better..cuz we do judge by projecting our perception on it. This is not really fair... Bella did sacrifice..for example her friends or at least having a deep and honest friendship to them... while some of us blame Bella for being that stupid and weak and not caring about them, not missing them and being to fixed to the Cullens.. the others find she dint loose anything.    Those who didnt like her for agreeing to the marriage..I think they should rethink their opinions, because that actually doesnt make her weak at all. This is a relationship..its all about compromises. Edward didnt want her to become a vampire that soon... they negotiated what seemed best for both. Why not? he as a man doesnt have the right to make conditions? in order not to be a macho he has to do anything she wants? as there were not enough people accusing Edward of being too soft.    I think we should try to avoid judging a book because of things like that. I just need a plausible explanation..and yes, its plausible why Edward wants that bad to marry.. the time he \\"came from\\", time that his character were formed..it was a different one. Hasn't he the right to be himself without being marked as uptight?    btw, I would like to marry..some day, yes... but for instant, recently I read the \\"Gracling\\"...its a great book. The heroine, a very cool female, however, didn't want to marry. It seems she would rather killed herself than marry a man, not even the one she really loved. But it was not a problem for me.. on the opposite. It was that great explained that I fully understood ...and this really fit so well as an trait of her. If I would choose, I wouldn't want her to be the other way...because that wouldnt be the same authentic person.    The same thing is with renesme... I think its ok. We know Bella wasnt keen of having babies, being a wife and that stuff.. but it happend and wasnt bad. actually, thats life..not everything is predictible and some things seem not desirable, and yet they can be the best things that happend to us. The same way we should try handle books.. to try to see the reason behind, to love it as it is..eventhough not perfect, because life is not either.  Again, some could say...she didnt miss/sacrifice anything...the other ones(or sometimes even the same ones) are worried what bad model/guide Bella for the girls is..because she would sacrifice anything for Edward/the Cullen.  Either she is weak because she doesnt sacrifice anything, or she is weak because she does sacrifice everything by dedicating her life to the Cullens. As you see, there will always be someone who dislike some parts    So people, look at it from another perspective. This isnt that bad... eventhough it is not the Bella we know from Twilight (if she were, I am sure there would be someone who is disappointed because she didnt develop/mature = ) ).. she isnt that bad. Try to find the good points.. For instant, I would want Jake to love Leah..it would fit that much better..because both lost a big love and I am sure they would heal each other.. but he imprinted on renesme. But the idea behind was probably to get together two \\"enemies\\". For me not perfect, but not bad either.    What I really loved is the idea of Bella's power. Its a great emblem of how great an actually passive power can be.. a power that is not immediately obvious... its not physical/material like the one of kate or emmet, but it was more effective than the most of theirs. Its a very nice symbol.. you dont have to be able to attack , nor to have phisically strenght to be really strong....the mental power makes you that much \\"stronger\\" and prtection/defence is a skill that does not hurt anybody (just helps)... which is obviously much greater than a painful attack. And, for me, this is a good model and message to all people out there..    The cover is a wonderful choice. Eventhough the king is the most important character.. everything is devoted to him.. but the queen is the one that help you the most, that is great skilled and that you enyoj the most.      So, sorry for the long review and more sorry for my bad englisch. But summarily, Do not expect (to) much.. and try to enyoj it by granting someone the right to make different choices than you would.    Love
B001HADE00|4.0|`Out of the Cellar' was promise fulfilled by Ratt as their EP had debuted a year before. With a much slicker (professional) production and pop-friendly chorus, the album achieved monster success and is generally acclaimed as one of the iconic records from the hair metal era. LA was fast becoming seen as the epicenter of this much maligned musical movement (critically) and Ratt had paid their dues as a club band who had made the drive from San Diego (where band leader and vocalist Stephen Pearcy originally hailed from) to become the new darlings of the Sunset Strip. \\"Round and Round\\" was one THE defining anthems of the `80's and is still requested and listened to quite a bit today when much of its ilk has been relegated to the critical scrap heap (the recent film \\"The Wrestler\\" pays tribute to it). `Out of the Cellar' was a very complete album and really the most consistent record the Ratt ever put out as the law of diminishing returns and lack of real staying power eventually caught up to them. Warren DeMartini also makes his ascendency as Ratt's main man and because of band co-founder Robbin Crosby's lesser talent and notorious partying this made it easier for DeMartini to flash his considerable talents as lead guitarist. \\"Back for More\\", \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"Lack of Communication\\" and the Juan Croucier penned \\"She Wants Money\\" are all album highlights. Croucier would soon feel squeezed by Pearcy's dominance but here it was all smiles and good times. Pearcy brought my personal favorite \\"In Your Direction\\" from his San Diego Mickey Ratt days. Vey few duds here but as I said before, Ratt would never put out another record as consistently entertaining as `Out of the Cellar'
B0009A21R6|5.0|Ok the truth is that I had never even heard of SACDs until I bought an Oppo DVD player this summer. When reading the manual it mentions SACDs so I googled them and got interested. This is the first SACD I've listened to and I am completely blown away. Are all SACDs like this? I don't know yet but I'm going to get some more and find out!<br /><br />The guy who said it gives him chills to listen to it wasn't kidding. I've heard this album about a million times since it came out in 1985 but I feel like I just really HEARD it for the first time. I've always loved the album mind you - it's one of those perfect works of art, on par with Graceland etc - but the SACD is like nothing I've heard before. I highly, highly recommend this if you have an SACD player. Every detail in the mix is perfect. Wow.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews here previously for encouraging me to get this!
B0007PAMEM|5.0|This concert is \\"one\\" of her \\"Best\\" and we loved it and again, we are adding it to our collection.  She's definitely one of the most popular entertainers of our era and we're so happy to be able to watch this concert.
B002VECLVO|4.0|A Single Man is the first film by Tom Ford (yes, the fashion designed Tom Ford). It stars Colin Firth, who is rightly nominated for an Oscar and won a BAFTA for his role.<br /><br />The film is absolutely riveting. Colin Firth is phenomenal, and if I were voting for the Academy Awards, I would pick him over Jeff Bridge. Yes, I adored Crazy Heart and Jeff Bridges' performance; that's how good Colin Firth was. Colin Firth is a British English professor living in L.A. in the 1960's. His lover died recently, but he is present in flashbacks. Julianne Moore stars as Firth's best friend, who also emigrated from England. She's a delightful alcoholic with her own problems.<br /><br />As a director, Tom Ford shows immense promise, even if it felt he tried to hard visually at certain times. There were a few overly long extreme close-ups that did not add much to the scene. He was clearly trying to hard visually at some points, but for most of the film it was beautiful and interesting. As someone who rarely notices a film's score, I was mesmerized by the use of music throughout the film. The music provided extra depth. For a first film, it is fantastic. The acting alone would make this movie excellent, but it's truly a film lover's film.
6305971935|3.0|as time travel travel movies goes this one's pretty decent.i've seen a  few in my time,many of them stinkers,and this is certainly no  stinker.it isn't necessarily the best of the genre,but it works for  what it is.it's fairly low key and sedate.the special effects range  from not bad to pretty good,especially for the time period during which  the movie was made.the acting was pretty decent as well,though also low  key,like the rest of the movie.the story is decent enough.the movie  reminded me of another time travel movie from 1980 starring Kirk  Douglas called The Final Countdown,which to me is a superior movie.as  for The Philadelphia Experiment,i give it a 3/5

B001GCUER0|5.0|The series MADMEN has captured the culture, color and swaggar of the times of 1960.  Sadly, it captures the essense of how women were undervalued as professionals and too often exploited by the opportunistic and arrogant energies of the then Patriarchial society where men dominated. The series also showed how smoking and drinking alcohol to excess, especially in the workplace was a very real, accepted and working part of society at all levels.  The character development was EXCELLENT and the energies of each individual became real, at least in my mind.  The series also characterized the times where the dollar ruled and Capitalism was more innocent, as the advertising business set the tone for America along with the rise of television and the early stages of media hype.  The politics were also well developed and blended skillfully into the series. Interestingly, the ego's of the key players were colorfully portrayed and the emphasis and swagger of \\"pecking order and proces\\" was also well-done relative to the corporate march in America. The romances were sordid and passionate and gave credibility to the timeless human condition of Libedo over Credo.   MADMAN was and is a quintesential classic of American Culture and should be mandatory viewing for students of the so-called American Dream, at least in the developmental stages.  Simply put, MADMEN is a CLASSIC!    Capt. Rick Rotundo
0446581348|2.0|This book should be titled \\"How to put on Makeup\\". It is so basic, who doesn't know how to do a smoky or glam eye. The rest of it is just basic, I was very disapointed and I didnt learn anything new.
006176759X|4.0|Given my fascination with Lauren Conrad, I was excited to read her loosely autobiographical first novel, L.A. Candy. The novel started off rather slowly for me, but once Jane, our heroine, and her feisty best friend, Scarlett, were picked to be on a new reality tv show, the story picked up. It was fun to guess which characters and traits were based on real people, but it seemed most characters were combinations of reality and imagination. The behind the scenes look at how reality works was absolutely fascinating. I watched The Hills become clearly less real over the seasons, but it was still enjoyable to watch. It was fascinating to see these characters react to the sudden change in their lives.<br /><br />L.A. Candy is not a great work of literature, but it was a delightfully fun read. It's the first in the series, and I'm looking forward to reading Sweet Little Lies, the second installment, soon. I recommend it to fans of young adult novels and fans of The Hills.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|After falling in love with the Sookie Stackhouse book series, I was anxious to see what the True Blood HBO Series was like and how it compared to the books.  Am I ever sadly disappointed!  The characters are nothing like a reader would imagine.  Eric is the worst as he looks nothing like described in the book.  And if you aren't into PORN than you might not want to watch this series as nearly every episode has nudity and strong sex scenes.  Do not watch with your kids awake!  The show is still interesting and entertaining but nothing like what i would have expected. I was told the show was more kinky and gory than the the books, that doesn't even describe it.
1608201236|5.0|I really do not know what else to say that had not been said in other reviews. I thought it was a great wrap up and enjoyed every second of Jake and Adrien's final adventure. I never hated Jake as much as some readers did before that book, but Adrien was certainly my favorite character out of the two of them. I am glad that in this book we can see more of Jake and actually *see* more of real him, I do like him now, a whole lot that is. :)
0061876747|4.0|In this suspenseful story, set in a backdrop of big-Pharma corporate sordidness, a pharmaceutical firm Calenture-Deutz based in London is on the verge of bringing an unprecedented anti-asthma drug Zembla-4 to market. Their renown researcher Philip Wang practically stumbled into his discovery, but has led the effort to establish its effectiveness through numerous test trials. It's not too surprising to see a predatory competitor circling. The opportunity to make billions with an exclusionary patent drives an even larger big-Pharma firm in a takeover attempt. But very serious complications have arisen. People in the test trials have been dying unexpectedly, the fact of which has been well concealed by complicit medical and administrative personnel. But Wang is a scientist, not a fat-cat, with a predisposition to truthfulness. When he threatens to expose the cover-up, he is assassinated by a cold-blooded operative from a clandestine firm composed of crack ex-military types (can we say, Blackwater) that exists to clean-up such unpleasant messiness for soulless entities, like corporations.<br /><br />It is at this point that the novel takes off on a harrowing, if not improbable, journey of survival and discovery, with any number of digressions into London life, much of it on the seamy side. Adam Kindred, a scandalized PhD climatologist, has just returned to London after several years in the US for a job interview, hoping to recover his life. Instead of renewal, his life takes a dramatic change for the worse. A kind deed on Adam's part to return a sheaf of papers after a chance encounter in a restaurant finds Dr. Wang with a knife in his ribcage and the killer apparently lurking in the apartment. Adam does the rash, stupid thing and runs, knowing that his fingerprints are on the knife and that he signed the guest register in the lobby - in his mind, overwhelming evidence. So begins a dicey, months-long life of changing identities and appearances, hiding in a thicket along the Thames where he bathes and even eats a captured bird, posing as a blindman/beggar, accepting church meals after agonizingly long sermons, living with a street-walker and her young son who she keeps drugged in a notorious London slum, and assuming the purchased identity of a fellow church attendee when he suddenly overdoses and then taking his job as a hospital porter. The relentlessness of the assassin makes all this movement necessary, as he patiently tracks Adam using money and violence to come ever closer.<br /><br />A couple of other appealing characters appear. While it is hard to commiserate with CEOs, Ingram Frazer, the head of Calenture-Deutz and a man of some integrity, is being subtly shoved aside by ruthless execs, kept in the dark of the scheme to gain acceptance of a drug with lethal implications. His comfortable life is also being assaulted by some increasingly frequent signs of health problems. Rita Nashe is an attractive veteran policewoman assigned to the unit that patrols the Thames. She keeps intersecting with Adam, though usually indirectly, such as investigating a complaint of a protected bird being killed. Achieving some level of confidence in being armed with an official ID declaring himself to be Primo Belem, Adam actually meets Rita when he comes forward to identify a deceased woman from a sketch in the newspaper, the victim of a violent assault. Interestingly, the chemistry between Adam and Rita is pretty much immediate with a relationship developing - probing questions not being pursued. The recovery of the renamed Adam is further evidenced as he  translates his job into a mission of accessing hospital personnel and data to dig into the damaging information that Wang had been carrying.<br /><br />While this novel is hardly of the non-stop action variety, the plot moves along fairly well with a certain amount of timing that is fortuitous for Adam. The author's probing of the underside of London, the somewhat unsettled life of Rita, andcorporate personalities and machinations adds substance without much cost to flow. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the novel is the fizzling out of most of the interesting threads. Any tidy or justice-laden endings will have to wait for another day.ies and machinations adds substance without much cost to flow.

0385341008|5.0|A very enjoyable book that I've shared with others.  One friend even purchased a copy from Amazon after reading it because it was a keeper.  My husband liked it and we usually don't read the same type of books.
B002XMGJIU|5.0|This new reissue of the Eighth Wonder album \\"Fearless\\" gathers much of their limited output onto one disc thanks to the bonus tracks. This virtually unknown group with a female vocalist has a surprisingly major lineup of producers behind the wheels of their extremely pop sounds. Mike Chapman of Blondie fame produces \\"When the Phone Stops Ringing\\" and \\"Will You Remember.\\"  None other than the Pet Shop Boys, along with Stock Aitken Waterman remixer Phil Harding handle \\"I'm Not Scared.\\" And finally, the remaining tracks are produced by another S.A.W. alum, Pete Hammond, who most often handled the softer S.A.W. remixes like Rick Astley and Jason Donovan while Phil Harding was in charge of harder acts like Dead or Alive.<br /><br />The majority of their sound is sugary bubble gum pop, much of which harkens back to 1960s influences, not uncommon for 80s music. My favorite tracks include Chapman's \\"When the Phone Stops Ringing\\" with its pop rock girl group vibe and the incorporation of the riff from Blondie's \\"Heart of Glass,\\" and the Pet Shop Boys produced \\"I'm Not Scared\\" which the band actually recorded themselves as well. The track pretty much sounds like a Pet Shop Boys song sung by a female.<br /><br />Other than those two songs and the producers involved, don't expect a `new wave' type of record or even a Stock Aitken Waterman dance album. This is truly pure bubble gum pop. Fun yes. Outstanding? Not so much. But if you are a hardcore 80s collector, it's worth it adding this to your collection, especially thanks to the inclusion some 12\\" versions. However, it is to be noted that there is a major error in the fact that the song Baby Baby is supposed to be on here as a bonus track in its 12\\" version, but instead, they've simply repeated the album version!
B001UV4XWY|4.0|This movie isn't due all the bad comments. If you're a fan of science fiction and gripping psychological thrillers in a Hitchcock style, chances are you'll love it. I think much of the lack of praise comes from those who are looking for your average popcorn thriller and this isn't it. Yes, Cameron Diaz overacts every scene but that aside if you can pay attention to the gripping themes of the movie it's really pretty good. If you are looking for aliens and explosions this isn't for you. If you like your movies layered and don't mind having to use your brain a bit to pay attention and think about the movie after it's over I'd say check it out for sure.

B002SF9YUM|5.0|Hey everyone,    Well for those who are buying this movie for their Gooey eyed Son or Daughter Because of the Heart Throb Knowen as Robert Pattinson Please read this review. I bought this movie for my 12 year old sister who is madly in love with the Twilight star, Not knowing this movie has content in it that is not in my opinion good for anyone under the age of 16. The movie it self has a great story line and plot, Very much an art film but for those who know the story behind the movie the subject matter is about a Famous painter \\"Dali\\" Played by Pattinson, but what they don't tell you on the package is that the story is about his dealing with being Gay, I myself being gay found the film a great art piece but the Nude scene, The sex scene with pattinson Masterbating in the corner while his friend makes love to a women a little bit inappropriate for a child to watch even with an Adult in the room. after seeing this movie with my sister i took the movie back and now keep it in my collection. If you are a parent who does not care about the content then this is a great movie, but if you do care please if you buy make sure you're child or children know about the subject matter. After seeing this movie my Sister will never look at Robert Pattinson the same way again and has told me and her friends she will not even see the Third movie in the Twilight Saga, It made her that upset. For the Gay men and women out there this is a great film and someone with the eye for art will really love this film.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  Simply fabulous!  I highly recommend it.  It's obviously about three drag queens.  The queens, and the princess go traveling, and along the way, encounter the usual mishaps.  The characters go through very real, relatable emotions and feelings along the way.  It's humorous and heartwarming, all at the same time.  Definitely a feel good movie.  It left me wanting more.  I didn't want it to end.  Too bad it wasn't longer, or a sequal.  This is one movie, given the same cast, and a good director, that a sequal would have been welcome.  What are you waiting for, go out and get it, or order it!  Enjoy.

1591843162|3.0|Seth Godin is a gifted inspirational speaker.  He brings ideas and experience from every facet of life to bear on his case, and you are left with little doubt that he is 100% right.    In Linchpin, he leads you to the best vision of yourself and insists nothing less will do.  I personally gained a great deal from reading Linchpin.    But I gotta say, man, \\"linchpin\\" is not a great word to use here.  I tripped over it all through the book - an unpleasant choice of word.  Maybe I'm too literal minded.  Calling things by their right names is the beginning of intelligence, and all that.  So the detours to the hardware store were not welcome.    And as much as I respect and enjoy, him, though, I don't like his writing style.  A bit ADD for me.    But he offers so many words to live by.  Words that have improved my life in the last few weeks: \\"Love what you do, or fail.\\"  When I view my job through that lens, I realize how much I really love what I do.  I'm happier and more effective, and that's contagious to the people I work with, and for that, Mr. Godin, I thank you very much!
1594488843|2.0|The book is about Motivation and it is a bit gimmicky, like Motivation 1.0 to Motivation 2.0, etc.    In the digital economy, autonomy, mastery, and purpose are treasured, and motivation is more intrinsically driven. This sounds great on paper. But many people still live in the not entirely digitalized world, and external motivation in terms of Carrots and Stick still work in some under-developed countries.

0786168765|4.0|Shantaram audio book was such a treat.  If you use your audio books to survive your commute, enjoy learning about other cultures and love to hear the different voices and characters created for your  amusement, this  is the book for you!  What I like about it is that you can smell Bombay, you can see all the details the way the author meticulously describes everything.  Please keep in mind some people are annoyed by that, if you are one of those, this book is NOT for you.  This book has 34 CDs,  and there were two sections in which the main character and his \\"mentor\\" talk about what is good and bad and I forwarded right through it... booring.  As much as I enjoy romance novels, this is not a love story even though the main character does have a love interest.  Again the main pull for me was the India experience, I really enjoyed being immersed in another world, and the reader WOW!!!!!  I chose my next audio book based on this reader and not the author.
B001GWUBSC|3.0|No subtitles - which makes watching this very frustrating if you don't hear well. As for the story - just OK. The lead actor is annoying. I never feel convinced by it.

0792839730|5.0|This is a good film in that it was not only entertaining, but a good way to learn history in WWII. I watched the film, but thought that maybe it was \\"Hollywood-ized\\" in the story. I looked up this battle and was surprised to see how it was a big disaster. I was shocked to know that British Intelligence was aware of the Panzer Division waiting for the Allies.    To cater to the ego of one man (Montgomery), whose plan this was, was unbelievable! I never could understand how he was such an acclaimed hero.
0439023483|5.0|This was my 1st Suzanne Collins read. I started the book thinking, \\"Oh, another 'Lottery',\\" figuring I'd put it down when it got too predictable.  And ended up finishing the book! As an old sci-fi/fantasy buff from way back it takes a lot to impress me.  Although the story pulls in some predictable elements - Boy meets girl, apocolyptic world, Thunderdome/Running Man competitions, Collins went in such interesting directions, foiling my anticipated turnings.  I was amazed by this story.  Cursing that the 3rd book doesn't come out till August.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a truly remarkable story and is the most unbelievably greatest war story ever filmed.  From the uniforms, vehicles and the likeness of each actor to his character is awesome.  Not over-acted nor under-acted the cast could not have been better.  This story is so well done it almost matches the book and have never saw a film that I could say that before now.  The book did tell me a few more things not in the movie but only small, minor details.  Unbelievable.  I don't watch movies more than twice.  I have watched these disks 4 times each.  If you don't own this set you are missing a real life hero story that you will be lessor of a person for missing.  Will buy it again in Blue Ray now.

0375413405|5.0|First, the book's primary author is not Simone Beck as Amazon says.  It is of course Julia Child.  Many people will say not to buy this book because the recipes are too complex and people don't cook this way anymore.  But there are always special occasions, aren't there?  Maybe the wonderful thing is that this book, this way of cooking, has a purpose today, that being....<br />maybe we should see more everyday cooking times as special occasions.  The book is filled with plenty of recipes anyone can make, and since Julia Child was a stickler for using recipes, she includes everything that needs to be done, so her recipes seem a lot longer than usual.<br />The other important aspect of this book is that it shows us how to use spices and flavorings, something maybe we no longer do often enough.  Paying attention to procedures as well.  It shows us HOW to cook.  It's not just a huge list of recipes.  It's a much more important book than that.<br />I recommend it highly for gourmet cooks as well as for those of us who want to learn to appreciate the art of cooking, in contrast to just throwing something together.  This is an attitude of cooking that makes you want to celebrate food as a way to celebrate family and friends.  Don't hesitate!  A beautiful book.<br />[[ASIN:0375413405 Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1]]
0385340575|1.0|What a stinker. I really can't believe how popular these Reacher novels are. I took it out of the library because I wanted to get Childs' take on writing first person. Geez, how many times can you go up and down the same subway track, to the same drab gray buildings? And pages of clipped-phrase dialogue with virtually no attributions to help the reader keep track of who is saying what. I think Child was just filling pages, to fullfill a contract for a Reacher novel of X pages, due by a certain date.<br /><br />And for a super genius who can do calculus equations in his head while doing acrobatics between killing terrorists, he sure is a moron.<br /><br />Example: in his big one-man attack on Terrorist HQ in NYC, he kills the fifth or sixth terrorist, who drops a loaded SIG pistol with 9 bullets in it. Does Reacher keep the  loaded pistol for a backup, in case his MP-5 submachinegun runs out of bullets? NO. Instead, he takes the time to unload the pistol magazine, and put the nine loose rounds of 9mm ammo into a pocket. He doesn't load them into his subgun, which would make sense. Or keep the loaded pistol, which would make sense. Instead, he unloads the pistol, and puts the nine bullets loose into a pocket!<br /><br />So you just  KNOW he is going to run out of ammo in his subgun at the climactic moment. Oh, sure! Super genius Reacher!  This is such a badly plottted key element, it's  just pathetic. Was Child in too much of a hurry to get this manuscript turned in by a deadline, that he couldn't go back and perhaps change the MP-5 (given to him by friendly federal agents, sure!) for a pistol with less ammo?<br /><br />Instead, Child keeps Reacher with the 30-round MP-5, but somehow, he must run out of bullets just before the Big Scene. So super genius Reacher does two things NO semi-competent shooter would EVER do. First, he sets his subgun to 3-round-burst mode, thinking, literally, \\"Nine terrorists, nine bursts, and one left over.\\" As if ANY shooter would be so cocky as to assume he will NEVER miss, going alone into a building full of armed terrorists! NO shooter would waste ammo on such an assumption.<br /><br />Second, he UNLOADS the found pistol, turning a useful pistol and nine bullets into NOTHING! He neither takes the loaded pistol, nor loads the extra 9 bullets into his nearly empty MP-5.<br /><br />This, in the Big Climax of the novel. Super genius Reacher must be a moron....or Lee Child thinks his American readers are.<br /><br />And maybe they are, judging by the millions of books he's sold.cky as to assume he will NEVER miss, going alone into a building full of armed terrorists!

B002C6A6N6|2.0|The series is great, Amazon is great, the price was great; however, be forewarned: the production of these DVDs from A&E was very bad.  Several of the DVDs in each season had a glitch, i.e., the sound/dialogue didn't match up with the actors' speech/movements.  It was out of sync.  We sent it back for a replacement which Amazon was great about, and the same thing happened again but just to the first season of DVDs, so it's hit or miss.  It's a shame because this was a gift for Christmas.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with my DVD player.  These were the only DVDS that this has ever happened to out of all the movies we own.    I'm really disappointed that A&E didn't have quality control on these.

B00243FQFA|4.0|No problems with the discs on this set or any other in the series. Great product and value.    I'm a fan of SG-A, but the series peters out somewhat during this season. Its long running serial storylines become spread really thin, so its no surprise why they canceled the series altogether. On the other hand there were some really good one-off, self-contained episodes in this season, such as \\"Whispers\\" and \\"Remnants\\"... The series would have benefited from another half dozen of these. And I thought the \\"First Contact/Lost Tribe\\" mini-series was thrilling for the first 3/4 of it. \\"The Prodigal\\" was a satisfying conclusion to one of the longer running storylines, but in the end it seems like the show ultimately went down with Michael, Todd, and the other overused characters and stories that were dragged on for too long.    Good series overall. I would recommend the 5 seasons to anyone.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|`Wanted' was one of those action movies at the time of its release in theaters that people looked forward to. It looked promising and had a fine cast. The results were disappointing.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Angelina Jolie, this movie would have gotten a 2 star review from my part. The whole plot was very silly and obviously the action sequences a little hard to believe. The movie does have its interested moments; Angelina walking out of a Jacuzzi butt naked and some action scenes that were very well made. But besides all that it was a let down, expecting a further deliberation of a film instead of a flick that at moments looked like a kid had genuinely written the script.<br /><br />I rented `Wanted' on blu-ray when it came out and if you're into movies simply for the quality on your screen then I highly propose for you to get this one. Check out Angelina's scene walking out of the hot tub in slow motion. Extraordinary!
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|If you are a fan of David Tennant's Doctor Who and you know who you are, this high defination blu-ray set is an absolute MUST HAVE for your collection. That being said, I do have the other seasons that are not in blu-ray. This specials set is soo completely worth it.  Seeing the common mundane details of the scenes are stunning.  The clarity of picture and color only intensify the emotional impact  that our beloved doctor and friends, who we have come to know and love as well, bring to these specials. This set can be enjoyed by the whole family, as it is in my home.  David Tennant and writer Russel T. Davies are both greatly loved and will be greatly missed.  May the next Doctor be as well loved!
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Like many fans out there, you're probably wondering what in the world the 1.11 rebuild of Evangelion is considering the 1.01 release is barely four months old.  While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases, 1.11 isn't the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting (lack thereof) issues addressed, the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material.<br /><br />Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a two-disc set, with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity.<br /><br />Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well.<br /><br />Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc.  Included: Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01 (Shiro Sagisu Version, Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version), \\"Angel of Doom\\" Promotional Music Video, News Flashes, Movie Previews: Preview 1 - Color-corrected version, Beautiful World Version 2, Beautiful World Version 2A, and Beautiful World Version 2B.<br /><br />The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here. However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking \\"Angel\\" comes to town. It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions.<br /><br />Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process. Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi's life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom.<br /><br />So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here. The answer is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to set it straight.<br /><br />Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan. Two years later the work was \\"rebuilt\\" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort. The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn't quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually. Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film. It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material. As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.11 release, which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together). Obviously, part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story.<br /><br />If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film. It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear.<br /><br />Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment. Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji.<br /><br />Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion's symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction.<br /><br />In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion. The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity's savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence. Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed.<br /><br />The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals. The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation's finest performers. Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work.<br /><br />In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time. The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process. Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology's capabilities. Considering the asking price of the new build isn't much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release, this is the recommended choice.released together).

The first few days I hated it but I am in Level 2 now and moving right along with results! I highly recommend her DVD.

1435248244|4.0|I am a 13 Year old student. I read this book for a school assignment and was suprised how good it was. The Pros of this book was that it was full of suspense and drama like when Tally crashes the party at the garbo mansion and escapes by a bungie jacket. Cons of this book was the slang for words got confusing. If you like futurstic and semi romantic stories i would definetely reccomend this. Heres a quick summary, A girl named Tally is an Uglyand her friend Peris is a pretty so one ady she decides to look for him at a party but, never finds him. She goes on an adventure with a girl named Shay to become a pretty and this story will definetely keep you on the edge of your seat. Imagine on a hoverboard zooming running away from Specials[police]. This story will not dissapoint. To be honest i don't know how much this book was as i did it for a school assignment but, looking at the price it looks very good for a book like Uglies.
0385504225|3.0|I'm a Dan Brown fan. I really like his other books (with the exception of the so-so Digital Fortress). I also like Dan Brown's writing for the most part.I read this book and was quite entertained for the first two thirds of it. It had lots of interesting stuff, clever twists, and decent pacing. Unfortunately after that the plot holes were just so unbelievably huge (I actually can't believe an editor let this go, a high school writing student wouldn't make these mistakes), that it left a bad taste in my mouth. There were tons of things that ignore the painfully obvious and things that just could not and would not happen (and character stupidity that's inconsistent with who they are). Oh yeah the climax was utterly anticlimatic. Really shocking this passed the tests before it was published. I will read future books by Dan brown but I sure hope both he and his editors never make these worse than rookie mistakes again.If there is a movie I'm sure they'll make big changes to the story. Not his best work, his worst in fact. Im usually ok with books that are entertaining, unique and decently written and I'm not normally real critical, but there were too many big flaws in this one to not mention them.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|A nostalgic trip for all those who have read  the Harold Foster books. The film is reasonably true to the beginning of the Prince Valiant series .  A young Robert Wagner is suitable in the lead role as the exiled Viking prince ably supported by the georgeous Janet Leigh and James Mason who portrays the Villainous Black Knight, Sir Brack.  But it is Sterling Hayden as Sir Gawain  , looking terribly uncomfortable in a wig that doesn't quite fit, who  steals the show.  A classic film that portrays the pageantry  and beauty of  mystical Camelot in Cinemascope but refreshingly does not focus on King Arthur. Instead it follows the adventures of Prince Valiant as he seeks to slay the Viking traitor  Slygon and reclaim his father's throne.  With an excellent musical score,  this action packed movie is good value viewing for the whole family.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|The Truman Show     The Truman Show featuring Jim Carry, is about a guy who lives in a pretend world.  He is unaware that his everyday life and job are not real.  He is also unaware ha the entire world is watching. This pretend world Jim Carry lives in is he perfect place with no crime and everyone is happy all the time.  I thought the movie was very well made and was one of he better movies done by Jim Carry.  After watching it, I thought there were many issues within the Christian world that can be compared to the movie. One is how Christians separate ourselves from the world and make our own.  Another is how Christians raise their children.  There can also be another twist to the movie.  We see that Truman's life is controlled by the producer of the show, Christoff.  He can be seen as a God-figure because has has controlled Truman's life and all the events in it. So there are a few ways the movie can be looked at that I will be addressing.     In the movie, Truman has what some call the American dream.  He has a house, a wife, and a good job.  All seems to be well in his life.  He has no problems.  This is why, in reality, his life is a TV show.  People find it entertaining that he lives in a separate ''world''.  I think sometimes Christians, especially in our culture, have tried to create our own world.  We separate ourselves so much from the outside world, or reality, that we are blinded by what is really going on in the world.  We try to make Christianity into what so often looks like the world Truman lived in.  We need to face the fact that God has placed us in the world in order to share the Gospel with people that have not heard it.  This means going out into the world where that are many problems.     Another issue I saw in the movie that could be related to our culture or Christianity is how Christians raise their children.  Truman was sheltered from the outside world.  He did not know what it was like to deal with real life issues.  His life was completely controlled by the producer of the show.  I can see how this relates to Christians because we try to shelter people from the world and control their lives.  I think it's important to allow kids to make their own choices and learn from their mistakes.  That said, it is also important to have a balance of allowing kids to make their own choices and knowing when to intervene and take control.  If we shelter our children from he outside world how will we expect them to be interact with non-believers?     The last two points I made have many similarities.  The next thing I saw in the movie was different from the above points.  Truman's life was controlled by the producer.  Everything he did was already thought out and planned.  He didn't know why certain events in his life occurred.  As a follower of Christ, I believe God has everything in my life planned, he knows whats going to happen before it happens.  Knowing that God is in control and that I am forgiven for my sins, I know I can experience true freedom.      -Sam

0312427999|4.0|Klein's book has been extensively reviewed and much quoted. Its well worth a read for anyone interested how the Right has captured public policy over the last few decades.<br /><br />Klein demonstrates with many case studies how a highly organized resurgent Right, financed mostly by think-tanks supported by a committed coterie of very wealthy donors, have systematically prepared the agendas of global neo-liberal capitalism and used catastrophes, natural and man-made, to advance those agendas whenever and wherever the opportunities arise. From the murderous regime imposed by General Pinochet in 1970s Chile to the \\"clean slate\\" presented by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and beyond, this highly organized intelligentsia of the Right and the politicians, policy-makers and moneyed interests who support them have been ready to move into devastated areas of the world at a moment's notice to create \\"test cases\\" for their vision of a world in which society-equals-the market. Klein argues convincingly that this approach is based on the advocates' understanding that their policies and ideas would never command a democratic consensus and must therefore be imposed, for the good of those who resist them and the world at large of course.<br /><br />Klein's critique of this process adds an interesting and important dimension to understanding how power operates in contemporary global capitalism. While it is sometimes true to say that powerful interests and those who represent them depend on opacity, that is hardly an explanation of how policies genuinely harmful to working people actually gain traction and become public policy. This analysis documents with very specific proofs one important way that process operates in actually existing capitalism. It is essential reading for anyone interested in how a viable counter-strategy to it might be generated.
B003102JDM|2.0|Big disappointment from Joel and Ethan Coen, who deliver a Jewish black comedy that is all setup and no payoff. &#34;A Serious Man&#34; (2009) has its virtues — Michael Stuhlbarg's engaging performance and the artful cinematography of Roger Deakins. All for naught, since the Coens keep the audience at arm's length while switching stylistic gears too often. A maddeningly abrupt conclusion ruins the entire film. Deeply personal yet oddly detached by Coen standards.

Every other song is really very enjoyable... some greatly so; my favorites are Making Flippy Floppy and Pulling Up The Roots, but I actually found out about the CD through This Must Be The Place. This album truly is a work of art, and a good first buy for those new to the band. (I should know; it was my first!)

If you do remember the time, it is a worthwhile reminder of events and people that should not be forgotten.

1594488843|5.0|\\"Drive\\" is an excellent take on what motivates people in modern society compared with times past. Things it covers are:<br /><br />1. A couple of decades ago rhesus monkeys solved a puzzle without a reward of food, water or sex. They began playing with it and solved it, implying a thrid drive - some intrinsic reward. They even made more errors when an external reward was used - raisens. Then, more recently similar results were found in an experiment (a Soma puzzle) with humans, implying humans also have this third, intrinsic, drive - for novelty, challenge, with scientific proof counter to what business usally does to motivate workers.<br /><br />2. Like computers, societies have operating systems - a) Motivation 1.0 - in older times just for survival, b) Motivation 2.0 - the industrial revolution led to rewards and punishments, carrots and sticks to motivate workers, c) Motivation 2.1 - some refinements like flex hours and casual dress, d) Motivation 3.0 - purpose driven rather than monetary compensation - think Wikipedia versus Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia, Firefox, Apache web server, Linix. Strongest motivation - enjoyment. Vermont - first state to implement a new business organization, \\"low profit limited liability corporation\\" with purpose maximized rather than profit.<br /><br />4.  Behavioral economics shows people motivated also by irrational motives. US census showed many non-employer businesses. Financial rewards can turn play into work - reducing performance, loss of creativity.  - the Sawyer Effect.<br /><br />5.  Extrinsic rewards can work for left-brain algorithmic tasks, but not for right-brain flexible problem-solving, creative solutions - can lead to bad, even unethical behavior and sort-term thinking like what led to the recent Great Recession - too much pay caused epic problems. Goals which lead to mastery are good - rewarding the activity better than rewarding the result.<br /><br />6. Rewards best if unexpected, not if-then but now-that.<br /><br />7. Self Determination Theory (SDT) - Type I person - 3 needs of a Type I person: a) autonomy - over 4 T's - task, time, technoque, and team, b) mastery - a flow - 3 laws to get in the flow - mindset, pain, asymptote - getting closer and closer to perfection but never reaching it, c) purpose - words are important like having an oath, when an employee says \\"we\\" rather than \\"they\\" for the company.<br /><br />8. Toolkit for a Type I person - a) flow test - one sentence for a person like freed the slaves for Lincoln, b) small question - like was today better than yesterday, c) take a \\"sagmeiter\\" - a sabbatical like every 7 years - do something different like travel, d) do annual personal performance reviews, e) get unstuck by going oblique - by pushing out of a mental rut, f) move 5 steps closer to mastery - deliberate practice, g) 3x5 cards with question/answer to give meaning to each day, h) create your own motivational poster.<br /><br />9. Nine ways to get your organization to be Type I - have 20% free time, encourage peer-peer now-that rewards, conduct an autonomy audit, take 3 steps to giving up control, play \\"whose purpose is it?\\", Reich's pronoun test - we or they, design for intrinsic motivation, Goldilocks for groups - not too easy, not too hard tasks, turn offsite into \\"FedEx day.\\"<br /><br />10. Type I compensation - get it right then get out of sight. Ensure internal, external fairness - harder job gets paid more, etc. Pay more than average.<br /><br />11. Tips for parents on how to motivate kids: homework - autonomy, mastery, purpose, have a FedEx day, Do It Yourself (DIY) report cards, don't combine allowances and chores, praise strategy and effort not IQ, let kids see the big picture of things.<br /><br />Overall, this book is very insightful and an easy read - recommended.e I person - 3 needs of a Type I person: a) autonomy - over 4 T's - task, time, technoque, and team, b) mastery - a flow - 3 laws to get in the flow - mindset, pain, asymptote - getting closer and closer to perfection but never reaching it, c) purpose - words are important like having an oath, when an employee says \\"we\\" rather than \\"they\\" for the company.    8.

B00005JLEX|1.0|I dont know whos idea of good shape is a defective product. First of all the box had more then a few scratches,it's falling apart. And second of all 2 of the disc are super scratched. I used to be a manager at a used video store so let me give you some advice, when a scratch goes in a complete circle that is considered a defective disc, there is nothing you can do to repair those. My biggest mistake is I didn't start watching the box set until yesterday so its probably to late to return.
0385751893|5.0|This is the most moving book I have ever read. I have read a lot of moving books before, but this one was different. At the end of it, I felt as though someone had just wrenched my heart right out of my chest. It's the type of book that leaves you stunned, horrified, and utterly devastated. Next to the Bible, it's quite possibly the most brilliant book I've ever had the pleasure of reading.    I don't want to tell you exactly what it's about, because I believe it's important to begin without really knowing what you're reading about, with a sense of child-like naiveté, because the story is told from the perspectives of children who don't fully understand their circumstances and surroundings. All I can do it tell you to go read it. Read it now. It won't take long, perhaps three or four hours total. It's a very short, simple book.

I could get my cpu to about 3.8ghz with this cooler.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|This was an interesting read for me.  There is some I agree with and some I disagree with or just don't \\"get.\\"  Perhaps I'm not entirely ready to be awakened.<br /><br />I did think/notice that portions of the book seemed to be a form of repackaged Buddhism for the Western world/culture.  This seemed to be Eastern thinking for the Western culture.  I like this idea because there are parts of such thinking that are just not usual in our culture.  I also thought it was interesting that he pulled ideas from Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and probably others I just didn't catch.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the book, I was often distracted by Tolle's \\"vanity\\" (not sure if that's the right word).  I sometimes felt he was preachy and kept wondering how big his house is if indeed objects mean nothing.  I also felt that telling the reader from the get-go that if he/she didn't agree with or understand the ideas put forth, then the reader just wasn't ready to be awakened.  I felt like that was a cop out.  Tolle should have just made his points and let the reder decide if he/she is ready or even wants to be awakened.  I couldn't tell if it was resistance in my own head to opening my mind to beliefs different than my own or if he truly sounded that way.<br /><br />This book reminded me (in certain parts) of another book I read - Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman.  Might be worth a read if you liked Tolle's book.<br /><br />All in all I think A New Earth has some very interesting insights and can be useful in life, however I don't think it's life-altering for me.  I think this book can be immensely helpful for some people.  It might be life-altering for some, just not for me, but that's not the book's fault so I gave it 3 stars.  I think the book does what it's supposed to do.  Although I don't regret reading this book and I don't feel it was a waste of time, I don't think I would read another one from this auther.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This is the best all round movie so far on giving all of us who, will never set foot near a combat zone, an inside/close up look being part of a tense and tightly grouped bomb disposal unit in Iraq.  I couldn't wait to see this and I wasn't disappointed.  Should be more like this one. Definitely not one to be missed.  T.  Sydney, Australia.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|Peter has been responsible for some incredible music throughout his career, in fact, Up was probably his crowning achievement.  Few artists have stayed as vital so late in their career as Mr. Gabriel has so the thought of this project excited me.  I was really looking forward to his interpretation of these songs.  I have previous covers he has done through the years and some were quite good.  This album, however, does not fire on all cylinders to say the least.<br /><br />Yes, the album is a bit of a coma inducer.  His decision to do all the songs in the same manner is what causes this overall.  Some of the songs done with the voice/orchestration style work quite well such as The Boy In The Bubble where it gives the lyrics more gravity and The Book of Love.  But on songs such as Street Spirit (Fade Out) it completely falls flat.  Street Spirit is already a mellow song to begin with though the way it was originally arranged by Radiohead it feels perfect in tempo.  Peter's version is so mellow it almost sounds lazy.<br /><br />The point is that by sticking to one form of arrangement as he did on Scratch My Back it didn't allow for the experimentation Peter is well known for.  I give it three stars only because 2.5 stars isn't an option.  If you are a dedicated fan then you will find points of enjoyment for sure, if your a casual fan I would continue with albums you have missed from his back catalog instead.<br /><br />Its been eight years Peter, time to put out a proper album again.
B000F48D3C|5.0|This is a fantastic inside look to the adrenalin rush and dangers in modern war.  I was glued to this one.  Definitely a must see if you enjoy combat/war movies.  And one you will watch more than once.  T.  Sydney, Australia.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The head phones sound great.  It's amazing how good music and video games can sound with quality head phones like these. It soooooo cool being able to tell which direction a sound is coming from in my games. To bad the mic only works with Xbox 360. The head phones work with anything with a HD optical output. So it works with my BDD and PS3, as well as my Xbox 360. But the mic only works with the Xbox 360.

B00005NB8K|3.0|The Doors. I don't very much understand this movie. Not for the story but I am unsure where Oliver Stone was coming from with this take on the life and death of Jim Morrison. Did Stone have an axe to grind? It seemed that way. I have read several books and watched footage of him as well as interviews with those closest to him. Yes, Morrison did have issues with alcohol that at times rendered him ( I am sure) unbearable and obnoxious but it seems this is all we ever see. The character is very one dimensional. Val Kilmer has the look and feel of Morrison down pat. Unfortunately, he had to follow Stone's portrayal which is where the problem is. There was another side that Stone neglects entirely. Morrison in interviews tended to be very soft spoken, shy. We never see this side as it is thrown aside to have the arrogant Morrison 24/7 stoned and /or drunk staggering around spouting lines from songs that were still unwritten and at times written by other band members. Morrison was a talented poet and troubled person with his own demons; however we never get to see this in favor of flamboyant and at times inaccurate depictions.<br />There are some pros to this movie. Some of the cinematography is beautiful, and Kilmer did a great job of sounding like the real Jim Morrison. The music and the feel is pure 60's heaven. I would like to have been around then to see a glimpse.<br />The movie has its' merits, but most will walk away for an utter dislike for Morrison which is based on a lot of falsehoods..

B0000931OG|3.0|\\"Experimental\\" albums can be tricky beasts. If done well, they can showcase a new and exciting side of a band, but if done poorly they can be self-indulgent messes that confuse and alienate the fans. Or sometimes, as in the case of `Think Tank', you end up with a bit of both.     Drawing on his time in Gorillaz, Damon Albarn pushes Blur further into dance and electronica, and also incorporates more classical arrangements as well as some African sounds. But too often, Albarn falls into the old trap of thinking \\"experimental\\" means piling on endless layers of instrumentation, and adding in unnecessary extended noodling that goes nowhere. The use of orchestration and especially the Moroccan influences does work well at times, but several songs are nearly buried under the overwhelming layers of horns, strings, keyboards, drum loops, and choirs. And despite the furious denials of die-hard Blur fans, Graham Coxon is sorely missed. These highly polished songs would really have benefited from Graham's guitar to give them a more organic, natural feel.    On the other hand, the scattershot, unfocussed nature of `Think Tank' is what makes it so unique. The album is full of ideas, even if not all of them work, and you're never quite sure where it will go next.     'Ambulance': think 'Tender' with an orchestra and drum machines. An excellent song and good introduction to the style of the album. Unfortunately, this is one of the songs with a pointless extended coda, which drags the song on about two minutes too long.    'Out Of Time': One of the more old-school Blur songs here, driven predominantly by guitars. The orchestration washes gently in and out of the mix, instead of swamping it as on some other songs.    'Crazy Beat': Heavier and more processed than many other songs on the album, and seems like an attempt to go for another `Song 2' US hit single. Doesn't fit that well among the more reflective tracks here, and not one of my personal favourites.    'Good Song': beautiful,restrained track driven by an acoustic guitar loop and Albarn's gentle vocals.     'On The Way To The Club': starts out well, a pleasant mid tempo dance-influenced track with wistful vocals and a strong chorus. But like `Ambulance', it ends on a meandering instrumental coda that does nothing for the song.    'Brothers And Sisters': The mantra-like singalong chorus is great, but the clumsy verses (either a celebration or satire of drug culture) don't work so well.     'Caravan': very subdued mood piece. A bit of a take-it-or-leave it song; some will regard it as deeply haunting and atmospheric, others will head straight for the Skip button.    'We've Got A File On You': short, sharp Eastern-tinged rocker immediately sparks things up after 'Caravan'. A highlight, despite being only a minute or so long.    'Moroccan People's Revolutionary Bowls Club': a personal favourite, and one of the best songs on the album. Funky, catchy, African-tinged track that's guaranteed to stick in your head for days.     'Sweet Song':   another subdued piece, driven by a gentle piano. A beautiful song, but as with 'Caravan' it does take a particular mood to truly enjoy.    'Jets': the only real shocker here. The song goes nowhere, the guitar line sounds like something from a low-grade demo, and the track ends on two minutes of directionless sax noodling.  No idea what Albarn was trying to do with this one. A very long six minutes which can be safely ignored.     `Gene By Gene': comes dangerously close to being another pointless diversion, but it picks up once it settles into its rhythm. Funky beat and singalong chorus saves this from becoming another `Jets'.     `Battery In Your Leg': poignant closer that sums up the best and worst of the album. The song has a fragile beauty, but is almost ruined by the out-of-nowhere walls of distortion and noise that appear halfway through the verses. The tender guitar solo from Graham Coxon just manages to save things.    As you can see, it's a real mixed bag, but even the less successful experiments are intriguing enough in their own way. I also suspect that different people will appreciate different tracks, depending on their mood and personal taste, although nearly everyone will find something they like here.     `Think Tank' is an album you need to put some work into, and it won't always reward you for your efforts. But this is what makes it one of the more interesting albums of recent times, and worth getting for that reason alone.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The Dark Knight is definitely not for small children, but grownups who enjoy Batman and appreciate a different dark moody feel.  For some reason Robin was not in the movie, but a lonely lovelorn Batman beset by tragedy.<br /><br />Batman (Christian Bale), upsets the Gotham City Mob.  There is also a new D.A., HaRvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), with blond hair and blue eyes and idealistic view on fighting crime.<br /><br />The Joker (Heath Ledger) appears and wants the Gotham City criminals to work with him and kill Batman.  Ledger does a fantastic performance as the Joker and provides some wry jokes as he devils his victims.  However, he is also frightening and hard to catch - one step in front of the Police.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the role of Rachel Dawes and Dent and Batman both love her.  There are plenty of action sequences and the special effects - especially Dent's face after an accident - are well done.  The film is dark but the artistic sets and cinema is excellent.
0307460444|2.0|I bought this book as i love the cupcake stores that are now opening.  I have been disappointed with martha because I have now realized she does not test her recipes.  I have made 8 of the cupcake recipes, and there is something \\"off\\" on every one, and all of these things are recipe flaws;  1- the tiramisu cupcakes call for coarse salt - the salt does not dissolve in the recipe and while eating the cupcake you will crunch into a large piece of salt  2- the rich chocolate frosting is very expensive to make, and the recipe advises you to refrigerate the frosting - this is not true; if you refrigerate the frosting, it becomes a large bowl of fudge; i had to melt the entire bowl of frosting in a double-boiler and then stir for about an hour to gain any consistency back  3- the chocolate chunk cupcakes taste good - but all the chocolate sinks to the botton of the cupcake; thus you have a chocolate bottom that sticks to the paper, and the top 3/4 of the cupcake is just a plain cupcake  4- the buttermilk cupcakes were very heavy - almost like a pound cake, the recipe made 36 cupcakes - the frosting to go with it makes enough for frost 24 cupcakes; i had to go out and buy more ingredients to make another batch of frosting  5- the peanut butter cupcakes turned out good, but the recipe says you can dip your fork into powdered sugar to make the fork marks in the frosting - it should be sugar, not powdered sugar  6- red velvet cupcakes turned out fine  7- cookies & cream cheesecakes turned out find  **all of the cupcakes taste good - however each recipe makes me anxious and there will always be one or two things that is not correct in the recipe; i've have to look up on the internet or call a cake store to fix the problems  **because of these things, won't use any Martha cookbooks in the future as she doesn't test the recipes.
1400031567|3.0|I agree with Stephen Laniel's review - the book just seems flat. And 400 pages of flat are too many.     I am reminded of talking with my sister-in-law.  If I ask how her weekend was, I get the answer to that, plus details on everything about the weekend, including what she had for dinner on Saturday night, how she cooked it, and how everyone at the dinner table dressed that night.    That is how Sidetracked felt to me - an interesting police procedural storyline almost buried in miscellaneous details and lots of uninspiring dialogue.      Perhaps if I had read earlier novels in the series, I would have had more attachment to and interest in Mankell's characters.  But I just didn't find myself caring much. So I labored through the book, always thinking maybe I should give up.  I made it to the end, and now am not quite sure why.
B0033AX20E|5.0|This reissue is simply awesome, the vocals sound amazing and there is no more echo effect on ZP's voice. It appears as though he completely re-recorded the entire vocal track on the album. The guitar effects also have drastically improved. I haven't watched the DVD yet, but I'm sure it'll be similar to what came with Ultra Beatdown DVD. If you're a Dragonforce fan buy this reissue. If you never heard of this band, by this and EVERY other album of this band, keep your mind open and you will love them. This is a great fix and a reminder of where the tale of this band began. The next album won't be around for over a year, so take what you can get. If you're reading this review after the 2011 album release, still buy this CD because it is a must have for your collection.    My first experience with Dragonforce was Valley of the Damned back in 2004, just before sonic firestorm came out. It was played on a heavy metal music channel provided by cablevision. Although I found the song to be amazing, even then I thought it needed better production.   I immediately looked the band up online and found out it was their first album and the second was a month away. Not being able to find 'Valley' anywhere in stores, I downloaded it off the web (i know its bad, but I had no choice). Listened to that album at least three times a day for the entire month until 'Firestorm' came out, which I bought day one and was once again blown away. This band instantly became one of my favorites among Helloween, Blind Guardian, Amon Amarth, Fear Factory and Ensiferum. Needless to say, I loved Inhuman Rampage and Ultra Beatdown, during the promotion of which I was finally able to see the band live and got to meet them and sign my shirt!!!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This CD has surpassed my expectations. Paramore never fails to give it's fans great music. Before I ordered the CD, I heard some songs on their website, and had to order it for myself. I was so excited when I ordered it and now I listen to them all the time.  Paramore has songs that are so positive and encouraging.  Great music to listen to with all ages. They will never get old.
1591843162|4.0|When first started to read this book I went to work the next day angry. Angry at the corporate system and the manufacturing processes that I honestly had a bad day. When continuing to read, Seth mad me realize I was angry for the wrong reasons. I should have been angry at myself for abiding by the system. Seth encourages you to step outside of the boundary and create your art. When you bring your art and give your gift to the workplace it allows you to form a passion for your work you never knew existed. I always new it took risks to stand out, but this book brings that to new heights. Allowing yourself to be human in the workplace, bring your emotional labor (the labor that makes up you) into the workplace creates a unique value. An irreplaceable value where you begin to make a difference and become a linchpin. The key is not to give in to the lizard brain - the voice in your head that persuades you to feed the resistance, to take the safe route and be content.    I really haven't read any of his other books but am pretty current with his blog posts. This by far is one of the best personal/professional development books I have read to date. He has a way with his words as if he's actually there being your own life coach or mentor, a one on one chat. For those who are needing a pick me up personally or a nudge to create art in the workplace, Seth will help you to achieve both.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love all Rocky movies...in fact I named my first daughter after a character in Rocky III -- Clubber.  I think it'll grow on her.  Anyway, I bought this set as it seems like such a great price.  I set aside an entire Saturday to watch all of them in a row but guess what? Not one of these discs work in my DVD player.  I must have spent 5-6 hours over the weekend doing everything I could think of to get these to work. Nothing.  So buyer beware -- these will not work in Philips or Sony DVD players for some reason.

0307266303|5.0|This book is a good, well-written story.  It tells the story of man's history of running through experiences the author shares about his life and the lives of other interesting characters he has met.  It is a very thought provoking and enjoyable book.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Overall this is a simply fantastic movie. Saw it in theaters several times and couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. If you like comedy you'll love this. It's action packed and keeps you laughing pretty much the whole time. Although the movie is quite funny, there are some somber moments throughout it. If you liked movies like Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead, etc. you will absolutely love this one and definitely won't regret the purchase. Blu-ray looks fantastic, but if you don't have a HD-TV don't bother and just buy the regular dvd!
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Fantastic, fast-moving thriller! I don't usually read thrillers, but I couldn't put this one down. I won't ever be satisfied with a slow-moving book again.
0545123267|4.0|I'm a fan of vampire stories and other books relating to the occult, but this is the first book I've ever read about werewolves. After this book, I must say that I've been converted. Werewolves are definitely sexier than vampires. The author does SUCH a good job of describing the animal magnetism thing. In fact, all of the author's descriptions in the narration were superb. I really felt like I was there - feel the cold, smell the scents, and touch the textures. It was very richly described. The only problem I had really was that the heroine was overly stoic - it was her main personality trait, and it was taken to the extent at one point toward the end that I no longer found her believable as a human being. I mean, kind of stoic is fine - I myself am a stoic person - but I just felt it was overdone to the point that she was too robot-like.    Overall, I loved this book and I can't wait to for the next one! Mind you, it's not a very deep or serious read, but it was very enjoyable. (In fact, it was a comfort read while I was sick. It was just the right speed). I'm recommending it to all my friends.    SPOILER WARNING! I'd just like to add one small warning for concerned parents: there is a single act of underage sex in this book (nothing descriptive and protection is used) so if that overly concerns you, then I wouldn't recommend this book.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I would think this has to be possibly the best movie ever and so rated as #1 when any discussions of such movies comes up. Its the only movie I come back to see again and again. I think I have seen it six times to date. It has excellent lines throughout, and also has excellent music. It has a humble atmosphere throughout, setting up the next 5 Rocky movies; where Rocky fights with complacent attitude, because of money and fame. Big budget films have an atmosphere of a spoiled director and actors, writers etc, and obviously after seeing this, one can see the difference. A humble movie with powerful lines and creativity, by a writer (Stallone) who at the time had maybe $200 to his name, and lived in a roach infested apt. turns out to be the best movie of all time.

0743455967|5.0|Funny, well written, enjoyable. My girlfriend isn't necessarily a Stephen King fan but she loved this book.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book. Multilayered - a story about scientific discovery, and how 1 little discovery can make such an impact on the world. A story about African-American life in the 1950's. A story about an author's obsession with a story she just has to pursue despite the odds. A story about a family in upheaval. A story about how the arrogance of scientists, researchers, and physicians creates so much suffering, and about how the honest dedication of scientists, researchers and physicians relieves so much suffering. And more. I listened to the audio version from [...], it was very well done.
0385528752|5.0|Using fascinating analogies involving elephants and their helpless riders, Chip and Dan Heath reveal some interesting secrets behind the often mysterious process of \\"change\\", and why it's so often difficult to implement.  Largely, the problems stem from a failure to clearly communicate precisely what it is we'd like people to change, and why it's the best course of action.  The good news is, most people don't embrace the concept of change simply because they don't understand the benefits behind it; they're not trying to be difficult; they just don't understand the game plan.<br /><br />The key is to develop ways to communicate the desired action plan of change, as well as keeping the process fairly simple.  Instead of grandious, complicated schemes which are practically impossible to comprehend, the successful plan involves simple steps that can be performed with relative ease; once the ball starts rolling, the momentum builds and the next thing you know, you've quite often accomplished something special.<br /><br />What the authors did exceptionally well is provide the reader with a much better understanding of the peculiar nuances of \\"changing things\\"; in the process, they've laid a solid foundation for achieving remarkable results; we just need to follow the directions.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|The is a different kind of scary space movie and the creatures are a little freaky I would rate this above average or a good rental movie
B002VKE1K2|4.0|The guy who plays the paranormal expert is so bad in this, he makes the two main actors seem like Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, which they definitely are not, except that the girl does convince you that she's troubled, and the guy, Micah, convinces you that he would be an awful pain in the neck to have as a boyfriend and enough with the camera already!<br /><br />I think he got the camera hoping to film the two of them having sex, and we see her putting the kibosh on that idea of his....  Then it all comes out about her past, and the gloves are off.<br /><br />Katie has been attracting ghosts since she was a young girl, and this fits with the Freudian theories of the late Nandor Fodor, whose seminal book The Haunted Mind (1960) explored a theory that would provide a psychoanalytic explanation for hauntings and the occult--particularly poltergeists, who seem to crop up only in households in which a young girl (in rare cases a boy) is undergoing the throes of puberty, as though the spirits were drawn to this energy.  Fodor speculates that the psychic energy is caused not only by hormones, but happens only when the subject has been molested, often by an older male figure in her family.<br /><br />Is this what happened way back when to Katie?  We notice that she has a younger sister whom, I expect, she was perhaps trying to protect from adult molestation by (manufacturing or inviting) the production of the poltergeist.<br /><br />Needless to say, this anger at predatory men finds its ultimate expression in--well, no more spoilers from me!<br /><br />I dock this movie one whole star because of the ridiculous way Katie pronounces the name \\"Micah.\\"  She sounds like an idiot, and so does he for replying.  But now I don't know, maybe it's the way the actor pronounces it in real life?  \\"Meekuh\\"?  Like \\"the meekuh shall inherit the earth\\"?
0061864153|5.0|This is truly a beautiful book and a must-have for Bon Jovi fans!! Get this book along with the album/CD and you're set! The added bonus on the CD is the DVD of the terrific, insightful documentary on the band! The book and documentary complement each other well and with the album playing in the backgroud, you're all ready for an evening of Bon Jovi!! Such a great book, album and especially the documentary from a band that usually keeps their lives private...very highly recommended!!!
B002M9WW30|3.0|When I was 13 my brother took me to the drive in to see Rocky.  I was hooked and have been a Stallone fan ever since.    I have the DVD boxed set as well as the cable HD broadcast, and now I have the Bluray box set.  Let me start by saying I haven't watched all the movies in the BD set, just the first one.  It is by far the worse picture quality of any versions I currently have.  Even the aspect ratio isn't the same as the theatrical release.  Seeing that the first movie is by far the best, and an academy award winning movie- I would have expected it to have gotten the royal treatment and to look the best.  Even if the rest in the set look great, this is a major disappointment, at least to me.    I know some have said in their review that the PQ wasn't that bad so I don't know, maybe there were bad discs released but I doubt it.  Mine have so much grain and noise I took the disc to another player to make sure something hadn't gone wrong with my bedroom BD player.  It was just as bad.  Actually it looked worse.  In the bedroom I have a 32\\" HDTV and downstairs I have a 55\\" HDTV and a 106\\" projector system.  The bigger you go the worse it looks because all that awfulness gets blown up bigger.  I'd never watch this on my projector yet this is one of my favorite movies and exactly the type of content I use the projector for.    I know this sounds pretty negative but the picture quality really is that bad, at least for my set.  I know the price was great, but if you are expecting Bluray picture quality you will be very disappointed.  This is a bad value at half the price...
B000PY52EU|3.0|Brewer's Southern sizzler is a rather tawdry and implausible study of redemption made interesting by good performances, a steamy atmosphere, and a rousing soundtrack. As a morality tale BLACK SNAKE MOAN is certainly a mixed bag. It revels from start to finish in its political incorrectness, and it's easy to see why some are offended by this film. It's also too self-reverential and would benefit from a sense of irony: the few moments of humour are all unintentional.  And yet, despite these flaws, this film provides compelling viewing and is a prime example of a guilty pleasure. Also worth noting is Christina Ricci's wide-eyed sex-appeal, which is extraordinary. Boy is she smoking'!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I absolutely love this album.. It was worth the wait! I love me some Sade!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my very favorite of six versions of Jane Eyre that I now own. While this version is not quite as true to the book as some of the older versions, it is a beautifully filmed movie of a classic love story (again one of my favorite stories).  I absolutely loved both the leading characters, Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  I feel this version with Toby Stephens probably portrayed Mr. Rochester better than any other version.  You really felt you understood his problems, and were much more sympathetic to his character.  You really felt his conflict between what he was and what he desired to be, had not such bad circumstances made him a bitter and at times harsh man.  I liked that his portrayal of Mr. Rochester was more feeling toward Adele than in most other versions.  Ruth Wilson was also superb as Jane.  At times she very well matched the description of a very plain young lady, but at other times, as when she was in private, reflecting on her growing feelings for Mr. Rochester, she looked really lovely!  I was really impressed with the way this version handled the love story.  While a little license may have been taken with what was the accepted behavior of the times, the love scenes were both believable, and done in good taste!  While the story got a little out of sequence from the book as to the parting between Jane and Mr. Rochester after the discovery that he was already married, I liked how the rest of what transpired between them was shown later in the film as flashbacks that Jane had as she remembered and grieved over her parting and loss.  (I cried along with her as she cried!)  I have watched this version so many times that I ordered a second copy, just in case I wear out the first dvd set!
B000003C2U|5.0|I dont think I have to say too much, I am just replacing this album for the 3rd time since 9th grade. Which sums up all I have to say, ITS A MUST HAVE! IT F***IN ROCKS! ITS A CLASSIC! ITS CHUCK! Nothing more is needed to say, and if you havent heard of Death then I dont know what to say other than buy it and hear what you have been missing. Chuck is 1 of the founding fathers of all that I love in metal.
0312330537|5.0|I can find no book that can follow this so I got the audio version and keep listening to it at least a couple times a year.      Shantaram has comedy, spirituality, history and big, big heart.  For those reviewers who say it is disjointed stories, this is the retelling of the author's experience, not written for pure fiction.  However I don't find it disjointed, and although the ending is bleak, it is the story of what happened to this society.    Love this book...the only other book I've read that can follow it is Abraham Verghese's Cutting for Stone.
0321344758|5.0|This really is a beautiful book. It does a wonderful job of following its own principles. Not only is it clear and simple, but also very effective. Many of the examples are really out of date, but the ideas that they illustrate continue to be evident throughout websites.    If you desire to learn more about simple web usability, this book is a must-read.
0743457900|5.0|Smiley's People and Tinker, Tailor are my favorite spy thrillers.  No one in the genre develops characters and twists and turns of plot like Le Carre.  I never thought Le Carre's stories after the Smiley saga were as good, but these two I read over and over.  My hope is they will become available for the Kindle, at which time they will become part of my permanent library.  I highly recommend them for anyone wanting an engrossing cold war read.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo was the first movie we took our 3 year old daughter to see. Not only was she captivated, we, her parents, were too. The story and animation was a breath of fresh air from the typical animated films being produced these days.     Our daughter was not scared during the film and repeatedly asked (over and over and over) to watch Ponyo again. Ponyo is a rarity, a film you can actually enjoy with your toddler.
0380799006|5.0|This book was recommended by Alfie Kohn (the highly recommended author of Unconditional Parenting) and I have found it to be well-written and kind. The authors emphasize listening to your children, freeing yourself from taking sides and putting an end to creating sibling competition through comparisons, for example. They guide you through these ideas and others in a very readable and clear, concise way. I like the cartoons too, as a quick visual reminder. Highly recommended!

1557048630|4.0|Great BOOK! WONDERFUL artwork! I love all the character designs that are coming out of Dreamworks for their movies!! BUT anyone else get a copy of it that the middle 12 or so pages where upside down and out of order? The one reason I DONT like getting stuff from AMAZON...no easy way to return and get your book instantly. ugh! And since it didnt come shrinkwrapped you think the publisher would have had a little more quality control. Great book...but a blemish on it that probably I will have to live with...? (Does that happen alot?)
B0036RPM8E|5.0|I've been a Bon Jovi fan for well over two decades.  I was excited to hear they would be releasing the MSG shows on a DVD/Blu Ray as their last concert videos have been filmed mainly in Europe (See[[ASIN:B000053ZRR Bon Jovi - The Crush Tour]] & [[ASIN:6305165971 Bon Jovi: Live From London]]) so you don't get to see the Arena set up or the lighting production they use.  But like most things the moving HD screens they used on the Lost Highway are amazing live, but not as impressive on a TV.<br /><br />To see this on Blu Ray is fantastic its like having a Bon Jovi concert in your living room.  Other reviewers complained about the editing, I thought the editing on the Crush Tour DVD was much worse, and that the vocals were over produced.<br /><br />One complaint, Bad Medicine over the credits.<br /><br />You also get a copy of the documentary \\"When we Were Beautiful\\" on this DVD/Blu Ray as well.  Its the censored version which makes no sense, you don't have the option of changing the audio to allow the cursing to come out.<br /><br />I bought my copy from Amazon.co.uk, it was well worth the $25.  It's a region 0 disc so it plays in any region, and it looks fabulous.

0446580945|4.0|Having the ability to write a captivating love story in modern-day language is something Nicholas Sparks has perfected.  The way he uses words to bring a story to life is one of a kind; Sparks writes with emotion and empathy while dealing with subjects that change peoples lives.   In Dear John, the story is told of a soldier who fought for and found honor and glory on the front lines of his heart.  Told as a heart-breaking first person narrative, this story isn't ornamental or embroidered; it's a simple story that cuts to the heart of the reader.        Sparks sets the stage for his tale by beginning the book with the main character, John Tyree, telling us about his long lost love, Savannah, and the relationship they once shared.  John presents the question to the reader of what love really is and then answers it according to what Savannah would have said it was; living happily with one another while accomplishing the simple dreams that every girl has of having a home and a family.  John goes on to say that \\"happily ever after\\" isn't always the answer; love calls for a greater surrender and sacrifice.  John and Savannah meet at the beach while John is home in North Carolina on leave from the Army, which has him stationed in Germany.  Savannah is a college student spending the summer building homes with Habitat for Humanity.  In the two weeks they spend together, they fall in love and agree to marry one another once he comes home from Germany 16 months later.  John and Savannah correspond through letters during these long 16 months and the reader sees their relationship peak and fall throughout.  Their marriage plan seems to be executing itself perfectly, but then September 11, 2001 happens, and John decides to re-inlist, which crushes Savannah.  The difficulty of a long-distance relationship puts a huge and constant strain on their relationship, causing them both to make some hard decisions.           Not only do John and Savannah share a very special relationshipthoroughout the book, but John and his father do as well.  John's relationship with his father had thinned because of John's frustration with his father's incapability to love or to talk about anything other than his collection of coins.  The relationship is one of challenges and complexities, but there are glimpses throughout the book where the reader can see the father loving the son, but he is unable to communicate it to John.  Savannah comes along and provides John with insight into his father's behavior that John had never been introduced to; the idea of Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of Autism.  As John continues to learn more about this condition, he comes to an understanding that allows him to re-establish a loving relationship with his father.          A compelling and best-selling author, Nicholas Sparks definitely knows how to capture his audience.  By telling a  very clear-cut story, the narrorator brings the reader close; he never lies to the reader, but neither does he ever tell too much.  Years after the events in the book take place, the narrorator is telling his story through a window of his own grief and remembrance.  This personal touch helps the reader to really value the passionate relationship between John and Savannah and helps him/her understand they both had the desire to make it work, but he/she knows all along that it ends in heartbreak.  One of the things that the reader wonders throughout the whole book is how this almost-fairytale like relationship could dissolve, and it leaves one consistently praying that something will happen or someone will intervene to change the outcome of heartbreak and loss seen in the prolouge of the book.     Not only is the story itself enchanting, but so are its characters.  In this particular book, the characters stand out because the energy they create makes the reader want to keep reading; Sparks' produced characters that are easily related to because they are typical people who face the same challenges and temptations that real people face on a daily basis.  When looking at the people that the characters portray, they are not pompous or haughty; they are characters who are ethical and honorable; they stand up for what they believe in, even if they're standing alone.  It was refreshing to read a novel where the characters had tenderness in their behavior and they held firm to what they valued.         Throughout the book, the themes portrayed are what carry the account from good to great.  The main theme of the book deals with the question of whether love is something that is purely sought out of selfish ambition or whether it is something that is cherished, prized, and valued, even if it ends with a broken heart.  Sparks' key message which stands out through this question is that, though tough and very intricate, the love shared between two people changes them forever.  For John, loving Savannah meant more than a fairytale; it meant sacrifice no matter the cost.  This message is one that speaks to contemporary culture today because it reminds us that love, when not sought out of selfish ambition, really is unstoppable.
1439190275|5.0|I got my book recently also and am loving it.  There were always \\"gaps\\" in the previous attempts at this topic even by Dr. Atkins.  This book puts sustainable low carb dieting into perspective.  I love the addition of real science and now know why I feel so good on low carb.  I am looking to loose another 30 pounds that have crept back on and will use the book to get back on a program that literally saved my life a few years back.    My doctors were impressed that I lost so much weight, brought my triglycerides down and ELIMINATED my need for insulin.  After hearing the low fat garb from the dietician my own research brought me to Atkins and low carb.  It was truly a God send for me.    Thanks for the great new book that is so easy to read and understand!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Saw this by accident--sort of.  I was at my cousin's house in Crisfield, Maryland and she had rented it.  Once I started watching it, I had to find out who did what and how. Although not my kind of movie, I have to admit it was VERY good.  BUT, it is very bloody and includes torture, beheading, and sodomy.  It even flipped my stomach a bit.  If you can handle that shock stuff, read on.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Gerard Butler and his family are confronted by burgulars.  He is tied up and forced to watch his wife sodomized and murdered by this rotten $#@$^& \\"person\\".  After that, he carries the daughter away.  Fortunately, they didn't show the details but you do find out he killed her.  Although stabbed and left to die, Gerard lives and is hell-bent on revenge.  He is a master on strategizing.  Even while he is in jail, people are dying brutally, one at a time.  But, is it him?  How can he kill people on the outside?  Does he have an accomplice?<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is a DA and does an acceptible job in the movie but Gerald ain't no dummy.<br /><br />The strategizing is really good and Gerard does one heck of a job in his role.(Nice Bod, too.)<br /><br />BUT--this is a brutal movie.  God only knows what the \\"uncut\\" version has that the one I watched didn't have, but I won't be finding out.  Please, do NOT let your children watch it.  If you buy it for yourself, watch it when they are not home and then lock it away somewhere.
B0035J6TAI|2.0|I've been a Gabriel fan since being turned on to Genesis in 1970. However, if I would have heard snippets of this CD I wouldn't have done a blind buy like most of all the other Gabriel CDs. CD is well produced and recorded, but after listening to it once I don't see myself listening to it again any time soon. Somebody else mentioned the lack of preview tracks here at Amazon. Now I think I know why. If you like one somber, brooding song after another, this is your disc.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I was delighted to purchase this addition to my collection of \\"Celtic Woman\\" CDs.  The price through Amazon.com was fantastic for a brand new CD, and it arrived in perfect shape in less than 2 days.  This isn't my first purchase from Amazon.com, and it won't be my last either!!
B0039A8QVI|5.0|WOW I never take the time to do this....BUT this the best Rookie country cd IMO.. well I think Garth in 1991
B000002LJW|5.0|If you like EC's guitar playing, there's a lot to like on this CD.  Great songs, great playing.  I suppose you can call it \\"pop\\".  I don't get into the labels so much, classifying what kind of music it is.  If it's good, I'll listen to it.  It's good.  The closing blues song \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" is worth the price of the CD alone, it's a real house rocker.    EC has gone through many incarnations in his life.  When he made Journeyman, he had a light of fire in his soul, and it shines through.  Crank up the speakers and enjoy!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this product. The packaging is nice, the product itself is even better, and thanks to Amazon I got free super-saver shipping. The sound quality of these CDs is great, and the artwork and inserts that accompany each album are very well done. The mini-documentary disc is nothing special, but that's not the reason anyone's buying this collection anyway. If you're a Beatles fan who's on the fence about buying this collection, buy it. You won't be disappointed. I was hesitant to repurchase a few of the CDs I had already owned (in the 1987 CD format), but was glad to hear significant improvements in the newly remastered versions. To put it simply, this is the way the Beatles were meant to be heard. If you love The Beatles, you will love this box set.

B000002H4C|5.0|After seeing the great \\"Major Boobage\\" episode in South Park's twelth season, with its cheesing and its very awesome music from the movie they parodied, Heavy Metal, I decided to purchase the soundtrack from which they used for their episode. Although it is not a heavy metal music, but more rock n' roll, it is still a great collection of songs that several groups have compiled into the movie. It can be listened either when you play as to pass time, or as you play the south park video game \\"Let's go Tower Defense\\". Not only that it has a great mix of various groups such as Don Felder, who composed the classic \\"Hotel California\\" and plays the excellent \\"Takin' A ride\\". Apart from that, I adored \\"Reach Out\\" by Cheap Trick and \\"True Companion\\" by Donald Fagen, even though I loved the whole album.<br /><br />A great buy for the movie fans, South Park, and also those who love listening to rock.
0061730327|5.0|THE BOY WHO HARNESSED THE WIND is definitely one of the most incredibly inspiring memoirs I have ever read.  It tells the fascinating story of William Kamkwamba, a poor farmer's son in Malawi, Africa, a country struggling with widespread poverty.  During a deadly 2002 drought and subsequent famine, life became a daily struggle to simply survive starvation.  After discovering a diagram of a windmill in an old library textbook, 14-year-old William armed with a vision and admirable determination, builds his own windmill using discarded scraps.  William's ingenious invention generates electricity for his home, which makes a profound difference in the lives of his family and the entire village.  Repeatedly, I was impressed by his ability to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.  Eventually, his remarkable achievement receives worldwide acclamation.    William (with co-writer Bryan Mealer) provides a compelling glimpse of the difficulties of his life that gave me a true sense of the harsh reality of poverty.  He enlightened me with his knowledge of Malawi's culture and politics.  As a science lover, I was enthralled by the steps William took in constructing his windmill!  I thoroughly enjoyed this awe-inspiring book.  It demonstrates how a dream, hope and dedication can change lives forever.  I strongly recommend it for everyone!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|We're so lucky someone had the foresight to tape these rehearsals, otherwise we would have had nothing.     The sound is terrific, the stage is second only in size and scope to Pink Floyd's stadium sets.This was truly an ambitious undertaking. MJ was using the largest 3-D screen in the world as his back drop. There was not a clunker song in the set. The musicians were incredible and so were the dancers and all the crew.     The songs we've heard before; his hits. MJ doesn't like to vary too much from the album versions but the musicians are allowed to embellish it a little and the songs truly sound fresh and vigorous.    MJ's moves are super natural. He was a god of entertainment, a most fully realized performer.    He got down.The band rocked. He's the funk master. He's hypnotic and mesmerizing to watch...crank this up on a good sound system and be prepared to be swept away.    Everybody else is just sloppy seconds. He was The Man!    If all you've ever seen of MJ are his music videos then you need to see this. I'm a musician and believe it or not was never too impressed with his music videos since they have to be lip-synched and you can stop and start the filming and edit out mistakes.    I truly became a fan of Michael when I saw him perform live in 2001 at the Madison Square Garden 30th anniversary of his solo career show. That was live so I could tell that he can really move like that and it's not just video magic.    This show is live rehearsal and they are pretty much ready to go. They are just fine tuning so you get to see the band and MJ in excellent form.    He does the robot dance, does a dance where it looks like he's driving a car.. He moves like liquid lightning.     Every song was a universe on to itself    During the song \\"Human Nature\\" he does these really squirrely moves that didn't seem to make sense to me at all but then all of sudden he kicks into this high note and it all makes sense...Wow!     He was on and he was ready to go but fate had other plans    Like Elvis before him Michael did it his way    The film actually shows the musicians playing behind Michael which I like so you know it's not a tape and they aren't lip-synching.    Michael grew up in the day when you really had to know how to sing and play an instrument.    The producers of this movie should have released the live songs from this performance on a CD. Instead they chose to rerelease the studio versions of the songs which everybody has already heard on CD.    The dance routines are stunning...what an artist!    You have to see it to believe it    He was truly in a different league    You have Michael and then there is everybody else    We love you MJ.
B0030V0PEW|2.0|The information content in this book is abysmally low.  Basically reiterates the same point over and over again, with a lot of medical (and aviation/construction) related examples.  A one page summary of the book would more than suffice.  I kept going, hoping the author would have more to say, and then found myself at the end of the book.  I am still surprised this book got published with so very little to say:    Use checklists, they work.    Use checklists, our jobs are too complex to keep it all in our heads.    Use checklists, the age of the master builder is behind us.  Use checklists, hospitals who use them have a better success rate.  Use checklists, aviation industry uses them with amazing results.  Use checklists, construction industry uses them with amazing results.    I was completely fooled by all  the 5 star reviews.  This book is the anti-thesis of a page turner.
B001ER4CTI|5.0|Very fast delivery. Incredible extras. Bought the basic DVD sometime ago. Heard about this and had to have it. Great addition. Thanx Amazon!
B002N1AERI|5.0|I admit, I am a new fan to Epica. I have been meaning to check out their music but never got to it until now. I bought the band's newest album Design Your Universe a few weeks ago. While Design Your Universe isn't quite as good as Elis's latest album Catharsis, I still enjoy it immensely. I really enjoy listening to Simone's vocals and the background vocals by the band's choir. Everyone's vocals meshes well with the aggressive guitar riffs and the pounding drums. My quibble with the album is the frequent guitar solos which I find rather monotonous. I also think some of the songs tend to sound alike, and I am well past being tired of that mix of angelic female vocals with the cookie monster on acid male vocals. That recipe has worn out its welcome. Asides from those flaws, the album is both melodic and aggressive to my liking. My favorite song on the album has to be the ballad \\"Tides of Time\\". The melodies on that particular song is stuck in my head. While Design Your Universe is not completely flawless it certainly has made me a fan. I definitely plan on checking out the band's other albums in the future.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|At first I thought this was a practical joke but alas it was not April Fool's Day.  Then - I seriously considered that some investors lost a bet and as the loser had to fund this movie.  I am not quite sure about that either.  What I do know is that this is possibly the WORST MOVIE IN MANKIND!  Honest to God, it was THAT BAD.  I almost feel bad for the director - but he/she knew what they were getting into.  And the classic ending that leaves us with a soft rock ballad PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND - after 99.9% OF MANKIND IS DESTROYED!!!!! I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP!  Do yourself a favor and spend your time on something other than this movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|THIS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST INFORMATIVE DVD'S I HAVE EVER SEEN.  EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT SHOULD BE TELEVISED.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is an excellent CD overall. This is my first and so far only exposure to Porcupine Tree, and I am very impressed. They remind me of other bands in some ways, but are also completely unique.  They are like...    ...Pink Floyd, but with a more contemporary sound    ...Rush, but with more dynamic range    ...Dream Theater, but more artistic    ...Greenday, but more creative and progressive    ...Tool, but a lot cleaner (in several ways)    Now I hope PT fans will forgive these comparisons. I do not in any way mean that PT is somehow mimicking or copying these bands. If I had heard PT first, I could have easily made comparisons the other direction (eg. Dream Theater is like Porcupine Tree, only more technical).    This album is highly listenable, while still being intricate and dynamic. It also has the best string of 5 songs I've heard from any band in a long time (tracks 1-5), and that's saying something.    The songs:  DEADWING: Excellent opener - creative, edgy, and just catchy enough. Good progressive piece.  SHALLOW: Has a \\"single\\" feel to it. Very driving, great riffs, and, along with Halo, the heaviest song on the disc. Easy to get attached to.  LAZARUS: The most beautiful song on the album. A slow number that is absolutely beautiful.  HALO: Another driving, edgy song, more progressive than SHALLOW.  ARRIVING SOMEWHERE: The pinnacle of the album. A 12+ minute track that builds from a very simple guitar and vocal melody with increasing power and intensity before pulling back again. I can't get enough of this song.  MELLOTRON SCRATCH: The only song I don't like. Too slow, and frankly, dull. About 3/4 of the way through, it suddenly starts to get interesting, but then it ends.  OPEN CAR: Another edgy song with a lot of emotion to it.  START OF SOMETHING: Another good progressive piece that alternates between intense and mellow moments. Great bass on this song.   GLASS ARM: Another slow number. Similar to, but more interesting than MELLOTRON. At the same time, not as beautiful as LAZARUS.    The first 5 tracks are all top-tier songs in my book. MELLOTRON is the only really weak song on the album, and then the next three songs are really good second-tier numbers. The bonus track would rank in the same second-tier category.    A thematic thread of death and spirituality links all the songs into a cohesive album, yet musically, each song has a unique sound.    A note on the packaging: The 16 page CD booklet includes almost no lyrics (a few \\"handwritten\\" lyrics grace the artwork, but the lion's share of the lyrics are not available). It kinda sucks having to go to the internet to read along with the songs.    Overall, a great album, and a really enjoyable introduction to Porcupine Tree.  Full 5 stars.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|Chinatown is a dark bit of neo-noir cinema directed by the great Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and starring three time Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson (both of whom are no strangers to dark stories).  So to say that Chinatown is a journey into the darkside of humanity is putting this gloomy story lightly.  Everything about this movie has a lingering feel to it that refuses to leave a viewer's head.  Is it the characters or the plot?  It's both.  Chinatown is a mystifying puzzle of a film that immerses its viewers into its world.<br /><br />Chinatown is not a nice film, being in no way your typical Hollywood picture.  I could really feel how this film was made during the Vietnam War because everything about it is very cynical to say the least.  The characters are hateful and are constantly following questionable and deplorable morals in order to finish their jobs.  In a normal Hollywood picture a man like Jake might be looked down upon, but in Chinatown the other characters are so cruel that the stubborn detective becomes an enormously charismatic lead.  He's sarcastic as well as a scoundrel, but that's Jake's charm.  He likes to put things bluntly in an often *dark* comical light.  Jake can be beat down, sliced up, and shot at yet will keep on going in search of the truth.  It's a determination that can't be healthy for the character, but admirable nonetheless.  How he keeps such good humor about the events is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best I've seen out of him (and that's saying something) truly embodying J. J. \\"Jake\\" Gittes; I really believed that this character could be for real.  Jake Gittes will bring you into Chinatown with a fast tongue and scathing sarcasm.<br /><br />With such a bleak film it's almost hard to believe it can be such a beloved classic, yet here it remains as one of the greatest films of all time.  But why is this?  People always seem to look for happy endings; a quick fix that wraps the story up in a tidy little package.  While some may view Chinatown's ending as a flaw it is in actuality one of the things that makes it a stand out movie.<br /><br />The sad, quite frankly, tragic ending is one that lingered in my mind (and I'm sure those of everyone else who saw it) long after it had ended.  Chinatown isn't meant to please its viewer.  It succeeds because it challenges the viewer to look into the dark reality of life while also questioning what the characters in the film might have done differently.  A tale of murder, dumping water and incest might not be good for a mainstream audience, but for viewers who want a movie that stimulates all their senses there are few better than Roman Polanski's Chinatown.<br /><br />A great director brings his or her vision to screen without compromise.  Polanski does this without flaw.little package.  While some may view Chinatown's ending as a flaw it is in actuality one of the things that makes it a stand out movie.

B00003CX9E|5.0|In 1941 actor/director/writer Orson Welles would release one of the most cherished films to ever hit the silver screen.  Many have cited it as the greatest film of all time, and many more agree that Citizen Kane is the quintessential American movie.  Like all great films it transcends traditional narrative to become something all its own.  The movie almost holds a surreal feel as audiences are thrust into the luxurious, yet lonely life of Charles Foster Kane.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a great looking film, no question about it.  It's obvious that the sets are fake but the movie uses that to its full advantage.  Each of these sets is so exaggerated and ornate that it allows the film to transcend generations.  It's a kind of timeless quality that is rarely seen in contemporary pieces.  What looked good in this film upon its release still looks good to this day because it is an exaggeration of the American culture, which when someone really thinks about it, hasn't changed much since the time of Citizen Kane's release.<br /><br />Even more important to Citizen Kane's set designs are the lighting mixed with expert photography.  Lighting of Kane becomes the most crucial aspect of discerning his character and foreshadowing his path.  Though the dialogue is often brilliant, Citizen Kane seems to have been made with solely the visuals in mind, because it is clear that the story of Kane's rise and fall can be told through the powerful imagery presented throughout the movie.<br /><br />From being the \\"voice of the people\\" through the use of his newspaper (The Inquirer) to giving off the ferocious political campaign speeches clearly inspired by Adolf Hitler, the scope of Citizen Kane never seems to back down in its uncompromising character-study of a man who could never back down.  As the viewer follows his path towards self-destruction they realize that this character is not unlike many who still inhabit the country to this very day.  When they look at Orson Welles as Kane they can see the type of person everyone knows all too well.  Everyone knows about someone who will do anything for love, only to discover he's done all the wrong things.  Kane fails in life because he never learns that an emotion such as love can never be bought.  Gratitude can be bought, or appreciation, but love requires something beyond the material realm of personal interaction.  All these emotional issues are brought to focus by the film's outstanding scope, which is far ahead of its time.<br /><br />What else stands out about this film?  Everyone cites the lighting, directing, and sets, but also one needs to keep in mind: Orson Welles' acting is extraordinary.  He can be funny, tragic, compelling, charismatic, and many scenes he is in make-up in order to play Kane through the decades.  Surely it is one of the greatest performances ever captured on the silver screen.<br /><br />So, is Citizen Kane the \\"greatest movie ever made\\"?  Without much hesitation the answer is yes.  Maybe it isn't at times the most entertaining film ever made, but it clearly has the merits that make it worth seeing again and again.  This film looks great, its story is full of loose-ends for the audience to solve for themselves, but most important of all is how well the film has aged.  There are not many, if any complaints to be had in regards to Orson Welles cinematic landmark.<br /><br />Citizen Kane remains the undisputed champion of American cinema...<br /><br />But how is the DVD?  Well, in short: the two-disc special edition is a great restoration of this film and includes a great deal of special features.  The best of these features is a feature length commentary by infamous film critic Roger Ebert and the other being the documentary \\"The Battle for Citizen Kane\\" which is a great overview of the conflict between Orson Welles and communications tycoon William Hearst.<br /><br />If you truly love movies you'd be a fool not to have this landmark film as a part of your collection.pe of person everyone knows all too well.

0618918248|2.0|I have no problem with the science of professor Dawkins in his book The God Delusion but lets just say I am skeptical of his views on God and religion. The following points out just three of several errors that I find in his book. 1-The opening quote is witty but not wise. To paraphrase, as I don't remember the quote exactly, \\"Every one is an atheist regarding all the Gods that came before the one they worship, some just go one God more\\" seems to miss the point the our understanding of God can evolve as much as species can evolve. As a scientist one would think he might get the concept of progress. 2-He claims that he does not need to read theology to comment on God it appears that theologists are beneath his contempt. The problem is that he then completely mangles Roman Catholic theology on the trinity, Mary and the communion of saints. At the end of his book he then shoots himself in the foot. He seems to be trying to convince me of science as god and quotes a quantum physicist \\"If you think you understand quantum physics, then you don't understand quantum physics\\". Well if you think you understand God then you don't understand God. HIs book is written from a closed perspective and allows no value to those with a different perspective.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|The box is reminiscent of something Hitchcock would write. The settings and effects were well done, but the casting was a tad weak. You push a button and someone unconnected to you dies, plus you make a million in the process. Though it is all about testing the morals of mankind, everyone seems to overlook that the test was rigged. The tuition discount and the nasa test were squashed before this golden opportunity was handed to them. People under stress will put themselves before a stranger. I truly enjoyed the plot and the pure irony of the ending.

055380684X|4.0|With its inspiring dust jacket message -- \\"Greatness isn't born. It's grown. Here's how.\\" -- Coyle's book rounds out the egalitarian excellence trilogy, taking a refreshing new slant on ground already covered by Geoff Colvin (\\"Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World Class Performers from Everybody Else\\") and Malcolm Gladwell (\\"Outliers: The Story of Success\\").<br /><br />Colvin's basic message from \\"Talent is Overrated\\" is as follows: Greatness comes from something called deep practice, which amounts to working your butt off and enduring insane doses of psychological pain (because deep practice is hard and taxing and it hurts).<br /><br />Gladwell's message from \\"Outliers\\" was even more succinct (or clich&eacute;d, depending on one's point of view): All greatness pretty much boils down to the 10,000 hour rule. If you want to be world class at something, put 10,000 hours into it. Period. Child prodigies like Mozart, we are told, merely got a head start on this onerous requirement.<br /><br />Daniel Coyle puts a uniquely scientific spin on the pursuit of excellence, focusing on the neuro-physical essence of skill formation and boiling it down to a strange waxy substance called myelin.<br /><br />\\"We are myelin beings,\\" Coyle intones with a sort of mystic reverence. Myelin is the speed-enhancing stuff that wraps the signal-generating nerve fibers in our brains, turning slow, sluggish 56K modem connections into the mental equivalent of fiber-optic cables.<br /><br />\\"Skill is a cellular insulation [i.e. myelin] that wraps neural circuits,\\" Coyle writes, \\"and that grows in response to certain signals.\\"<br /><br />With this wonky definition in tow, Coyle travels the world in search of \\"Chicken-wire Harvards\\" -- hotbeds of excellence where unlikely concentrations of talent spring up, usually in sparse surroundings. His examples range from Brazilian soccer players to Curacao baseball kids to cello players in upstate New York.<br /><br />At a fairly compact 220 pages (give or take), the book is organized into three main sections: Deep Practice, Ignition, and Master Coaching.<br /><br />\\"Deep Practice\\" is all about the means of \\"earning myelin,\\" i.e. building skill, as effectively and rapidly as possible. The essence of deep practice is a sort of intensely focused start-stop observation and experimentation, in which the practitioner is constantly making mistakes and looking to correct them one by one. It is not so much about speed as relentless repetition in the pursuit of small, incremental improvements... pushing the edge of the envelope inch by relentless inch. There is even a universal facial expression: As Coyle describes it, deep practicing kids all over the world bear uncanny resemblance to a squinty-eyed Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The section on \\"Ignition\\" is all about the critical factor of motivation -- the source of passion and desire that keeps the fire burning. Without ignition, i.e. the presence of that constant burning fire, the energy and mental drive to continue on in the grueling path of deep practice is not there.<br /><br />\\"Master Coaching\\" focuses on the methods of top instructors and teachers -- the older, wiser souls who are great at helping others become great. Surprisingly, the profile of the master coach is not so much aggressive and enthusiastic as focused, personalized and low key. Coyle's investigation reveals the perhaps surprising truth that master coaching, in its essence, is far more cerebral than emotional. There is indeed an emotional component to it, but the emotion is strategic and applied with calculated purpose. Everything the master coach does, down to the slightest interaction, is meant to maximize skill transfer. In a way it comes down to a sort of brute force mathematics: The greater the number of meaningful small adjustments a coach can pack into a tight time space, the faster the student learns (and thus the faster the myelin forms). This idea of coach as rapid-fire iteration machine is eye opening.<br /><br />As for personal takeaways, Coyle's book has inspired me to take even more deliberate strides towards excellence -- to sort of hire myself on as my own Master Coach. The practical application of this involves more routinely stepping outside myself... evaluating a performance or a piece of work from a distance... recording detailed critiques in a journal or personal recorder... and looking for as many rapid-fire points of incremental improvement as possible before moving on to the next project.<br /><br />The book's payoff was greater than just that, though, in fostering more commitment to learning processes I had already embraced intuitively. I was delighted to discover the concept of \\"automaticity,\\" for example, as this term (which I had not heard before, in spite of having read a number of brain books) synched up with a phrase of my own invention. Automation and Documentation, or \\"autodoc,\\" is the self-styled terminology I had previously used to describe the process of articulating and unpacking information into the subconscious mind, such that commonly executed skill routines gradually become automatic. I did not realize there was already a term in the field for this.<br /><br />One question \\"The Talent Code\\" brings to mind is this: What does it mean for the human race now that we are getting so much better at skill development, i.e. figuring out what deep practice really is (and how to do it)? Are we going to see more prodigies, and ever greater levels of achievement, now that a new generation of kids -- and more importantly their doting parents -- are getting a clearer sense of where \\"talent\\" actually comes from and what it's really all about?<br /><br />On the one hand, you have inspiring books like this one, complete with the egalitarian excellence battle cry and the nascent promise of rapidly spreading competence. We are finally learning to maximize human potential, huzzah! On the other hand you have all these laments -- which seem to be growing at about the same rate as video game popularity -- about how the mind is being destroyed by Xbox and Playstation, mindless Google and Youtube searches, Facebook friends and Twitter feeds, cell phone texts and so on... all these never-ending distractions that are turning our collective brains into ooze.<br /><br />As the \\"Talent Code\\" revolution takes hold of a motivated minority -- while passing the majority by -- could we be headed into a society with an even greater divide between haves and have nots than before? A world where talent-enabled kids find themselves even more advantaged than before, competing against a mass of bogged down lumpen content to sink into the pleasant quicksand of sugary information stimuli?

0307271862|4.0|On page 328 of THE MAN FROM BEIJING, Henning Mankell writes, as part of a conversation, \\"We are still embroiled in a large-scale investigation with lots of complicated details.\\" This pretty much describes the book. It starts with the murders of 18 elderly people and 1 child in a hamlet in Sweden in 2006. By the time the story ends, the reader has been to China in 1863, Nevada during the building of the transcontinental railroad, back to China still in the 19th century but then slips into 2006, back to modern day Sweden, then back to China, and, finally, returning to Sweden after a momentous sidetrip to Africa and a significant pause in London.<br /><br />Mankell writes so well that the reader can actually keep all of this straight. When all is said and done, THE MAN FROM BEIJING is not about international travel or politics (although Mankell writes reams about the politics and economics of China). It is about two families and the collision of their lives in 19th century Nevada. Two brothers from China, San and Guo Si, are worked mercilessly by the Swedish supervisor of their crew, Jan August Andren. When San returns to China he begins to write every detail of his life. He doesn't know if he will ever have someone in his family who will want to read it but he continues his task for the rest of his life.<br /><br />In Sweden, Birgitta Roslin, a judge, learns that she is related to the Andren family, brutally killed in their homes. Birgitta is drawn to the murder scene and, as a judge, is given considerable latitude at the crime scene. In the house, she finds an old journal written by JA Andren and outside, in the snow, she finds a red ribbon. Birgitta chooses to eat in a Chinese restaurant and she notices that the red ribbon hanging from a lantern over her table is an exact match to the ribbon from the crime scene. In fact, a red ribbon is missing from a lantern over another table.<br /><br />In present day China, Ya Ru, highly successful and a major player in moving China to capitalism, has been studying the journal of his ancestor, San. Thus begins the dueling recollections of the ancestors and, assisted by an inordinate number of coincidences, Birgitta and Ya Ru move toward a confrontation.<br /><br />This is not a Wallender book. It is entertaining and worth reading as long as the reader doesn't expect everything to make sense. Sometimes, major issues are resolved so smoothly that I almost missed them. Mankell offers up plenty of information about the characters but I didn't find myself caring very much about any of them. Birgitta is the main character but Hong Qiu, an important figure in China, is more interesting.<br /><br />Read and enjoy the book for what it is, an quick and somewhat engrossing stand-alone by Henning Mankell. Mankell is always a great writer. But don't expect this to be on the same level as the Kurt Wallender series.been studying the journal of his ancestor, San.

0307588335|5.0|A tour de force book exposing the grand daddy of all bubbles.  The book is more than the isolation and incompetence at the very throne of Wall Street investment banks that burned out like a comet.  \\"A Colossal Failure\\" goes well beyond the biggest bankruptcy case in US history.  As a journey, from the author's childhood, we follow the human story of an individual determined to fulfill his goals--his \\"American Dream\\"--to rise to the top of the US financial market.  Little did he know, or any other American living in the boom times of the past decade, that he would reach the mountaintop of his life long dream.  But that mountain was a volcano about to erupt with the lava flows of greed, power and arrogance of a few ruining and ruling over the destruction of a fabled, century-and-a-half year-old company.  Highly recommend to read the rise and fall of this startling and revealing book.

B002QGUFWE|4.0|Lady Gaga is fast becoming a household name.  This musical diva is on the radio non-stop and everyone cannot seem to get enough of her.  She is an eye-catching, glam rock character than engages us and the public is enthralled.  Yet, who is she? With her outrageous fashion statements, many wigs and sunglasses, we are a little confused on how she came to be.  Was their a girl before the Gaga?  In fact, to grasp any concept about her music or her persona, it is necessary to know her roots.  She was born in 1986 as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta before taking on her stage name \\"Lady Gaga\\".  She grew up in New York City and was trained in piano and songwriting.  She went to NYU's prestigious Tisch School of the Art's and continued to dedicatedly hone her musical skills.  Yet she was a nobody, an Italian brunette with no real prospects, she was ordinary, until she was discovered by top-music executives and Lady Gaga appeared.              In December 2009, Gaga released \\"The Fame Monster: Deluxe Edition\\" that includes her first album \\"The Fame\\" with the eight songs released on the album \\"The Fame Monster\\".  This album gives a greater understanding of her musical style.  It includes top songs such as \\"Bad Romance, Telephone, Paparazzi, Lovegame, and Poker Face\\".  Gaga describes \\"The Fame Monster\\" as a result of her fast thrust into the public eye and each song depicts a dark side of fame.      In \\"Bad Romance\\" the song starts out with a very catchy chant like \\"Rah, Rah, Oh La La\\" that has propelled this song into one that you can never get out of your ear!  The first verse is \\"I want your ugly. I want your disease. I want your everything. As long as it's free. I want your love\\".  It embodies this addition to love and romance, even when it is detrimental.  This is a concept that everyone struggles to overcome, the need to feel loved and be in right relationships with one another.  In this song, Gaga is okay with the abuse if it allows her to be loved.  In the song \\"Paparazzi\\" she sings how she would follow a boy until he finally loves her.  However, this is not the situation we are to be in, it is never okay to be abused for love.  It stems from a self-destructive behavior.  As a twenty-something myself, it is easy to point out multiple self-destructive and parasitic habits and this desire and addition to them.  It is a desire for the world and it will never satisfy our needs.  Yet with a catchy tune, we can candy coat this misery.          When I listen to this album I reflect on the question: \\"Why do we love Gaga?  What is the draw?\\"  I believe in her character of mystery and the mask that she wears it allows us to appeal to the darker side of our desires.  She is part of the rave scene and it is easy to get lost in the sound of the beat without thinking of the consequences.  To twenty-something New Yorkers she is the epitome of the dis-raveled chain smoker girl that wears black eyeliner and lives in the city and drinks at the clubs.  These are all girls that are truly seeking for truth, love, hope, and substance yet in a lifestyle that will never find them, despite how glamorous it may seem.  However, this is a group that we must understand to love.  They are my friends, colleges and neighbors on Long Island and to reach them I need to understand their context.        I believe that is why I am so intrigued by Lady Gaga and her music.  She is a girl that I feel I know and have sat next to at community college over the summer.  She is talented and creative yet trapped in this world of unhealthy behaviors that stem from insecurity and a lack of the knowledge of a truly loving God.  Lady Gaga is \\"cool\\" in all senses of the word; she is ahead of the times and pushing the envelope in her music, tour and fashion.  She is a true performance artist and I can respect that as a musician.    As the musical guest on Saturday Night Live last year, Gaga performed her regular techno-electric songs and then sat down at the piano and showed usher real musical talent.  It was the turning point when I looked at her as a real musician and had an intimate view of this character instead of brushing her off as \\"another tramp pop artist who will fade\\".  While her lyrics and song themes are not always something I might condone, there is a realness about her that allows us to explore our own \\"monsters\\" in our lives.

And no consumer processor from AMD or Intel runs at a stock speed of 4000MHZ. 4000 Megahertz is 4 Gigahertz and only by extreme overclocking by enthusiasts does any processor run at 4 Ghz. If a person can be this far off about their product, are you sure you want to buy from them? You had better know what you are doing if you buy from Tigerdirect.

B002WY65VU|2.0|The movie starts evocatively with \\"Columbus\\" (Jesse Eisenberg) providing rules for surviving zombies.  This initial smart, knowing comedy is not sustained because the pacing is much too slow--the zombie encounters are far too few and too brief, and you are likely to have already seen all the good ones in the trailers.  There is no tension or sense of peril.<br /><br />There are actually two distinct movies here. The first warrants 4 stars (after a 5-star start).  The second begins with Chapter 16 (at 47 minutes) when they arrive in Hollywood.  What had been clever, wary, even paranoid, characters become stupid, oblivious, even self-destructive, not only abandoning even basic precautions but advertising their presence, and thereby inviting the zombie hordes to attack them.  I don't think this was an intentional comment on Hollywood, but rather a lazy way to set up a brainless, boring, trite, formulaic Hollywood ending.<br /><br />Aside: In a departure from most zombie movies, the zombies here manage to keep the electrical power grid fully operational, although they still can't operate any other equipment. :-)

Tally(She is the main character) can't wait to turn sixteen and get her operation to turn pretty so she doesn't have to live in Uglyville anymore. However, her friend, Shay doesn't want to change how she looks, so she wants to run away to a secret town called \\"The Smoke\\" where nobody has to feel bad about themselves if they aren't pretty. When Tally refuses to come with her, Shay gives her a poem to read and solve the secret message in it that shows how to go to the Smoke if Tally somehow changes her mind. The people who give the operations; called Specials, won't let Tally have her operation until she finds Shay because they don't want runaways. Tally goes on a big adventure to find Shay, and you'll never believe what happens next! The beginning  was confusing for me since I didn't know this story  took place in the future. There were a lot of exciting surprises that you would never think could happen. I expected a lot from this book, and it was better than that! I would also reccomend the book ,Pretties, which comes after Uglies, because I really enjoyed Uglies. I didn't pay for this book since I read it in class, but even if I did pay for it, I would feel that it would be worth it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|After I read some discussions on this documentary and saw partial video segments, I decided I might like to own this DVD.  I don't usually buy too many DVD's because after watching them, they sit and collect dust.  Not this one.....I plan on watching it again with friends and I think it should be shown in classrooms and students need to be aware of what we are eating.  The parents are not giving them the information they need.  Very well done documentary and in my opinion, it could have been much longer with even more information.  I hoping there a part II coming out![[ASIN:B0027BOL4G Food, Inc.]]
B001OQCV2O|5.0|good imagination of the writters and directors of this film.  saw it in theaters and believe this movie belongs in the science fiction thiller.  the last polar shift happened 8 million years ago and toke 1 million years to happen.    loved the effert and special effects but believe the chaos theory over this story line.  the blu ray experience is the only way to go for this movie.  you will get your moneys worth.

B002HREKCI|3.0|I had read all the rave reviews of this book. That's why I bought it. So maybe my exceptions were too high. I don't know the reason for sure but I really don't have anything to rave about. I thought this book was only okay.<br /><br />So what made me think that it was only okay? I didn't connect with these characters at all. I felt no sympathy for Hannah or Clay. To me it seemed like most of the problems Hannah had were brought on by herself. Maybe inadvertently but she was definitely partly to blame.<br />Clay's feeling for Hannah were not that believable to me. How can a boy like a girl for so long and not act on it? I know it happens but there were times when Clay had a perfect opportunity. He even knew that she liked him!<br /><br />Oh well...I don't want to rant. The book wasn't all bad. The concept of the story was great. I just couldn't get past the characters.
6305882592|5.0|Fans of this movie will want to check out the trailers that are included on the DVD, as they utilize different takes than those in the film, and show added scenes... most notably some of Harold and Maude making out.  These weren't made special for the DVD; they're the original Coming Attractions, as seen in a theatre near you.
0380778556|2.0|This book is full of unrealistic people and situations. For a start, the young woman narrator is never named. It is puzzling that no one ever calls her by her first name. In the beginning of the story she is employed by a rich American woman to speak to party guests and light their cigarettes. As she is shy and awkward in social situations, it's hard to imagine her in this role. For much of the book the woman and Maxim relate at a superficial level. There is not the close personal relationship you would expect between lovers. You have to wonder why Maxim did not divorce Rebecca instead of  taking the drastic step of murder. This is most unrealistic. It is hinted that Mrs Danvers, the housekeeper who liked Rebecca, burns down the house Manderley at the end of the book. Maxim and his wife move to a hotel on a Mediterranean island. How come  no insurance? The land must have been very valuable as well. There was no reason to leave England. It's unrealistic that a rather pathetic person like Rebecca would have  influence from the grave. Possibly Daphne du Maurier wrote this book with her tongue in her cheek. With the house called Manderley she obviously had to get in the phrase \\"on the road to Manderley,\\" which she does, near the very end. Maybe this book is actually a spoof of  low brow, badly written melodrama.

We like to play it better with 2 people just because when we play with 3 of us, my 5-year old doesn't quite catch why he can't lay his piece where he wants.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|This is by far one of the best films within the genre that I`ve ever seen:-)The story doesn`t have that much new to say, but the performances and production values are excellent indeed. Well.... the snow when they first visit Esther is really not that real - coming from Norway and looking out of the window - I should know.<br /><br />Vera Farmiga and the three children all turn in performances of Oscar-material....  The curtian with Jimmy Durante crooning is a good close....<br /><br />This film will be a repeated joy to see:-)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie should be watched by everyone!  I am continually amazed at what our country allows to go on at the detrament of our people.  Here is a big reason we have such a problem with our health and health care.  Also, I would strongly suggest they watch the special features on this DVD.  The people of America need to make a difference and do our part by making wise choices when we shop, vote etc.  Our voices are the only way things will change.  The government and the FDA are bought out by big business! I have purchased several copies of this movie to share with others and I hope more people will do the same!
B000HFBQPG|3.0|I found the the book to be suprisingly \\"honest\\". There was nothing that seemed to be edited in ,so to speak, just so the reader will start on the next chapter asap. No glitz or glamour. i believed it to be a very realistic sounding adolecent/pre-rock god life. But, this was also the down side. No glitz or glamour to entertain... kind of menoutenous at times. But I always found myself looking forward to the next chapter the next day. I appreciated the honestly in the end though. I would DEFINATLY recommed this book to \\"fans\\" but not to the \\"just curious\\" reader. I found my entertainment from the fatuation with the man to begin with.

0316017922|2.0|Malcom Gladwell made his name with a series of New Yorker articles and books that purported to show surprising ways in which the world world, and unseen principles that guided it. While Gladwell is a very skilled writer, he has large gaps in his education when it comes to science, economics, biology, history, anthropology... well, everything except writing. The result is that his books are a combination of what Gladwell has gleaned in speaking with specialists combined with his own instincts, and his instincts do not serve him very well.<br /><br />At best, his books are an interesting read that climaxes in what amounts to a very shallow and obvious insight. Case in point, Outliers, the volume under review. After presenting numerous interesting histories of successful people, Gladwell presents us with the following lightning bolt: To be successful, it helps to have opportunities to succeed available to you. Put that way, it doesn't quite have the snap of Gladwell's prose, but that's what he's saying.<br /><br />Problem is, even then Gladwell misses the fact that a lot of very successful people did not have opportunities easily available to them, and succeeded nonetheless.Thomas Edison was one of the most successful entrepreneurs in American history, and he didn't have very many lucky breaks. He was self-educated, partially deaf, and financed his early inventions as a peddler on a train.  Henry Ford was involved in two automobile companies that failed before he struck success with his namesake company. Some succeeded multiple times; were they just that much luckier?<br /><br />And even those who appeared to have been presented with a great opportunity, like Bill Gates, who was ready when IBM came calling, are misleading, because we don't know what would have become of Gates had IBM not come calling. Perhaps he would have made billions writing software, or creating a new financial company. Working backwards from the present, it's easy to to convince yourself that the outcome of an event was destined; working forward from the present, with an infinite number of possibilities open to you, it's not so clear.<br /><br />At best, Gladwell manages to demonstrate that some successful people benefited by having opportunities available to them. But what he misses is something that's at the heart of a well known quote of Louis Pasteur's: Chance favors the prepared. Each of us may well be presented with a thousand opportunities in our lifetime like that which Bill Gates had with IBM; few of us are prepared to recognize them when they occur. And fewer still have the drive to take advantage of them.outcome of an event was destined; working forward from the present, with an infinite number of possibilities open to you, it's not so clear.<br /><br />At best, Gladwell manages to demonstrate that some successful people benefited by having opportunities available to them.

B002GSXKN8|3.0|I bought this product since having the first 4 films that were produced for Batman, was a good idea. To be honest, the second and third movies are my fave on this box set, the first one is ok but is not the best. And the last one, is a very bad movie, batman and robin is the worst movie on the Batman Movie Saga. It is unbeliavable that the movie was directed by Joel S. which was present on the third film which is the best for these set of movies, but of course since Tim Burton was involved on Batman forever probably that was Joel S looked good on the production of the third movie
B00127RAJY|4.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this DVD. It has three levels so you can advance when you want and is only about 20 minutes of work out time. I used it about three times a week and lost 6.3 pounds and 6 inches total in one month from level one alone; I probably could have lost more if I had a better diet plan and did it every day but thats another review :). Anyway, I really recommend this DVD for those who work out at home and cant spend an hour or more daily in the gym. I work two jobs and attend school full time so my work outs are usually around 5am (when I don't hit the snooze button). This DVD fit perfectly into my schedule.

B000ZELISO|3.0|This franchise is one of the few that can safely refute the old adage that sequels are never as good as the original.  Indeed, it's something of an amazement how the Potter franchise has managed to maintain such quality of filmmaking after so many sequels.  I think that's why interest is still so high for these films after so many years and probably why the final book is being split into 2 films, to milk it for all they can - not to imply the story isn't worth it; I'm glad their are two more films to look forward to rather than just one.  But, as with most of the other larger book translations (eg. Goblet of Fire) there was a lot of interesting moments cut from the film rendition that we can only hope may someday be restored in the eventual ultimate BD editions ala the first two films (assuming they were actually shot).<br /><br />As is, the sixth film in the Potter franchise plays more like a filler to build anticipation for the final installments, than a self-contained story with a unique and notable purpose of its own.  The series has become progressively darker and more mature with each installment and this is no exception.  Gone is much of the innocense and naive wonder that built this esoteric cobblestone world.  But for those of us so enthralled, seeing it visually imagined as capably, dare I say, brilliantly, can be reward enough (assuming the final chapters make up for the story that this one lacks) even if there is little payoff in the end.<br /><br />As for the BD, I think Warner's authoring has gradually improved over the past couple of years.  The days of their masters being biased for the limitations of the DVD format seems to be drifting further and further behind - at least for new release titles.  Most of their catalog HD offerings still tend to be a little lacking in detail - often more than a little.  But with films that have been recently mastered like this one, there's little reason to complain, based on 1080p/24 projection onto a 100\\" screen (smaller displays will no doubt be more foregiving, just as larger projected images could magnify problems I didn't notice or at least didn't find too cumbersome).maller displays will no doubt be more foregiving, just as larger projected images could magnify problems I didn't notice or at least didn't find too cumbersome).

B000002MI4|5.0|I could tell the second I heard about this album I'd probably have a difficult time reviewing it once I listened to it. The reason for that is because I am not classically trained in music. Know a little about it here and can easily recognize it's influence in other music. It's the same thing that sometimes happenes with certain types of jazz-lack of familiarity makes it a big chore for me to review them. One thing I do know is that it's a lot easier in many ways to integrate classical influences into rock or R&B than to integrate R&B and rock into classical. Classical by definition is a musical form very much carved in stone and it's always treading water when your trying to mix them,especially if your an untrained musician. Of course [[ASIN:B000002RSK Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio]] comes to mind and it's only fitting he and Elvis were actually collaborating on music between both of their respective albums several short years before this and,roughly around the same time they were seperately pursuing the same concept:an untrained rock musician,although both great composers nontheless who were looking to make a classical album. Now in that context I can say this is an excellent album. And one of the reasons is because,even though this music mixes vocal pieces and instrumentals both featuring the Brodsky String Quartet the music basically sounds like Costello's fairly typical melodic style classically influenced pop compositions played with a classical quartet. So he's not going too far against his grain here. As a matter of fact the compositions,which play out like something of an opera while working as seperate pieces really reveal how strong \\"Swine\\",'Jacksons,Monk And Rowe\\",\\"Dear Sweet Filthy World\\" and \\"For Your Eyes\\" are strictly as Elvis Costello compositions alone,nevermind their classical style here. Not only that but you'll find that instrumental compositions such as the intro \\"Deliver Us\\" and \\"The First To Leave\\" showcase how strong his compositions are in this context without vocals. Unlike other pop artists \\"going classical\\" Elvis Costello,perhaps because of his families jazz backround which is a strong link to classical was able to succeed both melodically and lyrically with this style. Now I would'nt say it would've been wise for him to adopt this is a complete music style for him but it's more than worth it considering he was more or less just giving it a try.re in this context without vocals.

With nothing else to do, Greg says this is how he wants to spend his summer; no responsibility, no cleaning, no nothing. But his mother has a different  plan for him. He does not know it but his mother is getting him a dog so he can take care of it and have a good summer. The thing is, Greg doesn\\"t want the dog so he decides to blow it off. At the end of it all things get worked out. However Greg still feels like he is not having fun this summer so he enjoys the dog the best way he can.    I think that this is a good book because its interesting. I was like that before and I didn't know what I was going to do but at the end of the day I planned something to do. It worked out at the end and I ended up having a great summer just like  Greg did in the story.

B002M2N9JI|4.0|La Roux came out of nowhere is capture the UK charts and launch their very successful debut album.  Drawing from 80's synth-pop artists like the Eurythmics and more modern electronic/dance, La Roux creates a dance-pop record that is at once both new and familiar.  Though the synths and beats are not necessarily the most diverse, the arrangements and front-woman Elly Jackon's vocals allowed the album to achieve wide popularity on the dance floor.  Breakout hit \\"Bulletproof\\" is exemplary of this combination.  Catchy synth is mixed with robotic beats to set the perfect soundscape for Jackson's amazing vocals, which though processed don't sound over-worked.  Though occasionally La Roux's style outshines their substance, this effort stands out amidst a slew of similar 80s revivalists.

B0029358GM|4.0|Alt-country rockers Wilco have been together for a while now, but they still know how to cut a record.  The addition of Nels Cline since Sky Blue Sky has added such a beautiful dimension to their music, and the joy and understanding that comes through on this record is nearly palpable.  Starting from the eponymous opening track, where Jeff Tweedy asserts that through thick and thin \\"Wilco will love you, baby\\", the band enters into relational territory with the fan that few bands care to explore.  Another highlight is \\"Bull Black Nova\\" which steadily builds with a noisy, consuming crescendo reminiscent of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  \\"You and I\\" is a gentle, couple's song that shows off Tweedy's softer side and songwriting ability of being able to do so much with so little.  My favorite is \\"I'll Fight\\" with its messianic imagery and sacrificial message above a jaunting, spiky accompaniment.  Though definitely not as ambitious as some of their earlier releases, Wilco (The Album) displays the band perfecting what they do best and leaves the listener all the better for it.
0316154687|3.0|this was my first Sedaris book and although not totally blown away, it was definitely entertaining and good fun.  i listened to the audio version, which is narrated by Sedaris himself and although this is not an old book (pub. 2008), the dry sarcasm and tone of his voice was reminiscent of an older style of stand up comedy.<br /><br />the book is written in short stories of various happenings in Sedaris's life, including babysitting experiences of his younger days, what it what like going public about being gay, his crazy neighbors (which i can completely relate to!) and a more recent effort to quit smoking.  there were definite highs and lows in the stories, with some absolutely hysterical laugh out loud moments in between. some stories held my interest more than others, notably That's Amore and The Smoking Section, but regardless, it was worth the time spent and i would probably pick up another Sedaris book someday.

B000RPCK1U|2.0|This movie is included in the James Bond Ultimate Edition, Volume 4.  This was the only movie in the set I had not seen yet.  I tried several times to watch it but usually got so bored about thirty minutes into it that I had to cut it off.  Finally, after about 4 years and 5 tries, I forced myself to sit through the whole thing.  Let me tell ya, it was quite an endurance contest.<br /><br />TND suffers from several ailments:  an uninteresting villain, that villain's bland and incompetent henchman, ridiculously over-the-top action sequences (primarily the helicopter chase of the motorcycle), and a by-the-numbers script full of every Bond cliche in the book.  The script seems to have been grown in a laboratory using parts of other Bond movies.  Not one original moment or line of dialogue.  Everything about it seems stale and familiar.  One could argue that the entire franchise itself suffers from that to some degree, but TND is the laziest and most egregious example of it.  The script and the action sequences are cut from a cookie-cutter mold.<br /><br />Perhaps most disappointing was the villain ---  Elliot Carver, a media tycoon who doesn't want to take over the world in the traditional way, but rather set it on fire and have the exclusive media rights to report on it.  YAWN!!!<br /><br />Also, Bond films are noted for their spectacular action sequences.  This film's early one looks rather low rent.  A stealth cruiser unleashes a drill-tipped torpedo to blast through a English Naval destroyer, sink it, and allow the villain's men to dive down to it and steal a nuclear missile.  Looked good on paper, I'm sure, but the whole thing looked like it was done on a low effects budget.  This kind of effects work may have looked cool in the Seventies, but by this film's release in 1999 the audiences had grown a bit more sophisticated.  Too bad for the audience, then.<br /><br />There is a scene about midway through the film where Bond faces Dr. Kaufman, a professional assassin played by character actor Vincent Schiavelli.  The scene must have been played for laughs, because Kaufman is incompetent.  Bad idea.  It just made a lousy film worse.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan looked bored during the entire film.  Who could blame him?<br /><br />Even the franchise's trademark pre-credits sequence was a let-down.  It was almost EXACTLY the same one as in the previous Bond film \\"Goldeneye\\".  Or at least close enough to have a \\"been there, done that\\" feel.<br /><br />Reportedly, the production was a troubled one.  They started shooting without a completed script, the principal actors were unhappy with the flat and one-dimensional way their characters were written, there was a bit of animosity between the director and the screenwriter, and the crew -- many of whom had worked on several Bond films -- said that this was the first unhappy experience they'd had on a Bond film.  With all those elements mixed in, it is no surprise that TND came out to be such a flat and lifeless affair.<br /><br />If this were a rotten film, there might at least be some kind of entertainment value in that alone.  Sometimes bad movies are fun to watch so you can make fun of them as they unspool.  But TND is just boring and tepid.  It is a real chore to sit through.  I can't think of a single reason to ever watch it again.<br /><br />Because it was so boring, maybe they should have called it \\"Tomorrow Never Ends\\".<br /><br />Want to read some more about what a mess this film was?

B001V7YWTQ|2.0|While there's no denying the musicality of the Clapton/Winwood CD, it wasn't even close to the best I've heard from either. More that it was less than the sum of it's parts.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of TV, so I first saw this series on disc (and now have the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of this). The Blu-Ray version definitely looks better, and it's worth picking up if you have the hardware to play it; it's less discs to manage, and the picture quality is terrific. The menus are a little awkward compared to the standard DVD release's menus, but definitely not bad once you get used to them.    Fringe unexpectedly became my favorite show I've ever seen, for a number of reasons. The story is intelligent and well-handled modern sci-fi, and unlike almost anything else on TV the show actually has a purpose. It's not just showing you things to fill a time slot; even spanning into the second season Fringe continues to create an ongoing story out of each show. They're going somewhere with it, and like a good book it's fun and entertaining to find out where it ends up.    More than anything else, the show is character driven. The story revolves around Walter Bishop, a not-so sane scientist, in a role that's played so well that I can't imagine anyone NOT liking him. Emotional, often hilariously funny, and sometimes a little disturbing and even scary... he's one of, or should be considered to be, the most iconic supporting characters on TV. His son, Peter, has a harsh relationship with Walter and the first season of the show builds upon the always interesting friction resulting from the forced end of their estrangement brought on by the main character, Olivia Dunham, during the beginning of the show. Olivia is the serious edge that drives the show forward, the almost-archetypal courageous white knight that's universally been played by a male character everywhere else. She's perfect here; stoic and determined, full of raw emotion that nobody else gets to see outwardly if she can help it, and it's acted and written well enough that she never becomes that stereotypical tough girl who has to act like she's a man fitting into a man's world. It's nice to finally have a strong female lead character who can be tough and still be feminine, something exceptionally rare in films or television.    I love it, five stars. Pick up the Blu-Ray if you're torn between formats, but the DVD version is great enough to recommend as an alternative.
0385340540|5.0|I really enjoyed this thriller.  It had a good mix of location, espionage, conspiracy and redemption in a lead character who started off as an egotist and by the novel's end realized his mistakes, worked to correct them and became a likeable character.  I thought the characters were well-developed and the location in Italy very interesting.  I read The Broker in one night and gave it to my daughter and she LOVED it as well.

B001CQONKY|5.0|As always, we love the original CSI seasons and can't wait to watch the episodes back to back. We rarely get to see CSI until the season is released, so we didn't see the final episode of season 8 until we viewed this season set.  We hated to see such a strong character leave the show.
1400052173|5.0|This book grabbed my attention just a day before it was released and I couldn't wait to order it and get it in my hands; I have not been disappointed! I have read it and am still baffled at how a figure like Henrietta Lacks and her amazing \\"contribution\\" to society have gone unknown by almost everyone. The book is written in very easy to understand language and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of the most popular AND educational books in libraries and schools across the country.    Hats off to Rebecca Skloot for this brilliant book!

B000O77SRC|4.0|If there are any of you out there who---back in the Eighties---initially had a hard time buying Bruce Willis as an action hero and therefore never saw any of the Die Hard flicks.....surprise.  I was one of the naysayers, and only recently saw the movie on DVD.  Well, slap me up and call me silly.  The guy is really believable as a normal, flawed family man who happens to be a cop, who happens to be caught up in a plot masterminded by       people. Amazon's editing wizards prevent the use of some surprisingly inoffensive words (What's up with that, guys?) but let's say the baddies are a 9-letter word beginning and ending with \\"t\\". The usual action-flick extremes abound, but the movie is so well put together that it's easy to buy all the hoke. The cast is great (Alan Rickman paints an astounding picture of a villain) and Willis' John McClane just kind of gets under your skin, even if you never thought he would.  To keep it family-approved, you'll need a slightly edited version---a couple of graphic gunshots make it not-kid-friendly, and Willis's tendency to be a potty-mouth doesn't qualify him as the best role-model----but older audiences will find the story exciting.

The plots are convoluted, and it is hard to separate the different character's stories.  They are just totally unbelievable.  For a mother to try to  deny a child as in \\"Little Face\\" is inconceivable.  I cannot understand how these books are rated so highly.

Well, I found out I was not born in the right month to be an athelete (that is the least of my worries as I am a clutz).  I also found out I was not born on the right continent to be smart in math.  I was also born in the wrong decade to be a successful computer nerd.      Although the information was interesting, I would have successfully saved some dough by checking it out at my public library.  Now there is some good advice.

0385338082|5.0|This book is laugh-out-loud funny from the first chapter. With the kind of writing style that Kinsella keeps throughout the book, you cannot help but want to just carry on reading. I found that this book was brilliantly witty and very funny, while at the same time carrying across the more serious message of relationships and secrecy in them. There were times in this book when I was crying with laughter at the antics of the characters and this shows a good relationship to them, making this book easy to relate to. I think that there are many real-life situations in this book that are made funny and put into a new perspective by a brilliant author. I found that the characters were very well developed on the whole, with maybe one or two that I would have liked a little more from, but on the whole the characters were brilliant. The idea of the secret-keeping was brilliant and the way that they keep almost slipping out when Jack is talking makes for very entertaining reading. I think that this book is definitely one of those that you need to read on a rainy day - it will brighten your day immensely and - like a slab of chocolate - you will want to devour it in one sitting!

B001OQCV2E|5.0|I pride myself on being a movie lover...I have to wonder what those, who find such fault with 2012, expect from a big budget, high octane, CGI infested, summer time, escape movie.  2012 was everything I hoped for and more...was it over the top? Yes!!  Was it unbelievable?  Of course!!  Was it the most fun I had allowing my mind to go places it would otherwise not go??  You bet!!!    Those who want to play amateur movie critic and show how sophisticated their movie taste buds are...I say, 'ppppggghhh'  Give it a rest.  You are probably the same people that find fault with 'The Wizard of Oz', and 'It's a Wonderful Life', and 'The Flight of the Phoenix', and 'Terminator', and 'The Ten Commandments' and 'The Matrix' and countless other GREAT films that require a total suspension of disbelief, but are nontheless incredible cinematic efforts...    I say, if you enjoy a good, action, adventure, science-fiction movie, you can't do any better than 2012.  The bar has been raised.
B001HN6940|4.0|Let me get this out of the way first.<br />And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this.<br />But....I have never read the original story.<br />All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that's about it.<br />Honestly?<br />I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way.<br />I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like \\"Lord of the Rings\\".<br />I can't say if that's accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of \\"Lord of the Rings\\".<br />I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn't be able to pull this off.<br />I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch.<br />It didn't.<br />In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton's crowing jewel of weirdness.<br />If you thought \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" was weird, you haven't seen ANYTHING.<br />This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100.<br />Is that a good thing?<br />It depends.....<br />Did you like \\"Charlie\\"? If the answer is yes, than you'll probably like this.<br />I liked \\"Charlie\\" but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better.<br /><br />Ok....\\"Alice in Wonderland\\".<br />What was good?<br />Masterfull acting from Depp, Carter, and Hathaway.<br />Burton's most visually stunning movie ever.<br />Great score.<br />The film was paced well and wasn't a second too long or too short.<br />I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie. It didn't, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other. Some may say Avatar, but I haven't seen that yet so I really can't compare.<br /><br />What was bad?<br />There really wasn't a whole lot of story to be had here.<br />It had A story just not a very deep one.<br />What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely.<br />I'm knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story.<br />But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really can't complain.<br /><br />Let's sum it up.<br />Burton's most visually stunning film ever.<br />The entire cast is amazingly good.<br />Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work.<br />I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version.

6305313687|5.0|The main thing I liked about this movie is that the storyline was top notch, This movie shows us how bad racism can be and how sad it could end to tragedy. Unfortunatly this was the saddest movie I ever seen but it was a great drama flick. I think edward nortons character as a former leader skinhead should show others especially the youth how bad and how wrong it is to hate others by the color of their skin, Sadly racism is still everywhere and I think some people like this movie for the wrong reasons. It's a shame this movie didn't get an award because I think it was the greatist movie ever.<br /><br />If you like edward norton's movies then look no furhter this movie is for you.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Up in the Air is a timely story about the frontline, corporate downsizers who terminate workers across the country.  It's an unpleasant job with emotional backlash, and George Clooney's performance as a top gun terminator is exemplary. Abetted by assured direction by Jason Reitman (Juno), this is a film for our times.    Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is very good at what he does, and he has the mileage to prove it.  You see, corporations hire him to fly across the country to fire their employees.  So good is Bingham that he has a perfect response for every possible reaction or objection.  It is an art, and he has honed his skills over the years while living an insulated life of perks and frequent flier miles without any emotional attachments or long term plans for the future.  He is even distant from his family.  He has his routine down and lectures as a motivational speaker.  Ah, what a life.    During a layover, he meets another frequent flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga), who, like him, jets cross country and lives on her corporate credit cards and comps.  So begins their jet setting affair and multi-city rendezvous.  When Ryan's employer decides to streamline expenses, a new hired gun, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), brings big changes including cutting down travel expenses and relying more on a telemarketer setup to conduct the corporate firings.  This is a direct threat to Ryan's lifestyle and he proposes to show her the ropes and what it is like to personally fire someone.  It is a sobering, learning experience for Natalie as Ryan mentors her and espouses his words of wisdom and his hands on approach compared to her more empirical, scientific methods.  It becomes apparent that they have differing values and philosophies on life.   When Natalie tries to do a firing, it becomes a game changing event with severe ramifications for all.  She is the young, wide eyed idealist, who learns about life the hard way.     At the same time, Ryan's sister calls about a wedding that he is reluctant to attend.  While most people go home for the holidays, he feels the opposite.  He grudgingly takes pictures of cardboard replicas of his sister and fiancé in his travels since they can't afford the trips.  He even uses his powers of persuasion on his sister's fiancé who has second thoughts about marriage.  It is in this moment that Ryan has an epiphany and learns about himself and what's important in life.  As Ryan begins to have feelings for Alex and sets about to make his future, he discovers some startling, harsh truths that will alter his outlook on life forever.     Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman has created a smart, engaging film whose subject of corporate firings amid an economic downturn is quite timely.  It is those scenes that are fascinating as they are heartbreaking, and Clooney's Ryan is a master at finessing verbal interplay.  This film puts faces and souls on the nameless whose lives are destroyed.  A scene where a fired employee (J. K. Simmons is excellent) is inspired by Ryan to try something else is masterfully written.    Clooney's Ryan is a distant cousin of sorts to his recent standout job in Michael Clayton.  Rarely has he been more charming!  His character lives in airport terminals and judges his success by his independence and frequent flyer miles.  When Natalie, Alex and his own family converge on his life, we see him change, and that is what makes the film so special.  To see someone whose outlook on life is changed forever is a rewarding, enriching feeling.  When Ryan and Alex talk about life from their experiences, it is in stark contrast to the neophyte Natalie.   What is refreshing is to see how Ryan becomes genuinely affected and how in the end he does the right things to correct an injustice.      Farmiga (The Departed) registers strongly as the mysterious lover, and Kendrick (Twilight) shines as the naïve Natalie.  Jason Bateman (Juno) re-ups with Reitman and scores as a corporate manager.  A note of interest is that many of the fired workers are played by actual, laid off employees so that their scenes do take on a sense of immediacy and realism.     This is one of those films that makes all the best lists of the year because it's smartly written, well acted, and leaves you with that aftertaste of time well spent.

B00275EGWY|4.0|Blessed with an insightful script by journalist Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has finally found superior material to apply her talents, and the result is a seminal war film set in Iraq.  This is not the spectacle of war in broad strokes but rather an intimate point of view.  As such, it provides a very personal, visceral experience.    In the middle of the Iraq War, Sgt. J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) welcomes a replacement for a fallen comrade.  The new soldier, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), is a quirky soul whose specialty is disarming bombs.  38 days are left for Bravo Company as the group sets out to diffuse a bomb.  While an automated robot might be appropriate, James insists on doing the job himself and finds a booby trap in the city streets.  After a tense period and an unexpected surprise, he is successful but not before spooking Sanborn and the other soldiers nearby.   His boldness and gambling has serious consequences for his comrades.     James is a loose cannon, but does he have a death wish?  He has the emotional and physical scars from war, and he lives and breathes bombs to the point of keeping bomb parts as souvenirs.  He is addicted to the job, and war gives his life meaning.  He is the perfect war junkie.  It's a high stress existence and the only person a soldier can rely on is his fellow soldier.  These men bond amid difficult life and death situations while there is barely a shot fired.  This is most definitely not Audie Murphy's kind of war.      The risks escalate when a car loaded with explosives is set afire and as James tries to disarm the device, the soldiers attract a lot of attention from the locals who may or may not be innocent observers.  It becomes a precarious situation by the minute as James' expertise is tested to the limit.  We witness the risks of guerilla warfare as threats come from around any street corner.      As days melt down to hours, the tension becomes almost unbearable, and you can feel the anxiety and fear in these men.  There is an arduous sequence as the group gets pinned down by deadly sniper fire amid an oppressive sun.  Later, a heartbreaking scene has James attempting to defuse a bomb strapped to an innocent civilian pleading for his life.  It's a desperate task as the seconds tick away.  The emotions and the impossibility of the situation make for a compelling moment.      James has a wife and son back home where he discovers some truths about himself.  Finding civilian life difficult to adjust to, he realizes the one thing makes him feel alive, and that is a tour of duty.    Some notable actors like Ralph Feinnes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly appear in what are essentially throwaway cameos.  Mackie is good as a soldier whose priorities in life change dramatically through his deployment, and Brian Geraghty registers as a young soldier who cannot wait to return safely to the states.  But it is Renner who excels in the difficult role of a gifted, but troubled soldier.      Bigelow has always been adept at films (Point Break, Blue Steel) with lead characters under extreme duress, and she milks each bomb sequence with measured, tightly edited cuts to agonizingly prolong and heighten the suspense.  She is schooling the public with pure cinematic technique.  We feel a bit detached from these men not because they are not well drawn but because the film tries to show events in a semi-documentary way especially in its generous use of handheld cameras that give the feel of news footage.     This is not a perfect film.  It feels episodic at times, and perhaps that is the point: that war can be a series of moments of danger and uncertainty.  Also, we never fully realize or understand what makes James tick.  We know he is drawn to his job and is very good at what he does. But we never see into his psyche's attraction to this profession beyond the adrenaline rush.      While the film may not accurately portray military tactics or protocal, it does capture the human emotions of impossibly difficult tasks amid a hostile environment.  Credit the filmmakers for exploring a fascinating aspect of warfare.  In terms of driving home the fear and effects of war on the common soldier, few films have ever been better.

B003102JDM|4.0|Writers and directors, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, have often made their mark in cinema (Blood Simple, Fargo) with their take on the human condition shot on an independent film budget.  In A Serious Man they get self reflective on their own childhoods growing up in a Jewish family of the 1960's.  The result is their most personal, incisive film to date, and one that is told with sharp observation and honesty.    An opening scene tells the tale of a peasant couple visited by an elderly man who turns out to be a ghost.  Are they cursed or blessed by this ominous apparition?    In a 1960's Minnesota suburb, Larry Gopnik is a timid college professor with a wife, son, and daughter.  His son is smoking pot, and his daughter steals his money for a nose job.  One day his wife announces that she and his best friend Sy have become close and that she wants a divorce.  Further, Sy wants to have a long talk with Larry to counsel and help him through his tough time.  This happens at the same time Larry is up for tenure at his college, and a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade.  As if this weren't enough, his brother, Arthur, who has all sorts of physical ailments and personal problems, is staying at his house.   Meanwhile, Larry spies on and is tortured by his female neighbor who likes to sunbathe in the nude.      Things go from bad to frustratingly worse as Larry goes to see three rabbis for advice only to get inconclusive or non-answers.  His bills with the attorneys are mounting, and he is told to move out of his own house.  Now the Korean student's dad threatens to sue him, and he is plagued by nightmares.   The events don't turn out as expected and the twists and turns culminate with his son completing his bar mitzvah.  An ominous new set of events threatens to uproot his world even as Larry seeks to make sense and order of his plight and tries to do the right things and be a `serious man'.     The storyline will ring true for most audiences, especiallybaby boomers.  Larry is a brilliant study in angst and suffering.  By the film's ending, the question remains: what is important in one's life?  What matters most?  No commentary is made or judgment passed about Larry and his family, and the Coens offer no answers.  What we get is a case study of one family trying to survive fractious events.  Although told from their Jewish background and experiences, the Coens are able to strike the right emotional connection by showing Larry's response to a difficult set of circumstances.  His feelings and reactions are universal, and perhaps that is the point of the movie: The problems of the common man are eternal and life is a stream of situations that can be daunting and are constantly supplanted by new adversity.  Much as Ordinary People revealed discord and a disconnect in a middle class family, A Serious Man shows this family slowly disintegrating.  Larry's situation bears striking similarities to the lead in Into the Night.    A mostly unknown cast actually helps the film by not having the distraction of well known faces.  They are people like you and me.  Michael Stuhlbarg is quite convincing as Larry, and folks might recognize Arthur portrayed by TV character actor Richard Kind.      It's not the Coens' best work but it is their most intimate one which they could afford to do after winning Best Picture with No Country for Old Men only a couple years before.   It's certainly one of the most original screenplays of the year.

B002VECM4A|4.0|In Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, inner city life for a desperate teen is portrayed as a hopeless cycle of poverty, neglect, and despair.  As envisioned by director Lee Daniels from the adaptation by Geoffrey Fletcher, life is hard and only redeemed by people who care and are willing to nurture the abused victim.  This is a harrowing look at a dysfunctional family and one girl's hope for a better life, and it benefits from towering performances by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique who bring home this heartfelt, slice of life.    The story opens with a pleasant, idyllic family setting with a teenager, Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), and the fantasy turns suddenly into a stark reality.  It is 1987 Harlem where Precious lives as a cook, gofer, and almost as a slave to her domineering, abusive mother (Mo'Nique).  Together, they are poor, always hungry and living on welfare.  She hopes for a normal existence and is always beaten down verbally, physically and emotionally by her mom and the neighborhood gangs.  She was pregnant at age 16 by her abusive, absentee father and already has a small, mentally challenged child by him.  To escape her despair, she daydreams of a loving and supportive storybook world.      Switched to an alternative school that specializes in troubled youth, she meets a disparate group of girls and a disciplined teacher, Miss Rain (Paula Patton).  Precious learns to read and understand a world beyond the confines of her existence.  She begins to trust her teacher, and her support group is this motley group of classmates.  This support comes into play when she gives birth to her second child and when her mother attacks her.      Her mother is so manipulative that she wants to stay on welfare, and she makes no secret of her distrust of white people.  She even puts on a pretend act for a visiting social worker.   At the welfare office, another social worker (Mariah Carey in no makeup) learns the horrible truth about Precious' home life.Before long, Precious receives bad news that rocks her world and sets up a confrontation with her manipulative, con-artist of a mom and determines an uncertain future for herself and her children.      Daniels lends a very sure hand in directing this powerful story.  Even as a novice director, he grabs his audience and keeps you involved in a very interesting tale based on truth. He offers a fresh perspective and after a success at producing (Monsters Ball, The Woodsman), is a talent to watch. The film is shot in almost a handheld semi-documentary manner.  The budget must have been modest which suits the setting and story.  Its technique and exposition belie an independent film (Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are executive producers).    Sidibe and Mo'Nique carry the show, but Patton and Carey are quite good as supportive characters.  Singer Lenny Kravitz has a small but effective part as a male nurse who befriends Precious.      The only real negative is that the film ends abruptly which may be just the point-that life does go on and it does so on Precious' own terms.  This is no Hollywood ending, that's for sure.  Also, repetitive use is made of Precious' daydream fantasies of a happier life.  It almost veers to self parody although there is an excellent moment where she dresses in front of a mirror and sees a well dressed white woman; so much for visual statements about self image.     So good are the portrayals of Precious and her mom that the other characters are given only marginal exposition.  We want to learn more about her teacher and her classmates, but this is, after all, a story about Precious.  For her first acting gig, Sidibe does a remarkable job, and Mo'Nique is so convincing as a maternal monster, that Oscar beckons.  For a film based on real life experiences and truths, this one is hard to beat.

This is one of those classic type movies and I sincerely don't get you people who demand that the story be plausible at every turn and make perfect sense.<br /><br />There used to be a load of movies like this to entertain me in my youth.  If you want a serious film, watch a \\"serious\\" movie.  I had no such expectations.  Just wanted it to take me out of my little world and problems for a while and marvel at the wealth of special effects.  This film gets an A+ in my book!  Watch it and have some fun!!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Quentin Tarantino has been working on this World War II script for many years, and what is ostensibly a revenge film with moments of terrific dialogue and parallel subplots is a bit undone with untidy displays of violence and a fantasy denouement.  Nevertheless, the play is the thing and few writer/directors could fashion such an entertaining if mean spirited film like Inglourious Basterds with bravura performances particularly by Christoph Waltz as a most charming and lethal Nazi.    Once upon a time during World War II a French man is questioned about the whereabouts of local French Jews by a polite German SS officer, Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) whose silky, sinister approach gets remarkable, deadly results from which one teenage French girl barely escapes.    Next we meet Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt giving a Chad Everett by way of Clark Gable impression) who has recruited Jewish soldiers to hunt down and terrorize the Nazis in an Apache Indian way.  Any survivors do not escape unscathed but have a Swastika cross carved into their foreheads, their mark for life.      In 1944, a young French woman, Emmanuelle, owns a movie theater and is wooed by a German war hero, Fredrick, whose  film, Nation's Pride, is premiering in Paris.  Fredrick gets Joseph Goebbels, head of German Propaganda to move the premiere to Emmanuelle's smaller theater.  She is in fact the young French girl (Shosanna) who escaped a massacre and is plotting to take revenge by killing all the Nazi attendees.      At the same time, British Lt. Archie Hicox is sent to meet a double agent in France and, with Raine's men, attend the Nation's Pride premiere to blowup the theater and kill high level Nazis including Hitler.  Hicox meets the agent who is a famous German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger is glamorous) in a basement cafe.  German soldiers and an SS officer complicate things, and a Mexican standoff ensues with explosive results.  Having to alter plans, Raine substitutes himself and the surviving Basterds into the mission.    At the premiere, as head of security, Col. Landa discovers the Allied plot, and Raine is arrested and interrogated in another building.  There, Landa makes a startling proposal even as Emmanuelle plots to ignite the film nitrate stored in her theater and the other `basterds' in the audience execute their part of the plan.  Seemingly spared the finale at the theater and having manipulated his own fate, Col. Landa and Lt. Raine have a day of reckoning.    The usual Tarantino touches are here including excruciating scenes with gunshots, scalpings, stabbings, and bat beatings.  The film is structured in five chapters, and his love for movies is evident in references to German cinema icons, and, no doubt, major filmic influences from The Dirty Dozen (especially in the recruitment scene and the high octane finale), Where Eagles Dare, and any number of spaghetti westerns.  Imaginative use is made of fluid camera movement and rapid edits.      While the cast is in fine form with Til Schweiger as a Charles Bronson-type, director Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, and Mélanie Laurent,  radiant as the haunted Emmanuelle, the standout is Waltz.  Pitt is a hoot as Raine (whose name is a play on actor Aldo Ray), and when he tries to spout Italian phrases, it is outrageous.  Veteran Rod Taylor and comedian Mike Myers have fleeting cameos.    Some criticism of the film is warranted.  Infamous figures get killed at the premiere; if you are going to rewrite history even in a fable, don't take something that is so ingrained as to make an utter mockery of it.  Also, any sympathetic characters pretty much go out the window, so don't get too attached to anyone.      No Tarantino film would be complete without wonderfully written set pieces especially the one in the basement café that is very reminiscent of the final standoff in Reservoir Dogs.  While his words are sublime and he is adept at setting up such scenes, he does not take full advantage of the possibilities of others which are given relatively short shrift like the arrest of Raine and the confrontation of Bridget by Col. Landa.      For fans of the talented director, this one is a must, but for the average moviegoer, the snappy screenplay may not be fully appreciated in the overall context of an entertaining story that drips a bit too much blood. Two things are for sure: A glass of milk will never seem the same again, and Brad Pitt looks fabulous in a white tuxedo.
0312427999|5.0|Pohl's 1950's book opens with an advertising agency's army forcing Outer Mongolia to accept billboards.  His prediction was right on the nose, only, as Klein points out, the U.S. taxpayer paid for the effort not the corporations whom such wars benefited.  The great thing about Iraq and post-Katrina Louisiana for that matter is that contractors paid for by taxpayer dollars were never subject to taxpayer oversight.  Klein successfully reviews the more than half a century of tax payer subsidies of wars that benefited only the corporations. Do not be aroused by what you will read in this book; you can always tell other people that you were a \\"good\\" American and were never a member of the Nazi party.<br />  Message to Klein: Surely an updated second edition is called for in which you point out that Bush and Cheney were never prosecuted for War Crimes and that Obama running on a \\"Get Out of Iraq\\" platform expanded the war effort into neighboring countries. Oh, and whereas the Taliban had banned the growth of poppies, Bush put heroin back on the streets of America.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|You would think that the man who redefined science fiction and action films over the past quarter century (Terminator, True Lies) and culminated with the best hat trick in movie history with Titanic garnering superlative reviews, earning the all-time box office, and winning a record 11 Oscars, would be satisfied and perhaps go on cruise control with a smaller film.  But no, Cameron aims higher with a thrilling adventure that combines game changing special effects that have to be seen on the big screen in 3-D.     In the not too distant future, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a physically challenged soldier, volunteers for an unusual mission on a far away planet, Pandora, a beautiful yet dangerous world where the blue skinned Na'vi are a primitive, enlightened race who are at one with nature and its balance of life as epitomized by the Tree of Souls, a kind of fiber optic tree that has a consciousness.  Utilizing a unique technology that enables Sully to become sentient in a genetically engineered substitute Na'vi body or avatar, he is deposited on Pandora to assimilate himself into their culture.  Led by a stern, no-nonsense scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake learns the ways of the Na'vi people especially through Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a proud warrior (much like the heroine in Heavy Metal) whose father is the tribal leader.  You just know that Jake and Neytiri are going to become closer in their relationship.      Sully's commanding officer, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), expects him to gather intelligence on the Na'vi defense and capabilities in an effort to secure the valuable minerals beneath the Na'vi settlement.  It seems that a mining company wants the minerals at any cost.  As Sully bonds with these people and realizes that what the military plans to do, he has a change of heart and rallies all the villages to band together for a last stand and a simple battle between good and evil ensues with the Na'vi hopelessly outgunned and overly matched.      The story is simple with political overtones about preserving a green planet and the clash between science and the military.  This military is an extension of the bad asses in Cameron's Aliens.  There are obvious parallels to the Iraq War with its natural oil resource.  You can see elements of The Matrix with its out of body experience, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with its David versus Goliath setup.  Any fan of old Tarzan films knows how nature is harnessed by the hero.  You get the feeling that this planet's life force is a collective much as the trees in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that something extraordinary might happen.  The avatar plot device bares loose similarities to the 1960's TV show Outer Limits episode Chameleon.  While Jake has damaged legs, he is able to revel in his new body and experiences what amounts to a rebirth. His initiation into Na'vi life is not dissimilar to the initiation rites in Dances with Wolves.      Apparently Cameron has been gestating this idea for many years, waiting for movie technology to catch up to his complicated visuals.  It was worth the wait.  He has always been at the forefront of state of the art effects (The Abyss, Terminator 2) so it comes as no surprise that he has single handedly elevated the creative possibilities of 3-D presentation to the mainstream.  Cameron does not resort to using 3-D as a gimmick by simply throwing objects at the screen but rather organically and even shots of the planet's jungles are fully realized settings with plant life and insects that jump out of the screen.  The motion capture compliments and reflects real acting.  What is remarkable is that this film is simultaneously demonstrating multiple visual effects in a seamlessly integrated presentation courtesy of Cameron's fertile imagination.      Production values don't get any better.  James Horner composes an energetic yet tender score that evokes his own Titanic and Glory.  Although the second half settles intoa more conventional war film, that's a minor complaint. There is a reference to Jake's late brother (a subplot that does not add much to the story) who was originally slated for the mission.      Worthington and Saldana (Star Trek), in expressive motion capture, do a very solid job of emoting real feelings and making their love a tangible, believable union.  Lang has an intimidating presence as the military commander and it's nice to see his career resurgence (Public Enemies).  Weaver lends strong support as the wise, impassioned scientist who will defend the Na'vis even with her life.      Make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking film in terms of technical achievement and theatrical presentation.  It needs to be experienced in 3-D to get the complete experience.  Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this landmark film.

B002VECM6S|4.0|In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock.  In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular filmmaking and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.    Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's `blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success.  This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.      Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school.  Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports.  Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock).  She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family.  Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.      Encouraged by his `family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field.  He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates.  Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results.  Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant.  To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, MissSue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role).  When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.      There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael.  And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing.  When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout.  It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends.  The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz.  What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins.  Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.      Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast.  The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean.  But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will.  It's the kind of performance that gets awards.  Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.      This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick.   (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.)  Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her ownfail cannot help but touch and inspire.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|This film is an experiment in relatively low budget filmmaking based on an interesting concept.  Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings trilogy) acts as producer for newbie director Neill Blomkamp and a script by Blomkamp and Terri Tacthell to create an imaginative, powerful film whose DNA is civil strife in South Africa.  Much as High Noon was about the Communist `witch hunts' of the late 1940's and The Sand Pebbles was a corollary to the Vietnam War, District 9 smacks of Apartheid commentary in its home setting of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The results are a well made science fiction film that integrates an important message.    A government civil servant worker named Wikus Van De Merwe leads a relocation of an alien race dubbed `The Prawns' from their current home in District 9 to a camp in a different part of South Africa.   The military also wants to make use of the sophisticated alien weaponry that can only be operated by the aliens DNA.       Wikus leads a group of soldiers into an alien camp and during the confrontation, he finds a mysterious vile that explodes when opened and splashes his face with an unknown substance.  And quicker than you can say, The Fly, he starts to notice some startling changes as his body becomes nauseous and altered.  A reunion at home with his wife and friends becomes a tragic start of something ominous and, when the military realizes the unlimited value of Wikus' genetic ability to operate the alien weaponry, he becomes a hunted fugitive.      Trying to find refuge in the alien camp, he locates one of the aliens who concocted the substance. And the two devise a plan to steal the liquid now in military custody.  The alien needs the material for his ship and, in exchange, he will help Wikus.  Can he be trusted? How fast before Wikus changes completely?  Back in District 9, the alien attempts to liftoff in his ship with his son, and Wikus has similar plans to escape.  Soon the military catches up to them for an explosive climax.  At that moment, Wikus makes a momentous decision that will change his life and the fate of his alien companion.      The mostly unknown cast is uniformly excellent and capably led by Sharlto Copley as Wikus.   Technical credits are superior particularly makeup and visual effects.  Good use is made of a periodic timeline to show the passage of time and development of the events.  Lots of handheld cameras and lack of a musical score lend a feeling of immediacy and reality.  Told in a quasi-documentary style through flashbacks and interviews, the film takes on a realistic aura grounded in truth.  Rarely has a science fiction film (Cloverfield) ever been presented in this convincing manner.  This is narrative driven and doesn't let up.  Once it begins, you have to hang on for dear life.      A number of topics are ever present throughout the film including segregation and racism, military dominance, and ultimately love.  Do aliens have rights? Do they have a soul?  It's a great premise for a film that the filmmakers take and expand upon.  There is the use of private military contractors, and instead of oil, the resource the military seeks is superior technology in weaponry.      The film has elements of other films like Alien Nation, Black Hawk Down and Starship Troopers.  It's not for all tastes but for those who appreciate this genre with a moral twist, it is a rewarding experience.  The action is graphic and unrelenting as the stakes get higher.   As violent and startling as some of the scenes are-no punches pulled here, there is a noble theme that is never lost.  What comes through in District 9 is its humanity amid the aliens and hardware, and the final shot cannot help but be affecting.  Wow, an independent science fiction film with state of the art technical effects and a compelling, intimate story.  Where do I sign up?
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This film was done very well.  I loved the mood they set with how it was styled.  I will say however that I did not really enjoy the subject of the mystery they were on so that ruined it a bit for me.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Based on a memoir by Lynn Barber, supposedly this script, adapted by novelist Nick Hornby (About a Boy), was one of the great unproduced movies in Britain.  Well no more.  A winning performance by newcomer Carey Mulligan realizes a complex character in An Education, a fascinating study of growing up quickly in an adult world.     Following some dazzling opening credits, we see a teenage girl, Jenny (Mulligan), who is attending high school in the suburbs of London in 1961.  Prodded by her parents to study hard and take cello, they dream of her acceptance to Oxford University and becoming financially secure.  A top student, she desperately wants to break out of her routine and, instead, attend concerts, art galleries, and experience more of the world. Her parents feel otherwise.  One rainy day, a handsome, older man named David (Peter Sarsgaard) drives up and offers her a lift home.  David is a student of life.  He attracts and fascinates her, and what starts innocently as an unlikely friendship develops into a deeper relationship.  He is adept at charming her parents into letting her exceed her curfew and boundaries, and Jenny gets to go to an art auction, Oxford campus, and in time, even a romantic Paris getaway complete with a sunset by the River Seine.      Despite the overtures of a fellow student, Graham, he is no match for the sophisticated, mature, and apparently wealthy David.  Jenny becomes self assured and even insubordinate to her teachers and principal despite their warnings and protestations.  She revels in her new life with David and his carefree friends Danny and Helen, and the foursome venture into the night for partying and taking in the highlife.  As romance deepens and her defiance of authority and protocol increases, can marriage be far behind, and how will Jenny's parents react?    David is a mystery as are his motives.  What does he do for a living, and is he for real?   Perhaps his carefree life is not as glamorous as it seems.  As Jenny findsout, life can be full of joy and surprises, and one moment she can be master of her own fate and the next instant everything could come shattering down around her.  As much as her world has broadened and expanded, she also learns about humility and contrition.  Such is the education of a girl learning about herself at a crucial moment in her life.      Director Lone Scherfig does a splendid job of telling a coming of age tale that hits the right notes.  What this film does well is to put us inside the head of Jenny.  We feel her yearnings and frustrations.  We experience her highs and exhilaration at finding a life beyond her home.  We also hurt when morality is twisted and she is disappointed and betrayed.  That's not just good writing (which it really is); it's a well directed ensemble of talented actors starting with Mulligan. Production values are modest, but the period costumes and background music are infectious and authentic.       Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Jarhead) is quite magnetic as the manipulative David and inflects a convincing British accent.  His scenes with Mulligan are affecting and sustain interest.  Alfred Molina is good as Jenny's stern father, while Emma Thompson is on too briefly as a proper school principal.  Olivia Williams is effective as a teacher who will play a significant role in Jenny's future.    Aside from its portrayal of a teenager, the film depicts the apparently limited options for a graduating female at the time.  She either could excel academically and get a job, or she could find a husband who could take care of her.  It is interesting how Jenny's parents are motivated by this mode of thinking and how it guides their actions.  There is an aspect to the story which borders on statutory laws regarding sex with a girl who is barely of adult age.  The storytellers finesse their way around this and focus on the relationship and do a tasteful job in minimizing the lurid possibilities.  Subtle hints of racism are folded into the narrative,this being the 1960's.    In the end, it is Carey Mulligan in a star making turn as the idealistic teen who matures ahead of her own time and learns about life the hard way.  Love that poster.

B001HN694K|4.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a literary/intellectual story, full of clever ideas and wordplay, which render it essentially unfilmable. It's highly episodic and has no particular point (unlike \\"Though the Looking Glass\\", which at least offers the conceit that the story represents a chess game). But its fantasy elements have tempted too many filmmakers who ought to have known better.<br /><br />I haven't seen every version, but up to now, the least-bad has been -- yes -- the 1951 Disney version, which, when it sticks with the original, is quite good. But I've long felt that, if you're going to turn \\"Alice\\" into a film, it should be aimed at adults, and emphasize the darker elements of the story.<br /><br />This is what Tim Burton has finally given us. Linda Woolverton (who penned several successful Disney features) put together a script that provides dramatic movement -- Alice is destined to kill the Jabberwock *, which the Red Queen uses to threaten those who would oppose her. Whether this is the best-possible dramatic arc, I don't know, but it's at least broadly consistent with the original story. It also roughly parallels Alice's need to stand up for herself and reject the wussy twit her mother and late father's business partner have chosen for her to marry. Yes, this is trite and obvious -- but how many basic storylines /are/ there? This is one of the two most-basic -- someone has to make an important decision. (The other is \\"someone wants something they're blocked from getting\\".)<br /><br />Not only is the Burton/Woolverton take on the story dark, but so is the imagery. With the exception of the White Queen's abode, \\"Underland\\" is a dark and often-dismal place. This is absolutely not a film for children much under the age of 12. It comes close to PG-13, not so much for content, but for tone. The tykes will neither appreciate it nor enjoy it.<br /><br />Adults probably will.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I've heard from many people that this book was basically Harry Potter meets Twilight, the later of which I was never a fan of at all. So I never thought twice about reading this book until recently.      The first page was enough to get me interested, and I fell head first into the rest. I really enjoyed it! The plot was fast paced, adventurous, the characters were written really well, and the entire thing was thoroughly enjoyable. It did have its rough patches where the plot made no sense, and there were times when the entire thing seemed to have massive plot holes, but they were few and far between. I will be reading the next 2 books and I hope that they are just as good, if not better than City of Bones.
B002QW7ALM|1.0|- The first 15 minutes look promising. After that things go bad very quickly.      - The special effects look primitive.    - Suspense exists only in the first 15 minutes. The rest of the movie is boring.    - The acting is not engaging.    - The fighting scenes are hilarious. They're short and hard to see. Cung Le's talent was completely wasted by the director. It clearly shows that he does not know how to stage fighting scenes.     Le is a famous fighter of mixed martial art. In 2008, he broke the right arm of veteran fighter Frank Shamrock with his killer kicks. He became Strikeforce Middleweight Champion that night in San Jose. On YouTube, you can watch some exciting and gripping clips of his fights. They include Cung Le versus Frank Shamrock, versus Warren Strike, versus Nashun.    It's amazing and spectacular to see him floored opponents who were much taller and heavier than he is. His signature \\"scissor\\" kicks are one of his techniques to take down his opponents. The YouTube clips are free and yet they're much more interesting than this movie.    **** Warning. SPOILERSs ahead. DO NOT READ FURTHER if you have not watched it.    - The worst thing is the ending. It turns out that everything came from the illusion in the head of the main character! Yeah! This plot has been recycled hundreds of times before.    - RottenTomatoes dot com shows this movie made $10,261,085 at the box office. This amount accurately reflects how bad it is. In short, there is nothing worth watching here. I regret spending money to watch it in the theatre.

While many of the songs are stronger than Workingman's Dead, personally I find that album as a whole to be a bit more satisfying. But this is still the Dead at their best (most of these songs are what got me into the Dead in the first place), and even more of these went on to be classics, even getting moderate radio play. Not that this is a \\"sell out\\" album or anything like that, it's just a great record with almost universal appeal. The classic line is: \\"I don't get the Grateful Dead, but I've always loved this album.\\" Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, Sugar Magnolia, Ripple, Brokedown Palace, and Truckin' are some of finest and most genuine tunes they ever recorded. A classic music collection just isn't complete without it.

I own all of their albums, but none of them have surprised me quite like The Emptiness. It has energy, passion, epicness, heaviness, melody, and complexity. How could you ask for anything else? It stands out from their other albums because of the reasons I just mentioned and it shows how much they've matured in such a short period of time. Their other albums seemed to be missing something; that \\"it\\" factor. The Emptiness definitely has \\"it\\", and there is a never a dull moment to be heard. The screams are brutal (more growls), riffs are complex, drums are loud, choruses are catchy, and no more poppy bass lines. There is even a solo and breakdown here and there. This is a real screamo album, not some pop/punk screaming concoction. This is a key defining feature of the Emptiness as opposed to the other Alesana albums. Besides the music, the story behind the album is intriguing. This is definitely a concept album. The songs are seen through the eyes of a man who has suffered the tragedy of the woman he loved being murdered. The songs explain all of the emotions he is feeling, and Alesana does a great job to make it feel real. Between songs, there are little interludes that help explain the storyline even more. With that, this album feels a little darker than their others. Along with the interludes, the hard copy has 2 booklets; one with lyrics and the other is actually the short story behind the album. Overall, the music sounds amazing and the concept is ingenious. Whether an Alesana or just a general screamo fan, this album is a must have.

0061733199|5.0|Hey!<br /><br />This is the book to read if you want to know how to survive high-risk, difficult situations. Chances may be good you never have to use the information in here, but it certainly can't hurt, and in the current economy, the information may come in handy in a non-survival situation.<br /><br />I've read a lot of Survival Handbooks, and I like the variety of information in them, but this one is the one that I really had to have. The information goes a little deeper, and it all is laid out in a attention grabbing way. This one also hase the broadest range of subjects, attempting to cover more survival situations than most books. And it does a pretty decent job of covering them, too. However, John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman hasn't been in the SAS for a very long time, so the modern methods they use aren't going to be in here. But it is a great reference to use on survival methods, and I intend to learn the skills they mention.<br /><br />Hope that helps all you potential customers, and happy reading!<br /><br />Luv ya,<br />Tashi :)

B000FM38SO|4.0|I read the book of Mark Shand, as I do with all his books since I read Travels on my Elephant. I was travelling in India at that time and after reading his book about his beloved Tara, we decided to move up north in India and meet her. And so I did. I guess she liked me because she gave me a hug with her trunk...There started my love for the Asian Elephant. And when I can do something to contribute just a tiny bit to the survival of that beautiful creature, I will. Parbati is an amazing woman, gifted, and Mark's always a pleasure to read or listen to. But I did like the book better... so everybody, go and read the book as well!

1439157383|2.0|Disclaimer: I neither read nor enjoy much bestselling contemporary fiction. There are exceptions (I like Elizabeth Berg, John Grisham, and some Stephen King) but in general, these books are not my cup of tea because I feel that they sacrifice good writing for popular plot twists and edge-of-the-seat drama. I especially steer away from \\"chick lit\\" and even more some from family-based drama that is about a mother and her children, because I usually find that it's overly cutesy and I just can't relate to it.<br /><br />But. My mom had been telling me I need to read My Sister's Keeper, and she sent a copy of the book to me. Even my sister, who hates to read, read and enjoyed the book. Then, a movie was coming out about it with a concept that looked new and interesting: one sister was created so that her other sister could live. I thought, I'd better read the book.<br /><br />Well. What can I say? I guess My Sister's Keeper was everything I had expected to be. It had an interesting theme and some dramatic plot twists, but lacked good writing (for the most part) and character depth.<br /><br />The main character is Anna, who is supposed to give up a kidney to save her sister from dying from cancer, or at least to prolong her life a bit longer. Anna has been doing similar things since she was born and her umbilical cord was used for a transplant for her sister. Her parents had purposefully created her to save or prolong her sister' life. At the beginning of the book, Anna has decided to fight back and has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit for rights over her medical decisions (the legal aspects of the book are pretty murky).<br /><br />The story is told in different first-person points of view, with each chapter being told by a different character, whose name is plastered on top, and, get this, the font type and style even changes with each chapter so you know it's being told by someone else. (Gag.)<br /><br />I felt that Anna's voice was interesting and pretty convincing for a young teenage character. This made it feel like a young adult novel, but hey, I like young adult novels so I wish the entire book were told by Anna; I might have liked it a lot better. I hated the parts that were told by the mother because I was mad at her for having a baby for her own selfish purposes-although some may not think that keeping another child alive is a selfish purposes). Try as I might to grasp it by reading her sentimental and overly-protective dribble, I wasn't convinced that a mother, let alone this mother who was telling the story, could really do such a thing, and feel no shame or doubts about it. My own mother could relate to the mother of the book more than I could, so maybe it's a mother thing. Still, the mother came across as a self-righteous know-it-all to me. I didn't believe that she had had a successful law practice before beoming a mother, and I didn't feel any real love between her and her husband.<br /><br />Speaking of the husband, the chapters that were told by him and his son, Anna's brother, read horribly for me. I just wanted to skip them. He's a fire-fighter, which I thought was conveniently contrived and also very unrealistic (I just kept thining, who is paying for this family's sometimes almost luxurious lifestyle when the father is a fire-fighter and the mother is a stay-at-home mom who only practiced law briefly before having kids and is therefore probably in a lot of student loan debt?). He seems more ambivalent about the family's decision to have one child to save another child, but he comes across like a spineless wimp who's afraid of expressing his opinion to his wife, or, worse, like he doesn't care enough to do so. And the brother, Jesse, is a juvenile delinquent, which also feels very contrived, who is out roaming the streets and starting fires that his father has to put out without knowing that his son started them (see the irony? har har). His character does the best job of capturing the anger and angst that I'msure Anna was feeling and that most of the readers would be feeling. Still, he comes across as superficial and stereotypical. The voices all blend together and do not sound like individual characters, a pet peeve I have when an author tries to do different points of view. Anna's came across as the strongest but the rest of the narrators--including the guardian ad liten and Anna's lawyer, both of whom get a turn--all jumbled together into one indistinguisable or trying-too-hard voice.<br /><br />The legal sub-plots of the book didn't seem realistic, although I did enjoy the character of Anna's lawyer and his German Shepherd dog named Judge. He (the lawyer, but also his dog) seemed to be the only rationale character while the rest of them were floating around in no-man's-land.<br /><br />I did enjoy the plot of the book and it was a very easy read. I read it during a rainy camping trip where I had the luxury of laying in a tent all day. I wanted to find out what happened, and at times there was a piece of beautiful writing included. Most of the time, however, the writing was gimmicky and overly sentimental and I felt like I was just pushing through to see what happens, like in a movie, not a well-written book. And then when I got to the end I was so annoyed that I seriously wanted to throw the book out into the mud. I won't include any spoilers but it was the worst ending I think I have ever read, and such an easy way out that I think Picoult should be ashamed of herself. I hadn't planned to read any more of her books because I was more interested in the concept of this one than the writing, but, having gotten to the end only to be let down as a reader in such a huge way, I am 100% sure that I will never read anything else by her. (Yes, I was that mad at how she wrote the ending! Grrr.)<br /><br />So, I give My Sister's Keeper two stars because there were parts of it that I enjoyed, but the rest of it was downright awful. I cannot in good conscience recommend it, but I think it's one of those books that people read because everyone else is reading it and talking about it (which is never a bad thing, people talking about books), and because there's a movie, all of which were reasons I read it, so, read it and see whether you agree with my many critiques or if you find something redeeming in it. By the way I later watched the movie and enjoyed it. The ending was much better than in the book although they did leave some things out from the book's plot that I missed. I would recommend the movie over the book, which I rarely do, but, there you have it. I guess in the end my foray into popular family-drama chick lit proved to be what I thought it would be: mostly empty, with a few splashes of interest and annoyance.<br /><br />For more book reviews and other posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my blog, Voracia: Goddess of Words.aders would be feeling.

0316066524|5.0|This is a great book for rigorous readers.    It's long on pages, short on descriptive dialogue, generous in unreliable points of view, and requiring of footnotes.    \\"Infinite Jest\\" asks tough questions and answers with profound insights - insights that are only available through the many wild and varied perspectives.    The book is satisfying for the patient and diligent who can get through each word using the end notes without fixating on literary analysis.    Once the right reading rhythm or hook is found for the particular reader there is something in this book for everyone.     The crudest available conceptualization of \\"Infinite Jest\\" would be 35 percent \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" 35 percent \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" 10 percent upper division physics, 10 percent upper division game theory, and the remaining ten percent a mix of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and history.

B002WCLG3O|5.0|I have played and beaten all of the Halo games except Halo Wars and not yet released Halo Reach. I have also read a few of the books and some of them are pretty good. So I figured I would give the anime a shot too. Man was I glad that I did.<br /><br />It is actually split into seven episodes, though I would debate eight since Origins has two parts. So it is not one full length movie, but pieces that give you some history and honostly some where done for fun in my honost opinion.<br /><br />Origins I and II were done by Studio 4 C (Tekkon Kinkreet) which gives you background story into Halo by telling you more about it's history than anything previously. The style of animation overall was good, but it moved very slowly for me and is while it will help people new to Halo understand Halo better, it offers more to strong Halo fans.<br /><br />The Duel is about medievil time period of the Elites and is done by Production I.G. (Fooly Cooly \\"FLCL\\") and with Mamoru Oshii (director of Ghost in the Shell) which has a unique water color style with animation. It feels like Feudal Japan with aliens. I don't know how else to explain it other than that. It does move at a Ghost in the Shell style pace which once again is kind of slow, but really the story is quite interesting.<br /><br />Homecoming is done by Production I.G. once again, but the style of animation is much more vivid. The story goes into the background of how Spartans were trained and kind of created in a sense. By far my favorite piece in Legends. It has a darker tone and has things to offer both fans of the story and people who just really enjoy anime.<br /><br />Odd One Out is completely none canon so it doesn't offer much to Halo fans. It is meant to be more of a comedy piece. Done by Toei (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, One Piece, Hokuto no Ken \\"Fist of the North Star\\") with the animation style of Akira Toriyama this is most definitly geared towards anime fans. I really enjoyed the oddness of it, but if you don't like anime and you just want more story for Halo, you won't enjoy this one as much.<br /><br />Prototype is done by Studio Bones (Fullmetal Alchemist, Xam'd: Lost Memories, Kurau Phantom Memory, Rahxephon) and is my second favorite piece in this collection. For those of you who know the Halo story well it has to do with The Cole Protocol which is the issue ordered to destroy any devices not yet completed and delete any information that could lead the covenant to Earth. A very dramatic story and quite enjoyable. The animation is great as well. Can be enjoyed by Halo fans and anime fans alike.<br /><br />Babysitter is done by Studio 4 C once again. It has a slightly lighter tone to the artwork than Homecoming, but is very dark story wise. It follows the ODST and they get signed up with a Spartan. For those who are fans of the Halo story you can guess how they feel what sort of direction the story takes. It honostly was very predictable, but my third favorite piece. Really does well at driving the Halo story and also giving something to anime fans who are curious about the Halo universe outside the games.<br /><br />The Package directed by Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Appleseed Ex Machina, Vexille) is a great piece for fans of Halo and uses computer graphics that make it feel much more like the games. The character artwork is anime style, but you won't really notice that much. Amazing to watch if you are a fan of Halo more than anime. It also says Master Chief's name in it for those of you who don't know his first name. You also see what a group of Spartans are capable of.<br /><br />Now I tried to avoid spoilers so I just tried to explain more what to expect, so sorry that it's vague. I also was trying to show it from a point of view of someone who enjoys anime and is fairly familiar with the Halo universe.<br /><br />Finally since I did this on the Blu-Ray version the reason I believe you should go with Blu-Ray. Honostly the art is amazing and the sound might only be 5.1 which is achievable through DVD it is fully uncompressed. To watch this in 1080p was a great experience. The anime groups, companies and directors that worked on this are masters of their field which really helped bring me in and while some of the pieces where slow, they weren't bad. I think it's worth owning even if you just love anime and if you like Halo this adds a lot to the overall story. I listed the names of all the episodes and the studios that worked on them for those who were curious. It is also in the extras which it has plenty of goodies for those who like them and one of the few Movies or rather \\"OVA\\" collection that I watched all of them. Honostly I hope you enjoy it as much as I did being a fan of anime and knowing the world of Halo.watch this in 1080p was a great experience.

My biggest complaint about this book is that there are exactly zero characters that I warmed up to (Just thinking about that - UGH!) or wanted to hear from or wanted to know more about.  I understand it is supposed to be funny - but trust me, this book is not funny like the early Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum books.  It is not funny in any way.  I admit it, I just don't get the attraction!

B00003CWRX|5.0|This movie tells the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, a former tobacco executive, who decided to appear on the CBS-TV News show \\"60 Minutes.\\" As matter of conscience partially prodded by producer Lowell Bergman, he revealed that, the tobacco industry was not only aware that cigarettes are addictive & harmful, but deliberately worked on increasing that addictiveness. Unfortunately, both protagonists of this story learn the hard way that simply telling the truth is not enough as they struggle against both Big Tobacco's attempts to silence them and the CBS TV Network's own cowardly complict preference of putting money as a higher priority over the truth.  This movie is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Surprisingly, it is Crowe that drives this movie forward, and his portrayal of Wigand is spot-on perfect. This movie is quiet, intense, and ultimately, extremely moving. Recommended.

0156030306|5.0|Science fiction, in its purest form, works something like this: you take an idea, scientific, technical, or even just speculative, and you apply it to human beings. And then you step back from the scientific, technical or speculative idea and focus on what it has done to human beings. Flowers for Algernon, both in its shorter and longer forms, does just this. We aren't told, and do not need to be told, just how the experimental brain surgery works. We are not treated to long discourses about neuroscience or brain chemistry. Instead, we take the idea that the mind is conditioned by the efficiency of the brain, and we apply it to a real person: Charlie Gordon, a mentally handicapped man who volunteers for experimental surgery to improve his intelligence.    The story is both brilliant and tragic on several levels. Charlie becomes smarter, and then a genius, and with this comes the realization that the world is both complex and even cruel. The authority figures who provided him with comfort, who cared enough about him to want to help him improve himself, soon become helpless as his mind begins an inevitable decay back into the despair of his handicap. And at the end, when he is back where he began, there remains the memory that he was once so much more, that he was not the butt of cruel jokes but a man who could contribute, who could do so much.    But Flowers for Algernon is more than simply this tragic tale. It raises the very real question of whether or not we are merely our brains, or is there more to us than simply neurons firing? For Charlie, the basic person who he is, does not change because of the surgery; rather it merely gives him the ability to interpret the world more efficiently. Stupid or brilliant, he is still himself throughout. And throughout, he is fully aware of what is happening to him. This may be a hopeful thought, comforting to the reader, or it may be a resignation to the idea that we cannot, no matter how we try, really change ourselves, evenwith the genius of science.
0785134352|5.0|You NEED to read this, before or after the movie, it doesn't matter.    It's the best Superhero story that isn't a Marvel character.  (Though Marvel did publish it)    Here's what it's about, without giving away anything that doesn't happen in the first few pages of the book:    Our main character Dave loves reading superhero comics.  And he watches superhero movies with his highschool friends and discusses what was good or bad about them.  He realizes that HE really wants to be a superhero.  So he makes himself a green costume and wears it to school under his clothes with no one else knowing.  Later he figures he can't REALLY be a superhero unless he actually stops a crime.      So he takes off his school clothes and walks the streets in his superhero uniform.  He sees some teens spray painting a wall and decides to stop them.  He attacks them with his club.  Then one kid strikes back and STABS HIM IN THE CHEST!  (This is all in the first few pages, so it's not ruining anything for you, I promise.)    It's what would happen if in the real world a teen decided to be a superhero and stop crime.  There's no superpowers, just willpower and superhero uniforms.  It's violent, hilarious, and exciting all at once.  Other characters like Red Mist, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl start showing up as well, and they all fight crime in some way.    As for our main character Dave?  Like this book, he's KICK-ASS!    This is so excellent, you'll be happy you got it.  5 stars definitely.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Castaway presents an interesting series of premises. The first, and most obvious, is a survival story: Chuck Noland is the sole survivor of the crash of a cargo plane, and finds himself stranded on a very small island in the South Pacific. He must learn to survive there, and we are treated a a painful series of scenes as he does so, salvaging what he can from the wreckage and from the body of a comrade. Tom Hanks does a fine job with the role, and despite the beauty of the island, it never is allowed to feel welcoming to us.    But what makes Castaway a step above is that is isn't about the island, or about Noland's survival. Rather, it is about what the experience does to him, how he deals with the loss of pretty much everything in his life. For his is a sort of death, a sort of purgatory, a liminal state. And then we see him leave his island and achieve rescue.    Here the movie could have ended, and many stories would have, giving in to the all too common desire to have a happy ending (see films like either version of [[ASIN:B00008MTVZ The Flight of the Phoenix]]/[[ASIN:B0007KIFI2 Flight of the Phoenix]]). But what pushes Castaway into a class of its own is that we get to witness Noland's rebirth, his resurrection of sorts. Helen Hunt does a nice job as his old girlfriend, who was forced to grieve for him and move on, and Nick Searcy is excellent as his friend and colleague. And so the film poses the question of identity in the end: who are we, and how much of who we are depends on those around us? Castaway brings us closer to an answer without preaching by first stripping so much away from Noland, and then giving it back.

The city is found out to be the legendary city of Atlantis. The team quickly finds out that the city doesn't have enough power for a return trip to earth. Yet the city has enough power to visit plants closer to the city they made camp at. During the their first visit to a nearby plant they discover their enemy in this TV show the wrath. The wrath is an alien species that feed on human by absorbing the life force of the human through their hand. It is discovered that the wraths technology rivaled that of the beings that built the city of Atlantis, and it is also discover that it was the wrath that wiped out the builders of Atlantis.    The main theme of the show is the battle between the wrath and the human team that went through the stargate. Although several episodes are filler and have nothing to do with the wrath. The military branch at the team is a man named Sheppard who was an air force pilot. But his is the typical tough guy but with a sociable sensitive side as well. His is capable of using his gun and also being sympathetic when it is appropriate. The over all leader of the team is a female who is a scientist and has no military training what so ever. She has step outside the traditional female gender role, she is the typical take-charge woman who feels at ease bossing men around. More then once she had to pull rank on the military leader Sheppard. There are also other side characters such as a buff mach warrior that they meet up with and join forces with. And a more feminine yet still fearsome female alien who provide valuable Intel on the nearby worlds. There is also a scientist here and there that provides comic relief.    This television show is above average ethically compared to most TV shows today. There are minimal sexual images and references. The violence is done tack fully. And the language is minimal. This TV show is geared more toward the younger sci-fi crowd. Being a break off of the hit stargate and was a hit in itself. Overall this show offered minimal points at which to critize ethically of philosophically. The people attempt to preserve life when they can. They do present some religious aspects in this show leaving it open to a transcendent being. Although their version of this being must work through theistic evolution because evolution is a theme in the scientific attitude of the show. They have mixed current scientific belief and monotheism which some have done. It was probably and attempts not to put off either side of the issue to make their viewer base as large as possible.      The none traditional female role is something that the west has strongly walked away from and it is evident in the female leaders ship of the team. Although the leader does attempt to retain a little femininity and doesn't represent any feministic ideas. Overall this is a fairly clean and more wholesome show then most today.

0316069906|2.0|My friend told me she was reading this book, and having heard her account, I decided to read the book.    It has some good elements, I liked interviews of meat factory workers by the author.  They are quite powerful stories that made me re-think my eating habit.    However, I am less impressed by the rest of the book.  Especially many episodes added by author were rather poorly written.  There were several moments, I read through the sentence -- and it ends abruptly, and wondered what, what is the point of this chapter?   Maybe author wanted to try something new.    There is a story of his grandmother, totally irreverent.  There are lots of other short episodes, not well connected and pointless.  I actually think editor should have cut the most of them and made the book 1/3 of the size, and general takeaways from the book will not change.    Well, I have to admit, the book made me think about whether I should keep eating meat produced by firm like Tyson foods, and I actually stopped doing so.  So I learned something, I recommend you get the book used or from library and just skim most part but read interview of meat factory worker part.

Orphaned and alone, he travels through the hidden passages of the station making sure the clocks run on time to avoid the notice of the Station Inspector.<br /><br />He does not like tending the clocks by himself or living alone in the station. He especially hates stealing what he needs. But if he is to finish his work, he has no choice. He has to remain invisible<br /><br />All he has left of his father is an automaton--a mechanical man--that they were trying to rebuild. Once it is complete, the automaton can be wound up and it will write a note. The boy is certain that the note will answer all of his questions and tell him what to do now that he is alone.<br /><br />The note is going to save his life.<br /><br />But rebuilding the automaton is not going to be easy. To complete him, he will need special clockwork pieces from the old man who sell toys in the station. When the old man catches the boy stealing, it seems like he will never finish the automaton or learn its secret message.<br /><br />The year is 1931. The place: Paris. In a train station in the middle of the city lives a boy named Hugo Cabret. His head is full of secrets and his story is about the begin in The Invention of Hugo Cabret: A Novel in Words and Pictures (2007) by Brian Selznick.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a lot of things. It's a bit of a book, a bit of a picture book, maybe even part graphic novel. It was the 2008 winner of the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished American picture book for children. It is 544 pages long. It is a surprisingly fast read.<br /><br />The most important thing to remember about this book is that it will not be completely different from every other book you've ever read.<br /><br />Selznick seamlessly blends pictures and words to create a story that is simultaneously literary and cinematic. Set in the era of early cinema, Selznick's illustrations capture the essence of film stills in book form. The book design is original and often stunning. That is not to say that there is anything superficial about The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Selznick brings depth to both the written and visual elements of this story.<br /><br />At the same time, The Invention of Hugo Cabret is an informative and entertaining story. Hugo's journey itself is fascinating, to have that story combined with the story of Georges Melies--one of the real pioneers of modern cinema--sets this book apart as something really special. A must read for book lovers and scholars of film and cinema alike.<br /><br />If you want to see Brian Selznick talk about the book and its inspiration you can watch the video found on the book's Amazon product page.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, You Don't Know Me by David Klass, The View From Saturday by E.

B001UV4XWY|2.0|Arthur and Norma Lewis are a young, middle class couple, living just beyond their means. Arthur is a scientist for NASA and Norma is a teacher.  But when a strange box arrives on their doorstep, their lives will change forever. A man with a severe burn that has taken away part of his face arrives to tell them about the box. In the box is a button. If they push the button, two things will happen. One - someone they don't know will die. And Two - they will receive one million dollars, tax-free.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz, but I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed her performance as Norma, who has a deformity of her own. James Marsden plays her husband Arthur with a little less intensity, but still believable. It's the story that's unbelievable.<br /><br />What starts out as an eerie, horror-like drama, soon takes a turn for a head-scratching, science fiction, mish-mash of ideas. Based on the short story by Richard Matheson, an incredible idea is unfortunately derailed in translation to film. A mater plan is revealed, along with motivation. But strange happenings such as nosebleeds, water-like doorways, and people brought back from the dead are never fully explained. I really wanted to like the film - the story and acting was intense and highly suspenseful. But in the end, I was disappointed with the bizarre, unexplained, and erratic events that added nothing to the story.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Our 3 YO daughter LOVES Miyazaki's movies. She can watch Totoro (1st edition) & Kiki's delivery over and over. (She hasn't watched Chihiro and others yet because I find them a bit scary or dark for her age).<br /><br />The beginning was a bit intriguing and scary at times so my daughter had to be in my arms (I won't complain about it) but other than that, this movie is just awesome...  Ponyo is just a cute little \\"fish/girl\\" (spitting image of Mei from Totoro) and Sosuke is an adorable 5 YO boy with a big heart. Some characters look familiar = my daughter spotted Satsuki & Mei's father. I'm glad we watched it on bluray at home because I don't know the reaction in the audience if our daughter shouted in the theater \\"Maman look, it's Satsuki's dad !!!!\\"<br /><br />The animation looks \\"simple\\" but is gorgeous. The background is amazing (the town, trees, harbor etc) and kind of made us want to live there, with Sosuke and his mom. The tsunami scene is impressive and the waves look like these old Japanese paintings of storms...<br /><br />Today is Friday, no school tomorrow, I guess tonight we'll be watching Ponyo again => YEAH !!!!

014050639X|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child.  My mom saved it (thankfully) and now I am reading it to my daughter.  I began reading it to her when she was one, she is now 15 months old and can point out most of the characters and items in the story.  I look forward to her growing older and understanding the \\"I spy\\" game, which is the point of the book.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.  It is a classic.  I buy it as a gift for the children of my friends and family.  If you are looking for a book that is the perfect length, good rhyme, great pictures and fun characters - this is it!  In regards to the review titled \\"Plot Flaw\\", yes, you are right about the Robin Hood/Wicked Witch part, but who cares.  The book is a delight and the flaw (if kids recognize it) is a great way to teach kids about making up after fighting.  Ask your child, \\"How do you think they made up?\\"      Well, I think I've made my point - this is a great book.

0735619670|5.0|I don't think yet another long review is required for this book because I consider it among the standard books that a real-world software developer should have read. To put it another way, any software developer who already internalized all of the wisdom and techniques in that book can be considered a pretty good developer and / or software team manager.<br /><br />But be careful, this book is not a how-to book and does not focus on any specific technology. You can be an ASP.NET developer working on MS Windows platform or a Python developer working on a GNU/Linux platform. If you are involved with a project that includes more than a few thousands line of code and you work as a part of a team then you owe yourself to have the knowledge described in the book.<br /><br />I think I'll create a small file that includes all the checklists that are given at the end of the chapters as well as the further reading lists and send a copy of that every junior software developer I work with.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Rarely can I see a movie repeatedly and enjoy it more and more with every showing. This is one of those movies.  I own the Juno DVD and it was one of the best investments I've made to my video collection.  Everyone I know who has seen this movie has loved it as well.  Last summer I went to France with my niece and when she got bored she watched the film on my iphone. She thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie 5 times.  The soundtrack is adorable, I have many of the songs on my ipod playlist. Ellen Page, who plays Juno shines in this role!  I cannot imagine the film without her.   I also adore every other character and the actors chosen to play these roles. The film is clearly engaging, there is no doubt about that.   I do not understand how others could give this film a less than 5-star review but to each his own.

0307266303|5.0|\\"Born To Run\\" grows, evolves, informs and entertains. It dives into science, swoops into athletic sub-cultures, visits history books and science theories.  It recounts stories of famous Olympians and other distance runners and tackles head-scratching questions about human anatomy and physiology like you're learning from a fantastic science teacher, the kind who makes you forget you're learning.<br /><br />\\"Born To Run\\" takes on a basic assumption and tears it limb from limb. Better: it pounds that assumption into the ground, takes on a corporate giant (Nike) with easy, breezy curiosity, and offers a thorough, detailed lesson about a part of our body most of us probably overlook--our feet.<br /><br />\\"Born To Run\\" is about one thing--running long distances--but it's core philosophy and value could apply to everything we do.  Everything.  It's about putting a smile back on your face, finding joy in the hardest challenge.<br /><br />I live in Colorado and used to look at the athletes who take on the Leadville 100--a 100-mile endurance run in the most rugged mountain terrain of Colorado--as athletes who needed their head examined. No more.<br /><br />Chris McDougall's writing unfurls beautifully, smoothly. The stories move from Leadville to Mexico's Copper Canyons to the California desert with ease. We meet many quirky, interesting characters along the way and we feel like we are by MacDougall's side. His style is inviting. He has a terrific way of building the book toward the powerful 50-mile run that closes the main action of the book. Some of the detours take some time, as the great \\"Neanderthal Puzzle,\\" but you return to the main trail of the book with fresh knowledge and energy.  The writing is colorful.  \\"Dental floss\\" trails. Death Valley is \\"the perfect flesh-grilling device, the Foreman Grill in Mother Nature's cupboard.\\"<br /><br />The stars of the book are Tarahumara people of the Copper Canyon and Caballo Blanco, an American who has worked and wormed his way into their world. But the star is also McDougall and his natural flair for what makes for a great story. The final scenes are remarkable, unforgettable and bring \\"Born To Run\\" full circle.<br /><br />I know I'm review #411 but...I had to chime in: what a book.so McDougall and his natural flair for what makes for a great story.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|Sometimes movies come and go in the theater within a blink of an eye. This was such the case with Law Abiding Citizen.<br />Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered during a home invasion. When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over his objections, Nick is forced by his boss to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years...The man who got away with murder is found dead, and Clyde Shelton coolly admits his guilt. Then he issues a warning to Nick -- either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family, or key players in the trial will die.<br /><br />While Law Abiding Citizen will never go down as a \\"must see film\\" in the pages of history, it does have it's moments.<br /><br />The plot, written by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Ultraviolet), is pretty as he portrays his usual fan fair of a corrupt fallible movement; however, under the skillful direction of F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job), and the acting skills of Gerald Butler and Jamie Fox, Law Abiding is actually a half-way decent film.<br /><br />While at first glance, all of the violence in the film seems unnecessary, it does help get across the message that Wimmer and F. Gary Gray are trying to get across to the audience -- that the judicial system in this country is not always what it is cracked up to be.<br /><br />The DVD video and audio quality of Overture Film's Law Abiding Citizen is pretty much standard. Grain and noise is hardly visible, while the soundtrack is crisp and clear. The extras included on the DVD contain an audio commentary, Featuring Producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel, and a few small featurettes on the film, and it's theatrical trailer.<br /><br />If your looking for a good revenge film with a bit of a message, then Law Abiding System is a good film to see.

0345495004|3.0|Loving Frank, while an interesting interpretation of Frank Lloyd Wright's and Mamah Cheney's life together, is far from satisfying in its psychological exploration of them and the times.  Perhaps it is too easy for today's historical writers to serve up subjects of historical interest to book clubs with some members members starving for the sensation that what they're reading contains more than the psychological insight of say, literary fiction.  There are those who yearn for facts or information about historical figures more than the wisdom implicit in well crafted, intelligent fiction.  Moreover, as in the case of Nancy Horan's book, we see language and a narrative thrust that are less than compelling.  While not a bad book, it is mediocre, kitchen fiction providing little insight into the complicated protagonists.  Wright emerges as a narcissist, which he may well have been, but Mamah fares no better.  While it is not essential that the reader like the main characters, in my mind it is necessary that we see in them some complexity and depth, if indeed the writer seems to imply that depth.  \\"Show us!\\" I wanted to say throughout this book.<br /><br />One of the most talented men of his generation and by Horan's account a devoted lover, Wright emerges as partially developed, perhaps a womanizer, a driven narcissist.  Mamah, a self-described ardent feminist and intellectual, presents as someone trying to justify her sexual attraction and subsequent abandonment of her husband and family.  Today most of us are tolerant of adultery and accepting of the mess it causes in the lives of those involved.  However, most feminists and intellectuals I know would not see in Mamah's voice a convincing feminist or a woman of much depth and complexity.  Rather she emerges as dominant in her personality, an adventuress and clinging woman, and a cold, remote personality in relation to all but Frank.  She is vain and shallow in that she assumes her life after leaving her family to their own devices will open up like a rare flower and that because she is aligned with one of the most fascinating men of his time that somehow doors will open for her that were previously closed.  She impresses one as a woman who watched herself step onto the stage of world events, preparing to take her place alongside those deserving of the honor of fame and fortune, but instead she finds herself justifiably scorned for what she was: an interloper and a fake.<br /><br />This is not to say that Mamah wasn't accomplished for a woman of her time.  She was educated and informed, but one can't help but wonder how feminism really affected her life since it seems more a rationalization for her irresponsible behavior than a truthful explanation for her actions.  Perhaps her dull marriage to Cheney was simply too intolerable for her to continue; perhaps she lacked the necessary inner resources to cope with her mundane life.  Of course, the charismatic Wright would sweep a vain, unhappy woman off her feet.  So what else is new?  We all know that men can do that, owning as they did then all the power, but men can also be so easily duped by an adoring woman, such as Mamah.  All this is old fodder and Horan does not impart enough insight into the attraction on either Wright's or Mamah's parts.  It is if Horan understood the relationship was a result of Mamah's boredom and a casualty of her basic rejection of the conventional roles of mother and wife as much as her sexual attraction and romantic notions.  The story is predictable, not unlike any story of adultery.<br /><br />What hits the reader so hard is the horrible fate that awaits Mamah and her children.  No foreshadowing hints at that.  It is not unlike the unpredictable destinies of serial murder victims or those in the wrong place at the wrong time when a bomb goes off.  The horrific murders and the burning of the great architectural monument to Wright's and Mamah's love are as banal and senseless as was the relationship ofthe two lovers.  Unfortunately, I could not grieve for Mamah; she didn't arouse my sympathy because I did not view her as strong, interesting or compassionate.  Instead I saw her as single minded, silly and unrepentant woman, when in fact, she should have been sorry for the devastation she caused to her husband and family, however justified she allowed it to be in her own mind.  She could have at least voiced remorse; she could have respected her ex-husband enough to communicate with him, even if she chose not to live with him.  These are elements that make her an unsympathetic character; that is fine, but we need to be convinced of her complexity if the book is to impart any insight.<br /><br />Mostly I wish Horan's language, structure and dialogue were more developed.  I felt the story unfolded in a clumsy manner, that there was too much discussion of her feminist idol and that ultimately Mamah was a boring, foolish woman not to have anticipated her isolation and rejection by society.  I'd rather read historical fiction of the likes of \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" by William Styron.  There you have psychological complexity in the characters, vivid description, fluid language, and a strong sense of place, all of which elements I did not see here.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle, Reviewer, Colorado<br />Author:[[ASIN:1440149577 Bread of Shame]]unately, I could not grieve for Mamah; she didn't arouse my sympathy because I did not view her as strong, interesting or compassionate.

There you have psychological complexity in the characters, vivid description, fluid language, and a strong sense of place, all of which elements I did not see here.

B002MBAJ4M|4.0|Govt' Mule has done a good job, as discussed in the liner notes of this album, of breaking new ground and yet staying connected with their roots.  They have employed new rhythms and kept old ones.  The same tone you are used to from the albums Gov't Mule, Deja Voodoo, The Deep End vol 1 and 2 come thru so you won't be surprised as I was when I bought their 2007 album Mighty High.  That was not an album I reviewed online, it was on a whim. Every other album I like, just not Mighty High.  I own every album they have put out except Dose.  I like the live versions better.  You will like this album.  Newcomers to Gov't Mule might like the strong guitar strumming, keyboard work by Danny Louis, and Warren Haynes Vocals.  Deep, soulful, Bluesy, and passionate music. If I were to replace my early Rolling Stones albums, this is the artist I would chose, hands down.

0061914177|4.0|Wine critic, social media star and business consultant Gary Vaynerchuk in his book explains why now is the time to \\"crush it\\" and to turn your real interests into real business by monetizing ( converting into legal tender ) on your passion and expertise. He suggests to use the power of the internet to promote yourself, your product or services by implementing a killer marketing strategy that includes building differentiated, diversified and hyper-targeted content on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and other sites that can fill the needs of passionate niche audiences. The book offers a few useful examples but at times its own content can be a little repetitive. But, worth the read.
B001QBC4AG|5.0|This was The Who's statement!  When they just were not getting airplay on AM stations in the mid sixties, they put this album out with commercials and all.  Some fine tunes here anchored by \\"I Can See For Miles.\\"  But listen to Tattoo, Relax, Sunrise, and the best version of MaryAnne with the Shaky Hands.  The commercials are classy too.  Just like listening to AM radio in the states in the sixties.<br />The themes running though the album are the precursor to the rock opera Tommy which came next in their catalog.  A must have if you are a Who fan.  This CD contains the complete expanded full version that was not found on the original vinyl LP.

B001FB4W16|2.0|As others have said, the show brings you in slowly and gets subsequently better with each episode.  The major downfall is when they try to pull it into simple HBO \\"Late Night\\" softcore drama.<br /><br />I have one major beef however.  There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that this first season should come on so many discs.  There aren't very many extras and Blu Ray discs hold more than twice the data of a standard DVD (or so we've been told).  To that end, why isn't the first season on one or two discs?  What a complete waste of the technology!

0446604844|4.0|With his thriller novel titled Total Control, David Baldacci succeeds in building up a tremendous amount of tension and intrigue in the world of high tech business takeovers.<br /><br />The protagonist, Sydney Archer, is a lawyer with a prominent law firm and she is involved in the takeover deal between the company her husband's is working for, a leading technology business, and a cash-filled buyer.  Sydney's husband, Jason is a rising executive at his company, but is involved in some secret project at his office, which keeps him busy day and night. He does not confer any details of the project to his wife, but tells her that, when it is completed, it would make all their dreams come true.<br /><br />But then suddenly Sydney's world shatters apart. Jason is reportedly killed in an air crash. At first, it seems just like an accident, but the FBI gets involved when sabotage is suspected -- and then Jason's name is linked to the sabotage and a multi-million dollar fraud scheme. Although the FBI tries to help her, but is very suspicious of Jason's recent activities, Sydney tries to solve the case on her own as she wants to clear her late husband's name. She gets pulled deeper into trouble as she gets closer to the real perpetrators, and her life is threatened. Furthermore, she has a disk with encrypted information that Jason had sent to her before his death, only she cannot decipher it and is frantically trying to find someone who can break the code for her while the antagonists are right on her heels in the process, trying to get hold of the disk themselves and stopping at nothing or no-one to get what they want.<br /><br />After many twists and turns, the story climaxes with Sydney, her young daughter and her parents in grave danger and the diligent FBI agent fruitlessly trying to come to her aid.<br /><br />I certainly liked the fast pace, the tension, the suspense and the many twists and turns in this great book, although I had a few problems with the handling of the technology (keeping in mind that the book was first published about 13 years ago). One example was where an email message appeared on a computer screen and then suddenly disappeared again -- gone forever. But for the rest, I can only comment that this thriller novel provided me with 'total' enjoyment!hat the book was first published about 13 years ago).

B000059POY|4.0|This 60's satire, treasured among cult film fans of a certain age is hard to find but still available in a crisp, widescreen transfer.  It's a feminine -- but definitely not feminist -- take on Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" as imagined through the dirty-old-man mode of screenwriter Buck Henry, and based on Terry Southern's once scandalous novel of the same name.  As the ads once said: \\"...Everybody wants a taste.\\"<br /><br />Fate sends naive, voluptuous, high-schooler Candy Christian (Ewa Aulin) on a journey of sexual discovery.  Along the way, she encounters a surprising array of big name stars (Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Marlon Brando, James Coburn, John Huston, Charles Aznavour among others), all of whom want to sample delicious, innocent Candy.<br /><br />This uneven burlesque is sometimes sweet, barely shocking, often embarrassing and worth a look at a retro genre of pseudo naughty farce.  From the perspective of the 21st century, it's a time capsule that mirrors elements of the distant sexual revolution.  It's a glossy attempt at what low budget video porn would later exploit in far more explicit, tedious, mind-numbing detail.<br /><br />Christian Marquand directed.  The music is by Steppenwolf and The Byrds!  And whatever happened to the luscious Ewa Aulin?
184744346X|4.0|Firstly this is not going to win any Pullitzer Prizes for Literature. It's not meant to either. It's just the memoirs of a loveable rogue who is who he is, has never pretended to be anything else and people love him for it. I was never a big Sabbath fan, or a fan of Ozzy's solo stuff per se, but he is a fascinating figure. How can you not be intrigued by a guy that, by all rights, should be taking the long dirt nap, but has somehow managed to survive and thrive despite himself?      Ozzy is that most singular of creatures. A true survivor. Not someone who walks around bragging about it, but a person who knows what he is, what's he's done (when his memory allows!), and the fact he's blessed to have a family that loves him as much as he loves them.     This book takes in his early life in the Aston area of Birmingham, through the early Sabbath successes and the personal devastation he felt when the band fired him. It goes through the Randy Rhodes era and, the bat, the dove, etc etc.     At parts rib-bustingly funny, insightful and melancholy, \\"I Am Ozzy\\" is as good a autobiography as I've ever had the pleasure to read. Buy it.
B002ZG98GO|5.0|I think i will agree with both the comments listed above.It was fantastic movie,iam big fan of srk & he has not disappointed me in this movie as well. The chemistry between kajol & Srk was electrifying.all the actors who had a big or small role has done marvellous job.Must watch.Dont miss it cant wait to buy dvd t keep it in my collection.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|The synopsis of the movie reminded me of the movie \\"West World\\". In \\"Surrogates\\" people of the future are living their lives through a surrogate robot, in West World people could have a western style shoot out with a robot and win ( at least they could until Yul Brenner's character robot fights back ). Both movies though, show how technology can get out of hand. Surrogates has the added twist of someone using technology to get the revenge they desire. It is futuristic but not ridiculously so like some movies in an attempt to portray the future. Overall the movie is worth the time spent watching.
B002U4UZUE|5.0|Dead quiet vinyl. Sound is very good overall with a touch too much bass. Very pleasurable to listen to. So many re-makes are not mastered correctly. This one is fine, however I have to give 5 stars to my original 1978 WB. It was engineered by Rhett Davies and it is absolutely perfect. Don't have a good copy of the original then get this re-make? It's almost as good.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Roland Emerich's best end-of-the-world film so far is a ridiculous thrill ride that is so over the top it can hardly be seriously criticized.<br /><br />The Mayan calendar has come to an end and sure enough, the world pretty much implodes.<br /><br />The quality of the digital effects is amazing (even better than the poster art!) and it's a hoot to see John Cusack out-run,  out-drive and out-fly the tectonic fracturing, the volcanic spewing and the oceanic inundation to redeem his family.<br /><br />Basically, it's the story of Noah's flood retold.  It still works.  We love our myths and will probably keep retelling them until the world ends.  Or begins again.  I missed the rainbow of promise at the end of the movie's epic flooding and (spoiler here, if you haven't read your Bible) emergence of a new land.<br /><br />This is not a movie to be taken seriously, so how can you criticize it?  The quality and scale of the effects are state of the art -- if laughable.  That is, until the San Andrea fault slips here in Palm Springs!
B0039W1J0Q|5.0|Always great to here Peter's vocals, and this album definitely features his vocal interpretations.  The orchestration adds a lot, especially on Listening Wind.  Heroes is the highlight for me... it's such a great song, but the urgency of Peter's vocals is really special.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Some are hesitant to purchase a CD unless they know at least ONE song.  Well, we didn't know ANY, and are thrilled with this music.  Great rocking beat to most of the songs.  Some songs have a hip hop/R&B flair.  Well worth this terrific price!!!
0802473164|1.0|Like a couple of other reviewers I had read the original Five Love Languages.  It is insightful and has helped me and my wife communicate much more effectively.  If you haven't read that, then by all means buy this book.  Unfortunately this book has hardly been changed from its original edition and I believe that there should be some sort of disclaimer.  Luckily Amazon accepted the return (I purchased the Kindle edition) as I reported this to them within a day of purchase.
0786868724|5.0|Loved this little book.  The contrast between the lives of the rabbi and the minister were striking.  One having faith all of his life, the other coming to faith later in life.  Yet, for both, the bottom line was serving and believing their God.  I absolutely loved the Rabbi's insight and words of wisdom.  The book was motivating and inspiring. Great, great book.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|If you are considering this DVD...let me help you...don't waste your money! Stupid plot; Stupid actors; Stupid stretches from reality. It gets two stars for the special effects.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|When you love an artist's work you trust their vision. I almost feel that no one should be writing a review right now because the music on this CD is so subtle and elusive. Only time will allow it to sink in.    Ultimately though, what Gabriel has done is an unselfish act of admiration. I'm sure he is benefiting financially, but I feel that the music on this CD is a gift to the artists who wrote these songs and nothing more.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Yes - BE VERY CAREFUL to review all discs within 30 days or you are out your over $100 hard earned money. I bought my from Amazon, now after months of watching, I find that Season 6 Part One has 2 disc ones and no disc two. Amazon reps inform me that even though they sold me a damaged package, I am out of luck...Horrible Customer Service response if you ask me as many companies will replace a damaged good far later than 30 days... shame on you Amazon ~ I WAS a very good customer..
B0012GN44U|5.0|I saw Rory Gallagher at Adelaide's Festival Theatre in 1979. This three piece blew me away and helped shape my direction as a player and a listener of blues.     He played alot from \\"Calling Card\\" that night which blew the crowd apart and help thrust this guy to the top of the perch from an adoring crowd.    This album, without pinpointing tracks necessarily, time capsules the feeling of the blues tinged 70's interlaced with hints of jazz which will last forever. The album still sounds fresh when played to unsuspecting ears.     Great Stratocaster guitar combined with the best blues voice of the era, \\"Calling Card\\" rates in my top ten albums of all time and I've listened to thousands! Buy it and enjoy the moment....
B0030BYWKK|3.0|As much as I like \\"The Courage of Others,\\" I still feel like the band could have infused more energy and passion into this recording. On most songs, I keep waiting for a solo or break in tempo that either never comes or that is just a bit less of a payoff than is warranted. That said, Midlake has created a dense, layered recording that commands attention, a quiet room, and time to just listen.<br /><br />The band's pantheistic worldscape seems alive, both both wonderful and dreadful at the same time, as though some awful and fragile balance could fail. In balance, it seems Midlake has tried to recapture the essence of the early English folk rock movement represented by iconic bands such as Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, the Albion Country Band, and Pentangle but focused on the darker spectrum of theme and music from that time, creating a recording as dreary as a foggy, rainy morning somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. That unrelenting gloom does wear down the soul eventually.<br /><br />Some of these songs have more force and resonance in the band's live performance, but now this CD mostly sits slotted on a shelf, like the 10th man on a 12-person basketball squad.
0743298039|5.0|The \\"High Expectations\\" tag is a huge burden to carry for any book. But The thirteenth Tale does not disappoint even for a moment. I subconsciously kept waiting for the moment when I would say to myself that this book is good but not as good as I heard it was. That moment never came. In fact it was so much better than I thought it would be.<br /><br />First of all, how can any book lover not love this book? With the beautiful writing and the numerous passages on libraries and books and stories and Jane Eyre, it's very difficult to disappoint. I stopped underlying phrases that caught my fancy after 20 pages. I would have ended up highlighting 50% of the book.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale starts with a letter from a very famous author, Vida Winter to Margaret who is an amateur biographer and whose father owns an antique book store. Winter does not request but orders Margaret to come to her villa so that they can start working on her biography together. She entices Margaret with the words, `Tell me the truth`. But Margaret is skeptical. After numerous false biographies of Winter already in the market, she is not sure that she'll get to know the truth.<br /><br />But she takes a chance. She reaches Vida Winter's villa and finds a frail and dying woman. As they start working towards the biography, Vida Winter spins a tale of her past. A past that is terrifying, sad and so ugly that it deserves to be kept in wraps.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale was like a roller coaster ride. It's a gothic style mystery that will keep you turning the pages late into the night. It leaves a lot of blank spaces and doubts in your mind and you start guessing and doubting and making sense of the story with Margaret.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't get was probably Margaret's obsession with her own past. I understand why her relationship with her mother is the way it is, but what I don't understand is her obsession and attachment with her twin sister whom she has never even seen. Another thing was that I thought Vida's Winter's story was purposely told in a scandalous way. The thing that Margaret discovers at the end should ideally be told with the main story itself. I don't see how you can omit that. But then that's how Vida Winters character was like. She was a storyteller and she told the story in the most interesting and haunting way she could. That's the only explanation I could come up with.<br /><br />My favorite character though was neither Margaret nor Ms. Winter. It was Aurelius, the baking giant. He was the one whom I felt most sympathy for and I was definitely satisfied with the ending that the author gave him.<br /><br />Favorite passages: (without spoilers)<br />I read old novels. The reason is simple: I prefer proper endings. Marriages and deaths, noble sacrifices and miraculous restorations, tragic separations and unhoped-for reunions, great falls and dreams fulfilled; these, in my view, constitute an ending worth the wait. They should come after adventures, perils, dangers and dilemmas, and wind everything up nice and neatly. Endings like this are to be found more commonly in old novels than new ones, so I read old novels.<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner. Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts. Inside you they work their magic.<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />My gripe is not with lovers of the truth but with truth herself. What succor, what consolation is there in truth, compared to a story? What good is truth, at midnight, in the dark, when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney? When the lightning strikes shadows on the bedroom wall and the rain taps at the window with its long fingernails? No. When fear and cold make a statue of you in your bed, don't expect hard-boned and fleshless truth to come running to your aid. What you need are the plump comforts of a story. The soothing, rocking safety of a lie.<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Our lives are so important to us that we tend to think the story of them begins with our birth. First there was nothing, then I was born...Yet that is not so. Human lives are not pieces of string that can be separated out from a knot of others and laid out straight. Families are webs. Impossible to touch one part of it without setting the rest vibrating. Impossible to understand one part without having a sense of the whole.are the plump comforts of a story.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|A man with a large family has just died, so the whole brood gathers at his home for the funeral.  Among them:  A son who feels inferior to his talented brother, a niece whose boyfriend was accidentally given a hallucinogenic drug, a lovelorn suitor, a hypochondriac, and a dwarf who has some very special photos of the deceased.<br /><br />This hysterical Britcom is everything you could hope for - a superbly witty script, naturally funny actors who play deadpan with ease, and a director who knows how to do funny.  The large ensemble cast features Matthew Macfadyen and Kris Marshall and everyone is outstanding.<br /><br />This look at craziness behind a funeral's proper façade kept me giggling from start to finish.  Highly recommended.
0553582038|1.0|Nothing exciting happens.   Almost nothing written about the interesting characters mentioned at the end of the last book.    Just a bunch of plotting by Lanisters to control everything.    I'm glad I didn't buy this book.  I wish I would have stopped at the first one.  No more Martin for me. DONE!
B002ZG98J6|1.0|Pros:  One or two redeeming acting performances, decent special effects.      Cons:  Bad casting, failure to bring the world to life, lack of creativity, complete failure to capture either the tone or the characters from the book.      Percy Jackson and his friends are racing to the underworld, desperate to get the lightning bolt in time.  As they reach Hades' residence, they are greeted by Persephone, wearing a ripped black lace, cleavage baring dress.  They ask to see Hades, but Persephone makes a few suggestive remarks and then thrusts her breasts into Grover's face.      \\"I've never had a satyr ...(long pause) ... visit before,\\" she purrs in a Spanish accent.      Grover (who has already been established as sex obsessed) is appreciative.      If this sounds like a scene that would remotely fit in with your concept of the first Percy Jackson book, then you might enjoy this movie.  If not, then stay away, because it's pretty well a snapshot of the movie as a whole.      They went for a more mature feel for the movie - not just the characters' ages, but the content reflects this.  The casting for this movie was completely wrong.  It wasn't that the acting was bad, exactly, it was just that some of the actors were completely inappropriate for the parts they were playing.  Grover is not a smooth talking, wise cracking, confident character.  Sure, the guy playing him was funny, but he wasn't Grover.  Annabeth was an even worse failure.  They kept telling us that she was smart, the daughter of Athena, etc., but we don't actually get many instances of her acting smart.  Instead, she seems like a generic tough, sexy action girl.  In fact, every female character in this movie (with the exception of the mothers) is sexualized - Annabeth, the women at the Lotus Casino, the Aphrodite girls, Medusa (who is supposed to be ugly), Persephone.  Female characters that could not be turned into sexy girls (like Clarisse) are cut from the movie altogether.  It isn't that I have a problem with action movies that are about smashing heads and meeting beautiful women, it's just that this is so not what the Percy Jackson series is about.      By making this movie about the action, the creators have really undersold the wonder and magic of this series.  I'm not a person who believes that a movie must mimic a book exactly, but there are so many missed opportunities here dealing with setting alone.  For example, in the books each of the Olympian gods has a unique throne - Poseidon's is a fishing chair.  This is something that could have been a great visual for the movie and could have been played up even more - instead the movie opts for identical marble thrones.  In Camp Halfblood, we get generic military setting instead of the unique cabins and campers.  In the Underworld, we get a generic hell instead of great details like the EZ Death line and the burnt out fields of Asphodel.  Generic is the best word to describe this movie.     There were a few good points.  The kid who played Percy Jackson really captured that character's impulsiveness and good heart despite being way too old for the role.  The special effects were okay.  Not great, but okay.      You might be wondering if this movie would be good to someone who has never read the books.  The answer is no.  It might not be such a huge disappointment, but it is still nothing more than a below average action flick.    I tried to decide if the few points of light were enough to give this movie two stars.  I concluded that they weren't, because not only does this movie suck, but it completely ruins any chance for a decent series.  If they make another Percy Jackson movie, then it will have to move away from this one completely to be any good.  1+ stars.
031606792X|1.0|I received the Twilight series as a birthday present as all my friends know I'm a Buffy fan.  I had high hopes for the books but I found them to be poorly written and absolutely God awful, especially Breaking Dawn.  I will not go into all the flaws as many readers have already enumerated them here, but I yearned for a strong, independent, non-whiny woman who wasn't constantly moping and constantly ditching her female friends.  Bella is one of the worst female characters to grace a modern book.  I wanted to smack her even in Twilight.  Her obsession for Edward reaches such a critical point that she's willing to dump all her friends, lie to her father, forgo college, become a vampire herself and wait endlessly for Edward to appear.  She also cries all the time.  I lost my patience for the characer and wished Buffy could put a stake in her.

0553381687|1.0|This book was really OK but the series is terrible. I will never pick up another Martin book.  I don't know how he can keep readers when he continually kills off all the people you care about and rewards the ones you hate.  If I wanted this type of story I would read the newspaper not a fantasy book. I borrowed the fourth book from the library and have skipped over about half of the pages trying to make it to the end.<br /><br />The bottom line is: If you like books where the good guy wins the battle and gets the girl in the end then read Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.  If you want the good guy to have his head cut off and his girl raped and murdered then read R.R. Martin.<br /><br />I would not recommend starting this series.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It combines great running form information and an interesting story.  He combines his running philosophy with humor and a compelling story.<br /><br />I have been running everything from 5Ks to Ultramarathons and Sprint to 70.3 Ironmans.  As my distances increased my stride decreased and quickened.  I was unconsciously morphing to this style of running and the mid-foot stride made all the sense in the world to me.  I had been plagued with plantar problems, shin splints and knee problems, I have further concentrated on a mid-foot stride and have had 0 aches for the last 4 months!<br /><br />If you want to improve your running and decrease injury and enjoy a good story, this is a great option for a good read.

0199535558|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

B001HN6940|4.0|It was only a matter of time before a director as visually inclined as Tim Burton would latch onto \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" quite possibly one of the most vivid and stirring fairy tales of the last century and a half. Indeed, it has given Burton whole new vistas to explore; never before has his imagination been so fully realized, so finely detailed, so delightfully eccentric. In some ways, he has been set free, the computer technologies of today's day and age having finally caught up with the vision in his mind's eye. He and his team have thoroughly created a world of phantasmagoric delights, a successful blend of live action, computer animation, and performance capture all distorted into wonderfully weird settings and characters. As an added bonus, all of this is presented in 3-D, which doesn't assault our eyes so much as envelope us, like a blanket.    The problem is that Burton insisted on creating a story. Despite the classic title, this is not an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" or \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" It's in fact, for lack of a better term, a third chapter, one that disregards Carroll's literary nonsense in favor of a generic Good vs. Evil fable. There are heroes and villains where none existed before. Alice, once just a curious little girl, is now conditioned to be a champion, which means she will go through a series of challenges before having to engage in a battle to the death. Most importantly, there's now a beginning-middle-and-end plot rather than a series of vignettes. All of this is done well, and it will play even better if a traditional story is what you crave.    But that's the thing - the story as Carroll intended it was NOT traditional. That's what made it so appealing, I think. Giving this movie a conventional storyline is sort of like providing an answer to the riddle of why a raven is like a writing desk. It takes the fun out of it.    In this version, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is a nineteen year old young woman who, after having visited Wonderland thirteen years earlier, has been plagued by strange dreams. This is of no consequence to her family or friends, all Victorian in every sense of the word - prim, proper, and snooty. They only want her to find the right suitor, and lo and behold, they have arranged an engagement party for her and her intended, the hopelessly uptight Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill). But ... what's that off in the distance? Why, it's the White Rabbit! And he's nervously tapping on a pocket watch, as if to say he's late, he's late for a very important date. Alice uses this as an opportunity to flee, and in due time, she peers into a rabbit hole, loses her grip, and falls down, down, down.    In the blink of an eye, she finds herself in a locked chamber. The only way out is through a tiny door, the key of which rests on a very large table. After a few hits and misses with a shrinking \\"Drink Me\\" potion and an enlarging \\"Eat Me\\" cake, she unlocks the door and finds herself back in Underland. Really? Not Wonderland? No. Underland. Anyway, the citizens of this world desperately need Alice's help: The wicked, big-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has overthrown her sister, the overly dramatic White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and now rules Underland with an iron fist. If Alice can obtain a magical sword and slay the dreaded Jabberwock, everything will return to normal. Unfortunately, Alice doesn't remember ever having been here, nor does she remember the many colorful residents. As far as she's concerned, this is all a dream.    Naturally, every creature or person Alice meets is strange, if not altogether insane. To start with, there's the Mad Hatter, played by Burton regular Johnny Depp. As usual, he completely disappears into his role, letting the character emerge through inhuman eyes, deranged clown makeup, a mismatched wardrobe, and a voice that alternates between a foppish lisp and a William Wallace imitation. Why the different voices? Because he's mad, Iguess. There's also Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), who look like a cross between Humpty Dumpty and Pugsley Addams. There's the sly, sneaky Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), who freely appears and disappears in a puff of smoke and lets his extra wide smile linger a moment or two more than necessary. There's the arrogant Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), the enigmatic Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman), and the March Hare (voiced by Paul Whitehouse), who's absolutely off his rocker.    There are many things about \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to praise. It's a stunning technical achievement, not only for the computer artists, but also for cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, production designer Robert Stromberg, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. The performances are decent; I particularly enjoyed Anne Hathaway, who plays the White Queen with the exaggerated poise of a Disney princess. But I have to admit, I was a little disappointed by the story. Tim Burton has taken two highly off-the-wall tales and forced them to be ordinary. I think part of the reason many of us grew up on Carroll's books is because they were anything but ordinary - all character, setting, and manipulation of logic. I can't speak for everyone, but for my money, I'd rather not know why a raven is like a writing desk.

B002Q02FS2|5.0|It's like climbing a long velvet rope sewn with golden charms and jewels. That description sums up the experience of listening to Bat For Lashes (aka Natasha Khan), even in her lesser songs. And fortunately \\"Two Suns\\" doesn't really have any lesser songs -- just a steady stream of painfully exquisite, crystalline pop that focus on the feeling of love that's gone.<br /><br />\\"In the street's broadways I seek... him whom my soul loveth,\\" she sings softly in the introductory song, before switching to a mix of tribal drums and wafting keyboard. After that, she spreads out into a string of love songs -- in fact, this entire album is pretty heavy on those. Most are bittersweet descriptions of an affair falling apart (\\"I drove past true love once, in a dream/Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed\\"), but there are some beautifully idealistic moments as well.<br /><br />Along the way, Khan dabbles in some stompy synthy dance, a hymnlike freak-folk ballad backed by a choir, and the warmly off-kilter \\"Traveling Woman,\\" and a finale that evokes old wooden stages, toy pianos and an old theatre being shut down (\\"No more spotlights/coming down from heaven... and already my voice is fading/goodbye, my dears/and into the big city...\\").<br /><br />Fortunately she doesn't abandon her signature sound, which is that of an old fantasy story mutating into a beautiful, slightly wicked dream -- swirling pop, haunting piano ballads, the soaring and unnerving echoes of \\"Siren\\" and its synth-studded companion \\"Pearl's Song,\\" ethereal melodies swathed in shimmering keyboard, and the exotic sweet danciness of \\"Two Planets.\\" But the absolute peak of the whole thing has to be \\"Daniel,\\" an catchily effervescent ode to a man with a \\"flame in his heart.\\"<br /><br />And in the deluxe edition, there are a bunch of extra tracks included -- a slow murmuring \\"Wilderness,\\" stripped-down unpolished versions of \\"Daniel\\" and \\"Use Somebody,\\" a trio of solid live performances (she sounds a bit breathless in \\"Daniel\\"), a clubby stormy remix of \\"Sleep Alone,\\" and the bleak metallic \\"A Forest.\\" Additionally, there's a documentary film about Khan and the making of \\"Two Suns,\\" which is utterly lovely visually and musically.<br /><br />One of the biggest questions that comes to mind when listening to \\"Two Suns\\" is -- why is the music industry flooded with no-talent pop hacks, when such exquisitely vibrant music is right there for the listening? It's an album with stunning vocals and instrumentation, and lyrics that evoke images of forests on fire, magicians, crystal cities, and an alter ego Khan calls Pearl (who is either a femme fatale or a fantasy traveler).<br /><br />Khan's music is, if possible, even more beautiful than before, mainly because she's managed to polish the instrumentals even further. In most songs she weaves together a shimmering wall of hauntingly silky keyboard with drums, violins, sharp beats and painfully pretty piano, but sometimes she also pares it down to the bare essentials (\\"Peace of Mind\\"). In the lo-fi rendition of \\"Daniel,\\" the music is even more beautiful because it's still lovely when stripped down.<br /><br />But Khan's voice is one of the loveliest things in this album -- she can sing powerfully or wistfully, and she even shows that she can manage a song almost a capella (\\"Peace of Mind\\" again). Her songwriting is even better: she can conjure powerful emotions with vivid swathes of words (\\"I drove past true love once, in a dream/Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed\\").

B0031S4K5E|5.0|I reluctantly watched this movie last year. I loved it and had to have it. I made my boyfriend watch it too, and he also loved it. Ponyo is heart warming, and she is adorable.   The plush is soft and feels great to touch.  I watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles, so the English version of the movie is strange to me. It seems to me that they changed the words a lot, so it takes away from the original feel.   Still, this is one of my favorite movies.

0061020680|3.0|Earlier this year, I have started to re-read Pratchett again, hoping to refresh my memory and to catch-up with some of the newer titles. I have gotten as far as Mort up 'till now (have tons of other stuff to read), and by now everything was as I remembered it do be. First two books of Discworld series are deconstruction of fantasy paradigm, hilarious in it's moments but hardly anything more than that. Third book introduced us with Granny Weatherwax and notion of headology and just for that it stands out from the crowds, but is hardly more than story about equality between genders. Fourth book i.e. Mort, took a grasp on somewhat bigger scale. It took Death as it's main character, provided different viewpoints on matters of life and death from diverse characters, and gave us a few more insights about the exact manner in which Ankh-Morpork functions. Rincewind has sort of a cameo here, faculty staff and Shades have noted appearance, and rest of it is sort of a colorful background for an exercise in metaphysics. Ideas of justice, death, destiny and fairness are all being explored on these pages, as does the notion of power. And now we have a problem.<br /><br />I remember reading \\"Reaper man\\" as a sort of an allegory that contrasted the pastoral picture of an English village with modern-day consumeristic frenzy of big town and it's inhabitants. Now in it, Death as a character has more profound depth than in Mort were it is presented as a mere function - \\"Destroyer of the worlds\\" (etc.), ultimate reality who happens to have sense of humor. Now, upon reading \\"Mort\\" again, I look differently upon the events and ideas from \\"Reaper man\\". Because \\"Mort\\" is all about balance, The Way Things Are Supposed To Be, in which anything that disrupts this preordered scheme is instantly judged as a destructive force that should be banished from existence. You can't mess with a higher purpose and the final way, because if you do, all sort of bad things could happen. Now, that is all well and correct if this higher purpose is something to be admired, something we should strive for. But, as Death constantly repeats - \\"There is no justice, there is just me\\". And doesn't this sound pretty conservative and totalitarian in the same moment?<br /><br />If we change the meaning of Death and put a word 'system' instead of it (and as far as it may sound farfetched, the notion of death being the final frontier is the systematic notion) than the entire novel suddenly transforms itself into an apology of the system. Individual cannot mess with it and if he does the entire thing falls apart and we can't have that can we? In the end system can be benevolent but only if he chooses to be so, it cannot be forced or manipulated, and its benevolence is some kind of merciful approach to weaknesses of the individual. This idea is the disturbing one, the idea that advocates status quo and disqualifies any attempt towards any kind of the change. Suprisingly, many of the Discworld novels, chose to make ridicule of that kind of totalitarianism (e.g. Equal rites), and seeing it rise between these pages is troubling thought indeed.<br /><br />\\"Mort\\" is still Discworld in a way - With funny remarks, great observations on ways that make people go, the absurdities of life and it's rule, and everything else that makes the continuing story of Discworld so good - but in the same way it's a strange Discworld, one that I'm not comfortable in, and one that I wouldn't want to be a part of. Maybe this musings are too abstract, but the feeling of dread that overcame me was factual and unsettling. Wonder what lies in store with upcoming books. This new way of looking at stuff seems promising enough. After all, we should always question the ideas we had at some point of our life. I'm questioning \\"Disworld\\".

B000002B7M|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's legendary debut `Blizzard of Ozz' is now thirty years old which is unbelievable considering this record was one of the cornerstones of heavy metal's revival in the Eighties. The story of Ozzy's comeback after his exit from Black Sabbath has been well documented as well as his competition with his old band which was quite heated during this era. It is safe to say that while Sabbath held there own with Dio at the mike there is no question which act triumphed in the end. Fortunately for Ozzy, the success of his first two records set the tone while later LP's were not as consistent. Obviously a huge key to the success of those records was the contributions of the late Randy Rhoads and the origins of his partnership with the Oz have been told ad nauseum in other forums so I won't recount them here. What I will say is that Randy's playing since the days of Quiet Riot to `Blizzard' improved dramatically. In fact the two Quiet Riot records were something of a disappointment and it is hard to believe this is the same man! Randy was nothing short of a visionary in his playing on the first two Oz records and it is here that his reputation was built and well deserved. Several players had brought classical music styles to heavy rock (Ritchie Blackmore most notably) but Randy's sound was unique. So many classic songs that have become rock mainstays litter this record including \\"Crazy Train\\" which is without a doubt Ozzy's most lasting contribution to pop culture, \\"I Don't Know\\", \\"Mr. Crowley\\" and \\"Suicide Solution\\" (the last two considerably controversial, the latter the subject of a lawsuit). It is no surprise that `Blizzard of Ozz' is Ozzy's most celebrated and successful recording and a true milestone in what would to be a golden age for metal.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|When watching a movie by Quentin Tarantino there are certain things one comes to expect.  This movie provides most of them.    1.  Large amounts of blood and violence.  This movie is very violent.  If you want to see people brained with batch, scalped and slashed to a point where it attempts to desensitize you then this is the picture for you.    2.  Interesting Villains:  Tarantino's film got a lot of good press in Germany, mostly because it portrays Germans and Nazi in a much more sympathetic way then we have seen.  We see men conflicted by killing, unwilling to save their own lives to compromise others.  As for the primary villain although his own evil is established early he is portrayed more as a German Holmens than a simple Nazi slaying Jews.    3.  Violent Heroes:  The Americans in this movie are very violent as are their allies, they are Jews getting revenge and they aren't shy about getting it.    4.  Offbeat comedy:  A lot of what happens is presented in a comical fashion.  You will find yourself laughing at times that will surprise you.    If these elements are not to your liking, you won't care for the film, if they are you will enjoy it.    and might I add the ending totally surprised me.

B001HN694K|3.0|There was quite the schism when Tim Burton remade [[ASIN:B000BB1MI2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]].  Some felt like he'd injected a much needed dose of modern madness to Dahl's tale of Kids Behaving Badly.  Others felt like he'd bastardized an already [[ASIN:B0009FGWN0 pitch perfect film]] by making the whole thing acidic and aggressive.  He made the factory grander, weirder, and far more unsettling, and he took Gene Wilder's impishly subdued Wonka and made him into a twitchy germaphobe with creepy teeth.  I found it difficult to compare the two films, because it seemed like they were trying to do two completely different things.  The first film was about childish wonder and the fine line between growing up and growing old.  The second film was about daddy issues and the dangers of drug abuse.  I think.<br /><br />Burton's next big remake, ALICE IN WONDERLAND suffers from the same division of purpose.  In fact, it would be far better if the film had been billed as a sequel.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND II: BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME.  Alice is no longer a precocious and curious child, and when she falls down the rabbit hole this second time, she realizes that she misheard the name of the place when she was younger.  It's not called Wonderland.  It's called Underland.  Burton is known for his darkness, and that name change gives you a good idea of just where Burton applied most of the strokes of his grim, black brush.  The effect is contrary to what most people (fans of the original, for sure) will be expecting from the film.  The original was about the wonder and beauty of a child's imagination; this film is about the dreary blackness of control.<br /><br />Of course, the original Wonderland had its dark sides (not the least of which being a queen with a penchant for beheadings), but those dark sides were the unavoidable shadows you got from all the loony brightness that dripped from the trees or exploded from the ground (or just appeared out of thin air).  What Burton has done is take all that background menace and bring it straight to the fore, so that the wonder and enchantment take a backseat to the film's angry (and rather dull) plot.  What we have here is a Wonderland -- excuse me; I mean Underland -- that is steadily decaying under the rule of its Machiavellian queen (\\"It's better to be feared than loved,\\" she mutters, a copy of [[ASIN:0979415403 The Prince]] surely hidden beneath her dress).  According to a prophetic scroll, Alice must return and restore order to the world by dispatching of the queen's barbarous pet, the Jabberwocky (a beast lifted from a few of Carroll's poems).<br /><br />Wonderland as Carroll described it was always distinctly amoral.  It sprawled and seethed and pulsed with chaotic color.  Burton's Underland is all about justice and slavishness and it hisses with murky moodiness.  Instead of having a Mad Hatter of dizzying antics and baffling wordplay, you now have Depp's (oddly Scottish) Hatter, a man who is less mad than he is bi-polar.  One minute he is railing against the queen and crying for rebellion, the next minute he's sadly melting into himself as if struggling with senility.  He shares the screen with the excessively plastic White Queen (Anne Hathaway cheesing it up big time) and the encephalitic Red Queen (played by an emotionally mute Helena Bonham Carter; she uses about as many facial expressions as an actual deck of cards, and I never once believed her when she called for yet another person's head).  The only character who really lights up the screen is, of course, the Cheshire Cat, and even his psychotic omnipresence is neutered by the film's insistence on rules (I CANNOT believe a character actually claimed there were rules in Wonderland!) and structure.<br /><br />There's no real plot to Carroll's tale, and that was part of its beauty and charm.  Burton's movie, on the other hand, is what you get when people pretend that madness is supposed to make sense.  Although it doesn't need to besaid that Burton has created a visually arresting tale (the 3D mostly a so-so addition), he hasn't done anything to enchant the mind or heart.  He has instead replaced Carroll's whimsy with bellicose dreariness, and he's supplanted the frivolity with your basic (and boring) movie morals: Believe in yourself!  Don't back down from adversity!  Enslave the Chinese with the opium trade!<br /><br />Forget I said that last part.  I'm not sure what it has to do with the movie, unless it's Burton's way of slapping himself in his own face.  You won't get the reference unless you see the film to the very end anyway.  If you do, then you might find, like I did, that this final moment of the movie makes the preceding bits all the darker.  It proves that, although fun in all the most obvious ways, Burton's film still lacks charm, grandeur, and the kind of loony and limitless innocence that makes Wonderland a place anyone -- young or old -- would ever want to visit.isually arresting tale (the 3D mostly a so-so addition), he hasn't done anything to enchant the mind or heart.

1595478728|5.0|In this classic Catholic apologia Chesterton makes a reasoned case for Christian faith. Not from the view of religion but from the view of a man in search of religion. In fact he begins with the story of a yachtsman that sets sail and because of a series of miscalculations unwittingly finds himself back where he began delighted in his accomplishment and amazed at the things he discovers there.<br /><br />Along the way Chesterton dismantles the dominate ideologies of his day, equating those that are unable to believe as nothing more than inmates in the asylum. He also shows how it is the paradoxes of religion that non believers find so troubling that are at the core of truth. Truth summed up in the Apostles Creed.<br /><br />It is not a book for the faint of heart as his rhapsodic and metaphorical style takes more than a few reads to unravel. It was however a challenging but fruitful read and I believe that if catechism class had been as enlightening many a Catholic would not have had to take the same voyage as Chesterton.

If Sade needed validation of the love of her fans, I think she has it now.<br /><br />Sade Adu does one thing, and does it extremely well.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  When you buy a Sade album, you know you can expect certain things:  minimal but meaningful lyrics; vocals delivered with subtle emotion and dignity; and music with exotic overtones.  This album has just enough contemporary studio production to make it relevant, but Sade's sound remains intact.  The title track is the one that could have success as a single, with its strong beat and echo of early hip-hop.  It is not characteristic of the album as a whole.  The other tracks are more mellow, and will not disturb those who don't like their adult contemporary music to be too \\"busy\\".  My least favorite track is \\"Babyfather\\", which leans toward reggae (not my favorite genre), but even that one is saved by its depiction in the lyrics of love at first sight that outlasts the test of time.  I would not be at all surprised to find this album receiving a Grammy nomination as Album of the Year.
0061703257|4.0|This book is intriguing, fast paced, thought provoking, and nearly impossible to put down.  I noticed some reviewers (who apparently read WAY too many fictional thrillers) over-analyze the plot, needing something more plausible, or the character development, wanting something much deeper.  While that may have made it more interesting for the more 'complex' reader who takes their thrillers oh so seriously, it wasn't necessary.  We get an ultimately original noir-paranoia plot, a minor lesson in psychoanalytics and mental illness, and a fun twist, even if it is suspected at the base of your spine.  Buy it, read it in 4 hours, and let yourself enjoy it.  Then watch the movie to see how it stacks up.  (I'm very curious to see how it matches up with the book, and you will be too!)
B002YOKVU4|5.0|Does this movie need a review. This movie is hands down one of he greatest of Its time.  If you choose to watch it on  blu-ray, well spark a candle, dim the lights, and pick your poison; Not that you need all that for the show, but once you get into locked a serious movie collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I've never seen/read Twilight nor did I know that the Vampire Diaries was based on a series of tween books. I, generally, try to stay away from those kind of \\"kid\\" versions (I'm more the Tru Blood type). Anyway, I decided to give V Diaries a shot and I'm so glad I did.    Vampire Diaries is a guilty pleasure. Despite the fact that the series is set-up with the high school crowd, it definitely has a more adult feel to it with the complex issues that come up and the dark, edgy violence. The first couple of eps played a bit too 90210(ish) but then the series really took off.     The main characters are well rounded and believable even in unbelievable situations. The series has managed to weave a set of relationships that breath life into each of the characters. Elena is the high school girl who must not only face personal tragedy but a new boyfriend (Stephan) that may or may not be what he seems. And Stephan has his own family issues with his bad boy brother, Damon. And while Damon is definitely bad (body count anyone?)he has reasons he believes are valid for the pain he inflicts.(mostly)    Elena as played by Nina Dobrev is a smart girl with a compassionate heart who definitely doesn't put up with any BS. In this vampire tale she doesn't just automatically tell Stephan it's all right when she finds out his secret. It's not cool that he's a vampire. People die around him and that's not ok. They fall in love despite his being a vampire rather than because of it.    Stephan Salvatore, Mystic Falls resident brooding vampire, started out (to me) a little too much like an Angel wannabe but Paul Wesley has done a competent job in opening the character up. What he does to Damon in the basement was truly chilling. I was like, HEY!, aren't you supposed to be the good guy!    And last but not least of the lead characters, Damon. What can I say. Damon is just delightfully bad. Ian Somerhalder plays him with relish. In the wrong hands, his character could have easily become a cliche but the actor has turned him into someone you just can't help but feel for (equal parts sympathy and revulsion)as he struts his way around, doling out cruelty with a smile, all the while hiding a secret of his own.    The supporting cast is also just wonderful in their roles. Kudos especially to Candice Accola for her portrayal of Caroline Forbes. The whole cast was well chosen and that they're all beautiful and sexy doesn't hurt either.    Anyway, before this review becomes a novel... just watch a few eps. I dare you not to get hooked on it.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|The music on this album is awesome. This is some of my favorite Metallica music. I like the sound, the mixing, the EQ, all that is good. What is NOT good, is the fact that much of this album is totally distorted to the point where it becomes unpleasant to listen to. I cannot give this album the 5 star rating it deserves because of this.<br /><br />This is not the only album to suffer from this condition. It seems that almost every album I buy these days is rampant with distortion. This is NOT ok. The music industry needs to fix this, or people are seriously going to stop paying ANY amount of money for this crappy sound.<br /><br />I don't want to blame Metallica for this, or bad talk Metallica for the production, but someone needs to do something. This industry wide practice of bad sound has got to stop. The only way to get heard is to speak up, and that's what we all need to do.

B0039W1J0Q|5.0|There are very few artists that could pull this off and have it end up sounding so deep, emotional and real. So many of us lead hecktic lifes where the pace is nuts and everything is technology, technology and electronics. I'm a musician and make my living with a computer and a recording studio of electronics. People can make amazing albums in their iBook and headphones. You can't make this album with an iBook and headphones. Incredibly well recorded orchestra, piano and Peter retelling songs that many of us loved the 1st time around but with a very different twist to them is wonderful... listening to these wonderful tracks slows the world down and helps me feel grounded. Believe me, this isn't the last album like this - many times, Peter has established something in his recordings that has gone on to be repeated many times over by other artists.<br /><br />All I can say is well done, Peter and thank you for continuing to being different in a world where everybody wants everybody to sound like something from the past.<br /><br />- John \\"Skippy\\" Lehmkuhl

B0021L8UPS|4.0|Evil kid movies are inherently creepy. Kids are supposed to be victims in movies not the other way around, so when you do see it it makes your skin crawl. This is a good entry into the genre.    A couple adopts a girl from an orphanage. Things seem to be OK in the beginning but deteriorate at a rapid pace.    The strength here is in the way the story unfolds. We meet a seemingly happy, loving couple, but as things progress we see their dark sides and weaknesses. The viewer gets glimpses of infidelity, alcoholism, mental instability, et al. Same with their adopted girl. Certain flags pop up right away, but they get larger and larger with each passing scene.     There are weaknesses as well. I like Peter Skarsgaard, but he's weak here and I can't say it's in the script. He just isn't all there. Vera Farmiga, on the other hand, does a great job. Her realization of what is happening and the subsequent trying to impart it to those around her is an uphill battle, particularly given her less than stable past. But she really sinks her teeth into it and displays the whole \\"deep love of a mother\\" thing with resounding aplomb.     The other major weakness is the climax/ending. The storyline is laid out very well until then. And outside of the really creepy transformation of the orphan, it's like the writer(s) got stupid all of the sudden and put this unbelievably heavy handed machine into motion. I won't spoil things here but this part of the movie needed to be much smarter and way more clever. It's bad to the point of nearly negating all the cool stuff that came before. Maybe the producers listened too closely to their test audiences.     This is a generally good movie with good work in front of and behind the camera. Ending not withstanding, it's well worth the viewer's time investment.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|I love Pink and her brand of music.  Probably would  have just paid per download of the songs that I knew I liked but I thought the whole album would be better.  A little disappointed in some of the slow songs.  I don't always associate Pink with slow ballads.  But still worth having for the songs that I do like.
0307269752|2.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has received some new attention in America cause of the imminent release of a very well regarded film adaptation.  The book has seemed dimilarly well regarded.  However, I found it to be something of a disappointment.<br /><br />At the heart of the book there's an interesting mystery.  Harriet Vanger, the young member of a family of industrialist misanthropes with Nazi tendencies, disappears off of her families isolated island home in the midst of a family retreat, her body is never found.  Forty years later her aged uncle hires disgraced journalist Mikael Blomquist to make a last stab at finding out what happened to her.  He eventually comes to be helped by a young punk hacker and freelance private investigator, Lisbeth Salander.  The mystery is an interesting one, although the general solution to it will be an obvious option for most readers.  Blomquist describes it as a \\"locked room murder mystery on an Island\\" since a series of events prevented anyone from getting to or from the island at the time the girl disappeared.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Larson isn't a very good writer.  Perhaps some of this is simply a fault of the English translation.  The Swedish version may be far more lyrical in presentation.  However there are other problems.  One of them is the framing device.  It takes over a hundred pages before Blomquist really begins to work on the case of the missing girl.  Much of this hundred pages is spent delving into minute detail about Blomquist's fued with a corrupt industrialist.  A feud which resulted in Blomquist being convicted of criminal libel.  Furthermore the fate of Harriet Vanger is revealed with about another hundred pages to go.  Those pages are used in a very boring and self congratulatory telling of how Blomquist resolves the feud.  Larson is a journalist, a magazine editor like his hero Blomquist, and it's clear that he's living out some of his own fantasies here of the crusading journalist who makes good and changes the world.  These sections also serve as a clearinghouse for some of Larson's gripes about the nature of the media, particularly financial reporters, in Sweden.  All of this makes for rather boring reading.  If Larson wanted to write a story about financial journalism then that is one thing.  The mini series State of Play did a fantastic job of delivering an engaging story about newspapermen at work.  Yet here it comes off rather dull, tedious, and over detailed.<br /><br />Furthermore many of the characters are very thinly sketched.  We learn a little bit about Blomquist, but not too much.  Other than his on-again-off-again relationship with his married publishing partner there's nothing unusual about Blomquist.  We're not shown that he's particularly brilliant or talented or diligent and we're not given access to any real hopes, desires, dreams or demons he might have.  He just seems to exist.  In the hands of a more skilled and thoughtful writer this might be workable as a theme.  Various stories have involved discussions of very ordinary and uninvolved people.  But that doesn't happen here.  Blomquist has a desire to see his magazine return to profitability and respectability and would like to get revenge on his rival Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, but it doesn't seem to dominate his life.  The apparent destruction of his journalistic career seems to inspire neither rage or nor any great sadness in him.  He merely accepts it. At his libel trial Blomquist never puts up a defense, something that a number of characters ask about, and this is indicative of the character as a whole.  He never seems to do much or react to much.  Again, in more skilled hands this might mean something as we might explore a Blomquist who is dead but comes alive over the course of the novel.  But this doesn't exist.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, the second protagonist, is more thoroughly sketched.  A punk computer hacker, she is a ward of the state who makes her money doing freelance private investigating work.  Salander, while a talented hacker, is antisocial in the extreme, and filled with rage at the world around her.  She's described by one character as being \\"the perfect victim\\" and clearly was the victim of some sort of horrible mistreatment.  The problem with Salander is that she's too well sketched.  Or rather, that Larson spends enough time describing her antisocial side and no time describing any other side.  I found myself coming out of the novel with a deep loathing for Salander.  For instance, she is someone who is fanatical about her own personal privacy, erecting boundaries that she refuses to let others cross, but who thinks nothing of snooping into the lives, and computers, of others.  Larson also portrays her as a complete misanthrope, and yet there's the sense that we're supposed to agree with her when she thinks other people are idiots for wanting to do things differently than her.  Inexplicably a number of characters also seem attracted to her, either romantically or paternally, or, creepily enough in a novel that has major themes about sexual violence against women, both.  Yet we're never shown why anyone would like Salander or tolerate her presence for more than a few minutes.  The only times I felt any connection to her was when she violently punished some rapists.  Finally, there's another creepy aspect.  Salander ends up in a sexual relationship with Blomquist, a man many years her senior and who is obviously a stand in for the author.  In a book which deals with themes of the sexual exploitation of, and violence against, women, it's rather creepy that the author would involve a fictionalized version of himself in a relationship with a rape victim who is young enough to be his daughter.  And the relationship with Blomquist seems to be based on nothing.  Salander is portrayed as a thorough misanthrope who hates most people instantly.  Yet she likes Blomquist for no real reason.  There's no clear indiciation of why we, or Salander, should consider Blomquist any different from anyone else whose path she has crossed, especially her boss Dragan Armansky who is portrayed as nearly identical to Blomquist in that he has both a fatherly and a sexual interest in Salander.<br /><br />There's also things that get left out.  The pacing of the mystery is a bit off.  When it begins to get cracked open it cracks open very rapidly.  At the same time there's extended passages about rather mundane things.  Do we really need to know every step Blomquist takes and every person he talks to in tracking down someone who took a picture on the day the crime took place?  Also, we don't get a lot of development of the victim herself.  Despite being the center of the novel, and the obsession of her uncle for forty years, she's pretty much a cipher.  The novel also, by casting a serial killer as one of the main players, ironically perhaps gives a distorted impression about violence against women since most women who are subjected to violence are not the victims of sadistic strangers, but rather men who they know.  Finally, there's an interesting thread that Larson doesn't really do anything with.  Both Blomquist, Salander, and the killer who they track down, are investigators of a sort: Blomquist a reporter, Salander a private investigator and personal snoop, and the killer a serial kidnapper who methodically stalks and investigates his victims.  Yet this idea is left unexplored.  There's no real investigation of what investigation means to these people.  Of why they feel drawn to finding things out and solving mysteries.  Also, for a book which is, on many levels, fundamentally about violence against women (the original Swedish title is \\"Men Who Hate Women\\", the novel doesn't really discuss much about the nature of violence against women or patriarchy in society.  It's presented more as a catalog of horrors.alander, while a talented hacker, is antisocial in the extreme, and filled with rage at the world around her.

B000J0UD94|2.0|As a middle school teacher I screen movies for classroom use, and I was hoping to find something about Columbus that was suitable. This is surely not it. On the down side, this is a very violent and gory film, so much so I was not even interested myself in extended scenes of gore. Much of the historial reason and context for these conflicts is even unclear, so the violence is much more meaningless.     As a former archaeologist, historian, and 18th century reenactor, I certainly do appreciate the incredible attention to realism and detail the producers went to re-create the realistic world of Columbus. Yet, for all the gore, I would not watch this again.    The details of the sea voyages were essentially skipped over, though some of the most beautiful footage is of Columbus' Nao and the other two ships in full sail, but we get about two or three minutes of this. The action jumps from Spain to America and back again by land, so the importance of the voyages themselves are missed as a transitional piece.     The acting is generally dull. These are big name actors, so it seems they are uninspired by an uninspiring script. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the writers took what could have been a compelling adventure story and reduced it to a drab and humdrum realism. I don't think Columbus would have agreed that his experiences were in the end all about meaningless violence and dull realism. After all, he was the one who laid claim to a share of all the Americas' wealth as its discoverer.    At times I felt I was watching a second sequel flop of \\"The Mission,\\" a far, far more compelling and better written film. Both films dwell very similarly on the exploitation of the native peoples, but at least The Mission explains very thoroughly all the colonial forces at work behind that in a clear and compelling way. Still, I don't recommend the Mission for middle school audiences. High School perhaps, and then, the upper grades.[[ASIN:B00003CXBH The Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]

B001KEHAI0|5.0|I doubt director Harold Ramis ever set out to deliberately make the perfect Zen movie, but he did. Bill Murray plays a cynical weatherman doomed to live out the same mundane day over and over again. Anyone who's ever held a regular monotonous job or been stuck in any kind of repetitive rut can identify with that, right? Plus, it's Bill Murrary, for crying out loud. He IS the Everyman. But what finally snaps him out of this `doomed' existence? One day, perhaps day 1,002, he finally tries a different attitude and decides to embrace every single moment of the day no matter how banal or excruciating (an insurance salesman!), and that shift - to embrace each moment - is what ultimately delivers him from his `hell' on Earth. It doesn't get more Zen than that. But the fact that enlightenment arrives in the form of this goofy comedy instead of some inscrutable Buddhist koan is what makes it ... perfect.
0670021652|1.0|I loved Eat, Pray, Love.This book was a big disappointment.It is one of the most self-indulgent books I have ever read.It's like Gilbert was told to right another best seller, and it just didn't work.Maybe she is one of those authors who only has one best seller in her.I probably wouldn't have read the whole book, but I was reading it for a book club.The book club was canceled because no one liked the book and put it down.I wasted a lot of time reading a book that just wasn't worth it.On the positive side (and I'm digging deep) there were some moments when Gilbert fell into her great story telling about herself.The other stuff is something right from a Marriage and Family text book I had in college.I wasn't looking for research studies...looking for a story to get lost in.I will definitely read another book of hers if she gets back into a story with a great plot.
1577312082|5.0|There's nothing new about the concept \\"be here now.\\" We've all heard a hundred variations of this theme from self-help books to religious texts, and from mystics to little league coaches. But for those of us either blessed or cursed with a rational mind, this book speaks clearly, profoundly, and easy-to-grasp. Hell, even Oprah `got it.' Once you understand that all fear is your mind's projection of an outcome, event or piece of information that isn't even real yet, you start to get a sense of the forces within ourselves that trap or hold us back from truly enjoying any given moment. I read this book again and again whenever I feel stuck. Or I listen to the CD to get a good laugh, because Tolle reads the book himself, and he must not have been happy with the sound of his own voice because he had the tape slowed down to give him a lower, more ominous pitch. It's a little bit creepy, but surprisingly effective, and it never fails to crack me up.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Let me say right off that Rose Tyler is my favorite of all the Doctor Who companions.  However, there's something almost indescribably unique about Donna Noble: she's like the synthesis of all Doctor Who companions.  She's more mature than anyone since Barbara, the first Doctor Who companion. Yet she's also seductive, but not in a sensual Rose Tyler or Martha Jones kind of way; more like Tegan or Nyessa - or, once again, like Barbara from the William Hartnell years.  And the stories themselves have a more mature quality, in that Donna and the Doctor seem as much like tourists on an extended vacation as time-travelers moving from one adventure to another.  Donna never loses her cool or wanders off the way Rose often did; and she never doubts that she's made the right decision to accompany the Doctor.  Though the Second Season is my favorite Doctor Who season and Christopher Eccleston my favorite of the new Doctors (William Hartnell remains my all time favorite Doctor), this one - the Fourth Season - stands as much the quintessential Doctor Who Season as Donna Noble does the quintessential Doctor Who companion.
B000A6CLL0|1.0|I am a big Star Trek fan and watched all series and movies and read also a lot of books. ENT is clearly the worst Star Trek series but however there are some good episodes in the first two seasons.<br /><br />It is the first season of ENT with Star Trek in the title but this season is a betrayal of Star Trek. Capt. Archer tortures a prisoner, steal a Warpcore from friendly Aliens and did a pre-emptive strike against other Aliens. This is not Star Trek!!!<br /><br />Therefore spend your money and your time for TOS, TNG, DS9 or VOY but not for this rubbish.

As time has gone on, the character development has been great, and the writing is consistently good.  As a professional physicist, I am also intrigued by the accuracy of the science.  I have recommended the show to many non-scientists, and most have become hooked.  It is great to have the DVD with commercial-free episodes.

0307271862|3.0|This is my first venture into reading books by Henning Mankell, having been introduced to his Kurt Wallander detective by Kenneth Branagh who played him on Masterpiece Mystery. While \\"The Man from Beijing\\" has some substantial flaws, his sharp writing style kept me going despite a rather implausible and disjointed plot.<br /><br />Scandinavian authors have a great track record for writing thrilling mysteries. Examples include \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" by Peter Hoeg, \\"The Laughing Policeman\\" by Maj Sj&ouml;wall and Per Wahl&ouml;&ouml;, and \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" by Stieg Larsson. Mankell is no exception. The opening scenes revealing a brutal massacre of almost an entire village are riveting and truly chilling. Mankell maintains the ominous sense of impending danger throughout the book.<br /><br />My biggest problem with \\"The Man from Beijing\\" is that the motive for the killings is totally implausible. While I am writing this review before reading the last 20 pages (so as not to inadvertently reveal that the butler did it), the likeliest scenario is revealed early on and a large section of the book would be totally pointless if it turns out that I'm wrong.<br /><br />Sometimes respected authors succumb to the temptation to mount the soapbox and use their positions as authors to expound on social issues that are important to them. This temptation should usually be resisted as the results seldom result in quality work. I believe this is the case with \\"The Man from Beijing\\". Mankell lives part-time in Mozambique and is certainly aware of the Chinese economic encroachment that is going on in much of Africa. While this may be an important issue, trying to link it to the fictional massacre of Swedish villagers creates a discordant mishmash of themes and plotlines that only someone with Henning Mankell's talent could even hope to salvage. Salvage it he does, though, as I still look forward to reading the Kurt Wallander books.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|I'll be the first to admit I am a special effects fan.  And I do like a film with a story line that is \\"out there\\". In those two respects 2012 keeps one's attention throughout.  But don't use any brain cells to delve into the story line itself.  You'll be amused and disappointed.  For example, try to imagine what the world's oceans are going to be like in the aftermath of such flooding.  Sorry for the facts here.  Add in billions of animals and billions of human beings all drowned and decomposing nearly at the same time and rate and you have a toxic goo that going to the Cape of Good Hope will NOT solve. To survive in THAT aftermath; that would be a story.  Ugh.  To create a film that tells the story of the end of the world as we know it and then to end it as the film makers did is lazy.  Just plain lazy.  I think they could have come up with a more imaginative and realistic ending than they did.  BUT other than that I was entertained.  And I would watch it again.  One more thought though.  What are we becoming when a film is portraying millions of people dying horribly, the scene in L.A. or in D.C. are two examples, as the backdrop to a small group of characters. That is troubling

B000E41MRC|4.0|An epic-scale \\"production\\" of the 1934 Nuremberg rally, director Leni Riefenstahl's infamous \\"Triumph of the Will\\" manipulates reality to glorify Adolf Hitler and his frightening power. Since \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is a star vehicle, Riefenstahl makes certain that the f&uuml;hrer gets the best closeups.  As the film progresses, Hitler's vanity becomes ludicrous (he always is aware of the cameras), yet there is a dark undercurrent that lies beneath his self-conscious posing. When first released in 1935, many German moviegoers no doubt watched \\"Triumph of the Will\\" in a hypnotic trance and succumbed to its grotesque Nazi mythology; worse yet, they believed. The Nazi \\"death machine\\" was in motion, gaining public support in its obsessive quest to annihilate the Jewish population. Riefenstahl seemingly covers all the rally events in her two-hour Nuremberg chronicle, yet the overall impression is a big-budget distortion of history. Despite its undeniable cinematic impact, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" survives as a cautionary tale for future generations.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I must admit, at first i bought this movie because Robert Pattinson was in it. However, after watching it, i fell in love with it, with the actors who portrayed each character so well. I have read way too many negative comments about this movie, ranging from the small budget to the bad acting. I honestly don't see it, i think this movie is great. It touched me in a way that made me want to learn more about Federico Garcia Lorca and Salvador Dali so much that i bought any book i could gather about their lives and work. I would also love to go to Spain to visit the cities where these two great artists grew up.<br />Like i said i'm completely fascinated with their lives. After reading so many books about them i still can't get enough.<br />We all have different tastes about movies but i think everyone should give it a try. It's sad this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved.

0812550706|1.0|Most reviewers seem to have really enjoyed Ender's Game. Others, such as myself, didn't care for the book at all. What's amusing is that when negative reviewers express bewilderment at all the rave reviews, the enthusiasts often respond by accusing those who didn't like the book of being narrow-minded, etc. But I really don't think narrow-mindedness is the problem. I've found that most of the complaints generally boil down to three factors: Plausibility, target audience, genre fidelity.<br /><br />Star Wars was far-fetched. When you start out with Wookies, the Force, etc., you pretty much suspend rational rules and adopt an anything goes mentality. You know you're watching fantasy. However, Ender's Game doesn't position itself that way. The storyline, which you can read from the jacket, is that Earth is in the battle of its life against aliens. Desperate to survive, Earth has created a highly specialized training program to groom new military talent.  This program searches for young children with a profile of aggression, high intellect and adaptability. Once identified, these kids are taken from their families and then loaded onto a floating battle lab where they're trained to fight aliens.<br /><br />Now the idea that six year old kids, like Ender, would spend four years training and then get shipped to the front lines is a bit of a stretch. And when you factor in that Ender is not only supposed to fight when he arrives, that he's actually supposed to command an army, credulity reaches a snapping point. Would Earth really appoint a ten-year old to spearhead an invasion? Worse still, Ender Wiggins military training is essentially nothing more than laser tag in a zero-gravity chamber. And this training goes on and on, dominating nearly two thirds of the book. I, and other readers, just couldn't see how this was turning young Ender into the next George S. Patton.<br /><br />And then there is the issue of the target audience for the book, which appears to be squarely aimed at 10-15 year olds. Many will stridently deny this but the juvenile banter between characters clearly seeks to emulate the thoughts and emotions of children. There is a lot of silly name calling, talk about pubic hairs, etc. And while this may be fine for a young preteen audience, many adult readers will be turned off.<br /><br />Finally there is the issue of the genre, which seems muddled. Science fiction is more of a backdrop to Ender's Game than a foundation. It's true, they do fight aliens at the end, but that's a very minor part of the book. And, yes, they are on a spaceship. But the same scenes could have been played out practically anywhere. All you need is a zero gravity chamber, some dorm rooms and a cafeteria. The ship feels like a prop so that Card can tell a coming of age story (with a subtext on the innate violent nature of humankind tossed in). All of that is well and good but some will be confused how Ender's Game won science fiction awards when it barely seems to fit that genre.<br /><br />Please note that I'm not discounting all those readers who liked this book. I'm just trying to articulate where some of the negative feedback is coming from.
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|I'm a big fan of the book, but I HATE this movie version.    I hate every second of this movie. It is NOT Pride and Prejudice. It just simply borrows the title and characters' names from the story, that's all.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is a ridiculous movie in every respect.<br /><br />Incredibly dodgy science walks hand in hand with miraculous coincidence and appallingly bad story lines. With that in mind, why the 5 stars? Because, with a whole heap of Schadenfreude, this is one of the great comedies of our time.<br /><br />Oh yes, I really mean it!<br /><br />2012 is not in the 'So bad it's awful' category of films like the Keanu Reeves remake of [[ASIN:B001SGEUYW The Day the Earth Stood Still]]. Nor is it 'So bad it's good' that you have to see it like [[ASIN:6305760403 Plan 9 From Outer Space]] or [[ASIN:B00003CXIV Battlefield Earth]]. 2012 is genuinely funny!<br /><br />From Woody Harrelson commentating on the greatest volcanic eruption ever \\"I wish you guys could see what I'm seeing\\" and what we are seeing is his chunky builders butt; to John Cusack's deadpan \\"We're going to need a bigger plane\\" when he finds out he has to fly to China; to the wildly spinning clock that jumps from seconds to minutes, counting down to the moment the tidal wave hits; to a riotous, Oscar worthy, performance by Zlatko Buric who steals every scene as the jowly Russian oligarch Yuri Karpov: \\"Engine, shtooooooaart!\\" To truly brilliant, yet absurdly hilarious (here is where the Schadenfreude comes in), special effects: flying trains, USS JFK destroying the White House, Hawaii in flames.<br /><br />How can you not laugh when every convention of the disaster movie is rolled out before you in such crystal clarity? When every obvious plot developement is followed to the letter? The plane that out runs Yellowstone's eruption. The ex-husband pitted against the interloping new boyfriend for his families affections. The car that is faster than Tectonic quakes. The lowly scientist forced front and centre by his theories. The huge boats that survive the compete shift of earths crust regardless of the unprecedented 'getting out of the bath' kind of tidal waves it would create.<br /><br />Roland Emmerich has to have made 2012 with tongue firmly in cheek!<br /><br />The story is clich&eacute;d. A great majority of the science is bunk. The effects are great but utterly unrelated to how the events would actually happen. The heroics are impossible. Even the politics are risible. And don't get me started on the emotional subplots in the script!<br /><br />But 2012 is genuine, genuine fun. With a capital LOL! It's a LOLaster movie!

0743437497|1.0|I don't usually rate between 2-4 I either recommend or I don't. I have to say that I don't recommend this one. The journey is just not worth it in the end. King's character details are amazing at first but by page 300 you start to get really tired of it. The only thing scarier than room 217 is Chapter 38 absolute snooze fest for quite a few pages only to give you two bits of information that could have been delivered in two paragraphs and been just as interesting. To be fair I have to say that the highs in this book are awesome. If you like intense and thrilling scenes this book delivers its just that they are few and far between. King says his second draft is 1st draft minus 10%, I recommend -25%. The book is just too long for what it gives you in return. What really surprises me is that for the first 300 pages I was stoked on this book and telling people to read it, but now I'm getting to the end and I can't wait to be done with it. Perhaps King struggled with his ending and I'm feeling it, but I don't think so the book should just end way earlier than it does. This is only my fourth King book and I will certainly read more but I hope they can be as good as the first half of this one all the way through.

B0029LHW68|2.0|Review from Melt Magazine - Columbus, OH<br /><br />Fresh out of battle after being sued for breach-of-contract by Virgin Records in 2008, brothers Shannon and Jared Leto along with the other two members of 30 Seconds To Mars have returned to the forefront of mainstream, alt-rock.  This Is War, a dramatic and grandiose, self-proclaimed concept album is the band's third release of the five they were contracted to record within the last decade through Virgin, hence the lawsuit. Sonically, we find the band lost in space, often discharging the heavy guitar stacks and swapping synths and samples under Leto's heroic shrills.  An experimental epic, This Is War employs some unconventional tactics such as a reoccurring choir of fans, one thousand voices strong, that was recorded at a band-hosted gathering in LA during the record's conception.  The UK's finest: Mark Ellis and Steve Lillywhite boarded the project to produce the sound from the same angle as some of alternative rock's cream of the crop.  Depeche Mode, U2, Nine Inch Nails, Talking Heads, Morrissey... just a few pages from their collaborative portfolios. As a result, the tracks are drenched in a metallic ambiance that brings to mind an eerie, abandon space-station like setting as equal parts organic and electronic sounds bounce off dim control panels and down the hall.  Songwriting and arrangement are more ambitious and \\"maturish\\" than ever, another result of working with the nasty British duo. Not to mention the fact that the recording process took place during the most turbulent two years of the band's career.<br /><br />The underlining \\"call to arms\\" theme and over-dramatic sentiment couple in astronomical choruses, wherein Leto's respiratory system is pushed slightly beyond the breaking point and the chill factor is achieved.  Still, for an album that has been rallied around the word \\"conceptual\\" the message remains vague, somewhere between My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade and Muse's latest eviction notice to the secretive, social elite.  Some kind of deep, metaphoric expression of rising against... just, everything that sucks in general... or something like that. Standout tracks Night Of The Hunter, Search And Destroy and Stranger In A Strange Land hit the mark as all growsed-up emo, while some of the others are still learning how not to make the mascara run. Be forewarned. Due to long periods of downtime between climaxes, the listen can get pretty tedious at times.  It's going to take a one on one, thorough approach to walk away from This Is War with more than you came with. But, beyond the annoyingly catchy and optimistic radio single \\"Kings And Queens\\", there is some substance here for the dedicated. -Tyler Starkeyetive, social elite.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|Review from Melt Magazine - Columbus, OH<br /><br />There's not a young vixen alive today that can strut a minor scale with the chic anguish of the now 51 year old, British goddess of love and loss: Sade Adu.  As the frontwoman and lead vocalist of the Grammy Award winning group with which she shares her name, Sade supplied the pop charts with consistently somber and sexy hit songs like \\"Smooth Operator\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\" throughout the 80's and 90's before starting a ten year hiatus in 2000.  Two weeks out of the gate, 'Soldier of Love' the newest Sade release has taken it's place at number one on the U.S. Billboard Chart and more than ten other charts worldwide, justifying the unprecedented anticipation hovering around the project since it was announced last year.  One of my worst fears was that the new material from the artist that was probably playing when I was conceived would be polluted with at least some of the musical malformations the past ten years have birthed. I mean, autotune and guest appearances from Lil Wayne on a Sade song may be a stretch, but as Chris Cornell and Timbaland demonstrated in 2009, the studio can be a dangerous place for the human soul, depending on who is operating the mouse and keyboard.  On 'Soldier Of Love' we find Sade's voice a little older, a little wiser and thankfully as dysthymic as ever.<br /><br />Track one, 'The Moon And The Sky' definitely gets things moving in the right direction form the start.  A mournful, classical guitar accompanies a downtempo hip hop-ish beat before the early-nineties synth lead sexes up the whole thing a bit.  Then, the reason you purchased the cd: that hypnotic, aching alto joins the scene, possibly the duskiest human voice captured to hard drive in a decade.  This one goes right up next to 'King of Sorrow' on the 'between anti-depressant prescriptions playlist\\".  Next up, the title track takes the cake for the most evolved sounding song on the record.  The stop-and-go, drum-line rhythm is incredibly different from anything currently on the radio, but the real payoff comes two minutes in, when the song finally climaxes for the first time by way of stacked, ascending harmonies.  The rest of the record is not at all a far cry from the group's past body of work, mostly infectious chill out tracks to mope around to without feeling bad about it.  If you're like me, you will skip the two or three upbeat cuts.  \\"Come on Sade, I'm seriously sad here, why did you have to go and drop an optimistic, baby-daddy story (track four) on me?\\"  I guess all the jaded lovers listening, need that hopeful splash in the face from time to time to keep them from putting down the garage door and testing their hybrid's fuel efficiency in neutral. - Tyler Starkeyferent from anything currently on the radio, but the real payoff comes two minutes in, when the song finally climaxes for the first time by way of stacked, ascending harmonies.

0765316897|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this series. I was a bit ambivalent about the sudden introduction of oppositional gods introduced at the end of book two, but I was willing to see where the author would go, down that path.<br /><br />I won't say that book three was a bad book, but it was disappointing compared to the first two. There were far too many just-in-time escapes enabled by unlikely plot devices. The constant shifting of character POVs from one chapter to the next didn't work -- I found it distracting and it made it hard to really get engaged with any of the characters, even Vin and Elend, the main protagonists. The only secondary viewpoints I cared about were TenSoon's, because it was interesting to see what Kandra culture was like. Spook's story, on the other hand, bored me, and I got sick of Sazed's whining very quickly. How many pages did Sanderson have to devote to Sazed's angst about faith?<br /><br />Getting back to Vin and Elend: their relationship really was a bit lacking all through the series. The only time I found their emotions believable and compelling was in book one, really, when Vin actually acted like a sixteen-year-old girl in love. By book three, she's a hardened killing machine (at the age of twenty) and he's gone from bookish, nerdy scholar to heroic warrior-king, and one gets the sense that Sanderson is embarrassed to write any kind of adult romance. I'm not asking for explicit sex scenes, but Vin and Elend seem to idealize one another in an almost platonic fashion. They talk about how much they love and respect and trust one another, but there's almost nothing about physical attraction or companionship or any kind of softer feelings.<br /><br />The ending was a literal deux ex machina, and while there was enough set-up to make it (almost) believable, it still had the feel of \\"And then suddenly God made everything all better.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, I got really annoyed that after making the Lord Ruler a horrible villain in the first two books, suddenly he's almost a hero here. I guess the horrific, brutal, thousand-year oppression of the Skaa was all Ruin's fault? If the Lord Ruler gets credit for all of his preparations to try to save the world from Ruin, I don't think he gets to escape blame for all of the evil things he did by saying it was \\"because of Ruin's influence.\\"<br /><br />So, while I would recommend the entire series, and even the final book, I do feel that Sanderson's execution didn't quite come through in the conclusion to this epic.st a hero here.

The Osaka Sun Remix of \\"Lovers in Japan\\" doesn't sound noticeably different than the original, except for the end of the song. \\"Lost+\\" is basically \\"Lost!\\" with Jay-Z rapping over the bridge. (It's my least favorite song on the EP).  \\"Life in Technicolor ii\\" is a longer version of \\"Life in Technicolor\\" (the opening track on Viva La Vida) with lyrics.    If you enjoyed Viva La Vida, you'll enjoy this!
0307266303|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic for several reasons:    It IS one of those books that will inspire you, make you pause and wonder, and force you to reconsider your current life.  The content is fascinating, engaging, hilarious and really a pleasure to read.    It is full of interviews from famous ultramarathon runners, exercise physiologists, and doctors.    It makes you want to run -- faster and longer than you ever have before.        My only gripe? I didn't give a clear section on how to improve your running gait to resemble that of the Tarahumara.  There are bits and pieces in the book, but I ultimately read the book to figure out how to run into my 90s, and still never experience pain in my knees.   I suspect he probably will be covering (or capitalizing?) on this in future seminars or another book.    Well worth your time.  If you read 1 book this year, this should be it.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I loved it from the first sound.  Unlike CD's you have to put in the car and spend a month with   to let the tracks grow on you, this CD hooked me in total.    She's not new, but it took me awhile getting around to buying a CD  of hers and listening to several of her songs at one sitting.    Similar to Norah Jones' distintive sound and stylings, this artist  is so listenable for me. I can't imagine hearing a sample track and   ever being disappointed with the rest of the package. There is  enough range and pace across her music to keep it from being   monotonous.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|I'm so glad I listened to samples on here. This is one of the worse things I've heard. It's just plain bad and all I've listened to were samples of a few tracks. They do not make me want to listen anymore, let alone buy it. I was curious on whether this album was any good, it's not. It's really a sad attempt of a rapper trying his hand at rock, unfortunately. It would be like if Metallica cut a rap album. Some people can do it, Lil Wayne isn't one of them. Leave this to the professionals, rappers like Cypress Hill who can cross over with ease. I tried but I can't stomach it. It feels so recycled.
1400052173|5.0|There are many great reviews on this book (unfortunately, I had higher priority school materials to read first), so I'll just provide my general impressions here.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an extraordinary book written by a journalist whose commitment to the story goes beyond that typically seen in today's books. Skloot spends years with the Lacks family, particularly Henrietta's daughter Deborah, in order to provide a side of the HeLa cells story from a completely different (and quite sympathetic) point of view. She also digs deep into the racist medical practices of Johns Hopkins hospital in the '50s.<br /><br />There is so much meat to this journey -- the very scary history of genetic research in the past 50 years, the story of Henrietta herself, the changing emotions of her children and husband, and the impact of her cancer cells in health science even today. I don't normally use the cliche of \\"a book I can't put down,\\" but in this case it is absolutely true. I was riveted by all the details and pretty well frightened when Skloot said that there still aren't enough laws to protect my tissues from being used without my knowledge.<br /><br />This book reads very cinematically. Skloot provides vivid images of the characters, their surroundings, and the road trips she takes with Deborah. If a producer does make The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks into a film, I truly hope that he/she gives the profits to the Lacks children and grandchildren. It's shameful that they cannot get health care when their ancestor's cells have brought so much profit to the health sector. On the bright side, author Skloot promised to give money from the book sales to the grandchildren.<br /><br />I would recommend this for people interested in health science, African American history and the politics of race, as well as very good journalism.

1906694176|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the last of the series. Because of the author's death, we will not see any more books, and it is impossible to read this novel and not feel that there was more left to say about these characters, and this spectacular heroine. However, I will say that he wraps up all the major plot threads. I was less than compelled by a couple of the subplots in this book, and I became a little weary of how sexually irresistible the male protagonist supposedly is. However, the courtroom climax is tremendous. While my least favorite of the three, I read this conclusion as compulsively as I read the other two. Truly, a compelling series. And, atypically for most thrillers of this type, quite feminist!

B000VBJEEG|4.0|Remy the Rat, unlike his brother, father, and extended family, refuses to eat just anything that he finds lying around.  He is a gourmand - sneaking into a human's kitchen to read her cookbooks, trying various mushrooms to try and find the best match to his cheese, etc.  When he ends up in Paris, he finds Gusteau's restaurant in a declining state - savaged by the critic Ego, with a head chef more interested in developing microwave burritoes than in cooking fine food.    The biggest hurdle to enjoying this film, as mentioned in the Amazon description, is the fact that this movie is about rats.  Hundreds of them in some scenes.  Ironically, it's the success of the advances in computer animation that makes it difficult - these are not the rodents of \\"The Rescuers\\".  They are much more realistic and even I, who have no particular aversion to rats, was a little creeped out by the hyper-realism of Remy's rippling fur.    Ultimately the story comes down to the conflict between Remy (and his human avatar Linguini) and the critic Ego.  The resolution of this conflict is so surprisingly satisfying and effective that it redeems the entire film, which is otherwise not particularly original.      I can also report that this film works well for children.  Although too dialogue-heavy for really young children, my son inserted the film into his regular rotation starting about age 4.  It's not requested as much as Cars (obviously!) but it's certainly watched more often than Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., or Aladdin.    This DVD has a couple of really good extras - the short \\"Lifted\\" (which, again, my 4-year-old loves) and the promo short \\"Your Friend the Rat\\".  But these two short films - grand total of maybe 15 minutes - is the sum total of all the extras.  There are no making-of featurettes, no director's commentary, etc.  For children, I'm sure they don't care.  For animation/Disney afficionados, this is disappointing to say the least, especially considering that Pixar commentaries are usually very entertaining and informative.
B001HN694K|5.0|In this new Tim Burton version of the Alice in Wonderland story, we follow a grown-up Alice down the proverbial Rabbit Hole and into the world of Wonderland (called Underland in this version).  Alice believes that this place is one that she has created in her dreams.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are there to greet her, beginning with the White Rabbit, whom she pursues until she falls down the Rabbit Hole.  As she encounters the growing and shrinking phenomenon, she gathers her wits about her and sets off to explore.<br /><br />But just prior to these events, we'd seen Alice at a garden party, during which a rather unattractive young man had proposed marriage to her in a gazebo--and in front of all the guests--putting her on the spot.<br /><br />Like the version with the younger Alice, we see this young woman \\"escaping\\" from a situation that has made her uncomfortable by falling into a world inhabited by fantasies and quirky characters.<br /><br />But unlike the earlier versions, this Alice adventure is no harmless escapade, but has many rather frightening creatures who confront her at every turn.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska stars as Alice, Anne Hathaway is the White Queen, Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen, and Johnny Depp is charming as the Mad Hatter.  If I had to choose a favorite performance, it would be a toss-up between Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  Mia did a nice job as well.<br /><br />The plot line is fairy predictable and, except for some variations, follows the original fairly closely.  What sets this movie apart is the fabulous imagery and special effects that seem larger than life and beyond surreal.<br /><br />I found it an enjoyable movie that didn't seem to drag, despite its two-hour length.<br /><br />To me, it deserved five stars.
1591843162|4.0|Seth Godin is a linchpin. He creates useful and enlightening written content. He covers business, marketing, personal growth, and career success with a single brush stroke. He's a marketing guru, a public persona, a sage.    He also defies simple explanation.    That very characteristic-using a combination of attributes to become indispensable at what you do-is a key feature of linchpins. A linchpin is a person with a unique skill set and way of doing things. Their combination of skills, talents, and abilities, which Godin defines in his book, make them indispensable.    If a linchpin works in a company, they are the person a company can't live without. Well-known corporate linchpins include Steve Jobs or Google's Marissa Mayer.    Linchpins that don't work for companies are indispensable, too. They provide something so economically valuable that they're changing their industry. Jay Parkinson is an example. Many affect large numbers of people in a positive way. Like your favorite barista at the coffee shop-the one you look forward to seeing every time you visit. Whether corporate or not, because of their unique abilities, no linchpins want for contacts or jobs.    In his new book, \\"Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?,\\" Seth Godin makes the case that the world needs more linchpins. He gives you background on why linchpins are so valuable right now. He makes it clear how linchpins operate, who they are, and why you need to be one.    Companies Need Linchpins    Mediocrity, just showing up to work and doing what you're told, used to guarantee you a paycheck. It won't anymore, writes Godin. Today, our economy rewards the people without whom the company can't function. You guessed it-linchpins.    Some businesses have a model of hiring \\"cheap drones (they) can scale, replace, and disrespect.\\" But that, claims Godin, won't lead to customer loyalty or growth. It's not a good strategy; it's survival and maintenance. In order to flourish, a company needs linchpins. What's goodfor the individual (being indispensable) is good for the company, too.    Content    In his book, Godin doesn't tell you how to be a linchpin. Instead, he gives you an aggregate picture of who linchpins are, what they do, and why they're so coveted.    Godin starts the book by setting the stage for today's work world. Many previously white-collar projects can now be done for free, either by crowds or by machines. Obedience and just showing up to work are passé. Unfortunately, school and the media have indoctrinated people to be factory workers. As a result, we automatically buy into a career system constructed on fear: Obey the boss or be fired.    Godin emphasizes that we need to cast that aside. He details what you need to do in order to change your factory-worker mentality. Instead of just sitting down and blankly following orders, you have to bring your soul to work. You have to stay human and be brave. You need to create, connect, and invent in your work. And, of course, you have to work hard.    If being remarkable feels threatening, Godin explains why in following chapters. The amygdala, or lizard brain, will try to sabotage your best efforts, he says. If the lizard brain perceives something as being too risky, it tries to stop. It does this by making you hesitate, compelling you to overdo things, and undermining your confidence. After showing you how the lizard brain tries to stop you, Godin tells you how to thwart it.    Subsequent chapters define the qualities and abilities of a linchpin. Linchpins are artists, per a definition that Godin puts forth in the next chapter. They bring emotional labor to their work. They are generous, giving without expectation of reciprocity. This is an essential quality in an economy that has integrated a culture of gifts, according to the author.    Linchpins also don't wait for instructions. They figure out how to create value, then go do it. If you want to be a linchpin, make your own map. If this scares you, make the choice to be bigger than your lizard brain.    Now you've decided to be a generous, self-motivated, fear-accepting artist. There's more. In order to be a linchpin, you must be socially intelligent. You connect with other people through genuine human interactions. This connection helps make you indispensable.    The linchpin picture is almost complete. Towards the end of the book, Godin adds a few more details to round it off. Besides bringing emotional labor to work and making their own maps, linchpins interact with customers, staff, and members of their organization. They possess a unique kind of creativity and talent. They use their internal map-making skills and judgment to manage complexity. Good judgment and generosity, combined with deep knowledge of your field, is yet another ability.    He concludes the book with a qualifier. Putting your heart and soul into your art doesn't always monetize. If this is the case, continue to be a generous artist. Learn from your previous experience. The compromise, if you can call it that, is to learn \\"how to love what you do to make money.\\"    Remarks    Linchpin read like a series of blog posts. The writing style leaves latitude for personal interpretation. Depending on your experience and situation, Linchpin's messages will hit you on a personal level, more so than other business books. Here's what I took away.    As an entrepreneur, I didn't find the first six chapters groundbreaking. I already have my suspicions about the effectiveness of the factory model, schooling, and \\"just showing up\\" to work. It was pleasant to affirm my beliefs by reading what Godin had to say, but that's all.    I loved the second half of the book, however. My favorite chapter was called \\"The Resistance.\\" It focuses on thwarting the overprotective tendencies of the amygdala, or lizard brain. The chapter explains how fear manifests and how to effectively accept it while staying in charge. Personally-and the book is personal-I found this to be the most useful chapter.    Following chapters let me piece together a picture of what a linchpin looks like. I didn't find a roadmap on how to be one (I guess I'm supposed to make my own map), but I found enough descriptions for a clearer mental image of a linchpin.    Some je ne sais quoi in Godin's writing also inspired me to try to be a linchpin. The mental picture of a linchpin, combined with the inspiration to try to fit that image, settled over me subtly, like a blanket. Something permeated. I do not know how it will manifest.    By the end of the book, I had absorbed the following message: Society rewards you for standing out, giving gifts, making connections, and being remarkable. I was motivated to try.    I'll keep this book around because I want to sustain that inspiration, not just go back to old routines and let the book's message fizzle out. Some might find this book mind-blowing--it depends on how you think and your personal situation. I recommend it for everybody. I would especially encourage you to read it if you're in a disappointing job, discouraged about work, or feel stuck in your business or career. Linchpin has a magic about it. Don't miss it.     (Book review by Drea Knufken)
B000XR49VQ|1.0|Peter Greenaway's films have been poorly served up by the DVD industry. This one, released theatrically in 1991, stars John Gielgud and was scored by by Michael Nyman. I'm not commenting on the film itself. (But it is a masterpiece, IMHO.)    Here I'm commenting on the DVD edition of \\"Prospero's Books\\" released by \\"AAE Films, Inc.\\" on 18 September 2009 and  currently retailing on Amazon for about US$72. It has no UPC#, which suggests it's not a standard US DVD release.    Between 2007 and 2009 I bought, from Amazon and other DVD retailers, four DVDs released by \\"Allied Artists Entertainment.\\" I threw all four of them away after one viewing (really after watching the first 10 minutes). I'll never again purchase a DVD released by Allied Artists Entertainment,\\" \\"Allied Artists Classics,\\" or \\"Allied Artists,\\" even if it's a true classic unobtainable from any other source.    As others have noted, this film really deserves Criterion treatment,but that's unlikely. Instead studios around the world continue to release onto the DVD market endless excrement, or as in this case, *offensively bad* and *outrageously overpriced* editions of great films. Amazon has recently begun marketing some classic films (e.g \\"Dreamchild\\") on demand, using DVD-R recordable media, for reasonable prices. The results are not outstanding, but better than nothing. Amazon should do the same for \\"Prospero's Books.\\"
B00004W5A6|5.0|At this point, if you are thinking of buying the SACD, you are debating shelling out quite a bit of cash.   Is it worth it?    I am going to say yes. I dropped over 50.00 on this, and I expected to be overwhelmed. I won't say it is as great as I had hoped, but I am still not complaining.     One of the things that strike me about SACD's is that the instruments are very separated and distinct. That is certainly the case here. I don't think I had ever noticed the bass and drums before!    And the guitar player is not bad either. :)    Considering how often you are going to pull this disc out, plus the upgrade in sound, I would suggest picking one up.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Everything is okay until Will goes in search of those who killed Beckham. That is not military, that is not suspense. Then the confusing night scene which culminates in the wounding of Eldridge by Will hurts the momentum of the movie.    The helpless innocent man with the bombs padlocked to his body is pathetic, as is the sight of Will in the cereal aisle of the grocery store, but the power of the movie ended with the sniper scene in the desert with Ralph Fiennes. If Bigelow had removed those later scenes and replaced them with something better, more to the point, the whole movie would have been excellent.    The absurdity of war, the civilian population looking on either indifferently or with concealed lethal intentions, is well done. In one scene there is an Iraqi with a camcorder hoping to get footage of the Americans being blown up.     The character of Will is haunting, the war addict, who is unfit for civilian life and can only go from war to war, defusing bombs until something or someone kills him.    The reappearance of Beckham, who was not after all the dead boy with the body bomb, is a fine irony. To Will, just as much as anyone else, the Iraqis \\"all look alike.\\" Will turns and walks away in disgust at his own error.    Unstated, but palpable everywhere, is the obvious fact that we shouldn't be there, we should be home in our own country. By invading a foreign country we become the victims of its own captive people. They pick us off one by one, and our unfortunate soldiers say, \\"They won't come out and fight.\\" It is Eldridge who says cynically, \\"Iraq is death.\\" If a foreign nation invaded America, we would certainly sow our roads and highways with IEDs, and we would use ambushes and snipers to make the foreign power as uncomfortable as possible. Our founding Fathers did this during the Revolutionary War.    The occupation goes on, as Ho Chi Minh said, \\"Until the Americans leave.\\" Like the Romans, like the Mongols, the Americans will tire of being here andwill go someplace else to build their empire.

B001609SQA|5.0|Although it lacks the atmospheric dark ambience of the original (\\"Alien\\"), it more than makes up for it by way of suspense and action. This is probably the best one of the series.
0790729393|5.0|THis movie is really good. It's kind of sad, and disturbing. It seems like something Scorcese would've produced, it was really good.
B002Z8LPZ4|3.0|Not much here to see except Kate Beckinsale.<br />I just won't pan a movie if she's in it, or it would get 1 star.
6305428042|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, and to this day it's one of my favorite movies. It's got a good story, it's funny, the setting is beautiful, it's action packed but still family friendly. It's just a good movie.
B002S4KMM2|3.0|Season 6 is by far the weakest of all 7 seasons of this series.  Rose mcGowan was not the greatest choice for Teddy, Annie's psychic trauma should have been more fully explored, Liz was too easy on Christian, and Wilber barely showed up at all.      It's still worth watching for the overall strengths of the main cast members, the music, and some storylines, but that's about it.

031606792X|2.0|While I'm not done with Breaking Dawn, it is, so far, the weirdest book I think I've ever read.  I'm not going to give anything away, but WOW.  I agree with whoever said it's like it was written by a different author.  The first book, while extremely slow and plodding in the beginning, had a great finish to it, and books 2 and 3 were fast paced and great reads.  This one, frankly, stinks.  I'll finish this book just because I have so much time invested in the series that I can't NOT finish it, but what a disappointment.

B001UV4XX8|1.0|What a disapointment, what a crappy movie. I looked forward to this because Cameron Diaz was in it. Started out good and then went downhill from there. Interesting premise that did not pan out.  To the other reviewer whom said \\"save your time and money\\", I wish I had read your review before I purchased. To all others, heed our warning.
0446567337|4.0|I decided to read this book after seeing previews for the movie (although I have not seen the movie yet).  I was looking for an easy read that I hoped would not be too much of a cheesy love story, and this ended up being just what I wanted.  Its not just a love story about a boy and a girl, but its also about a relationship between father and son (the later being what actually touched me more emotionally.)  About halfway through, most things started to become predictable for me though.  It does have a bit of an awkward ending, which left me wanting a little bit more, but at the same time I was glad that the author didn't sell out and conveniently kill off anyone just to give the readers the ending we'd want.  Of course, it includes familiarities of North Carolina, which I love.  All in all, an easy-to-read love story and I enjoyed it... just glad I spent less than $5 on it.  (I purchased the Kindle edition for my I-Touch.  Kindle is awesome!)
B000002O51|5.0|Third Stage is Boston's best album, because it's the most diversified. Yes, Tom's guitar is still so very recognizable and definitive of their sound (as usual), but this album features a little bit of everything, from soft rock ballads (Amanda) to harder and more energetic tunes, such as Cool the Engines. I particularly like Hollyann, I Think I Like It, We're Ready, and Can'tcha Say. This album is musically superior, but technically inferior. The 8 years that it took to complete this album is legendary. One can tell that technical problems were aplenty, as certain songs lack fullness in bass and it almost sounds like it's coming through a transistor radio. However, if one can ignore these problems, they can enjoy a fine album worthy of praise. It's too bad that the album was already outdated by the time it was released, because most of the songs were written and performed in 1981. As for me, I don't care if something is outdated--as long as it's good. How I rank the Boston albums through 1994: Third Stage, Walk On, Boston, Don't Look Back.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Watching this in the movies was great, but at home it's even better. You'll want to sing every lyric, get up and dance and enjoy the extra footage.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It's appalling how far reaching Corporate practices and corruption control our daily lives, mostly unknowingly.  I think this should be viewed on a National scale so a revolution is my faster, but I realize the powers that be would do much to prevent such a radical viewing stage when it exposes how backwards so many of our overseen systems are operating under these days.      We've been moved to eat grass fed beef and organic chicken and eggs, and looking into a local co-op.  I already have been making many things at home to avoid all of those corn based ingredients (it's hard enough to avoid HFCS and sugar!), this just puts us on a faster track to being even more decisive in what products we buy.  It's bad enough to think about all of the prescription pills in our water supply that's not removed, we don't need to contribute more chemicals and pesticides to that as well.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|Is Donnie Darko a good movie? Yes. Is this movie a good movie? No. I wish I could give this movie a negative rating. There will be spoilers found here, but think of them more as saving your life from watching such awful garbage.  I've seen MANY movies, thousands of movies. I like a lot of relatively bad movies. But this movie is not one of those movies. This movie seems to be an example of how marijuana makes stupid ideas seem good.  I can imagine two stoners laying out the plot for this heavy-handed, useless mess of movie.  ------------------------------------------  \\"dude.......what if, what IF, an alien being came here to , like, judge us, man. and there was like, nothing we could do. We didn't even know they were testing us.\\"  \\"yeah, and the aliens had all this cool technology that, like, we humans just couldn't understand. Like there was no way to understand it.\\"  \\"yeah.\\"  \\"yeah. totally.\\"  \\"because the world is screwed up man, totally screwed up.  people just want money and stuff.\\"  \\"yeah like what if the aliens offered them money and then if they picked the money then that's it. they are screwed.\\"  \\"And what would be cool is if this guy got hit by lightning and then came back to life and like he was the alien.\\"  ---------------------------------------  what?!?!?!?!?!?!??!  First of all, what a bunch of BS.  Nothing but stupid hippy crap about how people are materialistic and shallow. none of the plot ideas make any sense together, and on top of it all, is the ridiculous idea of aliens coming to wipe out the evil humans.  so stupid.  Lightning? how is that even relevant?  Mainly just because they wanted to have the special effect of half his face melted off. Yet there is a line in the movie that the aliens are \\"the people who control the lightning.\\" Just one of several stupid subplots that never goes anywhere above just being thrown in there because it sounds weird.  Aliens?  why aliens you ask? why not just some guy with a gun, doing the same thing. oh wait.that movie is called SAW IV.  I forgot.  Also, in what stupid hippy world do aliens come and judge us?  don't they have there own problems?  if they are so perfect and advanced, they would obviously realize that the actions of a few don't describe the whole population.  Also, the \\"tests\\" they use are fifth-grade level mentality without any connection to real-world complexity. Life just isn't that simple. People may say they will do one thing, and then when it really comes down to it in a REAL LIFE situation (which does not include pressing magic buttons) people can do all sorts of humanistic, altruistic, heroic actions such as diving in rivers to save drowning children, sacrificing themselves to give their children a better life, etc.  If you are an alien, you may be surprised to learn that tricking people into such a simple-minded decision as pressing a magic button is not the best way to test a person's good nature. How about this: the sum of all the things they have ever done in their life?!?!?!?  stupid button pressing.  Secondly, what?!? WTF even happened in this movie near the end?  ooooooh, it's so hard to make magical decisions that destroy your life. what a conundrum.  what the hell happened with the water doorways? oh, that doesn't matter. it's to horrible to tell. quote from movie: \\"it's a place.....a place neither here nor there.\\"  WOW. W.O.W. is that ever dumb.  No need to develop that idea.  It's just magic, alien technology that clearly leads into life-changing tragedies as well as poor film making decisions.  Also, to be honest with you, there are way too many people on earth. WAY too many. no one wants to talk about the fact that altruism/materilistic selfish behavior may just be an evolutionary population control so that some people do selfish things that exploit others, cause death in the long run but that this MIGHT ACTUALLY be a good thing. That's right, I said it. We might need both good and bad people until we can sort out the whole limited space and resources issue of living on earth. If energy/food was free, there would be a lot more nice people, i'm sure.  what is the message of the movie? be a good person...and the aliens won't F**** with you.  well, thank you, movie, for giving such helpful advice.  I'm going back to watch \\"human target\\" on Fox now, something that actually makes sense.....
B000HEWEEY|4.0|Everything ok except metal box items came in was dented a little. Based on packaging I would have to say it was that way when it went into the shipping container.Unfortunate
B000EHQ8AU|5.0|I'm fairly new to Placebo and have been exploring their discography, Meds is so far one of the strongest albums I've come across. Melodically sophisticated, stimulating lyrics and addicting. The two disc set was a great deal for the price and I look forward to adding more of their CDs to my collection.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|What a great movie to watch, the effects are what made it happen. The plot is simple enough, its the end of our planet as we know it. As for the main characters barely escaping every possible phase of this tragedy, it is horribly ridiculous. But if you want action this is a mamoth of action flicks, highly entertaining!
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|So sad that this is a-ha's last album.  It's as wonderful as the rest of their library.  There will be a huge hole in the music industry if they stop making music.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|No one can deny that this movie carried a significant amount of hype prior to its release. Why wouldn't it? It was James Cameron's first big movie since Titanic. This movie was the brain-child of Cameron since the 80's and now he felt he could do the movie justice with the recent innovations in technology. James Cameron succeeded in creating the most beautiful movie ever conceived, yet there is one area where he drastically failed at, the story.      Avatar is the story of a Marine's adventure in human diplomacy with an alien species called the \\"Na'vi\\" on a far away planet called \\"Pandora.\\" The way the humans conduct diplomacy is through human-Na'vi hybrids. The humans are on Pandora because there is a native substance called \\"Unubtanium\\" that is worth a considerable amount of money. I will not go to much further into the story so I do not spoil anything.      The best part of this film is the visuals. The visuals are spectacular. I promise you, there is no other movie as visually jaw-dropping as Avatar. I personally watched this film in I-MAX 3D theater and was completely blown away. Every piece of this film looks extremely detailed and colorful. \\"Avatar\\" has set a new new bar for cinematic visuals and it will take a bit of work for anyone else to match it, let alone top it. The next best part about Avatar is the acting. There are some very solid performances and they fit their rolls nicely.      Even with breath-taking visuals and solid performances, Avatar is met with some considerable negatives. First off, the story. If you have viewed any of the trailers for Avatar, then you basically know the story. The film is nearly 3 hours long, and many parts seem to drag on. Some parts of the movie were seemed to be elongated so we could marvel at the movie's visual brilliance, but even that fails. You see, by about an hour and a half into the movie, you start to get used to the 3D visuals and they quit looking as appealing to you. This is about the part of the movie where Cameron apparently felt that we should bring the story to a near-complete halt in order to gander at some colorful trees and such. What made Avatar a great movie also made Avatar a rather bland movie, and that is the use of vibrant visuals over a compelling story. The movie never makes any attempt to set itself apart, other than with visuals. Sure, visuals are nice, but is that all Cameron wants from his 25 year old brain-child is for it to be known as looking pretty? When maybe 10 to 15 years later the visuals used in Avatar will be considered obsolete? Avatar seems like a starch contrast to Titanic, which did have an excellent story and great visuals for its time. But looking back, do we remember Titanic for its great visuals? No, we think back to its very engaging story-line because its visuals are very obsolete. Avatar will for now be thought of as being the most visually gorgeous film thus far, but how long will it be able to keep that title?       The second problem with Avatar is emotional detachment. How is a viewer suppose to feel any kind of emotion toward a side that they are bullied into following? Avatar pulls every trick in the book to make us want to turn away from the corporation/military/human-side and join the Na'vi. The problem with this is that there seems to be no transition between following the humans and then to the Na'vi. The human-side is full of stereo-typical corporate figureheads and military people who are more interested in genocide than negotiation. This makes it hard to want to side with them but the movie insists for us to, at first. Later, the movie forces us to follow the peace-loving Na'vi people and hate the humans. Wait, so now the movie wants me to hate the humans that they told me to love but I hated at the beginning and now love the people that at the beginning I was suppose to hate because the humans told me to? By not allowing the viewer to make up their own mind voids the emotional bond one can make with the film. Ifthere is no type of emotional bond, then we are just staring at a bunch of moving objects for an alloted amount of time.       \\"Avatar\\" is a visually spectacular in every way, but that is its only great feature. James Cameron fitted his latest film with all the eye-candy it would ever need, but just didn't give it anything else that would stand out. With a weak story and emotionless effort made by it to bond with its viewers, Avatar can ONLY be chocked up by one phrase, \\"visually beautiful.\\" One might think that would be enough, but think hard about the best looking movie before Avatar....exactly.
B002QZKK6Q|5.0|This is a wonderful album from start to finish. Short and sweet...you will love this!
B001OQCV2E|3.0|I'll keep my own review short and not necessarily sweet, because I can't add anything that hasn't already been said. $1,000,000,000,000.00 special effects, with a $0.15 story. (did an eight year old write this, or what?)    Almost every action movie cliche' known to man and the entire universe is used in this movie. Over and over. And over again. The harrowing escapes from certain death, repeatedly, actually had me crying out at one point \\"Oh, COME ON!\\" The luck these people had....let's just say that if an average Joe suddenly had their kind of luck he or she would win the lottery every week for 5 years straight. And score a hole-in-one on the golf course 75 times in 75 days. And bowl a perfect 300 at the....well, you get the idea.    Now, to be completely fair, I gave this movie 3 stars on the strength of the special effects alone. WOW. You would be hard pressed to find a movie that tops this one in that endeavor. Absolutely mind-boggling eye candy! Alot of talent and effort DID go into that, and I can (and did) admire and appreciate it.    While I wouldn't recommend buying this (as I did) I would definitely recommend it for a rental. If you can get past the laughably bad, unblievable over-the-top heroics, you will enjoy it.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|Those folks looking for another big beat pop album like \\"So\\" might as well move along already. This release is nearly 180 degrees in the opposite direction. However, if one is willing to remain open-minded about how an album of cover tunes should sound like, then there are some unearthed treasures to be found here.     I find it interesting that Gabriel seems to consider this collection of tunes he didn't write as one of his most personal statements. Certainly most of these covers are pretty radical reinterpretations from what these tunes originally sounded like, which is a definite plus. On the other hand, the virtual similarity of orchestral and vocal arrangements on many tunes begin to bog down the proceedings in a lot of sonic \\"sameness\\", for lack of a better term. The lack of any percussive beat throughout also doesn't help with breaking up the tempo monotony. One can rightly accuse this album of simply droning on too long.     Despite those valid criticisms, one might find that this release sort of combines together all of the quieter moments from previous Gabriel releases (such as \\"Father, Son\\", \\"Here Comes the Flood\\", et al.), and adds another refrain to this particular song cycle. \\"Listening Wind\\" seems to transform into a companion piece to \\"San Jacinto\\". \\"My Body is a Cage\\" reminds me of previous material like \\"Darkness\\" and \\"No Self Control\\" in themes on personal paranoia and fears.       So overall, an interesting experiment, even if not entirely successful. Devoted Peter Gabriel enthusiasts should give it a try, and others probably should wait to hear some tracks first (which one can do by simply venturing over to Gabriel's own website for some samples), then decide.

B000W99IK2|5.0|I bought this cd only for the remarkable No. 9 from 1968, which is the best performance of this symphony that I`ve ever heard.<br /><br />S. Peterson, in his comment, hit the nail on the head by explaining this performance`s elan and exuberance. However, one important feature with Karajan`s No. 9 which really captivated me is his quick pace with the Andante, running just over a brisk 12 minutes. I rarely prefer the speeding up of movements, especially with Bruckner`s symphonies or ANY slow movements. Yet here, it works wonderfully, bringing a winsome and airy feel to it. Though I have to agree with Santa Fe Listener`s comment that the beginning trumpets starting the fourth movement are a little messy and unclear.<br /><br />Karajan`s No.8 is a very fine recording, one of the best I`ve ever come across. Yet, Santa Fe is right again remarking that it`s a little emotionally detached at times. The absolute best version of this symphony, BAR NONE, is Sinopoli`s 1983 DG Philharmonia performance. Even Karajan`s 8th can`t compare with this emotionally charged masterpiece.<br />Anyway, I still very strongly recommend this very worthwhile cd.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|It doesn't matter that this documentary isn't \\"new\\".  What matters is the event. Philippe Petit did what no person has ever done, or will ever do again.  His accomplishment is so unbelievable it borders on the spiritual.  He is an incredible man, a true spirit, impervious to the crippling code of \\"it can't be done\\". He is truly a hero in today's world of false bravado. I only wish I had  been one of the gaping crowd in the street below witnessing Petit's unparalleled feat.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Loved the movie and the deluxe edition of the soundtrack. But I was bummed to see that my favorite song from the movie \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\" is nowhere to b found in either the regular or deluxe edition. Was expecting it to b on the deluxe edition because it's the Deluxe edition. Although many songs skipped on the regular version r here the omition of that one song takes away a star(bummer).
B001HN694K|4.0|An older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland after escaping a planned engagement party, that was planned by everyone but her. While in Wonderland, the white rabbit thinks he might have lured the wrong Alice into the Rabbit's hole. But the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) believes she's the real Alice and that she's the chosen one to bring down the Red Queen (Helen Bohen Carter). The Red Queen stole the thrown from her good sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and has forced everyone to worship her.<br /><br />  I like that it's not an unnecessary remake, we have had the same story done over and over again enough times. The movie is fun with a brilliant cast. Burton does his most imaginative work even if we didn't really need a big fight between good and evil in an Alice and Wonderland movie. All of that felt like a combination of Narnia and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />  I've seen some reviews where dumb critics say Depp was the only good thing about the movie. He was good, but I don't think it was his best work. I don't know why his Mad Hatter had accent on and off that makes him sound like a leprechaun. Hell, he even occasionally sounded a lot like BeetleJuice. Other than that, he was perfect in the role. However, the film would be less effective if Wasikowska wasn't cast as Alice. She's a real find and was excellent as Alice, she was possibly even the best I've seen. I'd love to see a Burton remake of the Wizard of Oz, but only if he doesn't think the Wizard of Oz would need an big epic battle between good and evil. It would also be nice to get a break from Depp and Helen Bohen Carter in everything he does. We don't need Carter as the Wicked Witch and Depp as the Scare Crow.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I am not only a Michael Buble fan, I am also myself a former professional singer. I think the thing I appreciate the most about Buble is that he is willing to take chances with his interpretations. I also know from seeing him in live performance that the man is a complete professional, a true artist, and knows how to connect with the music and his audience. I appreciate all those qualities. To me, that's what makes an artist true to his craft.     I am for the most part pleased with all the cuts on this new CD, but a couple of them I find myself skipping over as they are just a bit too lackluster for my taste. Here's my breakdown; 'Cry Me a River' is brilliant. It is by far the best cut on the CD, closely followed by 'All I Do is Dream of You' (what a great treatment of an old classic!). Both arrangements are genius. 'All of Me' is a great take on a great standard. I am not enthralled with 'Georgia', 'Crazy Love', or 'Baby, You've Got What it Takes'. But 'Haven't Met You Yet' is so infectious I find myself humming it all the time, which to me is a hallmark of great songwriting. 'Heartache Tonight' is fabulous as is 'You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You'. And 'Stardust' has a most interesting treatment, though not the best I've heard. And I am so attached to that song, I know it inside out. Which leads me to one of my few criticisms of Mr. Buble; I wish he would stop messing around with the lyrics on standards. I can understand and appreciate changing a lyric occasionally to lend a certain emphasis, but he does it constantly. What I find ends up happening then is that novices who then proceed to learn these songs from him learn the lyrics wrong, and over time the lyrics then become bastardized. Not what the composer intended, I assure you! Please Michael, just sing it correctly at least the first time in the song, then you can change it around to suit your interpretation. Sorry, this is just a pet peeve of mine and I hate it that one of the new champions of classicmusic of this sort resorts to this.     One more thing; I am completely put off by 'Hold On', but then I was not a big fan of his composition 'Home' either. They just sound like songwriter night material to me, which usually ends up being the dregs left over after the good stuff gets kept by the producer. Stick with the uptempo material, Michael! You're a good writer, I'm just not a fan of your ballads.

1400052173|5.0|I usually prefer fiction, but few fiction novels could equal this true story of the woman whose cells made possible so many scientific advances. Her family's attempts to come to terms with her death and to truly understand what happened to Henrietta and her cells is an intriguing and totally absorbing story. Through the story of this family we also understand a bit of what life was like for African Americans in the 50's, how tricky race relations can be even 50 years later, and how important education is for individuals to truly understand their rights. If you don't find yourself questioning the limits of scientific experimentation and the extent of individual rights and medical privacy after finishing this book, you haven't been paying attention.     Skloot is a fantastic writer. The science is easy to understand, and the family is portrayed with real understanding. Highly recommended.    One of the Lacks family's issues was the lack of recognition given to Henrietta's contribution to medical science. I doubt many people would disagree with them, and I'm somewhat amazed that Johns Hopkins University hasn't already established a scholarship for African American students who study biology and/or want to go into medicine. Their Development staff would seem to have a fertile hunting ground amid all the companies who have made millions from this woman's cells, and who might want to balance the scales a wee bit by contributing to such a fund.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This film has all the ingredients for a perfect historical drama.  Yes, it's a drama, and not a documentary.  Complete historical accuracy is not the objective.  But I believe this one comes closer than most.  I'm thankful that they veered away from one point of accuracy:  Queen Victoria wasn't very attractive, even in her youth.  Emily Blunt, on the other hand, is stunning.    As others have pointed out, Emily Blunt and especially Rupert Friend are VERY good in their roles, and all the supporting actors are equally (although maybe not as surpisingly, considering who they are) superb.  The costumes and scenery are perfect.  The plot is very intriguing, abetted by the incredible on-screen chemistry between Blunt and Friend.    Rupert Friend's performance was maybe the most striking aspect of the film.  The role of Albert is very difficult (both the role for the real-life Albert and for any actor portraying him through this time period).  Friend nailed every scene he was in, from the awkwardness of the initial meeting, in which he was both way over-prepared and way under-prepared, to the put-down by his wife when she found him over-stepping what she perceived to be his role.  And somehow he played the junior partner without coming across as some sort of modern liberated man.    It's surprising that this tale has not been told over and over in film (although there have been some earlier versions) -- it seems tailor-made for the screen.  But maybe that's yet another tribute to the quality of this production.  I purchase almost no DVDs anymore, but I'm buying this one because it'll be much cheaper than renting it all the times I'm likely to want to see it again!

B0030Y11XS|1.0|He's back and he's madder than ever.  Why?  Mr. Moore is the beneficiary of all facets of the American System.  He can spew his vitriol with complete freedom.  He is a multi-millionaire thanks to our CAPITALIST system (or perhaps he'd be happier making films in Cuba, with the State claiming all profits).  Our top-of-the-line health care system keeps his blood pressure under 200/100.  And it sure doesn't look like he's been missing too many meals.  But, for some reason, he's dedicated his life to an attempt to tear down America.  I saw him on TV the other day; it seems his latest target is Obama, whom Mikey now feels isn't being far-left enough.  In this film he claims to be exposing capitalism's faults, but what he's exposing isn't the system but plain, old-fashioned corruption therein.  And we all know there's no corruption in countries under the sway of Mikey's beloved communism. Right, Mikey?

That in itself is a comforting thought, that we can have our own heaven and we can watch our family from somewhere else...well, that was enough to take the sadness away.  A truly good book, one you will have trouble putting down from beginning to end.
0307266303|5.0|As I began to read the first chapter in this book I was immediately mesmerized.  The stories linking each athlete I found thrilling.  Specifically, the mind body connection and 'easy to understand' information about long distance running was helpful.  Overall, the book was well written and one I didn't want to put down.  If you are a runner or curious about the mind body connection of the best athletes, this is a must read!
B001UV4XX8|5.0|It was really good and I think I have a pretty good handle on the story even though I was high when I saw it. People must have gone into this movie thinking it would be a run-of-the-mill thriller but it was actually way better than that.
B00005JKCH|4.0|For its time, Spider-Man (2002) is an impressive technical achievement, as well as an entertaining, straight ahead action film.  Director Sam Raimi's interpretation of the vanguard of Marvel Comics, while a pretty good thrill ride, is open to much discussion, as he reconfigures the Spider-Man universe.<br /><br />Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Dikto, back in 1963, and has become an icon among comic book superheroes.  In 1967, Spider-Man appeared in an animated series, that captured much of the basic essence of the character, and helped to boost his popularity.  The short lived 1978 TV series, demonstrated that realistically translating the character to live action, would be a major technical challenge.  It would not be until after another twenty years had passed, that technology would advance far enough to make bringing the webslinger to the big screen possible.<br /><br />With nearly forty years of history behind Spider-Man, the challenge was to decide what to focus on, and how to present the characters.  While the screenplay gets some things right, there are other matters that do not play as well, as Spidey's life story gets a major makeover.  The film takes the traditional route, starting at the beginning, with a retelling of the origin of the character, and after setting the stage, Act II focuses on Spider-Man's battle with the Green Goblin.<br /><br />Casting was a crucial process, and after appearing as Spider-Man in three films, I have mixed feelings about Toby Maguire.  Not so much with his performance as Spider-Man, but mostly as Peter Parker.  His voice sounds too boyish, and his portrayal does not match my conception of the character.  The writing is a major contributor to this, as Maguire's Parker comes off as more of a shy, clumsy, lovesick goof, rather than as teen struggling with coming to terms with being a superhero.  The angst and inner conflict that Parker had in the early days (the first 100 issues of The Amazing Spider-Man), as well as Spidey's irreverent sense of humor, is completely missing.  As is having to deal with financial troubles, and Aunt May's health concerns.  While going in that direction might have dragged down the movie, even a critical element like Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), is glossed over.<br /><br />In the 1960's era comics, Mary Jane was an outgoing swinger type, and bears little resemblance to the confusingly written 'good girl' character we have here.  Peter is her neighbor for 12 years, yet she hardly knows him, and then he suddenly becomes her soulmate?  Kirsten Dunst does a good job with the role as written.  The issue is not with her performance, but again like Maguire, with the writing.  Peter's love interest in the early comics was Betty Brandt, followed by Gwen Stacy.  However, involving those characters would have probably been too complicated, particularly as the focus in the film is on Parker's high school life.  Peter is made to appear to be afraid of girls, but in the comics he was more preoccupied with other matters, and regarded as a 'square', rather than being afraid.  While the rationale for some of these decisions is understandable, the mixed up timeline, and the jumble of partial truths with fiction, can be hard for aficionados of the older comics to accept.<br /><br />Listening to the comments by Raimi, John Dykstra, and others, it often sounds like they are selling a bill of goods.  Repeatedly we hear things like Norman Osborn is like Peter's 'surrogate father', and that he favors Peter over his own son.  Osborn offers to help Peter as Harry's roommate, but actually does nothing for him on a personal level.  Willem Dafoe is an exceptional choice for the Osborn/Green Goblin role, but the Goblin's costume is ridiculous joke, looking like a shiny vinyl lizard that is hard to look at without laughing.  It's too bad, because the Goblin maneuvers very well on his glider, and his pumpkin bombs are extremely stylish.  When the Goblin knocks Spidey unconscious, in what universe is it possible, that while helpless, the Goblin didn't take the opportunity to peek under his mask?  Wouldn't you?<br /><br />Unlike the Goblin, Spider-Man's costume looks fabulous, although it is apparently not very durable, and the mask seems very prone to damage.  Later in Spider-Man 2, the mask comes off so often as to be completely ridiculous.  The special effects do a good job of recreating the kind of radical movements Spidey is capable of.  He is almost flying across the skyline of New York.  Peter's ability to create his own webbing, versus man made web shooters, is more in line with the DNA angle to his origin, and simplifies things for the filmmakers.<br />Revealing some of the deficiencies of Spider-Man, is the sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is a much better film, particularly from a technical standpoint, where both Spidey and Dr. Octopus, do some amazing things.  Unfortunately all three Spider-Man films, display an unfortunate pattern regarding the mortality of super-villains.<br /><br />Sam Raimi definitely deserves a lot of credit for what he has achieved with the Spider-Man franchise.  The films are spectacular, and very entertaining, and have forever lifted him from the ranks of cult horror films.  With a history so long and rich, there will be issues regarding Spider-Man, no matter what road is taken.  Raimi seems to have carte blanche regarding the character, and the films are rewriting Spider-Man's history in quite significant ways.  It is apparent that the PG-13 films, are targeted squarely at a young audience, who have different tastes, and may have never read a Spider-Man comic.

In the end, while the film successfully delivers Spider-Man, it falls very much short in depicting the lives of the real life characters.Spidey unconscious, in what universe is it possible, that while helpless, the Goblin didn't take the opportunity to peek under his mask?  Wouldn't you?        Unlike the Goblin, Spider-Man's costume looks fabulous, although it is apparently not very durable, and the mask seems very prone to damage.  Later in Spider-Man 2, the mask comes off so often as to be completely ridiculous.  The special effects do a good job of recreating the kind of radical movements Spidey is capable of.  He is almost flying across the skyline of New York.  Peter's ability to create his own webbing, versus man made web shooters, is more in line with the DNA angle to his origin, and simplifies things for the filmmakers.    Revealing some of the deficiencies of Spider-Man, is the sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is a much better film, particularly from a technical standpoint, where both Spidey and Dr. Octopus, do some amazing things.  Unfortunately all three Spider-Man films, display an unfortunate pattern regarding the mortality of super-villains.      Sam Raimi definitely deserves a lot of credit for what he has achieved with the Spider-Man franchise.  The films are spectacular, and very entertaining, and have forever lifted him from the ranks of cult horror films.  With a history so long and rich, there will be issues regarding Spider-Man, no matter what road is taken.  Raimi seems to have carte blanche regarding the character, and the films are rewriting Spider-Man's history in quite significant ways.  It is apparent that the PG-13 films, are targeted squarely at a young audience, who have different tastes, and may have never read a Spider-Man comic.  The decisions made here were crucial, as they established the framework for the films that follow, and will become 'reality' for those who have no other frame of reference.      Raimi had great power in deciding what to do, but did he live up to the responsibility of doing justice to Spider-Man?  In the end, while the film successfully delivers Spider-Man, it falls very much short in depicting the lives of the real life characters.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|The chemistry between Villazon and Netrebko is electrifying. Placido is showing his age but as always with his warm and strong voice.  Loved it.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|I'm only 25 mins in and the movie is just plain bad. I don't care of the rest of the movie is good, there's no excuse for this much flaw already in the beginning of the movie. A good movie, a real good movie, is good throughout.    To sum it up it was extremely rushed mixed with horrible acting (main character is just bad) and horrible directing.    Example?    Don't need one. Watch it yourself and you'll either see it or you don't. If you don't see it and you think this movie is awesome than good for you, I'm just glad I can see. Thank god I didn't watch this in the theater, movies like these are just asking for.    Predictable, corny, typical. Like always I'm expecting major disagreement but it's okay. 95% of the population doesn't know whats good from bad, I just hope one in ten of you find some sort of agreement. This movie is BAD.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|Contains spoilers     From what I've heard from fans, the Sookie Stackhouse stories have not traveled well to the screen. Having not read any of Charlaine Harris' novels myself, I can't say. But, given what the first season of 'True Blood' has to offer, I am loath to doubt the veracity of such comments.     In short, what we have here is a bog standard \\"which man will the girl choose\\" type of story, intermingled with some OTT Hollywood Sex(tm) and some superfluous vampires and other assorted mythical creatures, all set in some Southern backwater (complete with truly terrible accents). The basic premise of the vampire as \\"minority\\" coming \\"out of the coffin\\" is a pretty good one, but it not is elaborated on enough here. There was so much more that could have been done with that idea. But it gets somewhat abandoned, in favor of yet another shot of naked flesh or another sex scene. All of which becomes really tiresome after a while. Don't get me wrong, sex has its place in movies and TV. But, like gore, when it's done just for the sake of it (as it is here) it can become boring and obvious (as it is here). In addition, the obsession with sex and the vampire has lost its umph years ago. Vampires are dead, they can't have sex. It's unbelievably juvenile and renders the vampires \\"impotent\\" in their fear factor. Put it like this, I doubt anyone would want to get it on with one of the vampires in '30 Days of Night', which is a far superior take on the subject. In that movie, they are scary and something you really don't want to be around. In 'True Blood', they have no scare at all.     Also, there's way too much time wasted on characters that really should be incidental, like Jason (sookie's dim witted brother), who is a truly wretched character. I know he's been turned into the prime suspect of a murder case, but the lack of evidence in that is laughable and certainly doesn't warrant the amount of time he's present onscreen. Likewise, for Tara. The standard issue \\"angry black person\\". What a tired cliché. although, at least her character has some progress throughout the series. Her alcoholic mother, too, is another un-necessary road trip that I could have done without.     Lafayette, on the other hand, works very well. But, I am given to understand that in the books, he is nothing like the character portrayed in the series.     The heart of the show...the vampires...are, unfortunately, such a miserable lot. They are the modern day \\"feeling sorry for themselves\\" neo-goth versions. In other words, extremely irritating. But there are some good moments with them. When people aren't trying to screw them, they are allowed to have their shot onscreen and it can be done well, as in the tribunal held for vampire Bill (ha ha, still laugh at that) at the end of the series. Or, when the scene shifts to \\"Fangtasia\\", the bar where the vampires hang out. In \\"Fangtasia\\", we meet Eric, who is a sheriff of sorts for the region and is destined to have some altercation with Bill, after the interesting scene where the vampires use Sookie's telepathy for their own ends. Regrettably, the vampires have few opportunities to be menacing, which ultimately makes their inclusion in the story somewhat pointless.     It's not all bad though. I have to say that I was actually interested in where the story went, even if it was nothing more than a love story wrapped up in unusual clothes. There are enough hooks to keep the viewer coming back and enough \\"interest\\" to justify that extra hour's watching, when you really should be going to bed! However, I doubt I will be watching Season 2. Which, after all is the \\"true\\" test of a series.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|This series is quite simply pure class. Centered around the advertising & macho corporate world of New York in 1960, from the costume design all the way through to the story this is a must for people who enjoy adult drama.<br />The pace is fairly slow to begin with but sets the scene perfectly as the season draws to its climax. The main character is extremely complex, interesting and never fails to leave you astounded. No surprise he has won multiple awards for his performances (notably Golden Globes). The way women are portrayed is extremely unsettling for people born after this generation but I'm sure hits the mark. Wouldn't be great if we could still sip whiskey at work while updating our Outlook accounts!<br />Fantastic series & looking forward to Season 2 & 3.<br />At the discounted price this is a MUST!

If you have a blu-ray player you should be okay. Likewise I expect Playstation 3 owners are probably catered for. Clearly this is an attempt by the authors of the disc to cut-out owners of generic HTPC machines.<br /><br />This disc is made for Sony Corporation so I strongly suspect this is a deliberate, malicious attempt to cut out people using HTPC's. Please comment if you are having success or failure with your HTPC so we can get an accurate understanding of the problem.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I loved the Zoom H4N, until I bought the H1 (for the Fall 2016 semester, to record lectures).  Yes, the H4N is supposedly a more &#34;professional&#34; device.  But the H1 powers up in about a second.  The H4N takes more than a minute (!) before it is ready to use - slow boot.  Plus, it eats batteries like crazy, and leaves the display backlit when it doesn't need to.  I recorded three hours of college lectures, and the two Lithium rechargeable AA batteries still read full.  The H4N would be on it's second set of batteries by now.  PLUS, I have a whole semester of unintelligible WAV file audio from the H4N, and, in the same environment, the H1 is making stellar MP3's (where the H4N had problems making MP3s that would play back and not sound like mud).  I would give my H4N to some dumb kid, as long as I can keep my H1:  the new best from Zoom!

B002N5N4M6|5.0|In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: \\"I AM SHELDON\\"!<br /><br />Well into its third season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is consistently brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br />Best SEASON 3 moment (a very hard choice to make): attempting to condition Penny using positive reinforcement (chocolates) - but was also open to \\"mild electric-shocks with almost imperceptible tissue damage\\" to have her ready by dinner-time.<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny.<br />Best SEASON 3 moment: getting high on hash-cookies while on an asteroid-gazing camp-trip and rambling that he 'd rather have a different name as Leonard sounds like having \\"nerd\\" in it.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br />Best SEASON 3 moment: turning into Gothowitz by use of fake tattoo-sleeves to pick up \\"easy morbid Goth girls\\".<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the \\"poor Indian\\" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.<br />Best SEASON 3 moment: wearing a T-shirt with a small speaker and a large selection of sound-effects, he uses it brilliantly to dramatize his answers. HOWARD: \\"But Sheldon, you ARE guilty\\". RAJEH: \\"[playing the Law & Order Doom-DOOM]!\\"<br /><br />Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends - and from her neighbors.<br />Best SEASON 3 moment: waiting at the hospital with Sheldon taking her medical history. \\"Migraines?\\" \\"Well, I'm getting one now!\\"<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!pick up \\"easy morbid Goth girls\\".

B000007ODL|5.0|THE VERY BEST OF J.J. CALE (aka THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION) is a great 20-song anthology of Tulsa, OK's other famous export (Leon Russell is also from Tulsa). It includes his chart hits and songs made famous by other artists, such as \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" (Lynyrd Skynyrd), \\"After Midnight\\" (Eric Clapton), and \\"Cocaine\\" (Clapton again). It could be said that Cale deserves a more extensive retrospective, but the man himself doesn't seem to mind. Of course, you can hunt down the double-disc anthology ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS if you so desire, but this is a great collection of great music by a great artist.

B00009RAJH|5.0|This is a great remaster of the first Fleetwood Mac album to feature guitarist-singer-songwriter Lindsey Buckingham and singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks. The two provided the band with a much-needed shot in the arm as far as musical muscle was concerned, as Buckingham also co-produced the album with Keith Olsen, brightening up what had been an increasingly murky sound. Nicks also brought a unique lyrical vision to the band, with her mystical imagery. This is a great album made even better by modern technology and a few bonus cuts.

So--yes, some songs in this package I already own--HOWEVER--alot of these  songs have very different arrangements (whether live or in studio): thus I feel like I'm hearing a bit of Everett's creative process--which fascinates me.  I find every track in this package interesting.  If you're a songwriter you can learn much from listening to Mark's music and lyrics.    \\"USELESS TRINKETS...\\" is a wonderfully put together package--I really dig the photos and notes about each song. I am also surprised how much I enjoy hearing E sing songs NOT written by him, but he makes them his own.  \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" (made famous by Elvis) will break your heart--in a good way--you'd think E wrote it himself: his voice and piano are  beautiful and the writer of this song would be pleased to hear E's rendition.  I LOVE THIS PACKAGE and I'm so happy I bought it.   However, if you are not familiar with The Eels you may want to start with something else, (perhaps \\"Electro Shock Blues\\").  Keep 'em coming Mark!  (Your book is also outstanding!)

1573229725|3.0|I bought and read this book on the recommendation of a friend and I will attempt to give a little review of it here without giving away much of anything.<br /><br />The book itself is divided into three parts.  The first part covers the POV from the character Sue and her plot in the Lilly's home.  The chapters of this part show the gradual building of a relationship between Sue and Maud who is the mark of a very cold-hearted plot.  The first part of this book however ended with a twist that was so shocking that it left me with unrealistic hopes for the second part.<br /><br />During the second part there was a lot of backtracking, the second part of the book goes over many of the scenes from the first part of the book except this time fixed to Maud's POV.  This is at many times tiresome although it does show the reader a number of variations on how scenes should be taken.  Still, it wore on me to have to re-read it all again in chronological order.  However after the re-hash this part of the book continues onward following Maud and her adventures in London.  This section also has a twist that is fairly major but nearly unbelievable and the book lost a lot of credibility with me at this point.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far.  The plot itself was considerably more intricate than it needed to be and it only left the reader going 'what the heck?'  If I would have had to rate the book after section two I would have only given it two stars whereas after section on it would have been a 5 star book.<br /><br />The final second of the book covers Sue once again in the picture and her struggle to regain what she had lost.  The two main characters once again get a chance to interact and the twist that was hinted at during the conclusion of the second section is revealed and is again almost beyond belief to the point where I was shouting at the book.  But, it was better than the explanations provided for the twist in section two.  The two overall longings for the reader in this story are finally resolved, one of them with great gratification, the Gentleman (proper name) gets what the readers want him to get, but the second more important resolution that the reader wants holds off until there are only a few pages left.  It's rushed and gives only a hint of the fulfillment it could have given with a more proper page count.<br /><br />So, overall it made for some decent reading but also a decent amount of frustration.  At times especially at the end things feel rushed but at other times chapters and plot points just drag on without resolution or clarification where other things are explained in great detail.  The writing style would be a little lacking for some of the more refined wordsmiths out there but it is on the upper end of works of lesbian fiction.  I would recommend reading this book but it's certainly not a favorite.der in this story are finally resolved, one of them with great gratification, the Gentleman (proper name) gets what the readers want him to get, but the second more important resolution that the reader wants holds off until there are only a few pages left.

0385504225|2.0|As it turned out, Dan Brown had squandered a golden opportunity to enthrall his readers with this much anticipated Robert Langdon novel. He also managed to mar his reputation as a serious writer and entertainer with the exceedingly bad characters, including Robert Langdon's, with which this book is rife. As much as I enjoyed reading Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I'm afraid Mr. Brown has \\"lost\\" me with this one.<br /><br />With that said, I did enjoy some aspects of the book. I'll start with what I liked first.<br /><br />Dan Brown is known to load up his books with a ton of research on the subjects in question (i.e. Vatican, Rome and Catholicism in Angels and Demons; Christianity, Paris, Jesus and Knights Templar in The Da Vinci Code) and this book is no exception. I really enjoyed reading about the Masons and their history and rituals. I also got to learn about Noetic Science, which I didn't realize existed prior to reading this book. Brown's descriptions of Washington D.C. and the Capitol were immersive and fascinating in the same measure.<br /><br />But then we had to deal with characters and plot, which brings us to the portion of this review where I get to tell you what I didn't like about the book.<br /><br />Aside from the fascinating research, everything else was one bad joke after another. The characters, especially Robert Langdon's, were vapid to put it lightly and sadly inconsequential. For the better half of the book, Langdon was inexplicably balking at concepts that a man with his experience (from Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code) would simply not have. Seriously, most of Robert Langdon's lines were a variation of, \\"yes, but that doesn't make sense\\" that's shortly thereafter followed by, \\"God, now it all makes sense.\\"<br /><br />And to add insult to injury, the plot was a mess. It was too predictable, weak and embarrassingly contrived.<br /><br />I was really disheartened to see such cheap and amateurish work put out by a writer with such a huge platform. You may enjoy reading this book just for the research that's put into it. But if good character development and believable plots are important to you, The Lost Symbol will end up being lost time you wish you get back.ok just for the research that's put into it.

1400052173|5.0|I read this book faster than I normally do (and I read fast).  This is the most amazing book I have read in a long time.  I found it similar in style of the books And the Band Played On by Randy Shilts or A Civil Action by Jonathan Harr.  This is not a book about cancer (although I am battling it now) but a story to me about love and the medical community.  I learned a great deal but thought it was all presented so easily for understanding but also in equality to both the medical community but also to the Lacks family. If it had not been for Entertainment Weekly's profile, I may not have found this book.  It is a must read!

1439148953|3.0|Migration, enchantment, disenchantment, love, loss, joy and death, corporeal and otherwise, all evocatively presented.  From seasickness to the attainment of modest but worthy goals, we are taken on a journey that it is impossible for us, with all our transportation and communications systems, to recall, though the story occurs within the living memory of many.  If the devil is in the details, so is the divine, at least within this tale.  I must say I disagree with those who find the protagonist to be passive: what is passive about giving up one's homeland and striking out for parts unknown?      I had been curious about the author for some time and now understand why he has garnered so many accolades.  I look forward to reading more.  However, note to the author and his editors:  \\"Mass,\\" when used to describe a religious service, is a proper noun, whether you like it or not.

No, I won't admit to the cost of the Japanesse releases!  I am so impressed by this CD.  Gil didn't recruit those who owe him their careers, he released an album on his terms.  You won't find anything like it out today, not because it isn't good, it is beyond good!  Beat poetry with a touch of rap and a dash of jazz,...and a twist of country!  All things considered, this is a masterpiece!  Street sounds abound woven in like a hot summer night.  Props to his grandma for taking care of him and props to Gil for sending her his love.  Gils life has been a hard one marked by drugs and jail but in the end we are all richer for his insight and his guts.  This is only a sign of things to come.  I can only dream of his next release and hope that the Grammys can figure out a category to give I'm New Here and Gil the attention they deserve.

Everything about her and the band was a delight. She used the work rockabilly for some of the songs and blues for the others. The best comment I could make is that one work cannot describe their style or talent. I am a causual listener of rocabilly & blues but Imelda makes it something completely her own. They were just an amazing live band to watch. Oh yeah - the CD is great too (picked it up at the concert).

B002SF9YNO|5.0|Just watched this film last night at the international cinema at my university. I also play the cello so I decided to go see this movie on a whim after seeing a poster displayed for it. I had no idea what it was about, but I found it humorous and touching. I feel this film gives a good insight to part of Japanese culture and parts of its beautiful landscape. Beautiful Japanese proverbs and customs are displayed in this film, the sort of gems I want to share with my family and friends. This film makes me want to visit Japan, I had no idea how beautiful the landscape is out in the country in Japan. All the characters are refreshing and feel like real people I know. The main actor does a great job of faking his ability to play the cello, I had no idea he couldn't play till I started looking up this film on the internet after I watched it. This film made me cry, in the best heart warming way it could. As another reviewer put it, it did not overly manipulate the audience, but the characters performance drew us in to the emotions of their families. I love this film and will be getting it on DVD. I highly suggest viewing it.

1439190275|5.0|Years ago I gave the Atkins diet a try and lost 65 pounds at a fast rate, unfortunately like many, I never moved past the first phase of the program and went back to my old ways of eating.  Over time I gained all the weight back and then some.  At 275 pounds at the start of July, I decided to give it another try.  I picked up my 2002 version of the Atkins book and started reading it.  I also went to the [...] website and discovered a wonderful forum community that I visit each day to communicate with others living this lifestyle.  Much to my surprise I discovered throughout the years more research and studies had been performed I was now suppose to eat more vegetables than I previously thought, not near as much protein.  I took the knowledge from both sources and have now dropped 76 pounds, am eating healthy whole foods, and am never hungry or lacking energy.  Not to mention I look pretty good. In fact, with the motivation I get from my new size and from members on the forum, I recently started exercising much more.    The great thing about this book is the fact that it brings all the information past and present into one easy read book.  Written so everyone can understand the process and the science behind this program.  If you are overweight and truly want to do something about it, buy this book and start a new lifestyle.  Don't believe the hype throughout the years about low carb dieting being the death of us all.  Look what low fat - high carb dieting has done to the world.  My doctor told me as far as he knows nobody has every died from eating to many vegetables and reasonable amounts of protein. Pick up this book and change your life!
0670021652|5.0|Ahhhh, marriage and committment, Elizabeth Gilbert gives a beautiful and realistic view of the history of marriage and relationships. I felt that there was an honesty that she writes about regarding the nuances of being with a person that you love. Loving relationships are not always pretty or rational in behavior, and it takes two people who can see what you love about each other, rather than criticize the flaws. She talks candidly about flaws and fears and the impact that has on each other, and the impact that has on trying to get along each day. It is a beautiful and real love story, told in a manner that does not glorify it at all, and that I appreciated most about this book, and her writing.  Hats off to her for an enjoyable read on what it means to be in a committed relationship.
0439023491|4.0|**spoiler alert** Catching Fire seemed like a repeat of the first but I still found myself at the edge of my seat throughout most of the book. I was floored when Katnis and Peeta found themselves right back in the games! The games themselves could have been a little more suspenseful but I thought it was a very well written book. I do hope that in the next installment Collins brings Gale's character to life because I am not believing the love triangle at all. You just don't see enough of him and Kat together to really get a feel for their love. One other thing I wish was brought more into the book was the revolution. I felt like Collins focused a lot of the book on the games and not enough on the uprising. I am very excited to read the next book since I have a feeling that it will be centered around taking the capital down! Team Peeta all the way!
B001CTDH76|5.0|The series is a good mix of mystery, drama, action, and comedy mixed together for each episode to make the first season an addictive show from the first episode to the last one of the set.  The sly wit and smarmy attitude of Simon Baker's character really is a joy to watch and the other cast characters are great as well as he matches his way of doing things with the leader of the team of elite detectives he helps out in their cases as you see him ply his trade of renown attention to details and evidence(A Little like the show Psych) which he once used when he played as a fake psychic and now uses these skills to solve crimes.  The video and audio are crystal clear and the extras are pretty good for the price of the set.  So if you're a fan of shows like Monk or Psych here's another great series collection to add to those great shows as well...
B00006RSM1|4.0|A UK version of a 2002 compilation album on a single disc that was not enhanced and contained songs from the highly successful Californian era (1975 onwards), but only a few songs from the Peter Green-led blues period. Only the US 2002 release contained a multimedia bonus, playable on most computers, including special music videos, interviews, discography, vaults, and a password to the special website. The songs &#34;Hold Me&#34;, &#34;As Long As You Follow&#34;, and &#34;No Questions Asked&#34;, included in the very sucessful 1988 &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; album, were not in this compilation.
0385523904|5.0|I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone curious about how North Koreans are doing and what life is like in a totalitarian state.  The author tracks the lives of six individuals who managed to escape the famine and mind control associated with Kim Jong-Il's regime.      First, the author presents life in North Korea for each of these individuals.  One is a doctor, another a student, one is a day-care worker, another is a housewife who lost her husband to starvation, another is a regular troublemaker in North Korea, and another is an orphan who grew up on the streets.  In seeing North Korea through the eyes of each of these individuals, the reader learns how neighbors spy on neighbors, how radios and televisions are preset to government stations only, how an intricate class structure based on loyalty to the Dear Leader keeps down talent.  The reader also learns about what life is like when there is not enough food to go around.  I recall reading how the doctor, who had just crossed into China, saw a bowl full of rice and meat laid out for a dog to eat.  The doctor had mixed feelings at that moment, realizing that so many of her propagandist beliefs were wrong and also realizing that her training and education were hopelessly obsolete.  So many things in North Korea are shoddy, ill-made, hazardous, and downright dangerous--the regime can barely keep the lights on during a small portion of the day, for example.      Second, the author tracks these individuals once they make it out of North Korea.  Some of them lose the repatriation money the South Korean government provided them; others struggle to find work and stability; others pine for their families back home.  I loved the details of the housewife, and how her daughter, the `bad' daughter, arranged to bring her through China and into South Korea.       Finally, the author considers the difficulties the Korean peninsula will face when the regime ultimately collapses.  The author does not predict that a collapse is just around the corner; on the contrary, she seems to say that this situation will continue potentially through another generation, at least.      All in all, a very readable book.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I can hardly add to all of the positive comments made about this brilliant, classic Godfather trilogy.  It can be viewed over and over and still has something to offer each time.  The added features are equally interesting and entertaining.  This is a must buy addition to your movie library.  The other great thing about it is that the viewer is transported throughout time from the beginning of the family into the 1970's or 80's.  This has to be one of the best all time movie trilogies ever produced.  It gets a very big 5 stars from me.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombieland stars a hypochondriacal nerd whose life is forever altered when his hot neighbor seeks his help after being bit by a homeless man. Of course, you guessed it. Said hot chick becomes a zombie and our hero must fight her off and learn the world has changed... And not for the better.<br /><br />I thought this wa a light amusing zombie film. I especially thought the first 2/3rds was good. I enjoyed the hero's interraction with the Tallahassee. I was 'meh' about the love interest. In fact, aside from the initial scene where the two girls met our nerdy hero, too much time was spent with her and her kid sister. They weren't bad or anything. But I liked the interraction with Tallahassee more.<br /><br />I shaved a star off this because I thought the final quarter of this film lost momentum and became rather humdrum. Up until that point, this was amusing and fun horror-lite. It started to get silly during the scenes involving Bill Murray.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|The serious side of anime never ceases to amaze. From the director of \\"Perfect Blue\\" comes a Christmas story which is full of personal introspection, twists and turns. The character development is excellent. Gin's tragic trail of alcholism, the young girls adolescent frustration with her home life that has driven her to the streets, and the dreams and the hopes of a transvestite who wants from the world what her body cannot give. These persons come to peace with this personal strife by trying to find the parents of a baby they found while rummaging in the trash.<br />  It's a triumph.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|What an eye opening film. I applaud the filmmakers and participants who have told this much needed story. I am upset and disappointed at how these companies, the government, and consumers have allowed creation of scientifically generated foods to land on our tables. We all, at some point, have contributed to this horrible production of food. I believe consumers have had the least involvement in this madness but hold the most power for change, as the film indicates.<br /><br />The two stories that stood out for me were the mother/daughter team who lost a son/grandson due to E-coli, and the owner of Polyface Farms (I belive his name was Jim). I applaud this mother/daughter team and my heart goes out to their cause. I just loved the enthusiasm and devotion of Polyface Farms to maintain a 'natural' ecological focus for what he produces. Polyface educates us as to the importance of why we should eat organically. And don't forget those GMO's (not associated with Polyface)...you've got to hear about that one!<br /><br />I was already on course for eating well, but this has just put me over the fence as to why I should eat organically. I could go on and on about this subject but you need to see for yourself and make your own decisions. A MUST SEE. Well done!<br /><br />Cheryl<br />[...]
B002P8O29K|5.0|If you haven't seen THE ROLLING STONES: GIMME SHELTER (CRITERION COLLECTION BLU-RAY) it's an iconic documentary filmed by famed movie-maker brothers David and Albert Maysles ([[ASIN:B00018D2X8 The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit]], [[ASIN:B000E5LEVK Grey Gardens / The Beales of Grey Gardens - Criterion Collection (2-disc set)]]) that was supposed to feature \\"The Rolling Stones\\" in concert at Altamount Speedway in Northern California.<br /><br />What was going to be the West Coast's answer to [[ASIN:B001V9LRV0 Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)]] ended up being something far more sinister as people experienced bad acid trips and the Hell's Angels roughed up audience members and performers. It eventually ends with a stabbing death that's caught on film in this documentary.<br /><br />GIMME SHELTER not only shows the Rolling Stones in concert at various venues before heading into Altamont, but it also shows the wheeling and dealing that went on behind-the-scenes to get the concert off the ground. And it films the reaction of the Stones, particularly Mick Jagger, to the stabbing death as the footage is presented to the group after the incident.<br /><br />The documentary is riveting and the event itself has since been touted as the \\"defining\\" moment that brought an end to the Hippie's \\"Peace & Love\\" idealism and what could happen without rules and order.<br /><br />Picture resolution is excellent, but don't expect it to be razor sharp like something that was filmed recently.<br /><br />====  BONUS FEATURES  ====<br /><br />*** KSAN'S RADIO ALTAMONT--(01-hour and 29-minutes)--Indexed & \\"Play All\\"<br />* This is audio only, over a static image, of excerpts from the KSAN radio broadcast that followed the next day after Altamont.

B00275EGX8|5.0|Let's see...first you take a few character actors and put them in lead roles. Then you take [[ASIN:B002Q8GKLM Lord Voldemort]] and put him in a character actor's role. Put the last director that you'd ever think of in charge. And what do you get? In my opinion? You get The Hurt Locker. You get the movie that deserves the Best Picture nod in 2010.<br /><br />Was Director Kathryn Bigalow in Iraq? I have no idea. But she made me believe that I was looking into Iraq at the daily routines of a squad charged with the task of investigating and disarming IEDs (improvised explosive devices).<br /><br />I've heard that the movie has been criticized by war veterans and others actually in Iraq for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions, but this all seemed very real to me. Sure, it seemed like the cast was under fire and constantly dealing with some IED threat, and maybe that's what the critics are referring to. But it's a movie. Liberties were taken to consolidate a term in Iraq into 2 hours.<br /><br />I have to say that I was captivated and on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Action. Camaraderie. Emotion. Excellent story. Great script. Great acting. All from an improbable director whose last memorable movie--albeit another [[ASIN:B0016MOWP0 classic]]--was almost 20 years ago.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is certainly one of the best movies that I've seen in the past year. But I also thought that [[ASIN:B001AVCFK6 Star Trek]] was too, and that's not up for Best Picture...shallow dogs that Academy.<br /><br />Add The Hurt Locker to your cart. Put it on your shelf right in between [[ASIN:B000UJ48UO Full Metal Jacket]] and [[ASIN:B00129H7VS Band of Brothers]].

0439023483|5.0|My first thought about this book is WOW! The Hunger Games pushed me to the edge of my seat then knocked me off. I can not tell you how good it is. I enjoyed this book so much I was obessed with finishing it and reading the next book. I became so involved with the characters, I had to tell myself to step back and take a breath.        The Hunger Games is set in the ruins of North America, in the country of Panem. There are 12 districts and two teenagers from each district, a boy and a girl, are sent to the capital each year to compete in the Hunger Games. In the games everyone must fight to the death, only the winner survives. Join Katniss, Peeta and the others in the Hunger Games and see who survives and who does not. Will the Hunger Games bring Katniss and Peeta together or tear them apart?

0061719544|5.0|I wasn't expecting this memoir to be as well-written as it was, but it is wonderful! I happen to enjoy autobiographies, but even if you aren't an memoir-lover, as long as you are a Craig-lover you will LOVE this. I learned so much about him that he never reveals on the Late Late Show (although some of it, such as the alcoholism and drugs, he does talk about, and is very open and honest on the show about his past), but he has really had a hard life and anyone can sympathize with him. I think a lot of people will relate to him in many ways: his fears, pain, heartbreak, failures, loves and losses. He delves into his past thoroughly and lets you know exactly what he's thinking. Also a great price for a hard cover book! Usually hard covers are at least $25, and I got this for only about $15! A great, very fast read! Once you get into it a bit, you can't put it down, and even if autobiographies bore you, this one will surely change your mind about memoirs! There's so much more to Craig than the silliness and joking side of him on the Late Late Show, he is highly intelligent and has gone through a lot. Enjoy the book!
B0035J6TAI|4.0|For Peter Gabriel, the voice has always been his primary instrument.  Distinctly recognizable in any recording he has ever done, Peter's voice is what fans crave. Laid bare in an orchestral setting, devoid of guitars, drums, and super-synthetic sounds, Scratch My Back is where Peter is right now.<br /><br />It is fun to hear the songs that Peter decided to cover.  Bowie and Eno's Heroes is transformed (twice, once on the main disc and then in another remix) from a pre-electronica rock classic to a quiet journey into the actual lyrics and story of two lovers. As a personal favorite of mine, and hearing many remixes of this song, Peter's cover of Heroes is strongly emotional and the quietest I have heard.  The Talking Head's Listening Wind is another perfect example of another strongly Eno influenced, Byrne produced and performed, song transformed and stripped from its highly produced electronic trappings to its essence and primary voice.  Elbow's original Mirrorball has many Gabriel influences, so Peter's cover is a natural extension of the Elbow version.  Other songs here were less familiar to me, but have made me go out and listen to the originals.<br /><br />Covers often seem to get the cold shoulder.  Maybe it is because some people think the original is the only version, or that the artist covering that song is just taking advantage of a popular song.  Peter does not need to prove anything to anyone.  He is doing what he wants to do.  Peter fans may not like his current incarnation, but be assured that repeated listens will reveal what Mr. Gabriel wants you to hear.  His voice.<br /><br />For me, that memory of songs you have heard so many times before, and hearing how an artist reinterprets those songs is the most interesting thing about covers.  You are not hearing the new version devoid of prior experience, the pleasure pathways were previously greased, blending all versions while altering previous interpretations.  Indeed, Peter Gabriel's own Real World recording label and site have a spot where you can grab individual tracks from selected recordings and remix them anyway you want -- realworldremixed is the place to listen and do your own remixing.<br /><br />I have been on a recent quest for covers, enjoying Nouvelle Vague's versions of 80's songs the most,[[ASIN:B0007YMVOW Nouvelle Vague]] but there are many more out there.

B002Q0F6V0|4.0|While being a Staley fan myself, you cannot deny the genius of Cantrell. I think he was/is the the driving force behind Alice in chains. From his scowling guitar riffs, to his angst-ridden but soothing vocals, Cantrell shows us with this album, he is very capable of moving on without Staley. I prefer him as a vocalist over Staley(even though that's hard for some to believe). IMO it is the best cd I've heard in the last five years, and proof that AIC is back and just as solid as ever. Cantrell has always been one of my favorite vocalist as well as guitar players, and on this fine effort, he again showcases his immense talent.
0061922315|5.0|SECRET DAUGHTER by Shilpi Somaya Gowda is the story of two families from different countries and cultures and the myriad of issues and emotions involved their lives as the result of the adoption of an Indian girl from a Mumbai orphanage.  The story is a beautifully told and simply delivered by the author.<br /><br />Gowda has an interesting way of dealing with the two facets of this story, Indian and American, almost as separate entities but yet, not.  The interweaving and cross over of lives and cultures is ever present and cleverly done.<br /><br />Clearly, the writer's tale of India is much more colorful and compelling in every way than that of the adoptive parents in America.  I came away  with the feeling that Kavita, the biological mother of Usha, had sacrificed so much, not only at the time she takes her daughter to the orphanage to give her up, but also for her entire life.  Her pain is almost unbearable to read, but she carries it with such dignity.  Conversely, Somer comes across as over indulged and pampered, and I found myself feeling sorry that she would be the recipient of this beautiful little girl.  I never felt that the depth of her joy equaled the depth of Kavita's sorrow.  She seemed never to be able to convincingly accept unconditionally the love of this child.  The cultural differences seemed to be always to some degree in the way.  She redeems herself, somewhat, as the book progresses, but I never feel the compassion for Somer that I feel for Kavita and her life.<br /><br />The story is very well told.  The cover of the book is beautiful, filled with the radiance of Indian color and design.  The young woman in her Sari beckons one to follow and enter her world.  The ending is perfect.  It could only have ended this way.<br /><br />I think Ms. Gowda has great insight and knows how to tell a story in a simple and compelling way.  It is difficult to believe that this is her first novel.  I feel certain that she will stand tall among authors.  This book should be in the shelves of all adoptive parents and should be read, as well, by the children they adopt.  I cannot wait to read Gowda's next book.s of all adoptive parents and should be read, as well, by the children they adopt.  I cannot wait to read Gowda's next book.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|I was really expecting this to be a dud. But I was pleasantly surprised that this movie turned out to be fairly good. I really wouldn't label it as a horror film though since I associate \\"horror films\\" as slashing graphic violence and excessive amounts of blood. This movie is more of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" than horror.   In my opinion this film gets you thinking about the whole loop thing and does the main character ever break the loop.  Even though there are plot holes I think that this film is worth a look.   I love that the Taxi driver asks the main character \\"You will come back won't you?\\"   I think that this is a reference to Sisyphus the son of Aeolus.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This was a great book, I read it in about two days.  It's an easy read and a simple style.  I got about halfway through the book before I decided to download it in Portuguese as well.  Now that I'm through the English translation, I've gone back and started to read the Portuguese version.  I would recommend it for anyone who speaks Portuguese as a second language, as lots of Brazilian literature is complex and hard to work through, this book is simple and to the point.
0785134352|4.0|Strangely enough, Mark Millar stated that this tale would show the real-world story of young superheroes fitting into our very own world.  However, this amusing tale is actually more of an early Cohen Brothers/Kill Bill kind of thing as it is so hyper-gory and somewhat absurd that, on the whole, it feels far more panto-esque than some modern, standard superhero fair (for example: Millar's own [[ASIN:0785137807 The Ultimates]]).    But that doesn't mean it's a bad book.  No way, no how.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it quite possibly the best thing that Millar has written, other than his [[ASIN:0785131590 Wolverine: Old Man Logan]] (another hyper-violent story, so you can see what type of comic tale excites me!).    It's a simple enough tale of a teenage comic fan who - finding his normal, superhero-less world far, far more dull than the worlds that are contained within his favourite titles - decides to become a superhero himself.  His first foray into the night-time world of crime-fighting ends in disaster and he realises just how much pain a non-superpowered body can feel when he is beaten to a pulp by some young thugs.    Undeterred he eventually dons his outfit again and - realising that his exploits have bought him fame and also many imitators out of the closet - finds himself mixed up in a messy, gory and, for the reader, fun adventure.    This book is not to be taken seriously.  It's a light but engaging read and references many elements of the normal comic world, as well as the nature of a comic fan's general love and obsession, which is knowing fun for those of us who read a lot of comics but not too distracting for those who don't.    This has been made into a feature film which is out later this year (2010) but I, as a regular lover of the comic medium, would highly recommend a reading of this first.  If anything, some of the elements in this book may well be dealt with with a lighter touch in the movie (judging by the trailer), and unless it has an 18 certificate it may not be anywhere near as bloody - which would rob the story, and it's best character - Hit-Girl - of a rather decent edge that makes this book stand out from the usual slew of superhero titles out there.

B000E6EHGI|5.0|Many of the Grateful Dead's studio albums I would consider to be of far less value than their live performances (American Beauty and Workingman's Dead being the most notable and popular exceptions) but personally I have found Blues For Allah to be nearly as compelling as the live shows from this period, as well as among their finest studio work. Part of the reason I think it's so good is the band took a considerable amount of time off the road during the time they recorded it, allowing them to perfect every detail and really \\"get it right.\\" Almost every song here is filled with a vibrant energy, atmosphere and creativity that is lacking from much of the Dead's albums. It is also rooted heavily in complex jazz fusion. Just check out the opening Help On the Way/Slipknot!, a mind-bending piece that moves through many moods and phases. Just when you think you've got it figured out, the song jumps right into Franklin's Tower, one of my very favorite bouncy Jerry tunes with just beautiful lyrics (\\"may the four winds blow you safely home....\\"). Next comes the RARELY performed King Solomon's Marbles that shows off one of the finest examples of the Dead's instrumental wizardry in the studio. The Music Never Stopped is another personal favorite that is perhaps the most upbeat song on the album, containing many memorable moments (like Jer's great outtro soloing) and more great lyrics. The strong songwriting continues with Crazy Fingers, a pseudo-reggae tune with some of Rober Hunter's most surreal and dreamy lyrics (\\"Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow, tapping at the window\\") and containing some beautiful singing and more great playing. Sage and Spirit is a serene Wier acoustic instrumental that was supposedly used as one of his warm-up exercises. It is also very beautiful. The final song, Blues for Allah, is a spacey chant like tune that while I do find interesting, is a bit disjointed and my least favorite song of the album. Still, this is easily my favorite Dead studio album, and is definitely worth owning.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I did this dvd for 12 days and could really start to see some changes in my strength and muscle tone and I had more energy.  However, on day 12 I strained/sprained my knee and haven't been able to complete the dvd for several days.  You really need to be careful not to overdo it!  Jillian is so encouraging to really push hard and I think I pushed too hard.  If you use caution and don't stress your body too much, I think you will find success.  I like how the dvd is broken down into small sections so that you don't get bored of the same thing over and over.  I'd highly recommend it, just watch the knees!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|my wife bought it and it turned out to be really good.  part count of monte cristo and part se7en.  a hollywood movie that ridicules the flaws of our justice system? yup, and done well.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller came with no scratches or cracks even though I bought it used, I first tried it with the God of War III demo, which I usually play with my original Six Axis. I gotta tell you, that the rumble made everything better,from Kratos' attacks to the movements and footsteps of Perses, the Titan fighting Helios in the background. I can't believe I went this long without rumble.

B001FB55HQ|5.0|This movie was the best movie I have seen in a while.  I will just leave it at that.  The ending you get a very cool surprise.  Can't really explain why it's good but if you like action movies and Terminators then this is the movie for you.

B00008NRL8|3.0|Here it is, seven years after this album was released.    It's an album that gets played maybe once a year.    Usually, it's played for a mellow vibe conducive to background music in social settings or creative situations where music is desired without a lot of distraction.    None of my friends have ever complained, but the album has never made them dance either.    If your into electronic music or tango, this might float your boat. Seven years later it hasn't really hit an emotional chord.
B00006I53S|4.0|I have an XSi and the 50 f1.4 and have been searching for a zoom that  could serve as the one lens that I leave on the camera body most, if  not all the time.   The 50 f1.4 still performs better indoors in low  light, but the 28-135 zoom gives me freedom to vary my compositions  more when there is sufficient light, especially outdoors.  As such,  this two-lens combination is serving me well for my focal length and  environmental needs.  Nowadays, I keep the 28-135 on my camera most of  the time and only use the 50 occasionally as needed indoors.  Two  final notes ... first, you can purchase the 50 plus the 28-135 for  much less than the 17-55, but still have the IQ and a lot of range,  and second, the 28-135 is much better balanced for the XSi than the  17-55 in my opinion.  I am very pleased with the 28-135 as a quality  walkabout lens to complement my 50 prime.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Okay, it's not hip to love films that rely so much on sentiment, but...damn, I loved this movie!  The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well.  It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course.  I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the \\"toy\\" breeds, although they can be cute).  It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).<br /><br />The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness.  Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog.  Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi.  And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station<br />(everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him.  Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie.<br />The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will.  Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and \\"cheap sentiment.\\"  (Funsuckers).  If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.<br /><br />The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized.  That's okay.  The story still hits home.  And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors!  The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's persepective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on.  I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work \\"The Cider House Rules,\\" \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\\" etc).  This is no exception.

1844137872|4.0|Well, I too say \\"every wall, a potential museum!\\" However, only with quality:  \\"Write or draw anything you want, just so it's better than the blank page or bare wall.\\"  (A criterion whitsch few today will value, respect...)  In these regard, I think that Bansky, is one who \\"has not lived in vein.\\"  (Like Garry Trudeau of Donesbury.  Like Deb Tannen of books on human communication. Heck, like the very best graffiti artists world wide.)    What animates him? What perhaps-immature pulsion? (Propulsion; compulsion?) But \\"sublimation\\" is useful (foundation of civilization said Freud). His wild stallion sublimmitated to a workhorse of social utility?  No matter, I'm just glad he did all this, and got it photographed also. An \\"indispensable small tessera in the big Mosaic of artistry\\" so to speek.    Is it social criticism, via satire? (Satire = the \\"mocking and ridiculing of human vices and follies.\\") But somebody said, for good satire you need high criteria, a worthy target, your own fiery outrage--but also a touch of like wit, whee, sprezzatura, elan, insuechiance, artistic tork, like that.  Otherwise it's mere \\"complaining.\\"  I buy that and with Bansky do you get both slam and also suave?  Seems-like.    Oh also, true \\"style,\\" as somebody else defined as \\"attainment and restraint.\\"  (Again, a standard whitsch few today will even comprehend...) Like it sure does Get There, but then stops short of excess.  True in morals, art¡ athletics!  Does Banksky's subtle tones of wry, achieve this, elevate his work from mere splat-in-public-face?  It can for me.  Car karkass painted zebra-striped. Kid dangelling from a McDonalds  balloon. Less mere dumb wham, than lite-touche whee.    His verbal explications do seem to reflect a facile rebelliousness, social criticism on steroids?  His verbal is less than his visual thus?  Maybe \\"just an excuse\\"? (Like when the big Gilbert & George retrospective came to the Milwaukee Public Museum, I was sardonically amused to hear the \\"docents\\" there stumbelling over them selves, trying to legitimize, justify, validate what I at least see as G. & G.'s facile self-pleasing experimental sneaky sensationalist careerism. (They mouth \\"art for all, liberation,\\" etc.--but then draw trendie skatologie and etc.) True, at least a dozen valid artistries from the 500 pages of their retrospective book. How much of Bansky will remane indispensable after all?    Well, what are your Bansky faves?  Oh my best is that slamming juxtaposition of Ronald McDonald, Mickie Mouse, but in the center, the nude crying girl running from the Mei Lie massacre.  Other items have the acerbic byte also.  But I do like the whimsie.  That zebra car-cass--gentle touche.  An ATM spewing out faik Princess Dy money, in a trump l'oeuil affect on the wall--a dance of sort's.  So many other stencils of people on the wall.  I can say:  \\"Yes, an attempt was made, this peopelizes the urban terrain so, why not.\\" Let other's do as well--in their own wais of koarse...    Some Banksy stuff is just suave.  \\"Designated riot area\\"--that's rye!  \\"Register before committing graffiti\\" on a subway car--that's an eye-wink! \\"Mind the crap\\" outside off a museum or pareil--thats a tork of the British \\"mind the step\\" meening \\"dont tripe on the stareway.\\"  And \\"Polite Line, Don¡¦t Get Cross\\"--thats less kornie nice-nice, than style-ish mockerie deservedly. In a painting of Monets, \\"lillie pond with bridge,\\" shopping karts lie a skew half-submerged--thats  the social criticism salved by the sauce of deft.  Oh, and the sharks fins apparently floating in an urban park pond.  Less intrusive via in-your-faice Social Crit or pareil, than just \\"wow look but then float easy I get it what is it.\\"  Also the traffik koans.  First, artfully-reformed ones and thats saying \\"art anywhere and why not\\"(think Japanese minimal garnishes in the quotidian diurnal mundane...) Then, a koan on top of hedd of statute in the park, like a dunces cap.  Again \\"Y knott.\\" No, art does not always have to be like Matisse famous paragraph \\"an easy chair for tired businessman at end of day\\" like. But I like \\"subversive whimsy\\" as my own cartoons show (70-p. book).  As in on a wall, stencil of a mouse-hole with two rats in tuxxeedoes gaitkeapers. And one says, \\"Well why not and cheers and whee and elan and have a happi day.\\"¨    Diskloasure. Near the end of this (gasp) librarys kopi of the book, I (1) inscribed a cartoon-face \\"my-style\\" reacting to his statement, and (2) shall insert in that (shudder) publically-owed property, a kopi of this review befoar returning it.  Oh how rong, immateur, and etc.  However autem pero par contre--such extra-vagant reciprokaiting seems like the meta- or mimetic- right thing to do. To cooperate-salute (not to co-opt) indeed saltate with, this versive artist?  He show's us that Yes We Kan can, and Right, Here-Now!

B002WY65UQ|3.0|Wow. If you thought the students of [[ASIN:B0000A02TZ N Animal House]] or [[ASIN:B00005JM1F Old School]] were out of control, think again. They've got nothing on the girls of [[ASIN:B002WY65UQ St. Trinian's]], who seem to delight in delinquency. The sheer outrageousness of their antics makes [[ASIN:B002WY65UQ St. Trinian's]] good for more than a few laughs. The girls are generally great actresses - they're the real stars of the movie. Especially the twins who make the chemical explosives - adorable yet dangerous is a great combination for comedy.    I should warn you that the humor isn't subtle. In fact, it's in your face and abrupt. Sometimes this is effective, but at points it didn't wear well. There were a few jokes that could have used a better buildup. For example, the bathroom scene, when Colin Firth overhears the girls chatting. It's obvious what's going to happen, but I thought the dialogue was a bit weak given the scene's potential. Some of the pranks were just plain scary, like nailing a girl to the chalkboard...    Also, Rupert Everett cross-dressing as a female didn't really do anything for me. I didn't him (or her?) particularly funny. It's one of those gags that might work for a minute, but gets pretty tiring quickly. I think the movie would have been better off with more on the girls, less on Everett and the adults.    Overall, a funny movie, definitely worth watching for a few laughs, but not a classic. Hopefully the sequel focuses more on the girls themselves and their antics.

006621131X|5.0|I really loved this book.  Smith's writing is simple and elegant, and the story of these two lovers and then friends is just beautiful.  She tells what happened without a bunch of name dropping or whining or gossiping, which could easily have been the case.  I'm sure there was a lot of BS swirling around he scene during these times and she filters it down to the essentials and it really held my interest.    I actually had never heard her albums, except maybe some snippets.  I happened to get \\"Horses\\" the day I finished the book.  I played it and it is completely awesome.  She rocks.  But her poetry and talking is the clencher.  Combination of singing and verse and she sings it from the gut.  Reading her book, you get a sense of her depth and intelligence but you gotta listen to her music because she is fantastic.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|This is the first CD to cover Michael Jackson's entire career from his early Jackson 5 years in the 70s to his later years in the mid 90s. Almost all his number one hits are here and famous songs such as ABC, Bad, Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean, and this CD offers a really great variety of songs. Although there were a few songs that I didn't care for on this CD, as well as songs that I wish they would have included like Earth Song or Never Say Goodbye, it overall has quality soundtracks and is remastered in high sound quality. A minor thing is that they cut some of the songs short from the originals, most likely do to the time limit on the CDs, but the meat and potatoes of all the songs are on this CD and aren't missing much of the original. If you are a die hard Jackson fan, you may want to buy each of his individual albulms, as this CD is missing a few essential songs from certain albulms, as well as cuts a few good songs shorter than the original counterpart, but if you are just a casual Jackson or pop fan, and are looking for a CD with almost all his top hits from the Jackson 5 years to the 90s, this CD is a must buy, and is really the only CD that spans his entire career. It is a lot cheaper than buying each albulm and is worth lossing a few songs over if you don't have the money to buy individual albulms or don't want to go through the trouble of figuring out which CDs to buy to get all his top songs. I think next Sony needs to release a DVD and Blu-ray of all Jackson's music videos, that would be the ultimate tribute to the late King of Pop.
B000FC2ROU|2.0|I had so much hope for this book, but it never really panned out. One can tell from the very beginning that Murakami is obviously a good writer, that's what held my interest to the end of the book. In anticipation of some great tie-in or genius event closures for all the weirdness, I was vastly disappointed in the lazy way he wrote Kafka's re-entry into his old life, and let the other characters just sort of drift off the page after nonessential drivel page after page. Too bad. Had heard such good things about him.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|After the brutal attack against his family, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) studied the law for ten years and then used it to his advantage. The flawed legal system messed with the wrong man! Clyde was a genius, very angry and out for revenge.<br />During that ten year period Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx)raised a daughter... no, his wife raised her because he was never around. Nick didn't spend much quality time with his family because he was busy pursuing a successul career. He was extremely motivated to be on top, to have a high conviction rate, to work his way from prosecuting attorney to D.A. that his own agenda was the only thing that really mattered to him. Mr. Rice had his priorities straight by the end of the movie. It was a shame that so much had to happen before he took a real good look at himself.<br />I sat through Law Abiding Citizen at the theater because my husband wanted to see it -I don't usually care for movies with strong bloody violence(Besides what happened in the beginning of the movie, Clyde Shelton performed some gruesome acts to get his point across and I mean really horrible, disgusting things). There were parts I didn't care to watch, and I didn't; I closed my eyes often. I gave it four stars because of Gerard Butler's superb performance and because the message is an important one: The justice system needs to value people more than conviction rates.
B000QUCNOU|5.0|Robert Graysmith is a cartoonist who works for the San Francisco Chronicle. His quirky ways irritate Paul Avery, a reporter whose drinking gets in the way of doing his job. The two become friends thanks to a shared interest: the Zodiac killer. Graysmith steadily becomes obsessed with the case, as Avery's life spirals into drunken oblivion. Graysmith's amateur sleuthing puts him onto the path of David Toschi, a police inspector who has thus far failed to catch his man; Sherwood Morrill, a handwriting expert; Linda del Buono, a convict who knew one of the Zodiac's victims; and others. Graysmith's job, his wife and his children all become unimportant next to the one thing that really matters: catching the Zodiac. \\"Zodiac\\" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's movie expecting a traditional serial killer thriller.  Early scenes in this movie are shocking and, compared to the rest of the movie, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. Parts of \\"Zodiac\\" are intensely creepy. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances.  I found it to be a great story told in a remarkable way, very entertaining, with great performances, and wonderful direction.

B000066AXE|5.0|At Princeton University, John Nash struggles to make a worthwhile contribution to serve as his legacy to the world of mathematics. He finally makes a revolutionary breakthrough that will eventually earn him the Nobel Prize. After graduate school he turns to teaching, becoming romantically involved with his student Alicia. Meanwhile the government asks his help with breaking Soviet codes, which soon gets him involved in a terrifying conspiracy plot. Nash grows more and more paranoid until a discovery that turns his entire world upside down. Now it is only with Alicia's help that he will be able to recover his mental strength and regain his status as the great mathematician we know him as today. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is absolutely great, not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humourous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. This movie succeeds on every level.

B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The narrator suffers from a lack of sleep. He tries different ways to cure this, but he does not succeed. He does get some sleep, but his conditions rebounds back into it's original state when he meets a lovely young woman, whose name is Marla. He finds out that she and he both have a lot in common and they spend a lot of time together. While touring, he meets an enigmatic young man named Tyler and after a short conversation both become fast friends. Both like to relieve their inner tensions by hitting each other. Soon word gets around about their fights, and lots of young people also get interested. Then a club is formed, which the narrator and Tyler call 'Fight Club'. Both start spending a lot of time and both also make lots of money. \\"Fight Club\\" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. What makes \\"Fight Club\\" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. A dangerously brilliant movie that entertains as well as enlightens, tt doesn't get much better than this.

B001M4YZ90|4.0|Lenny Cole, a London mob boss, puts the bite on all local real estate transactions. For substantial fees, he's helping Uri Omovich, a Russian developer. As a sign of good faith, Omovich loans Cole a valuable painting, promptly stolen off Cole's wall. While Cole's men, led by the dependable Archie, look for the canvas, three local petty criminals, the Wild Bunch, steal money from the Russian using inside information from his accountant, the lovely Stella. Meanwhile, a local drug-addled rocker, Johnny Quid, is reported drowned, and his connection to Cole is the key to unraveling the deceits and double crosses of life in the underworld. The cast is very good, Gerard Butler gives a good performance, Thandie Newton also very good, Tom Wilkinson flawless as always and the secondary roles from Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid), Idris Elba (Mumbles) and Mark Strong (Archie) gave the movie a very good support. \\"RocknRolla\\" is a entertaining movie you will enjoy and that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1439110123|5.0|Daniel Yergin's \\"The Prize\\" relates the modern history of oil and its implication on global political and economic issues.  Throughout this nearly 800-page effort, Yergin does a terrific job of presenting a detailed and comprehensive account that is informative and extremely entertaining.  Yergin describes the creation of the major oil companies and how their relationship with the governments of the oil-producing nations evolved from a tenant/landlord relationship into full blown partnerships.  Some of the things that I learned that surprised me were:<br /><br />1. The number of key political figures from the 20th and 21st century whose political careers had ties to oil.<br />2. Synthetic fuels have been discussed and produced since World War I.  However, the low cost of oil, relative to the creation and implementation of these synthetic fuels has made it cost-prohibitive to make it a true alternative to oil.<br />3. The role oil has played in nearly every military struggle since its discovery in the late 19th century.<br />4. How the low cost of oil over the last century is what has really has transformed the global economic state of affairs.<br /><br />This book is written from an objective perspective that is non partisan in any shape or form.  Yergin does such a great job presenting detailed information in such an entertaining and engaging manner that I rarely had to consult the index when key figures or corporations were re-introduced throughout the narrative.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking to learn more about the role oil has played within modern world history.
B00336C3EY|1.0|I am the Blood Simple, Fargo, No Country for Old Men kind of Coen brothers fan.  Not the Ladykillers, O'Brother or Barton Fink kind of fan.  That being said, this movie had a great look, but in my opinion not very compelling.  It was just there, with little bits of maybe this is going somewhere, but nope.  I think if you grew up in the Jewish culture you would have a much greater appreciation for this movie.

B00319KS7C|4.0|I went into this expecing quirky, from director Steven Soderbergh.  It is not suppose to be a typical white collar crime drama.  I loved the voice over with the main character just giving random thoughts, even in the most ridiculous context of what was happening to him at the time.  It is not an action packed, drama filled movie, but it is a pleasant black comedy with Matt Damon giving a realy understated performance.  Not laugh out loud funny but certainly brings you into the period of the early 1990's and tells the true story of a guy who was living in another world in his head.
B001CQONKY|3.0|While I've never watched a single broadcast episode of CSI, I've purchased every season set of this core series. Now, the reason I've been purchasing the season sets was because of my initial purchase of the Bones season sets and so I had decided to jump into another crime drama. CSI happened to be that very bet.    Now, I've enjoyed the series up until now but I had found this season to be particular dull and it seemed to lack the friendly atmosphere that I had enjoyed from the previous seven seasons. The mix-up of the cast threw me off-balance and it seemed that the characters were bumping around aimlessly with no real purpose. However, overall, the series is still rather enjoyable to watch.    The one good thing that fans of this show can expect is that the two-art crossover episode that begins in Episode 806 and concludes in \\"Without a Trace Episode 3T6108 - Where and Why\\" are both included in this set so there's no reason to buy Without a Trace Season 3.

B002SJIO5E|1.0|It was no fun watching this movie, either. The makers of this film have limited knowledge of human motives, emotions, and organization. To say that the display of human reaction to the arrival of an interstellar spacecraft was indifferent is an understatement.  Every human in the movie treats the presence of aliens on earth as a nuisance and a burden. There is no fear, no awe, no desire to learn their story, and other than the typical evil government/corporate cliche trying to copy their weapons, there is no wonder at the advanced alien technology of which there is an ever-present reminder hanging in the South African sky (I would have said Johannesburg sky, but the spacecraft is so huge it must be visible for hundreds of miles). Even more remiss is the lack of a single scene where a human ponders the fate of humanity, now that beings from another planet have arrived. In fact the disregard for safety is so pronounced that humans board their ship without fear of contamination and then decide that these physically dangerous and technologically advanced creatures from another world should stay as our guests. In later scenes we see that alien artifacts, including weapons, are everywhere amongst the aliens and humans who share the shantytowns together. In reality the governments of the world would have removed any human presence under the spacecraft, put a lockdown on access to the ship, and would study it and its contents forever. The end. Any variation on that story would come from the discoveries made and/or the actions of the aliens. The filmmakers could have contrived an interesting plot from that scenario, but instead we get a ridiculous parable about immigration policy.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Where can i begin with this worthless piece of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies ever, and it never ends. Literally it is 3 hours and 13 minutes long. It might be scary if you are younger than 9 years old, otherwise its not scary at all. Also the clown can not for some reason kill an adult. There are so many instances throughout the movie where the clown doesn't even hurt anyone. It truly is a piece of crap. If you are bold enough to watch this movie, then may god have mercy on your soul.   ps: they float like a giant terd!
B002B4OVWG|3.0|THe seller was great the monkey was shipped fast! But, my daughter is 3 months old so obviously cant do much wear and tear on anything yet. And the monkey's ear was coming off, the thread unraveled after about a month. Not cool, especially because with shippping it cost me $19 to get this for her. i expected it to last much longer!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Love all her music since the early years. She has real talent that seems to be lacking in newer artist these days.
B001AII4TA|5.0|I bought this so my grandchildren and I could watch it together.  My grandaughter loved it and I was entertained beyond omy expectations.  I now have both Madagascar movies in BluRay.  Great fun for the kids.  Highly recommend
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|I recently bought An Ancient Muse.  I do enjoy this CD and there are some songs me and my daughter particularly like.  I would recommend buying An Ancient Muse to add to your CD collection of Lorena McKennett.  It is not the same as the other CD (the book of secrets)I have. I think that it has it's own special sound that is very enjoyable and unique.  I love Lorena Mckennetts music and I think she has produced a very enjoyable CD.

044654146X|5.0|What makes Israel a country with just over 7 million population, limited resources and surrounded by challenges, achieve such feats in economic prosperity?      On the other hand, countries like India and China with over 1 billion population pale in comparison.      You'll be amazed how seemingly simple facts can be profound.      I am not much of a reader.  But I found it hard to put down this book.  While the subject of economics generally does not catch people's interest, the book makes it very interesting like a story, with facts and figures.      If you were mostly up-to-date with the news in the past, you will be able to recollect a lot of news/events that occurred in the past and associate them with the untold stories & incidents from behind the scene.  Akin to watching the 'making of the movie' after watching the movie itself.      Today when the US is going through tough economic times, there is a lot that can be learned from this book.  The very model of entrepreneurship that built the US has been perfected by this tiny nation.  Perhaps US could take a cue or two from Israel's success story in resuscitating it's economy.     A very simple/lucid but profoundly inspiring and thought provoking book.  One can read it over and over ... plenty to learn from it.
0307473708|5.0|The book was in excellent condition and it arrived promptly. The book itself was amazingly intense. I greatly enjoyed it! I'm a big fan of the Dexter books and television series!
0446567337|5.0|This was for my 16 year old granddaughter. She said it is a very good book
0307408833|5.0|This is the only cookbook I have ever purchased and used for more then a week.  If you take the time to read the intro and the directions and follow closely you will end up with some amazing baked goods that are actually kind of good for you.  Not only does the food taste unreal but it does not leave you with that greasy, gross, sugary stomachache that most sweets do.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B001HN6940|4.0|When it comes to Tim Burton, he really LOVES to make us wait for his next movie. No surprise, it's been like that ever since he released 2 movies in the same year in 2005 (Charlie and Corpse Bride). And when I heard he was creating his own vision of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited. I certainly couldn't wait, it sounded like it was going to be an excellent movie. However, of course, I got pissed when back in MAY 08, I find out that it would be released in 10 months. So I waited patiently, and when I saw it last night, I wasn't disappointing.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland currently has a polarized audience reaction going on right now. Either you love it, or you hate it. I was well aware of this when I went to go see it. So that said, I stripped myself of all expectations, left them at the theater door, and just went in ready to take in what the movie was about to give me. And you know what? I wasn't disappointed. Was it Shakespeare-level? No. Was it exactly great? Maybe not, but I REALLY liked it, I have almost nothing (except for a couple boring spots and the ending) to complain about. Therefore, it was enjoyable for me.<br /><br />13 years after the events that Alice experienced, Alice is 19, and lives with her family. She is being pressured upon to accept an engagement from a man she doesn't like. So at the engagement party, after seeing the rabbit show her that she is very late for her important date, she runs to where the rabbit hole is and falls down it one more time. After struggles to shrink herself, she meets up with everyone she knows once again and is taken to The Mad Hatter, who reveals to her that The Red Queen is terrorizing wonderland once again. She must help The Mad Hatter and the white queen stop the Red Queen from eventually overtaking Wonderland before it's too late.<br /><br />So in total, that isn't exactly the best plot for a sequel, is it? Well, I didn't think it was, but that didn't prevent me from really loving the movie. The visuals are very gorgeous like we see in the trailer. The CG is well rendered, and in short it looks gorgeous. As for performances, Alice was portrayed very well by Mia Wasikowska. She really did a great job, she really nailed the role big time. Bonham Carter was great as The Red Queen too- she really has come a long way as her role as the junkie Marla in Fight Club. Of course, Depp never fails to entertain, and Alice in Wonderland is proof- his wacky performance as The Mad Hatter is certainly enough to keep your attention. The only performance that wasn't exactly great was Crispin Glover as Knave of Hearts- that may be in part due to his character, but he wasn't bad in the movie, he did quite good. Just he wasn't one of the better performances.<br /><br />I do have but two complaints- I thought the ending seemed really fanfic-ish, and the movie was slow in a few spots. And also, one more thing- if you're going to see it in 3D, it is really good. I definitely recommend it, as it is well used. That said, I really liked the movie and I can't really see why people are complaining. I guess people need SOMETHING to complain about. So guys, don't be a puppet of the critics, and DON'T let your expectations run away with you. See the movie and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Oh, and someone please tell me where I can learn some of the hatter's funky dance moves.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br />Entertainment: 8/10<br />Violence: 4/10- quite a bit in this movie<br />Depp: Mad as a Hatter indeed<br />Gorgeous visuals: A visual feast<br />Burton: May be getting unoriginal, but not declining in terms of directing<br /><br />***Recommended***ke we see in the trailer.

193413712X|3.0|This is Harding's first book, and it shows. As other reviewers have noted, the time, plot, and characters jump around a lot. Now, I don't have a problem with that in the abstract, but it must be done very skillfully for it to work. I don't think it works here. That, plus Harding's idiosyncratic writing style (no quotation marks, very stream-of-consciousness), leaves me with the feeling he's trying too hard to make the book sound like great literature, while the writing style tries to mask a subpar narrative.     I hated the first half, and it did get better in the second half as we learned more about the main character's early childhood. But it was too little, too late for me, and I just didn't think this book worked.
B0038P2AZW|3.0|my title says it all..........I liked the premise. Good story line with some promising subplots..hated hated hated the editing sytle of 4 frames of the monsters and back to the actors BS. JUST ABSOLUTELY WANTED TO PUT MY FOOT RIGHT UP THE EDITORS BACKSIDE. And smack the back of the head of the exec producer too.  You had the hard part of this project done - a script that works - and actors who can do some acting - couldnt you guys just try a tiny weeny bit more and not rush the third act so fast you killed all story lines and subplots (likely in a single evening) ?<br /><br />must be one of those shot and posted in the eastern block productions...........did I mention I absolutely freaking HATED the 4 frames shots of the \\"monsters\\"..........<br /><br />starts out 4 stars, then left turns into 2 star land........hence 3 stars.....
8862931921|5.0|The classic Moleskine design and aesthetics have always appealed to me. The lay-flay binding, the integral bookmark, the elastic closure and the pocket in the rear all make Moleskine's extremely useful and versatile. But where Moleskine's have fallen flat in recent years is paper quality, which has been spotty at best; at worst, gel and fountain pen users have found the paper to be terrible, with bleeding and feathering major problems. I'm among the fountain pen crowd, and because of Moleskine's paper issues have had to look elsewhere.    I'm happy to say that this particular Moleskine has no paper quality issues. The paper is an off-white, smooth, 90gsm product that just loves fountain pens. Bleeding is non-existent and show-through is very minimal. I can finally write on both sides of the paper with my wettest pens. The difference in paper quality between this journal and the standard Moleskine sizes is like night and day.    If you've had problems with Moleskine paper in the past and don't mind the larger size, you are definitely going to love writing on this paper. It has become my journal of choice.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This is the first new book I have read for several years - terrible I know, but it really has shown me what I have been missing out on. This is a great story, written in in a very straightforward style, I find all to often the writing style gets in the way of a great story, this is spot on. I had to read this book every spare minute I could find, and I have a feeling the remaining millennium books will be just the same (I hope so!)
B00275EGWY|1.0|What an absolute piece of C--P!    The worst war movie I have ever seen, and I have seen them ALL.    The dialogue is lame, everything is lame about this movie.    Now I know why the true (awesome) veterans of the Iraq War think this movie S-cks!     Avatar, despite the tree hugging BS, is lightyears ahead of this stinking tripe.    Yet it is almost certain to sweep the Oscars, because Hollywood is That Far Away from reality now...    Very Sad Stuff.    The Searcher
B001PA0FFO|3.0|Interesting viewing but was not all I expected from a Meryl Streep film. It seems to be slightly over rated.
B0030B0S2Q|4.0|I really just wanted to put up the stars and leave it at that.......but ok fine..........its a good movie......if you read the story line and though it might be something you like, I will tell you  - correct! it will be something you will like; it will not disappoint.  Now if you need to see action action action, I'm assuming you can tell from the storyline that this isnt for you. if you didnt figure that out yet, Let me tell you. This isnt for you.<br /><br />now I'm done.......
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Simply Put, one of the worst movies ever made...worse than Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.<br /><br />My only problem is...how do I get my money back from Best Buy without lying...I guess I'm out of pocket $16.99 plus tax and reamed, steamed and dry cleaned by Roland Emmerich again; but never again, I'll see to that.<br /><br />The funny thing is...I'll probably watch it again just to see how bad it really was the first time I witnessed this calamity and to think that there are people dyin' in the streets and we spend money on such tripe and I hope the Cow's brain doesn't take it personally being compared to this POS and I could go on but won't waste anymore of your time or mine, so...<br /><br />Peace Out,<br /><br />Warren

1439102813|4.0|This book was written with enough suspense to keep me turning the pages and really gave me insight into the disease process with Alzheimer's.  Both my parents died with dementia, and this was the best description of the downward slope that I have read.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|James Horner created another masterpiece with this soundtrack. It may sound reminiscent of other popular Hollywood soundtracks at times but it corresponds to the movie perfectly and that is what makes a movie soundtrack great. Too bad this one doesn't have the bonus 15th track \\"Into the Na'Vi world\\" but it still deserves 5 stars to me. Wonderful music!
B000002LAC|5.0|This Cd is an excellent combination of these three artists, who, individually are stars in their own right but when together the blends of their voices is magical.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I've been a fan of MJ's from the beginning.  I was heartbroken at his passing.  Kenny Ortega's brillant film brought me to tears in the theater.  the DVD did the same.  It was noted that MJ said   \\"At 50 I'm young enough to do This is It and my children are old  enough to see it.\\"  There is no greater tribute for his children and his fans.
1594481717|5.0|In his book, A Whole New Mind, Daniel Pink shines a light on the bleak reality facing knowledge workers in the 21st century.  Pink opens by explaining the forces causing knowledge workers in the West to compete, and loose, with workers in emerging economies as repetitive tasks are automated or exported to low-cost centers. Throughout the rest of the book, Pink presents six skills (senses he calls them) which he claims will enable the knowledge workers in the developed world to maintain a home-field advantage based on creativity and innovation.    The key senses Pink identifies are Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning.  Pink explains by developing one's brain to build strength in these areas, more value can be discovered in traditional right-brain focused endeavors.  Pink presents how he was able to gain and self-discover in these areas and provides references to outside sources.  He has chosen to do this is in a rather unique way.  First, he presents an argument for the particular sense.  This is usually backed-up with research and an interview with an expert in the field.  Pink relays his own personal experiences were applicable.  Pink's own stories range from taking a drawing class to walking labyrinths to joining a laughter group.  After justifying the key senses, Pink presents a section called Portfolio where resources and concrete, take-away advice are provided for the reader.    While some people might be put off by the subtitle Why Right-Brainers will Rule the Future, potential readers must understand that Pink is not excluding left-directed, logical/linear thinkers from leading prosperous lives in the future.  In fact, Pink spends most of the book's pages presenting techniques to unlock a whole-brained thought method.  This ties back into main title of the book.  Pink is really presenting ideas to move the user away from the left-directed thinking taught in most schools towards using both hemispheres equally.    Where the book does fall shortis that it fails to adequately address that whole-brained thinking is not proprietary to a Western Culture attempting to keep jobs on-shore.  I feel strongly that design-thinking and good designs must come within the culture its creations are to serve.  Indian car designers will not be successful selling one of their designs in North America or Europe.  Likewise, car designers sitting in Detroit will miss the nuances of the Indian automobile market and also fail to deliver a compelling product.  I use this as an example because it shows that whole-brained, design thinking is regional and not proprietary to the West.  If someone was going to read this book and believe that whole-brained thinking would save them in the world economy, I am afraid they would be disappointed.  What reading this book is will accomplish is making that knowledge worker more relevant within their own market.  This might not seem like a lot, but there are always positions which must remain close to the market and close to the customer.  Those positions are difficult to replicate in a low-cost center.    This book should be on the short list of must-reads for aspiring engineers and product developers.  If anything, it adds to the knowledge worker's toolkit and gives a junior engineer something to aspire towards in how they approach innovation and creativity.  In a time of relatively bleak job security outlooks in a Friedman-esque flat world, Pink's book allows the reader to realize that what goes on between their ears is within their control.  Creative skills can be learned and enhanced, even in the most right-directed brain.  A Whole New Mind is not a perfect solution, but it gives the reader a jumping-off point for further self-discovery in support of a career focused on innovation.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I am in love with this show and all its characters and the story line is fantastic! I only wish I had stumbled across it sooner than I had. I hope there is a season 3! if you get the chance to watch this show please to i promise you wont be disappointed!!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I am in awe of the talent this album practically screams~ the voice is heavenly, the words have depth, the drums are entrancing, and there is versatility to the tracks-- great example is \\"Kiss with a Fist\\", such a fun song that should be the anthem of any survivor of abuse.  You can see the passion of Florence in her music vid for \\"Drumming Song\\"... the look on her face and how she throws herself into dance.  If I could give more stars I would.
