B000002LHX|5.0|It's good to know that some artist are willing to do music for movies & Make a whole albume to that movie. Thats why i think that \\"BatMan\\" is great. the movie was awesome too. The best songs on this cd are, Trust, electric chair, the future & Batdance. If you liked this one you'll like the others too, Batman Returns, By Danny Elfman, Batman forever, & Batman & Robin.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life sold over two hundred thousand in its first week of release. Reviews were disastrous. This album is actually one of Madonna's best POP ALBUM. Songs like American Life,Die Another Day, Nothing Fails, Hollywood, Love Profusion,X-Static Process almost defines the unknown edges of pop music. Why were those critics so pretentious and always judge popular music with so much arty farty point of views? I'm not exactly a fan of Madonna and I have only just bought this album recently; seems like ten years after its release (because I had read the awful reviews); but it is a great pop album to keep and its not a bit dated.
0312958455|5.0|Another wonderful book by Connelly.  This one goes straight for Harry's heart.  Everything in his life broken (yes, even more broken than usual) and he goes straight into what he calls in Concrete Blonde the \\"dark heart.\\"  Harry finally begins to solve the murder of his mother (again, I could not help but think of James Ellroy's real life struggles) and his own guilt.  Some of the twists here are indeed shocking--Pounds for example, but again Irving surpises and we meet some new stars--Russell, Jazz, and even a decent IAD cop.  When the story threatens to go off the tracks, connelly brings it back and adds a final surprise just at the end.  This guy is SO good.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|First of all i am a RadioHead Fan (mostly Bends-ok Computer era), and music fan in general. When i first heard Muse i inmediatly tought it sounded like RadioHead, only because of Matt's voice, but when you listen closely you start to realize this band is something more than just a mere comparison to many known bands (Nirvana,Queen, etc). Muse is in a league of its own, musicianship at its best ( one of my other favorites bands is Dream Theater for this kind of prodigy), every instrument its top notch and well complemented with the vocals. Sadly Muse is not a band for everyone, not for todays pop-music, fabricated-boring crap generation. If you like good instruments, excellent vocals and dark lyrics, you'll love Muse. <br />If they keep this up in another album or better yet improved it i think Muse will know longer be unknown to the mass media, and they'll have the recognition they deserved, i just hope they don't lose their vision only to sell albums in America. <br />
0765301598|3.0|Honestly,the Butlerian Jihad Prequels are hit and miss to a large degree.The overall story is engaging and entertaining but not presented well,in my opinion.As the reviewer below mentions,the characters are all pretty one-dimensional and hard to get inside of.The novels seem to read more like a history than an actual storyline.Kind of like watching Gettysburg as a stage play instead of a film.But then again perhaps that was the intent.It does have a sweeping span to it,but it is more akin to short chapter-like Star Wars episodes than the original Dune novels. <br />  And to respond to some of the loose ends that another reviewer mentioned...As most of you probably know,Anderson and Herbert also intend to finish the Dune Chronicals with two more novels that take place after Chapterhouse:Dune.These novels are going to come directly from Frank Herbert's outlines before his untimely death.In Chapterhouse,it was implied that the Honored Matres and others were coming back to the empire because they were fleeing another power.It was never explained what they were running from.It would make sense that according to the  Butlerian Prequels,since Omnius sent out the copy/probes of itself and \\"uploaded\\" himself into deep space,that the Thinking Machines may be returning to Imperium space after 14,000 years.This is also implied by a sequence in the novel House Corrino where a Guild heighliner accidently jumps out of known space and the navigator senses an intense hatred of humanity in that unknown area.That could be consistant with the Machines still being in existance.Since aliens or other intelligences have never been in the Dune dogma,this fits as well.  <br />  So I think the loose ends will end up playing a part in the Dune finale novels.As to the fate of certain characters,it's rather refreshing to leave the story a little open ended as far as the Atreides and Harkonnen dynasties.Perhaps for the readers imagination or future novels/short stories. <br />  As far as beingdisappointed with the novels,I'm not.They are entertaining (if not somewhat predictable) and good reading material if you love the Dune saga.Are they on par with Frank Herbert's epic novels?No..unfortunately not.But these are different authors with their own styles and storytelling methods.One can't forget that.But I think the saga is still in good hands..who better to continue than his son?...and I'll still look forward to the next installment....
B00005JN7O|5.0|I finally was able to attend an advance screening of this film and I couldn't disagree with one of the previous reviewers more.  I was expecting so much, and was still blown away with the look, story, action, romance, and humor.  It's actually one of the funnier movies I've seen in a long time.  I think people will not like Paltrow as much as the other actors, but that's because she plays her character so well. She's suppose to be abrasive, but at the same time you understand their attraction to one another.  I know the exact girl I'm going to ask to see this movie with and I can't wait for September 17th to see it with her. Jude Law is Sky Captain.  He's now up there with Harrison Ford in my book.
B00029LNHS|5.0|The BEP had been in my radar since their song \\"Request Line\\".  After seeing them live, I became a true fan and bought their album \\"Elephunk\\", its a gem.  My favorites are the songs \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Let's get retarded\\", \\"Hey Mama\\", and of course \\"Where is the love\\".  This is truly a great album, and a way over due hit for the Black Eyed Peas.
B000268QB2|2.0|Yeah, they've got piano.  Tons of it.   In fact, save for some bleeps, bass and a few other sounds courtesy of their iBook, that's basically all Keane has to offer in the way of melodic instrumentation.  Does this mean they sound like Coldplay? Maybe. Whether or not they sound like Coldplay or whoever else the critics seem to be mentioning isn't important, as you folks can listen for yourselves.       What it DOES mean is that a lot of the songs sound similar to each other...so if you dig one track, you're in luck (and, if you like the whole \\"British people doing reverb-y whale song imitations\\" genre, this basically means you).   If you don't, you're in for a sappy, samey and ultimately inconsequential ride.       This album isn't \\"Good Charlotte, Suicide-Inducing\\" bad.  It's merely \\"Hear It Once In Someone's Car or On Some Mall PA and Forget It Immediately\\" bad.   That is, except for the single, entitled \\"Everybody's Changing\\".  Sure, full band instrumentation might have vastly improved it, but you just can't screw up a good, creepy, four-on-the-floor New Wave lament.  Skip the album, download the single, and entertain the notion that Keane might someday ditch the wishy-washiness and lead the revival of that lost, unsettling, ethereal and inherently paradoxical genre known as soft rock.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna has been an Icon for twenty years now.  \\"Music\\", her release from 2000 has some great material on it.  Of course, the title track is blazing and went straight to number 1.  \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is also another great track, as is the often overlooked \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\".  If you don't own it, buy it!
B0000524CY|5.0|I never saw The Exorcist when it first came out years ago, but heard it was scary as hell, to boot.  When I finally saw it with a friend...it was scary as hell!!  Linda Blair was amazing as the young girl who was possed.  Especially the spider walk, was especially creepy, but well done.  Hats off for a spooky movie well done.
B000001G89|5.0|Even people who aren't opera fans recognize the beautiful music of \\"Carmen\\" and appreciate its beauty. Every fan of Bizet's masterpiece will adore this wonderful CD. The music gives its own raves.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This is an incredible movie.  Very, very good.  It was kept locked up for many years because of the disturbing visuals.  The structure, or society, of the traditional Freak show at the old traveling carnivals is accurately portrayed and the script is an excellent exploration of how the Freaks would treat an outsider they had trusted and accepted, who then betrayed them.  However, this movie is very difficult to watch.  Browning used real freaks - not make up- some of whom, like the pin heads, do not even exist today because of medical advances.  I found the movie to be well worth it and rated it at four stars, rather than five, only because I believe that most people would find it takes an effort to watch and not turn away.  This is definitely not for children!  The ending is incredible.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is the album that put megadeth \\"on the map\\", so to speak.  They made some great videos (Wake up dead, Peace sells) and signed with Capitol Records.  This is also the final album with the \\"Mustaine/Ellefson/Samuelson/Poland\\" lineup. <br /> <br />Wake up dead: 10/10 <br />My favorite song on the album.  It includes some great guitar riffs and solos, and just has a cool mood overall.   <br /> <br />The Conjuring: 9/10 <br />Again, great guitar work from Mustaine and Poland.  Not as good as the songs it falls between though.   <br /> <br />Peace sells: 10/10 <br />This is one of Megadeths biggest songs.  the opening bass riff is just a classic, and it was played on the MTV music news segments for years.  The lyrics to this one are great, too. <br /> <br />Devil's Island: 10/10  <br />An awesome song, with a catchy chorus.  It also has a cool guitar solo.  One of the best on the record. <br /> <br />Good Mourning: 5/5 <br />This is the softer, somewhat acoustic intro to the next song, which is... <br /> <br />Black Friday: 4/5 <br />After the slow Good Mourning half, the song kicks into high gear and turns into a very thrashy number.   <br /> <br />Bad Omen:  9/10 <br />Starts out with another slower paced intro, then it turns into an almost funk-thrash song.  Very interesting. <br /> <br />I ain't superstious:  10/10 <br />This one is a blues cover.  Dave made some lyrical changes to this one, and gave it a more thrash feel.  One of my favorites on the album.   <br /> <br />My Last Words:  10/10 <br />Starts off with yet another acoustic intro, then it turns into another fast-paced metal classic.  A great way to end the album. <br /> <br />Total: 77/80, 5 stars <br /> <br />BONUS TRACKS: <br />The bonus tracks are just different mixesof Wake up dead, Conjuring, Peace sells, and Good Mourning/Black Friday.  They are much more raw and include more reverb and looser sounding drums.  I would have rather seen demos, but this is better than nothing! <br /> <br />This version is the Newly Remixed/Remastered version, personally remixed by Dave Mustaine.  It sounds, obviously, much better than the original, and it includes new artwork and liner notes from dave himself.  Be sure to pick this up, even if you have the original!   <br />
B00004T9VY|5.0|Most people my age (15-20) dont even know who cat stevens is. I bought this CD after first hearing &amp;quot;Wild World&amp;quot;. Over time i came to love the entire CD. The lyrics are awesome and can be used for any occasion. People any age can enjoy and appreciate this CD.
6305971099|2.0|There are only two things I like about this movie. One is Donald Pleasence as Doctor Sam Looomis. He's become like Captain Ahab in that he's still wants to catch that elusive white whale. Or in this case, a white masked killer whom has consumed his life. The other thing are the two cops who act as a kinda comic relief. Pity they bite the dust. Other than that, this movie is hardly worth the effort. Especially the little plot hole of having a different house for the Michael's old home from the first two movies.
B00024BHTC|1.0|NIGHTWISH ARE JUST A TOTAL RIP OFF OF EARLY DREAM THEATRE AND SYMPHONY X WHO WERE A HELL OF A LOT MORE TECHNICAL AND HEAVIER THAN THIS.  THE HEAVY GUITAR RIFFS HAVE ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE AND THE STUPID OPERATIC BACKGROUND SOUNDS ARE EMBARRASSING TO LISTEN TO.  I RECKON SOME OF THESE '5' STAR REVIEWERS HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE BAND THEN WHAT THEY ARE LETTING ON, CAUSE I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED SO MANY ALLEDGED REVIEWERS ATTEMPT TO SUCKER PEOPLE INTO BUYING THIS !!!  CHECK OUT DREAM THEATRE'S EARLY MATERIAL AND SYMPHONY X, THE GUITARISTS CAN PLAY DECENT SOLOS FOR STARTERS.  I'VE LISTENED TO EVERY TRACK OF NIGHTWISH THROUGH MP3S AND THEY ARE ALL CRAP!!!  SO BUY AT YOUR PERIL  !!!
B00013RC9I|4.0|Once in a while, you'll come across a certain special album, and the one word that best describes it is \\"pretty.\\"  That's certainly an appropriate adjective for Air's \\"Talkie Walkie,\\" which has some breathtakingly elegant moments. The French duo creates dreamy landscapes of mellow pop with acoustic and electronic touches.  \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" soars kite-high with a catchy chorus and strong melody, while the dark and mysterious \\"Run\\" has interesting horror-show synths and hypnotic spoken vocals. The latter song could very well be my favorite on the album.  \\"Mike Mills\\" and \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\" are just as good and noteworthy.  To peg \\"Talkie Walkie\\" as mere chillout fare would do both this album and Air injustice.  It's strong enough to be considered one of the best albums I've heard this year.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Paul Greengrass' \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" may be a lightweight summer movie, but while you're watching it it will keep you on the edge of your seat. This sequel to \\"The Bourne Identity\\" has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) out to clear his name and save his own life after being framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Racing across India, Berlin and Moscow, Bourne does battle with a murderous assassin (Karl Urban, unrecognizable from his turn as the noble warrior Eomer in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") and two squabbling CIA division chiefs (Joan Allen, Brian Cox). There are car chases, shootings and stunts galore, and Greengrass doesn't miss a trick in keeping the film moving at breakneck speed. Damon, all traces of his \\"Good Will Hunting\\" baby fat gone, is a thoroughly believable action hero, and the rest of the cast--particularly Allen and Cox--is quite fine. Like a ride on a particularly slick rollercoaster, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is a fine way to pass the time on a lazy summer day.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I saw Tod Browning's other \\"classic,\\" Dracula, and it was weak, boring and not scary at all.  On the other hand, \\"Freaks,\\" a movie that could never be made today, yet hasn't aged at all in 70 years (except that the strong man is downright puny by today's standards), is powerful, moody and constantly entertaining.  Betrayal, revenge, loyalty, love, and some really trippy freaks.  What could be better?  Ok, the sound quality could be better, but that's about all.  And too bad the alternate endings have been lost.  \\"One of us\\" the freaks say to the lovely but evil trapeze artist, but she's not one of them--she doesn't deserve to be!  Definitely one of the all-time greats.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Some reviews to this compilation make you smile, only in America people will make a review of an album base on the sexuality of one of the members...grow up, you have such a close mind, don't like the music don't buy it but make a review of the album not on other things...Now to the review, if you want to start to listening queen then start here this is the truth compilation of queen with all the hits of there entire career. Disc one have all the hits of the 70's, of course is missing songs like tie your mother down ,stone cold crazy, brighton rock or the prophet song and keep your self alive but this aren't hits so there is no point to put them here if this is a greatest hits collection . Disc two have all the hits of the 80's and this is really a remarkable cd, such great songs like innuendo my all time favorite queen track , I want it all ...fantastic. Ok in America the only hits where under pressure, radio gaga and body language that is not in here, but these songs where true hits all over Europe, Japan and South America so there is no point if you say this are not hits. These songs prove why Queen where the band of the 80's. Disc 3 is all the hits that don't make the other albums `cause they have to many to put only in 2 discs,do you believe?   Ok there are 2 songs that are simply new collaboration the show must go on from 97 and the new mix of under pressure and the fantastic songs from Made in Heaven witch where hits all over Europe, Japan and South America like the solo songs all Hits. So there you have it why this is a greatest hits collection and not a best of , if you start somewhere start here this is the true place to begging listening Queen music then go and buy there albums you won't regret.  Good music makes always people fell better so that's what will happened to you.  Fight For Your Mind and don't let other people choose for you, if you like just have to say it.
0140042520|5.0|Kerouac's \\"Dharma Bums\\" extends his recurring theme of one man's quest to find true freedom of mind and soul.  Equally colorful characters are scattered throughout, just as in \\"On the Road.\\"  I suspect that every reader of Kerouac comes away from the experience with a slightly different outlook on life.  In my opinion, very few books ever accomplish this feat and Kerouac seems to do it with each and every work.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Funny, funny film from the people who brought you \\"Airplane!\\" and \\"The Naked Gun\\".  Almost as funny as the film is the commentary track by the creators -- apparently they aren't very fond of this one, and spend a good deal of time during the commentary mocking their own film.  But anyway, it's a very funny film.  My favorite part: Nick activating the Polaris Mine in the prison lab (check out the submarine guy!).  Also recommended (besides \\"Airplane!\\" and \\"The Naked Gun\\" of course): \\"The Kentucky Fried Movie\\", also by Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker.
B0002IU988|5.0|...that's right. Now the passion is there...read it in the lyrics, and listen to it in the range of Myles' voice. The undying love of music is there...hear it in the solos blaring out at the mercy of Tremonti's fingertips. The skills and the \\"want-to\\" are there...feel it in your stomach through the rhythmic beat of Flip's drums, and while Marshall's base lines creep up your body slowly from toe to head. The dream has become a reality for these guys, and it's obvious to the world by this CD...this is only my opinion, but I beg of you to listen for yourself...and prove me wrong.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay probably wouldn't thank me for pointing this out, but they do represent a triumph of the underdog. They suffered media disparagement based less on their musical abilities than on their characters. And they've come out on top with \\"A Rush...\\".  <br />The album opens with 'Politik''s clanging guitars, offering precisely the potency most observers thought was beyond them. They now sound not just like an award-winning multi-platinum band, but an award-winning multi-platinum band with a point to prove. Their new assurance is everywhere. Chris Martin's gorgeous performance transforms 'The Scientist' from the kind of piano ballad that ineffectually padded out their debut into a showstopping anthem, delicate and powerful in equal measure. 'Clocks' deelivers a sieved-up U2-Big Rock sound, without ever losing sight of the back of the stadium. When Coldplay began their recent Glastonbury performance with 'Politik', the audience roared as if the band were playing their biggest hit. That same bizarre sense of instant familiarity is all over \\"A Rush....: you feel you already know and like these songs the first time you hear them. The last band to pull off this remarkable feat was Oasis. But you immediately knew and liked their songs because they had pinched them: let's not get into the Beatles-recycling debate. With Coldplay, it is all down to beautifully crafted songwriting and an all-pervading aura of warm inclusiveness. The listener is drawn straight in by the well-worn eastern guitar motifs of 'Warning Sign': my favourite on this album; or the simple melody of 'In My Place'.  <br />However, that sort of immediacy comes at a price. There is no mystery here. It is finely wrought and brilliantly realised, but devoid of charming idiosyncrasy. It is comfortable rather than challenging, varied without being devastatingly original.  <br />It does, however, offer one of the most beguiling sounds in rock: that of a band at the top of their game.
0062502182|5.0|Who ever you might be and whatever you were meant to be in life, Santiago will somehow lead your life to a new dimension. Coelho in this marvelous little novel demonstrates what it means to bring your dreams to reality, what it means to have a dream. This book is about the \\"drops of oil\\" we guard at all times against all odds and irrespective of what might pass by us that might as well be far more important than what we already have. The book simply casts a spell on you that will surley keeps you wondering for days and days about the reason you're unhappy and about your unfulfilled dreams. I can't think of a book of its size with such a magnitude of meanings. It is a must for every human being and no doubt comes second to holy scriptures. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed it.
B0002IU988|5.0|One Day Remains, is the debut CD of Alter Bridge, is an interesting mix of good old fashioned, down to earth rockin and positive, searing lyrics.  <br /> <br />     This marriage of music and words makes an album that you can truly bang your head to...and feel great doing it! <br /> <br />     The single 'Open Your Eyes' introduced this wonderful new band but there are many, many other songs on this CD that can- *and will*- be just as popular! <br /> <br />     The CD blasts open with \\"FIND THE REAL\\", Goes through the uplifting \\"OPEN YOUR EYES\\", turns the corner at the frenzied \\"METALINGUS\\" , shares haunting grief with us on \\"IN LOVING MEMORY\\" and wraps the CD up like a perfect present with \\"THE END IS HERE\\".  <br /> <br />     The opening guitar tells us that this is NOT going to be any dull musical journey -- Alter Bridge is going to take you for one *HELL* of a ride!  They deliver it!  Five stars!!! <br /> <br />
B000024D4R|5.0|This album right here shows a little more 'rocking out' by Pinky.   <br /> <br />You still get the synths and all, but it is a tad bit harder than what DSOTM and WYWH were.  This is one of my favorite Floyd albums and is a must have for Floyd fans.   <br /> <br />Once you pop this in the CD player, just let it play.  This is one great journey from beginning to end; I won't tell you how many times I've listened to this thing in an altered state of mind, it is pure bliss.

6305128952|5.0|Many have already addressed the plot of this film, so I will not not go into detail. However, I feel compelled to touch upon the visual storytelling in this film.<br /><br />Movies are first and foremost imagery. As many legendary filmmakers have said, a good film can be watched with the sound turned off and still communicate every bit of the story and emotion through the images alone. This includes cinematography but goes light years beyond lighting and framing a scene. Each shot must be planned and designed, from sets to props to location scouting, from blocking the actors' movements to using color and shapes, textures, and spatial relationships. All these must communicate the text and subtext simultaneously.<br /><br />I said all that to say this: Redford and his team blew me away with \\"The Horse Whisperer.\\" The first act alone is filled with enough information in every corner of the screen to chew on for days. One example among dozens is the use of symmetry, parallel lines, and perpendicularity in the city scenes - even in the arrangement of books in the background, pens on a desk, or the window blinds in a hospital - to convey the superficially ordered control of Anne's life. This is contrasted with the organic sweeping curves of the farm landscapes where Grace's accident occurs. The confined spaces and straight streets of New York are gradually and gracefully replaced with the curves of the highways as Anne drives west until she reaches the Rockies in all their chaotically ingenious immensity.<br /><br />And apart from all this, I was also deeply effected emotionally by this movie. Yes, it takes its time telling the story. But such stories in our own lives take time to unfold. And real, subtle moments deserve as much time to play out as they need. Grace's recovery from the death of her friend and the injuries to the body and spirit of herself and her faithful horse Pilgrim are also expertly crafted. It has personal resonance in my family because we faced many of the same trials and frustrations when my wife was injured by a tornado a year after we married. She was touched and encouraged by this film.<br /><br />Thomas Newman's score is his masterwork. It brought me to tears during the end credits.<br /><br />Grace is also perfectly portrayed by the then-unknown Scarlett Johansson. Most people seem to forget she was in \\"The Horse Whisperer,\\" but I will always associate this film with Scarlett and her with it.rustrations when my wife was injured by a tornado a year after we married.

0440237688|2.0|Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.<br /><br />There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?<br /><br />Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things.  I would have liked more of a \\"fleshing out\\" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me.
B0002IU988|5.0|The music rocks, as it should.  You can listen to the whole cd and not want to skip any of the songs.  If you liked Creed's sound, you will like this CD.  I've already purchased my tickets to see/hear this music played live.
0375703764|5.0|This is a tricky review... this book was without a doubt my favorite book of the past year, but there are times during which it bored me (history of the Minotaur chapter).  This book is many stories in one; the (possibly) crazied researcher, the photographer in over his head, and the unsure twenty-something thrown into the mix.  But the mix of these three, with their own individual and well-defined voices, is what makes the book. <br /> <br />If one was to read this cover-to-cover you great a great story that just drags you down into it (like an expanding hallway).  Once I figured out part of this book I could not put it down.  This book is complex yet rewarding, slowly unfolding each part and leaving you with a new guess. <br /> <br />There are two things that push House of Leaves over the top for me.  The first is something not to do with the book, but with the sister of the author (Mark Danielewski).  The author's sister is the musician Poe and she wrote a CD in tandem with her brother writing this book.  The CD is called \\"Haunted\\" and the book and the CD play off of each other.  At one point I was reading about a girl sitting alone on stairs singing \\"Ba-da-ba-ba\\" to comfort herself, at the same time a song from \\"Haunted\\" that I was listening to went \\"The voices that are carrying this tune, Ba-da-ba-ba, Ba-da-ba-ba.\\"  It is a rare treat to have the world of a book be carried into another space such as music.  Musically the CD itself keeps its end up, matching the different styles of the book and keeping with its high level of quality. <br /> <br />The second great part of House of Leaves is that you can re-read the book and have an entirely different ride.  Throughout the book the chapters are divided into different voices.  If you go back and re-read just the photographer and the 20-something guy parts the House of Leaves turns into a credible thriller novel. Read a different combination and you receive a different feel.  It has been a while since I have been able to go back to a novel and come away with a new experiance.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I clearly remember going to the theatre to see this some 20 years ago.  I also remember being very skeptical that this movie could top the original.  The original was a classic,  great cinematography,  a superb cast,  and absolutely terrifying. <br /> <br /> <br />     Well they came out with a BADA$$ sequel!!!  Loaded with combat Marines,  Aliens all over the place,  and of course Sigourney Weaver being the butt kicking heroine tops it all.   <br /> <br /> <br />     If you liked the original,  if you like action movies,  grab this movie now.

B00004Z459|5.0|Alright, so one day I'm in a local cd store, blazing through the records. I have money almost literally burning a hole in my pocket. So finally, I see this album. I give it some thought, and you know, I couldn't help myself. As I'm checking out, the girl at the cash register tells me I'm gonna love this album. The only thing she messed up about that sentence is love is not strong enough of a word. This is the best cd I own, in a tie with \\"Reanimation\\", Linkin Park's second CD. Every song on this album ownz my soul. Alright, time for the reviews of each song:<br /><br />1. Papercut-This is such a great start!!!!! AWESOME song! 10/10<br /><br />2. One Step Closer-Awesome angry song. Quite a headbanger. 10/10<br /><br />3. With You-This is where they slow it down. However, this song is still quite good! 10/10<br /><br />4. Points of Authority-Go back to heavy. VERY good, also a single off of \\"Reanimation\\". 10/10<br /><br />5. Crawling-OH yeah, here's some gold. Another single off the album, this song is the first song of theirs I ever heard. It is just so awesome, my words cannot describe it. 15/10<br /><br />6. Runaway-Definately not as good as the last song. It could have been better, but it's still good. 9/10<br /><br />7. By Myself-Once again, another one that could have been better, but still is good. 9/10<br /><br />8. In The End-OMG. Wow. Another single. Another freaking awesome song, that makes this album worth 100 dollars even! 17/10<br /><br />9. A Place For My Head-The 3rd in our series of \\"could have been better, but still damn good!\\" 9/10<br /><br />10. Forgotten-At first I didn't like this song. But if you listen to it enough, it gets soooo awesome! 10/10<br /><br />11. Cure For the Itch-HAHAHA! This is a song done by the DJ, Mr. Hahn. It's basically just a few lyrics, with him doing his thing with technology. But it's an awesome listen! 11/10<br /><br />12. Pushing Me Away-Wow. Another \\"I cannot describe the AWESOMENESS of this song.\\" It is just SO FREAKING GOOD LIKE THE OTHERS!!!! 16/10<br /><br />Overall, I give this album a 15/10. Buy it now! If you don't like them, then you need to buy it so you at least have some good music in your collection!!!! And don't listen to ANYONE who says this music sucks, because they're on drugs! Hahahahaha. ROCK ON!
B000002GXX|5.0|This album was the last great album for the Eagles. The country rock sound, the harmonies and music can not be matched. My favorite song is....all of them. Sorry, can't pick just one. When listening in the car or at home, I listen to the whole CD. Hotel California was a commercial success, but a music failure. Thanks to Joe Walsh and others. Sorry Joe. Bill Szymczyk did a great job at producing this gem. Purchase this CD, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
6305627401|5.0|There are enough customer reviews here for anyone to make up their minds, so I just have one thing to add: <br /> <br />Making it a musical, now that was pure class.
0441172717|5.0|I have yet to read another book that I have enjoyed as much as Dune.  This book is absolutely essential science fiction.  Several things set Dune apart from average sci-fi, the paramount such thing being the Dune universe.   <br /> <br />Dune takes place in the FAR future, about 10,000 years after a war against \\"thinking\\" machines.  The war itself doesn't play a very large role in the story, in fact it's only mentioned a few times, but its repercussions constitute the most interesting part of the Dune universe: computers and other \\"thinking\\" machines are outrightly forbidden within the Empire.  For this reason, people must perform all the functions such machines would otherwise do for humanity.  For example, people known as Mentats are trained from birth to be capable of sublime feats of logic.  These people take the place of computers.  Interstellar space is traversed without computer navigation by Guild navigators who perform this task with the limited prescience granted them by the spice, Melange.   <br /> <br />Because of the fact that these types of technologies are eliminated from Dune, the book has a certain timeless quality to it.  It was not necessary for Frank Herbert to guess what kinds of computers and AI people would possess in such a far-flung time from his vantage point in the sixties.  In summary, a large part of Dune is about humans and their nearly infinite abilities of mind.  For people interested in the philosophy of \\"mind over matter,\\" this book is definitely, unquestionably for you.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|And that's all there is to it. It almost brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.
B000077VR3|5.0|Moulin Rouge:  <br />a story about truth, beauty, freedom, but above all: Love.  <br />This line sums up Moulin Rouge, a truely maqnificent musical drama that makes us all hungry for Love.  <br />The combination of drama, musical and comedy is hard to make believeable on the screen, but the movie's director, Baz Luhrman has pulled it off! <br /> <br />The actors, the sets, the music, the story: everything is the way it should be. It's all very beautifully done.  <br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor play the stars of the sky as the two lovers Satine and Christian. They act strong and both make you believe that what you see is what really happends. <br />They talk, sing and guide you through the movie with passion and love.  <br />The music is true enjoyment for your ears and you just feel like wanting to sing with them. <br />The style of the film is a fastpace but yet good to follow one.  <br />The story grabs you by the heart from the beginning and doesn't let go until the last letter of the credits has role over the screen.  <br /> <br />Moulin Rouge is true enjoyment for both eye and ear, but also for the heart and the soul. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll enjoy every second of this great spectacular, spectacular film! <br />And after seeying this film, the words \\"the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return\\" will always echoe in your mind.  <br /> <br />Spectacular entertainment you must not miss! <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"a music fan's\\" review preceding mine is misleading. kanye west is not revolutionary. he did not invent this sound; he merely popularized the methods perfected by native tongues artists and other alternative rap groups. this reviewer gave the album the props it deserves, but with the misguided enthusiasm of a fanatic. nevertheless kanye's sonic brainchild \\"college drop out\\" is genious work. a true work of art with a unifying theme, hillarious comedic work, mind-blowing production, cunning lyrics, and refreshing content overall. this complete musical package will be considered a classic in just a few years time.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I agree with a lot of what's been said before. This album is darker and less accessible than the previous one; there is less `filler'; it takes a hell of a lot of listens to get into it (it was around 20 before I started liking it); and the fact that on Avril's website you can listen to the whole album is exceptionally useful in deciding whether or not to buy it. I do, however, disagree with this whole debate on whether it's rock or whether it's punk or whatever. That doesn't really matter. All you have to ask is: do you like the music? Yes or no? The rest is marketing, and hype, and pointless.<br /><br />The album artwork is black, white and red, and that pretty-much fits what's on the CD. The happy, jangly `filler' on the first album were actually my favourite songs, and I certainly feel their lack, because this is the new streamlined Lavigne, issue-laden and angry in the way only a teenager can be. She is yet to record a song that is timeless, but Slipped Away and Nobody's Home actually come very close to all-time-classic status, and opener Take Me Away is awesome. Every track could be a single (and half of them probably will be) because they're all so well-written, and despite what some people have said (about the songs being Complicated Part II, Sk8ter Boi Part II, etc.), each song is distinct and accomplished in its own way. One of the best differences from the previous album is that the two singles so far (Don't Tell Me and My Happy Ending) actually get better with subsequent listens and don't start to grate on you.<br /><br />However, while I can't give this album a mere three stars, because of the undeniable talent on display, I have two major criticisms of it that are both in comparison with the previous album. While the songs are so well-written, they are in a similar vein, whereas `Let Go' had such a wide range that the `streamlined' Lavigne is the weaker for it. The other criticism is the lack of bass register. I didn't want to compare it to other `rock' CDs, but I'm going to have to. Generally when the distorted guitars kick in on rock CDs, the music gets louder but also bassier, so that you can `feel' the heaviness of the music. Bizarrely, when the music gets `heavier' on this CD, on most songs it only gets louder, and on some not even that. This wasn't a problem on the last record; on Losing Grip' when they guitars kick in, it's like: WOW! On the new album, Together and My Happy Ending, while fine songs, are prime examples of what's missing: the guitars have got so much treble they sound tinny and puny. This could be as a consequence of Lavigne's voice seemingly becoming higher in pitch since the last album, and they didn't want the bass to emphasise this fact. Or it could just be bad producing and mastering. Whatever the reason, it is to the detriment of the music because it strips away a lot of the power it could have had, and two months after buying the record I'm hardly listening to it at all.rock' CDs, but I'm going to have to.

B00001SIES|4.0|This is not an in-depth review of the album - in fact I've heard it only once. I don't know that much about Muse but I know plenty about the band to which they are so often compared. <br /> <br />My friend (a Muse fan) introduced me to this and compared it to Radiohead on account of the striking similarity of the vocals. I listened and I found what I have been looking for all along from RH. Radiohead was my favorite band once upon a time. This is reminiscent of them in the pre-OK Computer and post-Bends era(especially around the time of the My Iron Lung EP and the OK Comp. B-sides when they used to rock). I take this offering from Muse at face value...sure it's derivative, but it's what I have been waiting for from RH all along and those guys have not produced. Muse is on the right path...good and getting better. I love it and I am buying it as I write this and I will continue to listen as they progress. <br />
B0000C03AH|5.0|To my knowledge this is the third appearance of Karajan's 1963 Beethoven cycle available domestically on digital disc. You can still buy the previous boxed set issues DG429036 and DG453701. The latter is Volume 1 of DG's Complete Beethoven Edition issued in 1997. The recordings in that set are Original Image Bit Processed and represent a considerable improvement in sound quality over the previous one. There is also boxed edition with paper sleeves available as an import, which I assume contains the same 1997 remasters.<br /><br />I approached the purchase of this Hybrid SACD set with some trepidation because I couldn't find a pertinent review and because I had tried DG's SACD remastering of Karajan's 1977 performance of the 9th (in my opinion, the greatest on disc), but the sound was terrible. (If you want Karajan's 1977 9th, get the recent 2-CD reissue containing symphonies 5, 6 and 9--they are all great performances and excellent remasterings.)<br /><br />Anyway, I am relieved to report that these new transfers are a major improvement in sound over the previous issues. On the (stereo) SACD layers, the bass is full and balanced in relation to the other registers, and there is considerably more instrumental color and solidity of tone as well as spatial differentiation within the orchestral fabric. There is still noticeable hiss, but it is overshadowed by the enhanced vibrancy of the sound. In effect, these SACD remasterings bring the sound quality up to nearly modern recording standards.<br /><br />The CD layers sound much like the SACD layers, but with slightly less spatial differentiation and solidity. Even if you don't intend to play the discs on an SACD player, I still recommend purchasing this set over the other issues, unless your level of interest in the performances doesn't justify the additional expense.<br /><br />In the future, I hope that DG will do as well remastering more of Karajan's great performances for SACD. In particular, I would like to have his 1976-1982 Bruckner cycle in this format.have his 1976-1982 Bruckner cycle in this format. <br />
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THIS MOVIE WAS THAT THEY JUST DIDNT UNDERSTAND IT. ITS INDEED VERY COMPLICATED AND MAYBE A LITTLE DEEPER THAN MOST WILL EXPECT. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE FILM IS THAT IT FEELS MORE LIKE THE 8TH INSTALLMENT IN A SERIES THAN THE FIRST. WE ARE FORCED TO TRY AND COMPREHEND ENDLESS AND DETAILED BACKSTORIES, MOST OF WICH IS SAID AND NOT SHOWN MAKING IT EVEN HARDER TO REMEMBER WHO DID WHAT TO WHO. THE ACTING IS ABOVE AVERAGE WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS STAND OUT BEING MICHAEL SHEEN WHO STEALS THE SHOW WITHOUT EVEN TRYING. KATE BECKINSALE IS PASSABLE BUT SEEM A LITTLE SLUGISH IN HER PERFORMANCE AS SELEN, AND SCOTT SPEEDMAN CERTAINLY DESERVED A LITTLE MORE SCREEN TIME (WHICH CAN BE SAID FOR MOST ACTORS IN THIS FILM) ALL IN ALL ITS ENTERTAINMENT BUT I CANT SAY IM LOOKING FORWARD TO TOO MANY SEQUELS.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|In my review for \\"Let Go\\" I said that she would either be a big hit for years or fall off the face of the Earth in a heartbeat. Well, here it is - the sophomore effort - and results are mixed. This album is actually a step back for Avril lyrically (as if that were possible with lyrics like, \\"He was a Skater boy, `I said see you later boy'\\") it is just too simple - honest but childish - (ex: \\"...you gave me that kiss, It was something like this, It made me go oh-oh\\"; I can almost hear Hilary Duff laughing at her.) However, the music is more down to earth, but that is actually a bad because the loud strings might hide her mediocre singing (which doesn't come close to her last album). This album just doesn't hit the right cord at all; it's too much effort for such minimal result. <br /> <br />There are a few saving graces, however. Cute \\"punk-girl\\" songs like \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"My Happy Ending\\" are reminiscent of older Avril, and good attempts at feeling, such as, \\"How Does It Feel\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\" do hover near the \\"good song mark.\\" <br /> <br />As a whole the album is a wreck. A friend asked me if I thought I was being a little harsh on Avril, and I replied, \\"Well she was a little harsh on my ears.\\" BOTTOM LINE --- Good, entertaining, and a solid 4, but far from a Happy Ending!
B00003CXSP|2.0|WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT DIRECTOR RIDLEY SCOTT WAS INVOLVED IN THE SEQUEL TO THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A RAW THRILLING PIECE OF CINEMATIC HISTORY. I SAT PATIENTLY IN MY CINEMA CHAIR, GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS. IT WAS WHEN THE INFAMOUSE END SEQUENCE ARRIVED THAT I ACTUALLY TURNED TO THE PERSON SAT BESIDE ME AND ASKED &quot;IS THIS A JOKE?&quot; I FELT LIKE I WAS ON A NEW HIDDEN CAMERA SHOW AND THE FILM I WAS WATCHING WAS A GOFFY SETUP. SADLY, THE MOVIE WAS INDEED NOT A SETUP AND THIS WAS WHAT FANS HAD BEEN THROWN AFTER A VERY PROMISING BUILDUP. FOR ANYONE WHO CLAIMS HANNIBAL IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION; IF HANNIBAL LECTER IS SUCH AN INTELLIGENT MADMAN, SURELY HE WOULD KNOW TO GET OUT OF HANDCUFFS ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS CHOP OFF HIS THUMB AND NOT HIS WHOLE HAND. EVEN THE DUMBEST CRIMINALS KNOW THAT!!! LUCKILY RED DRAGON REDEFINED THE WORDS INTELLIGENCE AND SUSPENSE AND GAVE AUDIENCES THE PROPER ENTERTAINMENT THEY DESERVE.
B000001FZK|5.0|This album is worth the price just to hear the drumming alone, add to that the delicate wisps of Mark Hollis' vocals and the distinctive guitar lines, and you have yourself a major masterpiece.  This album and Spirit of Eden are two of my fave albums of all-time.  Other faves include \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\" by David Sylvian and \\"Jordan:The Comeback\\" by Prefab Sprout.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I rarely go see movies twice, but after taking my four children, I treated my parents and watched it again! You fall in love with Buddy, you just can't help it! Will Ferrell is not the kooky nut in this one as in most of his movies, he truly shows the innocent, sweetness of Buddy the elf. Full of laughs, and not as predictable as you might think. I just can't wait until it is released to purchase. I will own this one, please note that after viewing you will need to decorate your house for Christmas immediately !! :)
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Its about time. What more can we say? Anchor Bay has decided to release its ultimate DVD edition of George A. Romero's epic Zombie film, Dawn of the Dead.  Here are the specs. <br /> <br />DISC 1: The origian unrated director's cut.  NOT THE EXTENDED EDITION, which is not truly Romero's director's cut.  This disc includes commentary with George Romero, Tom Savini, and Chris Romero along with Theatrical trailers and radio spots.  <br /> <br />DISC 2: The extended edition, often mistaken for a 'director's cut.'  This disc includes an additional 12 minutes of glorious footage.  Also includes commentary by producer Richard Rubinstein, who also helmed the recent Dawn of the Dead remake. The disc has a commercial for the Monroville Mall and a memorabilia gallery. <br /> <br />DISC 3: The Dario Argento cut.  This version of the film has less humor and more drama, released in Europe with additional music from Goblin.  This version includes commentary by all four stars of the film. <br /> <br />DISC 4: This disc contains several documentaries including the all new THE DEAD WALK (75 min) and the classic DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD; a feature-length documentary shot during the making of Dawn of the Dead.  This disc also includes home movies from the set and a tour of the Monroeville Mall with actor Ken Foree.   <br /> <br />Buy this DVD set, you won't be sorry.  Even if you haven't seen the film, for any zombie fan, this is a must own.    <br /> <br />
B000286RKW|3.0|GoodFellas is on top of my \\"best films of all time\\" list.  I was one of the people who had bought the previous DVD edition, the infamous \\"two-sided, no features\\" release that had been one of the first generation of DVD releases, before the medium evolved into what it is today.  I had been counting the days until they would re-release this film, so I was first in line to get this new edition. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, though this edition is much better than the previous one, it very much pales alongside most modern DVD packages. <br /> <br />The package aroused many suspicions in me that this was a rush job.  Among my dissatisfactions: <br /> <br />- There's no booklet, leaflet, film histories, or printed material of any kind which generally supplements a two-disc release like this; <br />- The film is long, but still under the three-hour mark, and the second disc has three short (eight to 20 minutes), unremarkable documentaries plus a storyboard-film comparison.  Wouldn't all this material have fit on a single disc?  Dragon:  The Bruce Lee Story had three times the media and was only a single disc.   If they didn't have enough material, why did they put up the illusion that there are two discs' worth? <br />- There are only two commentaries, and one of them isn't even complete.  The \\"Cop and Crook\\" commentary is interesting, applying the great idea of bringing back Henry Hill (on whose life this film and its source book Wiseguy were based) and the prosecutor who had sponsored his Witness Protection Program, Edward McDonald.  It's not a very illuminating commentary, but it's still good to see what Hill is like today.  However, the \\"Cast and Crew\\" commentary is suspect.  Not only does it not cover the entire film, I actually suspect it was not recorded as a commentary, but edited from fragmentary interviews.  So rarely do the cast and director on this track comment on the specific scenes, the way a commentary should, that I don't think they were watching the film asthey were speaking; I think the production company simply mixed the sound louder and created the illusion that this was a commentary track.  I don't know for sure if this is the case, but if it is, I consider it very dishonest marketing.  Don't call it a commentary unless it is one! <br />- I found absolutely no new insights into Martin Scorsese or the film from the additional materials.  The \\"making of\\" documentary is the usual \\"heap praise upon the director\\" baloney.  Come on, do we actually *need* you to tell us that Scorsese is great?  How about giving some anecdotes and insight into the film instead? <br /> <br />All of the above adds up to a very underwhelming DVD release of a film that's possibly the greatest American film of the last 20 years.  However, there is still one incentive to own it -- the entire film is contained, without interruptions, on one disc.  So unlike with the old DVD release, you can actually watch the whole film now without having to turn the disc over.  So this is still the best available version of the film out there.  However, I remain displeased.  After years of waiting, and being disappointed, why does this edition fail to satisfy? <br /> <br />I can only hope that the impossible would happen -- that Warner Bros. would let The Criterion Collection take a stab at this film, and do it justice.  It will never happen, but the very idea does whet the appetite.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Ok, I tried to be nice but she deserves this. This album bites. She released all the songs that are half decent and left all the crappy remainders for those who were suckered into buying this trash.<BR>AND under NO circumstances should you repeat same songs in the album. What she could have done is put &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot; on one of the singles or something but she just forces you to listen to more of her music.<BR>This album is a mix between boring and downright painful to listen to. This is why downloading MP3s has become so popular. Because you could download &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; and &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot; then leave the rest on the shelf of the store and save your time and money.<BR>The highlight of this album was the pictures inside the sleeve.
0679428895|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book.  As the story of Pompeii is getting more coverage now TV, books, etc I find that this story is well written and easily read and quite informative.  The story helped you look at the people themselves and what they faced.  It gave a human look to the tragedy of that city.
B00006879E|5.0|This is the best band that has blended rock with soul that I can think of. I will always have this Album in my collection.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The third book was my absolute favorite in the series, as an adult fan of the series and an English major. However the movie disappointed me on several levels. First, they should have explained the mauraders map, wihtout an explanation it seems like a large an dumb coincidence that they happen to find a werewolf and two unregistered animagi in the book. On top of that, without the exlanation, Harry's Patronus appearing as a stag is random. Second, while the casting for everyone in previous movies was perfect, I didn't like the actor chosen for Lupin, (I had reservations about Black's actor not looking right, but those were overshadowed by his amazing acting skills) I found the actor playing Lupin to be weak, and somewhat dorky (for lack of a better word) I really don't understand the tweed suit they put him in either. I really hope the cut scenes clear up some of the problems. <br />    Besides these problems, the previous cast preforms well as always, and the three teens have grown well in their roles. The graphics for Buckbeak and the dementers was very good. The movie is worth seeing, I just hoped they'd do better. <br />
B00005JM02|4.0|Clownfish Marlin loses his entire family, except for his son, Nemo. Because of his loss, Marlin is an overprotective father, stifling Nemo, while trying to keep him safe. One day Nemo pushes his boundaries too far and is snatched up by a diver and put in a fish tank in a dentist's office. The rest of the movie is about Marlin trying to find Nemo and Nemo trying to escape.<br /><br />The animation in this film was stunning. At times, especially in the shipyard scenes, I actually forgot it wasn't a live action film that I was watching.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty humorous. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect as Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. The scenes in the dentist office are also funny, even if they do make you not want to have your teeth cleaned anytime soon.<br /><br />Just a warning, even though the film is rated G, there are some moments that can traumatize young children, starting at the point early in the movie when Marlin loses his family. There are other scary moments along the way that may not be suitable for young children.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I Had trouble differentiating the truthfullness and the constant bashing on men in this album. True, guys can be jerks, but girls can be, too. The album was awesome, I'll give her that. I'm a big fan, and \\"Take me Away\\" and \\"Together\\" are awesome, but sometimes she goes down on guys too much. I want a love song. Doesn't have to be a ballad, just about a working relationship. I do recommend this to punk-rock lovers. The plus is that this album isn't the 1950's perfect love fantasies sung by Elvis Presley. It is truthfull. You decide.
0024181900|5.0|(I should just end it there.)<br /><br />If you have not read this book, you are probably an inefficient writer.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This album is worth buying and worth five stars for \\"Anywhere I Lay my Head\\" alone.  The album as a whole absolutely sparkles. <br />'Nuff said.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I'm not sure how to describe this album. It's a bit more \\"rock\\" than her first album, but I'm not sure I like it as much. <br /> <br />Lyrically this album is about equal to her first effort. Sometimes I just don't like the lyrics, and so you can understand my point...  <br /> <br />Example#1: <br />\\"And I can't take it <br />It wasn't fake <br />It happened, you passed by\\" <br />   -Slipped away <br />I think the problem is the word \\"fake\\". I just have a problem with it being used in that context (its about her grandpa). <br /> <br />Example#2 <br />\\"Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead <br />Was it something I did, was it something you said?\\" <br />   -My happy ending <br />This is just bad use of rhyming, like she was desperate to make the song rhyme perfectly. It sounds bad. <br /> <br />Vocally this album isn't as good. In a lot of songs there is a key change and Avril has to sing higher. It sounds as if she's screaming. It sounds terrible and it happens on almost every song! <br /> <br />Musically I'm not sure if it's better or worse. It's different. The music is more \\"rock\\", as I said before but it makes the songs blend into each other. <br /> <br />There are a few of songs I really like: <br />  \\"How does it feel\\" <br />  \\"Who knows\\" <br />  \\"Freak out\\" <br /> <br />And some I don't like... <br />  \\"Take me away\\" <br />  \\"Together\\" <br />  \\"Forgotten\\" (which I don't think I've actually been able to listen to all the way through.) <br /> <br />I guess now I can conclude that I like her first album is better. This album is not terrible though. <br />Do I suggest you go out and buy it? <br />Wait for a sale. <br /> <br />
B00008YLV2|4.0|One of Ridley Scotts best films. He had a bit of a dry period but now hes bounced back with Black Hawk Down.The start of the film introduces us to Matt Eversman Spec Grimes Pvt Blackburn and the rest of Task Force Ranger.There mission amongst others is to get Aidids top leutenants and be back in 1hr.Things go wrong as Supersix one and Supersix four are shot down over Mog.The film is truely riverting at some points unberable to watch. Theres non of the patriotic flag waving of saving private ryan this film shows whats it like to be in a firefight.At some points the film is hard to follow so if you want to truely understand what happend on OCT 3 then read mark bowdens great novel.There is just one problem with the film which prevents me from givin it a 5star rating. Why the hell does it have Sgt Eversman as the main character he never even went near the crash sight in fact he and his Chalk 4 went through hell in the lost convoy. Sadly Chalks 1,2,3 roles in the film are downsized when really their the ones who fort the battle anyway ingnore my winging this films an instant classic.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Wow! I never thought I'd see a documentary in theaters before this came along! I don't know why everyone made such a big deal about it being biased. It was SUPPOSED to be biased! Filmstatic.com even did a funny article about this. This is a skillfully made documentary that gets its point across.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|It wasn't a highly scandalous book by her daughter (Mommie Dearest), nor the largely inaccurate, cult-favorite movie that followed. Mildred Pierce made Joan Crawford a legend. Here we are treated to Joan in all her gorgeous shoulder-padded, glam bitch, vulnerable downtrodden heroine glory. It is not only a magnificent, Oscar-winning performance, but a performance that established a true American icon.  In life and in art, Joan will always be one of the true greats--and one that suffered the most unfounded and unjust persecution of any actress besides Frances Farmer. <br /> <br />See Mildred Pierce if you ever wanted to know why Joan was one of the greats.
B000000OQY|4.0|Si sos fanatico de GNR es un disco muy bueno, pero no muy extenso (33 min. aprox.). Son 8 temas: los 4 primeros en vivo y los otros 4 acusticos (incluye You're Crazy de Appetite... en version acustica). Si quieres escuchar a GNR cuando comenzaba a ser conocido, te recomiendo los temas en vivo, reeditados dentro de este disco debido a que se incluyeron en un primer EP (Live Like!?@ a Suicide) del cual solo se hicieron unas miles de copias y luego de agotarse, se vendian por muchos $$$, haciendo imposible que los fanaticos sin poder adquisitivo puedan escucharlos. Los temas acusticos son un complemento para nada despreciable. Es un disco recomendable.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All though you dont get the authenticity of a real beatles album, this is a great compilation of all there hits, with a lot of songs on it, definitly worth buying
B000002JSJ|3.0|This is one of Led Zeppelin's weaker albums, in my opinion.  \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" ranks up there with Zeppelin's best work.  But the rest of the album is not up their usual standards.  I know that some people think that \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is one of their best songs, but I think it's overrated.  Start off with Led Zeppelin's earlier albums before you buy this one.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although not the Beatles best cd's its definitly a very good one that includes some great songs, although if are thinking of buying a Beatles CD I would suggest THE WHITE ALBUM before ABBEY ROAD, its just plain better
B00000DOY9|3.0|This is one of Led Zeppelin's weaker albums, in my opinion.  \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" ranks up there with Zeppelin's best work.  But the rest of the album is not up their usual standards.  I know that some people think that \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is one of their best songs, but I think it's overrated.  If you only buy one Led Zeppelin album, it shouldn't be this one.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is the BEST concert i have ever seen in the entire life !! The coustomes are fabulous !! The sound effect are fabulous, and of course, her songs are fabulous. Everything is perfect !! BUY IT NOW !! There's no regret !!!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I\\"M A VIETNAM VETERAN ERA(1965-1966), I TRIED TO WATCH THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE, BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS SORT OF TRIPE <br />IS MR MOORE'S SLANTED AND BIGOTED VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROPAGADA FILM COULD BE VIEWED AS ANYTHING ELSE..........
B00005ATQF|5.0|This is one of the best war movies ever. The beginning scenes at the boot camp set the stage for what follows and helps to learn what it took to become a Marine. Kubrick's directing is top notch as usual. After watching this you'll be singing the Mickey Mouse song in your dreams.
B00013RC9I|5.0|AIR sounds like never before.  The first two albums i would describe as brilliant. This one isn't anymore, the unique squeak is gone. VIRGIN SUICIDES was powerful and a bit anguish. This one isn't anymore. 10000 HZ LEGEND was really interesing in it's diversity. This one isn't anymore. TALKIE WALKIE has no interesting turns in it, no indications to rock sound anymore, no good-old power.    But...  The soud is dreamier than ever. It is the dreamiest album, i've heard! And it's not this difficult hidden hard-to-understand sound, but totally mainstream. All this beautiful-beautiful world jumps into your ears without you even claiming for it.  There's also a threat in it. Remember what they blamed MOBY at the end? That his music was only good for commercials- too polished and good-sounding, not interesting at all. I can see the same threat here. Almost.    But so far everything is perfect. The sound is perfect. I'm a dreamer and i like it. If you're a dreamer too, i believe, you'll like it too.  (OH, and if you haven't seen the video for CHERRY BLOSSOM GIRL yet, don't watch it. It ruined the song for me. The video is so negative and depressing. You should see only positivity and beautiful hopes in AIR's dreamy world!)
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is a war satire that drives home a very important (and still too familiar in post-Cold War America) point about nuclear warfare. the characters are hilarious. Sellers, in his 3 roles, has you on the floor laughing. Surprisingly, so does Scott. The film scenes are realistic with tight spaces or documentary-worthy war footage. The acting is great. The directing is phenomenol. There is not a single bad thing about this movie. The ending is comical and very, very dark. I could watch this movie daily and not be tired of it.
B0002IU988|5.0|Mark and Flip have definitely turned in the right direction.  They have Brian back and Myles is a great singer and fits right in with the guys.  I already have my tickets to see them when they come to Philly.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Wow this cd is so amazing the lyrics and amazing guitar just blends together for an unforgettable experience. It's like the cd takes you on a journey every time you listen to it.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|The movie is fun, the music is great, the costumes are genuinely mind boggling.  The World of Wonder boys have outdone themselves on this one, a superb achivement all the way around.  Oh, it's easy to nitpick--so let me indulge myself.  How is it for example that in other movies and shows Seth Green looks like a normal human being and here he looks so short?  Surely the real James St. James is bigger than a<br /><br />Mia Kirshner is beautiful, plus, but what is she doing in this movie, has her career sunk this low?  She had a good gig on TV's 24 playing the airborne terrorist Mandy, and here she's just slumming.  Man is that also true of John Stamos!  Call your agent immediately and fire his ass!  He's the one who got you this one-minute part in a ten thousand dollars movie where nobody can recognize you anyhow and you don't even have a name to your character.<br /><br />Dylan McDermott, as Kirshner's husband, does a fine job in a very different kind of part for him.  And Wilmer is very good, awfully cute.  I did think that Seth Green and Macaulay Culkin, playing gay, are both very appealing but they're also indicating all over the place, as though to say in every frame, \\"I'm just acting, I'm not really gay.\\"  And so through the whole movie, it's played so stylized that in the end, we don't really care about any of the characters.  Except maybe for the mother of Michael Alig who's played here by Christina Crawford herself--Diana Scarwid--once a sort of big name in the movies--remember her in RUMBLE FISH for example?  And now, what does she do except appear vacant and messed up and tired?
B00005PJ8O|5.0|George C. Scott who plays General Patton in this movie gives his best acting performance! In fact, I consider it one of the best acting performances ever on film! <br />The only downside to the movie would be technical, concerning the tanks which were not of the WWII era.  <br />Besides that it's close to perfect!
B00000JCEC|5.0|Besides the Ringo record back in 73 with the other lads, this is his best CD. Great songs, great production, great drum fills, yes folks great drum fills. \\"What goes around\\" has not a complicated drum fill towards the end, but an original fill that fits the song well, and something I would never think about drumming myself. I have to admit that every song on the CD is very good. Upbeat, good rthy guitar work, Ringo voice pretty good, and nice backround singers. It is a little more of a rockin CD compared to some others.  <br />If you like this CD get OLD WAVE as well. Not as strong production wise, but the Joe Walsh song In my car, and Everybody's in a hurry but me with EC on guitar, and John Entwistle is cool. Interesting tom work by Ringo.
B0002IU988|5.0|This CD is amazing!!! Scott Phillips drumming has definitely improved since his days in Creed. It's good to have Brian Marshall back playing bass. Mark's guitar playing is without a doubt beyond words on this album. I've always been a fan of his, but this time he's just pushed the envelope. Myles Kennedy is an awesome vocalist. He fits so well with the rest of the band. The lyrics on this cd are outstanding. I highly recommend this cd to anyone. If you don't already own it, go out and buy it.
B000244FDW|4.0|I like this adaptation despite its studio and videotape limitations. I think it starts very slowly and when Lizzie says the 'it is a truth universally acknowledged' line my jaw just dropped at its clunkiness. However, it picks up after the first hour and I particularly like Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth and Priscilla Morgan as Mrs Bennet (Alison Steadman in the 1995 version is just ridiculous). <br /> <br />One thing I would like to mention is that both this version and the 1995 version are BBC productions. Both were co-productions, 1980 with the Australian Broadcasting Commission and 1995 with A&E, but essentially they were both made by the BBC.
B0000CABBW|5.0|OK, it's been a while since this movie came out, but I finally felt I had to put in my 2 cents because of some of the more recent reviews which are just plain ignant in places.    First of all, the capsule: This is one of the great, great movies of all time.  It's much more subtle (and kinder) than Once Were Warriors but perhaps translates a little less immediately for people outside of Polynesia because Niki Caro, herself a Pakeha (British-descended, non-Maori) New Zealander, doesn't feel compelled to explain Maori culture to outsiders.  This reflects the increasing familiarity of many New Zealanders of all races and cultural backgrounds with Maori culture and in this respect it is the most mature bicultural film to come out of Aotearoa. However, at the same time, this does make it a bit harder for the poor old foreigners to understand or feel the more nuanced parts  of the wairua (spirit) of this movie.    This is a movie that is uplifting, humane and deeply emotional. Anyone who thinks there is a \\"man-bashing\\" agenda here must have brought that particular mindset in with them. There are plenty of men who support Pai in the movie: her dad, her uncle, her friend Hemi (in an ungainly, preteen kind of way). Anyway, I digress.  This movie rocks, and Niki Caro, the cast, and especially Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai), Rawiri Paratene (Koro) and Vicky Haughton (Nanny Flowers) deserve huge praise for their wonderful work.    On to the more cultural stuff: First of all, if anyone has said this before then my apologies, but Koro is a modern Maori even if he has some old-fashioned ideas. He lives in the 21st century and is dealing with 21st century issues.  This idea that only white people or people who live in cities are modern is something that continues to annoy me intensely.  Although the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it, there are plenty of reasons why Koro is so desperate to find \\"the one\\": The hopelessness of the young people in the community, the lack of opportunity and an aimlessness that leads kids to drugs, gangs and to a systematic loss of faith in themselves and in their future.  These things are at once familiar to anyone who works with rural young people in almost any industrialized country and also specifically a local issue because of the idea among quite a few people (including, sadly some of the kids themselves) that Maori youth and in particular rural Maori youth are expendable in the market-driven, vacuous, ad-saturated world of  mainstream consumerist New Zealand society. Having spent some time in the far north of the country (in and around the Hokianga), I could recognize a lot of the kids and the older young people in the secondary characters of the movie.    That said, Koro is a traditionalist within the context of his particular part of the world and he does hold to the notion that women don't have the nature to wield the kind of mana (spiritual power) that is required of a chief.  Nanny Flowers on the other hand, comes from the Arawa people where women did and do hold political power.  Moreover she herself is descended from the great chiefess Muriwai,  This is one of the reasons why she continually helps Pai and resists Koro's attempts to demean Pai just because she was born a girl.  Flowers' stance is just as \\"traditional\\" as Koro's so this movie (in its typical, quiet way) challenges us to not to get too comfortable with easy pigeon-holing.     I also want to take issue with the people who felt the whole thing with the whales was too \\"New Age-y\\".  In traditional Maori understanding, specific groups of people are connected by genealogy to landscapes, rivers, mountains and other natural resources including animals and plants.  The original Whalerider, Paikea, established the link between the Ngati Konohi (the community shown in the movie) and the whales. As relatives, the whales are bound by obligations to the people, just as the people are bound by obligation to the whales. Koro's inability to call tothe ancestors reflects the fact that he has lost some part of his mana as a descendant of Paikea because of his foolish adherence to the form of tradition, rather than its spirit.  The whales beach not because Pai called them too close to the shore, but because their plight mirrors the plight of the people (directionless, failing and blind).  This issue was downplayed by the director, and is the only place where, in my  humble opinion, Niki Caro's instincts as a film-maker perhaps over-rode the need for an explicit narrative to the detriment of the film as a whole.    The whole issue of how to blend the \\"traditional\\" with the \\"modern\\" is the central axis of this movie.  It's just a guess but I think that the reason why this movie was so incredibly popular when it finally made it here to Hawai`i was that it suggested that you can marry the two (tradition and modernity) together.  That traditions can be changed without losing their ability to keep people strong and moral. That while traditions are the root that makes the tree strong, the branches of the tree should adapt to their own specific situation.  The question of how to apply traditional ideas to modern contexts is one of the big issues facing colonized and disenfranchised peoples everywhere.      However, (and let me be clear about this) this is a different issue from the idea of cultural authenticity and cultural identity. No-one would argue that Europeans (or Euro-Americans, or Euro-New Zealanders) should practice 18th century European culture in order to be considered \\"authentic\\" white people.  Why the heck should native people be held to a different standard?     One thing that might make some of this clearer, is to watch the \\"making of\\" documentary in the special features part of the DVD. This is a really nice piece of documentary film-making and it gives a much better sense of the real Maori community who hosted the film crew but also the tremendous pride and sense of connection that the actors and crew(both Maori and Pakeha) felt to the community and to the wairua that lies behind the film.  Without the real people and the real culture, this would have just been a pretty story in a beautiful landscape.  The reality is much, much deeper.    One other thing that might help people understand Whale Rider a little better is to learn a bit more about Maori culture.  Some suggestions are:  novels: \\"The Bone People\\" by Keri Hulme; anything by Witi Ihimaera (including the book the movie was based on \\"The Whale Rider\\" although for my money, \\"Tangi\\" is better), and Patricia Grace's \\"Potiki\\". In non-fiction:  \\"Making Peoples\\" by James Belich, \\"Two Worlds\\" by Anne Salmond, \\"Tikanga Whakaaro\\" by Cleve Barlow (fairly rare these days but a great resource as is Hiwi and Pat Tauroa's \\"A guide to customs and protocol\\"), \\"Tikanga Maori\\" by Hirini Mead which is also very good but much denser and Linda Tuhiwai Smith's \\"Decolonizing Methodologies\\".  Avoid anything by Alan Duff until you have some familiarity with what's really going on in Maori culture.  Once you know something, you can also go back and look at movies like \\"Once Were Warriors\\" and \\"Utu\\" and appreciate the things they say (and don't say).    Niki Caro, Witi Ihimaera and the cast and crew of Whale Rider have made a beautiful and memorable addition to world literature.  It's great as a story about an individual, but it's true greatness comes as a story about a people.
B000002UAO|5.0|6 albums in 3 years!!! Rubber Soul being the epoch of all the albums from this era. Dubbed their first \\"contemporary\\" album, the Beatles displayed why they are the greatest rock group ever! Robert Zimmerman's influence is peppered throughout thanks mostly to John. All originals, all classic tracks that are as fresh today as Yesterday (pun intended). When looking at the track list, it's hard to call any of these weak, but if I had to choose which ones I thought were weak it would be Drive My Car, What Goes On, Michele, and Run For Your Life.    Some may be thinking I am nuts to include Drive My Car and Michele as the weak tracks. Drive my Car has a great guitar hook and raucous vocals, but it's not a very good song IMHO as compared to the other tracks. Still, it is an integral part of the album as the opening riff begins, you know you are listening to Rubber Soul! As for Michele, well, Pauls bubblegum has always been a bone of contention with me. It's a really beautiful tune as far as sunny love songs go, but I am a Lennon guy, so I am jaded. Again, it is a very integral part of the album and I wouldn't have it any other way.    The best songs on this album are Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, Word, Girl, I'm Looking Through You, and In My Life. Honorable mentions to You Won't See Me, Think For Yourself, Wait and If I Needed Someone. Basically the whole album is pure gold! Norwegian Wood is my all-time favourite Beatles song. It's a bold thing to say, I know, given the volume of great material. If I were to list my top 5 favorite Beatles albums it would be as follows....    1. Revolver  2. Rubber Soul  3. Sgt Pepper  4. Magical Mystery Tour  5. Beatles For Sale    I've said it before and I will say it again, I will not tell you to buy this album first, just get them all! This is not a bad place to start though. In fact it may be the best album to start off with. I know I just contradicted myself. Oh well!
B00003CXA6|5.0|If you have even the slightest interest in The War of Northern Aggression you HAVE TO GET THIS MOVIE! It is the most accurate telling of what really happened those hot days in July so long ago. Ted Turner has spent millions to make this tale true to history. (Look for him in a cameo.) <br />As he did in \\"Gods and Generals\\" which I also bought.  <br />I cannot wait for the third and last in the trilogy to come out. <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|Rated the best album of all time by their peers, the Beatles Revolver is a very exciting album. Keep in mind that no one was doing this at the time. Backwards guitars, sound effects, experimental one chord songs. It is quite amazing indeed. John Lennons last master-piece as leader before Paul began exerting more of an influence. <br /> <br />The album has some short-comings, but the sheer intelligence and experimentation makes up for it. Songs like Yellow Submarine, I Want To Tell You, and Good Day Sunshine are the closest thing you'll get to the weaker tracks. While Taxman, I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, Here There and Everywhere, For No One, Doctor Robert, and the immortal Tomorrow Never Knows show how much they were willing to push the boundaries of sonic barriers. George Harrisons contributions were overshadowed IMHO. In fact, George is directly and in-directly responsible for the direction in which they embarked on. It was Georges Dentist friend who introduced them to LSD. It was George who brought in the sitar in 1965 for the Rubber Soul album and then turned everyone on to Indian music. It was Georges attempt at writing Indian songs that gave John the idea for Tomorrow Never Knows. You can almost give full credit to George for jump starting the psychedelic era in music. Oh, and did I mention the grammy award winning album cover (Thanks Klaus)? <br /> <br />The Stones could only wish to be so creative. Everytime the Beatles pioneered something new, the Stones would copy it. In fact, the Stones started their career as a cover band and then one day the Beatles taught them how to write their own songs. Even then, they still covered a Beatles song. It seems fitting that those who \\"hate\\" the Beatles so much, fail to realize what an impact they had on every artist of the time and especially on the Stones. I read a good amount of the reviews for this and other Beatles albums. I have to say, who ever keeps writing reviews under the A Music Fan and rating the album as one star, please stop. It's pathetic to see you wasting your life due to your obvious envy of the greatest band of all time!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I have been a fan of Johnny Cash since my dad bought his \\"Love, God, and Murder\\" collection a few years ago. A while ago I fell in love with \\"American 3: Solitary Man\\" and though that album is still my favorite, this is a great collection of originals and covers that will bring you to your knees. The title track is the best Johnny Cash original that I have ever heard, showcasing his talent for lyrics and melody. The covers, which take up the majority of this album, are some of the best I have ever heard. He truly makes these songs his own, including the brilliant \\"Hurt\\" (Watch the Video!), \\"Desperado\\", and \\"Personal Jesus\\". Most of the covers are as good or better than the originals. The only exception may be his cover of \\"In My Life\\", which I feel is probably the weakest track and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. \\"Danny Boy\\" was probably uneccesary too. The darkly humerous \\"Sam Hall\\" harkens back to Cash's earlier work and provides some comic relief in the middle of the album. And I can't think of a better way to end the album than the jazzy \\"We'll Meet Again.\\" This album will make you cry, yet it's incredibly uplifting at the same time.
B00008MNYS|4.0|There are reviews here that would have you believe this is Robbie's best. To use a word Robbie would understand, that's rubbish. For one thing, this is too long at 61 minutes, resorting at times to songs that should have been B-sides. For another, it's essentially the same as 2002's UK version, which was widely available here through the wonders of the internet. <br /> <br />While it isn't Robbie's best album--either Sing When You're Winning or the crooner follow-up, Swing When You're Winning, should have that distinction--there's a lot to like here, and the new and updated songs are interesting. I just wish the US version still had \\"Hot Fudge\\" and cut out a bit of the filler.
B000002BHE|5.0|'Falling Into You' is, without a doubt, Celine's best work to date. The lyrics are timeless, the melodies are classic, and her voice is superb. I am not lying when I say this is my absolute favourite album to date. Because I've owned in since its 1996 release, I know every bit of every song off by heart, and I could never even imagine not owning this CD. The thing which Celine takes the most hits for is the fact that she doesn't write her own songs. I do hold a certain respect for musicians who are able to both sing and write, or at least give an effort into the writing process. True, Celine doesn't write, but she has one of the most amazing voices of our time, and the songwriters who contributed to 'Falling Into You' are amazingly talented. Coupled together, that's what makes this album a masterpiece. <br /> <br />The album begins with the seven minute, 37 second power ballad 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now'. It's a magnificent, beautiful choice to start the album with. Written by Jim Steinman, Celine delivers the goods with her powerful voice. Who knows if the story of a past lover returning is true or not, either way, Celine makes listeners believe in what she's singing. The second track, 'Because You Loved Me' is one of Celine's most famous songs. If not the most memorable, it's certainly tied for first (along with the likes of 'If You Asked Me To' and 'My Heart Will Go On'). It was written by the fantastically talented Diane Warren, and was the theme from the film 'Up Close & Personal'. Next comes the title track of the album, 'Falling Into You'. This is quite a slow, sultry, and altogether extremely sexy song. Both Celine's vocals and the music provide an atmosphere that almost seems reminiscent of a dream.  <br /> <br />'Make You Happy' is the fourth song , and the first up-beat track on the album. The lyrics and music go very well with Celine's voice, and showcase her talent at performing, not only slow songs, but faster ones as well. The fifth track, Seduces Me' follows much the same form as 'Falling Into You'. Both are slow, and sensual. Celine's voice breathes throughout the track beautifully and calmly in barely more than a whisper. It's an exquisite song. 'All By Myself' is a remake of Eric Carmen's timeless classic. Celine delivers the immortal song passionately and truthfully, and the end result is simply amazing. 'Declaration of Love' is another one of the more up-beat tracks found on 'Falling Into You'. Written by Michael Jay and Claude Gaudette, the lyrics are fun and Celine manages to pull off the fast track surprisingly well. The eighth song, 'Dreamin' of You' is one of my favourite tracks on the album. The vocals are amazing, the music is beautiful, and the lyrics are sweet and charming.  <br /> <br />'I Love You' is the second of three songs Aldo Nova wrote on 'Falling Into You' (he co-wrote 'Dreamin' of You' and single-handedly wrote 'I Love You' and 'Your Light'). It opens beautifully with the lyrics \\"I must be crazy now/Maybe I dream too much/But when I think of you/I long to feel your touch\\". It's among the best on the album. The tenth song on the album is 'If That's What it Takes'. The music is absolutely breathtaking, and the song as a whole is deeply touching and romantic. 'I Don't Know' is among my personal favourite tracks. Lyrically, it's about knowing you can face many different obstacles (including \\"the bitter cold\\" and \\"love in vain\\") but unsure as to whether you can live without someone. The music is simple and fits well with the lyrics and vocals. 'River Deep, Mountain High' is a remake of Tina Turner's classic. Celine plays tribute to Tina by altering one of the lines to \\"just like Tina loves to sing\\", and pulls off the track unexpectedly well.  <br /> <br />'Your Light' is a great track. It's very up-beat and country in sound, which doesn't make someone think of Celine Dion, but she makes it her own, and the end result is stunning. 'Call The Man' is, without a doubt, the best song on theentire album. It's painfully heart wrenching and magnificently sung. The lyrics are meaningful and deep, and Celine makes you believe in what she's singing. Take the opening verse for instance,  <br /> <br />\\"Close the door <br />Shut the world away <br />All the fight's gone from this <br />Wounded heart <br />Across the floor <br />Dreams and shadows play <br />Like wind-blown refugees\\" <br /> <br />Spectacular. The last song on the album is 'Fly'. It's dedicated to Celine's niece, Karine, who died of Cystic Fibrosis. It's sweet and sad. Celine sings it slowly and quietly, almost as if she's on the verge of tears. A beautiful song choice for the end of the album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a stunning album. It's an absolute masterpiece, and I recommend it to everyone. If you're a fan of Celine Dion, you should already own this album, as it is, by far, her best work. If you don't already own 'Falling Into You', rush out and buy it now! You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />THE FINAL VERDICT: 99%
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years now, ever since DVD's have come out, and it's about time. This series is amazing!  I highly recommend this DVD set, it is a great collector's item for fans. I only have one question... when is the deluxe Star Wars six pack going to come out?
6304078145|1.0|Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill 1 and 2) and Robert Rodriquez (Desperado, Once Upon A Time In Mexico) are a great team...think Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn....but man does this movie suck. I was expecting what others were expecting from the 2 of them...a great frickin movoie. Tim Roth (Resevoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) plays the bellhop of the movie and he goes around and he is linked in with everysingle story in the movie. One being Antonio Banderas (The Body, Play It To The Bone) and his crazy ass wasted performance. A coven of wiccas, Madonna (Swept Away, Evita), Alicia Witt (Urban Legend, Vanilla Sky), Lili Taylor (Ransom, Haunting), Marisa Tomei (The Watcher, What Women Want), Ione Skye (Rivers Edge, Dream Of An Insomniac)....A woman and her jealous boyfriend and Quentin Tarantino and his appearance. Nothing really is great about anything in this movie. It's really embarrassing to watch all this talent go down the dumps for 98 minutes..truly embarrassing and why Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard) has a cameo in this movie I sure as hell dont know. Muck from the bottom of the truck. Also starring Valeria Golino (Escape From LA), Salma Hayek (Frida, Traffic), Jennifer Beals (Vampires Kiss, Flashdance) and Kathy Griffin (Pulp Fiction, NewsRadio).
B00006AW2G|5.0|There are some albums that should just be left alone. The ones that are perfect to begin with need no remastered version, because there is no way it could be any better. After listening to the original \\"Let It Bleed\\" one would believe that this is a perfect album. However, when the remaster was released, some of us were shocked to find a different song order than the original release, and we thought, \\"Another classic album... screwed up by those crazy producers.\\" Then, we actually listened to it, and found, to our extreme amazement, the song order is actually much better. It transists so much more smoothly than the original, and I must say it's better to have the epic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" finishing off the album than the album's weakest track, \\"Country Honk.\\" <br /> <br />The 2nd of the 4 Jimmy Miller-produced albums was released at a very confusing time. The summer of love was dead to some people before the infamous Altamont concert, but after that was finished, it was clear that an era had ended. A free festival to promote peace, love, and the Stones' music had ended in four deaths, one of them a murder. The Stones defined the mood of the end of the summer of love on \\"Let It Bleed,\\" with 9 songs of dark apocalypse, loneliness, and ultimately, hope. <br /> <br />The Remaster begins darkly with \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" a song about being lost and not knowing where to turn, just looking for some shelter to hide you from the confusion of the outside world. The track features arguably the greatest back-up vocal performance of all time in Mary Clayton. <br />Following those visions of confusion is a downright depressing track, a reworking of Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain.\\" The song follows the separation of two lovers as the female departs via train from the male's world.  <br />Next comes \\"Country Honk,\\" in a much better track position than on the original. Here it provides relief from the preceding dark tracks, a method used profusely by underground groups such as Love and The Velvet Underground. \\"Country Honk\\" takes \\"Honky Tonk Woman,\\" moves it even further into the deep south, and proceeds to play it as it might be heard at a Square Dance. <br />Another song of apocalypse comes in \\"Live With Me,\\" as the impeccable bass line (Actually not played by Bill Wyman. Not sure why.) leads into Charlie Watts' driving drum beat and gives us one hard-rocking track. One of my personal favorites on the album (There's a pretty nice live version on \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.). <br />Following that rocking moment is a very hopeful song, the title track, \\"Let It Bleed.\\" Ian Stewart gives a great performance on piano, as Mick Jagger sings about the joy of being able to hold on to someone in the confusion of it all. Definitely one of the standout tracks. <br />Of course, following the most hopeful song on the album, we are given the darkest, creepiest, most lyrically scary song on the album, \\"Midnight Rambler.\\" The song paints images in your head of the darkest night you could ever imagine, and the Boston Strangler lurking around inside of it, looking for his idea of a \\"good time.\\" It's absolutely terrifying to listen to the lyrics.  <br />Next comes Keith Richards's first lead vocal of the Stones' career. \\"You Got The Silver\\" is another relief track, a basic love song. Mick Jagger also did a version of this, but his was reportedly not as good as Kieth's. <br />\\"Monkey Man\\" comes next, and sets the scene in its first line: \\"I'm a flea-bit, peanut monkey. All my friends are junkies... that's not really true.\\" However, during the instrumental break, a guitar comes in, playing the unmistakable music of hope. It sounds absolutely beautiful. <br />The Remaster ends with what some will call the Stones' tour de force (I am one of these people.), \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" This song is absolutely beautiful, and a perfect lesson to end off the album, because as much as it sucks, you really can't always get what you want. You just have to deal with all the crappy stuff that happens, but if you try it some times, you just might find, you get what you need. A perfect ending. A fantastic album. An immortal band. If you are looking for your first Stones' studio album, \\"Let It Bleed\\" is the perfect introduction. This album is, simply put, amazing.
B000000WF0|5.0|I heard (like most people) this album first among their releases, and I find it the most accessible.  But over time I like Northern Soul and A Storm in Heaven (in that order) almost as much.  If you're trying to figure out which to buy first,  then the earlier 2 are edgier and less polished. You'll probably get all three, and then the e.p.'s, so enjoy the tragic adventure of the band that should've sold like Radiohead...

B00028HBKM|4.0|For all the vitriol spat at this movie, it's hard to take seriously any review that isn't at least 2 or 3 stars.  This movie warrants that for its artistry and acting alone.  The way words are conveyed through expressions and symbols that are more universal than the Christian religion itself makes one understand why Mel Gibson did not initially find it necessary to release this movie with subtitles.    In the story of the last hours of Christ, we have a compelling story of betrayal, denial, greed, forgiveness, anger, envy, redemption and just about every single element that the Bible identifies as a fundamental flaw or attribute.  What we see onscreen is not some anti-Semetic screed.  Far from it.  Gibson has taken liberties only in the scourging scenes that are performed by the Romans and in two flashback scenes meant to illustrate the human bond between he and his mother Mary.  Both the Jews and Pilate are portrayed the way they are portrayed in the New Testament and herein lies the problem.  For the fundamental divide between Christians and Jews is the story of Jesus and the New Testament.  The New Testament is in and of itself anti-Semetic to many because of the way the death of Jesus has been used for hundreds of years to stereotype and persecute Jews.  There are complaints about historical inaccuracies, but this seems like nitpicking in a movie that is so obviously relying upon faith and the book of that faith.  You can't blame Jews for being sensitive to this issue, but the kneejerk negative reaction is both out of line and outdated for modern America.    As for the film itself, Gibson has made an endurance test, but it all has a purpose.  Those who say the lessons of Jesus are not conveyed in this film must not have watched it.  For they are clearly and artfully conveyed through a series of well-placed flashbacks that tie in to the current situation being acted out on film.  The underlying theme of forgiveness is emphasized on multiple occasions, so the serious watcher will not come away with the impression that he or she should go out and kill some Jews.  At worst, they may come away with the condescending belief that they should openly forgive modern Jews for whatever ills their ancient ancestors inflicted upon Jesus.    This is a movie about faith and reinforcing that faith by showing the suffering of Christ in his last hours-- the suffering that he apparently endured for all of man's sins. It is a very Catholic film in that sense because it really pushes the guilt-ridden side of Christian theology (i.e. Jesus died for us all so feel so terrible about it that you never forget it).  But whether you believe in Jesus Christ or the historical accuracy of the Bible is not the issue.  Whether you can accept this movie as an articulate portrayal of religious text is.  There are certainly better stories to be found in both the Old and New Testaments, but Gibson has made this one as good as it can be.  The film itself is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  The acting is magnificent and the costumes and settings perfect.  The only problem with the movie is that the story is not particularly compelling to this non-churchgoer.  Yet to Gibson's credit, he makes it at least interesting and emotionally charged.  All of this is a credit to a great director who has assembled a very fine group and made a very fine film.    If you doubt Gibson's intentions because you find him to be a religious nutjob, then I can only ask you to study a scene right at the end.  When Jesus finally succumbs and is dead in Mary's arms, she looks down at her son, understandably griefstricken.  You start to think that this is the part where Mel really sticks it to the \\"Christ-killers\\".  But no.  Mary looks up with an unforgettable look of resignation and sadness in her eyes.  It is not an angry look, but a look consistent with Christianity's most fundamental tenet-- forgiveness.  That is the image that lasts when the movie ends shortly thereafter, and as a result it is also the lesson that lasts.
B0000542DJ|1.0|As a movie, it's fine.  As history, it's absurd. <br /> <br />Based on one man's neurosis (albeit, hard to tell if that one man is Stone or Garrison), JFK purports to explain the \\"conspiracy\\" behind the Kennedy assassination.  If you choose to believe it, you delude yourself.  No good evidence exists that has not been explained logically in coherence with the single-assassin-Oswald theory.  Sadly, many more people will believe Stone's fraudulent tale than will ever consider investigating the details of the murder in a logical, un-hyped analysis. <br /> <br />Better not to see it at all.....
B0002IU988|3.0|While I was hoping for better (Creed use to impress me), this album isn't terribly bad.  Just not the depth and style I enjoyed on previous albums.  I know its not technically Creed, but it's practically the same band.  The singers voice is almost annoying at times, and the guitarist (while good..) tends to drown out the singer...  *shrugs* I guess my expectations were way too high for this record.
B000002LJW|3.0|I have given this album \\"only\\" three stars, partly because of the slick, glossy 80s production by Russ Titelman which has completely removed any hint of real grit from these songs. They might as well have been played using synthesizers (actually most of the drums aren't drums at all but a digital drum machine).    The songs themselves are generally pretty good, though. They are not as lean, nor as muscular, as they could have been, but \\"Pretending\\" is a fine, mid-tempo rocker with some really great vocals by Eric Clapton. \\"Bad Love\\" suffers from terrible, overblown production and weird synthesizers, but it's not a bad song in itself, and \\"Running On Faith\\" is a slow, bluesy ballad with relative lean instrumentation and some nice slide dobro playing.  \\"Hard Times\\" is another slow blues, augumented by a horn ensemble, and Clapton actually does a pretty good, funky rendition of \\"Hound Dog\\".  \\"Run So Far\\" is a little masterpiece, written by George Harrison, who lends a hand playing guitar and singing harmony vocals. Nice, sparse arrangement there.    Clapton wrote \\"Old Love\\" with Robert Cray, and it works pretty well, too, without too much of the wall-of-sound treatment which has partly ruined \\"No Alibis\\", \\"Breaking Point\\" and \\"Anything For Your Love\\". And the album ends on a high note with some real, three-dimentional drumming from Steve Ferrone and Jim Keltner on the fine ballad \\"Lead Me On\\" and Bo Diddley's fiery blues classic \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" (albeit in a slick, less fiery version).    All in all, \\"Journeyman\\" is a good album. It could've been great, if a few more songs had been good instead of merely adequate, and if the production had been less 80s-like, but it is not one to be avoided by any means.
B000268QB2|5.0|Best value for brilliant music.  A must buy for any discerning music listerner.
0425173755|2.0|This book just didn't do it for me and I believe it was because of the writing style, which can best be described as \\"no-frills.\\"  There was little to no description in this book, it used as few words as possible.  I needed more elaboration in order to see the scene, the characters, etc.  I also thought that the structure of the book was too \\"fill in the blank.\\"  By this I mean that the book lacked transitions and it was as if the various parts of the book were written independently of one another and then were strung together at the end. <br /> <br />
031218087X|2.0|Well, what did I expect from the author of the DaVinci Code? D.C. has been shot full of holes by numerous experts, so I shouldn't have expected much from this one. But it's far, far worse. Examples: <br /> <br />1. A man is shooting at one of the characters in the Seville, Spain airport terminal and no one notices/there is no security. Granted, it's in the middle of the night, but does he really believe we would be so dumb to think you could shoot someone, even break the revolving door with a bullet, and NO ONE would hear it or notice? Then, the next scene is the same character is driving a Vespa down the runway at the airport, pursued by the shooter. No one in the tower seems to notice.  <br /> <br />2. A virus is destroying the data banks at the Natl. Security Agency (a real govt. agency, BTW). So? Are we to think they don't back this stuff up at least daily?  <br /> <br />3. A \\"virus\\" causes the new super computer at NSA to overheat, catch fire and self-destruct. The virus was an effort by privacy advocates to destroy NSA's new code-cracking computer. Duh! They can always rebuild the machine, right! <br /> <br />4. The aforementioned computer is overheating, then on fire. What, their network doesn't beep their network administrator when it goes down, like yours does at work? When it catches fire, it doesn't trigger any fire alarms, no one comes running. It just burns up.  <br /> <br />This guy is not a well-researched author who thinks things through like even such hacks as John Grisham. I've read my last work by him.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Can it be?  OK--he was pretty good in Risky Business and I don't remember seeing him in Eyes Wide Shut but otherwise, Tom Cruise doesn't move me.  The phony smile, the clenched hands...I dunno.<br /><br />But everyone is good in Collateral.  (The hispanic guy who plays the drug lord is fabulous).  The plot has just enough originality, some realistic dialog and even a clever and almost plausible twist at the end.<br /><br />Although not very insightful the exchanges in the cab make it play like a play but with a movie ending.  Certainly not 5 stars but you could do far worse.  Maybe this is our reward for suffering through Vanilla Sky and Magnolia.<br /><br />Next Summer, I hope to see Jamie Foxx driving a bulletproof limo in Collateral II.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a great documentary as well as a film. It is highly accurate while it gives you a look at different aspects that Bush doesn't want you to know (i.e. taking a black magic marker and covering the name Baath). This film mad me laugh a lot. What made me laugh the most was how ridiculously President Bush is. If you are not sure on who to vote for this election, watch this film. A special feature that this DVD will have is the Condoleezza Rice 9/11 Commission testimony.
B000060P79|1.0|Before my musical tastes went off the deep end completely around September of 2002, I remember my friends playing this in his car when we were driving up to the mountains. <br />Now, pop punk is really a hit and miss thing.I LOVED Green Day as a young buck, and I could listen to Blink 182 and actually enjoy it. Then my roommate at the time got this CD I'm reviewing and kept playing it... <br />To say \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\" changed my outlook on music is severely inadequate to express my reaction to Simple Plan.  <br />Anyways, we were driving along and \\"I'd Do Anything\\" starts blaring through the 4x10\\". Normally, I'd hear my roommate start playing it and I'd put on my headphones and listen to something else. Simple Plan was really, just too simple of a plan for me to follow. But now it's thundering inside the car with the volume at 11 and I CANNOT ESCAPE IT. The album somewhat plays out... <br />Simple Plan had finally shown me how far \\"mainstream\\" music has devolved, even since 1997. Within the period of 5 years, we've gone from \\"OK Computer\\" to THIS. (I'm not slagging \\"OK Computer\\", it is THE best rock album of the 20th century to me). Maybe I am getting older, but I faintly  remember when even the clone bands actually had something going for them.  <br />I could go into how Green Day did this with more balls and skill more than a decade ago before they fell off the boat. I could go into how Blink 182 are a hundred times better than this at their laziest and greediest. I could go into how this is the weakest dillution of an already drastically weakened formula. I could say that not once did I even feel like I was being rocked. I could say that I wouldn't consider this CD fun EVER. Instead, I will say Simple Plan have finally made me respect hair metal. You can say that hair metal signifies some of the worst qualities in music and I would fullheartedly agree. I would then proceed to tell you that at least Vince Neil was snorting half his body weight incoke a month and Bret Michaels was banging half the females in Los Angeles WHILE probably doing his whole body weight in coke a night and they still kept going. Simple Plan just need to get their asses kicked by Northern Idaho skinhead punks.  <br />So after my encounter with Simple Plan that one September afternoon I proceeded to buy El-P's solo album \\"Fanastic Damage\\", Boards of Canada's \\"Geogaddi\\", and Godspeed You Black Emperor's \\"Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada\\". 3 completely different genres for sure, but any three of these CDs are lightyears beyond Simple Plan's comprehension. That's not saying much, as even Days of the New is probably beyond their comprehension anyways.  <br />So before I get REAL longwinded, maybe I should give Simple Plan credit in that their brand of music made me follow my own existing esoteric tastes even farther. But then I might as well say Pol Pot was an alright guy because he taught me communist regime inspired genocide was bad. There's no way in hell that's going to happen.

B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age. When I asked my friend what band was his favorite, he said those five words. I, being a rap fan, never heard of this band. As I slowly moved my interests to all of the music world, I came again to the Queens of the Stone Age by listening to \\"Go With The Flow.\\" This became one of my favorite songs and I simply had to buy the CD, \\"Songs for the Deaf.\\" Listening this tons and tons of times, on my way to class, on the train, in the room, I was shocked on how amazing these guys could be in creating music. I personally ranked it up there in my top 10 best CDs. This may seem like an over exaggeration, but I'm not kidding. This CD truly rocks.     The album is played like a radio show. At the beginning, there's a radio interlude that makes fun of the radio. Then the track explodes to \\"You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire.\\" Heavy guitar riffs and Nick Oliveri's voice at near screaming, this song pumps up your blood. However, I only liked the guitar riffs, as the screaming got tiring at the end of this short track. However, next was the famous \\"No One Knows\\" with crazy timing and awesome guitar solos, Josh Homme's haunting voice captures the attention of your ear. Well done song, and probably one of my favorites.     The CD then proceeds with a rapid Spanish DJ talk, then another good song \\"First It Giveth.\\" With acoustic melted in with the electric, this song has a Hispanic feel to it. Then \\"Song for the Dead.\\" which begins with a guitar riff and Dave Grohl banging on the drums. One of the most creative songs on this CD. A haunting and a gothic feel make this song a high point in the CD.      The CD then goes with a calm feel in the beginning of \\"The Sky is Fallin'.\\" Then it hits you with the guitar riffs. It's a long song, hitting over five minutes. Then a quick radio mock, then with the worst song on this CD.     \\"Six Shooter\\" is simply blown up guitar riffs and lots of screaming. Because of this completely pointless track, the CD has a Parental Advisory. It's short too, thank goodness, clocking only over one minute.      \\"Hangin Tree\\" is a song that starts with a quick bass part and then Mark Lanegan sings with some crazy guitar stuff. However, the song gets boring after a while.      This song deserves a whole new paragraph. \\"Go With The Flow\\" is one of high points in the bottom half of this CD. With some crazy drum work from Grohl and amazing vocals from Homme, this song is a big winner. Too bad its short, only slightly above three minutes.      Then another poppy song. \\"Gonna Leave You,\\" starts with a great riff then explodes in a great song with \\"oooh\\"s and \\"aaahh\\"s in the chorus that have a great effect.   The CD then goes into \\"Do It Again\\" with a unique riff and Homme's voice blends right into the song. It's a short song, but the radio interlude make it longer.      \\"God is in the Radio\\" is quite repetitive song, but after listening to it for a while, it grows on you. The fade out in the middle of the song and the comeback is kind of pointless though. A long song, clocking in at about six minutes.     \\"Another Love Song\\" is a decent song but the guitar riff gets boring after a while. The lyrics are quite creative though. It's a little too poppy though. The song acts like a lull before the storm. The storm being, of course, \\"Song for the Deaf\\"     This is THE song of the album. The album is named after this song, so it has to be good right? Wrong. It's great. You have to listen to it a few times to truly appreciate it. With a quick radio interlude before, the song starts with a bass riff that is haunting. The electric guitars explode with Homme's gothic voice soars over the guitars. The chorus is amazing, with dual guitars screaming with appropriate \\"aaahh\\"s. One of my favorite songs on this CD, it ends with a huge bang. But wait! It's not over yet.     \\"Mosquito Song\\" is a acoustic song that sounds happy, but if you observe the lyrics, its quite a haunting song. It has a hidden meanings tied in with the amazing guitar riff.      \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is not your average nu-metal album. Well, Queens of the Stone Age isn't your average nu-metal band. Each song is different from the normal radio song. You can tell, because the layout of the song and the amazing guitar riffs would never be heard on the radio, with the exception of \\"No One Knows\\" which has gotten lots of radio play (and also sounds totally different from any other song on the radio). Finally we have a band that takes pure rock and roll and adds their own twist to it, making an amazing album. Overall, a must buy. Its worth your ten bucks, trust me.
0783240236|2.0|It's both ironic and a tragedy that for so many non-film buffs the name Alfred Hitchcock is synonymous with the horror film genre: tragic and ironic because the assumption is false and not indicative of Hitchcock's body of work. Of all of his films, \\"The Birds\\" remains Hitchcock's only genuine foray into horror.  <br /> <br />Based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, the plot concerns the tiny hamlet of Bodega Bay, CA and an unlikely romance that gradually blossoms between a head-strong woman of the world, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) and a mild-mannered attorney, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). (Aside: Du Maurier's work had inspired Hitch' before. Her novel \\"Rebecca\\" had provided him with his foray into American movies and the resulting film won a Best Picture Oscar - though Hitch' would never be honored in his life time as such with a Best Director statuette.) <br />After a chance meeting in a bird shop in San Francisco, Melanie is determined to get under Mitch's skin by secretly delivering a pair of love birds to his family home in Bodega Bay. The birds are a surprise present for Mitch's young sister, Kathy (Veronica Cartwright). Upon discovering the gift, Mitch tails Melanie back to town to settle the score. However, before he can confront her on shore, a seagull attacks Melanie in her row boat, inflicting a head wound that is but a prelude of sinister things to come. Jessica Tandy costars as Mitch and Kathy's overbearing mother, Lydia. Skeptical of Melanie's past and quite aware of the burgeoning romance between her son and Melanie, Lydia is determined to keep the two apart. But that's where the story ends and the special effects begin. <br />  <br />\\"The Birds\\" is by far the most technically challenging film in Hitchcock's canon. It features complex matte shots, process photography, multi-layering of combined live action/pre-shot sequences and perilous stunt work performed by the principle actors with live birds. At one point during the shoot, the script called for Melanie to be trapped in an attic with birds swarming her from every direction. The experience sent Tippi Hedren into shock and resulted in her temporary hospitalization. During another sequence Hedren sustained minor injuries when a window that wasn't suppose to break suddenly shattered, sending shards of glass into Hedren's scalp and face. For the sequence in which birds begin to gather on some playground equipment while Melanie smokes a cigarette, Hitchcock had intended using live subjects. But the bird wranglers were unable to find enough feathered friends to behave. Ultimately, only a few well trained fowl were employed with a host of fake birds used in their stead. Despite these difficulties, the resulting film emerges as Hitchcock's final cinematic triumph; a terrifying blend of surreal fantasy and harrowing escapism. In the intervening decades the master of suspense declined into a string of B-pictures (Marnie, Topaz, Torn Curtain, Frenzy) that retread on his old formulas but with less and less success at the box office. <br /> <br />Universal's DVD is problematic. Though the picture is anamorphically enhanced there is an excessive amount of digital anomalies present throughout. At times these are so glaringly obvious that it is impossible to simply ignore the shimmering, edge enhancement and pixelization. Colors on the whole are bright and accurately rendered. During process shots and matte painting effects flesh tones tend to look a bit pasty. Age related artifacts have not been cleaned up and are present throughout. Contrast levels and fine detail are on the whole nicely realized though, at times, the picture does have a decidedly harsh look that is not very film like. The audio is mono but has been nicely cleaned up.  Extras include a very thorough and entertaining documentary on the making of the film, screen pages and storyboard ideas on how the film was supposed to end, as well as the original theatrical trailer. Please note: Universal's packaging that advertises an \\"alternate ending\\" is deceiving since no ending other than the one already featured in the film was ever shot. The \\"alternate\\" as advertised is a series of still images and storyboard ideas strung together for a final that that might have been but has never actually existed on celluloid.    <br />
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This Cd is a great metal cd probably their best.  Every song is great. it's a little different than the other 2 but change is good.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|It's time for Dubya to start the Cold War again. As much as I'm against anything he has or will ever do, if he were to announce we're bombing Russia into the stone age, I'd do my best salute. Hopefully these bombs he may drop would hit T.A.T.U. repeatedly. Repeatedly until nothing is left but the radioactive ashes.  <br />You really won't understand what I'm saying until you hear \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" at work 5 times a day. This is without a doubt the worst thing anyone has ever put onto a sheet of plastic. Whichever one of these two sings \\"They're not gonna get us\\" about 500,000 times is begging to have their vocal cords torn out by me in a fit of rage. Seriously, I am NOT joking when I say someone should literally be held accountable and DIE for that song.  <br />...and the rest of the stuff is pretty abysmal too. Did some cokehead make this album to pay off his debts? Who the hell basically makes a lesbian human version of the Chipmunks? On the fun scale, Around A Little Less Than 100mph In The Wrong Lane is somewhere in between being sodomized by a gray whale and papercutting between your fingers and toes.
B0002234LS|3.0|The dire results of plagiarism cannot get any worse in this taut thriller, adapted from a story by the modern master of terror, Stephen King. Johnny Depp's performance as an author of some renown, the cuckold husband in the midst of a sticky divorce, attempting to write again, is a smooth mixture of light comedy, witty one-liners and an experienced sense of the dramatic, rendered with unconscious precision. This popular American actor is at the top of his form because he makes it look so easy.<br /><br />When this picture first hit the big screen, practitioner-critics from around the world agreed that it had the potential to be a very good film, but settled for something much less. The problem, they believed, was an identity problem: it couldn't decide whether to be a dramatic comedy or a serious thriller - it attempted to achieve both and failed on all counts. It was said as well that Depp is the film's only saving grace, and without his name and talent, its box office run should not have lasted more than a few days. I couldn't disagree more. Depp's performance certainly carried the film along, but the overall editing, creative and tight, and the soundtrack by Phillip Glass, reminiscent of old Hitchcock films, provided enough atmospheric suspense to ensure the audience remained riveted from start to finish.<br /><br />Secret Window did not set out to be original, reach any box office records or change the face of filmmaking. It is simply a good story, adapted to the screen for the single purpose to entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously nor did the filmmaker's intend it to be taken as such. Depp appeared to have a good time making the film and a lot of us had a good time watching it, too. Well worth the time and few bucks.
B00000AFHM|4.0|Belle & Sebastian is something magical, so magical and amazing that at first glance they seem like nothing.  It takes a while to sink in, and in that time their music tends to confuse you, for you've never heard something like this before.  But after time, Belle & Sebastian will earn a spot in your heart as one of the most pleasant songcrafters you will ever hear. <br /> <br />The Boy With The Arab Strap is an incredible piece of work by Belle & Sebastian.  The entire album stays majestical and gives you an ultimate sense of relaxation, but very strangely sneaks brass instruments in, without you even realizing how loud and out of place the trumpets can be at times.  Stuart Murdoch's vocals are (as the music backing it) soothing, and stay fluent as he pumps out fairy-tale lyrics.   <br /> <br />'It Could Have Been A Brilliant Career' starts the album off, very slowly.  It sets the stage up for 'Sleep The Clock Around', a track which no one can put down.  It starts soft, but includes sharp trumpets.  'Is It Wicked Not To Care' has female vocals, followed by 'Ease Your Feet In The Sea', which really does give you the 'beach' mindpicture.  The album stays pretty consistant, stopping for the spoken-voice over instrumentals interlude 'A Space Boy Dream'.  The album ends on a soft, yet high note with 'The Rollercoaster Ride'. <br /> <br />I really don't have too many things bad to say about this album.  If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.  Get this album.
079073804X|4.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" is the film that turned heads (literally) and stomachs (it's rumored that some patrons at the premiere threw up - studio P.R. or factoid info, we may never know). It stars Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil, a single mother raising her pre-teen daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) in a Bostonian brownstone that just might be the new hot spot for satanic worship. When the devil decides to claim Regan for his own through demonic possession he unleashes a maelstrom of otherworldly activity in which Regan becomes the human vessel for his return to the earth. Enter Fathers Lankester Marrin (Max Von Sydow) and Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Marrin is a devout Catholic. Karras has lost his faith. Together these two priests set themselves on a path to abolish Satin by restoring Regan's virtue to her mother. Lee J. Cobb is William Kinderman, a suspicious police lieutenant who gradually begins to suspect the unthinkable is taking place at the MacNeil's. Based on the bone chilling novel by William Blatty and directed with formidable gusto by William Friedkin, \\"The Exorcist\\" continues to test the faith of film goers in search of a good scare.   <br />Previously Warner Home Video has made \\"The Exorcist\\" available in three separate editions. There's the bare bones - movie only - edition and the 25th anniversary edition (both minted from the same film elements) and, \\"the version you've never seen\\" (reportedly minted from improved picture and sound elements. None of these options presents the film in a completely satisfying edition, though the 25th anniversary disc comes close. As already mentioned, both the 25th and the original film only disc are minted from the same print. Image quality exhibits considerable grain in spots, can be remarkably smooth in spots, and exhibits a dated visual characteristic. Colors are sometimes bold, though quite often less than, with weak flesh tones that are either a pasty pink or hazy orange. Contrast levels are sometimes quite good while blacklevels are rarely deep or solid. There is some pixelization and edge enhancement present for a visual presentation that is not terribly smooth or consistent.  <br />However, the 25th anniversary edition contains a BBC documentary on the film, the inspiration for the novel, and, a thoroughly engrossing back story on exorcisms. This documentary is, unfortunately, NOT available on \\"the version you've never seen before,\\" presumably because Warner's rights have since expired. \\"The version you've never seen before\\" does exhibit improvements on all levels of picture quality but they are very marginal improvements at best! Also, several scenes excised before the film's original theatrical release have been reinstated herein, including the much talked about `spider walk' episode in which Regan, possessed by the devil, walks upside down and backwards down a flight of stairs. Truthfully, there's nothing terribly exciting about the new footage that enhances your viewing pleasure.  Minus the documentary, I recommend the 25th anniversary edition over \\"the version you've never seen before.\\" The audio on all versions of the film has been cleaned up and restored.   <br />
B000002KCC|5.0|A far cry from the polished efforts of \\"Harvest\\" or \\"After the Gold Rush,\\" \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is a brilliant, harrowing album, documenting a second friend's death due to drug addiction.  This is second in a trilogy which began with the now unavailable \\"Time Fades Away,\\" and would finish with \\"On the Beach.\\"  This is difficult to see because this album was released shortly after \\"On the Beach.\\"  With \\"Time Fades Away,\\" writted mostly for the same person as \\"The Needle and the Damage Done,\\" Neil Young begins his descent into darkness and depression, for his friends, his own life and fame, and the American Dream of the 70s.  That continues through \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" the darkest album of his career, and Neil resurfaces on \\"On the Beach,\\" and is back to his old self by \\"Zuma.\\"  But in the mean time, \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is dark, twisting, and emotional, with Young barely able to sing or play, and the songs sprawling on and on.  Unnapreciated on initial release, the album has since earned a respected and well deserved place in popular music.  It is truly brilliant.
B00003CXXS|4.0|The film opens with a return to Isla Sorna. A man and a boy are soaring behind a boat; then something happens to their tow boat. An ominous beginning, like with the first \\"Jaws\\". Professor Grant says he will never return to Isla Sorna. But a wealthy businessman shows up with a blank check. And so we return again to a very scary story. Again, the best laid plan of man fails due to an unforeseen event. When will they ever learn? <br /> <br />The film quickly gets up to speed and action. The computer generated images are better than in the first \\"Jurassic Park\\". The chatter among the survivors is better too. Having a cadaver pop up for horror recalls \\"Indiana Jones\\". [Does this kill off people's appetite for snacks?] Why do these people travel to a dangerous place unarmed? Is this film meant as a warning against cloning and genetic modifications? <br /> <br />By half-time the film tells of the survivors journey to the coast to escape. This film assumes there would be no monsters in the sea. But guess what they find up in the air? Of course, they manage to find a boat to take them down river to the coast. A last attack by a monster is averted with a flare gun (again recalling \\"Jaws\\"). Then they are saved when the Marines land! <br /> <br />Tea Leoni shines like a star in this film. The fewer number of actors suggest a lower budget, compared to the original film. The conventions are followed in showing what happens to a man who steals. [But would that nest be uncovered? Not for alligators.] It seems unrealistic for a cell phone to be working after it passed through the digestion system. <br /> <br /> <br />
0071373586|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot, lots of terrific ideas on ways to position and to grow your business
B00005Y7AW|5.0|For the first time in a long time we have the opportunity to enjoy a singer-songwriter of great and lasting talent.  Musically, Rufus Wainright draws from many traditions including Tin-Pan Alley, Pop, Musicals, Folk, and I am sure there will be more genres that he will explore.  I think he is much more akin to a Joni Mitchell than a Randy Newman (actually, kind of an insulting comparison, in my opinion).  His lyrics are clever and sensitive, and are not quite as offhand as they may first appear.  They are importantly tied to his musical phrasing, as well - much more like Joni Mitchell compositions.  To be sure, he is his own musician, and stands strongly on his own two feet.  It is a bonus that we are given the gift of a major talent, who is gay and proud of it, but that his raison d'etre is not being a gay man, but being a great artist. <br /> <br />Buy POSES.  It is a remarkable achievement.
B00024BHTC|5.0|What an album? Nightwish seems to suprise their fans and even outsiders all the time; they sure suprised me! Their detication to spontaneously over-power the listener is enforced even more every album they compose. Tarja, in my opinion, is one of the great vocalists of our time. She is so expressive and pure; her rapturous voice travels into the listener's body and put's he or she into a state of shock and awe. The remaining members of Nightwish are at an adequate level of talent when it comes to true musicianship. Tarja is the spotlight of this band. Though Nightwish's composition relies on somewhat simple writing, they continue to structure their music to perfection; which is what true music is all about. Once is an excellent album; any person who is open and not narrow-minded should give this album a try! Fans will be amazed when they realize the collision of these two different genres. Nightwish is not the first band to insert classical melodies and operatic vocals into heavy metal music; although, they, in my opinion, have created a great representation of operatic metal and are becoming the premiere operatic metal band world-wide! Also check out Nightwish's other great masterpieces; they are as perfect as the pristine angels of heaven!
B000089RVX|5.0|At last, a great rock band fronted with a talent and incredible female vocalist. The opening song will leave the listener wondering where did this young woman come from, and what took so long for her to get signed? Not only is Amy Lee the most beauiful woman to be an amazing rocker, but by far, one of the most talentest. If it were not for her, this would be just another typical rock bamd, but she makes or will break the band. Catch the awesome tracks of 1 to the end, my personal favorite is My Last Breath and I will be very disappointed if it does not make it as a single. Look for her amazing performance on The Punisher Soundtrack with the track; Broken, as I said before, she made or would have broken that single as a hit.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I think that \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"  was a great movie.  I have read all of the books three times, and I think the new director did a great job.  I was not disappointed at all.  I mean, compared to the books, none of the movies are any good, but the books were amazing and the movie was great.  All of the people who didn't like it are crazy.  I would definately spend my money on this one. :D
B000000OAL|4.0|Queens first album was quite a bit different then thier usual 70s material. Freddie Mercury only plays piano on a few songs and the album is more harder edged, aggressive and less poppy then the albums to come. That might explain why it did not do so well when it was first released but this album does properly introduce a Prog Rock sensiblility (always with the band) in Great King Rat and My Fairy Queen and hosts arguably Queens first instrumental Seven Seas Of Rhye later rerecorded with lyrics.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was so happy when this cd came out, and i was not dissapointed with it.  This is a perfect cd, every song is great. <br /> <br />Compared to mer de noms, the songs sound better rounded and maybe a little more \\"poppy\\".  But that's defenitely not a bad thing.  There isnt such a feeling of intellectual-ness as mer de noms. <br /> <br />The main problem that was fixed frm mer de noms, is the album starts feeling slightly repetative during the last few tracks. <br /> <br />Im very happy with thirteenth step, maynard will continue to amaze me with tunes ive never heard before.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I heard bad things about this album, and none of them have made since to me. Linkin Park has released the best follow up album and their best album, and yet people say it is not as good as their first, I highly disagree and am a huge fan of their first record. The album include hit singles; Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Faint, Figure .09, Breaking the Habbit, and Numb so crank your player to the top.
B00005JN0A|3.0|While nothing original, Europtrip is a fun and entertaining movie. It's the standard gross-out teen comedy ala American Pie and Road Trip, but it's set in Europe. In fact, the original script was called Ugly Americans, but it was later changed so fans of Road Trip would find similarities in both titles and  want to see this. That pretty much sums it all up. If you're a fan of those two films, you will be a fan of Eurotrip. If not, steer clear.
B000000OAC|4.0|3 1/2 stars. In the late 70s Prog Rock was on the way out replaced by disco, Punk, Party Funk, Corporate Rock and generally more poppish music (the following year would see the beggining of the New Wave/New Romantic movement further distilling Art Rock) and so like many other prog rock groups like Yes, Gentle Giant and to a certain extent Genesis, Queen moved on to a more simpler and accessible rock sound embracing the simpler times. NOTW featured shorter compositions stripping away the bombast of Queens past efforts hugely (though Queen were already becoming more straight forward with A Day At The Races). Still this is definatly a strong album, theres actually a wide variety of styles here from punk to jazz and its still very much Queen.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's 4th studio record, ...And Justice for All, definatly deserves the attention the previous Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning recieved. I will not rate the tracks becuase my opinion matters to no one. Buy this album if you are man enough. (...) Listen to real music about earth dying and people dying like a man.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Billy Joe heads this hard to resist rock/pop band with another hit album and by far the best. All of the tracks are hits and needed to be cranked. The record even has the amazing track; Misery which tells a story of huge porportions and is beyond me why it never made it as a hit. There's also the hilarious track; Deadbeat Holiday which is perfect to explain the teenage life, parents listen that track it'll help you figure out your kid's life. Tracks; Church On Sunday, Fashion Victim, Hold On, Waiting, Minority, and Macy Day's Parade are what make this album on of the best year. I hope you also enjoy my favorite track; Castaway and leaves you as a fan.
B00005JNEI|1.0|More lies, half-truths, and distortions from dysnfunctional, delusional sleazebag Michael Moore, and the gullible fools like the \\"Amazon.com reviewer\\" and most of the people (if that's the word for them) posting at these boards lap it up like mindless doggies. It's positively frightening to know that people like you actually get to vote, and will do it believing what Moore says about President Bush is true. If John Kerry, i.e. The Mortician, is elected, this country will look back on the Jimmy Carter era with nostalgia. You're a bunch of damn zombies. If Bush were the man Moore portrays in this amateurish piece of filth, Moore would have been shipped off to Bagdhad where he'd be beheaded. Then again, why behead a man whose head is useless, anyway.
B000000OE7|5.0|Made In Heaven Queens last album is also thier most poppish. Theres very few aggressive songs here instead the album consists mainly of sweeping etherial ballads with keyboard florishes highlighted by Freddie Mercurys operatic vocals and general return to the piano after many Queen albums closing out with the longest Queen Instumental A Beutifull Day Reprise running some 21 minutes. The albums quite excellent. Queen ended thier career well nad intrestingly by making an album that was the exact opposite of thier hard rocking debut.
B000001ELB|2.0|With the release of digital remasters, Paul called this one a 'hatchet job'.... and rightly so. The songs are great, except for the Strutter '78 because of the disco type drumming (c'mon, this is supposed to be a hard rock classic)... but the sound is trash, esp. noticible on Deuce, 100,000 Years, and Love Gun.... for being digitally remastered, it's really muffled, badly.... Unless you're a hardcore KISS fan (is there any other type of KISS fan?), save your money and give this one a WIDE berth.
B000002HRE|3.0|Not much to say about this album, except that it could have been better. I just got this album and it's okay, but that's only because of the hit tracks; Fuel, The Memory Remains, and The Unforgiven II, no other reason. The album is very repetitive and way too long to listen to. The only reason why I finally got this album was because of Avril Lavine's version of Fuel and that song got me hooked. I had heard The Memory Remains and it was enjoyable, but I had no idead that it was by Metallica. They have never really appealed to me and I will only get two more of their albums.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots got absolutely ripped apart by the press and rock fans after the release of their debut album Core for being facsimiles fo their grunge peers; I will admit that some of it was warranted, but it was as good a debut in rick as their has been in recent years. Obviously the criticism must have hurt; enter their second kick in the teeth, Purple. This was a turning point in STP's career, considering this album was relased two months after the death of grunge's poster boy, Kurt Cobain, and the musicial \\"trend\\" would soon follow him to the grave. Scott Weiland and Co. were obviously on a mission, taking what they had learned and listening to what was around them;listen to \\"Vasoline\\" and you'll hear a hint of Red Hot Chili Peppers funk, carried by the bass of Robert DeLeo. Then there's \\" Interstate Love Song\\", which in my opinion is just out of the top ten of the best hard rock songs of the 90's. They have taken the metallic element of their music,and replaced with catchy folk rock with pop appeal; if you haer any alternative bands that try to get hardcore(Incubus, Switchfoot,Lost Prophets,Chevelle, etc,), they can thank STP(and the Smashing Pumpkins, for that matter). <br />
B000000OAA|5.0|Maixing the best qualities of Queens usual mid 70s mix if straightforward Rock (Misfire, Killer Queen, Now Im Here, Tenement Funster) and Prog Rock (Lily Of The Valley, In The Lap Of The Gods, Brighten Rock) Sheer Heart Attack is a powerfull testiment of Queens greatness.
0792838084|3.0|Believe it or not, this was David Lynch's comeback vehicle from the \\"Dune\\" debacle that almost bankrupted Dino De Laurentis and lost major bucks at the BO. This movie did MUCH better. Why is this so hard to believe?<br /><br />Well, remember those guys you used to see in every sizeable town who would ride around in old Chevys or Buicks, six or seven full, bent on raising hell? Well, this story is about one callow young fellow's brush with people like that as he pursues the spoor of a mystery that he himself discovered.<br /><br />Jeffrey Beaumont, played by Kyle MacLachlan, after visiting his ailing father in the hospital, finds a severed ear in a vacant lot and promptly takes it to the chief of police. The chief of police adds to the mystery by telling him to stay out of it and let the police handle the case, so naturally, Jeffrey can't keep away from the whole thing and does his own investigating.<br /><br />To complicate matters, the DAUGHTER of the chief, (Laura Dern,) befriends him and gives him leads as to who may be connected to the severed ear...whether it's part of a homicide or some gruesome torture method. While investigating all this, Jeffrey manages to meet the woman the chief's daughter implicated as a possible accessory to the mystery. He does this by hiding in her closet after masquerading as an exterminator and taking her keys earlier in the day. The woman, Dorothy Valens, is played by Isabella Rossellini, NOT playing the kind of part she usually plays, though her basic innocence still comes through in this smarmy role. Anyway, this is how Jeffrey finds out about Frank Booth, perhaps the SICKEST movie villain you've seen since Clarence from \\"Robocop\\"!<br /><br />Frank, as it turns out, is connected with the crawling, insidious underworld in little Lumberton, where this all takes place. Jeffrey, late teen jerk that he is, actually FALLS for the Valens character and ends up being her paramour....and....well, it gets REALLY convoluted from here, and to relinquish more might spoil it for you, but suffice it to say, as I mentioned earlier, that about half the cast of \\"Dune\\" is in this movie, (MacLachlan, Jack Nance, Brad Dourif and Dean Stockwell,) and, with the exception of MacLachlan, they play pretty grisly villains, just like in Dune.<br /><br />Foul language reigns in this movie the minute Frank, (Dennis Hopper,) comes into the picture and doesn't stop. Frank's malevolence is palpable, because you KNOW you know somebody like this somewhere, and no matter what, they're STILL unbelievable.<br /><br />This movie makes \\"Subway\\", a movie I recently reviewed, look like Mother Carey's Chickens...David Lynch is one TRULY strange person to have directed this. The air of sadism is unreal, and the view of small town corruption is truly disturbing.<br /><br />We all know there are small towns like this in America, but you  STILL have to wonder what motivated him....it for you, but suffice it to say, as I mentioned earlier, that about half the cast of \\"Dune\\" is in this movie, (MacLachlan, Jack Nance, Brad Dourif and Dean Stockwell,) and, with the exception of MacLachlan, they play pretty grisly villains, just like in Dune.

B00004TBWR|5.0|Willy And The Poor Boys(1969). Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fourth Album.<br /><br />Much like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival was capable of shelling out an album every few months and enjoying immense commercial and critical success. With three multi-platinum albums behind them, Creedence Clearwater Revival released 'Willy And The Poor Boys'. In late 1969, 'Willy And The Poor Boys' hit #1 on the Albums Chart and the resulting singles, \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Down On The Corner\\" became huge hits for the band. As always, CCR's careful blend of Blues, Folk, Country, 50's Rock, and Classic Rock helped the band became sensations in all kinds of music, and led by Fogerty's gravelly anti-pop vocals and wailing guitar, it's no surprise the band has gone down as legends. So, is 'Willy And The Poor Boys' another solid release from Creedence Clearwater Revival, or a career misstep? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Down On The Corner- A big hit, \\"Down On The Corner\\" is a fun rocker that blends a catchy bassline with a Country/Rock beat. It's unlikely you won't be humming this to yourself!<br /><br />It Came Out Of The Sky- You'd think this is Elvis or Buddy Holly, but you'd be wrong. CCR takes a stab at 50's rock, and with Fogerty's energetic guitar riff and humorous lyrics, you can't help but like it!<br /><br />Cotton Fields- It's hard to believe these guys were from California! CCR blends an interesting mix of Country, Folk, and down-home Southern Rock to create a catchy little number.<br /><br />Poorboy Shuffle- A harmonica instrumental. While it may just be filler, at least it's interesting.<br /><br />Feelin' Blue- Much like a song you'd come to expect from B.B. King or Eric Clapton, CCR dishes out a bluesy rocker, and with Fogerty's addictive guitar melody and vocals, it's no surprise this is another winner. \\"Feelin' Blu-who-who-blue\\"!<br /><br />Fortuneate Son- A direct protest against the Vietnam War, \\"Fortunate Son\\" spoke to millions after it became a huge hit. CCR adds a shaper edge to the song, and Fogerty's angry vocals remind me of heavier acts like Lynyrd Skynyrd or pre-Stevie Nicks Fleetwood Mac. It's no wonder this song became a huge hit....it rules!<br /><br />Don't Look Now-  Much like Bob Dylan, CCR blends Folk and Rock on \\"Don't Look Now\\", although it seems a little generic along with the other tracks. Not bad, just average.<br /><br />The Midnight Special- Much slower and considerably quiter than most of CCR's music, \\"The Midnight Special\\" is still an energetic Blues-Rock song fulled to the brim with catchy vocals and guitarwork. A good song, just a little slower than most of CCR's stuff, although I wouldn't call this a \\"ballad\\".<br /><br />Side O' The Road- A guitar driven, Fogerty produced instrumental. Need I say more? Fogerty shows why he's one of the 60's best guitarist, ranking right up there with Clapton and Hendrix. In case you didn't know, Creedence Clearwater Revival does have a few Progressive Rock songs on each album, and these last two songs fit the bill.<br /><br />Effigy- 'Willy And The Poor Boy's longest track, \\"Effigy\\" is almost twice as long as every track. Much like the Doors or Iron Butterfly, \\"Effigy\\" is a casual mix of Psychadelic Folk Rock, mixed with Progressive elements and excellent musicianship. Fogerty + guitar = bliss!<br /><br />Overall, 'Willy And The Poor Boys' is another winner from Creedence Clearwater Revival, one of the few bands from the Late 60's-Early 70's that I actually enjoy! Blending the catchy pop hooks of the Beatles and the instrumental talent of Cream, not to mention various influences from 50's Rock and Progressive Rock, CCR never fails to deliver! If you won't good, clean, fun, addictive, and enjoyable classic rock, look no further!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- \\"Down On The Corner\\", \\"Fortunate Son\\", \\"Side O' The Road\\", and \\"Effigy\\".<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF CLASSIC ROCK, BLUES, FOLK, AND CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL!

B0001Z52RU|4.0|The Chaos Theory states that something as simple was the flutter of a butterfly's wings can cause world altering ripple effects.  Ashton Kutcher is not so much a time traveler as he is a changer of realities.<br /><br />The first fifteen minutes or so of this film are difficult to watch.  As a child, Kutcher is the victim of sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse, you name it.  You would swear that his girlfriend's brother is the devil himself.<br /><br />As Kutcher grows, he finds he is able to change realities by reading his journals and starting over in his life with foreknowledge from that point on.  Unfortunately, each time he attempts to better his reality his situation, and the world of those around him, worsens.  He goes from a beautiful life with his girl, to prison, to losing his hands, to a psych ward, etc.  All of these things he does to protect the girl he loves.<br /><br />It isn't until he realizes that he has to give up the girl and his love for her that all is right with his world and the world of everyone around him.<br /><br />Due to the excessive violence and cruelty loaded in the beginning of the film, and then sprinkled throughout, the BUTTERFLY EFFECT is difficult to watch.<br /><br />Somehow, its last few minutes redeems it in a small measure.  Just not completely.  In the end, it makes the viewer consider the consequences of individual choices made throughout life.
B000000OAH|3.0|Jazz is more or less a carbon copy of News Of The World combining a variety of styles and sounds in a Pop/Arena/AOR/MOR Rock general mode but its not quite as good. Jealousy, In Only Seven Days and Leaving Home aint Easy stretch very close to Barry Manilow in terms of light 70s pop and Fun It is a forgettable dance/disco number perhaps one of Roger Taylors weakest songs. The very title of the album seems strange. This is Queens weakest album of the 70s.
B00008EY65|5.0|The movie is solid, the bonus disc is wall-to-wall.  Probably the best cult-comic adaptation since \\"The Crow,\\" \\"Hellboy\\" takes the loner anti-hero role, packages it into a actor waiting for this sort of role his whole career, and puts around him a story and a cast that respects the material.  Perhaps it's time we had a new adage; it's not the actors, but the respect that counts.<br /><br />I must confess though, I'm a Hellboy poser.  I never read the comic, never heard of Mike Mignola, and now that I've seen the film, I want to be familiar.  I can't talk about how the film translates from graphic medium to that of the screen, I can only review based on my viewing.<br /><br />Early on I heard that Vin Diesel was being tapped to play Hellboy, but now that I've seen the film, Ron Pearlman seems the only natural choice, and therein lies the secret of a \\"good\\" performance, when an actor inhibits a role to the point where you go, \\"No one else could have played this character.\\"  Pearlman does a top-notch job of joining Hellboy's blue-collar demeanor with the responsibility Hellboy feels comes with being Hellboy.  He's mastered the physical side of Hellboy as well, even under all that plastic.  The walk, the gestures, the face, the lilt in the voice, the pauses... all genuine.<br /><br />Del Toro managed to secure John Hurt for a role as Hellboy's father-figure, Dr. Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm.  Broom is aging, dying in fact, but he won't tell Hellboy, or anyone.  His lifetime of work has solidified his sense of accomplishment, and the fact that he's fading shouldn't faze those around him, not even him.  When the time comes to die, he steps into the moment with assuredness.  Hellboy would've been proud.<br /><br />Selma Blair is Liz Sherman, a pyrokenetic with a tendency to make the room burst into flames.  She's trying to control it, of course, and would rather find herself in an uncomfortable setting where she can try to exert control, rather than be in familiar places with no counsel or assistance.  This is the love-interest character, believe it or not.  She's not blonde, she's not pure (well maybe in the darker sense of the word), but she is understanding.  She knows where Hellboy is coming from all too well, and he only wants her near.  They wind up together, and the final scene only makes it seem natural they should wind up together (here's a hint, Hellboy is flame-retardant).<br /><br />Rupert Evans is, for lack of a better word, a tour-guide through this menagerie.  His job is to basically look wide-eyed and nice, mill about and ask a lot of question that lead to plot-points and character development.  Some people call this a \\"lead role.\\"  I call it a \\"tour-guide.\\"<br /><br />There's a huge risk here for the whole movie to crash in on itself, get tedious and tiresome, and fizzle out during the climactic battle.  However, the actors, director, writers, film crew, everyone, respect the script and the story.  Basically, Hellboy is a demon from hell, raised by Dr. Broom to fight evil-monsters.  There's a main plot-thread involving Nazi's (the ready-made historic villains) and Rasputin, and an attempt to bring about Apocalypse.  Hellboy plays a key role in this, there's a choice to be made.  The line \\"Hell holds no surprises for us\\" is offered.  It holds together, and you can watch it over and over.<br /><br />The centerpiece to the bonus disc is a 2-1/2 hour documentary on the making of the film.  Brilliant.  There's no stupid voice-over work to tell you what to think, and there's plenty more for Hellboy-freaks to sift through.  Definitely one for the collection.aces with no counsel or assistance.

B00003CY0V|1.0|SWORDFISH is one of the worst films of recent memory. A cyberheist movie with an overly convoluted and meandering plotline and a few disinteresting hyperpryrotechnic set pieces, this adds yet another project to the list of recent Travolta stinkers.<br /><br />Travolta plays Gabriel, an arrogant self-appointed vigilante who resorts to thieving and the murder of innocents to finance his antiterrorist schemes. Halle Berry is his accomplice. She manages to entice Hugh Jackman, who plays the world's greatest hacker, into working for them by baring her breasts. Jackman's adolescent spastic, drooling reaction is indicative of the maturity level of this film. Not much else can be said. This picture is strictly a throwaway, and the producers should have followed their instincts.<br /><br />As one of the characters says, referencing DOG DAY AFTERNOON, \\"It's a morality play. The bad guys can't win.\\" In SWORDFISH the audience can't win. It's eminently unwatchable.
1592400876|2.0|The first few pages were entertaining, but the book quickly becomes repetitious.  The book takes on a whining tone as the author complains over and over again about people who don't know how to use an apostrophe correctly. If you're looking for an entertaining book on grammar, \\"The Elephants of Style\\" by Bill Walsh is much better.
B000000OA6|5.0|Openning with the long Prog Rock title track and featuring the main Queen trademarks vocal and guitar harmonies Innuendo is an awesome album showcasing the band in fine form.
B000000JO3|4.0|this cd is good for the $12 i payed for it but i wont call it a classic but im still sayin its a great cd
B000055X3U|5.0|Anathema, and this album in particular, were recommended to me in a random conversation in a chatroom about a month ago.  I was told, based on my muscial tastes, that this was an album I simply had to own and that it \\"even brings metalheads to tears.\\"  This I had to see.  I ordered the CD that night and got it in the mail a few days later.  I have to confess that my resistance to the idea of an album that could make metalheads weep like sissies probably contributed to my relative indifference to this CD at first.  While I thought the melodies and overall musicianship were good for a nice mellow drive in the mountains, I have to say that there was nothing on this album that would make me sob like a girl.<br /><br />I own over 800 CD's from all different genres.  I've come to a point where I rarely pay attention to the lyrics in a song unless it's really catchy.  Such was the case with Judgement.  Nothing had really caught my ear.  About a week after buying \\"Judgement,\\" I was driving home from work when \\"One Last Goodbye\\" played. I felt a little spark.  By the end of \\"Parisienne Moonlight,\\" I had to pull over.  For one reason or another, I'd actually listened to the lyrics, and it brought back a flood of memories.  Every girl I'd ever loved and lost, every girl I'd loved and never told.  All the things I should have said or done came flooding back like a maelstrom of pain and sorrow. No song or album has ever done that.<br /><br />Since then, I've paid more attention to the album in its entirety.  While I still think the aforementioned tracks are still my favorites, the emotional depth and impact of this album is undeniable.  This is music with which everyone on earth can identify.  The mood each song sets, the feelings described in the lyrics, and the emotions ellicited by the album overall are universal and undeniable; we've all felt them.  I don't think it matters what genre of music you like.  It would be a mistake not to check out this album.
B00016POFE|5.0|Wonderfully recorded.  Great to demo your hifi system.  Artwork is also jaw-dropping.  The music is pretty good too ;).
B000000OAN|5.0|After Sheer Heart Attack ANATO found Queen once again alternating flaulessly between Prog Rock (39, the 8 minute The Prophets Song, the instrumental God Save The Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody), Pop (Your My Best friend, Seaside Rondevous, Laxing On A Sunday Afternoon, Good Company and Love Of My Life) and Hard Rock (Death On Two Legs, Im In Love With My Car and Sweet Lady. The band proove once again how talented they are. Brian plays a whole host of string instruments, Freddie does some awesome choir work, John plays the electric Piano (the first instance of an electric keyboard on a Queen album though synths were still 4 years away) and Roger provides a wide range of percussion and drums up a storm.
B000268QB2|5.0|Perhaps the biggest band in the UK of this year are Keane. You could say the title belongs to Snow Patrol, Scissor Sisters or Franz Ferdinand, but I think it has to be Keane. They were first dubbed the new Coldplay - not only because they were spotted by the same small record label as Chris Martin's gang, but because their sound was similar. There's a big difference between Coldplay and Keane, however, and that is that Keane don't use guitars to make brilliant and emotional rock, they use the piano as their base instrument. It is ever-present throughout this entire album, and results in a successful stab at setting out what it intends to achieve. Countless bands have tried and failed in the past, but Keane have scored with this stunning debut album.<br /><br />Lead singer Tom Chaplin is on vocals, whilst Richard Hughes on drums and Time Rice-Oxley on piano, keyboard and bass accompany him in making this powerful music that has gripped Britain like a vice all year. Chaplin's vocals are soft and delicate and have been compared to those of Coldplay's frontman. I suppose there are slight similarities, but I like to think Chaplin resembles Radiohead's Thom Yorke more than anything. Many are saying Keane are better than Coldplay already. I believe this to be untrue. Coldplay are at the top of their game, whilst after only one album Keane are being hailed as geniuses. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here - they still have to prove themselves on the next album...<br /><br />Keane's debut album \\"Hopes And Fears\\" was released in May 2004 and went straight in at No.1 in the UK, and has since gone almost triple-platinum. Lead single \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" opens up the album in fine form. This is the band's trademark ballad that crashed into the charts at No.3 back in January 2004. The song has everything that you can expect from this album - grand vocals, sweeping drums and a Coldplay/Yellow-like pace to it. \\"Bend And Break\\" is an uptempo song which has soft and floaty vocals that sail along, held up by a bright piano break. The chorus is brilliant and very memorable. \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" is a slow and moving ballad that has a great composition to it which enables you to sing along, especially after it properly kicks in once the first 60 seconds are up. \\"Everybody's Changing\\" was the second single to be lifted from the album just before the album was released. Anyone who was unsure whether to buy the album after hearing only the first song was surely certain that this was an essential purchase after hearing this song. It's an upbeat number with brilliant drums and a wicked piano. I loved it from the first time I heard it - everyone's heard it - and I can imagine radio playing this for years to come.<br /><br />\\"Your Eyes Open\\" opens curiously and quietly, before the piano breaks out and Chaplin starts singing. The verses aren't very memorable, but the chorus is just soaring and really makes this an album highlight, with immense single-potential. \\"She Has No Time\\" is a slow and moving ballad and one of the album's best on offer, because along with the chilled and laid-back piano we have access to Chaplin's emotional vocals that are particularly high here. \\"Can't Stop Now\\" is a very happy and jaunty kind of song which tells the story of not being able to help someone in need because you have troubles of your own. It's a great song and the piano is ever-present. \\"Sunshine\\" is a rather strange song, yet I can't seem to stop listening to it. It has a rather eerie tone to it to start off with, but the way Chaplin harmonises his vocals in the chorus when singing \\"Can anybody find their home?\\" is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />\\"This Is The Last Time\\" is another fantastic song that unfortunately has a poor intro. I'm not too keen on the way it starts off, but as the song builds to its chorus, you find yourself in safe hands as Chaplin cradles your ears with his melodic arrangement and pleasant vocals. At this point, you begin to get scared in thinking that this could be an album that has no flaws at all! Most albums don't achieve that, and this unfortunately is another one. \\"On A Day Like Today\\" is up next, and not my cup of tea at all. I don't know what went wrong, but this is the worst song on the album and is better best forgotten! Luckily things pick up with the oddly titled \\"Untitled 1\\" next, which is a five and a half minute masterpiece with almost a dance beat to kick things off! The song soon picks up even more pace and you soon begin to realise that this song doesn't have a proper title because the focus isn't on the words, but on the instruments. \\"Bedshaped\\" closes the album as the final track, and boy what a song it is! As the third single to be released from the album, this is perhaps Keane's finest moment. With that beautiful piano and breathtaking vocals from Chaplin, the band create a true classic here. The video itself is pure genius and really works well with the band's emotional message of loneliness.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Many people would like to think Keane are some sort of genius and revolutionary band. However, they are not - not yet anyway. Only time will tell if they can go on to produce a second album of this depth and scope. I suffered from disliking this album when I first bought it because I thought every song sounded the same, when all you need to do is take the time to really sit down and listen to each song thoroughly. I urge anyone to buy this album now, it really is fantastic.s could be an album that has no flaws at all!

B000002UJQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, just not a great one. It's pretty much the only album by Radiohead that I consider average. The reason this album gets 4 stars is because of Paranoid Android and Karma Police, both outstanding songs. Those two are 5 star songs, while the rest of the album is made up of three stars. Though it's not their best album, buy it if you're a Radiohead fan. It represents an important change in Radiohead's style.
B00000I8UK|3.0|I love Eric Dolphy.  If I were only permitted to listen to a single horn-player, he would be my choice.  I also feel that of all the brilliant innovators of 60's jazz his legacy opened the greatest number of doors.  He combined an extrordinary level of traditional musicianship (interdisciplinary) with an unbelievably open mind about pure sound.  All that said, I really don't like this record.  I've listened to it hundreds of times, hoping to get to a better place with it.  The ideas sound too ambitious for the performers.  They clunk along cluelessly in the odd meters, for instance, I feel like I can hear them tensely counting in five.  They seem lost in some of the free sections.  I don't think this is their fault.  With adequate rehearsal this probably would have been the brilliant accomplishment most of the other reviewers feel it is.  I often run into people for whom this was their first exposure to Eric Dolphy and it saddens me.  I much prefer the more traditional LAST DATE (the first two choruses of Miss Ann are my favorite example of his alto playing), the ensemble playing of the compositions and the two duets with Richard Davis on IRON MAN, and his playing throughout THE GREAT CONCERT OF CHARLES MINGUS including his unaccompanied bass clarinet solo on Orange was the Color of her Dress (OUT!!).   Tragically, he never got to make the music he wanted to with these ideas and I value this album as a signpost pointing to the kinds of things he had in mind.  Andrew Hill's Point of Departure (also with Eric, Richard Davis, and Tony Williams) from the same period is less ambitious in its concepts, but within the capabilities of the musicians.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is a simple CD, as is the Sex Pistols a simple band, and their music, simple music. Nevertheless the music here has amazing energy and is fun everytime to listen to. Not a punk fan myself, but I love this album.
B00004Z459|5.0|I wasn't always a huge fan of LP, but ever since i bought this album, it pretty much changed my life. I listened to the whole albm and realised that i liked all of the songs - which never happened 2 me before to any other cd i bought. I couldn't pick a fav. All of my friends have got this and their my fav band ever now! it's actually 10/5 starz. Believe me you'll regret big time not buying this. <br />and p.s. Chester is hott!
B000067CPX|2.0|What happened to the Chili Peppers? I don't know, they've been popular for many a year but have never been tempted to change their sound for the masses. I guess they changed their minds. I love the funky RHCP from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, not this bland pop. Unless RHCP changes it's house I guess I'll just listen to their older albums.  <br />Don't buy it.
B0000262QW|5.0|This album is the absolute ONLY essencial Return To Forvever album.It's also the first and the one with the closest <br />links to traditional jazz.Chick Corea plays imaginative electric <br />piano in a buyount latin-fusion setting on the title song,the <br />tremendous \\"Crystal Silence\\" and the sidelong \\"Sometime Ago/Le Fiesta\\"-all matched by Flora Purim's souring vocal flights and <br />the accompayment of Joes Farrell's fluttering horns and <br />Stanley Clarkes seldom heard vamping on acoutsic bass.On <br />\\"What Game Shall We Play\\" Flora Purim sings a pretty little <br />Brazillian dance lyric and rounds out this very listenable  <br />album.Word of warning-this is the pre-Lenny White addition of <br />Return To Forever and contains NONE of the heavy overplaying that graced the large majority of this fusion band's catolog. <br />So 'Return To Forever' along with it's followup (also with <br />Flora Purim) might be all the Return To Forever you'll need. <br />It also makes a strong point that Flora and her joyously <br />drumming husband Airto should've remained with this group-they <br />were never really were the same without them.

B00003CXHJ|1.0|If I could award this film no stars I would. There is nothing positive to say about it. <br /> <br />As a historian, I bought this film well aware that its interpretation was jingoistic Hollywood tripe (no surprises there, then) but I enjoy both sub movies and blockbuster action films, and the cast looked suitably impressive, so I chanced my luck. However, the staggering tragedy of this film is its unforgivable failure to involve, despite the dramatic gift of being set in a sub, a surefire claustrophia-filled setting. Instead, it becomes a comedy for all the wrong reasons. The acting is universally dire, including Harvey Keitel's worst ever performance, the script is nonsense, the history is bunk, and the director should be ... Sorry, but words defy me. Even the audio fails to live up to DVD expectations. The much-quoted Das Boot, originally released for TV in 1982, is now on DVD with far superior surround sound effects. Those who enjoyed this should really question their standards. I feel scarred. Absolutely dreadful. <br /> <br />This movie deserves a nuclear depth charge.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I am not a religious fanatic and haven't gone to church all my life so I guess I was just out of the loop on this movie. It was obviously geared toward avid church goers because there was no background the movie just began on the usumption that the viewer already knew everything. I really went into this movie with an open mind and was kind of hoping to be moved, but I wasn't. All through out the movie there were so many Braveheart references it was sickening, as far as directing originality- there was none. I watch alot of true story movies and this was not one of those movies. There is no way that ANYBODY could survive the whipping he took, and IF they did they would not be concious especially not concious enough to carry a big wooden cross as far as he did. I hate when people pick movies apart but this movie was so full of holes it was realisticaly pathetic. I guess it was so ultra sappy it was just hard to stay interested, Mel could have done more to draw in the non-church going crowd. Mel Gibson is a gifted director, but this movie was biting too much on Braveheart's success and it showed all through out the film. I would think after seeing this movie people would be even more skeptical of the events that supposedly took place at that point in history because I already was a skeptic and now this whole Jesus phenomena is all the more laughable. Mel is a sick individual and he just made millions tugging at the heart strings of all of these \\"Christians\\" and is about to make millions more because these \\"Christians\\" will probably gobble this movie up and use it as a \\"teaching\\" tool for all of the future brainwashees in all of the churches across the country. I will end by saying \\"To each, his own!\\"
B00005221L|5.0|This one starts out like just another Rambo / Missing In Action type movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a team of commandos into the deep jungles of central america to rescue hostages from a rebel group. Lots of explosions and machinegun blasts later, the mission is accomplished, sort of. Arnold and company manage to leave only one female rebel alive, and no hostages survive! The mission is not what it appeared to be and Arny realizes he's been lied to by the CIA. So, now they must trek through the jungle to find their own way out. Now things get interesting! The commandos (including Arny, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, et. al.) are being stalked and killed one by one by an invisible alien creature. No one stands a chance against it's stealth and superior technology. The PREDATOR hops from tree to tree like an invisible monkey, slaughtering Arny's men in grisly, messy ways! It all comes down to Arnold and the PREDATOR, mono y mono in the final conflict! The tables have turned on the Terminator, who must now rely on his wits and ingenuity to defeat his relentless, seemingly indestructible foe. Directed by John Mctiernan (Die Hard), PREDATOR is an almost non-stop blast of pure mega-violence! Arnold is in peak condition, and Stan Winston's monster is totally convincing. Watch and see what the governor of california used to do for a living! Outstanding...
B0002IU988|5.0|I had been a DIEHARD CREED fan, for a few years, and was so disappointed when they split up. Like many other fans, I thought their music was the be all to end all..until I heard Alter Bridge! Listening to CREED, I always knew that Mark, Flip and Brian had so much talent; but with Myles Kennedy in the mix, the talent of the other band members is magnified ten-fold. His vocal range and the passion in his voice are indescribeable! Each time I listen to \\"One Day Remains\\", I find something more awesome than the last time. It's just AMAZING! Even if you hated CREED, you MUST check out this band and their new music..You WON'T be sorry!
B00029NMRW|1.0|My wife brought this turkey home from Blockbuster. The plot and dialogue is lame. A husband and wife team are \\"hit men.\\" The wife can't shoot straight and the husbnad is retired from the business. the plot centers around a Hungarian mob leader who is released from prison and wants vengance on the retired hit man (Bruce Willis) and a dentist, Mathew Perry. It goes down hill from here. The only interesting characters were the mobster and his son and the son was killed off about mid-movie. This move is a real stinker. Don't waste your time.

B00003CXA3|5.0|A NEW YORK DETECTIVE [GENE HACKMAN] CHASES A FRENCH DRUG RING. VERY WELL ACTED AND VERY GOOD STORY. UNLIKE OTHER ACTION FILMS, THERE ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH ACTION. SO IN ALL ACTUALITY, IT'S NOT REALLY AN ACTION FILM. IT'S REALLY MORE OF A MYSTERY MOVIE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT IN ITS HIGHEST FORM! ROY SCHEIDER ALSO SHINES IN THIS MOVIE AS POPEYE DOYLE'S PARTNER. WATCH FOR THE CLASSIC CHASE SCENE. THIS ''ACTION'' FILM ACTUALLY WON SEVERAL OSCARS, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE. A REAL CLASSIC. ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL.
B00005JN2F|5.0|THIS is what good movies are made of.  Trust me, I work at a video store.  Too bad most people prefer junk such as 'Catwoman' or 'Runaway Bride' to truly intelligent, well-done films like this. <br /> <br />Matt Damon is one of the few action stars with a (very brilliant) mind.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie shows the reality of a older sister that has to take care of the sibling brother and does it quite frequently.  Then the older sister Sarah (Jennifer Conelly) wishes her brother Toby away and realizes that she actually did wish him away and ends up meeting Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie) who is her big obstacle in getting her brother back.  It proves to be a well thought out movie with great charaters and settings.  Jareth proves to be a seductive obstacle to Sarah but she is oblivious to that.  David Bowie proves to be a sexy charming but ohh so bad in the role of the Goblin King with a young Jennifer Connelly (sp?)  giving Sarah such a great niavete that is excellently executed given her little experience.  A must watch!
6305907145|1.0|If you are not an Austen fan or have never read Mansfield Park, then this movie may be enjoyable for you.  Despite the slightly rushed pace, it has characters with some depth, a twisted coil of relationships and the lovely Frances O'Conner. However, if you have read the novel, this movie will be atrocious to watch. This director clearly had a certain agenda she wanted to push and Mansfield Park was the unfortunate story she picked to convey that.   <br /> <br />She tries to make all the characters complex and well-rounded, with tangled emotions of real life. While admirable, the results are rather unbelievable in places and, for fans of the novel, completely ridiculous.  The characters of Tom, Mr. Bertram, Mr. Price and even the main character, Fanny Price, are unrecognizable!  Rather than the carefree, spendthrift Tom of the book, we're given a passionate, rebellious and very moralistic young man.  Worst however is the representation of Fanny.  No longer the unassuming and submissive girl Austen wrote of, she is now outspoken, bold and almost disrespectful, to the point where she is even told she has a tongue \\"sharp as a guillotine\\".   <br /> <br />The director clearly had some social concerns she wanted addressed--namely slavery and the effects (both positive and negative) of education as well as the possibility of re-educating someone into an entirely different person, much like this movie which is quite different from the book.  Those are fine topics that are not a part of Mansfield Park. And while these are very serious topics, the pacing and tone of this movie is light and comedic which does away with much (if not all) of the necessary gravity.   <br /> <br />All in all, unless you are unfamiliar with Austen or are a huge O'Conner fan, save yourself 2 hours and don't bother watching.
B000286S8S|4.0|Even for you pure DLR Van Halen fans, this CD is great, Sammy doesn't stretch too far into Roth territory. I hated Van Haggar at first but these are the songs which helped me with the transition. This is a good collection.
0684833395|5.0|First of all, it is necessary to notify potential readers unfamiliar with this book that the writing style is very colloquial and the humor quirky.  If you are looking for high-brow writing, I would say you are probably not looking in the right place.  The author has a very conversational tone that verges on stream-of-consciousness writing. <br /> <br />If you have seen the (1960's era?) movie, don't let that affect your decision to read this book.  I thought the movie was OK, and it certainly followed the story mostly, but there was too much in the book to faithfully transfer the characters to film.  Of course, this criticism stands for most books that turn into movies... <br /> <br />The book, as I mentioned, has a very off-beat narrative style.  Heller is very funny, but I don't think his sense of humor could be considered traditional.  That said, When I read the book the imagery was so rich, and the dialogue and situations so crisp, that I could not help but laugh out loud on the BART (the local public transit system). <br /> <br />Catch-22 mostly reads as a collection of stories about different interrelated characters.  The book also does not have an entirely linear timeline-I'd guess that about one quarter of the book mostly relates to flashbacks the main character has. <br /> <br />If you believe, like me, that great literature comes in many shapes and sizes, I can't think of a book that I can recommend more highly. <br /> <br />As an interesting side-note, Heller mentioned on at least one occasion that the characters in Catch-22 were completely fictitious.  He did serve in the military, but he never had anything but praise for his collleagues and superior officers. <br /> <br />YOSSARIAN LIVES!!!
B0000000LI|5.0|after watching the PBS special i thought to myself wow what a great bit of music so  i went out and bought this album.after  repeated playings i came away thinking there's now a bad bit of music  here. shortly there after i saw a larry king special where Yanni was the guest and when asked where he gets his ideas from and how does he write his music . his answer was they just come to him. he then added his own belief that music should be uplifting and have passion in it.  the listener he said should then be able to conjure up his/her own images and feelings when listening to the same.this is what this album does to me.listening to it is one big auditorial and visual trip. one mans dream for example leads me to images of a searching for a true love lost. while with standing in motion i can really see all these images of the world moving around an individual lost in the complexities that the world throws at us. i gave this album to a friend who at the time was quite ill with cancer. she later said that this CD was very uplifting and  provided her with a sense of calm . two things she  was really needing and having a difficult time finding. this is what Yanni was aluding to when he said music should supply people with feelings and images. Yanni is a talented individual. some people will have no use for him but to me he's one very talented composer.  he's not for everybody but if you decide you just have to have a Yanni album this one should be it. oh and i must add the support Yanni receives from the individual musicans and the london symphony is first rate. 5 stars .
0375703764|3.0|Wow.  I don't remember, upon reading \\"jimmin\\"'s review, him saying that the book was bad.  \\"too deep and convoluted for me\\" doesn't mean \\"too deep and convoluted for everyone.\\"  It seems that when Space Cowboy learned how to read in school, he probably should have also learned that an opinion isn't the same as a fact and that it's possible that House of Leaves isn't for everyone.  Personally I'm about 200 pages into the book and I'm having trouble continuing.  It becomes a burden at times, but I don't enjoy giving up on a book, I like to see them through.  I also happen to be a fan of Anne Rice.  I wouldn't call her an amazing symbolic writer, and I wouldn't put \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" into the category of literature, but making a personal attack on someone who enjoyed a book that you didn't is kind of childish, wouldn't you agree, Space Coyote?
B0002IU988|5.0|I met the band on Monday..I won a radio contest and hug out with them in the WMMS buzzard studio..while they answered questions, and sang four tracks off the album. Super Nice guys! And this album is amazing. I got it that day from the radio station people and listened to it every time I am in the car since..It truly is a great album. I also was given a DVD of the video for .Open your eyes..and its amazing..they rock and so does this album ..so get out there and get it!
B00007LTIA|5.0|This is the ultimate YES work, written for their fans and themselves.  Anyone who truly enjoys Yes, will find this CD to be an enjoyable and aspiring piece of music.  Others will not. This is my favorite Yes work since it truly requires the listener to understand what they attempted to accomplish and accept the scope of their effort.  Many bands of this era also attempted such works with varying success.  But all knew, back then, that they were writing for their fans and not some marketing concept.  This is a treat to enjoy if you are truly a fan of YES.
B000058T5E|5.0|This release cooks! High intensity, flippin' top shelf! I checked out Jeffrey at the 9:30 in DC on Mar 18th 2001 and I am really glad I did. I almost missed it because it wasn't really promoted the way I envisioned a Jeff Beck event would be.<br /><br />Why the 4 stars and not the 5. Well.... even though he's checking in with Techno and staying on with the progressive slant to his career. He's almost sounding formulated. Since Guitar shop you get the screamers, the blusey, hyped up delta song, The Veil type of song. But, hey his chemistry checks in and goes to work. Plus having been a fan since the early 70's and a musician I'm only going to congratulate him and say.... dig this cat! I wonder what a George Martin production would sound like at this juncture? And Jeff... don't take so long to swing back through the area for some shows.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film is either a love it or hate it kind of movie.  I could relate to the characters and the situation they were in.  We've all been in relationships where the other person was there but only physically.  In Lost in Translation you see what it's like when two people come together who need someone to be there completely.  The pacing may be slow for some people, but for me every moment was filled with a character revelation.  It also made me want to visit Japan!
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Although, as many others are quick to point out, there are better bands out there in the world. But not every band out there can be, and if you only listen to the best band in the world, your CD collection will be mighty thin. It is obvious that these guys aren't here to replace Metalica and such metal bands or punk bands of equal caliber. They are here to make music that is enjoyable to listen to and if your willing to listen to that then get this CD. Some people will disagree with me and say that they're not worth listening to, but if everyone agreed about what music to listen to then music would get real boring real quick. Since you won't know whether you like these guys till you listen to them, go to there site and listen to the sample tracks and this will give you a feel of what they're like. Don't listen what everyone tries to tell or what i'm telling just listen and deside for yourself.
B00004BZ16|5.0|A few of the reviewers here said that the best way to enjoy \\"Sandinista\\" was to download the album and pick out your favorite songs, and then put it onto one CD. That'd make \\"Sandinista\\" more consise, more penetrable, and generally more better.    Having a subscription to an mp3 service, I downloaded the entire album anxiously. About a month before, I bought \\"London Calling\\" and became addicted -- and I wanted to see how the Clash could mess up so badly in only a year's time (\\"Sandinista\\" was released a year after \\"London Calling\\").    When all of the tracks were finally downloaded, I began listening to them, one by one.    First track -- Magnificent Seven. Initial reaction? \\"...wow. This is... amazing! But then again, everyone said it was one of the GOOD tracks, so I guess it's not that much of a surprise.\\"    Second track -- Hitsville UK. \\"..I've never really heard anything like this before. A woman singing in a Clash song? Who is she? I like her voice. ...this is pretty catchy. Like really catchy. Um, yep, I like this song too.\\"    Next up -- Junco Partner. Knowing in advance that not much was said about this track, I expected it to be one of the \\"bad\\" songs/experiments. Initial reaction? \\"...hey! This is the Clash doing reggae again, like on 'London Calling'! I like the little violin touches. And what is that? A keyboard? Or a toy piano? Whatever it is, it sounds cool.\\"    And so on and so on. I think you get the idea.    I ended up liking every song, actually. I'm not exaggerating because I'm trying to be some demented Clash fanboy or something -- every single track on \\"Sandinista\\" is at the very least interesting. It never, ever bores me. If the music is somewhat lacking on a given track, the lyrics make up for it. And vice versa. Most of the time, like on \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" or \\"Magnificent Seven,\\" the lyrics and the music are both equally excellent.    I mean, really -- the entire first disc is a great album on it's own as it is. While some might think it's redundant to have \\"One More Dub\\" next to the original version, it's just like one whole song to me, both of them. And seeing how it's really not that bad of a song to begin with, I actually like having the dub right next to the original version.    The second half of disc two gets even more wildly experimental -- and I will admit it's the part I listen to the least. Even still, when I do listen to the various dubs and backwards tracks and songs like \\"Junkie Slip\\" on that portion of the disc, I always find myself interested in the sonic detail and what not of the songs. And the child-friendly version of \\"Career Opportunities\\" is fantastic.    See how long my review is already? I guess I'll stop now for your sake. But realize that because of my love for this album, I could write dozens and dozens of more pages about it.    One last thing: I just wanted to thank a few of the reviewers on here who gave the album a negative review. You guys/girls piqued my curosity enough to find out for myself if it was good or not. And, I must say, it's good. Quite good indeed.
B000001EC1|4.0|Ok we all know that \\"Never Say Goodbye\\",\\"Born To Be My Baby\\",and \\"Living In Sin\\" are missing.....damn it sucks.But when putting a greatest hits together like this you can't be to picky.Maybe they will release a newer hits or essential package later that will have them on it.Its alright for the casual fan.At least they put two songs from their older albums here.
B000059QY2|5.0|Opera is about music. Acting, staging, costumes et cetera add to the pleasure, but when all is said and done, the music is it. I bought this album just before my wife and I went to see an Australian Opera production, (wonderful, by the way), so that we could do our homework on the piece. I didn't particularly like all of the stagy, arty-farty special effects included on the DVD or the outlandish costumes or the primary school acting. But the music! Pavarotti is, as usual, fine as the Duke (I have a couple of other recordings by him in the role). But here, the others all compete with him on equal terms. Even the bit parts are sung with world class voices and memorable artistry. And if you want to hear what Rigoletto should sound like then Wixell is the one. Buy it and weep.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ has caused rousing controversy all over America. People have called it anti-semitic and a gore-fest. I believe this movie is more complicated than that.  <br />      <br />The controversy over the alleged anti-semitism has been discussed over and over, so I won't go into it again. <br /> <br />     This movie is extremely bloody, and is definitely not for the queasy. However, I think I found some reasoning to it. Many people have said that the violence is overexaggerated, and I agree with them, though not for the same reasons. When watching the scenes of Jesus being tortured, you tend to cringe or empathize with Jesus. You can almost *feel* the pain when watching the scenes of violence, and I believe that was the idea. Maybe Jesus was tortured that much, maybe not, but the point is to get the audience to feel emotion, possibly imagine what it must have been like to go through that pain.  <br /> <br />     One interesting point of the movie is the relationship between Jesus and his mother. The flashbacks between the two of them are some of the most emotional of the movie.  <br /> <br />     My main problem with this movie is the theme of hopelessness. There is virtually none of Christ's teachings at all, and almost no references to Christ's resurrection. This is not the first interpretation to do so (Jesus Christ Superstar ends in a similar way) but it should have some message of hope after all that pain. Still, it was a good movie to see, and it will certainly leave you thinking.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I liked the album, it's different from \\"Let go\\". Great Lyrics, great sound.    <br />   <br />Take me away: Good, it's depressing but it's true! \\"Is there inside all I do is hide...\\" I think She talks about herself, it's deeper and meaningful. Great rock elements on the chorus. 10/10   <br />   <br />Together: It's a great song. I feel so identified with it. The best part is: \\"My thoughts are choking on you my dear\\". I liked the guitar. 10/10   <br />   <br />Don't tell me: It's a popish song, but I liked. Good Message: Don't give it to the boys who only wants your sex. hehe.    <br />   <br />He wasn't: I liked! It reminds me a little about \\"Sk8er Boi\\", the music. It's not great lyrically, but aceptable. It's quite funny, is about the guy that you like doesn't give you a call. \\"He never make me feel Like I was special, cuz I was special, cuz I'm special...\\" Bit weird! But I liked! 8/10   <br />   <br />How Does it feel: I liked the lyrics, but I don't like much the song, just because I'm not lover of ballads. But it's good. 7/10   <br />   <br />My Happy Ending: I understand perfectly why Avril could write a song like this. I really like it, it's a good song, quite sad but good. 9/10   <br />   <br />Nobody's Home: Quite soft, but one of my favorites. Great chorus, great lyrics!!! Next single, good choice as a single. She talks about her, she's human... she shows how ie really her inside.    <br />   <br />Forgotten: My favorite song of the album. Strong, sad, dark and angry. That's what I like!!! 11/10. The piano it's great, the voice of Avril with her \\"ah, ah\\" it's amazing, cool!   <br />   <br />Who Knows: I don't like it much. But I like the lyrics. 7/10   <br />   <br />Fall To pieces: Interesting, it shows an Avril who is in love with a guy. \\"I just wanna cry in front of you\\", I feel identified. whoa! I really liked!! Great Ballad. 10/10   <br />   <br />Freak Out: It's a funny song, about being crazy for a while. Optimistic! I like the guitars and the bass!9/10   <br />   <br />Slipped Away: Good song, but quite sad and slow. I liked but is not my favorite. 8/10   <br />   <br />I always get what I want: It's sounds weird, like recorded in a garage. Explosive, fast, great guitars, her voice sounds weird, but I like it! 8/10   <br />   <br />Well, this album is much better than \\"Let go\\" because it's different in so many ways. I recommend this album.    <br />   <br />By the way...All the Avril haters can kiss my a**!!!!!
B00012FXB8|5.0|David Fincher was really on to something with this picture. <br />The least imitated picture in the franchise remains the only film with replay value as the two predecessers Alien and Aliens are so completely dull.  I can't even watch those two anymore primarily because the story and dialogue has been copied and immitated by dozens of shlock films out there.  Alien 3 works really well by tapping into the cynism and pessimism of the modern world.  A world where nothing is what it seems and hypocrisy, fraud, and corruption are the norm.  Fincher is smart guy and I respect him for that.  Anyway I recommend this film over all the rest as it is a dark Shakespearan tragedy with a gothic religious style to it.  Composer Elliot Goldenthal's score is another wonderful feature of this film.  I wonder if him and Fincher would collaborate again.
B000089CJI|3.0|I was addicted to this CD a while ago for quite some time. If you have never heard this before don't hesitate to pick it up. It's a very fun album that will have you hooked in no time. The problem is, it gets old. It doesn't really get old fast but when it does, you never want to hear it again. About a month after I got sick of this CD one of my good friends got hooked and everytime I went over there he insisted on playing it and I couldn't stand it. It's good while it lasts, but that goodness doesn't last as long as I'd hoped.
B0002IU988|5.0|Over the last decade and a half I've seen Rock and Roll go from the hard-hitting, guitar soloing, MTV building, partying,  fun stadium anthem king of airplay format to a whiny, depressed and anticlamactic gob of overly emotional malarchy. Mind you, some bands have kept true to the spirit of Rock over the years, but most unfortunately missed the mark and made missing the mark the standard of the genre.<br /><br />  There will always be room for the deep thinkers of our time and the \\"sad and lonely\\" and \\"my parents hated me\\" songs will always have an audience, but I'm finally beginning to hear music reminiscent of the days when Rock and Roll was cool. Once again I'm beginning to hear the instrument of Rock - the almighty guitar - being used as a tool with it's own voice instead of a chord-crunching background instrument.<br /><br />  Who will become the new Guitar Gods of our time? Mark Tremonti has definitely earned his slot in my opinion. I always enjoyed the music of Creed as a whole because there was something there that had been missing from so-called Rock music for some time up to that point - well structured guitar riffs with attitude. Now that Alter Bridge is here, Tremonti is able to spread his wings and showcase his talent to a much higher degree with even more intricate licks and riffs and the inclusion of ear shredding guitar solos.<br /><br />  Also with bands such as Van Halen and ZZ Top putting out new material, Central Florida's Validium rapidly gaining strenth, and Velvet Revolver (YES! Bring it back, Slash!) coming to fruition, Rock and Roll is surely on it's way for a true comeback.<br /><br />  I can't wait to see what happens when \\"One Day Remains\\" hits as a single. All the closet guitar \\"geeks\\" of the world will be able to proudly look up to true heroes once again and emerge as soon to be Guitar Gods themselves now that the likes of Mark Tremonti, Eddie Van Halen, Dan Rodriguez and Slash are taking the stage again. Hey, Rock and Rollers! Wipe the tears from your eyes, drink a beer and try not to be so angry all the time, and get ready to party. The boys are back in town!s, drink a beer and try not to be so angry all the time, and get ready to party. The boys are back in town!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This is one of those films that was, in essense, ruined in the interests of a studios hopes of making it \\"commercial\\". As such it provides a good lesson to every filmmaker as well as every fan of cinema. <br /> <br />I originally saw the theatrical release version and although I found it thought-provoking it seemed to dissolve in the end quite unsatisfyingly. <br /> <br />Then I got the DVD Director's cut release. Having already seen it the way the studio wanted I watched the Director's cut. And I was completely floored. Not only did the admitedly minor changes (the addition of a few short scenes in the body of the film and an entirely different ending) completely alter the point of the film it elevated it from merely another creepy science fiction foray into the world of \\"time travel\\" and into the realm of, what I consider, art. <br /> <br />My recommendation for those who have not seen this film would be: <br /> <br />1. Watch the \\"theatrical release\\" version (it's on one side of the disk) first. <br /> <br />2. Wait a little while, say a week. <br /> <br />3. Watch the \\"director's cut\\" side. (Feel free to fast forward through sequences that look familiar) <br /> <br />For me this was a rare case where something I thought I had seen and understood was totally changed because of finally seeing the director's vision (rather than what the studio hoped would make it successful.) I had an emotional reaction to the director's cut similar to that I experienced upon first seeing the ending of \\"Sixth Sense\\"... despite the fact that I'd already seen the theatrical release version of this film. And isn't that what we go to movies for in the first place? <br /> <br />One WARNING: <br />This is not an easy film to \\"enjoy\\". It is about as far from a \\"feel good\\" experience as you can get. Indeed, it vaguely reminded me of helplessly watching a puppy being methodically beaten to death. It is brutal, disheartening, depressing and never seems to let up despite the best intentions of the main character. But then art isn't always necessarily \\"pretty\\". What it tells you is sometimes what you do not want to hear. That is definitely the case with this film. <br /> <br />Perhaps that's why so many people absolutely hated this film. It's not easy to watch and can be quite disturbing. If you want something merely entertaining, look elsewhere. <br /> <br />But if you found yourself one of the rare fans of \\"Unbreakable\\", because (rather than in spite) of the fact that it didn't live up to any pre-concieved expectations you might have had, then do see \\"The Butterfly Effect\\".  <br /> <br />I think in years to come the Director's cut will be more greatly appreciated for what it is... unique.
B000001EKX|4.0|What surprises me about this album is that Paul Stanley almost seems subdued on it rather than being the usual upstart front man. <br />The album seems to be more dominated by Gene,Peter and Ace. <br />The Simmons' songs are nothing great but what makes the album special is the extra vocals of Peter on Mainline and Strange Ways and the fact that Ace helped contribute 3 songs here writing wise. <br />Listen to Strange Ways especially: it shows what Ace and Peter can do when they are not interfered with by Gene and Paul.They definately added another element to Kiss!
0783227019|5.0|I know everyone praises Scarface and all, but this movie far exceeds Scarface.  I mean come on, all Scarface was was Stones attempt to write a script that would shock the public.  Which it did at the time.  Now, the stuff in that can be found in most gangster movies.  The beauty of this movie is that it never needs violence, or harsh language to get anything across.  This movie is like a great symphony.  It starts out with a few high notes, brings you back down slowly, and than just when you think it's going to stay at that pace, it brings you right back up with high notes and low notes mixed so masterfully together, and by the end you feel as though you've listened(watched) to some great masterpiece.  This movie shows is more realistic, more dark, has more heart, and makes you immersed in it more so than any other gangster movie I have ever seen, and I've seen them all.  From Goodfellas, to The Godfather, to Scarface, I've seen everyone.  The only movie I've seen that is this movies equal or better as far as in the gangster genre are the Godfather 1 and 2.  Still Pacino too.
B00000AF95|2.0|Some very raw rock here;that's why the 2 rating instead of a 1. <br />The opening song I've Had Enough is actually one of the best album openers Kiss has ever had and Under the Gun is not a bad tune as well BUT the rest of the songs fail to impress bigtime. <br />Thrills in The Night has to be one of the most annoying Kiss singles ever and all of Gene Simmons' songs sound so bad he must have wrote them while he was counting his money. <br />

B000001FQQ|1.0|This without a doubt has to be one of the worst albums Kiss ever released. <br />15 songs and hardly a good one in the bunch! <br />The song Rise to It can get very annoying unless your in a super party mood and the rest of the songs don't even really rate a mention. <br />Hide Your Heart was actually done better by Ace Frehley on his Trouble Walkin album.If Ace can upstage Paul on his own song what does that say about this album? <br />Not to mention if Paul has to co-write with Michael Bolton (Forever) than you know the Kiss of the make up days was totally scrapped beyond recognition~!
B000056N8X|3.0|Being a big Highlander fan, needless to say I was excited when this movie came to theaters. Funny thing about it was that I saw this movie 3 times and each time some scenes were different! I later found out why when it came to DVD.  <br /> <br />End Game follows immortals (and clansman)Connor and Duncan Mcleod's lives'adventures together and their challenege of facing what appears to be the most dangerous immortal of all (though that has been said in every Highlander movie... so I really cant say, but next to the Kurgan, yeah, you can say that), Jakob Kell. Kell is an evil immortal that is hell bent on destroying Connors life, because when Kell was mortal, Connor killed Kell's \\"father\\" out of anger... you'll see what I mean. Kell assembles a gang of immortal mercenaries that goes around killing other immortales so that Kell can become the most pwerful immortal (by cutting off their head and taking their quickiening a.k.a. their life power) and destroy Connor after he has tourtured his life enough. In the end, Connor and Duncan unite to battle Kell and try to rid the world of this evil immortal.  <br /> <br />Chris Lambert and Adrian Paul do a great job action and acting wise, but the movie feels rushed towards the end and some scences tend to clash with others because the movie took so long to film that the producers and director just rushed and threw what they could together. Bruce Payne does a great job with Kell's character, but at times, the over the top acting and dialogue does get a bit tiring. Bottom line, this movie/dvd is a must have any highlander fan and a good movie for any sci-fi fan or fan of this genre.  <br /> <br />The dvd itself is a good buy with the extras and even includes a early cut of the movie, which kinda leaves a bad taste in mouth as how bad the movie could have been if not for all the editors that worked on it and took out some of the really cheesie and unesscisary over the top scenes and acting.  <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is agood buy and a worthy addition to any sci-fi or action/drama fans dvd collection. <br /> <br />
B000001ELR|3.0|This is without a doubt the hardest album Kiss ever released. <br />It's been said many times but I'll say it again...great drum sound from Eric Carr! <br />The title tune as the opening number is cool as well as I love It Loud and I Still Love You. <br />Some of the songs however are pretty annoying like Keep Me Commin
B00005JCA9|5.0|One of the biggest box office smashes of 1999 and considered to be one of the best romantic comedies of the last TWO decades. In roles that earned Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant Golden Globe nominations, they give some of their best work to date.  Only the lazy, would be able to say Roberts is just \\"playing herself.\\" Just more oridinary folks thinking that they \\"know\\" a celebrity because they read about them in a magazine and watch their movies. In fact, she's playing a character and playing each note really well. With the most radiant smile and a laugh to cherish - she is a true MOVIESTAR (a word used way too much). In this film she's vulnerable & tough, funny & sweet, selfish and selfless.  From her that moment at the dinner table as she fights for her brownie, to the moment where she proclaims her love to Grant telling him \\"she's just a girl standing in front of a boy...\\" to her anger over the invasion that one celebrity of her stature receives. It is a glorious performance. Entertainment Weekly said she should be considered for an Oscar nomination - I agree. The movie gives ROMANTIC COMEDIES a good name.
B000001ELP|3.0|For all the downplaying of this album it actually isn't that bad. <br />There are a few highlights here such as The Oath and I which  has all the anthem appeal of Shout It Out Loud. <br />A World Without Heroes is actually one of the best songs Kiss ever released and Escape from the Island is a nice lil rare insturmental gem. <br />One feels if Ace Frehley and Eric Carr were allowed to have a little more of a presence on the album I feel this would have been a cool record. <br />Another negative was a terrible drum sound which even Eric Carr and Ace said they hated.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries, a photographer laid up with a broken leg who has taken to spying on his neighbors to alleviate his boredom.  He becomes suspicious that one of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), has murdered his wife (Irene Winston) and enlists his beautiful girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and visiting nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), to investigate.  There is a lot to occupy your mind in this film aside from the pure suspense of the plot.  You can ponder Jeffries's inability to commit to Lisa (could the cast on his leg be a symbol of impotence?).  Jeffries's profession is essentially voyeuristic--has he forgotten that he can be an active participant in events?  Aside from his reluctance to engage with Lisa, there is at least one crucial moment in the film when he remains inactive even though there are avenues of action open to him.  Director Alfred Hitchcock even alludes to the voyeuristic nature of film-watching; at times our characters appear to be filmgoers on the edges of their seats as they view the goings-on outside Jeffries's window.  This film is highly recommended./
1559279478|1.0|I bought and read almost all of FF's novels and enjoyed most. This  publication is a bummer! My feeling is someone is re-writing history in a very distorted fashion for pure political reasons. Not so much Vietnam or Bosnia etc. but our own relations with OBL and his organization.  <br />It is historical knowledge that OBL is a true friend of the Bush family, that he was on the CIA payroll and still may be. The reasons that the arabic world hates us is not religious as this book makes you believe, but mainly found in a never-ending middle eastern conflict.  <br />To write a third grade book and semi-hiding just on the side some political statements, unproven and untrue, is scandalous. To see a review by someone under the signature of Gingrich only adds to the propagandistic \\"value\\" of this book.  <br />As much as I have tried, I can't find FF's original talent as a foremost writer of fiction anyplace in this \\"novel\\" I will save your readers time by rehashing the storyline, but it is amateurish and not believable
B000063UR2|5.0|Let me just start by saying that Legend the ultimate edition has both Director's cut, and the American release.  Although the Director's cut is interesting,  I will always remain a huge fan of the American version, w/ the Tangerine Dream score.  The American release has a better ending, and just seems more magical.  Legend is Ridley Scott's crowning achievement.  No other fantasy movie comes remotely close to this film.  Sure, I liked the Lord of the Rings films, but I can honestly say that Computer generated creatures, and effects have ruined modern film.  No matter how real it looks on screen,  I can always tell when something is CGI, and where it is supposed to create an immersive experience, it distracts, and ruins the feel of a live action movie. I can't believe that almost every film critic thought Legend was a bad movie.  Either They are all robots with no sense of imagination, or  They just hate to be taken on a journey of the Fantasy realm.  Maybe I'm Bias, after all I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons, and loving every minute of it.  All I know, is if you are a true Fantasy fan, and like Dungeons, Unicorns, Goblins, Elves etc.  This is the movie for you.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Anyone who sees this film, and still votes for Bush, is a brainless ditto-head, whose thought process and critical thinking skills have been erradicated either by overexposure to Fox \\"News\\", Rush Limbaugh, or Karl Rove has taken over your brain.  Dispute whether this is a documentary or propaganda all you would like. Doesn't matter.  Was the Iraq war really fought for oil and war profiteering or to remove despot from a rogue state? Even that doesn't matter, at least not at this point, anyway. Is this scene or that fact or fiction? Even THAT doesn't matter. Like Moore, hate him - it's inconsequencial.  For this film contains one astonishing scene, caught on tape, that calls into question Bush's fitness to be commander-in-chief.  The infamous 7 minutes. <br /> <br />While our nation was under attack, Bush was advised by Andrew Card(?) as he read My Pet Goat to some fourth graders in a Florida school. There he stood, seemingly terrified, like a deer with its eyes caught in the headlights, with nary a clue what to do, for over seven minutes.  Unbelievable.  What an absolutely amazing display of ineptness and utter lack of leadership skill. If there is one sequence that exposes this president as the fraud that he is, it's that one.  <br /> <br />Have you ever been paged in the office and had to drop what you're doing because business crisis had emerged? Have you, in your life ever had to react to an emergency situation that required immediate action?  Our nation was under attack.  There was no question about it.  Our \\"quick thinking\\" leader sat - obviously terrified, reading My Pet Goat, in a critical situation when thousands (millions?) of lives were at stake, when time was of the essence, as our NATION WAS UNDER ATTACK BY TERRORISTS! <br /> <br />This scene alone should disqualify President Bush for a second term, he is simply, as evident by this sequence, unfit for command.  \\"War President\\", indeed.  When I heard about this scene, before I saw the film, I almost dismissed it.  I found myself (gasp) siding with the Bush apologists.  Uh uh, see it for yourself.  It completely calls into question Bush's ability to handle crisis situations.  I think it will even give hard right Bush supporters pause.  Disagree over ideologies - right vs left, there ARE fundamental characteristics that the leader of the free world must possess that transcend these ideologies.  Highest among them is the ability to handle a crisis.  Anyone who can't do it has no busness in the oval office.  Clearly Bush, as evident in this scene, doesn't have the right stuff.    <br /> <br />Having said that, the film completely misses the boat regarding an item critical to its thesis.  That item is The Project for a New American Century.  More attention needs to be focused on this document. For this, clearly, outlines the reasons we went to war in Iraq.  911 was viewed as a once in a lifetime window of opportunity to execute the neoconservative agenda; the democratization of the middle east through the use of force.  That they did, to the tune of approaching 1000 US military deaths, 10-15 thousand Iraqi deaths, and $200 billion US tax-payer dollars.  Moore leaves this out of his film.  Perhaps it isn't sensationalistic enough? I would love to know why. For me, its omission was a disappointing missed opportunity to bring the damned and damning document - the PNAC document, to the attention of the masses.  <br /> <br />Fool me once shame on, shame on you.  Fool me twice? We won't get fooled again.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I enjoyed Daredevil when I went to see it in theaters. I thought the acting was really on par. Although I thought Mr. Affleck seemed to kinda get dry on certain parts even though he did very well overall.  <br />The tone of the film was dark which is what made this film even more enjoyable because it is on par with what the actual superhero comics are. The director of Spider-man could have learned something from this.  <br />Also, I thought some of the violence was gruesome for a PG-13 film. But that goes to show ya how much you can get away with in the movie business these days.  <br />The action scenes were great and the story was very enjoyable and could even possibly rival the first two Batman films (which I still find to be the best comic book-to-movie films to date).  <br />Overall, I find Daredevil to be one of the better comic-book-to-movie films. But Hellboy proved to be a good rival to the film as well. In the end, it just goes to show you that, if handled correctly, comic book heroes can be in great films.
B00000JA9V|5.0|This is simply a timeless classic. The story behind the best selling debut off all time is simply amazing! (17 Million) <br /> <br />The soaring dueling Boston guitar sound mixed with Scholz' classical training is evident through-out all his works.  <br /> <br />Boston has been on tour this summer(2004) and sounds incredible. The live version of these classic rock staples are worth a hear in person. There are plenty of great reviews and press releases on the Gonna Hitch A Ride Fan Site that will simply reinforce the power of Boston's music today. Almost 30 years after it's original release this CD is guaranteed to give you hours and hours of musical pleasure. As you listen over and over to will always hear more and more of the layered textures that Scholz magnificently recorded on a Scully 8 Track that was recorded in the basement of his Watertown, MA apartment. Be sure to pick up a copy of Don't Look Back as well.
B000002I2I|5.0|I love this albumn.  It ROCKS! It's upbeat, fun , & is an alternative to  the darker songs of the earlier doors day's.  Teen-agers may not appreciate it as much as adults do because it is lighter material with a sexy bluesy feel. <br />I also love the sentimental songs like Im a spy & Indian Summer. <br />It's great to hear all sides of Jim Morrison.  This is my favorite albumn and I have all of them.   <br />For-ever a  fan of \\"The Doors\\"!
B00018TI5E|5.0|I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers so much so I was pleased to learn about John's own cds.  This is the first one of his that I bought, and it's not the last.  John Frusciante is an artist within everthing he hold to himself, no matter what media he's doing it in.  Every song on this album is a bit of that indiviual, beautiful and sad side about him.  I have heard nothing like this album and thats why I keep it close within me.  He has gone through a lot in life and he expresses that in some of the songs.  I loved this album.  So if you are willing to try something different without listening to Anthony Kiedis's voice but John Frusciante...believe me, you won't be disapointed.
B00004TDTO|5.0|One of the legendary and most terrifying thrillers ever made, from the future director legend Steven Speilberg, is the first summer blockbuster. The Movie that scared you out of the water and on the edge of your seat. Based on real shark attacks and Peter Belenchy's Best Selling novel is the story of New York Island town Amity Island, that is terrorized by a 25 foot Great White Shark and It's Up Cheif Martin Brody(Roy Schieder),Scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and Shark hunter Quint to go out to sea to kill the beast. This film is nonstop terrifying thrills,breathtaking and spetacular. Chomping Good fun. This is the most terrifying animal ever on the screen. If it wasn't for King Kong and the Birds there be no JAWS. A Movie so legendary that it got it's self a thrilling ride at Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood and I have been to both of them. See this thriling masterpiece it's been in our lives and scared us for 29 years and it's timeless. It's the time to see it and buy it. Oh and See it Before you go swimming<br />HA HA HA! the terror of the big blue below your feet.
B0002IU988|5.0|I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I p[icked up the album.  I was a fan of Creed back before they made it big but had grown tired of what the band evolved into.  The first single off of the album \\"open your eyes\\" sounded very much like a creed song, but if you think of it from a record label point of view Creed sold 10's of millions of records so it'd make sense to have that be the lead single in business terms.  FORTUNATLY, that song is pretty unique on the album.  There are tracks that just BLISTER your eardrums. The leadoff track, find the real is pretty heavy and the way the song flows and the vocal style do harken back to vintage soundgarden some as I have heard some peopel say.  Track #2, one day remains was my favorite from the start.  It shows that all the rumors that Stapp was holding back Mark's playing were true because he just RIPS the hell out of this song.  It literally dropped my jaw the first time I heard it and gave me chills.  Another standout is track 5, Metalingus, another full on metal song, very cool.  I'm a metalhead at heart so my fav songs will be the heavier ones.  Not that I will ignore the not as heavy ones, we'll get tot hem in a bit.  track 8, down to my last, is not as heavy but it flows well in a kind of creedish style with the clean verses and the dirty chorus but it flows very nicely, another of my favorite tracks.  The last song, the end is here, sounds very much liek something off of creeds second album human clay in the beginning but it ends shortly thereafter.  The clean single note lines degenerate into distorted chorus' and some just plain old heaviness near the end.  another great song.  Ok, as I promised, I won't ignore the softer/slower songs.  track 4, burn it down is pretty soft for these guys but it flows well and is well written. Broken wings, track 6, is another great tune.  the lyrics and vocals will get you on this one.  and while we are on lyrics and such, track 7, in loving memory, will just about bring tears to your eyes if you listen to the words. especially if you ahve ever lost someone very dear to you.  Mark helped write this song for his mother whom he lost to cancer.  For the most part it is a beautiful clean guitar song, sounding finger picked. It gets heavier toward the end but with Miles vocals it all ends in a crecendo rather than sounding hackneyed. That leaves tracks 9 and 10.  Watch your words adn Shed my skin respectively.  Miles vocals seem a little stretched in watch your words to be truthful but it is still a good song.  the guitar tracks are great.  Shed my skin is a really cool song, another one where you need to listen to the vocals, and the heart put into singing them.  Overall this is an amzing album, it has been in my cd player since the day it was released.  Everyone who thought that they woudl be creed part 2 was dead wrong.  This band is so far past where creed was eaded that I hate to evenb make comparisons save for the fact that everyone wants to know how they stack up.  If you are looking for where the real rock has gone in the world, you owe it to yourself to get this album!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is my second favorite Radiohead album only to Hail to the Thief. This album has less of the rock band feel of OK Computer and more of the Kid A electronica. Honestly, I hated this CD when I first listened to it. As with all Radiohead albums, it takes time to learn to like it. After the first week of listening to it, I started liking it more and more, and now it's one of my favorite albums of all time. I found this album to be not as strong as Kid A or Hail to the Thief, and the songs aren't quite as impressive. However, Amnesiac is a tremendous album that deserves a place on your CD rack. And yes, I'm one of the few who like Morning Bell/Amnesiac better than the original.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I will be the first to admit this film's flaws. At some points it does drag with no substantial dialogue, or anything for that matter. Likewise one could make an argument that \\"Kill Bill-Volume 1\\" was too much, with hardly any dialogue. So in reality, \\"Vol. 2\\" is really the balancing act. It provides a heart for the saga, without forgetting how to entertain. Whereas \\"Vol. 1\\" paid homage to Eastern influenced films through an anime scene, and through the brilliantly staged action sequences, \\"Vol. 2\\" pays homage to Western spaghettis through its black and white prologue, Texas \\"funeral\\", and of course Uma's fight with Daryl Hannah. The end scene with Bill, played brilliantly by David Carradine, is both sad and triumphant at the same time. And all the while, Tarantino hammers out a pretty solid, heartfelt story.
0385659806|5.0|&quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,&quot; is a terrific debut novel!  I was impressed at how well this new writer did with this unusual story.  I was hooked from the beginning and the plot held my attention throughout!  Very entertaining and well-worth the read!
B00008AWOD|5.0|Placebo's fourth album is their \\"mature\\" album because our favorite eyeliner wearing boys have grown up.  This is my least favorite album by Placebo for a couple of reasons.  This album is a mix of punk and electronics and I'm not into the whole electronics thing, but it's more punk than electronics so don't worry.  All so the lyrics and songs are all good, but nothing daring.  Nothing that really touches feelings and makes you take notice.  That's not to say that this is a bad album because it's not.  It's just different.  Newer Placebo fans will love it, because it is good, but old fans like myself, may find it a bit wimpy for Placebo, who has grown up.  <br /> <br />1. \\"Bulletproof Cupid\\"  7/10  Rocking Placebo song that is entirely instrumental. <br /> <br />2. \\"English Summer Rain\\"  9/10  Fun song.  It's the most electronic on the album, so don't expect anything more electronic <br /> <br />3. \\"This Picture\\"  8/10  Good song.  I love it because Brain is able to use the word \\"semaphore.\\"  How great is that?  This song has the Placebo sex tone because it has S.M. imagery in it. <br /> <br />4. \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\"  10/10  I really like this song even if it has a tad of political feel to it.  Pretty song. <br /> <br />5. \\"The Bitter End\\"  10/10  The heaviest rock song on the album.  Very good song with a dark side. <br /> <br />6. \\"Something Rotten\\" 6/10  A strange song about child abuse.  Not sure of what to make of it. <br /> <br />7. \\"Plasticine\\"  9/10  Loud and rockin'.  Classic Placebo theme in the lyrics... \\"Don't forget to be the way you are\\"  How very true. <br /> <br />8. \\"Special Needs\\"  8/10  Slower rock song, like most on the album.  Different lyrics. <br /> <br />9. \\"I'll Be Yours\\"  9/10  Great song.  Dark obsessive lyrics. <br /> <br />10.  \\"Second Sight\\" 8/10  Nice song and makes your foot tap. <br /> <br />11. \\"Protect Me From What I Want\\"  8/10  Brian uses his wit to sass social conformity and his own flaws. <br /> <br />12. \\"Centrefolds\\"  9/10Best part of this song is the uniqueness to the ballad.  It kind of sounds like Brain is making up the lyrics as he goes.  It's cool. <br />
B000255LIY|4.0|The 1968 screen version of THE LION IN WINTER (Lion1) is the most excellent film I've ever seen, or likely will see in my lifetime. But, I've a lot to say about various aspects of this new version (Lion2), so I'd better get on with it. I'll make an effort to be evenhanded.<br /><br />First, a concise history lesson in the context of the film.<br /><br />King Henry II of England is also overlord of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and half of France. Henry keeps his wife Eleanor, the Duchess of Aquitaine and the former first wife of King Louis VII of France, under house arrest in Salisbury Castle for revolting against him. In better times, Henry and Eleanor had, in addition to three daughters, five sons: (in order of birth) William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John. William died at age three. Henry, the anointed heir, died aged 28 in the summer of 1183. It's now the Yuletide season of that year, and Henry II is holding Christmas court at his French stronghold, Castle Chinon. (To be accurate, there's no record of a Christmas court at Chinon in 1183, but that's irrelevant to the essential theme and tone of the story.) Joining him are his surviving sons and, released from confinement for the festive occasion, Queen Eleanor. An aging Henry wishes to cement his succession. His favorite is John. Eleanor's is Richard. Geoffrey, nobody's favorite, maneuvers to get what he can. Complicating the gathering is the presence of Princess Alais and King Phillip II of France. Alais, Louis VII's daughter by his second wife, was betrothed to Richard by treaty between Henry and Louis when she was but a child. Alais has been living at the English court for years, and is Henry's mistress. (Author Sharon Kay Penman in her book [[ASIN:B001RNI1UU Devil's Brood]] effectively argues against Alais having been Henry's mistress. But, no matter; it adds to the film's plot.) Phillip, aged 18 and King since 1180, is Louis VII's son by a third wife. Phillip either wants the marriage of Alais and Richard to take place, or Alais's dowry, the French province of the Vexin, back. Phillip hates the English monarch, and will use Henry's sons against him any way he can. The holiday skullduggery is so thick as can be pierced with a backstabbing dirk.<br /><br />The music score is positively anemic compared to John Barry's original. Of particular note in Lion1 are the vaguely menacing \\"Main Title\\" that serves as introduction to the destructive passions in the plot, the elegant \\"Eleanor's Arrival\\", which accompanies her regal progress up river by open boat to Chinon, and the finale - \\"We're Jungle Creatures\\" - that underscores the approaching end to Henry's reign, but the beginning of the great Plantagenet dynasty.<br /><br />Costuming and sets are too pretty and finished. In Lion1, the interior of Chinon is gloomy, cold, rough-hewn, and smoky (from the torches) - perhaps to be expected in a 12th century pile. And the clothing, even for the royals, wasn't elegant by any stretch. (My favorite scene in the original has Henry casually throwing on a crown and royal cloak over otherwise plain garb before striding through the mud, dogs, chickens and peasants in the castle courtyard to greet the arriving Phillip.) In Lion2, the costumes are too fine and the castle interior, especially the main circular staircase, is too obviously a film set.<br /><br />The dialogue, perhaps the best ever heard on the Big Screen, is virtually the same in the two productions. However, the nuances from facial expressions, body language, and timing raise Lion1 to the realm of the sublime.<br /><br />The scripted action is also pretty much identical in both, except for three unnecessary sequences: an opening scene of Eleanor's failed rebellion in 1174, a silly shot of Richard riding his horse up Chinon's circular stairs, and another of Richard attempting to escape house arrest by rappelling down Chinon's walls.<br /><br />And how about the acting?<br /><br />In Lion2, Yuliya Vysotskaya as Alais is at least the equal of Jane Merrow's original. Indeed, Yuliya presents as a slightly stronger personality, and it doesn't hurt that she resembles a blonde Audrey Hepburn. And the new Phillip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) does a different and perhaps improved take on a relative youth striving to be a King in the face of the formidable and street-wise Henry, whereas Timothy Dalton in the role came across as a bit sinister and with the unscrupulous venom of a misplaced older man.<br /><br />Rafe Spall as the latter-day John occasionally overacts, in my opinion, almost to the point of parody, unlike Nigel Terry's right-on portrayal of the sullen youngest Prince. John Light is relatively light-weight as the contemporary Geoffrey compared to the sardonic and clever schemer revealed by John Castle. Andrew Howard as the new Richard, whatever the real-life man may have been like, didn't strike me as Lionheart material. The superficial trouble was the actor's unimposing voice. Anthony Hopkin's Richard, I think, would've wiped up the floor with the new guy.<br /><br />Lion1 starred Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn as Henry and Eleanor. Both received Oscar nominations, and the latter won her category. Only in the last third of Lion2, with Patrick Stewart as Henry and Glenn Close as Eleanor, does the power of their paired performance achieve that of Peter's and Kate's tour de force. Stewart and Close seem too amused with the familial dysfunction of their characters, almost playing them for laughs, especially in the early going. Whatever humor the audience perceives in the dialogue - and there's much, the real Henry and Eleanor, and O'Toole and Hepburn, squabbled over the succession with deadly seriousness. Also, Lion2 portrays both as white-haired ancients. In fact, Henry was only 51 at the time, though Eleanor was 11 years older.<br /><br />Had I not seen Lion1, I would've given Lion2 five stars. But the former is so superlative in all respects that I cannot.<br /><br />Finally, let's return to the historical record. An aged and weary Henry, perhaps the most energetic of England's monarchs, died of illness in July 1189, two days after being forced by the allied Richard and Phillip to accept humiliating terms ending a war. Richard succeeded to the throne, married Berengaria of Navarre, and was followed by John in 1199. (Geoffrey had died in 1186 in a tournament accident). Eleanor survived until 1204. John lost virtually all of his father's vast French holdings to Phillip. Alais returned to France to wed another.t the equal of Jane Merrow's original. Indeed, Yuliya presents as a slightly stronger personality, and it doesn't hurt that she resembles a blonde Audrey Hepburn. And the new Phillip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) does a different and perhaps improved take on a relative youth striving to be a King in the face of the formidable and street-wise Henry, whereas Timothy Dalton in the role came across as a bit sinister and with the unscrupulous venom of a misplaced older man.<br /><br />Rafe Spall as the latter-day John occasionally overacts, in my opinion, almost to the point of parody, unlike Nigel Terry's right-on portrayal of the sullen youngest Prince.

Whatever humor the audience perceives in the dialogue - and there's much, the real Henry and Eleanor, and O'Toole and Hepburn, squabbled over the succession with deadly seriousness. Also, Lion2 portrays both as white-haired ancients. In fact, Henry was only 51 at the time, though Eleanor was 11 years older.<br /><br />Had I not seen Lion1, I would've given Lion2 five stars. But the former is so superlative in all respects that I cannot.<br /><br />Finally, let's return to the historical record. An aged and weary Henry, perhaps the most energetic of England's monarchs, died of illness in July 1189, two days after being forced by the allied Richard and Phillip to accept humiliating terms ending a war. Richard succeeded to the throne, married Berengaria of Navarre, and was followed by John in 1199. (Geoffrey had died in 1186 in a tournament accident). Eleanor survived until 1204. John lost virtually all of his father's vast French holdings to Phillip. Alais returned to France to wed another.
B000001GRZ|5.0|I don't know why some people tend to look at Fournier's interpretation as being elegant and dance-like; I see his cello suites as more akin to the romantic element so apparent in Casals. I daresay that his playing is as fine as Casals; actually, there are some movements (such as the Prelude of the sixth suite) that Casals has hands over Fournier. But just the same, Fournier seems to have his moments too, such as the Gigue of the sixth suite. At any rate, it really does depend on your taste, but, being as objective as possible, Fournier, to me, seems to take a romantic view on Bach too, though a little less so than the dark romantic view of Casals; for example, Fournier does not stress the deep bass sounds of the cello as often as Casals does. To some, that might be a little improvement, but for the romantic listeners who prefer the strong sound of the bass, (which karajan often manipulates in his symphonies) Casals does seem to be more raw and bold in that respect.
B000059XUP|3.0|When watching this, the 2nd installment in The Crow movie series, you would only hurt the viewing experience by trying to compare it to the 1st film because as we all know, Brandon Lee will forever be Eric Draven and perhaps, the finest Crow of them all. But this film is meant to be different; in a different place, different time and with similar circumstances happening to very different people. <br /> <br />Vincent Perez brings his own stylings to this already overly stylish film. The use of reds and yellows to give the city a feeling of dirt, smog and an overcast of despondency works fairly well. The whole film feels much more surreal than even the first film's city did; the people here, more corrupt, violent and perverted but it's the triangle of stories that give the film the boost that pushes it out of the gutter of failed sequels. <br /> <br />Mia Kirshner does a fair job of playing a much older Sarah though her face reamins a bit too blank when there should be more emotion. Ashe, the new Crow and his son are, of course murdered for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and end up at the bottom of the sea. Upon the Crow's return he receives help from Sarah to begin his trail of revenge. The triangle here is that while he tries to carry out said revenge, he falls in love with Sarah at the same time, the main evil doer this time around, Judah, plots to do whatever he can to stop Ashe before he gets to him. Iggy Pop makes a wacky appearance as one of Judah's subordinates, Curve, getting to be his usual out of control self, even after all these years. <br /> <br />In the end it's an interesting concept, decent delivery and at times feels too short, as if parts could've been added or explained in more depth, but if your a fan of the series, you should at least give it a chance.
0064471837|3.0|Ok, it's a good book, it really is, but what was there for everyone else, it just wasn't there for me.<br /><br />I think the storyline and idea are completely wonderful and original, how Garth Nix managed to come up with such a story is beyond me.<br /><br />However, the writing may have been very good but to me the characters all seemed a bit two-dimensional. And I felt it was really grey. Not boring, just grey. It lacked that something that makes you fall in love with the world and the characters. The cat creature thing started off as my favourite until it tried to kill Sabriel, which was a good twist to the story and everything but really made me feel very differently about it.<br /><br /> I did like the romance side and I felt like it added another interest without getting in the way or becoming too gushy and sloppy.<br /><br />I'm someone who likes to get completely swept up in a book and wanted to read it because I care about the characters and what will happen to them. With Sabriel I felt I was reading it so I could finish it and start another book. I think I will read the others but I don't have high hopes.<br /><br />If you just want to read something fresh, different and interesting and don't mind dark stories, you should give this a go.<br /><br />Good luck.

B000003TA4|3.0|This album is admittedly overrated. Some people think this is one of the greatest albums ever, and I am not one of them. The only reason I listen to Nirvana is b/c of the absolutely sublime \\"On a Plain\\" and \\"Polly.\\" Those are undoubtedly the best songs of Nirvana's career. Anyway, I haven't really come here to review the album itself. <br /> <br />There is a reviewer named AvrilLavigne#1fan that posted a review on August 7th on this album. He/she says that Kurt Cobain showed Hendrix, Clapton, and BB King how to play and called them \\"useless\\" and \\"posers.\\" Advice for you: Just because you don't understand jack$#it about them doesn't mean you should ever disrespect them the way you just did. If you think Blink 182 and Good Charlotte and all of those mainstream punk groups are talented, you need to get your sorry little a$$ off the couch and out into the real world. You are the reason parents hate teenagers, b/c you don't take your time to actually like the people you senselessly bash. So stop smoking crack and go <br />f**k yourself!!!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Most of the times sequels make you wonder why they make sequels!  They rarely are as good as the original.  However, X2 really not only lives up, I liked it better.  It's a stronger paced film.  The characters are set, so they can move on to the story instead of introduced everything. <br /> <br />Just hard to see Gandalf being a bad boy!  What would Frodo think? <br /> <br />Just great fun and makes you hungry for X3.
B000002H70|5.0|I've loved this album for quite some time now, but after seeing The Cure live for the first time a couple nights ago, I just had to express my love for their music, especially Disintigration, which is widely regarded as their best work. They played six songs off of this album, and the emotion I feel from this album was expanded tremendously from seeing/hearing this incredible band first hand. <br /> <br />There are a couple of songs on this album that I always felt were good, but not great, those being Plainsong and Closedown. However, I now feel that all tracks are outstanding and I can't really think of a flaw in the album. However, tracks 7-11 are particularly breathtaking (as if I had the words to describe fully how I feel about these songs).  <br /> <br />Really, there is nothing I could say that hasn't been said before about the album, just that it has become one of my top 3 of all time favorites and cannot possibly be replaced by anything else. This record evokes more emotion (by far) than any other record I have, and I have a lot. In fact, to some extent, it makes the average rock and roll album (thinking Beatles) seem lifeless and unimportant - seriously, the emotion poured into this album is incredible. To the average person, giving this one listen is not enough. It must be played over and over again over a period of time to let the music soak into your soul, then you'll begin feel the impact that it has had on me.
038551123X|4.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter has all the requisite entertaining page-turner elements: characters you like, characters you don't like, lean story telling, effective plotting, momentum. It's good!  <br /> <br />Plenty of other reviewers have commented on the twist of making a serial killer the detective in this story. The real twist is the exchange of dark humor for the dread that normally infuses novels typical of this genre. I think this makes the book accessible to an audience wider than that of the usual thriller, and perhaps accounts for its success. <br /> <br />The revelation of the mystery killer's identity, which in a lesser writer's hands might have come across as a cheap shot, is engaging and believable. My only complaint is that the final pages have more to do with the creation of a serial (as in \\"to be continued...\\") than of a serial killer. <br />
0385512104|4.0|I bought this book in Heathrow airport to read on the plane, but i only managed to start reading it a few days ago, 2 months after the plane landed and i didnt put it down until it was finished. This book is about a Christopher - a boy with special needs - and while he has many behavioural problems he is really quite normal, it is 'written' by Christopher and sees the world through his eyes as he goes from day to day trying to solve the mystery of who murdered the dog next door.  Over the course of the book Christopher  ventures beyond his little world of home, school and the shop down the road and discovers things about himself and the people who care about him, and you realise that not only christopher but everyone around him has defects. It is a sad and beautiful story which i would recomend to anyone to read. I dont normally read books like this, prefering epic science-fiction novels, but this book has throughly earned a place on my bookshelf.
B000000993|5.0|I first heard this record when it came out in 93'.  Undertow was my introduction to Tool and I must admit that I was far from impressed.  \\"It's all in drop D tuning.  Every song is in the same key!  The mood never changes.\\"  These were my thoughts as the music seemed to drone on and on.  I wrote them off as another boring metal band and threw the tape in the back of my car and forgot about it.   <br /> <br />Yeah, well, I was wrong.  I was very wrong.  Two years later I found the tape and  gleefully rediscovered Tool, wondering how in the world I had dismissed them before.   <br /> <br />Undertow is one of those rare rock records that makes a clear and concise musical statement from start to finish.  The songwriting and the production conspire to create a visceral, sinister mood that is deep in scope and seething with tension.   <br /> <br />For example, listen to the first track, \\"Intolerance.\\"  It begins with twenty seconds of an unidentifiable sucking, bubbling sound effect.  The opening riff in 14/8 (phrased with a bar of 6/8 and a bar of 8/8) is dark and serious, intelligent and determined.  When the verse begins, Maynard's vocal line is a simple four note motive that rhythmically counters the riff.  His voice sounds ghostly, filled with a sincere angst that threatens to break into indignant rage at any moment.  The lyrics are contemplative, intelligent, (dare I say it?) philosophical.  Maynard makes bold and, yet, humble (because of their sceptical nature) ethical assertions about his own intolerance for what he sees as an amoral and irresponsible consumer society.  When he screams \\"You lie, cheat and steal!\\" he really means it.  But he does not ignore his own reluctant role in the perpetuation of this system by his mere connection to it: \\"I am not innocent.  No one is innocent.\\"  I usually don't comment on lyrics, but there is usually not much to comment on.   <br /> <br />For just one example of the simple, yet effective production, pay attention to the flange effect on Danny Carry's cymbols.  It gives the entire track a sizzle and a seething quality that adds a great deal to the overall feel.   <br /> <br />Adam Jones' guitar tone is amazing.  Maynard is one of the best rock singers - period.  Danny Carry is one of the best rock drummers - period.  These compositions are simple but smart and have just as much in common with Stephen Reich as with Black Sabbath.   <br /> <br />The band got better and better and their latest release, Lateralus, is, by far, their best release.  Still, Undertow is a classic and is, in a way, it's own genre.
0790729644|5.0|This motion picture is a realistic look at the way things were.  Gunfights were not fast draw contests out in the street at high noon.  The classic response, when told he had shot an unarmed man, \\"Well, he should have armed himself,\\" is close to the reality of the situation.  The motion picture has excellent acting and deserved academy awards.<br /><br />The motion picture deals with the question of white slavery, i.e., holding women in bondage as prostitutes.  This practice continued into the 20th century.  Their pimp questions how they obtained money to hire gunmen, who are brought in to take vengence on two men they hold responsible for disfiguring one of the women (note that no punishment was meted out to the men, other then making them reimburse the pimp for the value of the woman - an indication of the prevailing attitude).<br /><br />The gunmen are two paid assassins, coming out of retirement to earn some much needed money, plus a young man thinking to make a name for himself.  The story deals with tracking down their assigned targets, executing them (don't expect a fair fight, one gets whacked while sitting in an outhouse), and the aftermath.  Life will not be the same for the survivors, and the Eastwood character rides off into the sunset and back into obscurity.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to study the real west, rather than the make believe usually presented, should watch this motion picture.  It is intended for mature audiences, so I would rate it PG-13.

B00005N5S2|4.0|The 1977 film of MacArthur is worth watching for the towering performance of Gregory Peck as General Douglas MacArthur. Peck considered this one of his favorite roles and fought with the producers over the screenplay and editing of the film -- and fought he should have because those very flaws kept this movie from being a great film. <br /> <br />MacArthur lead a long, dramatic and heroic life during World War I, World War II and the Korean War. As a vain and brilliant military genius who believed in his own destiny, the movie focuses on the decade 1942-1952. The film feels like MacArthur's greatest hits: the set pieces of Bataan, \\"I shall return\\", his rulership of Japan, the Inchon landing in Korea, \\"The Old Soldier\\" speech before Congress and so forth WITHOUT pulling the various scenes together into a coherent whole. According to Peck, the original three hour version fleshed out MacArthur more before it was edited down to the 130 minute commerial version.  <br /> <br />Without prior knowledge of MacArthur's life, the movie would be confusing and lacking in the richness that was MacArthur's life. As one example, the various military situations are dealt with superfical, briefly and often without maps, so that one does not see the strategic brilliance of his Pacific campaigns. I highly recommend reading William Manchester's \\"MacArthur\\" before seeing the film.  <br /> <br />Should you see the movie? Yes, even a MacArthur at half speed is more interesting than most movies and Gregory Peck IS MacArthur. He was passed over for an Oscar nomination although that was interpreted at the time as more of a comment on the film itself than upon his acting. It is worth seeing for Peck's performance in and of itself.
B000002IQ9|4.0|In 1990, Phil Collins was at the apex of his career.   His \\"...But Seriously\\" album was doing enormously well and in my eyes was the best album for that year.   With Phil's career with Genesis, Genesis had a history of doing live albums.   As for Phil's solo career - which was now firmly established, it was time for Phil to release a live album.  Thus the \\"But Seriously\\" Tour was captured on both CD and Video at a performance in Berlin.   If you have seen the video for the concert, this is a top notch performance in which Phil and his band pour an enormous amount of energy for over 2 1/2 hours during the show.   In other words it was really something special.   With the CD, it does miss the mark a bit.  The content that is on the CD is still very good - and will be an enjoyable live album.   However, this CD had the potential to be so much more and it's too bad it fails to do so. <br /> <br />Recently the Progressive Rock Band Rush released their \\"Rush in Rio\\" concert on CD and DVD.   They had intended to only release it on DVD, but they realized they had something 'special' - so they decided to release the audio portion on CD.  The concert was unspoiled on CD and the result is very appealing.   With the \\"Seriously Live\\" video that Phil Collins did, I think it's safe to say that this is something 'special'.   However when the \\"Serious Hits... Live!\\" CD was made, the audio portion was changed somewhat.   For starters only 15 of the 24 songs are included on the CD.  The \\"Serious Hits...Live!\\" CD goes the 'safe' route and really only focuses on Phil's hit songs leaving out great live performances of songs like \\"Colours\\", \\"Hand in Hand\\",  \\"Inside Out\\", and \\"Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore\\".    In addition, the songs are were partially re-ordered compared to how they were done in Berlin.   This is somewhat disappointing because for Berlin,  I think Phil really nailed down the order of the setlist perfectly.  There is no sense of a \\"live concert\\" - no opening song (\\"Hand in Hand\\" the opener is not on the CD) and we're not told that \\"Sussudio\\" is the song that wraps up the main set before the encore.   Finally, this is really a subset of some of the Berlin concert.   What is missing is Phil's communication with the audience (there are some real good moments as he 'reads' German to the crowd).  Also missing is when Phil introduces the band - it's a complete riot.    It's possible that Phil did this to not have the CD and Video in sales competition with each other, but it would have been nice this concert in its entirety  released on a double CD. <br /> <br />Despite some of the shortcomings, \\"Serious Hits...Live!\\" still has some very good live numbers on this CD.  One thing that is good is we get live versions of some of the duets that Phil Collins has done.  The reason that Phil is able to pull off these duets is because he surrounded himself with a top notch set of performers - and in particular for the duets a great set of vocalists.  \\"Separate Lives\\" is a nice duet that Phil Collins did with a singer named Marilyn Martin for the motion picture \\"White Nights\\".   Phil manages to keep the chemistry solid by doing this duet with his female background vocalist - Bridgette Bryant.  In fact I think Bryant does a better version than Martin.   Phil's legendary duet \\"Easy Lover\\" that he did with Earth, Wind, and Fire's Phillip Bailey is covered.   This is actually done as a trio with his male vocalists Arnold McCuller and Fred White.  The trio's version works beautifully and the result is an exciting new spin on the song. <br /> <br />There are several songs included on this CD that really rise to the next level when done live.   I always thought \\"In the Air Tonight\\" was an overrated song (i.e. a good song, but not a great song).   The live version on this collection is awesome.  When you hear Phil crash on the drums just over 4 minutes into the song, you will understand why.  \\"Who Said I Would\\" is a very entertaining song when watched on the video,  the audio portion does not disappoint either.  This is one of those songs that truly is better done live.  Another interesting spin on a classic song is \\"Sussudio\\".  This was a song that was a very good song, but probably was one of the most overplayed songs of the 1980s.  Phil changes up the intro and finale to the song a bit and the result is terrific.  I always thought of \\"Sussudio\\" as more of an opening song, but the version that was done live makes it a perfect song for wrapping up the main set (which Phil did on this Tour).   Live versions of \\"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\\", \\"Against All Odds\\", \\"One More Night\\", and \\"Two Hearts\\" do not disappoint.  Of course, the traditional wrap-up song \\"Take Me Home\\" is included - and in its mantra-like fashion, it is the perfect close to the concert (they do include this as the last track on the CD).   In fact, there really isn't a bad version of any of the 15 tracks included on this CD. <br /> <br />So to sum up, the quality of what is included does exist on this CD.  Pay close attention to the music - Phil's musicians on horns and vocals really shine with Daryl Stuermer's guitar, Leland Sklar's Bass, and Chester Thompson's drums.  Take the title of this CD literally - Serious Hits...Live\\" will mean \\"hits\\" from the \\"..But Seriously\\" tour.  I would get this CD, but also advise getting the video version of the concert to get a true sense of the energy that this performance delivers.

B0000CABJ1|5.0|....never really followed Donna until a few months ago. I'm more into current dance/house music.  However, at a wedding reception, they played 'Last Dance'....well I began exploring her music a little further, and here is the newest release!  I absolutely love it, but then I found the Anthology CD (1993) and it's much better- same material as this release but the edits are longer, plus there's even more of 'the very best' on the Anthology.   <br /> <br />Anyhoo, not a bad buy for $12, I've bought four more albums since this one...Donna's awesome! This release is good for listeners who aren't too familiar with her (like I was)...it's a nice snapshot of her overall music career, and the liner notes and bio inside the cover pretty much give you a nice briefing.  Her 70s music is much better than her 80s stuff....check out her albums \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" \\"Four Seasons of Love\\" and \\"Love Trilogy\\"....makes you want to envision disco balls and everyone packing the dancefloor in their platform shoes and big hair!   <br /> <br />Buy it! I'm collecting everything the woman has done.
B00000294R|3.0|Big L is defiantly one of the dopest mcs that ever touched a Mic. The boy could seriously rap. He produces an album that is strict fire with a great flow and style. He basically uses a free style battle throughout the album. The reason I only gave it 3-1/2 stars are because the production is not up to par at all, as well as the fact the content of Ls lyrics after a couple songs gets extremely repetive and monotous.  <br />Overall 3-1/2 stars I would recommend cd for people who like lyricsits, Chino Xl, Nas, Ras Kass, Canibus.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I think that the third Harry Potter was great! It was so dark, mysterious, and humorous, just like the book! Yeah, they may have changed some things, but you don't find many movies these days that are like there books, what I'm saying is: IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE! But it was GREAT! I LOVED IT!  <br /> <br />As for HP4, Mike Newell should keep it one movie, and up to 3 hours. Two parts would be rediculous! At least up until it was too long as one, but they can make HP 6 and/or HP7 up to 4 hours long, as well as its entertaining...it worked with GONE WITH THE WIND, so why not HP4, 5, 6, or 7? <br /> <br />

Too bad most of the points in this movie were proven incorrect by the bipartisan 9-11 Commission report and the Senate Intellegence Committee and British security report that vindicated Tony Blair.  This is far from a \\"documentary\\", as Moore twists the truth to his liking (ie. the misrepresented and inaccurate newspaper editorial date and headline and the bit about encouraging Congressmens' children to enlist...he cut out the one rep who wanted to help him, because his kid was in Iraq...he was a Republican).<br /><br />Despite the errors, it'll win an Oscar, because that's the way Hollywood is...
051788710X|5.0|To read Conscious Dreaming with an open, attentive mind is to take the first step on the path to self-discovery through dreamwork.  The other nine steps are vividly described by Robert Moss within the book itself.  Extensively researched and full of illuminating examples, one is inspired to try all of the various methods and fun exercises presented so clearly. <br /> <br />The book's tone is accessible and supportive, as the author takes us from the rudiments of dream gathering and journaling to the proper etiquette of sharing dreams with others.  He explains that the use of shamanic drumming to harness our brain's theta waves helps us succeed at active dreaming techniques, such as re-entry, journeying and changing the outcomes of dreams.  (note:  for those who dream, but don't drum, a drumming CD by Robert Moss is now available for purchase.)  We travel and meet our higher selves and spiritual guides with whom we can interact.  Our dreams routinely include the departed.  Robert Moss is clear and precise when he warns of psychic intrusions and how to defend ourselves.  This book obviously goes the entire distance to help prepare the reader for the myriad possibilities of the dreamscape.   <br /> <br />And what can one learn?  Practically anything!  Health issues, soul loss, future selves, ancestor influences, creative thinking, global visioning, romance--the list goes on.  Probably the final step to honor this process would be to bring gifts of healing and hope to the world community, as we each reclaim our soul's purpose.  The goal is no less than that.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I consider myself a conservative independent, even though I'm registered as a Republican.  I went into this movie w/ a fairly open mind.   <br /> <br />It seemed to break out into two major sections.   <br /> <br />1.  The pre-Iraq invasion half was strongly anti-Bush, not that that is a cardinal sin.  But it definitely had a strong 'agenda' feel to it.  In this section of the movie, I found myself thinking through lots of counter-arguments and objections to what was presented.  So while there was much evidence presented, it appeared to have too many holes or alternate explanations to be convincing to me.  Intriguing, yes.  Worth considering, yes.  Convincing?  Not quite.  It at least didn't convince me of Bush being any worse than any other Presidential candidate out there. <br /> <br />2.  The second half was more anti-war than it was anti-Bush.  This was far more compelling to me.  I found myself in tears several times over the horror and tragedy of war.  One of the most compelling statements in the movie was something to the effect of, 'Even if you are not a pacifist, war should be a last, last, last option.  And this was not our last option.'  That's a heavy paraphrase, but that was the general idea.  This didn't have NEARLY the political feel the first half had, and had much less of a propaganda feel to it. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Buy the DVD or at least go see the movie.  It's worth thinking through, considering, and talking about regardless of your political affiliation.
B0001I55SS|5.0|I remember going to see The Black Hole at the drive-in when I was five years old, but I had to wait until I was 28 before I could see it again.  By that time I was an FX gunkie, actually due mostly to seeing this film, and the movie floored me all over again with some of the most incredible film techniques to hit the big screen ever.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this movie is a case of some of the most horrid script-writing you will ever see in sci-fi . . . the only cut I can think of that beats it is the Star Wars Holiday Special (yes, the writing is THAT bad).  But if you are a space fan, or like me watch high-tech movies not to be wowed but to see if you can figure out how it is done, this is a MUST OWN for your collection.  Many of the special effects that have become commonplace in filmmaking were done in this film for the very first time, including the development of a new camera that ended up being used in several shots of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, as well as several films after (as a matter of fact, considering The Black Hole and Star Wars were in production at the same time, you will be shocked at how much better the effects are in The Black Hole; I can't help but think what Star Wars would have been if this crew had worked for Lucas instead).  And the U.S.S. Cygnus is quite simply, in my very humble opinion, the single most gorgeous ship ever.<br /><br />Do NOT pass this one by.  Yes, you will be groaning, but you will also be amazed at what Disney could do before the advent of computer animation.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This is among my very most favorite movies... despite what the critics had to say about it.  It provided plenty of action, commedy, and the music score was second to none.  OK, so the premise is a little odd... but it was at least an imaginative modification of \\"The Frog Prince\\".  This particular \\"frog\\", Emmy, played aptly by Kim Cattral, was an rescued from an unwanted arranged marriage in ancient Egypt, and reincarnated several times over the centuries.  She eventually ends up in 1980's America as a mannequin that no one other than Jonathan, the male lead, can see as a living woman.  She turns back into a mannequin if anyone else looks at her.  It ends up developing into a love story of sorts, and ends... well, I won't give away the entire story.  One item that I found especially noteworthy is that when Emmy is given the precious gift of life, the very first thing she does when she realizes it is to look to Heavens and thank the gods (Emmy was polytheistic remember).  We should all take that attitude when Good Things happen to us.  I guess the polytheistic bend is what got it past the atheistic Hollywood censors.  This is also quite possibly what got the bad reviews.  God forbid that a supreme being be credited for anything!
0345440900|5.0|Beyond great advice and feeling like \\"Finally, someone understands!\\", this book is solely responsible for my son sleeping through the night at 7 weeks.  Whenever anyone tells me I have a great baby, I give all the credit to this book.  EASY--Eat, Activity, Sleep, Your Time is so logical and easy to implement.  Also, Hogg does not believe in the \\"cry it out\\" theory--however, she does put an emphasis on the fact that babies ARE going to cry (and it's okay!). It has made both me and my son much happier!  And, the best part...It only took three days to go from waking every 3-4 hours, to sleeping 8 hrs the first week (7 wks old) and 10-12 hrs now (11 wks old). <br /> <br />In addition to helping us find restful nights, this book outlines and explains many gestures/motions that babies try to communicate with. (Like sticking out their tongue might mean a bit of gas or if you let your baby get away with 3 yawns you could have to deal with the screaming of an overtired child)  I have found that my son cries much less now--mainly because I recognize his needs much more easily.  As a first time mom, I feel like this book explained everything.  It has made me much more confident in myself as a mom and much closer to my child as well. <br /> <br />This book is amazing!  I have already given it to two other new moms.  Reading the Baby Whisperer is like talking to a friend over coffee...Hogg seems to understand everything!
B000002UV1|5.0|My introduction to the Peppers was hearing \\"Stone Cold Bush\\" blaring out of the speakers at a club. I was absolutely gobsmacked by the shear power. To my delight, I discovered that the whole of Mother's Milk has the same explosive energy. Since I bought MM, I've listened to all their albums but it still holds up as their very best. Apart from a rather over-the -top version of Hendrix's \\"Fire\\" and a rather too manic \\"Punk Rock Classic\\", this album is absolutely brilliant.  <br />The best song is definitely \\"Knock Me Down\\" but I also love the hard metal-funk of \\"Stone Cold Bush\\" and the humour of \\"Magic Johnson\\".\\"Good Time Boys\\" is a great anthemic opener. Only the slow funk of \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" indicates where the band were going next- slow'n'sleazy funk which dominates BSSM. <br />Sadly Mother's Milk has proven to be their first and last really great album. I found BSSM to be unbelievably dull in comparison-way too long and with only a handfull of decent songs.What can I say? The general consensus is that BSSM is their all time masterpiece.I disagree.
B000004747|5.0|Because he played multiple instruments at the same time Roland Kirk sometimes got the rap that he was gimmicky.  He was not gimmicky, he was unique. And if you want to discuss single instruments he was a master tenor saxophonist.  \\"Rip, Rig and Panic\\" is one of the most unique and passionate recordings ever made.  (A word of warning: it is not music for those who like their jazz playing quietly in the background.)  Not only do you get Roland at his inventive best, you also get the always fascinating Jaki Byard on piano and the fiery rhythm section of Richard Davis and Elvin Jones.  And the fact that you also get a second Roland Kirk recording, \\"Now Please Don't You Cry, Beautiful Edith,\\" on this CD makes it a doubly appealing purchase for those who want some Kirk in their collections.  While not in the same league as \\"Rip...,\\" \\"...Edith\\" is a fine outing for Kirk, pianist Lonnie Liston Smith, bassist Ronald Boykins, and drummer Grady Tate.  I once had the pleasure of hearing Roland play in person.  He ripped as he does on \\"Rip, Rig and Panic.\\"

THATS BECAUSE SCREAM SET A LANDMARK IN THE HORROR/THRILLER GENRE AND HAS YET EVEN COME CLOSE TO BEING OUTDONE. DIRECTORS KNOW THIS AND THEY ALSO KNOW THAT ANY FILMS IN THE GENRE WILL BE INSTANTLY COMPARED TO THIS MASTERPIECE INSPITE OF HOW LONG AGO IT WAS RELEASED. SCREAM DAZZLED MOVIE FANS WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT THE MODERN FILM HAD FORGOTTEN, BRILLIANT ACTING, A INTELLIGENT PLOT, AND THE BASIC RULE OF NEVER UNDERESTIMATING THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE AUDIENCE.
078401213X|1.0|The name \\"Pi\\" really sold, so I bought the movie. I consider myself having a little-bit-above-average math knowledge, so perhaps that is the reason I bought it. <br /> <br />BUT, I should say I found it a very stupid movie, and I am very surprised for all the positive comments I have found here. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you want to see this movie because of math, don't do it, but if you like extremely bizarre movies, then this is a movie for you.
B00005JM0B|2.0|BEING A FAN OF BOTH OF THE FIRST FILMS, I WAS EXPECTING A LESS THAN POWERFUL EFFORT FROM THE THIRD FILM. PARTICULARY WHEN I HEARD JAMES CAMERON AND EDWARD FURLONG WERENT INVOLVED. LESS THAN POWERFUL WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DISSAPOINTED THE TERMINATOR SERIES FANATICS WERE WITH TERMINATOR 3 AS ITS SO OVERPRODUCED AND BADLY ACTED, FANS ARE BETTER OFF REWATCHING THE FIRST TWO FILMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NICK STAHL AND CLAIRE DANES ARE BOTH CAPABLE ACTORS BUT JONATHAN MOSTOW IS CERTAINLY NOT A CAPABLE DIRECTOR TO HELM SUCH A FRANCHISE. THE SADEST THING IS NOT SO MUCH THE DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE FILM, BUT THE INCREDIBLY LONG WAIT FANS HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO THIS CRUMMY WORL OF BAD PERFORMANCES AND PLOT ERRORS. I WONT EVEN MENTION THE PATHETIC NEW TX TERMINATOR (KNEW THAT WAS A MISTAKE FROM THE BEGINNING)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm so looking forward to the return of the Browncoats (browncoats.serenitymovie.com)in May 2005 when \\"Serenity\\" comes to the big screen, but in the meantime I'm handing out the Firefly series right and left, and leaving converts in my wake.  What a terrific series, and what a shame it ended after only a single season!  I could have enjoyed years more. <br /> <br />You know the plot, so I'll just tell you that Buffy and Angel fans (and doubtless many others) will love this additional glimpse into Joss Whedon's crazed mind.  Lots of quotable quotes (\\"my food is problematic\\"), eye-candy (the incomparable Morena Baccarin and her shuttle lair), and memorable catch-phrases (\\"Shiny!\\") come out of this charming series.  Loved it, loved it, can't wait for more.

B000002LSV|5.0|It is nice to have the greatest hits including their earlier great tracks. I do love their machine gun styled upbeat 80s stuff such as ELIMINATOR and AFTERBURNER but their 70s blues flavored rock is also enjoyable.<br /><br />Until recently I didn't notice that Jimi Jamison of Survivor participated in Eliminator album and their 90s stuff. Yep, he serves as the backing vocal of GIMME ALL YOUR LOVING lending his high-tone vocal. ROUGH BOY is an excellently made power ballad though I am a bit surprised that they do such thing. I really miss STAGES from AFTERBURNER album and original version of LEGS but overall it is nicely made greatest hits package.<br /><br />If you like southern blues rock be sure to have this. And it is enjoyable to 80s rock fans for sure.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Franz Ferdinand is really awesome!  Their CD, Franz Ferdinand, though quite short, is full of great tunes, licks, and lyrics.  I got hooked on this band from the strange elements in their music as well as in their music video.  I still have found no sense in their lyrics. <br />Anyway, some of the best songs on the CD (even though they all rock) are Take Me Out, Darts of Pleasure, 40', and Come On Home.   <br />This is a MUST HAVE CD for indie fans.  I can listen to this CD over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.............. <br />Franz Ferdinand rox my sox!
B00005V9IL|5.0|This is a great movie!  The action is great, the special effects superb, and the music beautiful.   Before I bought this movie, I was doubting. I didn't know if I had to buy it or not, because I had never seen it. But I had seen the trailer and was amazed! So I bought it, and loved it!  First of all, it's James Cameron, you can't go wrong with that. (Yeah okay, only Piranha II is bad, but that was one of his first movies)  Second: It has great actors: Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn (Who plays a great caracter) who all act perfect!    When you see this movie, you will be blown away by the beauty of the sets, special effects and music.  The Aliens in this movie are beautiful made! They are great to look at!    I recommend the special edition of the movie. This version (releashed in 1991)has 25 more minutes and gives everything much more depth.     If you like James Cameron's movies, this will be another classic for you!  A must see!
B0001I55OC|1.0|If I hadn't been on an airplane the first time I saw this junk, I would have walked out.  It's a shame because I thought the book was a good yarn.  Some decisions they made really turned this into an incomprensible mess.  The professor is Scottish yet his son isn't but his coworker is???  The female was dressed as a female unlike the book which in reality would have had unfortunate consequenses with such a rapacious lot.  Also, the point of shooting arrows with a bow is to increase their penetrating power.  There's no way she was going to use arm power to shove that arrow through chain mail with enough force to kill a man.  I suppose the worst thing was the over earnestness of the actors who had to try and take this junk seriously and the way every time a \\"knight\\" was tripped, knocked around or otherwise fooled by the modern folks, they looked like an extra from \\"The Holy Grail.\\"  Another unfortunate comparisome is that that the way they kept yelling \\"Trebouchet!!\\" made it sound like \\"Run Away!\\"  Again from the Grail.  At least the laughs in that movie were intentional.
0375713751|5.0|I'm not a working mother, not a mother at all, but I was able to relate socompletely to Kate.  I'm not in finance either but for once it seemed sort of interesting-- Kate is a hedge fund manager and she has to travel around the world and take phone calls in the middle of the night.  Unlike some other chick lit books (notable the shopaholic books), this heroine is convincingly good at a glamorous-but-demanding job. <br /> <br />But really it's the writing that makes this book.  The plot is not all that original-- there's a good-looking man who is tempting her away from her husband; she is torn between her home and her work-- but Kate is such an appealing heroine and the writing is so vivid that the book speeds along.  I owned this book for awhile before I started it but once I began I couldn't put it down.  It was really a treat. <br /> <br />One of my favorite moments is when her daughter draws a picture of her...she asks her daughter if Mummy is wearing a hat, daughter replies, no it's Mummy's hair, brown on top and yellow on the bottom!  (oops... really need to stop putting off getting those highlights done!) <br /> <br />Despite the jokes and the light-heartedness there are very real things at stake for the character and you share her journey as she struggles to make the right choice.  Whether or not you're married with kids, everyone struggles to find that balance between work and family--to find the proper balance in life. <br /> <br />Overall, really satisfying read!
0140177396|5.0|This really is a perfect story and you should set aside an evening to make sure that later in life, you'll have read it.  It is a perfect drama because the author tells you what happens without reflecting on why or explaining what a character is thinking.  There are no subtexts, red herrings, faints or misqueues.  All the characters act exactly as you'd expect and yet the story still surprises.   <br /> <br />Enjoy
0393057658|4.0|Yet again Michael Lewis takes his readers on an amusing adventure in Moneyball, when he sets on the quest to discover why the Oakland Athletics, despite one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, are perennial contenders. The book is filled with interesting personality profiles and insights into the economics of baseball. Moneyball's main focus is Billy Beane, a former can't miss prospect coming out of high school who never lived up to expectations, but has been one of the most successful general managers in the major leagues during the past several years. The book presents an interesting story of how Beane, along with his assistants and scouts, have discarded taditional beliefs about evaluating talent and have turned to technology and unusual statistics to determine who is most likely to have a successful career. I don't know if Beane's methods are the future of baseball, or like Netscape in Lewis' The New New Thing is merely a fad, but it is innovative and worth learning about either way. This is a well written and insightful book and I would recommend it to fans of Lewis and even more to fans of baseball.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Holy crap, this guy SUCKS! All I want to know is how this dude pulls it off.

0140177396|5.0|One of Steinbeck's greatest stories, Of Mice and Men tells the tragic tale of two ranch hands--the small leader George and his large, retarded friend Lenny--struggling to survive in central California during the depression. While George looks out for the two, Lenny's innocent curiosity and brute strength prevents them from settling in one place or realizing their dream of owning their own farm. It is the type of heart warming story only Steinbeck can write and the realistic description and charged emotion throughout is unbeatable. This is one of my favorite Steinbeck stories because it can be enjoyed with a quick, cursory reading, but there are several other levels to explore within the novella if you choose to spend the time. It is a very short story--perfect for a junior high book report or a relaxing afternoon on the couch. I highly recommend this book.
B0002IU988|4.0|First off: Understand that I rarely give out 5-stars, unless you have truly broken the mold and have complete originality. I will hold at just slightly missing 5-star caliber with Alter Bridge's first release. <br />Alright...So you heard the song 'Open Your Eyes' on the radio and your first reaction was....Ok...just someone else put in to sing like Stapp! <br />You Are So Wrong! <br />Yes, that song reminds of true Creed instrumentally, lyricaly, and in punchline, but the rest of the album is all Kennedy! <br />Mark breaks the mold of Creed  on this one and brings in the old-hat metal solo (as other's reviews have pointed out)! <br />From 'Broken Wings' on down shows you who Kennedy really is, and that this is his work! Not Stapps. I suspecially liked 'Shed My Skin.' <br />I have been a fan of Creed, and I will miss the chemistry with Stapp, but I am also ready to see what these guys do in the near future on upcoming releases. Creed did not dry-out, but the industry would have been harsh on them with future releases when sales would drop as compared to expectations. I think this was a nice parting, but a new beginning! <br />I could definately see Stapp/Kennedy and the other three member's from Creed/Alter Bridge being mature enough in a very adolescent industry to do a song together in the future. <br />I can not wait to hear what Stapp has to offer on his solo! <br />  <br />
B000002JS6|5.0|In 1980 most bands were really crappy since the hair metal [...] had just begun but AC\DC was an exception (their debut album came out in '76 anyway). This album made bands like Twisted Sister and Spinal Tap see what real rock was, even though they never changed. The song 'Back in Black' is a perfect example of why this album is so great and 'Hells Bells' has one of the best intros ever. This is also the first album with Brian Johnson and I think he's even better than Bon Scott. Commercialling doesn't lie here either, this album sold over **16 MILLION** copies worldwide, the only albums I can think of that are around that are Led Zeppelin IV, Nirvana's Nevermind and Metallica's Black Album (The Beatles albums have sold in the the 20 - 30 millions). If you are an AC\DC fan then you should already have this (if not you're a poseur), if you are a hair metal or ounk fan then buy this, it could change your style to heavy metal (hopefully). Just buy it.
B000002UR7|4.0|...But it's the best easily consumable album I've heard in a long time. If you've never listened to Radiohead ever before, and are thinking about substituting it for a Good Charlotte CD or something, then this is a good place to start. If you HAVE listened to Radiohead before, this is going to sound weird because the first time you listen to the album, you'll like all the songs. Or at least, you won't have that look of \\"WTF d00D?!?\\" on your face like you just listened to 'Like Spinning Plates' for the first time.<br /><br />Not to say that it's a bad thing. Even though the songs catch on quicker than usual, they still have a decent lasting effect. If you don't mind easily consumable music and you're into Radiohead, then check this out.
0142000663|3.0|This is an important book, I think, in the history of the American novel.  It tackles firsthand the transience of American life, and the changing roles of labor, government and faith in the twentieth century.  By all means, read this book.<br /><br />However, I don't think this is really as great a novel as its reputation alleges it to be.  I had read someplace that Steinbeck wrote this in 100 days, and I believe that might be true.  The basic outline of a great novel is here-- the characters mesh together well, and the conflicts are clearly outlined.  But it reads like a strong first draft.  The structure of the novel is too simple and brief to justify its weighty conclusions.  The characters never grow beyond types, which takes a lot of the political punch out of the book.  Tom, in particular, never really develops enough as a character to make his eventual departure the powerful moment it should be.<br /><br />It's still a good book.  But compared to Steinbeck's other novels, the characterization and plot structure just seem a bit flat.  In the end, it's sort of a weepy prayer for communism amid some graphic yet empty scenes of American squalor.<br /><br />Historically, this novel is important.  But for those who love the form, its impact might seem a bit hollow.
B000002HNR|5.0|Jim Morrison is god. The house announcer starts the CD off telling people to make aisles and what not. Then The Doors start playing Who Do You Love. And then There is a medley of Alabama song, Backdoor Man, Love Hides, And Five To One. I love The Alabama Song, it is one of the best Doors Songs (covers) ever. I also love how Backdoor Man cuts into it, even though somtimes I wish they'd just play the whole Alabama Song. Jim screaming is real cool. Not too many people did stuff like that in the past. The way he sings this version is cool, he sounds real drunk and like he doesn't care too much about anything. Love Hides sucks. Five To One is real cool. Build Me a Woman is okay. When the Music's Over is a real cool one. It's about sixteen minutes it's real cool. I like how he says something about only guys rushing the stage and that being a New York thing. Close To You is a pretty cool song. Universal Mind is real cool. I love Jim's poetry and there is a lot of it on this CD. That is what I love about it. Petition The Lord With Prayer is cool as hell. It's a good filler. It cuts right into Dead Cats, Dead Rats And Break On Through, which is crazy cool. Celebration Of The Lizard is my favorite part of the CD it has a lot of cool poetry. Lions In The Street which is a poem that is real beautiful. Wake Up is also real cool. It's cool to follow it cause it eventually builds up into Not To Touch The Earth and two other poems that all make sort of a story. You'd have to be in the right mind to catch it. Not To Touch The Earth is a killer song. I'd say it's up there with  Alabama song being one of the best Doors' Songs. This version has a Poem called Names Of The Kingdom and the two together are an orgasm it's great. And then the Doors do an extended version of Soul Kitchen and then it's all over.
1573225517|5.0|If the main character of Rob seems like he goes through typical male problems, it's because he is just that-- a type.  But there's clearly a value in that.  In High Fidelity, we're faced with one of the greatest problems of confessional writing.  I think that the people who can see Rob for what he is, flaws and all, are the last people who need to see it.  People who aren't or never were like Rob at all (non-male, non-single, non 30-something) might see his suffering and confusion as senseless and self-indulgent.  Which it is and it isn't.  Call it the Holden Caulfield syndrome. <br /> <br />Confession of this type is self-indulgent, and, unless you're like that self, you're still going to be mystefied by why Rob does what he does.  Why the obsessive behaviors?  Why the passions which are so strong and so fleeting?  And if you're like Rob, the book is a bitingly witty but bittersweet mirror of aspects of yourself. <br /> <br />The humor from Hornby is great, as always.  The pop culture references will spin the mind of a pop culture junkie from cover to cover.  And, if you can look at the book and see a bit of yourself in it, then maybe you'll have something to think about until you finally grow up.  Personally, I can't wait.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a very refreshing album despite what everyone says. It sounds a bit bluesy (which is something you can't see in much rock now a days. we need blues back!!) it's very beatles like. And there is some glam in it. I think it is a great CD. people just need to pull their heads out their asses. The album starts out with Down, which is okay. not bad nor good, a bit tiring after a while. But when I first heard it I was like \\"this rules\\". Down is followed by Heaven & Hot Rods, which is a fun song that kinda rides it's way to an end. Pruno is another fun song. The guitar verses in between the chorus sound real cool just floating and such with the vocals. Church On Tuesday is a copasedic song that talks about family problems. Sour Girl sounds like a Beatles song to me. It's a cool love song. No Way Out is a real cool song. IT starts out with tribal sounding drums and a trippy guitar strumming, then it sounds like primadonna grunge complaing and then the chorus. The chorus is so cool, Scott's voice sounds cool high pitched and bouncing about. Sex & Violence is a glam rock sounding song that rides itself like a lot of the songs on this CD do. Glide is a real beautiful song that glides itself out. the vocals and the guitars are slow and light and it is all just great and beautiful. I Got You is an alright song that gets boring. MC5 wakes you upfrom the two slower songs. I wonder if it has much to do with Iggy Pop? Atlanta is a ballad of acoustic guitars and strings. It is a very beautiful peiece. In all this is a real great Cd that needs more respect. If people would stop listening to someone elses opinion and stop being naive to this great music, that would be great.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is a definate if you really want to know Nirvana. Most songs on it are the properm ones to start off listening to if you're new to the band. <br /> <br />1. You know you're right (previously unreleased): Really dark song. It is very quiet in the verses but the chorus gets the song really loud. Maybe a bit repetative at the end, but I still love it. 5/5 <br />2. About a girl: Very 60s-like, but a bit harder. This is the only song from the \\"Bleach\\" album which is on this! 4.5/5 <br />3. Been a son: A good song, but I really don't see how this is one of their greatest hits. A bit short too. 4/5 <br />4. Sliver: One of my favourite Nirvana songs. Really catchy, rocking tune, but a little bit repetative at the end too. 5/5 <br />5. Smells like teen spirit: Do I really need to say anything? 5+/5 <br />6. Come as you are: Quite a good song, but it gets old quickly. 3.5/5 <br />7. Lithium: Very soft in the verse and loud in the chorus. This anothet good one. 5/5 <br />8. A great song, but at time it foes get old. Nice drumming though. 4/5 <br />9. Heart-shaped box: A classic. Again, quiet in the verses but loud in the chorus. Sang very emotionally. I love it. 5/5 <br />10. Pennyroyal tea: One of the more catchier tracks they band have done. It's very good, but I prefer the unplugged version (even though it is a bit flawed) 4.5/5 <br />11. Rape me: Starts off like \\"Smells like teen...\\". Good, but it gets old again. 4/5 <br />12. Dumb: One of their more relaxing songs. Agian, I don't really see why this song is ont this cd. 4/5 <br />13. All apologies: Like \\"Dumb\\" but better. A beautiful, relaxing song, which is easily as catchy. 4.5/5 <br />14. The man who sold the world: From the \\"unplugged...\\" cd. All the instruments are really clear and sound great, especially the bass guitar. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />So, that's Nirvana's greatest hits. Most of them are, but I feel one or two aren't and some are missed out. What about \\"Love buzz\\"? That was their first ever released single.\\"About a girl\\" was their only song from the \\"Bleach\\" album which is on this cd. What about \\"Negative creep\\"? Also, \\"Drain you\\" was a favourite among fans. Well, howcome it on the cd? I feel they could of had a few off the \\"Incesticide\\" album, like \\"Aneurysm\\" or \\"Aero Zeppelin\\". One of them could have replaced \\"Been a son\\". And \\"Polly\\", that could have been on this too. <br /> <br />Anyway, still get this for \\"You know you're right\\". And the newcomers this is a definate.
B0002HTZJI|4.0|It's about time the Chili Peppers let loose a live album, and this one was worth the wait.  John and Flea are in top form and exhibit consistantly phenomenal playing and improvisation.  Of the new songs, \\"Rolling Sly Stone,\\" is a keeper and harkens back to Freaky Styley while \\"Leverage of Space\\" maintains the quality of the Peppers' current style.  All of the cover songs are pretty amusing.  If you're in the US, this is more than worth the extra effort and/or money to obtain a copy.<br /><br />The only things that keep me from giving this five stars are:<br />1) While very good, Anthony sound a little too professional to convincingly rock and roll at times (once again John and Flea mostly make up for this<br /><br />2) Chad's drum solo puts images of Spinal Tap into my head; the rest of his playing is top-notch.<br /><br />3) Why are there no older songs?  Mother's Milk deserves a nod or two if nothing else.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album shortly after it came out in 97, and loved it then and love it even more now. Not only is this in my opinion Radiohead's finest album, it has to be considered among the greatest of all time. You know the old question asking if you were stranded on a desert island and you could only bring 5 albums with you, which would you consider? Well out of my 800+ albums from many differant artists and genres, I simply could not live without this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have never buy any CD's from rock bands. But then everybody's was talking about Evanescence, which made me curious of listening to them, so I go to a site and listen to couple of their song, and decided that they really know how to rock. But I didn't buy their CD until I put them on the end of my list, but then I got it now, and decided they are really good. Their CD, is basically rock, like many people should have know. The beats are really catchy, and the lyrics are 9 out of 11 songs about dying...I wonder if other rock bands does the same thing...but the lyrics are really meaningful...I just wonder if Amy Lee or Ben Moody, who wrote the songs ever experience it, because every song is about the last moment you'll say while dying or about to die. But the songs still rock. I think Amy Lee has a really strong voice. I have never heard a female's voice that is that strong. And it makes the song really catchy. So anyway, I think that the people should pick their fave rock band carefully, because this is the best rock band ever! So anyway, here's the rating for each song.<br /><br />1. Going Under- 10/10 A song about...dying? Well the lyrics rock and beats are really good.<br /><br />2. Bring me to Life- 10/10 Isn't this song from Daredevil? Well I think this song really rock.<br /><br />3. Everybody's Fool- 10/10 I think this song is the out of 2 songs that's not about dying...and the beats and lyrics rocks too!<br /><br />4. My Immortal- 10/10 I think this song is a single from the Evanescence, and is kinda about love, how much this person's suffer, and kinda about dying...but living immortal though. It's good. It's a slow song.<br /><br />5. Haunted- 9/10 The lyrics are a bit confusing but the music is like...haunted...<br /><br />6.

My Last breath- 10/10 This song's beat is really good, and the lyrics, even though it is about dying again, is really meaningful somehow.<br /><br />11. Whisper- 7/10 The longest song on this album. The beats are kinda cool.<br /><br />12. My Immortal (Remix)- 9/10 I don't know if this song is in every CD, but this is a remix, and it has beats on this one, but I liked the original one more.<br /><br />Oh, and for the people who don't know, Amy Lee, the girl on the cover is the lead singer.accompany by piano.  <br />10.

B0002EXH4K|5.0|When I heard that Dave Mustain was planning on remastering and remixing the Megadeth albums, I was unsure about it at first. But when they came out I \\"rebought\\" Countdown to Extinction and Rust in Peace. At first I didn't like it. Especially on the Countdown to Extintion album, any true Megadeth fan would notice many subtle differances right away. I didn't really feel the changes were completely necessary at first, aside from what was done to \\"This Was My Life.\\"  But when I listened to the album a second time through, I realized how much more crisp the sound was and started to appreciate the differances. I don't think this album was made any better because of the changes, but they certainly don't take away from it, and the extras don't hurt either. Bottom line: not a completly necessary buy, but well worth it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Still the best Radiohead CD ever. This stands as one of the masterpieces of the 90's.  Paranoid Android sounds like a number of songs welded together and yet they are so beautiful that they fit together seamlessly. Subterranean Homesick Alien is a beautiful piece of writing that reaches it's highlight with the line &quot;I'd tell all my friends, but they'd never believe me, they'd think that I've finally lost it completely.&quot;  Let Down, Karma Police and the gorgeous No Surprises are other highlights. However the entire album is wonderful, although you may find yourself skipping over &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; as you become more familiar with the album. Wonderful piece of work the band has not (and likely will not) match.
B0002DB52M|1.0|i watched maybe 20 min. of this boring spectacle and realized that once again i bought a lemon..this is not a true movie but   more like a play that was filmed..it all takes place on a stage..i can't even say that it's worth a rental,it has an amazing roster of a-list hollywood cast including nicole kidman but don't be fooled this is really bad.
B000286RKW|5.0|(I've rearranged this review in descending chronological order to make it easier for people who are looking for information on the most recent Blu-ray edition of the film.)  **UPDATE No. 2 - 6/16/2015**  &#34;I don't care if they come out with the deluxe 25th Anniversary 3D Super-BluRay Scratch 'n Sniff Edition, I'm not biting.&#34; --Me, 2010  Well hello again, folks, I guess it's time to eat my words. I was going to abstain from buying this new 25th Anniversary release, I really, really was. But then the rumors started. A new remastering of the film personally supervised by Martin Scorsese. A freshly remastered DTS-HD audio track. An anniversary screening at the Tribeca Film Festival to show off the movie's facelift. I scoffed. I grumbled.  And boy, was I wrong to do so.  This is the presentation of the film cinephiles have been wanting for years. Warner Brothers has produced a superlative Blu-ray (the original iconic poster design is gone and replaced by a garishly colored new cover, but we've seen the original plenty), spread over two discs to preserve picture quality (movie on disc one, extras on disc two). Included in the package is a nice booklet with production stills, an essay by Mr. Scorsese, and instructions on how to redeem the Ultraviolet Digital Copy (which I've always found needlessly complicated, but that's an issue for another review).  The original negative has been scanned in at 4K for this release-- don't worry if you don't know what any of that stuff means, just know that this is the best Goodfellas has ever looked. Details and colors pop like never before. (And personal pet peeve addressed, that stupid line running down Robert DeNiro's face during the scene at Henry's girlfriend's apartment is GONE.) Even better is the new DTS-HD surround track; after years of suffering through the same slightly modified Dolby 5.1 track, the audio brings the film to life like never before. When Henry whirls Karen through the kitchen of the Copa, you'll swear you were walking in there with them amidst the clattering pans and clinking dishes, the Crystals' &#34;Then He Kissed Me&#34; hovering above it all. It's *that* good.  As for the extras, there's only one new one of note, but it's a goodie, directed by Brett Ratner of all people: &#34;Scorsese's Goodfellas&#34;, a half-hour look back at the film containing new interviews with some of the key players (still no Joe Pesci, though, unfortunately). All other extras are ported over from the earlier releases, including:  -Cast & crew &#34;scene specific&#34; commentary -Henry Hill & Ed McDonald commentary -Original 30 min. &#34;Making Of' Documentary from 2004 Special Edition DVD -Interviews with filmmakers influenced by Goodfellas (13 min.) -Storyboard comparisons -Cast & crew anecdotes -Warner Bros. gangster film documentary -&#34;Looney Tunes&#34; gangster-themed cartoons  I can honestly say that this is the version of Goodfellas I've been waiting for, and I'm proud to eat crow on this one. After all this time, I can finally bump this one up to an easy five stars. Good job, Warners!  (See the original entries below for some thoughts on the film and a more extensive breakdown of some of the extras available on earlier releases. Thanks for reading!)  **UPDATE - 12/31/2010** Having recently gotten a PS3, I've been going nuts updating as many of my DVDs as possible to Blu-Ray, but like most people who've made the switch, I've come to learn that it's not always worth it in every case. I just got the new 20th Anniversary Edition Goodfellas BluRay and I can confirm that it has the same exact lame special features we were issued on the so-called &#34;special&#34; edition DVD six years ago (with two &#34;new&#34; extras; more on that in a minute).  The image upgrade is noticeable to me, but not impressive enough (that line is STILL running down De Niro's face) for me to recommend laying out yet another 20-odd dollars for the same product. C'mon, Warners, all this time and you stillhaven't learned your lesson? And being that this is Blu-Ray, maybe a TrueHD audio track would be in order? Nope, we get the same old 5.1. Thanks a pantload.  So what's new on this 20th Anniversary release? Well, I'll admit it does have a snazzy hardbound book-shaped case, even if it doesn't have much in common with the film, design-wise. There's also a pretty nice booklet about 30 pages long with stills from the movie. There are also two additional features that weren't present on the original DVD: a documentary on the history of the '30s and '40s gangster movies and a selection of mob-themed Looney Tunes shorts. The problem is, this is recycled content; the cartoons can be found in the Looney Tunes sets, while the documentary is a leftover from a Warner Brothers gangster movie box set released a few years ago. They're both fun, both interesting, but have only the most tenuous connections with Goodfellas. Couldn't squeeze one substantial new extra out of this new release, could they? Once again, all people wanted was a little decent treatment given to one of the best movies ever produced by a major studio. Once again, Warner Brothers has proven they just don't get it. Fair enough, but this is the last copy of Goodfellas I buy. I don't care if they come out with the deluxe 25th Anniversary 3D Super-BluRay Scratch 'n Sniff Edition, I'm not biting.  On a side note, I just want to say thanks to everybody for all the helpful votes and whatnot, glad you found this review useful over time. Take care!  **ORIGINAL 2004 REVIEW** There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about &#34;Goodfellas&#34;... it's one of the best movies ever. To hell with the AFI, this is arguably one of the top 10 American movies ever made! Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco: five top-notch talents operating on all 8 cylinders in this story about three decades of life in the mob.  Now, you'd think that Warner Brothers would give this movie the most complete Warner DVD release that's ever existed. A fervent popular following, a high level of anticipation for a special edition, and the current booming state of the DVD industry should've made this a no-brainer slam dunk for Warner's marketing and home video departments. And so, after years of having to flip over the old disc, after years of almost crushing that flimsy snap case, after years of listening to that 5.1 surround that sounded suspiciously like 2-channel, should you get this new version?? The answer is a resounding...&#34;maybe&#34;.  Arguably the biggest plus to this new edition of &#34;Goodfellas&#34; is the fact that the whole movie is contained on a single side of a dual-layered disc. The &#34;all-new digital transfer&#34;, enhanced for 16:9, is only a marginal improvement over the original release (which was also listed as being &#34;enhanced for widescreen TVs&#34; on the package; it wasn't). Strangely enough, in the scene where Jimmy (De Niro) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino) go to convince Henry to go home to Karen, there is a very noticeable screen-split line on the film that sections De Niro's face in half. This isn't the transfer's problem, per se; it looks more like something off the film print. The strange thing is I don't remember this streak being present on the old version. Maybe it's only a minor peeve, but still, this is the kind of thing you'd expect a studio to clean up for a special edition.  The English audio is the same old Dolby-Surround-masquerading-as-5.1 mix used in the old version. The package incorrectly lists Spanish as the alternate language; it's still French. Nothing more to say about that.  The disc menus are static, and they all have this generic-sounding jazz score playing over them. Remember all the jazz in &#34;Goodfellas&#34;? Yeah, me neither.  Of course, the real reason most people are running out to get this new set is to see the special features. This DVD includes 2 commentaries: one with various cast & crew members, the other with Henry Hill & ex-FBI agent Ed McDonald (who plays himself at the end of the movie). Of the 2 commentaries, the track with real-life players Hill and McDonald is infinitely more interesting, even though Hill mumbles more than Keith Richards having an acid flashback. When I bought this set, I was looking forward to some feature-length Scorsese, Pesci, Liotta &/or Bracco commentary (I didn't dare to hope for Robert De Niro, I mean, be serious), with some funny stories or moviemaking info. Instead, what you get is a few new comments cobbled together with 10-15 year old sound bites from De Niro and Joe Pesci. Basically, the first 90 minutes of commentary is a total strokefest (&#34;oh-this-guy-was-so-great&#34;, &#34;oh-she-did-a-really-good-job&#34;) with only Scorsese, author Nick Pileggi, Liotta, and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus saving it. It picks up towards the end, though, when Lorraine Bracco (who shoots down the &#34;screen-specific commentary&#34; illusion when she talks about having watched the movie on the morning she's being interviewed) and editor Thelma Schoonmaker drop some funny thoughts.  As for the rest of the extras? There's really no need to have a second disc to contain them; the total running time of all the &#34;documentaries&#34;, as Warner calls them (&#34;featurettes&#34;, I call 'em), along with the theatrical trailer is less than an hour. Plenty of room for these on the first disc, but then I guess Warner felt they needed another selling point with the whole 2-disc thing. To summarize the 1/2-hour making-of documentary: &#34;Martin Scorsese is a great director.&#34; Remember those 6 words and everything else is cream cheese. The second major documentary, at around 13 minutes long, has interviews with some younger writer-directors who've found themselves influenced by &#34;Goodfellas&#34;. Only 5 words to remember this time: &#34;'Goodfellas' is a brilliant movie.&#34; The other two featurettes are about 10 minutes altogether.One is a storyboard-to-screen comparison, the other is a little throwaway piece with some cast & crew anecdotes. 4 words will do this one just fine: &#34;Warner Brothers is lazy.&#34;  It's really a shame that Warner Brothers couldn't wait just a tad longer and include some truly special features for one of the best movies their studio has ever produced. With the stellar jobs they've done on their other 2-disc reissues, like &#34;Enter the Dragon&#34;, &#34;The Right Stuff&#34;, &#34;Singin' in the Rain&#34; --jeez, even &#34;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&#34; has better features than this!!-- I expected Warner Bros. to really pull out all the stops for this new edition of &#34;Goodfellas&#34;, but it's a big letdown. Still, it is an improvement (no matter how minor) over the previous release, and as it is probably the &#34;best&#34; version we're ever gonna get on DVD, I would have to recommend picking it up.  However, if you already own the movie, keep three things in mind. Ask yourself 1.) if you really mind flipping the old disc over, 2.) if you've got a normal full-screen TV, do you really need a new anamorphic transfer?, and 3.) do you really need to see the special features if they're not exactly top quality? If your answer to any of these things is &#34;no&#34;, then I'd think long and hard about shelling out another $20.
0061015725|1.0|A subpar effort, not nearly as good as Crichton's earlier work (Sphere, Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park).  The characters are one-dimensional, poorly developed when developed at all.  The premise of nanotechnology is a fascinating one, and ripe for science fiction, but not particularly believable as forced into the \\"technological boogeyman\\" role in this novel.  It seems to me now that Crichton has built a large audience, his works are becoming more cookie-cutter and predictable, written with the inevitable blockbuster movie version in mind. <br /> <br />For a much more imaginative, well-written, and believable look at how nanotechnology might shape the world of the future, and a great story to boot, I recommend Neal Stephenson's \\"The Diamond Age.\\"
0156027321|5.0|If you are wondering how can someone write an amazing novel about a kid alone on a boat with a 'friend', then you'll love it. Gets you hooked like very few books can.<br /><br />If you are not the inner-activity, emotionally-tunable type, then get something else :-)
B000002LKF|5.0|This CD is fascinating. It leans far away from the radio-friendly cross-genre pop of Graceland into uncharted territory. The songwriting on this album is amazing. Complex arrangements and orchestrations synthesizing timbre, rhythm, and genre make this album one of those that EVERY time you listen to it, you hear something new. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Graceland is genius. This CD however is much deeper and much more powerful. It works cohesively as a record - flowing from one song to the next. It is underrated how tight the songs work within the framework of the album. This album mixes Brazilian and Afro-cuban elements - NOT simply just \\"African\\" music - with sublime ambient rock with supreme song and lyricism to create a sound totally unique. <br /> <br />Do yourself a huge favor and buy this CD. It is masterfully performed and produced, and it shows how Simon can easily be called one of the greatest songwriting geniuses of the 20th century.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie was absolutely excellent. It couldn't have been better. I was almost always scared, because the zombie people were absolutely excellent. What also really got to me, is that this could be happening right now! Someone could be making a new product in the lab, and if the chemical is lethal, this could happen. <br />I watched this movie, expecting it to be really unbelievable, because most zombie movies are (I find), but they were pretty believable, because they look just like normal humans, except for there eyes, and teeth(except a couple of their faces are mangled from dying). <br />I reccommend seeing this movie if you love to be scared, but I suggest seeing it when you're not alone, or else during the day.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Having missed this in it's cinematic release I was eagerly looking forward to finally seeing it on DVD, what a crushing disappointment. I thought we had moved on from the portrayal of foreigners as funny because they speak English with an accent and I found the scene with the woman in Murray's room all but incomprehensible (was it meant to be funny??). <br /> <br /> Yes it was boring in that almost nothing happens but that can be the making of some films set in boring provincial places, but, and here is the point, the film is set in one of the most lively fascinating and down right crazy places on earth. The idea of a fabulously weathly film star and an intelligent Yale philosophy graduate having nothing to do but mope about in a hotel room all day and then go to the hotel bar at night is plain stupid.  <br /> <br /> I am yet again depressed at how Holywood treats a foreign land as just a canvas to spread out the neuroses of uninteresting Americans going through self-imposed crises, why set this film in Tokyo if all you are going to do is ridicule it. Mr Baseball was more sympathetic to its' subject matter than this film. <br /> <br /> By the way I have stayed at the Park Hyatt hotel in Tokyo and it is fantastic, also, ironically, it has the best American restaurant in Tokyo, just next to the bar which features so heavily in the movie.
B0000399WI|4.0|I watched \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and found it to be an inspiring movie. The movie, however, appears to me to be inspired from the story \\"God Sees the Truth but Waits\\" written by the great Russian author Leo Tolstoy which has a much cleaner plot and which aims at transforming the enemy rather than seeking revenge. Those who have watched the movie must also read the story mentioned above.
B00000F2M4|5.0|This documentary captures Sting at his finest.  The guy with the same name appearing in hip-hop videos and selling jaguars should take a moment and revisit this moment in time.  Oh, if Sting back in 1985 could see how his life turns out....the opinionated, angry young man becomes a pop star?!  his younger self would probably rather jump off the thames and drown.  Great performances by some of the finest musicians ever assembled.  Honorable mention goes to Miles Copeland, stings longtime manager for complementing his rather reserved, english demeanor with good old american swagger and for reminding everyone who's in charge.  (the scene involving the dress rehearsal and the ensuing argument regarding the band's wardrobe is quite entertaining)
B00026W82U|5.0|Biography, written on the KINGS OF CONVENIENCE homepage starts with a phrase :\\"Late nights by the window.\\" And later it describes a house in a Norwegian town, not anything fancy, but simple and common. And it says: \\"it was in the old, white house, on the bench just by the window, that ERLEND and EIRIK for the first time hit these thoughtful mellow sound; the quiet quitar harmonies and substantial lyrics that later would become their trademark as aknowledged songwriters.\\" Thoughtful mellow sound, the quiet quitar harmonies. Enough said. <br /> <br />The world of KINGS OF CONVENIENCE is not fancy and bragging but simple and beautiful. You can't find big bright hits here, but a mellow, pleasant flow. The album is not anything, that you will notice first among your cd-s, but the world on KINGS OF CONVENIENCE is beautiful-beautiful, when you get into it! It's kind and warm. <br /> <br />The biography on the page ends as: \\"... drinking tea, making songs that makes the world stop and listen.\\"

B00005R2M3|4.0|With the release of Shakira's first English album, I find myself wondering how many other hugely talented Spanish musicians there are out there whom I'm missing out on. Not only did Shakira write all the songs on 'Laundry Service', she also produced the entire album. What surprised me after purchasing 'Laundry Service' was the fact that I actually really enjoyed its four Spanish tracks. I was also surprised at Shakira's talent for writing English lyrics. True, they are not amazing or flawless, but she is writing in a second language. I can barely form complete sentences in French or Spanish, let alone write song lyrics. I trust her Spanish albums are much deeper and she wears more of her heart on her sleeve, but I expect that, with practice, hopefully any future English albums will be just as meaningful. I look forward to watching Shakira grow into her second language skills, and hopefully she'll release another English album, awing us all with amazing development. <br /> <br />The album opens with the up-beat dancing track, 'Objection (Tango)'. I've loved this song since the very first time I heard it. It's a very fun and energetic song basically telling off a guy who pays more attention to another girl, rather than Shakira. It's too bad the video for it is terrible. The second track is the beautiful ballad, 'Underneath Your Clothes'. From the very first line of this song (\\"You're a song/Written by the hands above...\\") I was hooked. It's lyrics are sweet, and You can't help but fall in love with this song. The third track, and first single, to drop from 'Laundry Service' is the up-tempo 'Whenever, Wherever'. Despite the fact that it was so overplayed, I'm still not sick of it. I must say, that's quite a feat. This was a great choice for the first single, and I'll bet it surprised people when 'Underneath Your Clothes' also happened to be a big hit, knocking the presumed title of \\"One Hit Wonder\\" off the end of Shakira's name.  <br /> <br />One of my favourite songsoff of 'Laundry Service' is the fun 'Rules'. It's an up-beat, humorous track, stating that if her man wants to be with her, he has to be sure to follow all the rules she's laid out for him. These rules include only laughing if he's laughing with her and only crying if he's crying for her. Shakira also never fails to mention that he's condemned to her. I was actually surprised that this one wasn't released as a single, as I prefer it to 'The One'. Speak of the devil, the fifth track on the album is 'The One'. This was the fourth single to drop from Shakira's English debut. This is a mid-tempo love song with sugary sweet, romantic lyrics (\\"You're the one I need/The way back home is always long/But if you're close to me I'm holding on\\"). 'Ready For The Good Times' is a very energetic, up-beat track. I love the music on this one, and lyrically it's great too. The title basically explains the theme of the track, Shakira wastes no time in telling listeners that she doesn't want to sit back \\"watching other people live/Frozen by the fear to fail\\".  <br /> <br />'Fool' is one of the best songs off of 'Laundry Service'. Lyrically, it's about Shakira not being able to help liking a man who doesn't like her back. It's a mid-tempo track and Shakira's voice sounds amazing on it. The first Spanish track on the album is 'Te Dejo Madrid'. Unfortunately, I don't own a Spanish-English dictionary, so I have no idea what she's singing about. Nonetheless, I absolutely adore the up-beat energy it's full of. This is one of the best tracks on the album. I completely love 'Poem to a Horse'. It has a great up-beat tune, and the lyrics are fabulous as well. There's only one mention of reading poems to the horse which occurs in the lines \\"What's the point of wasting all my words/If it's just the same or even worse/Than reading poems to a horse\\"). The second Spanish track on the album is the mid-tempo 'Que Me Quedes Tu'. Again, I have no idea what the lyrics are, but I don't mind it at all (thisis coming from someone who figured she would have to skip all the Spanish songs). Shakira's voice sounds beautiful, very emotionally driven and sweet.  <br /> <br />'Eyes Like Yours' is one of the best songs on the album. It was one of Shakira's Spanish hits, and she rewrote the lyrics in English for 'Laundry Service'. She sounds amazing on this version, and I love the lyrics, so she must sound even better on the Spanish version, and the lyrics must be flawless. The twelfth track on the album is 'Suerte'. It's the Spanish version of 'Whenever, Wherever'. I suppose that if you spoke Spanish, you would probably prefer it to the English version (because artists always seem to sound better in their mother tongue), but I prefer English simply because I'm able to sing along with the words without stumbling over myself. Following in the same footsteps as 'Suerte', 'Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)' is the Spanish version of the English 'Objection (Tango)'. Once again, the Spanish version is probably better, but my lack of bilingualism still sways me towards the English version. <br /> <br />The only thing really keeping Shakira's album from being unbelievably amazing is her lack of practice in writing English lyrics. Hopefully she will make another English record, and will then proceed to (optimistically) dazzle all of us listeners with her writing skills. Until then, I most definitely recommend 'Laundry Service' to all fans of energetic dance music.  <br /> <br />THE FINAL VERDICT: 85%
B00005JMUA|4.0|(I edited this review after years of seeing and re-seeing KILL BILL2. I realized   I enjoyed/appreciated more and more of it through my many viewings. If I wasn't so  embarrassed I would have given it five stars. Maybe I'll come back (yet again) and   give it a few more stars. Sorry, Mr. T)        With all the praise, I had to review KB2 twice. First time I thought I might have been   in a bad mood; nothing seemed right. So, seeing it again, I saw the same bin of cronyism,   deleted scenes stitched together, ambling dialogue that went nowhere and somnambulant non-acting.     I loved KB1, so this movie seemed a mush of outtakes was disappointing. I imagine the QT crew   deleting scenes then saying \\"Hey, let's cut out the lame parts, then make them into a Vol.2\\"   so's we can make a buck or so more. So they did.    QT certainly is a formidable talent; but in a terminal-adolescent yet   smart way way. Which is why his stream of movies run so hot and cold.    Movie lover that I am, I'll now go see KB2 yet again. Maybe I'll change my review; but I don't think so...
0316666343|1.0|I HATED this book!!  I was so eager to read it from different people's opinion of it.  I read it and was SO disappointed!  The description's went on and on.

It would skip gaps of life and then all of a sudden, something different would start happening.  Didn't like it at ALL!!!!
6305090564|3.0|Soggy high-concept monster / action movie about a team of goons that have been hired to stage an attack and robbery on an enormous, luxurious ocean liner - and get picked off one at a time by the creature that has already made mincemeat of the passengers and crew. <br /> <br />Yes - it's unoriginal and reminiscent of other movies.  Yes - it seems to alternate too much between being serious and being campy.  Yes - I think that Kevin J. O'Connor is one of the major liabilities of the film.  His comic relief and grating, nasal voice have a fingernails-on-the-blackboard sort of aggravation factor. <br /> <br />Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I think that \\"Deep Rising\\" is fun for anybody who enjoys this kind of thing and doesn't demand a whole lot out of their entertainment.  It's very slick, sometimes actually fairly suspenseful, and incredibly gory.  The creature itself is not as impressive; it is entirely animated and looks cheesy - and when you finally see it in all of its true gruesome glory, you may be unimpressed as I was - it does not represent veteran effects master Rob Bottin's best work. <br /> <br />Cast is variable - Treat Williams is not someone you might think of a lead for this kind of film, but it IS essentially a B-movie with an A-level budget, and much of Williams' work over the last several years HAS been of the B-movie variety.  Famke Janssen is sexy and reasonably appealing, and Anthony Heald, Jason Flemyng, Wes Studi and Djimon Hounsou play good slimeballs. <br /> <br />Overall, I genuinely enjoy the movie - I would give it four out of five, but the DVD, made by one of several companies that seem to have no respect for their older features, is sorely lacking in extras, getting just a fair two out of five.  I give the whole thing, therefore, three out of five.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Listen, for all you complaining that this CD is missing some of YOUR favorite songs from guns N roses, consider this, this is a greatest hits album, which means that these songs are the ones that did the best w/ all the public and they were all chart-toppers, it's not a BEST OF album and theirs definately a difference, and if your favorite songs arent on here and you have to complain about it, go buy all the other albums and also, if you already have all their other CDs, no point in buying this one! But, this is an awesome CD and if you are a guns N roses fan but you dont have any of their CDs...definately go out and buy this one...RIGHT NOW!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park's latest CD effort is an excellent but flawed CD.  <br />Browsing through the songs, you might see why. <br />1. Foreword (Not a song so not rated) <br />2. Don't Stay (8/10) The first song on the CD is strong with good vocals and guitar. It sets the tone for the rest of the album. <br />3. Somewhere I Belong (10/10) One of the best songs on the album. Not only are the vocals and music good, but the lyrics don't focus on an old or current hated love, like about 8 of the other songs on the CD. <br />4. Lying from you (6/10) I didn't like this song because I hate it when Mike raps. He needs to stick to guitar and let Chester do the vocals, because he ruins a good beat with his monotone voice. <br />5. Hit the floor (8/10) One of the few songs when Mike takes lead vocals that actually turns out ok. The synth mix in this song is strong and the vocals aren't overly plain. <br />6. Easier to run (10/10) the best song on the CD with powerful lyrics and strong music/vocals.  <br />7. Faint (7/10) A good song that was one of the album's five singles. Very popular but also sounds very similar to several previous LP songs. <br />8. Figure .09 (9/10) Following with the repetetiveness of the CD lyric wise, this song still rocks. Great chorus on this one. <br />9. Breaking the habit (10/10) The most recent single off the CD is a great song that is perhaps the most unusual. The fast dance beat has almost no heavy guitar, and it works well because it is unexpected and great by itself.  <br />10. From the inside (7/10) I wasn't thrilled by this song, it was more of the same and sounded very similar to Hit the floor <br />11. Nobody's Listening (6/10) For God's sake, someone send a memo to Mike: \\"YOU CAN NOT RAP!!!\\" This useless song has no right to be on the CD and wouldn't have been more than a 3 had it not been for Chester's decent chorus.  <br />12. Session (8/10) Fine I guess, but why didn't the band make a full song on here? <br />13: Numb (9/10) A good song that sounds too similar to 'Crawling' to get a perfect 10. Strong nonetheless. A good way to close out the CD <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, Most songs were very good, however, Mike's raps and a huge repetetiveness of lyrics bring this one down from a perfect 5. Still worth a buy depsite it's flaws.
0765301598|4.0|These books were great.  Are they as good as the original dune books?  On the whole, no, but this isn't a case of one writer losing his voice, rather it's two wrtiers who have done a genuinely good job of piecing together the remnants of an awesome storyline.  Buy this book, but accept it for what it is: a son trying to finish his father's masterpiece.
B00006879E|4.0|When I saw the videos on MTV for \\"This Love\\" and \\"She Will Be Loved\\", I was annoyed by how much the lead singer is obsessed w/ sex. That's all he ever does in his video. But then I gave the songs a listen minus the videos and liked them a whole lot more. But overplaying on the radio kinda made me lose my liking for them, hence the 4 stars. But I still recommend this album for ppl who like R&B and rock.
B00008IHN1|5.0|For a while this movie sat on the DVD shelves of the rental store while I past by it numerous times.  I finally got it yesterday and now wished I'd seen it earlier.  It's really good and while the topic may seem/sound boring, it actually wasn't.  I love Nick Cannon (quite cute) and he acted well.  Go see this and you'll tap away at all the drum scenes.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Okay...I rented the movie and it was due back the next day, however I kept it for three days. At first I kept it because of Elisha (lets face it her facial expressions alone sell the movie, come'on Matthew just kiss her already) then every time I watched it the movie, it got better and better. If you watch a trivia feature with the movie (that is accessable in the extras) the movie makes more sense...than just the teen sex comedy that it's made out to be. A camera man, holding condoms, winks at a fellow teen who fails to be \\"firm\\" in the library and your left thinking he's probably gay. Watch the trivia with it and you realize the director is saying just protect yourselves. There's alot of hidden messages in the film from safe sex disclaimers to \\"Platoon\\" references. Elisha is adorable, Emile is a classic born again rebel, Eli becomes less obnoxious and Tim Olyphant character is more understandable in his position of how he can't be a nice guy about the love interest between Matthew and Danielle. Who wouldn't love to have a chance to kiss a beauty like Danielle at a party that they don't really belong out? Just to break out of your shell. Matthew and Danielle give great motivation to any teen who debates with themselves daily on the - could of, would of, should've of - times in life. The movie is GREAT, \\"go with it!\\"
630469654X|5.0|I saw this movie by accident because I would not normally seek out a fantasy; I'm glad I did. It captured my imagination in a thoroughly delightful way. <br /> <br />It's been a while since I've seen Ladyhawke, so I really can't remember the musical score which so many others complain about -- their complaints may be quite valid, but it does not detract from my memories of the film. <br /> <br />The theme of star-crossed lovers is as old as story telling, but it never goes away because it just keeps on working.  The device used by this story to tell the tale is mystically enchanting.  The drama of the rising and setting sun becomes a powerful metaphor. <br /> <br />These days there are too many movies that fall flat because underlying the superficialities of special effects, there is: Nothing.  These films are quickly and readily assigned to the dust bin of your consciousness. <br /> <br />Ladyhawke is a completely charming story of enchantment that will engage your mind and your heart.  That is why I remember it, and why I recommend it.
0743454529|5.0|I am usually not a big fan of fiction, but I absolutely loved this book.  I was unable to put it down, resulting in several late night reading sessions that lasted until 6am or later.  Not only was the book thought-provoking, it was educational.  I learned a lot about leukemia and it clued me in on more of what it must be like to be faced with this horrible illness.  It made me think about what I would do in each of the character's places.  Picoult made the characters very real, the dialogue and internal thoughts of the characters were fantastic.<br /><br />I was quite surprised by the end; usually I can see an end coming a mile away and am often right about what will happen.  I was way off on this one.  My one complaint is that there wasn't nearly enough information or attention paid to the events at the end - it was just like a bomb dropped on you and then the mess was swept under the rug like it was no big thing.<br /><br />All in all I loved this book and highly recommend it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|\\"Don't be fooled, Michael Moore has a pure Anti-Bush agenda. It's really not more complicated than that\\". This is an actual quote from one of the 1 star reviews here. I'm sorry, is that so wrong? An Anti-Bush agenda? That's wrong? Oh! Of course! Of course it's wrong! We're supposed to eat everything that's fed to us by the media and government, right right. I keep forgetting. In the shadow of September 11th we're supposed to hang little American flags out of our car windows and support the President no matter what. Even when he uses the worst terrorist attack on America as an excuse to attack a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks purely just to profit from oil. From this tragedy we get an amazing documentary that tells it like it is and people don't like that. The truth hurts and to be shown that the people who run this country are not what they seem is too much to handle apparently, especially for bible thumping war vets who probably still think women shouldn't vote and black people should sit in the back of the bus. Bush is a liar and a murderer and people need to know it. This is in your face facts that CNN and other news channels are too afraid to show you. BOTTOM LINE! <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|As stated in my title line...documentaries are supposed to be based on facts...but then, John Kerry would probably agree with my review before he disagrees with it (sound familiar?). <br /> <br />Don't you just love how Moore has such a rabid need to bash Pres. Bush at any & all costs to the truth, when Clinton was the pres. for the previous 8 years and turned down chances to both \\"aquire\\" Osama bin-Laden as well chances to kill him?  But, no...the entire culture of America's intelligence community falls upon the shoulders of a man who was president for less than 8 months! <br /> <br />Liberals take note:  wanting something to be the truth doesn't make it facts!  Michael Moore has given us in 2004 a \\"documentary\\" just as Orson Welles gave us a \\"documentary\\" in 1938 (The War of the Worlds!) <br />
B0000203YT|4.0|As a satire this movie was hugely entertaining.  Some of the plot developments were so implausible that they might have fit well into one of Shakespeare's own plays quite nicely, and I strongly suspect that the screenwriters were quite deliberate in this regard.  They also quite ruthlessly maul history when it serves their purposes --- something also to which the Bard could well relate.  The dialogue & the storyline cruise along at a wonderful pace.  Only when Will & Viola stand around getting all dreamy-eyed over each other does the movie begin to move into some dangerously cheesy territory.<br /><br />But the cheesiness is kept more or less in check.  Judi Dench & Geoffery Rush turn in great supporting performances.  Colin Firth is wonderfully reptilian and one-dimensional a perfect Shakespearian villain (like Don John, for example) in many ways.  Even Ben Affleck seems moderately competent and appears capable of acting; the movie probably deserves an award simply for managing to pull that off.<br /><br />Did this movie deserve 7 Oscars?  It is hard to argue that it did, because despite the great writing it is still a rather lightweight romantic comedy at its core.  However, it is a lot of fun to watch and may tempt some people actually to read up on their Shakespeare (and possibly their Marlowe as well).  It is hard to find fault in that.
B000000LZV|5.0|One thing is for sure, this will never be done again, not like Bad Religion and the 5 milion bands that sound like them. While the Minutemen may influence music for years to come, no one can or will duplicate the exact sound of them. RIP D.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Explorers is a must for all true science fiction film collectors. The plot elegantly captures the dreams of a typical young sci-fi fan / space enthusiast. Hawke, then about 12, receives schematics from outer space in his dreams. His buddy Phoenix builds a circuit from the dream-diagram and hooks it to his computer, generating a miraculous force field capable of driving a space ship - which they build, with a third pal from school (Presson), from junkyard parts!<br /><br />Joe Dante's 1985 space adventure pays homage to classic sci-fi in a number of allusions: the videos Ethan Hawke watches in bed (The War of The Worlds and This Island Earth), the old sf paperbacks and Classics Illustrated comics in River Phoenix's basement, the mouse named Heinlein (after the great American science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein), and the usual supporting roles of Dick Miller and Robert Picardo (The Burbs, Matinee, etc.). Watching this movies always puts me in the mood to reread the Heinlein juvenile novels (Have Space Suit, Will Travel, Rocket Ship Galileo, etc.).<br /><br />If anyone says they're disappointed in the ending, that's only because the first 90 minutes of the film are so excellent, it's hard for any ending to live up to the oustanding buildup, including exploring the interior of a huge alien spacecraft.  Take it for what it is, and if you're into space ships or sci-fi, you'll love it.

B00006AV2A|4.0|I just got the CD I like it, but i wish i could say its great. I extrememly like \\"krwlng\\" and \\"my dsmbr\\". Many of the songs are good but some of them could dissapoint some fans cause they are a bit butchered and some have alot of rap chouruses, but I loke the album. I usually dont like remixes, either. I absolutely reccomend this album to linkin park fans.
0312995423|2.0|In all fairness, this is the first of Dan Brown's books I've read. <br />Considering all the hype about \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" I was expecting something a bit better. <br /> <br />This book isn't a novel -- it's a screen play. Very short chapters,  <br />typically consisting of a single scene each. Poor character development. Predictable plot. But, suspense aplenty. It ought to make a wildly successful movie, in other words. <br /> <br />Dan Brown didn't do his homework for this one. The background details don't jive. For example, when his characters speak German, it's grammatically correct all right, but not idiomatic. In other words, its not the way native speakers would do it. (I happen to be fluent in German.) <br /> <br />Another example. The cryptology in the book is more or less superficially correct, but on a deeper level it's pretty much bogus. The central premise of the book, an unbreakable cipher, is  <br />just plain wrong. (I don't claim to be an expert on this, but I *have* written encryption software.) <br /> <br />Hopefully, Brown did better in his later books, but at the moment  <br />I'm not particularly tempted to find out. <br /> <br /> <br />The reader looking for good reads in the suspense genre would be <br />well advised, in this reviewer's opinion, to try Trevanian or Graham Greene instead.
B00005KHKX|5.0|Some movies really begin to show their age after a few decades have passed.  Other than some of the musical sequences, this movie continues to be profoundly disturbing in many ways.  Its conclusion literally made my jaw drop (one of only 3 movies to do so) when I first saw it.  Repeated viewings may of course lack the punch since I know the outcome, but the depth & complexity of the content continues to draw me back from time to time.<br /><br />Like a really good thriller/horror --- whatever you want to call it --- this movie leaves as many questions unanswered as answered when it concludes.  One cannot help but wonder when Sgt. Howie turns the tables on Lord Summerisle at the end, if he has in fact ultimately won the battle of wits by forcing Summerisle to take a huge gamble.  What will happen if the crops fail again the next year?  We do not know the answer, but we cannot help but imagine the scene as the film concludes.  We continue to ask the same questions, even 30 years later.  That is good film-making.
B0002DB52M|5.0|LVT has produced some of the most gut-wrenching and thought-provoking works of the last decade.  \\"Dogville\\" does not disappoint.  I have a theory that will probably offend, but here goes.  Anyone who has a problem with the length of his stories,either finding it boring or slow is someone who is unaware that it takes time to form an impact.  If they had shown the climax to \\"Dogville\\" after 1 hour of character development and story, its impact would be nil.   <br />I have to say that I was overwhelmingly satisfied with the denounment, and draw political allusions if you must, as they are there to be taken, but I was swept away by the literal aspect of the story.  I found it highly entertaining, and expertly crafted.
B00005JMAH|5.0|okay, everyone who is totally slamming this movie, put your egos aside and put yourself in the director's shoes.  he simply cannot live up to everyone's expectations of what the movies should be like.  personally, i was glad he didn't stick to a page-by-page adaptation and kept the storyline simple.  and if you really think about it, he did get the point of the story across.  i loved this movie, and can't wait to watch it over and over in my DVD player!   <br />PS: if you wanna see an adaptation that doesn't stay true to the storyline, watch a Disney adaptation of a book!
B000002RA9|5.0|It's quite simple, really. 'Space Ritual' is one of the BEST live albums ever made. Although Hawkwind have come close to perhaps matching the quality and the brilliance of this 2-lp reissued, of course on 2-CD, the band really hasn't managed to release any title that surpasses 'Space Ritual'. Keep in mind,they've released PLENTY of live CD's. Their 'Yule Ritual' comes close. As everyone probably knows, this title features the historic / classic Hawkwind line-up of Brock, Turner, Dettmar, Lemmy, Calvert, King and Dik Mik. 110% pure space rock, 1972 style. More than deserves a hallowed place in your music collection.
B000003S0D|5.0|I remember the day this album was released.   I first discovered King Crimson the day their blockbuster first album (Court of the Crimson King) hit the US record stores.  I bought in on a hunch, the cover was soooo enticing.  Needless to say, I, as the rest of the world, was blown away.  When Wake of Poseidon hit the stores I again struck on the first day.  It seemed then and now to be an attempt to recreate The Court.  I can't say it's bad, but it seemed and seems to be a copy of themselves.  Nothing groundbreaking.    The band started to fall apart and I thought we'd heard the last of Crim.  Then, without any warning, Lizard arrived at the local record store.  New band, same name.  Without hesitation I brought the record home (that's what they were in those days... we really did wear them out).  I was left speechless.  It was nothing I expected.  Extremely different, yet very much the same.  There was something intangible that made it Crimson.  Loved if for both it's difference and sameness.  It was fresh and innovative.    I discovered a singer on side two of this album.  I discovered that he was the member of a band named Yes.  Bought a bunch of their albums.  Loved them too (at least until Bruford left).  This album started a theme.  Players would come and go.  Fripp would do things under different names (League of Gentlemen, for example).  But certain groups would get together and have to be named King Crimson.  You can hear the reason.  It's that obvious intangible.  I believe this album set the stage.  It might have been totally different, but it was undeniably King Crimson.  I was relieved the day I heard it, I knew the well hadn't run dry. Still hasn't.
0060730552|4.0|Well, I'm one of many (I presume) who saw the magnificent film of \\"Touching the Void\\" first and then searched for the book for a more detailed version of this undeniably incredible story.  This is one of those rare occasions where I enjoyed the film more, if for no other reason than the fantastic cinematography and splendid acting.  As far as there being more detail in the book it is remarkable how faithful the film is to the story, with little left out.  The extra detail includes, for the most part, more self-reflection on the part of Joe Simpson on his horrendous descent from Siula Grande.  During the course of the book I frequently felt as if Joe could be anywhere crawling through a frozen wasteland with a severe injury and unknowingly pushing himself to the limits of physical endurance.  It is an amazing story, and I'm sure it would have felt more so if I hadn't already seen the film a couple of times.  Something else I think would have helped the book immensely is if it had been written by both climbers involved.  As it is, Joe Simpson writes for both and conveys sincere honesty in the character of Simon Yates but there were times when I actually forgot which of the two were thinking.  The writing, itself, is surprisingly good and thoughtfully crafted.  I thought so highly of the writing here, that by page twenty I went back online and purchased another of his books, \\"The Beckoning Silence.\\"  There are a few words unfamiliar to the average citizen that are used here like \\"abseil\\" and \\"karabiner,\\" but thankfully there is a glossary of these type terms listed in the back of the book.  There are a couple of clustered photographs in the center of the book taken during the ascent and subsequent trip back to civilization.  There is also an added epilogue called \\"Bad Memories\\" in which Joe Simpson recounts his return trip to Siula Grande and all the images and feelings it invoked.  All in all, this is a solid true adventure story filled with fine writing and thought-provoking story-telling.  And the packaging is first-rate.  Recommended.
B00004U2GH|5.0|If you think you can answer that--think again!  Johnny Cash is a legend--not only of country music, but of all musical genres.  Need proof?  Listen to COMPLETE LIVE AT SAN QUENTIN, and try to tell me otherwise.<br /><br />This album is explosive.  On a small stage at one of the country's most ill-reputed prisons, Cash commands an audience of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and all other sorts of criminals.  He brings their daily perils to life (\\"San Quentin,\\" a song the audience loved so much they demanded he play it again), and digs deep into their psyche (\\"Folsom Prison Blues\\").  He sings tales of desire (\\"Ring of Fire\\"), of heartbreak (\\"I Still Miss Someone\\"), of outlaws (\\"Wanted Man\\"), of wrongful justice (\\"Starkville City Jail\\"), of family (\\"Daddy Sang Bass\\"), of Jesus (\\"He Turned The Water Into Wine\\"), and of a boy named Sue (unbleeped, by the way).  He sings songs for them, for himself...and for you, decades later.  This is a classic, timeless, performance, even more memorable than his Folsom Prison show.  This is Johnny Cash LIVE AT SAN QUENTIN--this is Johnny Cash at his legendary best.
0156027321|5.0|I can't believe this book has yet to be reviewed here...it is one of the best I've read this year so I assumed this page would be filled with praise. <br /> <br />Martel's writing style is relaxed and very enjoyable and the story is simply entertaining.  I finished reading this book over two months ago and still find myself thinking about it.  It holds your interest, keeps you thinking and then leaves you wondering about it  after your done. <br /> <br />I burn through a couple dozen books a month and this was one of the most thoroughly enjoyable books I've read in some time!
B00006GEXQ|4.0|The first few lines of this review will be dedicated to a fellow reviewer by the name of Joey.  I have read a great deal of Joey's reviews and have a few things to say about them.  They are short, badly written, have horrible grammer, and are of little use to interested customers.  Even the things he likes he can't manage to express himself in more than 4 lines of split infinitives and incomplete sentances.    <br />   Now that that is off my chest we can get to the good stuff.  About A Boy is a wonderful flick and can only be appreciated by those who are willing to delve into its subplots.  Hugh Grant brilliantly plays the shallow, self-absorbed playboy who befriends a socially gauche teenager at first to make himself look better in the eyes of a single mom, and later realizes that in Marcus he has found himself a friend.  I really enjoyed this movie and the book is even better. <br />
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Everything and maybe more has been said about this jewel. It is almost perfect. The only note out of tune is the live version of \\"Bye Bye Love\\". So, Paul...Art...WHY DID YOU DO THAT??? Without that song your latest album would have been THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!! I propose Sony Music to re-re-re-release the album simply by cutting track 10 and so taking off the applauses which ruin the beginning of \\"Song For The Asking\\". I am sure Paul&Art will not agree with me, but I am as much sure that all Tom&Gerry fans will.
B00005JMUA|5.0|As i said on Vol. 1,Quentin Tarantino worked his @$$ off but this time,he made the series better!this movie is sooo much better than the first that i loved this one!see,the first one had all action and NO STORYLINE but on this one,more storyline and less action.Just so know,Uma dosent \\"kill bill\\" the way you'd think she would(hope i diddnt ruin it for you).
B0002L592Q|5.0|Not that much content besides the Two-Disc Special Edition with the soundtrack and a little book, yet if you are a fan of the movie (as I am) then why not plop down another twenty bucks for something even more Special: Deluxe Limited.
B00000K3D4|5.0|The first movie I remember seeing is Labyrinth.  It is the perfect blend of fantasy and realism.  David Bowie plays a role that I swear was written just for him. His presence and raw sex-appeal are unparalled by few actors.  Jennifer Connely is perfect as the naive Sarah, who searches the Labyrinth to find her brother.  If you are a David Bowie fan than this is the perfect movie for you.
B00008EY65|4.0|I was initially dragged to this movie by my husband, while actually, I go to his 'comic book flicks' and he goes with me to spy thrillers and dramas (we both like action).  I was very surprised that I liked this movie so much.  It is witty, action packed, with a touch of mystery and faith.<br /><br />I was surprised to see, although not very in-depth, that faith and Christian symbols were so prevelant, yet the movie was never preachy - now I know nothing of the comic, but it appeared to me that at a face value, Hellboy, who carrys his mentors cross, wasa nice touch of tension taht was, given the world created in the film, completely realistic.<br /><br />Next, the movie's special effects are fun, yet, not completely \\"out there\\" considering teh world in which the plot lays.  Ron Perlman from 'beauty and the beats' fame is just terric and this part fits him.  He delivers the lines with enough seriousness to treat his subject matter well, but enough tonge in cheek t remind us this is only a movie and a comic book one at that.<br /><br />Personally, I would like to give this film 5 stars, but because its my guilty pleasure doesn't mean I should overrate it - it does get a little too much at the end and the plot is probably a little too simple.  It is however, a great popcorn movie.
B00006JSS8|5.0|If you've a fan of Stevie's or just a fan of '60s,'70s & '80s R&B, disco, or the Motown sound, rush out and buy a copy of \\"Stevie Wonder - The Definitive Collection\\".  It's a great compilation of Stevie's best works!  Of course, it's not as complete as the huge body of Stevie's songs found in \\"At the Close of a Century\\", but at a about 25% of the price, it's a steal!  The liner notes are a bonus as well with many pictures of Stevie over his career. Also included are the chart listings and album covers for each of the 21 songs in this set.<br /><br />All of Stevie's most well-known hits are here including:  \\"For Once in My Life\\", \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered...\\", \\"Superstition\\", \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"Overjoyed\\", and so on.  Of course, some hits had to be left off this collection of 21 songs due to space (such as, \\"If You Really Love Me\\" and \\"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day) but this disc stretches out at a full 79+ minutes, so the listener gets his or her money's worth.  The only other pet peeve I have with this collection is that the version of \\"Do I Do\\" is the cut produced for a \\"single\\" and that the version containing Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet solo\\".<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|this dvd is kickin', it has so much more than the previously released version. The posters and the booklet are fun to read through and look at. Buy this DVD and keep it, because it is such a great movie to watch.
B000002U9L|5.0|I LOVE Labyrinth, it is one of my all time favorite movies and the soundtack is just as good.  David Bowie has an amazing talent and is one of the best singers I have ever heard.  I could listen to the soundtrack over and over again all day long.  If you are as big a David Bowie fan as I am than this is the soundtrack for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm just going to be another clump of kelp in a sea of adoration, but I still gotta throw my five stars into the ring on this one! <br /> <br /> All I have to say about \\"Firefly\\" is that the series' 14 episode run came as close to perfect artistic expression as any television series ever has and probably ever will. Every camera angle, every lighting detail, every line of dialogue seems to have been the outcome of hours and hours of careful planning and obsessive love for the craft. A more action-packed, screamingly funny and throat-tighteningly heart touching a thing has never been commited to film. A single episode of this series kicks the tar out of 99.9% of anything else shown on t.v. in a given season. Even the audio commentaries on this DVD set are a hoot! I'd recommed that Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion start up a comedy act and hit the vaudeville circuit except that vaudeville's been kinda on the dead side for the past fifty years or so. <br /> <br /> Anyone who doesn't like this show is obviously flawed, self-loathing, and a heavy drinker. If there is a \\"Firefly\\" hater somewhere in your life I urge you to sever all ties with them! They are of an inferior ilk (i.e. Fox executives) and obviously not to be trusted! Leave them to rot in their smelly puddles of \\"Ugly Duckling\\" and \\"Shallow Joe\\" and \\"The Simpleton's Life\\" while the rest of us sit back and await the coming \\"Serenity\\" to take us away!
B000002AH7|4.0|Miles Davis -- when you pick up an album of his you never know what you are going to get.  He reinvented his sound several times in his career.  I would say that the results of this are uneven, but they really aren't - it is a matter of taste not talent.  (Think of how his album  _Bitches' Brew_ got panned thoroughly, but is today considered to be one of his best non traditional albums.)<br /><br />In this Album, _Sketches of Spain_, he takes on some Spanish classical music - and some spanish folk elements, and weaves a classical-jazz crossover album.<br /><br />I will be honest, I didn't think this would be my cup of tea as I like real Spanish Flamenco music.  I was afraid that many Flamenco effects would seem kind of cheesy and dated. I picked it up anyway, since for the times (late 50's early 60's), a little of this flavor was welcomed and difficult to find - very fashionable.  I can see how this would be considered a \\"masterpiece.\\"  Even from the elements introduced, the music had a 1950's classical music feel to it as well - as if it had been composed then - it is possible to have been arranged into that state, but either way, it feels like the late 1950's!<br /><br />The music itself is best characterized as a fusion of jazz and classical - while a bit more free flowing than what classical is known for - it never fully swings, and adopts just a hint of the Miles Davis you find in other recordings.  I haven't heard anything like this before in a \\"Jazz\\" album, and wouldn't think it falls into the Jazz camp strongly.  The fact that Miles pulls it off, tells you of his versatility and his talent.<br /><br />Aside from the cultural dressing, that may seem dated, this is music that will draw you into it.  I found myself even when playing it in our car, to become silent and just enjoy the music.  On our home stereo system, you can tell that even with remastering, it isn't as clear and crisp as some more modern recordings, (don't get me wrong, it is a decent remaster!) it still draws you into the music without fail.<br /><br />I had set out to give the music a 3/5 but on further reflection it is a solid 4/5.<br /><br />As long as you realize this is NOT the jazz typical of the players of the era and is more of a classical-jazz crossover with a hint of Spain as was very fashionable in the late 1950's, you won't be dissappointed.sic without fail.    I had set out to give the music a 3/5 but on further reflection it is a solid 4/5.

B000268QB2|5.0|This is a really good new group. Hadn't heard of them till recently.  I first heard them in a store that was playing their music video \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", and the song caught my attention, so I watched the video to see who it was by.  I would recommend this group, especially that song.  If only there was somewhere only a couple people knew about, i'm sure it would be a cool place to go.  Great song, great group!=)
1858286999|3.0|This book is not marred by the \\"where can an English-only speaker find a good place to get drunk and party\\" spirit of the Lonely Planet guide.  Sadly, however, it falls short of the Lonely Planet in the crucial departments of maps and index.  If you're in a rental car the fact that the Rough Guide maps don't show route numbers will be a painful discovery.  For train travelers, the book would be a lot more useful if the index were more comprehensive.

B000000WG4|4.0|Admittedly when I first heard this I thought, \\" Is that all? Christ, what do people see in this.\\" Just two tracks winding and winding up with different instruments used to different effects and I was left thoroughly unsatisfied but then I gave this another listen to just recently and if you treat it as a normal record it actually works fine. It is a bit of a journey and quite a pleasurable one at that too! It's just that you kinda have to lower your expectations for this to really work. And I suppose given that I heard Tubular Bells 2 when I was little my expectations for TB1 were great given that I loved listening to TB2. It's not perfect ( but then Mike for god sake don't tamper with it ( and we all know you have )) but then that is its charm
B000067DNC|5.0|SG-1 is a great show.  This show is better than other SciFi on TV for two main reasons (and a myriad of smaller ones): 1) a great cast who make you believe that they really do care about each other and what happens to their characters and 2) the stories are set in the present without altering reality outside the \\"series universe\\" more than necessary.  This lends an authenticity to the show that gives it more grit and brings you into the stories deeper than if the story were set as pure fantasy.  The military setting also gives added tension. <br /> <br />Season two has some great episodes including \\"In the Line of Duty\\" which adds to the mythology for the rest of SG-1. The season finale leading into season 3 will have you on the edge of your seat!  This is a must buy for SG-1 fans.
B000002UW1|4.0|While REM had had 4 previous albums w/ underground hits like radio free europe and driver 8, it was not until document that they finally broke through and got a radio hit w/ the one i love. the band's last indie album, it was their 1st 2 gain widespread popularity because of the top 20 hit status of the sarcastic and often misunderstood the one i love and the rapid fire political its the end of the world as we know it. this album shows the greatness that was in store 4 yrs 2 come. if you aren't overly famililar w/ the indie REM music (except 4 the 2 hits from this CD), but like more modern REM, this is a good place 2 start, as 2 see what the band was like in its early days
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this cd is probably one of the best music ever put into one cd, except maybe their first one. the reason for my title, slipknot has taken a huge step away from screaming til it hurts, as im sure more than one person thinks. im not saying i didnt like the older albums. i loved em. corey taylor has taken more of a singing approach to most of their songs, and if not the vocal range has changed dramatically. you can understand what they say in most every song. id make a list of the ones that really totally rock, but i would be quicker to say they all rock. its a rare thing for me to listen to a cd and like every track. this is one of the few to pull it off. even the older ones couldnt do that. and for all you haters out there who despise slipknot with a passion, dont make a review bashing them unless youve actually heard it and say \\"man i think this is crap\\" slipknot is the best band ever. if you think slipknot will never change, listen to vermilion pt.2 or circle and try to say it again.
B0002IU988|4.0|I bought this CD the day it was released because I am a huge Creed fan. I would say Alter Bridge is very different from Creed. I tried very hard not to compare because I didn't want to be unfair to the \\"new\\" band. It took me several listens to finally decide that this is a very good CD, but not as good as Creed. Myles Kennedy is a terrific singer, but something is lacking. After owning the CD for nearly two weeks and playing it constantly, I decided to listen to Creed and compare. Myles Kennedy is lacking the warmth that Scott Stapp always has when he sings. Listening to Myles' singing can get annoying after a while. I listened to Creed's CDs a million times and never felt that way about Stapp. Also, Myles and Mark don't seem to have the diversity in their lyrics. Most of the songs seem to be about the same subject. Stapp's lyrical prowess was mindblowing, he wrote about so many different topics and always with the passion, compassion, and warmth that I feel was key to Creed's music and is definitely missing in Alter Bridge's. Myles Kennedy's voice, while it is terrific as I said, the operatic style of it definitely reminds me of '80s metal, and especially of Queensryche's lead singer. I'm 40 years old and I've been listening to rock music since the '70s so I know what I'm talking about comparing Alter Bridge to '80s metal. The music most of the time reminds me of it, also. To me, this is not a bad thing because I loved '80s metal. Also, the musicianship is suberb on this CD, but we would expect that since we're familiar with Mark, Scott, and Brian. Speaking strictly about the music now and not the lyrics, there's not much diversity here at all compared to \\"Weathered.\\" Practically every song on \\"Weathered\\" was like an adventure. All in all, if I were not to compare Alter Bridge in any way to Creed and just look at it as a debut album, it's awesome, much better than a lot of the garbage that's out there today. Recently I purchased a bunch of CDs of newer bands and they just didn't thrill me and ended up being sold on Amazon.com. I would say, pick this CD up and enjoy and try not to think about Creed! I'll be looking forward to Stapp's solo effort!
B00009P1O0|5.0|On The Beach is one of three albums Neil Young recorded during perhaps the darkest period of his life as he was struggling to move forward following the overdoses of both fellow Crazy Horse bandmate Danny Whitten and road crew member Bruce Berry. While his following album Tonight's The Night is the critical and fan favorite from this period, On The Beach is a true portait of man trying to deal with the turmoil placed upon him. In fact, the mood here makes Tonight's The Night almost sound celebratory.<br /><br />The only upbeat song here is the leadoff track \\"Walk On\\" which was a minor hit single. After this the album is a very somber affair. Neil's guitar is all about mood here as his loud high-pitched solos when playing with Crazy Horse are seldom heard. While the strong tracks \\"For The Turnstiles\\", \\"Motion Pictures\\", and \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" musically sound similar to his country tinged songs on Harvest, it's the melancholy tone of both Neil's voice and lyrics which distinguish them from his previous work. Although there are three songs here with the word blues in them, the tone of each track is very different. \\"Vampire Blues\\" is a very raggedy track which totally contradicts the song's \\"Good times are coming\\" lyric. \\"Revolution Blues\\" comes closest to Crazy Horse in spirit and includes accompaniment by David Crosby and bassist Rick Danko and Levon Helm from The Band. \\"Ambulance Blues\\" is a long acoustic song which find Neil's voice bouncing between depressing and hopeful throughout the track. Rusty Kershaw's fiddle playing and Neil's harmonica also add to the dour mood of this track. However, it's the slow title track which is the album's centerpiece and certainly one of the best songs that Young has ever written. Neil's voice is so emotional here, it's as though he's crying. The band's performance, which includes Graham Nash guesting on piano, complements the song perfectly. One of his finest works and along with This Note's For You his most underrated, On The Beach is a timeless document by one of the best singer/songwriters in rock history. Highly recommended.n The Beach is a timeless document by one of the best singer/songwriters in rock history. Highly recommended.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Althoug the photography is beautiful (lighting is really off sometimes) and Jude Law is convincing as always I would not recommend this film. To quote \\"this is 2 1/2 hours of your life you'll never get back\\".. the dramatic scenes are just enough to keep you awake during the rest of Nicoles egotrip... <br />and then after 135 minutes of seriousness you are brushed off with this ending.... <br />Only watch if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I have heard much said in comparison between WYATT EARP, starring Kevin Costner, and TOMBSTONE, starring Kurt Russell.  Invariably most critics seem to gravitate to the shorter, bloodier TOMBSTONE.  But I'd have to say that I like both for different reasons.<br /><br />WYATT EARP is classic Costner.  Long, meticulously accurate and comprehensive.  I like this movie for the insight that it provides into Earp's storied life.  Earp's adolescence and early adulthood are usually left out leading Earp aficionados to believe that he was born full grown and living in Tombstone instead of in Missouri.  The story of the loss of his wife and the short-lived life of crime were fascinating.  Earp's work as a buffalo skinner and freighter also added to the ultimate lore.<br /><br />WYATT EARP is very likely one of Costner's best performances, more believable than his role as John Dunbar in DANCES WITH WOLVES and a precursor to his recent triumph in OPEN RANGE.<br /><br />As with TOMBSTONE, it's interesting that the scene stealer is Doc Holliday, played in WYATT EARP by Dennis Quaid.  Whereas TOMBSTONE'S Doc, Val Kilmer, emerges as more of a dandy, Quaid, with the emaciated personna that he assumed for the role (he lost over forty pounds!), his steely-eyed scowl and his rampant sarcasm, is much more believable as Holliday, reputed to be one of the coldest killers in the history of the West, than is Kilmer.  Granted, Kilmer is wonderful, but Dennis Quaid emerges as the frightening, psychotic killer that Holliday was.<br /><br />WYATT EARP also showcases the talents of many of Hollywood's brightest stars.  Gene Hackman, though in no more than a cameo, is wonderful as Nicholas Earp, the patriarch of a large family who instills within the minds of his family that nothing matters more than blood and kin.  Catherine O'Hara and JoBeth Williams star as the feisty wives of Morgan and James Earp. Mare Winningham is perfect as the ill-fated Mattie Blaylock, the woman who assumed that she was Wyatt Earp's common-law wife and, in the end, fades into a cloud drug-induced stupor.  Bill Pullman is wonderful as Ed Masterson, the \\"affable,\\" unheralded brother of the famous Bat Masterson, played by Tom Sizemore. And Ma Ingles, Karen Grassle, is trotted out in the cameo of Wyatt's mother-in-law, Mrs. Sutherland.<br /><br />Yes, WYATT EARP is long and drawn out. But the story, the James Newton Howard soundtrack and the wonderful panoramic cinematography are well worth it.<br /><br />THE HORSEMANat she was Wyatt Earp's common-law wife and, in the end, fades into a cloud drug-induced stupor.

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|omg this is the best compilation cd that has been out in awhile.  the version of 'all you need is love' is not as good as the one in the movie, because they've added an extra backbeat to it, which makes it distracting. awesome awesome album!!
B000002N2P|5.0|I'll add my voice to the (long) list of people that are all saying the same thing:  this is easily Green Day's best effort.  A lot of listeners were disappointed when this was released after the mega-success of \\"Dookie,\\" and brushed it off as simply not living up to \\"Dookie\\"'s sound.  Well...those people are idiots. <br /> <br />\\"Insomniac\\" is not only Green Day's best album, but I would not hesitate to call it one of the top 10 (or at least top 20) punk rock albums of all time.  And, yes, Green Day is punk rock, even if they are on a major label.  Every song bristles with catchy hooks, crunching guitars, and snotty vocals.  If you're one of the \\"Insomniac\\" dissenters, you probably haven't bothered to listen to the album.  Hands down, one of my favorites.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie had many honest points that probably were true.  It explored many shady aspects which surrounded 911 and the war in Iraq.  Alas, though, its focus was not only one-sided, but also ironic.  It condemed Bush as if he was the root of all evil, yet did nothing to report all the wrongdoings which have been done by some of America's greatest presidents.  Michael Moore simply has a beef with the world because his hometown of Flint is a welfare ridden town because the people there obviously cannot get jobs.  I do not really know why this is, but I can garantee you that if I lived in Flint I would see to it that I had a job and I would work my ass off just like I do now.  I think that the people in Flint need a lesson in hard work, and not a merely a scapegoat, that being the president.  Michael Moore is a liberal democrat who obviously has no true morals and probably never enters the door of a church.  This is a honorable person if you are John Kerry who is the antichrist when it comes to morals.

B00005JLKB|5.0|This is a top quality adaptation of the Superman legend that is on a par with movies like Spider-Man 2. The best thing about Smallville is that they have 21 hours to develop the characters and master plot and the pacing is still fast. All the characters are great.     It is the thoroughly engaging story of a young man with extraordinary powers on the cusp of adulthood. It is a superhero science fiction/ romance much like Spider-Man 2 was. Smallville has fantastic movie quality production values and spectacular effects. The writers overcome the challenge of creating villains powerful enough to threaten Clark. The friendship between Lex and Clark is ominous since we know him to be an enemy in the future.     There is a perfectly handled love story between Clark Kent (Tom Welling)and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). I would love to see these two fine actors in the new Superman feature film as Superman and Lois Lane (It would make sense for Clark to fall for a Lana look-alike.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Technically Inferior by todays standards, yet riveting.  The 4th, 5th, and 6th episodes of the 6 part series.  These are not the original versions but the \\"enhanced\\" by computer re-released versions.  I believe that perfection should of been left alone but as we know as technology gets better, we like to make better of the old.  Anywho.........Considering the 1st was filmed in 1975-1976 for a 1977 release, this and the 2 follow ups are excellent fanfare.  Not even a sci-fi hater would shun away from these great soap opera of the stars epics.  John Williams music adds power and panache to the films and George Lucas has the imagination of a 12 year old that could only mean greatness when it comes to story telling.  His THX sound system only pushes the the audio envelope even further.  Definately worth the money.  Especially for the enthusiast.  And as I say with every review, DON'T BOTHER WITH THE FULL SCREEN VERSION OF ANY MOVIE.  THERE IS A 100% LOSS OF ARTISTIC VALUE AND DIRECTION. IF THE BARS BOTHER YOU THAT MUCH ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE FILM, ADD A CURTAIN TO YOUR TV OR BUY A WIDESCREEN SET!!!!!!
B000002LGQ|5.0|I love this record.  I remember the first time I heard \\"Like a Prayer\\".  I absolutely love this song.  It is my all time favorite from Madonna.  The soft and loud parts are truly awesome and the lyrics are truly exceptional.  I can listen to this album from beginning to end.  I love all of the songs, specially \\"Oh father\\", \\"Promise to try\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\", although I like the version that appears on \\"THe Inmaculate Collection\\" much better.  I think this is Madonna's best cd; the others can't even come close to it.
B000286RKW|5.0|What is there to say about a movie that was meant to be.  Great acting, one liners, history, music, originality, and Martin Scorsese. The best mob movie in a class all by itself.  Joe Pesci is top notch and the Robert DeNiro is seriously in to his role that makes for a believable piece of work.  The first release of this movie on DVD was a flipper.  You know some on side 1 and some on side 2.  This special edition has it all on one side and a bonus disc to boot. And oh what a bonus disc it is.  I'm still wiping up the drool. A definate want for movie collectors.  Even if you do get bored someday of the film if this is at all possible, try counting the \\"F\\" words.  That'll keep you busy.
B000002MUW|3.0|After listening to this cd, I feel it is more R & B and electronica than anything.  The songs are mostly mellow.  The ones I truly like are \\"Secret\\" (one of Madonna's best songs), \\"I'd rather be your lover\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Take a bow\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\" (truly unique song).  What makes this album different from Like a Prayer is that I can listen to that cd entirely.  This one, to me, only stands out in this tracks.  Not a bad album, but could have been better.
B000059TFO|3.0|Historically fiction, but there is a great story here anyway. Excellent acting here too.  A corrupt town in Mississippi full of racists and KKK clan are treating the black folk like slavery still existed in 1964 America.  Not enough performances by black actors but when there is,, there are important messages.
B0000844I8|2.0|How this movie came to have such a large following of fans I have yet to figure.  The writers must have decided that plot was less important than visual interest, and threw everything but the kitchen sink into the movie: ancient Egyption symbolism, desert sands, strange animals, metamorphing guards, military weaponry, futuristic stun guns, flying alien aircraft, pyramids, space ships, atomic bombs, teleporting gates, and an ancient alien god-figure.  Then add a mix of romantic love interest, nerd versus bully imagery, and a patriotic vision of a rebellion of slaves versus evil master.  Can you imagine what the writers were thinking?     To be fair, the movie has a lot of visual interest and the action does hold the attention.  Just don't try to think too deeply about the plot.
B000005H4X|5.0|Straight Ahead Jazz!  If you enjoy 1950s and early 60s jazz, just buy it. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br />Moanin' - both versions are good <br />Come Rain or Come Shine - an old standby, well executed <br />Drum Thunder Suite - in case you'd forgotten this was an Art Blakey disc; Drum Thunder is the best IMHO. <br /> <br />The others are all good, but these are especially good.  I didn't think that the Warm-Up and Dialogue added too much, but some may enjoy the versimilitude.  Since this is a Rudy Van Gelder re-issue, I guess it's appropriate.  And, while I haven't listened to all of them, I think the sound quality on this is better than some of the RVG Blue Note re-issues.  <br /> <br />I have no qualms about giving this one Five Stars!
B00005JKJA|5.0|A really great movie for the select crowd.  If you enjoy surrealistic movies in general, or David Lynch movies in specific, then this is one not to be missed.  (All others take that at face value).  The imagery and interwoven plots are all connected, and the message... is one that may take a while to get.  Lynch sets the stage where reality and fantasy, life and death, and earthly existence and hell are all intermixed, and the viewer is left to sort out all the layers.
B0002IU988|5.0|I was a huge Creed fan, and I was slightly skeptical about this album. The clips online were of poor quality and I expected the album to, well, suck. <br /> <br />BUTTTTTTT I bought listened to the album before it hit stores and was completely shocked!!! IT IS AMAZING!!! It has a different sound than Creed; Alter Bridge is heavier, full of great guitar solos, and has fantastic lyrics and awesome melodies. Mark Tremonti (guitarist and writer of the music, melodies, and most lyrics) has come a long way since Creed. It's great to have Scott Phillips and Brian Marshall back - they are one-of-a-kind. <br /> <br />To all those who loved Creed, this band brings back memories because of Mark, Scott, and Brian. <br /> <br />To all those who hated Creed, Myles adds a completely different dimension in his singing (he sounds more like Chris Cornell than Scott Stapp). His voice is fantastic!! <br /> <br />To everyone else, this album is perfect and suits every listener's needs - there are metal-like songs, ballads, and everything in between. <br /> <br />This band is amazing and EVERYONE should DEFINITELY check out the album!!!

B000060P79|5.0|I really love this CD!  It is more \\"poppish-punk\\" rather than true punk rock, but so good.  The lyrics themselves are mostly about the pains of growing up and are sometimes on the down-side.  However, musically this CD is so uplifting and is energy-packed.  The songs are fun and the lyrics relatable for anyone who has ever been a teenager or 20-something, like me!  They are a great band and the lead singer's voice is really unique.  I love them because they are not only fun to listen to, but can actually sing.  The best songs are toward the beginning of the CD, but really it's all good!  For anyone who likes Good Charlotte, Avril, 3 Doors Down, Linkin Park, or Michelle Branch - or even if you don't; buy this CD.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|first time i seen this movie i had no idea what to expect. i hadn't heard anything about it from anyone, i just stumbled upon it when looking for other movies to see. what an experience it was. it seemed to me that the people that gave bad reviews on this were just mad that they had to use their brains to think about what this movie meant. even from the beginning you are wondering where a jet engine came from that crashed into donnies bedroom. there was a perfect soundtrack and a bizarre 6 foot bunny to watch out for. the mad mad world song at the end wrapped things up wonderfully. i thought it was insanely funny that patrick swayze would take a part in the movie as he did but i don't want to spoil it. the entire cast did an amazing job of maintaining a real family feeling. overall, great movie if you are ready to see something more than once to attempt to understand it. there are a few parts that are left as loose ends so that it leaves the audience guessing, just the way i like it.

The melodies are addictive and the lyrics are still relatable to myself and many of my college friends. <br />The best part is that the songs do not get old and I'm writing this review after having the Cd for 2 years.  Of her two Cds this one is definitely the best all-around.  She has a combo of a lyrical popish Michelle Branch and harder-rock Alanis sound.  It's truly worth the money!  Best songs are Sk8tr Boi, Losing Grip, I'm With You and Things I'll Never Say.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I admit...I read the critic's reviews, thinking this movie would be a lame film with bad acting, so I never went to the theatre or didn't bother renting the movie. Luckily I was bored tonight and decided to order it on digital cable to pass some time, THANKFULLY I DID. This to me personally was one of the best movies I have ever seen, my jaw is still on the floor. The creativity and originality of this film is really what we needed in this era of boring, recycled movies we have today.  <br /> <br />Wow, I can't describe this...I know a movie is great when afterwards I can't seem to think clearly or put into words how I feel. Go see this movie.
B00005JN2X|5.0|'Collateral' is classic Michael Mann - it resembles 'Heat' in a lot of ways.  Mann spends time on character development.  We get to know Janie Foxx's character 'Max' very well through about a 15-minute or so introduction.  It's great movie making.<br /><br />By contrast, Tom Cruise's 'Vincent' is a cipher here.  And rightfully so.  Mann's unwillingness - and Foxx's inability - to penetrate Vincent is crucial to the chill that develops whenever Vincent swings into action.  Cruise is great - never once did I think \\"that's Tom Cruise playing Vincent.\\" Instead, the guy frightened me to death.  So much for the theory that Tom Cruise has to play the hero.  He's about as far from that here as you can get.<br /><br />Foxx surpasses even that praise.  He's deserves an Academy Award nomination here.  His 10-minute scene with Javier Bardem is just about the finest piece of acting you'll ever see.  This one-on-one confrontation was reminiscent of the Pacino/DeNiro (\\"I do scores\\") meet in 'Heat.'
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm highly anticipating this dvd set. Taking into account the superiority of the previous SW DVD's this set is sure to be simply amazing.  The films themselves are argued to be the best film series ever, and the viewing of Episodes 1-6 in order will prove it!  The films in this set have some minor effects and art adjustments to make them seemless with the first three episodes.  The SW buffs will notice the differences, but the general audience won't.  For the those who will die if the orginals theatrical versions are never released on dvd, don't worry, there are enough VHS copies floating around to keep you satisfied for the rest of your lives.  This is sure to be the greatest DVD set ever.
0805076476|4.0|Keeps you wanting to read more, makes you get into the whole fight club rules, gets you excited about the concept, and confuses you with the characters and what the heck is going on...<br /><br />A great book to read (now need to get the movie), a lot of action, never a dull moment, and a lot more action...The fight club joins many professionals and gets them out of their daily frustrations and personal lives into a world with no limits, no brakes, and no rules...<br /><br />Fight club members recognize each other, but the first rule about the fight club is never to talk about the fight club...<br /><br />A very dark, provocative book that leads you to go out and look for the closest fight club near you...
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I saw this movie way back in the original japanese, even before it was released in US/UK as that abomination \\"Warriors of the Wind.\\" The dvd, which is supposed to be released on August 31, 2004, (along with the Totoro and Porco Rosso films) is the same as the original I own, but it has the dubbed version and special features added, courtesy of Disney. Much like the rest of Miyazaki Hayao's films, Nausica of the Valley of Wind is a breathtaking piece of art and entertainment that you will definitely enjoy.
B0002I831S|5.0|I waited almost 15 years for an affordable box set of Star Trek: The Original Series to come out. I was imagining that there was only so much time before VCR tapes would be replaced by laser discs (or DVDs). I remember recording every episode from TV on my VCR. The acetate has been wearing off my old tapes so all I can say is it's about time this set came out! I am also sick of fast forwarding commercials for old Honda Accord 1991s, and the like.
B00004S6GL|5.0|i was somewhat skeptical if smith could possibly top \\"xo\\", but he's done exactly that with the release of \\"figure 8\\".  as his last release before his death, i find it to be his greatest yet.  tracks such as \\"junk bond trader\\" and \\"in the lost and found (honky bach)\\" bring out elliott's musical diversity, while others like \\"everything reminds me of her\\", \\"everything means nothing to me\\", and \\"wouldn't mama be proud?\\" are the remnants of works from his 'dark days'.  smith's beatles-esque style is shown through \\"pretty mary k\\", one of my personal favorites from the album.  it's a must-own release from an artist that's nothing short of brilliant.
0743243315|5.0|This is a superb novel - and that it is a first novel augurs much.  Over and over Ali's images and use of language caught my breath and stopped me on the page.  Every now and then I had to stop and immerse myself in an unbelievable passage.  We experience Nazneen's first baby as the most wonderful baby there could ever be.  \\"His face this last month had turned from awed to quizzical.  His features were not fully drawn, but they were more than sketched.  When he looked at her now, he was always on the point of asking a question.  Behind the question was a very big joke, and he looked as though he would let her in on it.\\"  Nazneen has been married off to a man much older than her and sent from her Bangladeshi village to London to live with him.  We follow her navigations in this new culture, rather narrowly circumscribed by her apartment walls and a few blocks surrounding them, and by language.  Ali is a strong and confident writer and has a delicate and loving understanding of people.  I strongly recommend that you treat yourself to this novel.
B00005RY7X|3.0|I gave this album 3.5 stars cause I don't really know how to judge this album.  The very things which make it great are also it's greatest flaws.  Andrew W.K. possesses a frenetic energy and positivity and lust for life that I really haven't seen in a singer since the great David Lee Roth fronted Van Halen in it's heyday.  Andrew has taken everything that's great about rock and heavy metal and disco and new wave and punk and hip hop and combined it into one explosive package...and then made it even BIGGER and MORE grandiose than anyone before him has imagined it to be.  Seriously, take a look at this album and try and compare it to anything that's come before it.  There really isn't anything like it, anywhere.  Andrew takes all the things that are infectious and catchy in popular music, that the hip later deride, and upped the cheesiness factor.  The choruses and harmonies are all huge, the beats are big and bouncy and danceable, the guitars are loud and fast, the tempo is always on maximum, the themes are all about partying and love and enjoying life and partying and living to the full and sex and partying.  This album comes upon all boundaries and shatters through them like a group of raging, steroid-pumped, testosterone-driven defensive linemen.  The mess it lives in its wake is like a beautiful sculpture made from all the disposable waste and garbage that is 'pop' culture.  Every song is an affirmation of life 'I Love NYC', 'Party Hard', 'She Is Beautiful', 'It's Time To Party', 'Fun Night', 'Girls Own Love' etc.  I can see jocks loving this stuff, cause its really hard not to get pumped up to this album.  The relentess rhythms make this a perfect car cd for when you're rushing off somewhere.  Put it on when you go out for a jog and I defy you to not keep pace in time with the beat.  W.K. takes the cheesiest synthesizer sounds, the disco-iest of disco beats, the heaviest guitar riffs, the loudest and catchiest choruses and somehow makes it work!  What bogs thealbum down, though, is it's sameness.  It's hard to listen to the album all the way through because it kinda just doesn't let up.  At all!  Sometimes it just wears you out.  There's no point in intellectualizing the album really, or even criticizing it...it is what it is and it kinda doesn't care what you think.  I don't know how to describe it, really.  It's unapolegetic in its earnestness and its passion.  Andrew W.K. has put out this little piece of perfection and I must say I dig his stuff.  Not every song is great, but the ones that rock, REALLY ROCK!!! <br />
B0002IU988|5.0|This is the best debut CD I've purchased in a long time.  Myles Kennedy is perfect for the magnificent guitar of Mark Tremonti and stirring songs written by both.  Love this!!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I loved this movie!! It is the best Harry Potter movie of the first three. The actors did a wonderful job! I have seen this movie several times, and I never get tired of watching it. I am also a fan of the books and still loved the movie.
B00018D3JQ|4.0|Projects like these are usually and simoultaneously slaughtered and revelled by critics and the public alike. It's only natural. Some will find it offensive that such legends as Joy Division or the Dead Kennedys are getting so \\"harmlessly\\" covered while others will think that there's something to it. I tend to belong to the latter even if it took me several listens to get to that point.       What does the trick in my opinion, is firstly the great vocals incorporated in this album and only on a secondary basis the music (which only has a decorative function for the most part). It's the sensual and very provocative voice over the music though that steals the show, and it does so not only very convincingly but also with a brio and humor that will make you succumb to its charms in the end. Just listen to the cover of \\"Too drunk to f**k\\" by the Kennedys and you'll perfectly understand where I'm coming from.        It's all covers of course from beginning to end, some more inspired than others and that includes names such as Nirvana the D.Mode or the Pretenders. There's a consistency in the way the whole project is realised which makes it almost a concept album, and as i said above it's definately an LP that earns the characterisation of a \\"grower\\".        I usually belong to the basher crowd when it comes to projects like this but Nouvelle Vague have definetely got a great touch to offer here. I just hope this is not all there is top them like it was with Apocalyptica. Time will show, but as a debut this is indeed intriguing...
0451167716|5.0|Could such a wholesome title apply to Mario Puzo's The Godfather?  You bet.  This book is excellent.  No mob story can compare to the story of Vito Corleone and his sons.  While the backbone of the book is the mafia and its shady dealings, much stronger tones come through regarding the importance of family and honor, the best examples being the way Sonny looks after and tries to defend his sister from her abusive husband, and young straight-laced Michael adapting and takingthe family business when the chips are done.  Vito Corleone is one tough hombre, but he truly does understand the value of looking after his own, and understand that even in crime, there are limits on what one should be involved in.  Of course there are themes of betrayal, and 'power corrupts', this is after all the Coreleone family - not the Brady Bunch.  Even then, this is one of those stories where you end up sympathizing, or even identifying with the title characters even when their behaviors are questionable.  <br /> <br />As busy or exhausted as I am most of the time, it usually takes me about a week to finish a pretty decent book.  However, the right book can captivate and force a quick read.  This is one of those books.  I cracked it open on a flight from Orlando to Harrisburg, PA and was done by the time I landed in Orlando a two days later.  I couldn't stop as the plot weaved in and out of locations and situations all inticately connected by Puzo's world of organized crime. <br /> <br />I am purposely leaving out major plot vehicles because all you really need to know going into this book that it is about organized crime and the 'cosa nostra' (our thing) mob tradition. The rest - the twists, turns and side-plots are just too good to give away in a review.  If you liked the movie, you obviously know what the story was about - grab this book.  I know it's been said before about any movie by just about every book-lover- but as good as this movie and Brando's performace were, they pale in comparison to the novel.  One of the real treats is the narration of Vito's early days.  If you've never read Godfather but have seen and enjoyed Goodfellas and Scarface (among other great organized crime movies) grab this book and read it through - you're in for a real treat. <br />
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift is a classic Rock album , not a classic hard rock album , not a classic metal album, not a classic \\"grunge\\" album.That would limit the importance of this album is one of the greatest Rock albums of all time , is intense as in \\"we die young\\" wich describes one of the well known rock and roll statements \\"live fast, die young\\" inspired by young kids using drugs and driving Vipers as jerry Cantrell once described, \\"man in the box\\" with a very cool riff along the whole song describing a deadman perspective , \\"love,hate,love\\" awesome and intense track about sick love relactions, the funny \\"Iknow something bout you\\" and \\"sea of sorrow\\"about sick relations too <br />these are some of the incredible songs contained in this album. <br />Too bad that Layne Staley left this world already im sure we are missing a whole bunch of great song for the future <br />HM
1582403589|5.0|With some reluctance I picked up the \\"Days Gone Bye\\" trade about two months ago. I had sworn off zombie comics and horror comics in general due to a serious lack of quality amongst the books that I was reading. I had been hearing nothing but praise for \\"The Walking Dead\\" for months so I decided to go out and pick up a copy of the trade. I figured for $10 I couldn't go wrong. I decided to give it a shot. Now, when I started reading it I was a little disapointed. I thought it was a bit goofy acutally but I decided to read on. As the book progressed I began to see that Kirkman was actually utlizing the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse as a canvas to tell some seriously intense stories about the hope and perserverance of the human spirit in the face of terrible adversity. Rick Grimes[the main character] and company come off as a very real, very well developed characters. I found myself beginning to care for them very quickly. It turns out that as the story goes on, and the inevitable dread that follows a zombie infested world begins to take shape, the true horror of this comic begins to reveal itself. Although chock full of zombies, the real horror of this book is the things that the living members of the book have to endure in order to survive. Or rather, attempt to survive. As of this writing the book is up to issue #9 in monthly format. # 9 was the absoulte best comic I've read this year so far. This book can only get better.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|What a good album, gooooooooood!, very goooooooooood!!!!!!!, very addictive, great mixture of Sabbath, Kiss, G n R, Lynnird Skinnyrd, and of course with that Queens of the Stone Age ingredient all put together and mixed in the blender and the resoult is, \\"GIVE ME MORE\\" , I need more really, I hope a second album for this project be released soon and I can die a happy man. <br />HM
0316666343|5.0|As I sit here, fresh in the wake of The Lovely Bones, I wonder how to put into words what this book has done for me.  This book filled me and then drained me, over and over again. I have genuine and lasting cares for every character in this novel.  I find myself wondering \\"what became of the love that could have been and the love that was?\\"  Sebold is perpetually honest and empathetic when describing her characters.  It seems she loves them as much as I do.  The Lovely Bones is, how the late Susie Salmon described her first kiss- \\"a beautiful gasoline rainbow\\".  Bittersweet from beginning to neverend.
B0000669JL|5.0|It is the best of Bob Marley!, with two bonus tracks and a live version of \\"No Women No Cry\\". Legand is a must have for anyone Bob Marley fan!
B00009ATIX|5.0|Sadly, this seems to be one of those films where you either \\"get it\\" or you don't.  The first time I saw this film, it affected me in such a way that it was very hard to return to reality.  It left me silent, thinking about life, love, what it would be like to have a second chance in these circumstances.  Would I take it, even knowing the circumstances?  Would I do it to try to right a wrong, or would I do it to simply comfort my soul?  It left me in a pensive, almost poetic mood for a number of hours.  Yes, it's that good. <br /> <br />Clooney and McElhone are stellar (no pun intended) on screen together, as well as in scenes without the other.  The real beauty of this film is that you're allowed to *feel* what's going on more than just *seeing* it as they don't act out every little tiny thing.  There's lots of nuance, and the soundtrack is perfect for it, only enhancing, not detracting.  It's much different than your average film that hits you over the head with the same point time after time just to make sure you understand what they're trying to tell you.  This film doesn't do that, thankfully, and it's much better for it. <br /> <br />If you're one of the people who's seen the original film, you owe it to yourself to judge this film on its own merits, not in comparison.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I think Jeff Shannon's review of the movie sums it up so nicely.  This is a must watch film for anyone who loves adventure and life on the high seas.  It is the most realistic film of life aboard an English Ship of the Line (warship) that I personnaly have ever seen.  Having served in the navy for many years as an officer on submarines, I know so well what life is like away from loved ones and so many months at sea with only the men around you and work.  We didn't have the ale or rum though, hehe.  Some of them you come to hate, others you call friends, and some you come to love as a brother, just like in the movie.  And as an officer you must always maintain discipline, as depicted in the movie, much to the dislike of even Captain Jack. I know some of you reading this may not like me saying that, but in the military, that is a matter of fact.  It always will be. Many men at that time were pressed into service and of course did not like that.  They were in general disruptive, unruely and insubordinate, so harsh things were done at times.  I don't approve of it, but that was the way it was.  And in fact, when we still had a draft in this country, situations were similar for some draftees.  Most performed their duty well and were a wonderful credit to their country, family and friends.  A few though were maybe not so much a credit, as like in the movie.  At that time though, and still today in many countries as ours, men and women will rise to the call of duty for their country and do it proudly, just like Captain Jack when he told his men to prepare for the final battle.  <br /> <br />I am sure the conditions were as depictited as in the movie because I think the author did allot of homework, and the sets for the movie were incredible.  I am a historian of sorts concerning the middle ages, but now I get a very good view of what life is like in the early nineteenth century from this movie, at least on the high seas. I have not read the books, but I think I will now, because as always, the books are so much more captivating and fullfilling in the pictures the author is trying to convey.  <br /> <br />If you like a swashbuckling tale which just puts you right there in the action, this movie is for you!  I hope you have gained some insight about the movie by my thoughts and I apologize if I have offended anyone with my statements about military life.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Overall, i am not a big fan of the modern rock coming out these days. However, after hearing \\"How You Remind Me\\" on the radio,i really liked it and went out and puchased Silver Side Up. I enjoyed pretty much the entire album so when i saw that The Long Road was being released, I decided to give it a shot. I was not the slightest bit dissapointed. The album is filled with a whole bunch of rockin songs with good meledies that you can help but crank up and sing along to. My personal favorite from the album is \\"Do This Anymore\\", a rocking song where chad Kroger really shows off his awesome voice with his combination of singing softly and his ability to belt out lyrics with power while not making it seem like he is just straight out screaming. Other favorites on the album include \\"Someday\\", yes its overplayed but still good, \\"Feeling Way Too Damn Good\\", and of coarse \\"Figured You Out\\" (how can anybody not like that song). so if you liked Silver Side Up than i strongly recemend going out and buying this album
B00000IQW5|3.0|It is a real pity that such interesting initial premise has fallen in common places without creative flight.<br />You can notice this work as a crossroad between the wings of desire and Heaven can wait but with a great difference the movie still remains in a contemplative mood and the worst of all : it has not any substance .<br />The tears can not become in a river . I still wonder how this film has the sign of Spielberg .<br />I love Holy Hunter acting . She loads the screen with her expressive force , but Dreyfus does not seem run parallel to her . Hunter as Frances Mc Dormand need a stronger presence actoral due her inner spontaneous force . We can think in that age in Daniel Day Lewis , James Caan , Ray Liotta , Tom Berenger or Robert Downey Jr , the results could be different .<br />Brad Johnson looks inexpressive, and James Spader, Rutger Hauger or William Hurt were perfect for this demanding role .<br />The script is too obvious and unnecesary tearful. You notice the absence of secondary characters and parallel secondary lines which supported the story . To make that poetic film you need mich more than simply special effects ; you need poetic tapture and commitment .<br />The original idea was very promising . The hommage to the brave flying fireman simply does not appear .<br />Audrey Hepburn made her last appearance in screen and after watching all this film you miss her undoubtly and I would have wished a best result in this sense .
B000023VR6|5.0|To all of you mother f***ers who say Dre is a sellout. I say F*** YOU. What the hell you expect him to do. You all come down on him just because hes smart enough to go corperate, make his money, and realize his dreams. F*** YOU. Anyone who hates on Dre would be lucky to be half the man he is. And what the hell do you all try and prove?? All that callin him a teenybop mainstream pop sellout just give publicity. Your doin him a god damn favor. Dre helped make rap what it is, and everyone comes down on him for tryin something new, if it wasnt for him you dumb f***s wouldnt know the difference between what hes doin now and what he did 10 years ago. If you cant respect someone for livin it up, makin their money, and workin hard for it. Then youll never repect anyone worth havin respect for. This album is one of the best. To all you haters F*** YOU
B00002E233|4.0|I don't have a fondness for gore, or horror (these days), but this wasn't so bad. I know this movie won't win any awards for acting and plot, but I still think it's pretty decent. Whoever cast LL Cool J gave him the best lines in the film, which were most of the funny ones and he does a great job landing them. I like ocean movies and this one offers some really cool effects. In this, you can let go of reality for a while, maybe imagine yourself in a similar, seemingly no-win situation, feel the tension and the suspense. Of course they're not real sharks, but they're pretty good effects. At least in Deep Blue Sea, the \\"typical\\" isn't so typical. Those you may think will still be around by the end, aren't. Surprise!
B000286RNY|5.0|Shaolin Soccer is your typical Bad News Bears type story. It involves six masters of kung fu that have broken apart from each other and are working dead end jobs. The Walter Mathau type role of the broken down has been turned coach, goes to a washed up soccer star from twenty years ago that agreed to throw a championship game, and then had his leg permanently injued by an angry mob of fans. One of the masters, who has nicknamed himself Steel Leg, showcases what he can do, and convinces the coach to agree to form a team with him. Steel Leg then goes to his other five \\"brothers\\" as he calls them, and convinces them to quit their jobs and form a team. The masters go from knowing nothing about soccer, to becoming masters of it by using their knowledge of kung fu towards the game. <br /> <br />Shaolin Soccer is probably one of the best movies I have seen in the last couple of years. It involves a very nice mix of comedy, great special effects, and action sequences. I am not a big fan of soccer at all, but I must say that it came off quite well in this movie. It was very entertaining and interesting to see kung fu mixed together with it. Perhaps the film's best feature is the unbelieveable special effects that were used. Although some of the sequences used are over the top, the special effects are so good, that the sequences come off looking realistic. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Shaolin Soccer had a limited release in theaters. However, I highly recommend it. The DVD includes both the original Chinese version of the film with all the footage included, and the version that was released in U.S. theaters. Although I prefer watching the original version with subtitles, it is nice to be able to watch the theatrical version with the english language track when you don't feel like reading The extras for the DVD are somewhat limited. But, with how low the price is, and with how good the film is, there is no way you can pass this one up. <br /> <br />A solid 5 stars!!
6305232660|4.0|I know this one often gets compared to Armageddon, and although they're similar in theme, they're really different movies. Both are flawed of course, but each one is good in it's own way. Deep Impact concentrates more on how the characters react to the dire situation (of an asteroid heading towards Earth). Armageddon concentrates more on the action and heroics of those sent to \\"save the world.\\" Each has exceptional special effects, and a pretty good cast. I guess which one I like best depends on my mood.  I'm less upset to watch Bruce Willis' character meet his fate on the asteroid (Hey, Liv still has Ben right? She'll be fine) than I am to see Tea' Leoni and her father (played by Maximilian Schell) face a tidal wave. It's not all \\"great\\" acting, mind you, but each has it's moments. I like the human aspect, the effects, the actors, and the story. Inevitably, whenever I see an Earth-related disaster movie, I feel compelled to check the IMDb message board for the brainiac post(s) stating why that particular disaster could or couldn't happen. Silly I guess. But truth or not, its nice to debunk a fear with another opinion. (yep, even if it could be wrong!)
B00005QGAT|5.0|\\"Off the Wall\\" came out in 1979, a time period where Jackson was very busy with not only his brother band \\"The Jacksons\\", but also was trying to break into the movie business. However, the timing and his age (21) at the time made for a great time to launch his solo career. In 1979 so many manufactured sounding disco bands were polluting the airwaves that something fresh was needed. Enter in Quincy Jones and a young, excited, and energetic Michael, at the age where he entered adulthood, and \\"Off the Wall\\" was truly an off the chain excellent release. <br /> <br />While \\"Thriller\\" might have won more awards and received more airplay, and while later albums might be more complex and diverse in sound, \\"Off the Wall\\" was Michael at his most fun. Jones made sure that the sound was polished and new, but not to the extreme point. Jackson went on to capture the dance-floor audience with club ready hits such as the blazing \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\" (a number one hit), \\"Working Day and Night\\", \\"Get on the Floor\\", the title track, and \\"Burn this Disco Out.\\" Jackson also showed he was a jack of all trades, and while he could conceive perfect dance music for the party and club scene, that he could also conceive smooth R & B and soul. \\"Rock with You\\" is a mid-tempo song with lots of soul and a smooth sound. It went on to hit number one as well. \\"I Can't Help It\\", a song written by Stevie Wonder, is another song full of soul. \\"Girlfriend\\" shows hints of the pop Michael that would blow up to superstardom (figuratively and literally) after \\"Thriller\\". \\"She is Out of my Life\\" is one of Michaels top ballads. The pain and hurt of the lyric make for a very sad song, a far cry from the ballads that he puts out today where you don't know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br />The album, for the most part, has a very happy feel to it. It's fun to listen to, dance to, and sing along with. Look at the cover, and you see a young, handsome Michael, ready to take on the music world. It's too bad that same 21 year old today is a troubled 45 year old.  <br /> <br />\\"Off the Wall\\" would lay the foundation for the superior \\"Thriller\\" to make it's mark. Though his later work would reek of paranoia and weirdness, this and \\"Thriller\\" show of the young, fun Michael Jackson, who would make his mark first as a musicial legend, and later as a side show clown.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Honestly! If your a republican, then WHY do you act so surprised when it offends you? Now I'm not gonna attack republicans, this is a DVD review, but.....just a little word of advice. If you didn't like the movie, or if you are a Pro-Bush person, Don't give me a hard time, ITS JUSt A REVIEW, and to be fair and balanced, I will actually take the Republican perspective as a sub review.<br /><br />Democratic View:<br /><br />Okay, When I saw this movie, I thought the beginning was a little commercialised, but it was well made. When Mike Moore does a film, he always starts with a very good beginning. As the film progresses, we see all that we thought had happened, but never really confirmed. Yes, Bush did actually take a vacation the first days in office, I actually have the taped news report from 2000, and no, it definatly wasn't FOX. With the progression of the film we also bear whitness to alot of opinions from a wide variety of people, the most compelling to me, was the homless woman, screaming at the white house, one of those moments. Also, another thing that was brought to our knowlege is that, however \\"Brave\\" our solders are...They are mostly men. and alot of those men joined the army as some gung-ho fancey. Now don't get me wrong, some of our troops have joined for noble causes, but there are those few, racist, wicked men, who just want to shoot some muslims, either because of the sterio-type that all muslims are terrorists, or due to religious belief. Now, in many a review i have seen the terms \\"Bucket of Lies\\"  \\"No informational Value\\" and \\"Just a Bush-bashing Film with no sence of Truth\\" I just want to say, This does have informational value, It ISNT complete lies, and there is some truth to what moore has said. Now, could this be a vendetta film? Perhaps..but if it is...its the best damn vendetta film i ever saw. The thing is...It is a very well made film, regarless of content. Somewhere in the middle of the film , we meet a very republican mother, whos very proud of her son whos over in Iraq. Then one day, he dies, and WHAM! her entire perspective changes, We see a group of solders in a tank, ready to bombard a city, and of all the songs they can play, the listen to \\" Let the Mother F**kers burn\\" We see what might have been, we see what could have been, and we see that as americans, we are only human.<br /><br />Now for the republican stand point:<br /><br />As many of you put it: This was a pure anti-bush film. Mike Moore seems to hate almost everything, and you can tell. This movie was Bush-Bash after Bush Bash after Bush-Bash, and didn't even give republicans the benifit of the doubt. We see what could be proof of a vendetta when bush turns down Moore, in a confrence telling him to \\"Get a life\\" He probably should, but you have to admit: He's made it pretty good so far. Along with what seems to be vastly embellished truth, also, Moore always seems to want to put in vastly greusome pictures to proove his point. Another thing, I don't think anyone should bring polotics to the emmys, no matter what you opinion is, but moore seemed to deem it absolutly fit, so here you go. As far as alot of the material goes in the movie, it seems moore expects to change everyone's beliefs, but to be liberal, shouldn't you have to let people believe what they want to? Isnt that, like a rule or something? who knows, but one thing is certain, this movie has caused quite the ruccus, be that a bad thing or a good thing.<br /><br />To end my review, I would like to call apon the Great Charlie Chaplin, to give us a word of advice, We ALL need.<br /><br />\\"The Great Dictator\\"<br /><br />We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.<br /><br />We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.The way of life can be free and beautiful.But we have lost the way.Greed haspoisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.<br /><br />We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.<br /><br />Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.<br /><br />The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say \\"Do not despair\\".<br /><br />The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish...<br /><br />Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.<br /><br />Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.<br /><br />In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written \\" the kingdom of God is within man \\" - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you, the people.<br /><br />You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.<br /><br />Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!<br /><br />Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting - the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.<br /><br />The soul of man has been given wings - and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope - into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up.

B00028HBKM|2.0|I just thought this movie was bloody and violent. That's it. The Last Temptation is so much better. I forget the director's name but see that movie instead. I am sure you can find it on video.
B000002USN|3.0|This album features Frank and a number of \\"modern\\" hitmakers.Overall this is a fine album but some of the pairings just don't seem to work.eg.What Now My Love  gets downright annoying! <br />Hi-lites include Summer Wind,I've Got You Under My Skin and The Lady Is A Tramp. <br />Surprisingly New York New York doesn't work as well as you think it would.
B000003TAR|5.0|MasterShake, you are so wrong, you couldn't be more wrong. Alice in Chains came out way before Godsmack did, and just for the record Godsmack sis horrible. Nirvana came out nearly 8 years before Puddle of Mudd which isn't Grunge. Grunge died when Kurt died. But back to the album, this is the greatest Grunge CD ever, not one song on this CD is sub- par. Nirvana is the greatest Grunge band ever period, all who think otherwise can check out their CD sales numbers, then check back with me.
B000000OQF|1.0|If this was music...let's just say I'm glad it's not. <br />Flash in the pan band with no real talent.
B00005RY7X|5.0|When you listen to this album and don't try to take it too seriously, you realize this album just kicks ass. There's no getting around it, the album just totally kicks ass and the fact that it's so upbeat makes it even more fun.  <br /> <br />I've heard people say it sounds like a throwback to the 80's. Well, I've never heard any 80's bands rock as hard as AWK. The man writes the dumbest songs in the world and doesn't care what you think about it. But, as allmusic.com said, you'll either hate it because its the dumbest thing you've ever heard, or you'll love it because its the dumbest thing you've ever heard. I for one love it. <br /> <br />And, if you ever get the chance, go to one of his concerts. There's a good chance you'd get to meet him, since he loves talking to his fans. I would take the opportunity, since he puts on a kickass show and he's a great guy to talk to.
B0002IU988|5.0|Hey there I just wanted to add my review to this and thanks for reading it!  <br /> <br />Now lately I've been into harder stuff (Think Lamb of God, Avenged Sevenfold, Unearth, God Forbid.. that kind of heavy metal) but this CD has hit home with me! As a fellow guitarist, Mark Tremonti hit it on the head with this cd.. I love how he has hard, heavy riffs and especially the shredding!! And I'm so glad that Brian Marshall is back! I've missed his bass lines..  <br /> <br />This CD also has something for everyone.. Heavy songs, slow songs, in between songs.. It's perfect!
B00024BHTC|1.0|This has got to go down as one of the worst albums of 2004.  17 used already up for sale says it all.
B000005YZM|5.0|If there were 10 Stars every single one would be earned by this excellent piece of British Psych-Pop from 1968. Even though the band was kaput by the time this was released, \\"Odyssey & Oracle\\" actually lived on to built itself quite a reputation as a (and I hate this overly-used term) masterpiece. But, I have to say it fits in this case. A legendary piece of rock n' roll history. <br /> <br />The melodies and harmonies and arrangements are stellar. Right out of the gate with the whistful \\"Care Of Cell 44,\\" and onto the excellent \\"A Rose For Emily\\" you just hear that you are in the presence of greatness. \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\" is right on the mark and one of the best songs the Zombies ever recorded. Another killer track is the beautiful \\"Beechwood Park\\" which is about as close to perfect as a song can be.  <br /> <br />And those are just the first FOUR tracks! Each song that follows can stand on its own merits and once all the pieces are put together into one complete musical statement, you really have a near perfect album. One BIG bold, beautiful statement! <br /> <br />Of course, the big hit from this one was the now-famous \\"Time Of The Season.\\" However, no matter what season it is outside, you'll feel the warm summer sun throughout as you listen to track after track. A true joyful experience start to finish. <br /> <br />This album is sometimes compared to the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" - and there are similarities. But I think \\"Odessey\\" far outshines that one. As far as '60's greats, it ranks up there with \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" (Beatles) \\"Forever Changes,\\" (Love) \\"Are You Experienced\\" (Jimi Hendrix Experience), \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" (Jefferson Airplane), \\"The Doors\\" (The Doors) and \\"Cheap Thrills\\" (Big Brother & The Holding Company) just to name a few. <br /> <br />And to top it off the liner notes and photos in this 30th Anniversary Edition are very informative and interesting and really add a final stroke to this musical piece of art. What a great ride from a way-too-short-lived band. Highly recommended!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Anime Vs. Disney. Anime Vs. Disney. Anime Vs. Disney. <br /> <br />Who gives a damn? <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"Spirited Away\\" follows the story of Chihiro (AKA Sen) as she is separated from her parents during their move to a new town, and her subsequent adventures in the Spirit World. Along the way she makes some friends, defeats some enemies and tries her hardest to be reunited with Mom and Dad, and get home. <br /> <br />The first and most important thing about \\"Spirited Away\\" is the quality of the storyline. In my opinion, it fulfills more of the \\"Kids-Movies-For-Adults\\" criteria than any of the Harry Potters to date, becuase of the truly universal themes contained therein - love, loss, family bonds, friendship - and becuase of the innate charm and beautifully-crafted characterisation of the characters. Chihiro is a plucky and adventurous girl, Haku is her straight-laced mystical counterpart, Yubaba is perhaps the most enjoyable villainess since Disney's Maleficent. The story unfolds with a total lack of pretension and a gentle, yet enthralling, pace, and the whole shebang moves with such an elegant and effortless grace that we are begging to be taken along for the ride. <br /> <br />Animation-wise, if \\"Shrek 2\\" is the current king of CGI, then the hand-drawn crown absolutely must go to \\"Spirited Away\\". The first thing we notice is the glorious colour of the Spirit world, the hodgepodge of western and eastern architectural styles and the straight-from-a-child's-imagination renderings of Yubaba and her consort Gods are all flawless in their movement. Hand-drawn animation may be a dying art form, but with such a brilliant and beautiful swan song as this, it will never be forgotten. Even those of us without an understanding of the Hand-Drawn animation process can only sit back and be amazed at the quality and clarity of Chihiro, Haku, Yubaba et al. Landscapes and interiors chew on the scenery all by themselves, and provide a visually enthralling stage against which thewonderful players tell us the story.  <br /> <br />To wonder if our children will enjoy \\"Spirited Away\\" is, I believe, an insult to their powers of imagination and cognition - this is a timeless and classic tale full of familiar themes and top-notch characters, and, when it's done with such an endearing naivete, I'd never once hesitate to recommend \\"Spirited Away\\" to the parents of any child, any age, and from any culture. <br /> <br />A classic that must be seen to be understood, and thoroughly recommended.
0743454529|5.0|The idea of \\"literary fiction\\" generally makes me ill. It's a pretentious and self-righteous term that seems to say \\"this is much more important than anything you're reading.\\" <br />Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is literary in the very best sense. Every word is art. Every sentence is crafted like a Ming vase.  <br />This book is beauty and emotion and tears wrapped up in pages and ink. I sat in Barnes and Noble for seven hours, unable to put it down. I finished it before I left, but I still bought it, and started again on page 1 when I got home.  <br />If you never read another piece of literary fiction, read this one. Twice.
0393317552|1.0|This book is very disappointing.<br /><br />First, the title is misleading. Diamond pays very little attention to \\"guns and steel\\". Diamond in his geographic determinism focuses mainly on domestic(able) crops and animals.<br /><br />Second, it is more a college textbook than a pop science book. It reads as a series of lectures. The style of writing is dull, some fact are repeated over and over. There is even a \\"test\\" included at the end of the book in a form of reading group guide discussion questions (\\"Why did almonds prove domestic able while acorns were not? What significance this have?\\").<br /><br />Third, Diamond lumps Europe and Asia into Eurasia - that allows him to sidestep a question why it was Europe and not Asia that colonized most of the world.<br /><br />Finally, some of the reviewers on Amazon.com summarize the main ideas of the book very well. It is a better reading than Guns, Germs and Steel.
B000002KH3|5.0|Dont diss Eddie Van Halen like that. I find it hard to believe youve listened to this album and call his solos \\"tasteless\\". Ever happen to listen to \\"Eruption\\"? Your stupid, its not others that know little about guitar playing, its you. This coming from a guitar player that plays a lot of AC/DC, Van Halen, and Black Sabbath at gigs.<br /><br />Eddie Van Halen is amazing, theres a lot of amazing guitar players out there, but Eddie has been named the greatest guitar player of all time by numerous magazines and tv stations. Your stupid Ilia, you dont deserve to get to listen to great music like this, f*ck off.
B000003TA4|2.0|Want an album with passion? Melodious chaos? Actual purpose? Then Nirvana ain't for you or anyone you know. Maybe for your enemies though (it might even make them more ignorant than they already are). Nirvana's not worth anyone's time or attention when so many other bands out there with actual creativity have been neglected. I'm sick of seeing innovative, worthwhile bands who toil endlessly for regular gigs get passed over for a trio of untalented, lazy slobs who want to be the next Nirvana. Kurt Cobain set the bar as low as he could get away with, and the public just ate up every moan and whine that came from his slimy lips. The public still does. Any and all of the praise showered on this man for killing himself is sickening. Despite what Rolling Stone and MTV tell you, he certainly doesn't \\"live on\\" because of his music. He \\"lives on\\" because he killed himself. Nowadays, because of Cobain, any pimple-flecked reject with a guitar, no talent, and a nasally whine can get a record deal. Nirvana deserved none of the praise they garnered, especially for the paint-by-numbers Rock music on Nevermind. There's no way in hell that Nirvana can been categorized as Punk either. They lacked all motivation needed to make a statement, so therefore, they're not Punk. Nirvana is Rock purely for \\"deep\\" Jocks who don't realize they're Jocks. I think I'll suggest a little Fishbone to y'all instead. You mopey kids need some jubilant soul music for the downtrodden, stat. Enjoy. <br /> <br />Fishbone: \\"Truth & Soul\\" <br />Fishbone: \\"The Reality of My Surroundings\\" <br /> <br />
B0000CAQ26|5.0|I can't believe the amount of people who write reviews on here based on the success of an artist's previous album(s).  It is ok for every album to be different, so stop with the comparing already!!!  Now, onto the review.  I am an avid fan of Pink and her talent.  I already have her first 2 cds, and still listen to them frequently.  I will say that I was one of the people who bought \\"Try This\\" when it came out in November.  At first I wasn't sure what to think of it.  There were a few songs that I really enjoyed and others that I wasn't so sure about.  As I started listening to it more, I realized that this album is truly great. No, it's not like her first 2 albums, but that's not a bad thing.  Her combination of rock and pop style makes an extraordinary album.  It is also an awesome work out cd.  I think my favorite songs on this album would have to be \\"Love Song\\", \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\", and \\"Oh My God\\".  She really showcases her ability to produce various kinds of music and I commend her for that.  Go buy the album, it's great!!
B00020JPI6|4.0|At the same time that Hip-O in the U.S. released a cross-label Jackson 5/Jacksons compilation (called \\"The Jacksons Story\\"), Sony and Universal in the UK issued this title.  The differences between the two titles are considerable.  First off the Hip-O collection is only one disc, so it obviously does not include many of the tracks that are available here.  The first disc of this collection (track list below; Amazon's description only shows the tracks on disc two of this collection) focuses on the Jackson 5 and Michael Jackson's years at Motown.  It has all of the big hits that the Hip-O disc has but also contains some album tracks and the hit \\"Lookin' Through the Windows.\\"  The one omission is the Jermaine Jackson hit \\"Let's Get Serious,\\" available on the Hip-O collection but not here. <br /> <br />Disc two focuses on the Jacksons' Epic years.  It's here that this disc really trumps the Hip-O compilation.  Included here is \\"Torture,\\" mysteriously missing from both the Hip-O disc and the \\"Essential Jacksons\\" disc that Sony issued in the U.S. last year.  Also included here are popular Jacksons tracks like \\"Goin' Places,\\" \\"Dreamer,\\" and \\"Even Though You're Gone,\\" the latter two also being missing from Epic's earlier \\"Essential Jacksons.\\"  What's also great about disc two of this collection is that, apart from \\"Lovely One,\\" it contains the original 45 rpm single edits.  (The \\"Essential Jacksons\\" disc contains the full length album versions.) <br /> <br />I am giving this collection only 4 instead of 5 stars because the track selection on disc one could have been better.  Instead of the Jackson 5 singing \\"Doctor My Eyes\\" or \\"Ain't No Sunshine,\\" it would have been nice to have had other hits like \\"Maybe Tomorrow,\\"  \\"Little Bitty Pretty One,\\" and \\"I Am Love\\" or the popular b-side \\"I Found That Girl\\" or the stand-out early Michael Jackson-led \\"Who's Loving You.\\"  It also would have been nice if they had used the original mono mixes for the Motown tracks (they are all stereohere).  The stereo versions are much easier to find on cd.  Given the focus on single edits on disc two, it's curious that the compilers did not pay attention to using the original singles mixes on disc one.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Clapton is one of the most erratic rock/blues stars ever. He could make a masterpiece and then release the worst flop. He could play the guitar like a god, and then sound like his own bad imitator. Clapton credentials as a bluesman cannot be argued: he has been hailed as a master by every blues icon that ever listened to him: From Muddy and Wolf, to Hendrix and SRV. I think what Eric needed here was a good producer, a guy that would be able to stand up to him and say 'excuse me, Mr Clapton, lets try again, and now do it like you mean it'. And for the other musicians, they sound bored as hell. Eric usually plays better when he is challenged, and this band has been playing with him for so long that he is as excited as having lunch with his grandmother. This is such a missed opportunity. Robert Johnson deserves better. Check out the recent tributes by Peter Green and see the difference.
1402555989|5.0|This unabridged cassette version was an excellent listen. The reviewer who said Christopher is like an autistic Adrian Mole hit the nail on the head. Adrian Mole (of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, and others) is a hilariously deadpan, completely oblivious teen whose lack of interest in the world around him makes for some ridiculously blunt diary entries.<br /><br />Christopher's lack of involvement in the world around him and his perceptions of the world beyond his backyard fence make this both a sad and funny look into the mind of a boy with Asperger's.<br /><br />The unabridged cassette version has five cassettes and is narrated engagingly. The male narrator really catches Christopher's character and believingly tells his story.
B000002UAR|5.0|I would like to preface my review by saying that I have arrived at this conclusion after listening to rock music for hours every day, and listening to Revolver for more hours than I care to remember. I have not been bullied into thinking this by snobbish critics...give Revolver a chance and I am sure you will come to agree with me.<br /><br />In my view, Revolver is the only PERFECT record, from a musical standpoint, the Beatles made. All the other albums, including my favorite, Abbey Road, have a clear low point (i.e. \\"Sun King\\"). On Revolver, every track is absolutely stellar, even the Ringo song. \\"Dr. Robert\\" is the weakest song, but it's still good enough for the record as a whole to be considered perfect.<br /><br />It is also VERY different from Rubber Soul, which was basically a folk album, with a lot of acoustic guitars. Revolver is a psychedelic record with a lot of heavy electric guitar and many other instruments (sitar and orchestra). They are nowhere near the same. It is also very dissimilar to all other Beatles albums, one of the amazing strengths of the band. Revolver is, when it comes down to it, a stunning artistic achievement as well as an unforgettable musical journey.<br /><br />Reasons why I believe Revolver is the greatest album of all time:<br /><br />1) Sheer variety and musical experimentation: heavy rock songs (\\"Taxman\\"), slow orchestrated songs (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), psychedelic experimentation (\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\"), even a bit of Motown influence (\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"), silly songs like \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" brilliant guitar rock songs like \\"She Said She Said, gentle ballads like \\"For No One\\" and \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\" and the incomprehensible yet brilliant \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"<br /><br />2) Instrumentation: the instruments are always doing unexpected things - backwards guitar on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", the very moody and dark piano intro to \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" the droning sitar and tabla of \\"Love You To,\\" the searing and repetitive guitar solos of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"She Said She Said,\\" horns and brass sections augmenting the songs (\\"For No One,\\" \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"), even the illusion that a rock song is there when in fact it is simply an orchestra (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), and, subtly but importantly, a very distinct type of drumming, very methodical and almost snare-ish, which you can see on \\"She Said She Said\\" and especially on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" This might be the most complex and fascinating song ever recorded in Western popular music. The \\"Anthology\\" DVD explains the process of creating a tapestry of sound by chopping up backwards guitar, vocals, and many other instruments and randomly feeding them through speakers over John's voice (also fed through a Leslie speaker to get the feel that he was \\"a thousand Buddhist monks singing from a mountaintop\\") and Ringo's very interesting drum pattern. Because it was made using such primitive technology, it cannot be reproduced today. It represents the height of the Beatles' experimentation, and it is also a piece of very puzzling avant-garde art (and it is listenable and enjoyable, unlike trash such as \\"Revolution 9\\"), as well as a timeless piece of the sixties culture (the lyrics come from Timothy Leary's \\"Tibetan Book Of The Dead,\\" and it is supposed to mimic an LSD trip).<br /><br />Add to this the Beatles great songwriting (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is a touching, poignant story filled with haunting imagery), their sense of sheer fun (\\"Yellow Submarine\\") and their power to pen truly warm, beautiful songs (\\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\"), and you have the greatest record of all time.and repetitive guitar solos of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"She Said She Said,\\" horns and brass sections augmenting the songs (\\"For No One,\\" \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"), even the illusion that a rock song is there when in fact it is simply an orchestra (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), and, subtly but importantly, a very distinct type of drumming, very methodical and almost snare-ish, which you can see on \\"She Said She Said\\" and especially on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" <br /> <br />3) \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" This might be the most complex and fascinating song ever recorded in Western popular music.

It represents the height of the Beatles' experimentation, and it is also a piece of very puzzling avant-garde art (and it is listenable and enjoyable, unlike trash such as \\"Revolution 9\\"), as well as a timeless piece of the sixties culture (the lyrics come from Timothy Leary's \\"Tibetan Book Of The Dead,\\" and it is supposed to mimic an LSD trip). <br /> <br />Add to this the Beatles great songwriting (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is a touching, poignant story filled with haunting imagery), their sense of sheer fun (\\"Yellow Submarine\\") and their power to pen truly warm, beautiful songs (\\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\"), and you have the greatest record of all time.
1592400876|5.0|I think some of the other reviewers skipped the introduction to the American version. This book isn't meant to show Americans how to use grammar and punctuation, it is meant as a humorous and commiserating book for those of us who always notice signs like:<br /><br />Chocolate \\"Raspberry\\" Truffle's, $1.00<br /><br />Taken as a humor book about punctuation, it is hilarious and well-written, even more so for those of us who love the slang and language differences in other countries.<br /><br />It isn't meant as an instruction book for Americans. A lot of the examples and rants would have lost their charm if translated into American English, so it is better than American editors kept their hands off of it and just gave us the funny British version. She represents such a British cultural phenomenon it would have been a shame to spoil it with Americanization.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I was expectin' the best when I bought this cd few days ago.. <br />I've been listening to some of his productions on other artists and its hot! He's a rapper and producer to look out for this year. <br /> <br />The album is such a killer! Kanye's beats are tight and awesome. From track 1-21 there'll never be one of 'em that you gonna skip cuz everything just flows. The intro sounds like Eddie Murphy's voice in Nutty Professor lol. The standout songs are Never Let Me Down, Jesus Walks, Slow Jamz, Spaceship, School Spirit and Family Business. The final track clocks up to 12 min+ but its worth listening to what Kanye has to say when Rocafella refused to sign him when he played 'Jesus Walks' LOL.  <br /> <br />Almost all the skits are pretty hilarious especially the part on degrees and school. The guest rappers in this album are not very heavy; all contributing with their own style.  <br />Amazing production, an album worth diggin' and its a must for hip hop fans.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Lenin once said that a \\"lie told often enough becomes the truth.\\"  The KGB even had a name for it: \\"dezinformatsiya.\\"  Disinformation included a variety of techniques and activities to promote false or misleading information to promote an agenda.  Webster defines disinformation as \\"false information deliberately spread (as if by planting rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.\\"  I hereby nominate Fahrenheit 9/11 for an award: the Best Dezinformatsiya of 2004. I rate this film with five stars as the best example of propaganda I've ever seen (next to Bowling for Columbine).

0156027321|5.0|A sweet story about a victim of fate who simply chose not to remain a victim. The primal is woven tightly with the spiritual, forming of these disparate threads a life-affirming tapastry that can be used as a security blanket to comfort any seeker who has lost touch  with the underlying goodness of life.
B00005JNEI|5.0|With those words, Bush showed his true colors and his true allegiance......and it ain't to the flag or the American people, folks.  WAKE UP!  This man is by and for THE RICH....and his own business interests. If you saw this movie you would understand that.  And if you didn't, quit your bellyaching 'cause you don't know what you're talking about.  No matter what you think of Michael Moore (and I'll admit some of his footage was shameless propaganda and had no place in a serious, hardcore documentary) you can't ignore the news-reel footage (most of which the American public never had a chance to see) and the documentation.  This movie is a call for the general public to take their heads out of the sand and take a long, hard look at the smokescreen of American politics.
0553260111|5.0|This book is excellent, and it is so thrilling that there is nowhere subtle enough to stop at! It is very different from the movie but better in my opinion.
6304077955|5.0|The subject matter of this film can be harsh (2 rape scenes, several beatings and other sex scenes) but I defy you to take your eyes off it.  I watched this film 3 times in one weekend and I got something different out of it every time.  All the performances are magnificent but David Thewlis is incredible.  Just like real life, you wonder what makes him tick but you never quite find out.  Some of my favorite scenes are those with no dialogue where the camera just watches him standing outside a tube station or reading that stolen book.  I loved watching his character question why we're here, asking things that aren't polite but are vital.  Criterion, please, please, please release a DVD with commentary by Mike Leigh and David Thewlis!!!
0399103422|5.0|Sorry about that. I couldn't resist. A very good book, I was surprised how much they added to the movies, but no loose ends. Very intriguing detail into the Mafia, makes you wonder about that Mario Puzo ;)
B0001Z363W|5.0|In this fury of wanna be rockers worried about their image and afraid to sing about anything but high school girl troubles comes Black Label Society.  Zakk Wylde speaks his soul and shows off his incredible guitar talent.  The songs are touching, while other tracks still have that party hard, heavy metal feel.  House of Doom, combines acoustics with a metal interlude that will blow you a way.  A great CD if you are looking for true musical talent.

B00003CXCT|5.0|First let me start by saying I am a true Star Wars fan if ever there was one. It was the very first movie I ever saw in the theatre. I was three years old, R2-D2 came on screen and I was trying to talk to him, I didn't realize he wasn't really there. At anyrate the world of Star Wars that George Lucas created is in a class all its own. However it is his world, he didn't write it and create it and flim it for you or me, he did it for himself. If we all watch it and loved it great, if not so what, it was a story he wanted tell. I have seen so many interviews with the man where he says he was never truly happy with the way the original movies turned out. technology has advanced and now he can go back and do it his way. \\"Go for it George.\\" None of his edits to the original movies have taken away from the telling of the story one bit. I truly appreciate what he is trying to do. I will gladly scarf up the DVD's when released and encourage any Star Wars fan to do the same.
B000003C2S|5.0|Bottomline: If you're into ANY kind of METAL or just a serious <br />Rock Music Lover, YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS ONE ! ! ! ! <br /> <br />In my opinion THE VERY BEST ALBUM put out by Chuck (R.I.P.) <br />True thier production would definitly get better in later  <br />albums....But there's just a BRUTAL BEAUTY to this album that <br />has to be heard.....EXQUISITE guitar playing by James Murphy... <br />Chuck also shreds on this album......Songs like WITHIN THE MIND, <br />SPIRITUAL HEALING show us the maturing of Chuck.....Along <br />with the straight forward LIVING MONSTROSITY,DEFENSIVE PERSONALIES....My personal favorite is the last track KILLING <br />SPREE....But the whole album KICKS ASS....You won't find <br />yourself skipping tracks with this cd....YOU JUST WON'T BE <br />DISAPPOINTED ! ! ! !   DEATH RULES ! ! ! ! !

B0000TB01Y|5.0|With an absolutely astounding score by Stephen Schwartz, Wicked surpasses all musical expectations in this fabulous novel about two young women learning about life and friendship. All audiences will find this soundtrack appropriate and, in turn, would find the Broadway show incredible. And if you especialy love guy/girl or girl/girl duets, this CD is for you. Enjoy the perfect mix of beautiful harmonies and haunting melodies in a musical production you will never forget.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Of the three works in \\"Memories\\", each is extremely different and contribute to a very entertaining and thought-provoking work as a whole. <br />\\"Magnetic Rose\\" combines beatiful artistry and harrowing audio and visual effects to create an ambience like something from a work by M. Night Shaymalan. The masterful audio score by the musical genius Yoko Kanno contributes greatly to the short. Both chilling and provocative, \\"Magnetic Rose\\" is the overall best from the three works in \\"Memories\\" <br />\\"Stink Bomb\\" is purely entertaining. Right from the start, we as viewers connect with the poor pharmaceutical researcher we see before us and his plight throughout this very comical and incredulous short. The music as well helps keep a \\"groove\\" as the movie flows smoothly throughout.  <br />\\"Cannon Fodder\\" is easily the most under-appreciated work of the three. Much reminiscient of the WWII \\"Maus\\" comic written by a Jew after his experiences in Nazi-occupied Germany, \\"Cannon Fodder\\" takes us to a world that is not full of ghosts and spaceships, nor unbelievable biochem weapons, but a world not too much unlike our own- where people are vulnerable and controlled by unseen forces. It is the most thought provoking, and its style is completely apart from popular animation styles of today. The most intersting part is that the movie is one cut- meaning the backrground flows entirely throughout the movie without the scene in front us chaging suddenly. <br />As a whole, \\"Memories\\" offers something for everybody- from the scary moviegoer to the saturday night funny flick watcher to the ponderous artist- definitely worth 2 hours of your time.
B0001ME5L2|1.0|well...Avril is a nice girl,very pretty, very neat...but she has to decide herself about what kind of girl she wants to be, because that kind of nice girl,skating dude,punk rocker,romantic lady, bad (...)stuff is driving many people crazy! Avril sweety...grow up.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander is the stunning epic tale of the British ship Surprise and its mission to find and defeat an enemy French vessel during the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series of books. And when I heard the film was out upon DVD, I had to watch it.  Visually- I thought Master and Commander was stunning. In particular Russell Crowe as \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey. The crew were well portrayed, and the ships and cinematography quite simply gorgeous. My one and only disappointment was the character of Doctor Maturin (Paul Bettany). For one thing. Where's his wig? Maturin always wore a wig. Second, the character was supposed to be Irish, and quite a bit more eccentric than he is portrayed in the film. This Maturin was quite normal, and even rather dull. Hmmm... Not how I envisioned this character. The actor couldn't even muster an accent!<br /><br />At any rate, the film was an excellent but shallow taste of the Aubrey/Maturin saga. If you like what you see here. Read the books. They explore the characters of Aubrey and Maturin in detail, and contain much more than just battles... But an excellent glimpse of what it was like to sail the seas in the 1800's.
B00024BHTC|4.0|Although Tarja's voice was toned down a lot in this album, Nightwish, as a whole has progressed far enough that they have created a very powerful and unique album. I don't have any major gripes with the album. All the songs are great by themselves and work even better when listened to together (one after another). <br /> <br />Kuolema tekee taiteilijan is the only song that I feel doesn't deliver as good as it could have. Even though I feel this, the song is beautiful alone because of Tarja's voice. <br /> <br />Anywho, if you like Nightwish, I'm sure you'll find something you like on this album.
B0001XWV12|3.0|Another in a long line of \\"American Pie\\"-type high school/college \\"party movies\\", Eurotrip takes the basic plot of its predecessor, Road Trip, and places it in a European setting.  While this offering is funny in its own right, it's not as memorable as Road Trip, although it is a bit raunchier. <br />Fresh from graduating high school, Scotty is dumped by his girlfriend.  Soon after, he discovers (albeit in weird fashion) that his German penpal is his true love, and in a moment of spontenaiety, decides to travel to Berlin to meet her.  He tows his sex-starved best friend Cooper along, and they meet up with other friends, fraternal twins Jenny and Jamie (note: the \\"worst twins ever\\").  Every stereotypical thing about each place they visit along the way (of note, Amsterdam, London, Paris, and Bratislava(!)) is shined upon, and attempted hilarious mayhem ensues in each locale as Scotty tries to hook up with the girl of his dreams while avoiding international incidents.  Cameos abound in this flick, from Matt Damon (see if you can recognize him) to Lucy Lawless to Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show), which adds to the fun. <br />Eurotrip has a couple of drop-dead funny moments, but for the most part this film tries to capitalize on the frat-house demographic success of Road Trip, and falls just short.  Jacob Pitts (Cooper) tries to recreate one of the roles that made Seann William Scott famous, and though he brings a sort of uniqueness to his character, he's just not as good at the sidekick role as Scott.  There is a good Scott in this one, though; Scott Mechlowicz plays the hopeless romantic pretty well, and I actually felt like cheering him on in some parts.  There are really no standout characters in Eurotrip (except maybe the creepy Italian tourist the group runs into in each city), and the whole thing just seems like a rehash.  Not that it's a completely bad thing; it is a funny movie, and if you liked Road Trip, you'll get a kick out of this one too.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is a much over hyped film that plays on the marketability of its two main stars, Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton.<br /><br />After watching trailers for this film, I was given the expectation of a witty, clever film.  Unfortunately, it is little of the sort.  The handful of amusing scenes or lines are in the trailer and the film itself drags slowly to a maudlin conclusion.  There are no high points.  The film simply encourages the view to keep checking to the time in the hope that a merciful end is close.<br /><br />Both Nicholson and Keaton are better actors than this film allows them to play.
0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith is a valuable (and timely) handbook for thinkers - it challenges and informs. Even comes with detailed notes that are as thought provoking as the main text. That's rare. Plus, it's well written and a pleasure to read. Life seems to be a dance of neurons and photons constructed by our brain/nervous system; this much we may agree. The HOW and WHO of that dance seems to be where the lines are being drawn these days - who worships the \\"correct\\" god. This is the problem of our times. We no longer use swords to impose our god on the faithless, we have 21st century weapons - and that means mass destruction. What part does faith play in the drama? I bought this book because I am interested. I was not disappointed.    I was particularly impressed with the sections about \\"moderate\\" Christians and the connection between beliefs and behavior; a special interest of mine for some time. It's plausible to consider (at least since 9/11, I think) that moderate religionists are as dangerous in some ways as extremists; they don't do the dirty work (suicide bombings, legal attacks on civil liberties, human rights violations, women's rights violations, etc)  but they uphold religious belief systems from which the extremists emerge (extremists were indoctrinated children once upon a time). Harris addresses this issue to my satisfaction, and does it without succumbing to cheap shots or mean spiritedness. The Christian apologetics folks will find this book challenging. On page 23 Mr. Harris writes: \\"In fact, every religion preaches the truth of propositions for which no evidence is even conceivable. This puts the \\"leap\\" in Kierkegaard's leap of faith.\\"    The problem with Islam is attended to at some length as well. If you're not familiar with the Koran and the hadith, you'll be treated to a sampling that will make you wonder which century these folks live in - the fourteenth or the twenty-first. The sections on Islam are worth the price of the book alone if your interestedin jihad and martyrdom belief systems. Not to be left out in regards to the consequences of faith, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism get their treatment too. To put it simply, the cruelty human beings are capable of in the name of faith is beyond comprehension - at least for most of us.    There's something here for the scientific mind as well. Investigations into the nature of consciousness, neuroscience, meditation - these are some of the topics I found interesting and informative. Regardless of your point of view on religious matters (Abu Ghraib and US foreign policy even), this book should be an educational and positive experience if you like brain workouts.       Fundamentalists (we know many are religionists, scientists, and atheists - those folks who have this infinitely complex universe figured out once and for all, case closed) will probably storm the citadel on this one. I can see one star ratings coming like a midnight mob on the trail of a heretic. Don't let single star ratings sway you away from this important book. I'm keeping The End of Faith handy for reference. I gave it an easy 5 stars. The message is really one of hope - not blind faith where reason and evidentiary hearings of our beliefs are suppressed because of dogma. Now I'm thinking we might even make it through the 21st century without the Apocalypse or Armageddon ruining our day. This writer, I think, is doing his part to save us from ourselves.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|Take one part single all based around an E chord and add in generic lyrical content.  Sell said single as being \\"the next big thing,\\" as being representative of indie music.  Toss around words like inventive, creative, original, retro, garage rock revival, etc.  Do absolute best to keep people from shouting the word derivative.  Compare with bands who have been able to clearly show their influences and gain critical acclaim despite that.  Toss in 10 other songs that sound almost exactly like the single (it would be horrid for people to hear the radio single and then find out the album doesn't all sound like that...see Modest Mouse's Float On, a very similar song but luckily not so one-dimensional an album that houses it).  Gain media attention.    Overplay on radio.  Sell many, many albums.  Have critics talk about how \\"indie music\\" is taking over while also missing the huge variety of albums that this label encompasses and that are being released every week with so much more musical talent and ability to stand up to repeated listens.  Make money.  Make end of year lists.  Make more money.  Wait for trend to die out.  Look for next big thing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|and I had the chills from some of the songs.  I had bought the CD knowing I was going to see the musical in the next couple of months.  The music is catchy, strong, fun, and \\"wonderful\\".  It gave me a pretty good idea of what was going on before I saw the musical, and when I saw the show this weekend, it was even better than the CD.  I also cannot wait to see this musical again, and I'll probably play the soundtrack a hundred times more before then.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Words fail me when it comes to this album.  Yeah, it has its one lame rock song (the title cut) just like The Final Cut (Not Now John - anyone?).  But, oh my, is this an amazing album.  Nobody does anything even close to what Roger Waters does.  I can't think of anyone else that has even tried.  This is the true final chapter is one of the greatest trilogies in music (The Wall, The Final Cut and Pros and Cons). Go Fishing is the best thing Roger has ever done and the crime is that nobody is there to hear it! <br />
0783117523|5.0|I didn't even see the whole thing. I tuned in right before the lesbian scene. Not much more to explain. I LOVE this movie!
B000062YB1|1.0|Like i said before... Slayer sucks. I mean, i realy got into slayer when they released \\"reign in blood\\" but then  season in the abyss realy bored me but then they did made me happy with south of heaven then after south of heaven i just remenber being let down by every other slayer album.There realy isn't any good songs here and it will realy bored you alot.If you guys want  good thrash...Get any albums by these bands \\" the haunted\\" , \\"carnal forge\\" , early albums from \\"sepultura\\" but   if you still insist on getting slayer then go with  reign in blood for the most brutal release todate.  Not recommended.
B0001611DI|5.0|I've seen this movie loads of times before but never, ever in a version as good looking and sounding as this fine release from Anchor Bay.  Previously, the cinematography in Romero's landmark film has always looked a bit dull and bland to me but here it really shines with a new lease of life. The colours are rich and the contrast level is spot on. <br />The newly added DTS mix is excellent although not very directional - I suppose the aim was not to stray too far away from the original.  My one gripe with the film itself is the helicopter zombie sequence - it looks ridiculous - anyone else think it looks like Oddbod from Carry on Screaming? <br />Keep 'em coming Anchor bay.
B000062YAZ|4.0|For the idiot who called this deathmetal ? You need to be  shot. Slayer, is not my favorite band and infact... I think their albums are horrible except for this one and south of heaven but the rest pretty much sounds like crap. Reign in blood, is one of the most impressive's thrash album i've heard from a band althought its not very original it still very great to listing to. Make sure you also get south of heaven which was another brilliant release by slayer but do stay away from season in the abyss ,diabolous in musica and god hates us all. Recommended. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|Finally, a film that doesn't slavishly follow the letter of the book, but rather gives the viewer the spirit of it.  To be sure, the story is still there, and though I had a few quibbles with things that weren't explained as well as I thought they should be, on the whole, I think they did a fantastic job of paring the story down to cinematic essentials.<br /><br />What a lot of people do not, and perhaps will not understand is that books are not films and vice versa.  They're very different mediums and require very different approaches.  If you try to translate a book literally to the screen you get a tedious film (HP and the Chamber of Secrets, for example.)  But if the adaptation is done intelligently, and preserves the feel of the universe as well as the essential storylines, then you're likely to have a film worth watching over and over.  PoA is one of the latter.  More than either of the first two, it is rich with a sense of magic.  There's a darkness about it which hints at what's coming, and it builds deftly on already established relationships.  While you can watch this without reference to the books or the first two films, your appreciation of it will be the greater for being familiar with either or both.<br /><br />I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to accept Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.  Richard Harris had made the role so much his own that I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping in.  But I was wrong to worry; Gambon does a superb job here, as do all the others.  Particularly good are David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.<br /><br />As I've said before, of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, fanboys and girls need not apply if they're going to be anal-retentive about what's been excised or changed.  Relax.  Enjoy some excellent cinema.
B000065RMP|5.0|Emotional, electric, symphonic, at times harsh, but vastly beautiful, modern, artistic music from Iceland. Some of their musical influences seem apparant to me, ones which I also love: Pink Floyd, Slowdive, Galaxie 500, Radiohead, and I'm also reminded of the Cure's &quot;Disintegration&quot; at times. The Nordic herritage feels present too, though in what form other than the altered Icelandic language sung, I couldn't point to. I am reminded of Lord of the Rings when I play it, and knowing that Elisha Wood might have bought it, it seems that some of the album's emotion might have come out in his performance in the films. <br />There are horns and pianos used in sections of the album that remind me of Atom Heart Mother (Pink Floyd) and a big symphonic carcophony that's halted by a conductor, before it gets completely out of hand, restoring the quiet and peace of mind. The songs are melodic, the drums, when they are played, smashing. I look forward to seeing Sigur Ros's videos. Apparantly Radiohead are likewise inspired by them.<br />Good to know there's still beautiful alternative music out there being made. Powerfull stuff! If you like the above mentioned bands, you'll be pleased with this great new group.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The Ending (?) to one of the highest selling trilogies in movie history. I was so happy when this movie came on the big screen, as ALL my predictions about what would happen in the final instalment of the Matrix series came true. It's everything you have come to expect from the Matrix movies and a hell of a lot more! Don't be surprised if it sweeps the SFX categories at all upcoming award ceremonies. Matrix fans have no fear, something this good will definitely have another movie made about it. ( A prequel too perhaps? ). <br />In this Saga, Neo and Trinity goes to the machine world to strike a deal to end all deals - peace. The war in zion is one of the best war sci-fi scenes I've ever seen in all my years. <br />It's interesting to note that some Matrix fans still have not seen the ANIMATRIX - as this is a missing jigsaw that fits in with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS. What are you waiting for? - JACK IN!
B000025XKM|5.0|I was a latecomer into Nick Drake's music. As many other people, I re-discovered him \\"thanks\\" to the media hype of recent times. And boy am I happy I did! Nick Drake's music combines the best elements of folk and brit psychodelia.<br /><br />When I listen to Drake, besides entering a peaceful state where I feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe, I remember music from Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith (both, no longer among us as well), Rufus Wainwright and even Cat Stevens...<br /><br />Sad thing, how after thirty years of his passing, a commercial may bring his music back to life, some say. Me, I feel it's all just fine: Nick's posthumous album brings 1972 all back, with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it, making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work, write to or quite simply... sit back and let go.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Okay, apart from the title, which I had to spend 10 minutes on pronouncing correctly, it's not a bad film. There are bits of it which reminded me of the Back to the Future trilogy, though. I think J.K.Rowling is getting a little desperate with her storylines, but it just kept up with my expectations of the film; so for that, it passes the \\"eh!\\" seal of approval. I swear if Alan Rickman (Prince of Thieves, Die Hard) wasn't in this movie, I wouldn't have bothered watching it. BTW, is it me or is there some sexual chemistry between Harry and that english chick?
B000002572|5.0|those people who gave the album less than 5 stars are insane. This album is as good as any ever recorded.     After almost 30 years, I still ocassionally listen to this album and am always impressed.  The arrangements are great, the production is great, Tom's performance is great, Brad Delp's vocals are great...    I just don't hear these \\"flaws\\" that are that are supposedly so evident as to take off points
0451197879|4.0|YES I AGREE THAT THIS IS MORE LOW-KEY THAN MOST OF KING'S WORK, BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. TRULY A CHARACTER STUDY, IN MANY WAYS I FOUND IT SIMILAR TO THE FILM 'ORDINARY PEOPLE' IN THAT IT IS ABOUT A MAN WHO IS SLOWLY COMING APART. THE WRITING STYLE IS AS INTENSE AS EVER, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN IT APART FROM THE PROTAGONIST, BART DAWES. OVERALL, I THINK IT IS A MEDITATION ON DEATH AND WHAT IT MAY MEAN, BUT BELIVE THIS STORY ALSO EXPLORES OTHER THEMES SUCH AS LOSS,  LOVE, DISAPPOINTMENT AND EVEN A STUDY ON OUR MOSTLY HOMOGINISED, LOW-RISK, SOMETIMES EMPTY-SEEMING SURBURBAN WAY OF LIFE IN THE LOUDLY LAUDED WESTERN WORLD. A SUPERIOR NOVELLA, RIGHT UP THERE WITH BOTH THE LONG WALK AND APT PUPIL. FROM A READER BASED NEAR THOSE GREEN PACIFIC WATERS MENTIONED IN ROADWORK.

B000089RVX|5.0|There is no doubt that Evanescence is an amazing band with many elements.But they are constantley being compared to Linkin Park.I really dont understand this comparison.OK,here is the deal/differences.Both singers of these bands are angry in one way or another.Chester presents his anger as it is..screaming and edgy vocals.Amy chanels her anger into more of a melancholy mode,more sad than anything with songs like My Immortal,Hello and Taking Over Me.Amy is the one who dresses her anger,with the dark makeup,whips and chains and died black hair.While Chester dresses like he's a member of the chess club(no offense to Chester).Linkin Park has more of an industrial-NineInchNails type sound.Linkin Park is also more fast and energetic with a kinda hip-hop vibe.Now we dont see a turntable in Evanescence do we?No.Well I do have to point out some similarities.Both singers are able to reach high and loud notes.Both very talented.The lyrics are also very similar as well.Both talk about childhood angst,haunting pasts and everyday pain and stress(maybe rape?).Both bands also often have strings and/or orchestras on their songs.Which would give the bands more of a wide,worldly sound.Personally,I dont think these bands sound alike.But every band is always gonna be compared to another.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Here's a bit of heresy: this one was the best of the lot.<br /><br />Some reasons, in brief:<br /><br />1) Minimal requirement for AS to open his mouth; but nice action and makeup.<br /><br />2) The story was well told, despite AS's presence, with all the right notes in the right places.<br /><br />3) The 'female' terminator was great, and more menacing than its predecessor - _because_ she was so dishy.<br /><br />4) Nice mix between the serious and dark, and stuff to grin about. (Could have done without some AS one-liners and the stupid shade-gags.)<br /><br />5) Neat avoidance of gratuitous gore without loss of story-telling effect.<br /><br />6) The development of Kate Brewster from a bewildered - already quite 'competent', but still fairly socially conformist - female into what's going to be a very kick-ass lady was nicely indicated.<br /><br />7) Great end! It promises another movie: the one telling the story about the ultimate victory.<br /><br />8) No resurrection of Linda Hamilton, and<br /><br />9) the absence of the wide-eyed-teenage-boy-wow-! element.<br /><br />10) No unnecessarily 'noble' characters. Just people who do what turn out to be very stupid things for reasons which are perfectly valid to them. (This is known as 'life' and thus believable.)<br /><br />11) The transition for the stereotypical notion of the 'mainframe'/hardware-based Skynet to the 'distributed', software-based kind (a transition symbolizing that from the industrial revolution into the information age) was a touch of genius, and provided a neat rationale for the theme of this movie.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />If AS becomes governor and canna do T4, it doesn't matter. Actually I hope he won't be able to do it. Stahl and Danes are quite suited to the job. It'll be a different story, but so what? It may be a _better_ story, and, for that matter, it might actually give the whole series a proper closure.<br /><br />I just hope they make the T4 story consistent. It won't be easy to convince me how a few straggly humans defeat a huge army of machines, all of whom operate without a centralized 'command'.

B0000C1733|5.0|This didn't start with \\"Aeroplane\\" (in fact it didn't include it at all) and it didn't end with \\"Road Trippin\\", but it introduced to us two great new songs (Fortune Faded my favorite of the two) and it included their best songs \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Californication\\", \\"Otherside\\", and \\"Under the Bridge\\".  \\"Give it Away\\" is an excellent song, and I was sad to se \\"The Zephyr Song\\" wasn't here, but if this RHCP compilation truly had all the greatest hits, this would have many more than just 5 stars.  This is an excellent disc for anyone who likes RHCP.  Whether you've got all the CDs, or if you were like me and just liked what you heard on the radio.  This CD will give you a great taste of RHCP and you'll want to buy their other albums to hear everything else they have!  RHCP is now my favorite rock band.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This beautiful movie is criticised for being bloody, but The Blood Of Christ cannot be understood today the way it was 800 years ago.  <br /> <br />Few people (even among Christians) can understand this movie.  Its Truth is borne out by the degree to which it is hated - like Christ was.   <br /> <br />It is a medieval view of Jesus' Passion that Mel Gibson gives us.  Gibson, a product of the Medieval Tridentine Mass, is the only man who could do it. <br /> <br />As Rev. Carter Heyward, Professor of Theology, Episcopal Divinity School said, \\"[The] movie illuminates a medieval, not biblical, interpretation that it is the blood of Christ that saves humankind. Not Jesus' life, not his healings or his wisdom, not his teaching or his compassion, not his passion for justice, but rather his death on the cross is what saves humankind; and moreover, his death on the cross as willed by his Father God, who requires him to suffer this excruciating death as payment for the sins of the world.\\" <br /> <br />As a Protestant steeped all-too-often in the divinity of Christ - I loved the Catholic focus on the humanity of Christ - his blood, sweat, and tears.  I loved the depiction of Pilate.  Mary was wonderful. Satan was amazing.  I could never have imagined such a Satan - and now I cannot get its image out of my mind <br /> <br />Mel Gibson is a genius.  This movie is a miracle.  See it; because such a movie will never happen again in our lifetime. <br /> <br />
0312335164|4.0|I like Dan Brown's thrillers because they're fast moving and have interesting plots with surprising twists and with puzzles that have to be solved. Also, the main protagonists are intelligent and educated people, and the stories, at least in part, take place in an environment where educated people interact. <br /> <br />Another attraction with Dan Brown's books is that the stories delve into fields of learning that are interesting. In \\"Digital Fortress\\" it's cryptography and computing, in \\"Deception Point\\" it's politics and the physics of materials, and in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" it's the history (and present state) of the Roman Catholic Church. <br /> <br />\\"Digital Fortress\\" really appealed to me because of the interesting twists in the plot. It's not too difficult to guess who the bad guy is, but he and the other characters all spend most of the book working against each other under false pretenses! A pretty neat trick! <br /> <br />But even though I liked \\"Digital Fortress\\" a lot I'm withholding the fifth star. There are several reasons... <br /> <br />Firstly, the bad guy died rather prematurely in chapter 105. The story then continues for an additional 23 chapters to a climax, but a climax where the good guys are locked in combat with a computer virus inexorably counting down to doing some digital nastiness. This just isn't as captivating as a man-vs.-man climax. <br /> <br />Secondly, I was turned off by Dan Brown's introduction of the main protagonist, Susan Fletcher: <br />\\"Susan stared in amazement.\\" (pg 44) <br />\\"Susan's jaw dropped.\\" <br />\\"Susan was flabbergasted.\\" (pg 45) <br />\\"Susan almost fell out of her chair. 'What?'\\" (pg 47) <br />\\"Susan gaped.\\" <br />\\"'What?' Susan collapsed back in her chair.\\" (pg 48) <br />Is this really how Dan Brown thinks a 38-year-old woman with an IQ of 170 and holding a top-level job at NSA (National Security Agency) acts? Good grief! <br /> <br />Thirdly, if you, like me, know a lot about computersthen you'll find it very annoying that Dan Brown got so many technology things wrong. There are simply tons of computer-related errors in the plot details.  <br /> <br />The most blatant mistake is the idea that an encryption program that only exists as a file encrypted by itself (the non-encrypted encryption program had been willfully erased!) could be retrieved if you knew the pass-key! This corresponds to having a safe and locking one of the two keys inside the safe and then destroying the second key - the safe can never be opened even though one key still exists! <br /> <br />Still, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is an exciting thriller and I became quite engrossed in it, despite the various problems I had with the plot and the characters. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion of the Christ leaves viewers speechless.  On one level, it is a brutal, bloody movie, but this is necessary.  A form of art must be graphic at times to reflect a larger truth.  Execution by flogging and crucifixion was a grisly form of death.  The Romans used it to torture and humiliate the accused.  Yet the underlying thesis, that Christ voluntarily died this death as a loving sacrifice for our sins, comes through.  This is an important, brilliantly made film.  You will be deeply moved by it.  Highly recommended.
B0000640SA|5.0|Definitely the type of movie that demands your full attention from start to finish.  The main character suffers a head injury that causes a bizarre condition that prevents him from forming new memories, although his memory prior to the injury is unaffected.  The movie combines fascinating psychological speculations with a gritty detective mystery.  Even though the story moves in reverse, from end to beginning, clever editing  makes it comprehensible.  In particular, I like the way key scenes are repeated at just the right moment, from slightly different perspectives and providing slightly more information.  As Guy Pearce gropes through his nightmare, it is really possible for you to feel what it's like to live without memories--and it's not a very pleasant feeling.  Lots of plot twists, a few loose ends, but enouch clarity to leave you satisfied at the end.  Or the beginning...
B00007BK2N|3.0|Don't let the cover fool you, its not that exciting of a movie. In fact, I don't recall ever seeing a tongue ring in the movie at all... and it really begins to drag at points...<br /><br />Still, its an educational flick and worth a watch just for the music. Its a docudrama on the legendary Tony Wilson, his idealistic lovechild Factory Records, his club and his career. Put together like an 80s punk video and with a soundtrack by bands like Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays who reigned in Manchester, England, it is an interesting look at the music scene of bands of the era. This movie is basically a VH1 special, but with more swearing. I enjoyed it, but its more of a niche piece than anything.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space is very funny and inventive.  I watched it Christmas after my sister bought it for me.  She said it would be right up my alley, because it looks cheesy.  It is!  That's what I like about it.  The klowns look really creepy.  The synopsis is like any aliens come to Earth movie.  They come and try to kill all humans, but with a clowny twist.  Popcorn guns, cotton candy cocoons, shadow puppet murders.  It was great.  I liked the creativeness.  It's movies like this that are great to watch with friends.  Of course this wasn't as funny as the Ring. (If anybody has read my reviews, then they would know my personal vendetta against that film.)  The Ring was full of clowns that almost killed me with laughter.  I would only buy this to put in my comedy section.  Killer Klowns offers some great twists on the run-of-the-mill sci-fi/horror film genre.  It is bound to entertain you.  Buy this film and be prepared for a great ride through the original Carnival of Carnage.
B0002234LS|5.0|Director David Koepp (A Stir Of Echoes) pulls together a Stephen King novella that manages to keep you guessing. Set in a nice rural Maine cabin on a lake, Mort Rainey (nice name played by Johnny Depp to perfection) suffers from writers block, a recent divorce (Maria Bello), and a conniving guy (Timothy Hutton) who is dating his ex-wife. Then there is a truly insidious Southern gentleman (John Turturro) who accuses him of stealing an old short story. As the depressed Mort tries to handle the aggressive nature of the Southerner (he wants `his' story changed) and his ex-wife's fianc&eacute;, strange things start to happen. Houses burn, manuscripts disappear, people are murdered, the Southerner starts baiting Rainey and, of course, someone murders Rainey's dog. Koepp manages to keep things from being too complicated and places one surprise after another in a sequence of scenes that moves at a steadily increasing clip. There are some genuinely suspenseful and tense moments; but the ending is typically Stephen King. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's the kind of ending that manages to be more disturbing than necessary. Plus, I just don't buy the fact that a cornfield can grow in a shady forest - but that is being picky.

B0000524CY|5.0|This in my opinion is the best horror film ever made. I don't know where some people come off when they say this was a thriller suspense. No, quite the contrary, it is a horror movie regardless of where you stand on this movie. The acting and character developments are not only great but very useful in this movie.  The story represents the ultimate battle  between good ( men of cloth ) and evil ( the devil ). It is this blatant use of the ultimate representation of evil, through an innocent girls body and mind , that makes us the viewers quite uneasy. This movie has dated quite well and one thing I love about this film is that is doesn't rely on heavy handed special effect or computer produced creations. For example the vomit wasn't computer generated but rather pea soup. When the bed floats it isn't trick photography, it is actually in the air held by suspension cables, I presume. It is this antiquated use of special effects, or lack thereof, that makes this movie even more scary because it adds quite well to the realism of this film. I believe the director had that in mind. The original film has poor hues in the film with some grain and colors that seem undistinct from one another.  The sharpness is at times dull but that isn't too much a distraction for the average viewer. Sound quality is decent.  Overall a great film .
B00005JN2X|1.0|I can't fathom why so many critics give this generic action movie such great reviews. It reminded me of that HBO show Taxi Cab confessions. The action scenes are generic as anything Stalone or Gov. Arnold did back in the eighties. The movie has a lot of stupid behavior on the part of Jamie Fox. Two cops pull him over and instead of jumping out and telling the cops Cruise has a gun and is forcing me to drive him around he lies to the cops. Stupid scene. I love Michael Mann's movie Heat but this one is a turkey. He should have gotten Deniro or Pacino to play the killer instead of Cruise. He cannot be taken serious as a contract killer. Whats next Hillary Duff as a street hooker? Lame movie.
B00005R24K|1.0|I was looking for something that would scare me and I had heard about this movie through various friends and discussions.  I thought it had to be good, especially considering that Sam Raimi did Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2.  Well, hell no, this movie is absolutely horrible.  The acting is laughable and the whole thing just seems like it is supposed to be a comedy, not a slasher.  Don't waste your time.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I'll be frank, I skipped this show because of Ashton Kutcher.  The thought being if he starred in it, it must be fluff.  But the reviews for the show were positive enough to draw me in and rent the dvd.   <br /> <br />SPOLIERS <br />Premise: Imagine a person who was not meant to be born was born.  As a result he has the ability to travel to back to any point in his life and make changes to it. The downside is that each time he does that, his actions can cause life altering situations.  Hence the Butteryfly effect (The wind from a butterfly's wing could cause a tornado somewhere else).   <br /> <br />I had problems with Ashton's character, being very rash and just a little stupid, but then again he was experiencing brain damage as a result of his actions.  I won't give the ending away but... this is not a exactly a feel good show. <br /> <br />I have to admit I liked the show. Its a good rental but probably not a keeper.  Acting was passable and plot was good. Despite an ending that many will balk at it was realistic and brave.

0446530891|3.0|I am not a Baldacci fan but I started this book and it got my interest - in fact it kept it until the very end when all was revealed - what a clunker!  None of it makes sense and is one of the stupidest, out there finales I have read in awhile.  I don't know why a good read had to end up so pathetially but it does.   The three stars are for about 280 pages and then it is downhill from there. What a waste of my time and I agree with another reviewer who called the killer a cartoon character -the killer was all that and  worse.  Save your money and time.
0375823360|1.0|Mr. Pullman, while gifted as a writer, seems to see himself as a prophet of atheism. Do I have a problem with this? No! Mr. Pullman can preach whatever he believes. Do I have a problem with this trilogy? Yes, and emphatically so. These books are NOT PRO-athiest. They are ANTI-Christian/Judaism/Muslim. They don't attack the idea of God, they attack these faiths specific views of God; a very important distinction.<br /><br />These books were written for children--and written in such a way as to try to guide children into agreeing with Pullmans beliefs. He does not come out and say what he thinks until the end of the trilogy, by which point the children have come to identify with his characters. Mr. Pullman is taking the only audience he can find that are impressionable enough to do damage to, and trying to influence their thinking. He compares himself to CS Lewis--an anti-CS lewis if you will--this is fine (if incorrect, as Lewis is promoting a belief, not attacking one). However, the subtle nature of his work and the fact that his books are not advertised as anti-Judeo/Christian is where the problem comes in. If he wants to write to influence people, he is welcome to do so (and even should do so if he has strong beliefs), however, he shouldn't try to sneak his ideas past the guiding influence of parents. Mr. Pullman is an ethical coward--one who will not try to sell his ideals to completely rational beings, for fear of rejection and low sales.<br /><br />To conclude, Mr. Pullman should either write books without his moral slant, or declare their moral slant early (on the cover!)so that parents can more easily understand what the book is about and what the author is trying to convince their children of.
0316666343|5.0|What mixed reviews!  My response, however, is not mixed.  I believe we will read this book for years and years.  I also believe it is a book that works wonderfully or not at all.  There is little middle ground. <br /> <br />For those who have not lost a beloved, the book's power may remain elusive and farfetched.  For those who have suffered serious loss, then the book's primal force remains inescapable.  Grief burns with reckless intent.  Life seems surreal, humorless, strident.  Behavior can be dysfunctional, erratic.  In this regard, Sebold gets it right, and she offers it with graceful restraint.  Less can be more, as we know from other works that tackle the big theme of life's meaning: Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, Hesse's SIDDHARTHA, and Camus's THE STRANGER. <br /> <br />Father, mother, sister, and brother -- they all stagger along, groping and grasping for understanding.  Their pain is amplified by not knowing -- not knowing what happened, not knowing if Susie's alive or dead, and not knowing the tenuous closure that a funeral provides.  In essence, they are consumed by \\"not knowing.\\" <br /> <br />Beyond this, Sebold takes a huge risk in having Susie tell the story from heaven.  We learn of a heaven that anyone could embrace (enough said).  We also learn that hell may be here, for those, the living, who try to make sense of the senseless, who try to embrace an affirmation of hope, and who try to find the courage to let go.  Of course, \\"trying\\" is the problem ... and what grace is all about. <br /> <br />Sebold has crafted an unflinching and ultimately life-affirming look at our most definitive pain, loss.  That is the transcendent beauty of this book.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When this first came out, I knew I had to go see it, but I didn't look forward to it at all.  I mostly wanted to make a statement to Hollywood by going to that movie, and I wanted to support what Mel Gibson did. <br /> <br />I am Protestant, and I know there was some controversy about whether or not Protestants should go.  I even got into a discussion about it via email with someone who didn't think we should.  Going only reenforced my belief that it transcends denominational boundaries.   <br /> <br />It is easy, especially with the picture portrails of the crucifixion, to get a prettied up picture of what happened in our minds.  Even if you've studied the physical effects of the crucifixion on the human enduring it (and I have), it is hard to see the crucifixion for what it truly was.  *The Passion* brings you face to face with that reality in a powerful way.   <br /> <br />I appreciated the flashbacks, especially those involving the things he said at the last supper.  Somehow, even those statements were more vivid in my mind once I saw the movie. <br /> <br />I came away from the movie with my faith reenergized.  I had been reminded of what God called me to do and enthusiastically wanted to do so; after all, it is the least I could do, given all He did for me.  I want to recreate that, especially when I feel my walk with God needs a \\"jump start.\\"  It was GREAT to see on the big screan, and if it is ever there again, I'd urge anyone and everyone to go.  But it is something that I thought was worth seeing more that once, in spite of my initial reticence to do so.  For that reason, I would also urge people to buy a copy for themselves. <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|This was my very first Tool album. I never listened to them before. And I received this as a gift even though I didn't listen to Tool. My music world revolved around mostly *ahem* nu metal bands... you know which I talk about. Heavy metal (okay, NU metal) was the only type of music I enjoyed because 90% of the music out there was just terrible. Meaningless pop music, rap metal was taking over, Korn were losing their magic, Hip-Hop/Rap was getting worse... music was at its lowest during the late '90s and 2000-2001 years... until Tool finally spoke to me.    Tool were NOT like the metal bands I listened to. The lyrics are so creative, full of wisdom, anger, hate, nihilism. It's pure poetry... and this is freaking heavy metal! Whodathunk metal could incorporate poetry into its world of madness? And the music... words cannot describe the awesomeness of what Tool has put onto this album.    Tool has shown me a completely different side of heavy metal. They've shown that heavy metal isn't just loud music with screeching guitar solos and a screaming vocalist. Tool has shown that metal can be art, so don't expect something like Slipknot's \\"Iowa\\" or Slayer's \\"God Hates Us All.\\" Expect something that Pink Floyd has done during their high point. And that's what I think of Tool. They're the Pink Floyd of the new generation and 21st century.    \\"Lateralus\\" doesn't have the anger of their previous albums, but it's good that they don't sound the same. It's softer but still has its hard metallic moments. \\"The Grudge\\" is a great opener. \\"The Patient\\" is probably the best song here. A softer song, spoken with creative poetry and wonderfully sung by Maynard. \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" is one of the two harder and fast-paced tracks here next to \\"Parabola.\\" The album title track (misspelled \\"Lateralis\\") has one of the greatest guitar intros ever. Nothing hard there... just softer and elegant up until the drums kick in. \\"Faaip de Oiad\\" is... an unusual track. It has something to do with Area 51.The drums beat in the background while some guy sounds scared. The album contains some fillers that remind me of what Pink Floyd has done.    \\"Lateralus\\" is certainly the best album of the 21st century so far. It's the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" for the next generation. And Tool are by far the best band out there now. Maynard is a great vocalist. Adam is one of the best, if not THE best, guitarists out there now. Justin is also a great bassist. And Danny is by far the best drummer out there now. Everything sounds so grand here, and to think, it only took four guys to do this.
1400034779|5.0|_The No. 1 Ladie's Detective Agency_ is technically speaking, a mystery, as the heroine is a private detective and through the course of the book does solve a number of cases.  However, the book is so much more.<br /><br />Smith has managed to not only describe Africa, but to capture its essence - the rythms of daily life, the culture, and nuances of the savannah.  Precious Ramotswe, the main character is charming, witty and resourceful, but also serves as an archetype for Africa - a woman who is gradually becoming successful and independent after a troubled past.  Highly recommended.
B000003TAR|5.0|The first time I've heard the whole album was when I found a copy laying around last summer. Hearing \\"In Utero\\" would have an impact on me, begin my road to becoming a Nirvana fan, and expanding my musical tastes.    With \\"In Utero,\\" Kurt wanted to do two things with this album. First, he wanted to shun away from the success that \\"Nevermind\\" had brought upon the band (kinda like what Pearl Jam did after \\"Ten\\"). Kurt wanted the band to go back to their so called \\"indie roots\\" and so Steve Albini was hired. With him onboard, the second thing Kurt wanted done was to make this album Nirvana's own \\"Surfer Rosa\\" album (an album by the Pixies which was also produced by Albini). Listen to both albums and see how the sound is similar to each other...    Now that \\"teenage angst has paid off well\\" for Kurt, now it was time for him to express his true self. He expresses pain, love, anger, sorrowful, and much more emotions. This is the album where Kurt seems more hateful towards everything, especially himself. A lot of fans would see this as a suicide note along with the band's Unplugged performance.    A haunting and disturbing album... there are very few albums that are like this. True emotions are revealed and you can hear it in Kurt's voice. Sick and gut-wrenching lyrics only add to that. The buzzing, sludgey, and distorted guitar brings it all out, and this time, Kurt plays more often (unlike strumming a few chords or picking a string or two on the \\"Nevermind\\" album). Krist isn't a brilliant bassist, but his simplicity is still unique to me. And Dave never sounded better. His drumming is at his best on this album.    In my opinion, this is Nirvana's best album, next to \\"Unplugged in New York.\\" It's full of brilliant tracks like \\"Serve the Servants,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" \\"Rape Me,\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" and \\"All Apologies.\\" Those are tracks that are more well-known to the casual listener, and are also the highlights that gives off Kurt's emotions the best.     \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" is my second all-time favorite Nirvana track. The guitar sounds range from high shrieking to buzzing and distorted. The lyrics are funny as well (find the lyrics since I bet that few of you know what he's actually saying under the noise) and the sounds of the Pixies' \\"Surfer Rosa\\" album bloom on this track. It's a weird track... I guess that's why I like it.    If you listen to the tracks that are not widely considered as Nirvana favorites, I assure you they are essential gems. You discover more when you listen to such like \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle,\\" \\"Tourette's,\\" etc., etc. Just because they're not on the radio 24/7 doesn't mean they suck.

The story begins with Christopher finding his neighbor's dog, and deciding to \\"play detective\\" and investigate this death.  It is more than it seems at first-through his journey to discover the answer to this problem he discovers bigger problems-problems that personally affect him and his life, problems which make him have different views on life.  Through this story-written by Mark Haddon who has, as a young man, worked with autistic individuals-we see the difficulties of all things in life through the eyes of this boy, and we learn much from this.<br /><br />However, as I did very much enjoy this book, it still has it's problems.  The main character, Christopher, is actually not that likable-of course, he is autistic, thus diiferent in ways-in that he can only see as far as what he wants and not the feelings or needs of others.  When he doesn't get exactly his way he has tantrums.<br /><br />Another fine oint about this book is that it is written as if written by Christopher, who can not tell lies, so all sentences are short and too the point... perfectly styled.  I highly suggest this masterpiece.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|Clint Eastwood's 1992 somewhat apologetic western on crime and justice in the Old West.  Although well acted with good direction, the film lags in its rather predictable plot and suffers from uninspiring action scenes.    The film starts with the senseless mutilation of a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey.  Anxious to keep the peace, Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman) asks the perpetrator to compensate the victim with several horses.  Humiliated and permanently disfigured, the prostitute isn't happy with the offer and raises a bounty for the death of her attacker.  With news of the bounty, widowed Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) leaves his family behind to get some badly needed money. A retired gunslinger left with a delapidated farm and a bleak future for his two children, Bill Munny returns to his life of sin one last time.  He soon joins up with his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) who's also leaving his reformed life for one final reward.  On their way to Big Whiskey, Munny and Logan are joined by The Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), a young hothead who also needs the reward. When the characters arrive in Big Whiskey, they run into gunslingers such as English Bob (Richard Harris)and the impatience of Sheriff Little Bill.  Wanting to keep the peace at all costs, the sheriff will do whatever it takes to keep hired guns out of Big Whiskey.  An unexpected incident leads to a final confrontation between the main characters.    Eastwood attempts several things in this film with mixed success.  First, he attempts to break away from the reverse trends in westerns he himself helped form over 30 years before in Sergio Leone's action-packed films.  In those films, the West was depicted as a wasteland of shady characters who could be either villains or heroes depending on the reward: the theme was presented through symbolic action sequences as opposed to extended and unrealistic dialogues using action as only the filler scenes.  In this film, Eastwood sacrifices action for more character study found in some of the older westerns preceding Leone's: the main difference being that characters' motivations are treated with much more realism than those presented in such earlier films. In this film, Eastwood shows that all of the characters are flawed in various ways.  The bounty hunters don't really care if their cause is just as long as the reward is payed; they simply justify their motivations post factum.  The sheriff is a man with honest intentions and his actions, although perhaps varying between inadequate and extreme, are solely in the interests of the community.  All of the characters are victims of their environment who must cope with the realities they are presented with.  Even the actual victim in the film, the prostitute, is depicted as a person who suffered from the consequences of her own immoral profession as opposed to the actions of a deranged criminal.    Although this is a good film, I found it to be overrated and  actually less creative than Clint Eastwood's other great western, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  I felt that the latter actually had more character insight and thematic depth than this film even though it didn't have as many stars.  In his attempt to be more sober in portraying the real West, Clint Eastwood seemed to fall in the same trap as earlier westerns by drowning the plot in over-the-top character/psychological studies of people who, realistically, weren't the types to intellectualize things too much. Although I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, this is one which I haven't bothered to buy for the reasons cited: I think it tends to make a better rental.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Magnolia\\" is a beautiful, breathtaking collage of a film, a rare three hour movie that doesn't seem it's length. Like Anderson's previous movie, \\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Magnolia\\" follows the lives of eight closely intertwined characters without missing a beat. Every scene matters, and the haunting music of Aimee Mann, whose \\"Save Me\\" was nominated for an Oscar, drives the film and gives it a unique grace.<br /><br />\\"Magnolia\\" takes place on one eventful day in the lives of eight men and women living in California. There are several themes that run through all of the stories, namely the search for real love, the death of fathers, misunderstood children, and the need for forgiveness. A dying man (Jason Robards) is looked after by an angelic nurse played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, while his younger wife (Julianne Moore) is guilt-ridden about her infidelity, and his estranged son (Tom Cruise) has become a popular sex self-help personality.<br /><br />Meanwhile, TV game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) has terminal cancer, and is trying to reach out to his drug addict daughter Claudia, played by Melora Walters. Claudia also begins a tenative relationship with a well-meaning but bumbling cop (John C. Reilly). William H. Macy plays Donnie Smith, a lonely former child game show champion whose life has never gone anywhere, and Jeremy Blackman plays a young contestant on the same show who is ignored by his father.<br /><br />These characters and their stories all interconnect in surprising and moving ways, and \\"Magnolia\\" emerges as a study in human connection. The performances are outstanding all around, with special credit going to Tom Cruise as the ferocious Frank Mackie, and Julianne Moore, whose Linda spends much of the film on the verge of a complete breakdown. John C. Reilly also impresses in a role that is a nice change from the clueless husband he played in \\"The Good Girl\\" and \\"The Hours.\\" Also noteworthy is the fantastic performance of Jason Robards, who conveys completely the slow, painful indignity of death.<br /><br />\\"Magnolia\\" is a movie that may try your patience, and its last half hour has to be seen to be believed, but the acting and Paul Thomas Anderson's expert direction make it well worth your time.of Jason Robards, who conveys completely the slow, painful indignity of death. <br /> <br />\\"Magnolia\\" is a movie that may try your patience, and its last half hour has to be seen to be believed, but the acting and Paul Thomas Anderson's expert direction make it well worth your time.
B00005MEW1|2.0|I love the movie, but the music does not live up to gothic industrial. It was very quiet and repetitive. A few times it started to build, but then nothing. <br /> <br />My wife and I are so frustrated by this DVD soundtrack that we are going to make our own REAL gothic industrila soundtrack using tracks from Type O negative, Ministry, BauHaus, NIN, even King Diamond and Danzig! <br /> <br />Don't waste your money. Buy the cheap Nosferatu with the old soundtrack.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|What can you say? A wonderful retrospective of the great MGM musicals.  Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and many other hosts talk about their lives at MGM in the golden age of Musicals.  I have been waiting years for this one to come out.  Also included are volumes 2 and 3, but the original \\"That's Entertainment\\" is worth the price of admission.  On a scale of 1-5 this definatly rates a 6.

B00024BHTC|4.0|It is funny to read all the 1 star reviews for this album... as I do think it is the same person (probably a teenager) writing over and over.  Anyway, I am in my mid-thirties and I can honestly say that this is quality melodic, operatic metal.  If you liked previous nightwish releases, I guarantee you will like this one.  I think it is slightly better than Century Child, but not as good as my favourite, Wishmaster.  So, please, if you do not like this style of music, don't bother writing negative 1 star reviews for it, what's the point!?
6304711905|4.0|George P. Cosmatos' rather overrated 1993 western covering the events and characters of the famous shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, between the Earps and the Clantons.  Although brought to life by a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and modest acting by everyone else, the film suffers from an uneven screenplay that tries to incorporate too much of a sstory in light of its narrow subject.    As the title indicates, the entire film is primarily about what led to the shootout at the OK Corral instead of being about the life of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel.)  Unfortunately, it seems that the film can't make up its mind as to whether it wants to deal more with its characters or its setting.  As such, we have a Wyatt Earp who should be worrying about the Clantons but is more cocerned with explaining issues that have little relevance to the main plot (e.g. a rather shallow love story that just takes time away from the film dealing with the Clantons or other important characters.)  Other nuances just add to the irritation; the most absurd part being a cattle-rustling and illiterate cowboy engaging in a Latin wit contest with Doc Holiday (please, the Clantons were low-life cattle russtlers who could barely even read English.)  The story tends to stumble upon itself in this fashion leading to a rather hurried ending that is anti-climactic.    In sum, it's a rather overrated film that became popular mainly, if not exclusively, because of Val Kilmer's excellent performance as Doc Holliday.  Apart from that, the screenplay is uneven in its treatment of the characters and in terms of plot continuity. A good film to own or rent but it certainly isn't one of the best westerns to have been made.  For a better study of Wyatt Earp as a character and his life, watch 'Wyatt Earp' with Kevin Costner instead.
B0000524CY|5.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" has justifiably been called one of the scariest movies ever made, and it is a testament to its enduring power that a rerelease twenty-five years later conjured up a new wave of admiration for this shocking film.<br /><br />The film concerns a 12 year old girl named Regan (Linda Blair), who is the daughter of film actress Chris MacNeil, played by Ellen Burstyn. Slowly, Regan is taken over by a demon, and her mother turns to the Catholic church for help. Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest who is haunted by his mother's death and rapidly losing his faith in God. He concludes that Regan is the victim of demonic possession, and the elderly Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) is called in to perform an exorcism.<br /><br />This film is directed perfectly by William Friedken from an Oscar-winning screenplay by William Peter Blatty. Friedkin makes the movie visually haunting, and creates many scenes of exceptional power that still have the power to disturb. The performances in this movie are some of the most intense that I have ever seen. Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, and Jason Miller in particular are pushed to their limits in \\"The Exorcist,\\" and the trio all received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their labor. Max von Sydow is also memorable as Father Merrin, as is Jack MacGowran as Burke Dennings, a drunken movie director, and Lee J. Cobb as the eccentric Lieutenant Kinderman, who investigates Denning's mysterious death. However, the unsung hero of this movie is the late Mercedes McCambridge, who provides the terrifying voice of the demon inside Regan.<br /><br />\\"The Version You've Never Seen\\" includes several scenes that were excised from the original print of \\"The Exorcist,\\" and for the most part they only add to a film that was nearly perfect to begin with. The only qualm I have is that the use of additional \\"subliminal\\" images gets to be a bit excessive. On the whole, though, I highly recommend \\"The Exorcist.\\" It deserves its high reputation.
B000000OTU|4.0|This cd rocks. Every song on this is good! I have 4 Aerosmith cds and this is my favorite one. if you are looking for the toys in the attic era then try Classics Live 1 and 2, but if you are looking for greatest 80s Aerosmith, then this is for you! I never quite understood why the title songs for both Permanent Vacation and Get a Grip were never hits, they are both great songs. The only problem I have with this is that they should have put cheese cake, remember walking in the sand, and chiquita on this. I mean, they are 1979, not 80, but there is hardly a difference. Also, NOTHING from done with mirrors, which is 80s too. Overall, this is a pretty good cd.
B000078DOH|5.0|This absolute gem of an album, released in 1985, and produced by the godfather of funk himself - George Clinton, is a masterpiece in the Peppers' discography. George Clinton could not have been a better individual to work with at the time. The Peppers' high energy and Clinton's funk vision is definitely a magical combo of music. You got to hand it to a band such as the Chili Peppers, who have tackled several genres and styles of music; and still keep it fresh; now matter what direction their music goes in next.
B0002I831S|4.0|I have read all of the reviews ( or should that be PREVIEWS  since the set hasn't even been released yet? ), and have experienced alternating pleasure and dismay over what many people have said about the series and Paramount.    First, I too did not buy all of the original DVD releases... not so much because of the price ( I didn't find the $20.00 per DVD THAT distressing, considering I paid about that much per EPISODE when they were first released on VHS ). What I found more objectionable was the enhanced 5.1 audio mix.     While I admire the time and effort it took to produce these new mixes, I did not really like the liberties taken with the soundtracks, such as added sound effects, and background music re-tracked with different cues. The example that really appalled me was the changing of music in the episode \\"The Menagerie\\", which was tracked with music from second season episodes in some places. I would not have felt so strongly against this practice had Paramount seen fit to include the original monophonic mixes as alternate tracks. This practice is common with many motion pictures released by other studios ( 20th Century Fox is a good example... check out the five additional soundtrack mixes on their first DVD release of the 1979 film \\"Alien\\" on of which was purely music! ), but I guess Paramount doesn't feel it's worth the cost involved.     Then I started noticing other imperfections, like the fact that a very small piece of footage containing a line or two of dialogue was missing from the third season episode \\"The Tholian Web\\" ( for obsessives like myself, the missing footage comes as Dr. McCoy releases Uhura from sickbay ). It's a small thing, but, by golly, these DVDs were supposed to be the ultimate in picture and sound quality... how could they make goofs like that?      So why am I buying this release now? Because I've become spoiled by the superior picture quality of the DVDs I do have, and find it difficult to watch the VHS versions anymore. Yes, like others here I find the prices that Paramount charges a bit steep, but it is their property, and they are free to charge what they feel the market will bear. A lot of people seem to forget that it was Paramount who started the trend of lower VHS prices when they first released \\"Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan\\" at the (then ) ground-breakingly low price of $39.95, back when the average cost of a new movie on home video was $79.95.      And to those who are complaining about buying the same episodes again, imagine my dismay after having bought all the individual sets of an old sci-fi series released on DVD by A&E, only to have them re-release the entire series as one set, INCLUDING an exclusive \\"Bonus Disc\\" ( only available with the box set ) with three corrected prints of episodes that were less than perfectly mastered the first go around, and a short film, highly desired and prized by fans of that series, at no particular savings in price over buying the individual sets!  So, after that stinging experience I'm not going to complain too much about the fact that Paramount has at least created an entirely new presentation of the episodes. I can only hope that they will correct some of the errors of the previous releases ( although I will not be surprised if they don't ).
B000002H4Q|4.0|I think this album is an interesting retrospective of what The CUre can actually do. It opens with the dark and drowning out song The Kiss..Which by far is one of the best CUre songs. The long scrreching guitar solo's and revamps just make you stay for the 4 min. intorduction...then finally Robert SMith wails with Oh, kiss me kiss me kiss me...yeah toungue like poison so slow and it builds up my mouth.... The next song catch is not that good, but has a catchy snare drum riff. Tourture is oddly like the basis of Japanese Whispers and it is one of the unknown highlights. Also some other highlights are Why Cant I be you? Which is probally the most catchiest song ever. Just like heaven, and Hot Hot Hot! Are great favorites to me. Hot Hot Hot....I know was a hit in the U.K. but why it was not in the us blows my mind...it is a great song. How beautiful you are? retrospects on more of a slower/fast tempo beat about love and melonchaly. The last couple of songs fall flat which is why I gave it a four, but toher than those it is an awesome album and one of themore underatted ones.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|\\"Big Fish\\" flows like a still stream in the beginning, and with the gradual intensity of the story development, the emotional ending was truly moving and impressive.      Will, the son of the self-boasting Ed Bloom, was annoyed by his father's tall stories and found the speech his father gave at his wedding intolerably humiliating. Ed Bloom had loved telling tales impossible to take place to everyone, who fancied him for his humor and creativity. However, Will was sick of his father's unrealistic storytelling and blamed him for his absence from a large portion of his childhood. They were at odds after Will's wedding and had not conversed for several years. As Ed Bloom was approaching death, Will initiated a series of exploration of the \\"truth\\" to his father's exotic journeys and finally mended the feud with Ed before he passed away.     Will re-experienced the symbolical treasures hiding beyond his father's adventures and finally came to realize what kind of person Ed was. When Ed was dying, Will told a story of the way Ed went to heaven that Ed saw in the witch's eye, in which he became a big fish as he always dreamed of, to soothe his fear of biting the dust. Most audience claimed that they were close to tears when they watch this part since the emotional outburst is unforgettable.     Ed's magical journeys take up the most part of the movie, and if not exciting, the scenes are truly picturesque and the depiction is sparklingly humane. In the beginning, Ed was a boy with conspicuous potential constrained in a small town. After having made some unbelievable achievements (such as visiting a witch, winning the prize at a football match, etc.), he decided to leave the town with a giant to broaden his horizon. His stories covered nearly every aspect of human life, and with his adventurous attitude he had prove himself to be extraordinary. Sometimes those stories drag on rather too long, yet there are some brilliant points of view from Ed. Words like \\"When one sees thelove of his life, the time really stops as everyone says. But nobody has told you that they will go by twice as quickly when you want to catch up\\" is classic.     \\"Big Fish\\" is thought provoking and there are many parts open to various interpretations. For my part, it assures me that it is not necessarily negative to engage myself in a fantasized world and I should not look at one thing only on its surface. No matter what, we will feel better living in a world polished with beauty and brightness.
B000009RC2|5.0|I am going to go ahead and give this one 4.5 stars. The only reason I take off .5 from this amazing fusion masterpiece, is because at times it feels like everyone in the band is just playing as fast as they possibly can. Jazz shredding it would seem, and it's not totally impressive. I personally prefer melody to speed, but nonetheless Mahavishnu Orchestra continues to blow my mind every time I listen to them. Truly this album is fusion gold and sets the bar for any fusion artists to this day.

0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress is a computer program that will change the encryption standard for the world, creating new privacy where there was only pseudo-privacy before.  Does this sound boring?  On the contrary, it could not be LESS boring! <br /> <br />This is the second novel I have picked up by Dan Brown.  The first was Angels & Demons, which I highly recommend.  In comparison, Angels & Demons had a more satisfying ending and was packed with more suspense.  However, the characters in Digital Fortress were more interesting, in my opinion, and once again, I have learned a lot of little bizarre truths from this book. <br /> <br />Once you've read Digital Fortress, check out Dan Brown's website.  He has some maps of the National Security Agency (had you heard of it?), bizarre true facts from the novel, and other tidbits.  A thriller based in truth is always the scariest to me, and the fact that there are no clear-cut answers in the end will make you ponder privacy issues. <br /> <br />In addition, you will find yourself trying to break the unbreakable code(s) throughout the book.  And then when you get to the last page...watch out.  I still haven't figured it out. <br /> <br />This is a great novel, filled with intrigue, suspense, and revelation.  I recommend it...without wax.
B000002KO3|5.0|If any of you out their enjoy the sounds of electronica or simply use a looping device, you owe it to The Talking Heads to go out and buy this album. A revolutionary album for the time, producing some of the most lasting electronic classics of all time. Songs like the opener Born Under Punches, Crosseyed and Painless, and the hit Once In A Lifetime, the song about the way people let time slip through their fingers, and wake up one morning wondering where their life went and basically asking \\"How did I get here.\\" The instrumentals on the album are richy and funky, mixed well with David Byrne's seemingly non sequitor, out there lyrics. Clearly a masterpiece from The Talking Heads, and a must own for anybody, anywhere, at any time in your life. An album that never gets old...and gets better with age, now an achievement like that is a true masterpiece.

If MM we're alive and his medium available in 1775, I'm sure he would have been able to crank out a movie that depicted George Washington as a British sympathisor and one unfit to lead a latrine duty let alone all forces (George's greatest ambition at one point in his life was to be an officer in His Majesty's army you know.

B00002Z88D|5.0|As a huge metal fan as well as a violist in my school string orchestra, I can only applaud the Metallica and San Francisco Symphony on this monumental album. Though it is a live album and you can hear the audience singing some lines, the quality is that of a studio album. Over all, I enjoy these songs live even more than the album versions, which I can't say about every band. <br /> <br />The arrangers of this album had the good sense not to overshadow any part of Metallica's original songs and thus didn't cancel out any of Metallica's heaviness. The instruments in the orchestra only added to everything that the band does. If there ever was a bar on metal/symphony albums, this not only completely shattered it but set it so high that I doubt that any band will beat this for a long time. And as for any metal \\"purist\\" who says that this album is selling out, you probably haven't listened to how amazing it is.

My only gripe about this album is Exit Music (for a film), I really don't like that song at all, but it's not enough of a problem for me to give this album less then the 5 stars that it truly deserves. This is a must have album, I repeat: THIS IS A MUST HAVE ALBUM!

038551123X|1.0|From the first clatteringly awful paragraph, through the remainder of the incredibly poorly written first chapter, a potentially interesting and frightening story is transformed into annoying drivel through which I could not skim quickly enough.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|A lot of people have said this is a video game made into a movie, but actually it's not, it's just a video game that you watch.  In a game, you solve puzzles and shoot things.  When you make that into a movie, there's a gigantic, gaping hole in it where the main character should be.  Lara Croft has no personality.  She's emotionally distant, humorless, cold and unknowable.  As someone else said, she's \\"uber-cool\\", to the point of not really being human anymore.  She seems to be able to relate more to gadgets and machines than people.  When she's fighting a robot, riding a motorcycle, or trying to figure out the secrets of an ancient clock, she has a sparkle in her eye.  Her character really comes to life.  Yet as soon as she has nothing to do but relate to her fellow humans, all hope is lost.  She totally shuts down and just sits there, or stands there, bored out of her mind. This is the reason parents don't like their children to sit and play video games all day long, and insist they go out and play with their friends.  You might wind up being able to relate only to gadgets and having no use for people as well.    But don't get me wrong, I liked the movie.  I thought the special effects were really cool (...).  But just imagine how good a film it would have been if the (...) had a personality as well?  I mean, wow, you could have had something on the level of the Indiana Jones movies then.    It's really the fault of the writer, for not giving her any personality, and of Jolie for not trying to add anything to the empty material, and of course of the director, for seeming to think this was all just fine.
0385335482|5.0|Ok, this was a spur of the moment purchase in an airport bookstore and to be honest, the first several chapters were hard to get through. . .  But it was a long flight and I had nothing better to do, so I kept reading, and I am so glad I did!  I guess the first book in any series is a little slower than the rest since the author has to take the time to really develop the characters - and the character of Becky Bloomwood simply cannot be developed in the first twenty pages.<br /><br />I'll admit that in the beginning, I was a little bored and the heroine of the story really annoyed me, but at some point along the way - and I can't really pinpoint when - I was hooked.  The slow start is worth it, and the next two books in the series are even more hysterical than this one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - in fact, I recommend the entire series - and trust me, don't give up on the story too soon.  Keep reading, because it really is worth it!  All of a sudden you'll go from being simply amused to laughing out loud - and when you've turned the last page, you'll find yourself reaching for Book #2!
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"The Passion\\" is not a movie to \\"enjoy\\" it is a movie that is based on truth, Jesus IS a Jew, he is not dead, the jews did not kill him, WE all did. This movie is one that takes one out of the comfort of pretty Jesus, to the reality of what he went through for ALL of us. The love that is beyond measure, \\"The Passion\\" This movie showed in very clear detail the evil of mankind, things really haven't changed much. Be prepared to be uncomfortable, if your heart isn't broken by the love God has for us...... pray for a new heart
1402581386|5.0|Three cheers for author Jeff Lindsay, who delivers an innovative narrator for this page-turner mystery:  a serial murderer.  Sociopath Dexter Morgan, a technician in the Miami police department, doesn't possess a conscience or feelings but has the character to fell evil murderers. One must suspend disbelief but that's part of the fun!  Let's hope author Lindsay is hard at work giving Dexter more crimes to solve.
0316096199|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this book when I started but I'm glad I did. I finished it in less than 24 hours. It was riveting. The story of her rape can be brutal and gritty at times. You get a peek into Sebold's head and sometimes, what you see is not pretty. But she shows courage and bravery in pursuing the man who raped her and seeing the judicial process all the way through conviction. I was cheering for Sebold at the end!!

B000009EUM|5.0|I'm a huge classic rock fan but always loved this album!  It is a lot more sophisticated than the Hunting High & Low album, and a lot darker which is probably why it didn't catch on in the US.     The way the music flows UPWARD on a sad song like \\"Soft Rains of April\\" is genius...this a similar effect the Beatles used on \\"She's Leaving Home\\".     The title song is very visual...like it could be the soundtrack to a short film.  And the structure of \\"The Swing Of Things\\" begins to get more more complex than that of the usual pop song (you can hear A-ha getting out of the vein of Verse/Chorus/Verse/Chorus/Instrumental/Chorus).    There are also just some catchy pop tunes like \\"Cry Wolf\\", and the really bad \\"Maybe Maybe\\" which sounds like it was just a throwaway fun song (though possibly good as somewhat comic relief for this otherwise dark album).  Aside from \\"Maybe, Maybe\\" I can listen to this whole album.
B0001QNFXW|5.0|I saw this concert on Bravo a couple of weeks ago. It blew my mind. I didn't even know I was a Jamiroquai fan but they had me dancing around my living room early in the morning. I can't wait to have my own copy. Can't believe it took me this long to discover a truly amazing band.
B00005JMUA|4.0|If you thought the first one was a little played out and fake, and overall just plain weird....This movie seems to end the disappointment. I was very eager to see what happened next in every scene, it just kept me entertained. The fight with Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah was completely amazing and entertaining. You have to see this movie, even if you didn't like the first, you have to see the second still.

It may have a weaker story  line then most dinsey films but it's charming and cute and a good fantasy escape tale like Disney films are.  The kittens are adorable <br />it's well worth watching not may dvd extras but still worth seeing just for the film..
B00007KWHN|4.0|This is the best studio yes album out there I think. It is all classic Yes material. My favorite songs on it are Perpetual Change, and Your's is no Disgrace, but The rest of the songs are also very good too. Ive seen all good people is a big radio hit and Starship trooper and clap are frequently played at Yes concerts. The reason why I am giving this review 4 stars instead of five is because although Tony Kaye's organ sounds good on Yes's first album and Time and A Word, it just does not fit the proggressive rock sound. Instead of getting this album I would get Yessongs since it has most of the songs from The Yes album but has Rick Wakemen on Keyboards instead of Tony Kaye.
037571457X|5.0|'Persepolis' is an astonishing retelling of the author's youth during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Gross horrors occur including bombings, murders, arrests and riots but what is so extraordinary about Marjane Satrapi's story is how otherwise it is so ordinary. She experiments with cigarettes, listens to punk music and hangs posters on her walls -- all the trimmings of an American adolescent's life. This gives 'Persepolis' a universal appeal, an accessability that makes the differences all the more shocking. The stark reality that Satrapi and her family live in constant danger is effecting, and it will not leave you when you put the book down. The style Satrapi uses in her drawings clearly sets the tone of her story. There is a childish innocence to the illustrations perfectly suited to the worldview of our narrator, herself a child at the beginning. Her gradual awakening to the ways of the world has all of the truth and optimism that make 'To Kill a Mockingbird' the classic it is today. 'Persepolis' earns its place among stories like that and 'The Catcher in the Rye'. I would highly recommend it to anyone, and can't wait for the sequel.
B000003TA4|2.0|This album is very overrated. Kurt Cobain was druggie with no musical talent and it shows on Nevermind. Smells like Teen Spirit is a very boring song and is only entertaining the first few times you listin to it(same with the rest of the songs). I don't understand why Nirvana was and is, so popular. If you want some good grunge then you should listin to Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, or Screaming Trees.
B00008EY65|4.0|Oh No! Those evil nazis are back, attempting to gate in another slimy entity from the great beyond! It's up to HELLBOY (Ron Perlman) and his band of misfits (including Abe Sapien the fishman) to stop them. HELLBOY is a good solid wiz-bang of a movie! Lots of excitement, gunfire, explosions, and a fairly decent plot. There's even a love interest that actually works without making us wanna barf! I loved the Firestarter gal! As for the bad guys, I thought the self-mutilated nazi fella was totally creepy / cool! HELLBOY has potential as a series of movies, IF the stories are good. Perlman is a natural as the demonoid hero! Check it out...
B0001Z52RU|4.0|In this film the chaos theory is visited and an interesting dilemma is presented, if you could change the past would it be worth changing? <br /> <br />Ashton Kutcher and his childhood portrayers, John Patrick Amedori and Logan Lerman (excellent representations by the way!), go back and forth through time in an attempt to alter the past so that the present circumstances might be better. Kutcher as an adult is a psychology student who can access the past through his childhood journal entries. After several violent incidents that occur during his childhood along with his friends, specifically child abuse, animal torture and a bombing dare gone wrong, Kutcher believes he can change the outcome and save the lives of his cherished friends. In a film that twists and turns and keeps your mind wondering the characters walk back and forth over time making changes and living the outcomes only to continuously be disappointed, life is never perfect no matter how hard they try.  <br /> <br />Kutcher and his gang do excellent work in this thriller with a message. This movie is suspenseful, gut wrenching and something that will cause one to ponder the source of our own childhood guilt. It will leave you questioning how much you would sacrifice to save the life of your friends. With so much psychological interest on the past affecting ones future it is an interesting concept to theorize upon. By altering the past would it really make life any better or would we just flutter about looking for new butterfly wings to carry us forward into yet another unknown?  <br />
B0001NBMEE|4.0|Released in 1954, \\"Prince Valiant\\" is as much fun for the whole family now as it was fifty years ago. This colourful, Cinemascope movie is a feast for the eye, and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. You have a brave young hero to cheer for--a nasty villain to \\"hiss\\"--action--romance--beautiful sets, locations, costumes--and Henry Hathaway's expert direction.    A very young Robert Wagner stars as \\"Prince Valiant\\", a Viking who wishes to become a knight in the court of King Arthur--he certainly cuts a dashing figure, once you get used to a rather outlandish, but compulsory, Prince Valiant wig ! Valiant soon finds himself involved in a treacherous plan to oust his own father, King Aguar ( laid-back, avuncular Donald Crisp ), and--zounds !--King Arthur himself ( laid-back, avuncular Brian Aherne ). Of course, our hero still finds time to fall in love with Princess Aleta ( gorgeous Janet Leigh )--not enough romance ?--well, Aleta's handmaiden, Ilene ( sultry Debra Paget ) is \\"smitten\\" with Valiant's mentor, Sir Gawain ( a bluff and hearty Sterling Hayden ). Stirring up the whole pot is the ambitious, unscrupulous Sir Brack ( James Mason, stealing scenes with ease ). We have a very lively jousting scene, plenty of battles, narrow escapes and other feats of \\"derring do\\". There is, in fact, never a dull moment ! There are more than a few \\"camp\\" aspects to this movie, not the least of which are those strong American accents of Mr.Wagner and, especially, Mr.Hayden. Remember \\"The Black Shield of Falworth\\" when Tony Curtis, in heavy Bronx accent, says \\" take me to da castle of my fadda \\" ? There are a few smiles like that here.    The DVD is beautiful--you will be hard pressed to find many films more colourful than this lovely Cinemascope gem from Fox. Extras are sparse--a few trailers and a brief promotional clip from the fifties. Some comments from Robert Wagner would have been fun--fifty years later, and he still looks great--I wonder what he eats for breakfast ?!    While it may not be in the same class as \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", \\"Prince Valiant\\" remains a fine example of Hollywood swashbuckling hokum that will not wear out its welcome with repeated viewings. Recommended.
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier has written a beautiful novel of Dutch life in the 1600's blended with the art of the renowned painter Vermeer. <br /> <br />The story revolves around a young Dutch girl named Griet who is employed by a mistress and her husband (Vermeer) to work as a maid in their household. Griet comes from a poor family who struggles to survive after an accident takes the sight of her father and leaves him unable to provide for his family. As a young maid Griet tries to fit in with the large family and tangled webs they weave. She is fascinated by the art of Vermeer and becomes an unofficial assistant to the great man. But the story lies in the subtle nuances and splendid metaphors that Chevalier creates to guide her characters along. Through her beautiful writing you will fall in love with the period, the art and with young Griet. <br /> <br />I recommend having a Vermeer art book near by as you read so that you can reference the many paintings as Chevalier leads you through their creation. Along with the assistance of her character Griet we are able to imagine how Vermeer used moments in time, the camera obscura and objects placed just so to create his art. All of the fiction could easily be something that actually occurred because little is known of Vermeer's life behind the scenes. Chevalier manages to paint her own masterpiece with this lovely novel. Once you begin to see life through Griet's eyes you won't be able to put it down and love will seem so harsh in our own time period as compared to the subtle innocence of the 1600's when a touch on the lips or a look into a sparkling eye would produce shockwaves of emotion. Find out how a little pearl earring can produce so much elegance yet hold the most complicated of truths.     <br />

0553573403|5.0|It seems that nearly everybody who has read any of George R.R. Martin's wonderful series \\"A SONG OF FIRE AND ICE\\" has soundly praised the books as perhaps the best fantasy novels ever written, (the exception being \\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS\\" - the grand-daddy of all fantasy literature.)Now I feel compelled to throw in my two cent's worth.<br /><br />I picked up the first book in this series after spending what seemed like an eternity slogging through as much of the Robert Jordan series as I could stomach. Somewhere around the middle of book six or seven, I came to realize that the story was going nowhere and that I really didn't much care about the characters anymore. Having been burned out by that experience, I was reluctant to take up another epic series for fear of wasting my precious time.<br /><br />What a delight it was to start reading \\"A GAME OF THRONES\\"! The story moved along at a brisk pace, all the characters - both good and bad - were engaging, believable, complex, and thoroughly enjoyable. The chapters flew by in quick succession, each building up to a climax that left me wanting more.<br /><br />Here are a few reasons why I think Martin's books are so good:<br /><br />1. Strong Characterization: The story is told from the viewpoint of several characters, each with a unique perspective on the story being told. Each character has weaknesses that make them interesting, and strengths that make them worthy of your attention. I found myself enjoying - even liking - the bad guys as much as the good guys, and while the story centers around the Stark family, it's hard not to root for Tyrion Lannister and his exploits as well.<br /><br />2. No Esoteric Nonsense: Martin's novels are very complex, but he avoids the pitfall of creating a fantasy world so complex that he must spend chapter upon chapter explaining it all. He hands out the required information in \\"bite size chunks\\" that are easily digested. In this book, there is the hint of magic, but it resides in the shadows of this fascinating world. The main characters are decidedly non-magical, thus avoiding that whole \\"here's how the magic works in this world\\" claptrap that is frequently befuddling and largely ludicrous in many fantasy novels. Nobody here is shooting fire from their eyes or lightning bolts from their rear end.<br /><br />3. Plain Talking: The characters all speak plainly - I understand everything they're saying the first time! What a relief! I hate it when a character starts speaking in gibberish that we, the readers, have no chance of understanding. \\"Thou must taketh the flemmlehosk through the morphose of spunkletran and cast it down upon the churplesnord, being careful to avoideth the wonkledope.\\" Huh?<br /><br />4. No Useless Information: Martin doesn't fill up his chapters with side story lines that do not propel the plot. His story is complex, multi-faceted, and full of detail, but each page adds another important image to the rich tapestry he is weaving.<br /><br />5. Few Dream Sequences: Many fantasy authors will throw in those \\"dream sequences\\" that usually end up being irrelevant to the main story line. They are usually a space filling exercise in creative writing in which the author tries to wow us with their extraordinary powers of creating hallucinogenic imagery. Anytime I hit one of those chapters in a book, I moan and wonder if I really need go through the agony wading through the muck, or can I just skip ahead to when the character is awake again. Jordan elevated the dream device to a new level of irritating with the \\"Dream Walkers.\\" Only one character in Martin's books has any dream sequences; they are relevant and blessedly brief.<br /><br />A GAME OF THRONES is an excellent, excellent book that I recommend as a must read for any fans of the genre.

B00005JMAH|2.0|Okay the director is what really suffered in this movie and the box office reciepts showed it.  It moved too fast with little connection or explaination; characters personalities aren't built well;  <br />The worse thing you can do is read the book first and then watch the film; too late you say, oh well it is still enjoyable for those games of \\"Spot what they did wrong\\" and \\"Shots\\". <br />I suppose the writers should have gotten a lot of the blame too, but at least they read the book!...at least I would have hoped so.  JKR did such a good job at reining the writers in the first 2 movies, she should have kept a closer eye on them this round too.   <br />A great book that crashes and burns. <br />Let's all hope book 4 fares much better--although they will be cutting out the Dursleys entirely...that is just wrong on so many levels!

Checked out his website and sampled other songs from the album and I loved them all too.  I just saw him play live and he did not disappoint.  This is the kind of CD that you can listen to the whole way through, over and over again - it's definitely a must have CD.

B000089CJI|4.0|I listened to this CD on the recommendation of my cousin and I have to give him credit. I've been playing this over and over. This CD really reminds me of some of the great 80s synth music. If I had to pick two, I'd say this CD reminds of of Kraftwerk crossed with Lightning Seeds, but I sometimes hear a hint of Human League, too. Ultimately, I really like this CD and find it refreshing compared to most music made today. I haven't listened to Death Cab for Cutie yet, but my cousin gave me a copy of it, too. If I ever stop listening to this CD I'll check it out.
B0002I831S|5.0|This isn't really a review of the series, which of course gets 5 stars.  Rather, it's a response to all the whingers complaining about how they got ripped off on the original, two episodes per disc releases. <br /> <br />Tough for you!  But, as another reviewer said, nobody put a gun to your head, did they?  If you had more money that sense back then, that's your problem.   <br /> <br />Want to know why Paramount did that rip-off release in the first place?  Take a look in the mirror!  They knew that suckers like you would cough up over the odds, just as they knew they'd cash in again in the future with proper box sets.  Something else: if people like you hadn't bought those original releases in the first place then we probably would have had these box sets years ago.  So, you were not only fools to yourselves; you screwed it up for the rest of us too!  No sympathy (is that coming across, at all?) <br /> <br />Another comment, for those people who say that the episodes are in air date order instead of production order.  They're DVDs!  You can play 'em in whatever order you like!!!  Check out web fan sites, and you'll easily find the correct production order listed somewhere.  Try [...] for instance.  To be honest though, it doesn't make too much difference if you play them in air date order, except that Where No Man Has Gone Before should be your Episode One (at least, until The Cage finally makes an appearance, anyway).
0451529308|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|This album introduced the world to the guitar virtuoso known as Edward Van Halen, and rock and roll hasn't been the same since. <br /> <br />Van Halen starts off with the hard driving, thunderous \\"Running With The Devil.\\" A true fist-pumper if there ever was one.  Then, in a little over 1 and a half minutes, Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo \\"Eruption\\" ushers in a new era of hard rock. This track is the definitive Van Halen style of over-the-top greatness. <br /> <br />Other notable tracks include a cover of the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\" (buffed up of course), \\"Jamie's Cryin,\\" and \\"On Fire.\\" I highly recommend anyone who hasn't listened to this album to do so.

The insights into the servants and the upper-class relationships is startling for fans of \\"Masterpiece Theatre,\\" but the storyline is bogged down by the tepid murder mystery, and the film putters to an unsatisfying end.<br /><br />At an old British country house in the 1930s, guests are arriving through the rain for a shooting party. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) is an unscrupulous noveau riche aristocrat, and he presides over a household that contains many servants: butler, housekeeper, footmen, maids, and many more. Like good early-20th-century servants, they know their place in the strict hierarchy.<br /><br />But things come unravelled as the guests arrive: acid tongued Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her naive maid Mary (Kelly MacDonald), and her sisters and brothers-in-law. Adding a bit of American flavor is actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and producer Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). But then McCordle is poisoned and stabbed, and a thick, sticky web of old lies, seduction and malice is uncovered.<br /><br />If nothing else, \\"Gosford Park\\" is soothing to watch. We get a great view of the trappings of the 1930s British upper-crust. Altman also lingers on little things like putting on jewelry, driving an old car or setting a table, which gives a pleasant feel to the slow-paced plot. The murder scene is one of the few shocking, fast-paced parts of the whole movie.<br /><br />As a mystery, it's a dismal failure -- it meanders along, providing lots of red herrings, and the surprise finale is an abrupt, epic anticlimax. The biggest mystery is who Ryan Phillipe is. As a period piece and class commentary, it's surprisingly effective -- we not only get to see the \\"downstairs\\" people, but we get a glimpse of how they were used and ignored by the people they worked for, and how snobbery can seep into any social class.<br /><br />Altman also injects a little subtle comedy, such as the inept detective (wonderfully played by Stephen Fry) who ignores everyone of the lower classes. Despite this, you're left to judge the characters by themselves. And he manages to keep things interesting in otherwise boring scenes, by using some elaborate camerawork, slowly rotating as the characters talk about class and position.<br /><br />Maggie Smith is the scene-stealer here, as a barb-tongued old lady who doesn't hold back on anybody. Ryan Phillipe is completely stone-faced, but he seems to be doing so deliberately. Michael Gambon blusters his way through a dull role, but Helen Mirren is outstanding as the housekeeper, and Kelly Macdonald gives off an air of corrupted innocence as Mary.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\" is marred by a dreadful mystery story, but the class commentary and sets are deeply striking.

B00005JNEI|4.0|Say what you will about Michael Moore, call him fat, ugly, unrefined...not one of these apply to his voice. And it's a good thing we have his voice to keep us awake and alert. I know he's not perfect or even couth...but at least he's saying something! If there were 50 other filmmakers right now doing the same thing he does, then well, he may not rank at the top. But bless this guy for holding people personally accountable in this era of self-manufactured fear.    This man is not attacking America; he, like me, is a proud native. I know where I enjoy my freedom, liberties and perks worldwide just like any other American. Michael Moore squarely points the finger to our corrupt political infrastructure...run by money/funding-driven upper-class Americans. Something smells, and the rest of the planet is getting a whiff.    Why don't some people like Moore? He's a constant reminder of our woes, mistakes and the burdens it takes to be an internationally benevolent world power. But somewhere along the way we've become misunderstood...    Scoff at him, but keep score. To judge, you must consider both sides of the story. If you don't see this film and comment on it, your judgment is flawed. This is not a film to like or not like, it's a documentary recording real events; and as in any film, the director is just that, the director, his/her style, slant, passion will always come through (that's why they give awards!)    GWBush is no bigger than life, playing his greatest film role, as a numb, coke-addled puppet that deserves the best actor award for Most Damning Performance. For someone paid 400k a year, this man apparently has a poor grasp of grammar, syntax and even finishing a sentence. I smelled Old Man Bush as GW took up his father's vendetta right where it left off - and he still stinks as his profoundly dumb child puts all Americans in jeopardy at home and globally for decades to come.    See Fahrenheit 9/11...yawn...get angry...shrug it off...hate Michael Moore...just form an informed opinion. It's a shame that a modest man (or woman) cannot ever hope to lead this country. Close your eyes or turn away, that's the easy way. Doing something? Now that's frightening.    Your vote counts this November!*    (*may be void in FL)    P.S. Rich people hate this film, they like things just the way they are...
B00005JKWJ|1.0|'Blade 2' suprisingly was just as horrible as 'Blade 1'.  'Blade 1' was absolutely awful(just look at Wesley Snipes' totally 1991 haircut)and this sequel was just as crackerjack crappy.  The only saving grace is the much underused Donnie Yen(who also did the fight choreography in the first half of the film, which was the half of the movie that sucked slightly less than the other), but he can't even save this turd of a film.  Total Doodie.  Can't wait for the third one to come out.  I'm sure having the girl from '7th Heaven' playing a vampire hunter is totally gonna continue the legacy that is 'Blade'.
0446310786|5.0|There does not seem to be much to add to this book's numerous, and well-deserved, accolades--so all that I will say is that this is a novel that has withstood the test of time.  <br /> <br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD became a classic because of the stories that author Harper Lee intertwined, and the morals that she imparted. The tale itself is complex and Lee's telling of this tale is graceful. <br /> <br />One cannot call oneself a student of American fiction if one has not read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.

1592400876|4.0|I was raised by ruler-swinging, grammar-obsessed schoolteachers on Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\", and at first glance, its 105 well-organized pages seem like a bargain compared to Lynne Truss' (or Truss's, excuse me) twice-as-long book on punctuation. Passionate and unflagging about her topic, the author does have a tendency to pontificate, but at least she is clever about her understandably anal-retentive nature if somewhat uncompromising (as she does warn with her subheading, \\"The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\"). This book has to be the oddest mainstay on the bestseller lists since Francesca Johnson swooned over Robert Kincaid in the disguised Harlequin romance, \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\". But at least Truss's book provides value in the little takeaways that will make readers appear more literate in their next e-mail correspondence.<br /><br />This is my backhanded way of saying that this is a delightful little book. I really enjoyed how she delved into the historical roots of many of the punctuation standards (in particular, abused commas, foreboding semicolons and mysterious hyphens) we take for granted today. But for me, what was particularly interesting was her take on the Internet and how it has introduced yet another form of lexicon with \\"emoticons\\". She disapproves of their use, of course, assuming people should be able to use words to express their emotions, yet there is no getting around the fact that they are a convenient shorthand in a real-time medium that demands responses yesterday ;-).  I think if Truss were more tolerant of these Web-based changes, I could more enthusiastically endorse this book. As it stands, it remains a charming book by someone who loves her subject and makes no apology for being stubborn about how we should all punctuate.
1861976127|5.0|Any anthropologist will reassure your human uniqueness by declaring that language is what sets us apart from the other animals.  Reading some of Truss' [watch that!] examples of how poor punctuation can impair communication will give you pause.  If we fail to use language that imparts meaning, how far along the evolutionary track have we progressed?  For Truss, the \\"English\\" language, with its national subdivisions, seems to offer almost insurmountable barriers to good communication.  Yet, those barriers are all so tiny - commas, dashes, periods - how can they obstruct meaningful words and phrases?<br /><br />The title, with its complex scenarios imparted by a tailed dot, says it all.  Pandas either run amok in restaurants, or they quietly munch on herbiage in some mountain retreat.  One comma transforms completely the meaning of four simple words - without even changing their order.  While adolescents bemoan the rite of learning to write clear sentences, Truss makes abundantly clear why the discipline must be endured.  If you wish to deal with our society, conveying your meaning can be vital.  We've all been inundated with occurances of \\"No.\\" versus \\"No!\\"<br /><br />As with anyone who is jarred by its misuse, Truss is particularly insistent that we properly  apply this little comma with an attitude.  We're all familiar with the \\"greengrocer's\\" syndrome of unwarrentedly applying it to distort a plural.  The famous problem of \\"its\\" versus \\"it's\\" where a possessive doesn't take the mark and the contraction does, still defies easy solution.  The remedy, of course, is to say to yourself what you're typing - forcing a pause in the narrative flow.  Like learning to ride a bicycle, a little practice brings easy familiarity.  The next most obvious stumbling block is that of people's names ending in \\"s\\".  Sticks and stones will never convert me to writing \\"Haines's\\" - try saying it aloud.<br /><br />Truss's [wot?] style keeps you moving easily through this book.  She's able to insert historical references gracefully, the information helping the flow of her presentation.  Her hero, one Aldius Manutius, developed many of the text clarifiers we take for granted today.  Printing, unlike handwritten manuscripts, demanded standards of readability.  Manutius met that need with italics and semicolons, among other innovations.  Truss, while not inventive, applies a fresh approach in helping us learn from his example.  Purists, of course, may deplore her brash style, but when was the last time you picked up a Fowler?<br /><br />If this book has a fault, it's the overly British tone Truss necessarily sets.  While she offers some examples of \\"Americanisms\\", they are little short of condescending.  \\"Inverted commas\\", one of the least meaningful phrases in English grammar, will never overcome \\"quotation marks\\" in depicting what that punctuation accomplishes.  Commas, as Truss emphasises, are a reader's sign to \\"pause\\".  Quotation marks have no such role except to signal the end of speech.  Nor does she note how much American rules have permeated other English-writing nations like Canada or Australia.  Perhaps she failed to anticipate the wide acceptance of this book.<br /><br />Such points, however, are minor and don't dilute the worth of Truss' [!] effort.  Her theme is improved communication.  In a world where punctuation rules are written by Hollywood and the plethora of \\"Sun\\" newspapers, this book is invaluable.  It belongs in the Christmas stocking of every child and should be quietly slipped into the hands of email devotees and business memo writers.  Buy it, read it, and most importantly, put it to use.

0393035158|1.0|Anyone swayed by this twaddle should read chapter nine of Alister McGrath's new book, \\"Twilight of Atheism\\", where he points out that this sort of approach simply makes atheism into a new totalising idea that will lead to violence and exclusion:<br /><br />\\"If atheism saw itself simply as one (ir)religious option among many, there would not be a problem.  Atheism, however, has a disturbing tendency to to see itself as the only true faith, and demands that everyone conform to its beliefs.  Yet Soviet atheism is the true religious philosophy of modernity - a totalizing worldview which demanded that all else give way to its claims.  As the history of the atheist state makes clear, this inevitably sets an agenda for repression and oppression.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yet the twentieth century gave rise to one of the greatest and most distressing paradoxes of human history: that the greatest intolerance and violence of that century were practised by those who believed that religion caused intolerance and violence.\\"<br /><br />...witness the relevations of \\"The Black Book of Communism\\", published in France in 1997, based on extensive research in the archives of the ex-Soviet union, of \\"a grand total of victims variously estimated by contributors to the volume at between 85 million and 100 million\\".

In the end, you conclude that it was so bad it was good.<br /><br />\\"The Whole Ten Yards\\" is like a train wreck... only without the train. It's like the Train company taking out a full page ad in the newspaper to tell everyone that there will be a train wreck at the railroad junction at 5:00 P.M. on Saturday. And you know how it is with train wrecks - they're bad but you just can't look away. Anyway, the people of our town get ready for the 5 PM train wreck. They get blankets and camp out and picnic waiting for the train wreck. They toss the football around and eat cheese and drink wine. Finally, 5:00 approaches and they get ready... and ready... and ready... and 5:00 passes and no train wreck. Minutes pass and people are waiting in postponed anticipation. A half hour passes and people start to get annoyed. An hour passes and people start to leave.... but not all of them. A few remain for 4 hours waiting for the promised train wreck but none occurs - the only thing wrecked was their Saturday afternoon expectations.<br /><br />The plot was vacant and meandering.

B000000W6F|4.0|I got my copy of 'Gish' upon its release back in 1991 on a good old audio-casette. I only recently bought 'Gish' as a CD because the tape had worn out after 13 years. In retrospect the music on 'Gish' clearly demonstrates the great potential of the Smashing Pumpkins already at an early stage in their career. Though not as good as its follow-up, the brilliant 'Siamese Dream' album, 'Gish' still stands out as one the finest records to come out of the early 90's. Everyone serious about good music should own a copy; they don't make 'm like this any longer!

I heard that he saw the movie/documentary 'Supersize Me' and kicked himself for not filming his last 300 trips to McDonalds.  <br /> <br />This film is put together well and has interesting footage that is worth seeing, but the propaganda it spews is just sickening. If you're a liberal you'll love it. If you're a conservative you'll hate it. If you don't care about politics, you'll probably be bored.  <br /> <br />You did know that the whole purpose of this film was to convince you to vote Kerry, right? And if you saw it in theatres, well, you paid upwards of eight bucks to see a prolonged mudslinging fest that up until now only viewers of television campaign ads had to put up with. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and don't pay twenty bucks for the DVD.

Even though the Jews despised Him, He  <br />showed an awesome amount of compassion and love for them,too. <br />I dislike how so many people say that the Jews are responsible <br />for Jesus' death b/c that is totally beside the point! Every single one of us,wheither we're Catholic,Christian,Jew or Pagan <br />we are ALL responsible for the death of Christ. <br />Some people did not cry during the movie,but were deeply moved. <br />Others,were not very moved at all,and still others(like myself:),absolutely cried our eyes out during the whole thing! <br />It really moved me and helped me in my spiritual life as well. <br />I hope that many more people will be touched by this film after <br />reading my review. Mel did an absolutely superb job as well on the photagraphy,location of the filming and the actual story. <br />I really do not think that anyone else could of done a more  <br />professional job. Way to go,Gibson! <br />Jim Caviezel did a great job of acting as Jesus as well. <br />I think of Jesus acting almost the same way as Caviezel potrayed Him in the film. All in all,this movie was just what people like me have been praying and waiting for Hollywood to produce.May there only be more!!!
0694003611|5.0|I remembered this book as a child and decided to look it up to see if it was still around. Sadly, it's only available in reprint now but on the good side the story can be shared with many others. I'm 17 and looking back on it in retrospect this book was very entertaining, with lines that could rival even Shakespeare. Something like, \\"Godnight moon, goodnight spoon\\" cannot be argued with due to it's clear and simple brilliance that flows from page to page. <br /> <br />I would also suggest, Pat the Bunny and Pig William. Both of those books are good but I don't think they have quite the caliber of Goodnight Moon. Pat the Bunny had a pretty cheap story and Pig William had a very distinct and slightly disturbing artistic style. I would review these books again before allowing a younger reader to have read either. Goodnight Moon is a sure hit though!
6302787300|5.0|Don Adrian de Moxica so skillfully portrayed by Michael Wincott. It was, in my opinion, the strongest performance in the entire movie, but unfortunately lasted a mere 35 minutes before... well I won't say in case you have not seen the movie yet.    Aside from Wincott's stunning performance was that of Armande Assante who did an excellent job portraying Sanchez, council to Queen Isabel (Sigouney Weaver).    The soundtrack in strong and moving. Vangelis' music fits perfecly with the gorgeous scenery throughout the entire film. Lots of atmosphere.    Throughout his life, Colon kept the truth of his pedigree carefully hidden, and his birth remains a mystery even to this day. Claimed by Italians as the son of a weaver from the port city of Genoa, he has also been declared a Spaniard mascarading as an Italian.

This movie could have been two hours longer.  <br /> <br />First, I have never read a Potter book so I am not biased that way. I consider Potter to be like literary Crack but they make GREAT movies. Some parts probably could have been left out but overall, it flowed really well. The movie did a good job of keeping you interested in the film and not the kid behind you with the squeaky seat. I realize they were trying to pack in a lot of material but I really didn't notice it. There were no boring parts of the movie. There was lots of suspense and everything fit together in the end. It's a very interesting ride. It was difficult to get used to new actors playing characters but you can get by that after a while.  <br /> <br />I hope the DVD is longer. My daughter read the book and said parts were missing, especially dealing with new characters. I hope they are in the DVD because this was one of my favorite movies.

Furthermore, the ridiculously oversized subtitles cannot be turned off, and many scenes have been unnecessarily deleted from the film. <br /> <br />Avoid this DVD at all costs and seek out an imported copy. The poor quality of this Region 1 release does not warrant the hefty price tag placed upon it.

0393035158|3.0|Harris begins this book splendidly, fully illustrating the depravity and horror that often results from religious faith.  He explicitly shows the religious torture of the Inquisition, witch-burning, Native American genocide, etc., and brings us to the modern-day medieval zealotry of Muslim suicide bombers, attempts to stamp out necessary scientific research, etc.  His book is a clarion call to resist the tide of religious fervor, be it a literalist belief in holy mythology or more moderate forms of acceptance.<br /><br />I came upon this book in a Salon.com review, where the reviewer criticizes Harris for attributing the horrors of religion to religion itself.  Of course, while there may be other motivating factors in acts of atrocity, the factor of heartfelt conviction and belief in the words of an ancient holy book commanding you to annihilate the \\"infidels\\" should not be so easily discounted.<br /><br />However, by chapter four, I found myself wondering who this Harris character is.  He actually points to the Middle East's faith in Islam as an argument for our expansionist policies in the Middle East, and pathetically attempts to debunk Chomsky's foreign policy analysis with some of the most inane and insipid arguments I have ever read.  In a few pages, Harris \\"argues\\" that weapons are not perfect, so we should be resigned to \\"collateral damage\\" (a la Timothy McVeigh), as \\"intent\\" is all that matters.  Bush supposedly has \\"good\\" intent, whereas the terrorists' are supposedly \\"bad,\\" and that's all that matters, consequences be damned.  Harris should talk to his mentor Dershowitz-- full knowledge of the consequence of one's actions may be a species of intent and may be a sufficient finding for \\"depraved heart\\" murder.  \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\\"  When Harris argues in favor of torture, I had the feeling that I was reading one of the Justice Department's memos of mangled legal reasoning by some punk who had spent too much time in philosophy seminars.<br /><br />Harris gets even more nutty after that, and by the final chapter, where he argues that Buddhism is somehow a more rational and scientific practice of self-scrutiny than any other religion, I was just shaking my head.  Really!  Buddhism may have merits that other religions lack, but Harris certainly does not explore these reasons with any proficiency beyond stating that Buddhism is concerned with \\"getting beyond the ego.\\"  Why is \\"ego-annihilation\\" a positive practice, moreso than, say, building up your ego?  Harris does not say to any degree of satisfaction, and it is obvious that he relies on his own \\"faith\\" when making such specious arguments.<br /><br />In sum, this book has some interesting kernels in it, but at the end I simply feel betrayed.  Don't take us on a journey, promising to eviscerate the absurdities of modern mythologies, and then end up arguing \\"Foreign Policy for Idiots\\" and the merits of your own particular brand of mythology.  Harris' idea that his own cockamamie opinions are somehow more \\"rational\\" is, in the end, laughable.  This book will appeal to a very narrow spectrum indeed-- those who are atheist-leaning-towards-Buddhist favorers of bright-line black-and-white moral determinations favoring torture and Zionism.

Don't take us on a journey, promising to eviscerate the absurdities of modern mythologies, and then end up arguing \\"Foreign Policy for Idiots\\" and the merits of your own particular brand of mythology.  Harris' idea that his own cockamamie opinions are somehow more \\"rational\\" is, in the end, laughable.  This book will appeal to a very narrow spectrum indeed-- those who are atheist-leaning-towards-Buddhist favorers of bright-line black-and-white moral determinations favoring torture and Zionism.  Dershowitz aside, such a group is a small sample indeed.
0790731002|2.0|George Clooney was a joke, and while Val Kilmer obviously did his best--which, with his lack of real acting talent meant I appreciated the effort but came away feeling in no way excited or even vaguely interested in Batman/Bruce Wayne--Michael Keaton will \\"forever\\" be the man in this series.  He could play dark and moody and vulnerable while still managing to light up your eyes and ears with genuinely fun lively moments where he's either joking or getting fired up.   <br /> <br />Kilmer is definitely a presence, physically made for the superhero, but he's not an entertaining presence.  He's incapable of making me smile while watching him.  The storylines are depressing; Robin is obnoxious all on his own, but it's even worse considering Batman's popularity from the first 2 films came WITHOUT a sidekick(I think Burton and Co. made a wise calculation that Robin was unnecessary) and so his mere presence doesn't work; Nicole Kidman tries hard, but she just offers more seriousness on top of all the other dead seriousness, bringing down the rest of the film(do we even need more Bruce-backstory?)...the romance with her and Bruce is flat, plus Chase Meridian has to be one of the dumbest names any person, real or fake, has ever been given!   <br /> <br />Jim Carey is perfect for Riddler, but the material he's given isn't all that amusing so Carey has to work extra-hard and ends up as an over-the-top, less-than-memorable villain.  Don't even get me started on Two-Face...Tommy Lee Jones deserves better.  What was he thinking? <br /> <br />The film IS a visual masterpiece but people don't go to movies to watch the sets and cinematography--especially a Batman film.  Ultimately, I think this film brought the downfall of the Batman franchise, not the next one.  Just like with Superman, the first 2 films were wonderful and imaginative, drawing you in with compelling characters and stories--and with a level of pure comic book-style entertainment.  The proof in how destructive the third films were can be seen in how little anticipation and excitement there was for \\"Superman IV\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\".  \\"Batman Forever\\" was a must-see for me and my friends because the first 2 rocked!  Especially \\"Batman Returns\\".  But we came away with mixed feelings from number 3.  So when the fourth installment came around, it's like \\"WHO CARES?!\\".  What's the point?  All the luster and energy disappeared.  Superman IV certainly was better than Superman III, but the damage had been done with how awful the third film was.  Then, it makes people believe it's all downhill from here and what comes next isn't worth our hard-earned money.  That shouldn't happen if the previous film is good--Batman Forever failed to keep people on the Batman bandwagon and the series died.  And nobody seems to care, they're even relieved it's been put out to pasteur.   <br /> <br />The film can be a great watch at times, whether from cool stunts and gadgetry to the futuristic Gotham to the antics of the villains...but the entire film gets bogged down in being either extremely surreal(the villains) or extremely depressing(Robin losing his whole family, among other things) and boring(backstory and \\"romance\\").  In the end, it just doesn't compare to the Batman given to us by Burton and Keaton. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0784011710|5.0|You may consider from now to Meryl Streep as one of the twenty best actress of the XX century . Her magnetism is so powerful in every performance she makes than it is impossible to ignore her.<br /><br />Nevertheless her last performances in screen have been extremely geometric meticulous cold and apollinean without that expresivity we can watch in this film .<br /><br />She was in the peak of her powers . And in fact she supports the film like at least in a 95% .<br /><br />The script was brilliant writen in the best european style . Resource economy , but with fine dialogues and excellent edition and superb photography .<br /><br />Kevin Kline made the best acting of all his career in the role of this disturbed man .<br /><br />The film is told in off for Sophie herself . Her hell stage in the concentration camp . Thanks to her domain of the german language she could survive .<br /><br />But after the horror has gone , she can not avoid to remake her emotional life . In this sense the dramatic parallel runs equal with the pawnbroker , since the memory and its multiple awful images simply can not be erased , even the happiness had been to few steps from her .<br /><br />The film was carefully filmed with masterful direction .<br /><br />Superb and consider this work and Schindler list as the supremes american films focusing this painful theme!
B000002KIE|4.0|I don't hate this record; in fact, it's good, great even. But it's definitely not the best punk record ever. I mean, really, there are numerous punk records which blow this one away: London Calling, Pink Flag, Damned Damned Damned, Entertainment!, the first Ramones record, the first Clash record, Hex Enduction Hour, Singles Going Steady, Raw Power, etc. It gets on my nerves that numerous lists proclaim this to be the greatest punk record ever. Sure, it was probably the most notorious. Sure, it was very influential. But does that make it the best? Not a chance.  The songs are all rather good; they're purposely nihlistic and obnoxious. John Lydon's vocals are gloriously snotty; Steve Jones' guitar reaches some great dirty heights. The production, however, is much too polished. It worked for something like London Calling by The Clash, but here, the songs just aren't strong enough to justify the smooth edges. Sure, \\"Holiday In The Sun,\\" \\"God Save The Queen,\\" \\"Problems,\\" and \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" burst out of their polished confines, but everything else here would have benefitted from a rougher mix.    Some other debated points:  The Sex Pistols were somewhere between a real band and a marketing gimmick. I don't think it's the black-and-white issue it's made out to be, and the documentary The Filth & The Fury sheds some light onto this. Their attempts to get in people's hair were rather brilliantly obnoxious, but I doubt the Pistols would have wanted the title of \\"greatest punk band\\" ever. I mean, Lydon's post-Pistols outfit Public Image Ltd. made some better music (see Metal Box).  And Sid Vicious couldn't really play. He was there for image more or less. And on top of that, he wasn't really that good of a person. Why he's worshipped by numerous young punks is beyond me. Glen Matlock wrote the beyond superb \\"Ghosts Of Princes In Towers.\\" Sid drunkenly covered \\"My Way.\\"   Never Mind The Bollocks... is still a great record, I won't deny it that. But the best? Not at all. This is more like a watered-down Raw Power by The Stooges, but a good imitation still.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Tarantino disappoints with this film. <br /> <br />Here's the plot.  Uma Thurman is beaten nearly to death by a handful of associates.  Upon waking up from a coma 4 years later, she sets out to extract revenge from those people. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie consists of Tarantino using excessive violence to cover up the gaping lack of substantive plot.  \\"Excessive violence\\" is probably too weak a term to describe the action in this movie.  Any body part you'd care to name probably has a scene dedicated to its forceful removal at the hands of Uma Thurman or Lucy Liu or her henchmen. <br /> <br />The problem with the movie isn't the violence, though.  The violence is only symptomatic of the bigger problem which is that Tarantino is clearly out of ideas.  The story only progresses because Thurman keeps defeating her enemies as if this were nothing more than a real-life video game. <br /> <br />In a stylistic sense, Tarantino is great.  His use of sound, colors, and lighting play a large part in fooling the audience into enjoying this movie.  He is a master director, but his writing star is setting.  It must be hard to hit a home run again after smash hits like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't even make it to first base on this outing. <br /> <br />Buy the film if you are a die-hard Tarantino fan.  If you aren't a fan, I can't recommend renting it.  This film offers nothing but pornographic violence on a pretty set.  Tarantino has done much better in the past.  This film is a disapointing wreck.  2 stars.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I remember 2 years ago when Firefly premiered.  I tried it out and within 15 minutes of the pilot I changed channels.  Maybe it was just a mood, I don't know.  But I have several friends that swear by this show so I rented it, then immediately bought it.  What a fantastic show this was (and in April 2005 will be a motion picture).  I can't rave enough about the quality of acting and writing in this short-lived series.  Neither myself nor my wife are easily hooked into a TV show but we both were right from the beginning. <br />It's a kindof western sci-fi, where post-wartime humans are pushing out into the \\"wilderness\\" of space.  The show portrays these little bands of poorly-stocked colonies in a western motif (maybe how it would actually be with little or no supplies), while the center of \\"civilization\\" planets are more urbane and clean.  The crew of the Serenity routinely travel between the richer inner-planets and poor outer ones, looking for their fortunes and running into all kinds of trouble. <br />Don't let the fusion of wild west and sci-fi trip you up -- it's really quite brilliant and probably more realistic than the way traditional sci-fi is portrayed with sterile environments and beautiful overeducated people.
B0000DCGT4|2.0|What American Wedding lacks in heart and humor, it makes up for in embarrassing gross-out scenes.  Apparently not realizing that the key to the success of the first two movies is the spiritual journey that the friends undertake as their lives change, the writers of American Wedding throw one gross out comedic scene after another.  The jokes wear very thin by the end. <br /> <br />The story is very simple.  Jim and Michelle have been dating for a few years and now want to get married.  The rest of the movie is a series of goof ups, gross outs, and scene after scene of Steve Stifler doing stupid things.  With so much focus on the antics of Stifler, the wedding plot is almost completely drowned out. <br /> <br />The worst part of the movie is not the juvenile humor, though.  The problem is that the jokes are telegraphed so that the audience already knows exactly what the punchline will be before the joke is actually executed.  It's one thing to cleverly set up a joke, but this movie shouts from the rooftops, \\"Hey, we're telling a joke here!  Haha!  Stifler doesn't realize it's actually Jim's grandmother in the closet! Haha!  Get it??\\" <br /> <br />This movie could have been written and executed much better.  Instead of trying to build heart around the humor, the writers could have (as they did in the first two movies) built the humor around the heart. <br /> <br />The cast did the best they could, especially Eugene Levy reprising his role as the ever-caring dad.  However, the script is not salvageable and the movie falls flat despite the best efforts of all the actors involved. <br /> <br />This movie is not one you will want to own.  It really isn't even worth renting.  1.5 stars rounded up to 2 stars for this one.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I've developed quite a fondness for these movies, even before my kids decided they were cool.  But Azkaban was missing the charm and magic (no pun intended) of the first two under the direction of Chris Columbus.  This new guy injected a dark and dreary atmosphere that undid the whimsical quality that Columbus accomplished.  It isn't just a different director's vision - it's a bad one.  This could have been any movie about some magic-oriented kids (did they really have to lose the school uniforms and just hang around in jeans?).  There was nothing Harry Potter about it other than the names.  It just missed the mark. <br />Still, it's not a total loss.  If you like the first two just be prepared for a different experience.  As a movie fan I generally find good qualities in all movies and this is no exception.  Gone is the \\"discovery\\" phase of Potter and Friends.  What's here now is the gang settling into their roles and \\"universe\\" to get down to business.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Let`s cut to the chase. I loved this movie. It`s the best Peter Pan movie yet (and I`m not saying that just because I have a small crush on Jeremy Sumpter, the boy who plays Peter in the film). It`s the most faithful to the book, and it is entertaining. It has something for everyone. So, I liked it.
B000059XUO|5.0|Leave it to a family curse to claim the life of a man that would have been brought to superstar status with this movie. Brandon Lee gave the performance of his life (no pun intended) and poured his soul out into the character of Eric Draven. The dark feel of this movies mixed with the brights of Eric evolve this movie into an action packed ride that is one of my personal favorites. The story is good (because Brandon brought the trade paperback of James O. Barr's The Crow with him instead of his script.), the acting is phenomenal. This movie is the s...stuff! Buy it!
0440237688|2.0|I first read this book in seventh grade, for a book report. I had mixed feelings about certain parts, but ultimately hated it. It was too sci-fi for my tastes. <br />I read it again recently, and I still don`t really like it. It`s too confusing, too scifi-ish,  too many twists and turns. <br />So, my opinion: unless you absolutely have to read it (like for a school report or something), skip this book.

B0000025P9|5.0|Toto is one of the bands that started as an FM rock staple in the 70's, similiar to Foreigner, Kansas, Styx, and the many other acts, but made the transition to become a Top 40 pop/rock act. \\"Toto IV\\" was the album that redefined the type of music that the L.A. supergroup would release. <br /> <br />Many who are familiar with the early music of Toto would call the group a hard rocking bunch in vein with many album rock artists. This changed with \\"Toto IV\\", where the band made more accessable and mainstream pop/rock. The album launched three top ten hits with the number ones \\"Roseanna\\" and \\"Africa\\" and the top ten \\"I won't hold you back.\\" The album tracks are also strong, such as \\"Make Believe.\\" The jazzy and smooth pop would later be defined as \\"west-coast pop\\" or \\"L.A. pop.\\" Because of the originality of the sound, and the beautiful instruments, the album went on to win numerous grammies, including album of the year. Many may think home cooking was involved (most of the band have relatives that are in some way related to the grammy board), but the album did have many strong cuts and a sound that was second to none. <br /> <br />Though this is a great album, it isn't perfect. Some songs are filler, though they are few and far between. Also those used to the hard rocking sound of earlier Toto might be disappointed by the number of slower paced, pop sounding songs that fill the album up. Still, for most music fans, this is a must have for great pop/rock and is a good introduction to a very talented group of musicians. Also recommended are the self-titled release, \\"Hydra\\", and any of their other earlier work. After this album, the group was happy with a job well done, and went on to help in the production of the smash \\"Thriller\\" and other side projects.
B00003CXCT|1.0|With over 800 reviews posted so far, I feel there is little to be said about the actual content of these movies we know so well.  I do wish to comment on the issue of the special editions.  Yes, the rights are owned by Lucas and he has the legal right to release what he wants, and if he wants to digitally replace mark Hamill with Brad Pitt, or make C-3P0 green, then he has the legal right to do so.  But why affirmatively withhold the original versions that I and millions around the world prefer?  Why try to do everything possible to erase the very existence of the original version (believe you me, if he could go back in time and destroy all the VHS versions of the original trilogy, my bet is he would do so!)  My goodness, he would make billions more releasing the originals on DVD!  Maybe he will do so in the future, but I doubt it.  I just think he cares not a whit for what the original fans, who made him a billionaire in the first place, actually want to see.  I feel there is some sort of neurosis at work here.  Is he ashamed of the original version of Star Wars-- the most popular movie ever made?  What is there to be ashamed of?  Does he hold contempt for his fan base?  Or is it just that he has become a sheltered old man surrounded by yes men, permanently out of touch with the world?  I don't know, but it is puzzling.   <br /> <br />It won't take much to make things right George.  Heck-- if he would just release the special version without the Greedo shoots first scene, all would be forgiven!  Is that too much to ask?
0440418569|4.0|Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is a remarkably ambitious and carefully constructed fantasy, and it's highly readable: as they say, a rattling good yarn. Still, big claims have been made for it by many readers, and Pullman himself makes his ambitions as a mythologist and cosmographer clear, with virtually every chapter decorated with epigraphs from Milton's _Paradise Lost_ and from Blake's Prophetic Books. Perhaps as a response I find myself strangely disappointed with the series, since the incredibly rich fantasy world of the books ends up squashed between, on the one hand, a standard-issue the-fate-of-the-universe-is-hanging-by-a-thread adventure story, and on the other, a fair bit of preachiness.  <br /> <br />I suppose I can't complain at how much of-its-time the books seem now, even though they were written so recently, in the 1990s. The series' preoccupations and themes include: quantum physics; chaos theory; many-universes theories; panpsychism; global warming and pollution; traditional healing and herbology; shamanism; mental illness and depression; witches as wise and benificent rather than evil figures; angels (gay angels, even); a virulent hostility to organized religion (with the church portrayed as an insanely self-righteous, authoritarian institution, with a particular fondness for abusing children while claiming to do them good); a matching suspicion of technology and science as embodying power without concern for ethics. Still, Pullman can be very crude and schematic in the exposition of these themes: e.g. here's a sample bit of dialogue (admittedly an untypically bad passage): <br /> <br />\\"When I first saw you, in your Oxford,\\" Lyra said, \\"you said one of the reasons you became a scientist was that you wouldn't have to think about good and evil. Did you think about them when you were a nun?\\" <br />    \\"Hmm. No. But I knew what I _should_ think: it was whatever the Church taught me to think. And when I did science, I had to think about otherthings altogether. So I never had to think about them for myself at all.\\" <br />&c <br /> <br />The other problem is that Pullman's inventiveness as a fantasist - marvellous things like the carefully worked out idea of a world where everyone has a \\"daemon\\" (animal-shaped familiar), like an embodied soul; or the eerie wraith-haunted cite of Citagazze - is not matched by an inventiveness in plotting. The novels are far too reliant on a quick succession of cliffhangers, and there's a distressing tendency to have another character step in unannounced at the last second to save the heroes or otherwise advance the plot. A lot of the dependence on fortunate coincidence and eleventh-hour rescues is papered over by the implication that much of the action is directed by Fate, but it's hard not to feel this is a nice way of giving weight to what's really the novelist's convenience. (Similarly for Pullman's habit of killing off characters the moment their function in the plot is done: there's a particularly bloody pileup at the end of book 2, _The Subtle Knife_.) There are also some weak points in the plotting: in particular, here, the inexplicable stupidity of the powerful angelic Regent Metatron. <br /> <br />But ultimately the most serious problem is that, between the pellmell plotting and overarching \\"serious\\" concerns, the characters are pancake-flat. The most interesting is surely Mrs Coulter, who is genuinely evil and yet turns out curiously sympathetic (presumably this is in part Pullman's homage to Milton's portrait of Satan). But Lyra and especially Will don't have much depth: both of them are given a slightly one-noted fixation on a loved one (Lyra's friend Roger, & Will's mother) and are likeable enough, but they're otherwise generic examples of pluckiness & determination. You'd have thought that Pullman would have noticed that one of the significant achievements of his beloved Milton was the delineation of character: Satan, the various rebel angels, and Eve. <br /><br />None of this is to say the series isn't a success on its own terms: as an adventure and as a delineation of a fantasy world it's excellent. But I was hoping for more. <br />
1400032717|5.0|Part Mystery and part lesson learned about the autistic, this is an excellent book to read. Hard to put down, filling your mind with the pages you read. I rate this book highly with books such as Running With Scissors,Dry,Lost Boy and Nightmares Echo. Worth your time to read books.
0743244257|4.0|Cosmopolis is the 13th novel by Don DeLillo. It tells the story of a day in the life of a billionaire asset manager - a day spent mostly in his white stretch limousine, and a day when the currency market crashes (due mostly to his interference) and bankrupts him. <br /> <br />It's also a day anarchists take over Times Square, a day he makes love to his wife for the first time, and the day he sees what he believes is his own demise in his pocket watch. <br /> <br />Were Cosmopolis any longer, I think it would be a failure as a novel. As it is, the unevenness become unbearable toward the last 10 pages or so. <br /> <br />Aside from that, this is a provocative novel with a great array of images, ideas, and characters. Clocking in at 208 pages, it's a perfect length for its subject matter. I loved the passages with his Chief of Theory - she was certainly the most interestingly drawn character. <br />
0765301598|3.0|The main complaint I've had with this set of prequels were: the one dimensional characters (even the difference in the writing style didn't take away from the trilogy as much as the poor characters did).  The House Trilogy was not brought down by this problem to the degree found in the Legends of Dune trilogy, as most of those characters were already established by Frank Herbert and Brian only had to take them from point A to B which what seems like the the help of a very detailed outline.  But with the Legend Trilogy, it seems like Brian and Kevin were probably left mostly to their own means and sadly the readers were left with characters we didn't care about.  Personally, I thought young Serena and Vorian were annoying and sometimes acted incomprehensibly (as well as the idiotic Rayna later on), didn't identify with Xavier (although I felt quite a bit of sympathy for him once I found out he was basically a good man and knowing how history would remember his family) and was completely disappointed in Ginjo's character development from a trustable leader to a corrupt politician.   <br /> <br />But over time, Vor grew on me and sort of endeared himself to me as we began to see in him the same things that would make the Atreides who they are (his way with his men, ability to make decisive decisions, hawk features and crest and mild cynism).  Through him we also saw why things are the way that they are in Paul's time (the fate and destiny of the Butlers, why there were prohibitions against machines and basically why the Corrinos were allowed to take the throne when they were known to be corrupt).  I would have liked to have seen from which one of Vor's descendants Paul came from, since there was such a big question mark at the end, whether the descendents of his twin sons would become the Atreides of classic Dune, or whether they'd come from a bastard line, or whether he'd properly settle down on Caladan with another girl and start the noble line.  With the beginning of the feud, I found that he came out rather bitter Duke Leto style, something that we really didn't see coming, but then again, considering Abulard's actions, it probably was warranted.  But still, I wish they'd gone into the depth of the betrayl, considering Abulard was the only person he treated as a son.  I'm also beginning to wonder how history remembered Vorian?  It must have, even if his own accomplishments were to be shadowed by later descends.  <br /> <br />For the sake of finding out how the political, social, genetic and economical structures of Dune were created, this book is worth a read even without there being any characters with the depth of Paul Atreides or his mother.
0783117523|4.0|This movie is great in all seirousness, the story lines are good, the actors are too and, in addition, it's a true story. Not being a fan of Angie, I was sceptical at the idea of watching taht movie but I bought it for my girl and I liked it a lot. <br /> <br />The but comes from the fact taht the lesbian story isn't quite plausible, I must admit that Gia was addicted to affection as much as drugs. The fact taht she goes back to the same girl even if she rejected her is possible but taht many times.... I doubt it. <br /> <br />But on a general overview, taht movie is a masterpiece! I recommand it to anyone who wants to cry (you get attach to the main character)
B00006CXSS|5.0|These are excellent films and are well done cinematically.  I've watched the whole thing from start to finish several times, and i especially like the \\"We Stand Alone Together\\" documentary.  The \\"Field Guide\\" on each disc is a valuable resource for those not familiar with military lingo, and the summaries of the soldiers are great little bios on the real men behind the partially fictionalized characters of the episodes. <br /> <br />This is no perfect historical account, though.  While a majority of the stories on film sound a lot like the ones from the Ambrose book of the same title, there seem to be some inconsistencies with some other WWII sources; most notably David K. Webster's and Donald Burgett's, two guys who served with 2nd Batallion, 506th, throughout most of the ETO.  There are also huge gaps and missing paratroopers throughout the entire series.  Several men are interviewed in the documentary, but they don't show up in any of the episodes whatsoever, or are merely mentioned by name only (Earl McClung, JB Stokes).  Other troopers are showed only briefly (such as Ed Tipper), and many characters slip in and out of the stories without much explanation on their conspicuous absences.  (Other troopers who are named by Webster in his memoirs don't show up in the films, either...it's predominantly a view of the company from Dick Winters' perspective.) <br /> <br />For example: Sargeant Ranney gets busted down to private in England in episode one, wins a service cross for his participation in the attack on the German guns in episode two, and then doesn't show up again for the rest of the series, with no explanation of his fate.  (He's also not listed with the KIA's at the end of the documentary... perhaps he was injured and discharged, or transferred.) <br /> <br />Some of the actions are not described accurately, but this can be forgiven; sometimes the actual events weren't nearly as exciting and would have made lousy episodes if they were re-created exactly. <br/> <br />Overall, the series does a good job of showing what it must have been like for some veterans, epsecially those who fought in the Bulge.  It is, however, a fictionalized account based on actual events, and should be viewed with that in mind.   <br /> <br />As with most Stephen Ambrose works, one gets the impression that the US, and specifically the 101st Airborne Division, won the war single-handedly, and this is hyperbole.  But it does make for great filmmaking, and any WWII buff should enjoy these films.
0064407667|2.0|This was an interesting book, although I thought it had a stronger beginning than ending. The three children are good characters, smart and unique. It is an interesting idea that they have such bad luck, similar to say, an Edward Gorey book.<br /><br />  The villain, Count Olaf, is truly repulsive, and treats the children horribly. Some of my points of contention arise in the segment involving the Count. First of all, it is very hard for me to believe that the children, having many opportunities to do so, would not tell their kind neighbor Justice Strauss how horribly they were being treated by the Count. Intelligent children such as these, I'm sure would know when the help of an outside adult is needed, and it is hard for me to believe that Mr. Poe, the dead parents' friend would not believe them when they tried to tell him. Also I feel this book failed to build up a sufficient amount of suspense.<br /><br />  However, it was interesting, and I am curious to read book two of the series.
B00006BTCA|5.0|The cd is worth the money. I recently saw them in Denver (Aug04) they put on a great show in their cute ties. Paul is dreamy.
B00005JKJA|5.0|What is it all about? Can you know? Does it matter? An important film, one of those that is timely and hits a nerve, the right nerve that makes a lasting impression. This is the stuff of dreams. And dreams it seems to be about, the kind you have when you are asleep, the kind you have no control over, the kind that dominate your waking life, the dreams for success, and where does a dream become a nightmare?<br /><br />  Great acting, great achetypal characters - the director, the cowboy, and the women, mysterious dual-natured women, a theme present in mythology throughout time. And this film is like a mythology for today: the mythology of movie making and the Hollywood star, and the money and sex that runs the machine. Sensual, visual, stunning score and cinematograpy, a cinematic opera. A film that exists somewhere in the unconscious, a place where David Lynch makes himself at home, a master of the film medium.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can say, without shame, that 'Moulin Rouge' is my very favorite movie - ever. Indeed, this film started me on Baz Luhrmann.    Many critics have deemed the modern musical as a long music video on stereoids. I could not disagree more. 'Moulin Rouge' is definitely two hours worth of pure eye candy, music to sing along to, and lines to laugh at. The movie will also appeal to people of many generations, as most of the songs are redone from older songs, such as: 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' 'Silly Love Songs,' 'Like a Virgin,' 'Your Song,' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.' The list goes on. I definitely recommend the soundtrack if you enjoyed this old music with new pizzazz.    'Moulin Rouge' will make you laugh, cry, sing, and dance. It will leave you wanting more. Plus, to some, the overall picture of this story will make you think. What is important in life? Fame and fortune? Or love and happiness?    Baz does an excellent job directing the cinematography. The colors are lush, and there is always movement. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous.    Moreover, the DVD is also a true find. If you liked the film, you will absolutely love the DVD. There are so many extras, where does one begin? There are numerous mini documentaries about the dancing, the special effects, and so much more. The DVD features cast interviews, cut or expanded scenes, and dance scenes with different angles. Definitely worth the extra dollars!    Overall, I highly recommend this amazing, beautiful, thoughtful, and exquisite film. It is definitely a must-see, and worth not five stars, but all the stars in the sky!
079073804X|5.0|Darkly directed by William Fredkin in '73, this grotesquly (I mean that in a good way)adapted film from William Peter Blatty's novel(equally nightmare-inducing) is a must see.  <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is, this DVD is more than just a DVD; it provides commentaries by both the writer and director, a comprehensive documentary on the painstaking efforts put into this classic thriller, and even a collection of little known-info on the true story behind the film.  <br />Blatty's intention's, it turns out, were not to produce a horror film at all, but an insightful look into modern religious issues, the question of faith, and a battle between good and evil through the oppression of a child. <br /> <br />The acting--especially on Burstyn's part as the tormented mother--is startlingly good all around. Von Syndow is perfect as Merrin, and who could forget Mercedes McCaimbridge's voice coming out of that creature tied down to the bedposts? Not me! <br /> <br />If your looking for behind the scenes info on how Linda Blair floated in midair over  the bed, you may be disappointed. In the commenatary, Fredkin mentions a few times that it isn't so important on HOW it was achieved, but rather what it stirs up in us. <br />The documentary is one of the most well-done and mind-blowing I've ever seen on a DVD, bar nun. <br /> <br />In \\"The Version You've Never Seen\\" DVD, the additional scenes are startling, if not downright pants-wetting good (pardon my expression) but somewhat out of context, as Fredkin notes in the sub-audiotrack, and I agree.  <br />The 25th Annversary DVD is the full THEATRICAL version, pure cinematic genius. Even the \\"Tubular Bells\\" tag-theme is a great peice of work (the story on Fredkin's choosing of the composition is in the documentary). <br /> <br />NOTE: Best if viewed with a group of friends (who haven't seen it before), in the dark, at night--and you might wish to bring a few of those smiley-face airsick bags, just in case! The initial relese of the film into New York theaters alone brought about almost 300 walk-outs, numerous remored heart-attacks, and yes, many of the weak-stomached did toss thier cookies by the time little Linda began masturbating with the crucifix--it's all true. Blatty even notes that, upon his first viewing of the film, two or three ambulances were parked in the lot behind the theater. Controversy is a good thing folks, don't despise it. <br /> <br />So if your in the mood for a DVD that's not only a masterpeice beyond compare, but a thorough look into the mind's of it's crators, you've come to the right place. <br /> <br />Saw it, wanted it, had a fit, now own it, <br />--GIGI
B00003CXPJ|5.0|The first time I saw 'Zoolander,' I was sort of confused. It was just so stupid, so random, so... I had to watch it again. The second time around, I suspect that I liked it much more because now it is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite Ben Stiller film. Actually, now, whenever I see a Stiller movie, I can't help but think that he's still the stud with spikey black hair. <br /> <br />The entire film is a mockery of the fashion industry. Wait, not just the industry, but also of fame, fortune, and beauty. 'Zoolander' quips male models ('I'm sure he knows about styling gel - he's a male model.'), the fashion of 'normal' people ('I do not like snoopy reporter with lack of fashion sense.'), and the stupidity of the people in the industry ('What is this? A center for ants?'). <br /> <br />'Zoolander' is also a goldmine for celebrity cameos, ranging from David Bowie, to Natalie Portman. <br /> <br />Overall, 'Zoolander' is definitely a goofy comedy, but if you give it a chance, you just might find it perfect to tickle your funnybone!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Still, Star Warriors will want to add this set to the shelf, along with all the various editions of VHS. Relive the shining innocence of \\"Star Wars\\", the grim drama of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and the campy fun and stunning special effects of \\"Jedi\\" once again. May the Force be with us forever!
B0000CNY27|5.0|Nearly a quarter century after its release, this grim, gritty vision of the future continues to thrill. Kirk Douglas, in one of his finer dramatic roles, plays hardened criminal Snake. Carpenter's talent for suspense is as evident in sci-fi as his horror gem \\"Halloween.\\" Also recommend his remake of \\"The Thing.\\"
B00003CXBK|5.0|After I watched trailer and read different customers reviews on this web-site, I decided to rent it first. There are several reasons why, after renting it, I decided to buy it for my home collection:<br /><br />1) Quality of picture. I was impressed the way this cartoon is created. There is no computer enhancement - just pure paint works with wonderful vivid colours. I enjoyed watching beautiful landscapes and realistic characters.<br /><br />2) A story. After watching \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\", I realized that Japanese animated stories are always unique, interesting and catching. I wasn't bored a second! Even though there is some violence, the main themes of the movie are love, support and kindness.<br /><br />3) Music. The music for this movie is composed by the acclaimed Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi. Based on the score for this movie, Joe Hisaishi released a separate symphonic suite. The main theme of the movie is a popular hit in Japan; it is being played or sung by various artists.<br /><br />I can watch this movie several times, as I like quality of animation, the story and the music.  This DVD includes a version of the movie dubbed in French. As I learn French I think I have an excellent chance to learn it with such a pleasant DVD!<br /><br />Conclusion: I made a good investment buying this product. There aren't many quality animations on the market. This one is a gem that I didn't want to miss.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Now, I must first state what Kill Bill vol. 1 is NOT before I can continue with this review.  If you expect it to be any of these things, you will be disappoined and likely thoroughly hate the movie.<br /><br />It is not deep and thought-provoking.  It is not family friendly.  It is not meant to be taken seriously.  It is not a movie wherein the violence is justified.<br /><br />That done, I will tell you what it IS, and why I rated it so highly.  It is one of the best homage/parodies of Hong Kong action flicks I have ever seen.  If you are even passingly familiar with HK action movies (particularly the martial arts ones from the '70s), it's easy to see how this movie was so heavily influenced by them.  It has some of the most amusingly orchestrated violence I have seen.  When someone's limb is cut off and the blood gushes twenty feet in the air, it's very hard to take the violence TOO seriously, but at the same time the fights are beautifully choreographed.<br /><br />I must state again that this isn't really a movie to be taken seriously.  When you see a shot of Tokyo's international airport and almost EVERYONE has a katana strapped to their belts, that's a pretty good sign that this movie is all in good (mindlessly bloody and amusing) fun.<br /><br />(As a side note, this DVD has one of the most interesting and well-executed menus I've seen.  The transitions are all very smooth, and when the music and visuals loop, it's not all that jarring.)
B0000025D0|5.0|\\"just great\\" would be sufficient to express this album in words. In the beginning 'Badlands' thunder into your ears , talking about the perdition of a man in his Badlands , where he hates to be and is in fact the Hell of a man's worst dreams. They make the poor man do the heavy work and the man complain. Adam and his son Caine are the topics of his second song- Cain is the first vampire,a son of Adam who slayed his brother . 'Something in the Night' is a slowly progressing ballad. 'Candy's Room' is no more than three minutes long but what a little more than 2 minutes pinner. My love affairs remind me Candy. The tempo now is subdued in 'Racing in the Streets' and then uptempoed in the 6th song, 'The Promised Land' namely. 'Factory' is one of the ,i think ,the lowkeys of this album.'Streets of Fire' precedes the 9th song and, the eponymous track ends the album. The last track is another lowkey if i may say what i believe.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This album is usually referred to be Grateful Dead's most successful studio masterpiece. The band's music is country-rock and folk-rock oriented. The opener 'Box Of Rain' has meaningful lyrics [look out of any window.any morning,any evening, any day. maybe the sun is shining, birds are winging.no rain is falling from a heavy sky] . It is about love and life. Most popular verse is [inch your way through dead dreams to another land] . 'Friend Of The Devil' , coming second, has humorous lyrics [Got a wife in Chino babe, and one in Cherokee. First one says she got my child, but it don't look like me]. 'Sugar Magnolia' is about a sexy girl [Sweet blossom] who is empty in the head [Head's all empty and i don't care]. 'Operator' is a medium-paced one. Whereas 'Candyman', 'Ripple', 'Brokedown Palace', 'Attics Of My Life' are for the most time slowly progress. 'Till The Morning Comes', and 'Trucking' well come following the first three songs in pace. It is in 'Truckin' that \\"What a long,strange trip it's been\\" is pronounced. I enjoy most listening to the first three that is: 'Box Of Rain', 'Friend Of The Devil' and 'Sugar Magnolia'.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE live album except i think the first 3 tracks are the lowkeys. These first three songs are of blues-rock type. And believe when i say they mar the beauty of what is to come in the rest of the album. Buy this for only last 4 tracks. And see what jamming is all about. And a flawless one. You Don't Love Me is inexplicable. Instrumentation, virtuosity, versatility. Hot 'Lanta reminds me of the soundtrack of the soap opera Streets of San Francisco. In Memory of Elizabeth Reed is a long great instrumental. Whipping Post by Gregg Allman is from the debut album of the band.
B000003CMD|5.0|The boy on the cover is depicted as a kin to the band personnel on the inner page. There is a small girl at the back of the cd cover. In this album which is a tribute to recently died bassist Berry Oakley, we see Oakley in 3 of the songs. Lamar Williams is the new bassist in 4 other songs. Les Dudek is another added guitarist. We see 4 songs 'Ramblin Man', 'Southbound', 'Jessica' and 'Pony Boy' composed by D. Betts. Others are by Gregg Allman. 'Wasted Words' opens the album. The very popular 'Ramblin Man'[When it's time for leaving,i hope you understand, 'cause i was born a ramblin' man]-Rambling=wandering) and 'Come and Go Blues' and 'Jelly Jelly' take us to 'Southbound'[Lord i'm southbound,lord i'm comin' home to you]. 'Southbound' is a vibrant boogeey song.The instrumental epic- 'Jessica' makes you wonder how such a harmony in instrumentation and complexity are possible. 'Pony Boy' features slide guitar playing by Mr. Dickey Betts.
B00000255F|5.0|This album was produced in a very low budget. However the success was so effective that Boss appeared simultaneously on Newsweek and Time magazines as a phenomenon after the launch of his third album (the title album). 'Thunder Road' , penned to a woman to persuade,who is afraid to come along with the hero. The hero says , 'i know it's too late but we can make it if we Run'. Stunning lyrics! 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-out' features saxophone work by Mr. Clarence Clemons, a saxophonist turned old time heavyweight boxer. An injury ended his professional boxing career. The third song 'Night' and the fourth : 'Backstreets' need the attention of the listener. This is not pop music, remember. All through the recordings orchestration is employed. Just like Roy Orbison did in his times. Roy Orbison and Woody Guthrie, 2 musicians Boss was influenced by. The title track says it all:'We are the working class and we need to run and lose no time to make a living.' 'She is the One' , 'Meeting across the River'-a slow song evolve into the ending track , the exciting, lustrous 'Jungleland'. And i believe the most complex song is this album ender. This record is , i believe, an essential.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This is one of my favorite megadeth albums.  Some classic Megadeth tracks are on here, but this album was always looked as one of megadeths worst because of the production.  Now that this album is newly remixed and remastered by Dave Mustaine himself, it sounds like it was supposed to- great songwriting without all that reverb.   <br />     This is Megadeth's 3rd album, and it features their second recording lineup- Dave Mustaine, David Ellefson, Chuck Behler, and Jeff Young.   <br /> <br />Into the Lungs of Hell:  9/10 <br />The instrumental introduction to the album, and a good one at that. <br /> <br />Set the World Afire:  10/10 <br />This is the first song that Dave wrote after being fired from Metallica in 1983, originally titled \\"Megadeth\\".  This is one of the highlights of the album, with some cool lyrics and a great guitar solo from Jeff Young. <br /> <br />Anarchy in the UK:  10/10 <br />A cover of the infamous Sex Pistols song.  I think its really cool that Dave covered a punk song, because I've always thought that Megadeth had elements of punk in their sound.   <br /> <br />Mary Jane:  10/10 <br />This song includes more great guitar riffage and many tempo changes.  Definately one of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />502:  8/10 <br />Well, you can tell that Dave was on Drugs when he wrote this song, with a lame imatation of a siren by dave, and some of the worst lyrics he's ever written (Pull over sh**head, its the cops), but I still like the song, because it adds to the overall mood of the album.   <br /> <br />In My Darkest Hour:  10/10 <br />Definately the best on the album.  It was also written after he found out about Cliff Burton's death, when his understanding of \\"someone being there for you\\" was born.  Some of Daves best lyrics are featured here.  There is also a new intro on the Remastered version. <br /> <br />Liar:  10/10 <br />A very underrated Megadeth song.  The lyrics are about Chris Poland, former Megadeth 2nd guitarist, and are very clever, and crude as well! <br /> <br />Hook in Mouth:  9/10 <br />Dave voice on this song is different than any other song on the album, raspier in a way.  I'm not sure if that was intentional or not.  Anyway, some of Daves most clever lyrics are present, like when he spells \\"FREEDOM\\" and also attacks the PMRC with the clever metaphor of a hook in mouth.  This song was also written around the time that Dave left Metallica.  <br /> <br />TOTAL:  76/80 = 5 stars <br /> <br />Overall, I think that this album as a very raw feel that no other megadeth album has.  Some songs are rawer than others, of course, but together they make up one of the best albums in the Megadeth catalogue.  Definately pick this one up, even if you have the original!
B000286S8S|5.0|I thought that this Van Halen album was smartly compiled and done.  Though not in chronological order, they blended the songs to how they sound back to back.  I have played this on and off the past 5 weeks since I bought it (the day it was released on July 20, 2004 at a Wal-Mart) while on vacation in Amarillo, Texas during a road trip out west.  The 1978-1983 songs with Roth balance well with the '80s/'90s hits by Sammy Hagar.  The live songs fit well with this album. I still love Panama and its crunchy, fast, big over the top sound! I liked the three new songs that followed Eruption. And I like that Mike Shipley got to record with VH on the mixing part--he's one of my favorites! so Most purists would not agree with this decision, but they're Van Halen and they do what they want!  Fine, rocking collection--get 10, 20, maybe 30 copies of it to send to your friends and comrades!!!!!!
B000069HKH|1.0|This song attempts to capitalize on the wave of patriotism sweeping the country (another one; groan) but fails with this collection of forgettable tunes. Unlike previous albums such as \\"Born in the USA\\", this work has no memorable tunes that fans will tap their toes to and sing along with. A big disappointment.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|First let me say : Bill Murray rules in this movie, and it really is a good, warm and quiet 99 minutes \\"piece\\" - I just watched it. It's definetively in the league of \\"As good as it gets\\" (Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt) though not quite as good perhaps. These kind of movies are all about acting, and not about effects at all.  <br /> <br />\\"Lost in translation\\" is a simple story, but different. It's a love-story without the usual Hollywood-score and drama there to spice it up. But at the end of the movie you still are able to feel with the young married girl and the aged actor as they struggle to find the right words to say good-bye. It's the \\"dark\\" Notting Hill, though these movies shouldn't be compared to eachother. <br /> <br />I personally find \\"Lost in translation\\" as a very funny movie  as well, just the expression on Bill Murrays' face makes me laugh when there is something happening in the movie his character finds hopeless or weird. The man has a funny face! It's not a comedy, but I feel good after watching it. There is a strange humour in it, and I actually also find Tokyo-english a lot of fun. <br /> <br />As mentioned, these kinds of movies are all about acting. And the two main actors here has done a great job I think. Bill Murray as always is brilliant, put Bruce Willis in his role instead and the movie would be a disaster. But it's not. <br /> <br />Though it's a simple story being told here I admire Coppola for her script and talent behind the whole thing, this movie belongs in my DVD-collection - and I absolutely do not regret I bought it.  <br /> <br />So if you like down-to-earth-movies between the great epics standing in lines these days, and if you're a fan of Bill Murray don't hesitate to watch this one. I know the reviewers here either love or hate \\"Lost in translation\\", but it deserves a chanse at least. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001DI0FI|2.0|Well, this was a shock : It's the most less-entertaining and boring movie I've seen in years when it comes to at least average expectations for entertainment. And I really mean BORING!  <br /> <br />I like Russell Crowe and many of the other actors as well, but something didn't feel right here. I got the feeling while watching it that they didn't have much faith in the project either. The acting was nothing more than ok. <br /> <br />Two stars for the great ships feautering in \\"Master and commander\\", they're beautiful. <br /> <br />The movie starts out with a battle between these two ships, a real kick-start one could say - but then the movie gets tooooo looooong, and the story never gripped me at all.  <br /> <br />I find the hunt for the \\"mysterious\\" ship quite unrealistic as well, it can't be a true story can it? <br /> <br />Giving the expression \\"...a small world\\" a whole new meaning while these two ships keep \\"crashing\\" into eachother across the ocean time after time as if they're the only two ships in the world fighting the war out there. No sir! <br /> <br />I usually like this kind of movie, but \\"Master and commander\\" was a bad surprise.
0195073401|5.0|I have read three graduate level Microeconomic Thoery texts: Mas-Colell, et al. Microeconomic Theory, Varian's Microeconomic Analysis, and Krep's A Course in Microeconomic Theory.<br /><br />Mas-Colell is generally the most detailed, inclusive book that must be on the shelf of any serious economist. It has its weak points; however, it is the best that there is for learning the basics of microeconomic theory. Note that this book is generally the text of choice for the first year of graduate study at most all of the top econ programs.<br /><br />The math requirements for getting the most out of this book are fairly heavy. With out a good math for economists course, this book is very difficult to use.<br /><br />Kreps book takes on more of the game theory approach. This is very interesting for the game/decision theorist, and is a highly recommended in addition to Mas-Colell for those with these interests.<br /><br />Varian is often used in masters degree level graduate programs, and lower-level phd programs. At Cornell, Varian covered most of the information from the first semester of microeconomics, but provided virtually no help after that.<br /><br />It is not as intense as Mas-Colell. However, it is often very helpful in its own right. For students who are using Mas-Colell in their courses, but are struggling to grasp all of the concepts, Varian presents the information in a more \\"user-friendly\\" way. He spends more time explaining the concepts using english rather than math, which can be very helpful to someone just starting out.<br /><br />Additionally, I found the practice problems and examples in Varian very helpful when studying for exams.<br /><br />In summary, all serious economists usually have Mas-Colell. Other than that, choose your additional books based on your needs and interests.
B0000V46Q8|2.0|There were aspects to like about this film, but the overall package was not appealing.  Based upon the video jacket, I expected some suspense, a good deal of science fiction stuff, and yes, some action.  Instead, I fed on haunting music, pretty outerspace scenery, and very slow motion story that could be summarized:  Love that ends tragically, when redone, ends up being sadly undone. <br /> <br />The main character, played by Clooney, is a psychologist, mourning the suicide death of his lover.  He goes to Solaris, a space station, to find out why the crew has been out of communication.  When he arrives, he quickly succumbs to the seduction of the Solaris system...and we spend the rest of the story agonizing with Clooney over whether what once was might--even if in shadows--can be recaptured. <br /> <br />This might have been a great story, an intriguing novel...but on film, it came across as a dark, milingering attempt at visual poetry-science fiction.  It was an awkward mix that did not work for me. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  Stick with science fiction or love tragedies...don't subject yourself to this failed mix--unless you also like ketchup on your ice cream.

B00005JLTM|4.0|I watched this film a few years after Matrix, so the connections came a bit rustily for me.  Nevertheless, Matrix Reloaded was viewable, even as a stand alone.  It offered plenty of action, a decent plot, some mind boggling notions to wrestle with, and the visual effects were interesting and stimulating. <br /> <br />For those, like me, who still think of Star Trek, when we consider science fiction, Matrix Reloaded is going to to have a ragged tempo--a little too much of an MTV feel.  Yet, it works.  I enjoyed the story and happenings, in spite of the film clearly being geared for a younger audience.  Furthermore, the fact that spirituality--even Calvinism--could be addressed in such a production is truly impressive. <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  If you can track with the drive of MTV-like music and tempo, and enjoy science fiction with heavy doses of philosophy and martial arts, this movie will prove a winner.  Watching Matrix first may help, but is not necessary to grasp the plot.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Jane Austen film adaptation to date. As a mini series filmed in six installments (but as been put only onto two DVD discs), it is able to stay incredibly faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice. The plot and dialogue stay so close to Austen's novel and the characterizations are right on the mark. <br /> <br />Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are positively magical in their roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Ehle brings the wit and independent nature of Elizabeth to life and Firth adds the proud, forebooding nature to Mr. Darcy. Other supporting actors do a marvalous job in bringing the other classic characters of Pride and Prejudice to life. The actors who play the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the conscending nature of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham are all faithful to their written characters. <br /> <br />A wonderful visual portrait of nineteenth century England and high society. The cinematography, costumes and sets bring the entire \\"gentleman's\\" world to life.  <br /> <br />A most definite must-see!!! I guarantee you will be watching the entire mini series in one sitting! It's impossible not to! (And don't forget to read the book!)
0452282152|4.0|I recently discovered this author through a recommendation in a women's magazine.  I very much have enjoyed three of her books, this being the third one I read.  It is an enjoyable read, yet very strange in contrast to modern day standards of \\"appropriate behavior\\".  I found it interesting and fun, and was pleased there was not the disturbing events found in \\"Virgin Blue\\".   <br /> <br />The movie does not do the book justice and is actually slow (I'm sure I wouldn't have finished it had I not already read the book).   <br /> <br />
B0000630YA|5.0|This album is amazing. I love all the songs on this album. If you like Alice Cooper you should definitly get this album.I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B000002AGN|5.0|The other day, I was in a car for an extended period with a relative who is not much into jazz. I put this CD in and two remarkable things happened. First, she recognized EVERY ONE of the 7 tracks on the CD, and second, she told me that she could easily detect the time signatures and signature changes in these tracks. Yet another testamant to Dave Brubeck and his quartet's uncanny ability to take what could have been an esoteric concept (odd time signature jazz) and make it accessible, fun, and still remarkably swinging! <br /> <br />For those who are not quite drawn to jazz or are eager novices, this is a great CD to get for its accessibility and catchiness (another is Miles Davis's \\"Kind of Blue\\"). For those who are in the know about jazz, this is STILL a great CD to get for its uniqueness and polished musicianshilp that is always present, it seems, in the combo of Brubeck, Desmond, Wright, and Morello.  <br /> <br />So how is it possile for a CD to be simultaneously unique and innovative while being listenable and commercially viable? I couldn't tell you and most claiming they could are probably only guessing, too. But I CAN tell you that the seven songs here achieve it. For all who thought either (a) that jazz is an intellectual thing that might be intellectually interesting but far from enjoyable listening, or; (b) that any jazz that is listenable or commercially viable must sacrifice some level of originality or depth; - both groups will be amply proved wrong.  <br /> <br />Bravo, Dave!

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Basically this movie is about a young man who gets the chance to go on tour and write about an up-and-coming rock band for \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine.  Loosely based on the director, Cameron Crowe's life.        <br /> <br /> I am an 18 year old girl who loves the 1960's-1970's and appreciates the movies, clothes and especially music of that era. However for me it was incredibly difficult to find a movie made very well of the rock music scene until i rented \\"Almost Famous.\\" From the beginning of the movie with the main actor Patrick Fugit writing the credits on a piece of notebook paper, to Kate Hudson's Oscar deserving performance, you are taken by this movie, at least I am.  <br />    This movie is appealing (at least to me) because its about a young man who travels with a band and experiences it all. It's literally a dream come true for most people. Who hasn't wanted to travel with their favorite band and learn all their secrets and how they were inspired to write each of their songs? I certainly would love to know what makes Pete Townshend write the songs he does, because he is one of the greatest lyricist's alive. <br />     This movie is timeless. You will laugh and love & appreicate all the characters you come across in this movie. With amazing performances by Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Patrick Fugit and Zooey Deschanel I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie. It certainly is the best movie of 2000. If you don't watch the movie for the performances and the plot, just watch it because it has the one of the best movie soundtracks out there.
B0002858YS|4.0|From some of the reviews below it would appear that pop music has become a dirty word - or two! The Killers may not have the sense of importance of Interpol (who actually steal quite liberally from Joy Division), and sure, they appear to be complete musical kleptomaniacs but in a sense it does not matter if the ideas are put together to create a new whole. So whilst the band wears its influences on it's collective sleeve there is no denying the rush of sheer, grin causing pleasure I experienced on hearing \\"Mr. Brightside\\" or \\"Jenny\\". The band does seem to run out of ideas by the end of the album though which is a shame. At least 5 of the tracks however are near perfect pop music, in all it's cheap, disposable glory, and although this album may not stay on your player for years to come I've found it to be the perfect summer companion.
B00005MP58|5.0|In previous years every time this aired on A & E the TV became mine and woe to anyone who tried to change the channel! So you can imagine how thrilled I was to receive this for my birthday. I have no complaints with my copy in regards to color, it seems fine to me. The one minor thing I wish it had was the closed captioning, simply because my children tend to get a bit loud at times. Perhaps I need to watch it again while they're at school. Then I can moon over Mr. Darcy/Colin Firth in peace!
0765301598|2.0|I have to say that I am disapointed with they way this book was written. This second set of prequels was not worth the effort. I can only hope a better job is done with the next book.
630469878X|4.0|What starts out as a weekend fishing trip soon turns into something much different for friends Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon).  Thelma agrees to go away for a long weekend in the mountains with Louise, but only after giving her over-bearing husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald) the slip.  After driving for a while, the girls stop at a roadside nightclub.  Here, Thelma is hit upon by Harlan, a scummy local who tries to attract as many women as he can.  After several drinks, Thelma begins to feel sick and decides to go outside.  Harlan follows her and tries to force himself on her, but Louise and her trusty .38 intervene on Thelma's behalf. <br /> <br />What happens next is a cross-country flight across the American Southwest with Hal, (Harvey Keitel) , a determined detective, hot on their trail.  Along the way, The girls meet J.D. played by a young Brad Pitt.  He claims to be a student hitch-hiking his way back to school, but in reality, he is a convicted thief on parole.  Thelma, suffering from lack of attention in her marriage, soon falls for J.D., but J.D. is only interested in the $6,700 dollars that Louise's boyfriend Jimmy had sent to her by Western Union.  Soon, the girls are left without any money and are forced to turn to thievery to survive.   <br /> <br />I thought this was a very good film.  Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are teriffic in their roles, and Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel give good performances as well.  There are some good scenes in the movie, such as the gas truck exploding after being shot by Louise, and the State Trooper sequence is funny as well. <br />I recommend this film.  It is funny and exciting at the same time and will keep you glued to your screen throughout.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Aside from the obligatory sex scenes, this movie had few redeeming qualities.  There was no plot, and the director's probably laughing at all the people who claim to have found one.  I've watched this movie twice.  The second time was with someone who claimed that they \\"got it\\".  I could see the symbolism, but why go to that much trouble to hide a story?

0553579908|5.0|WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />On technical merit along, Kings is even better than Thrones and people who enjoyed the first will undoubtedly enjoy the second. There are so very few great fantasy series-we admit this-that anyone who sneers at fantasy as the poor second cousin to sci-fi should pick the series up and see what it has to offer. People who love to read fanciful thrillers in mainstream fiction like Grisham, Stephen King, Robin Cook, or Michael Crichton will, we think, find A Song of Ice and Fire very much to their liking. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Readers upset with bloodshed, sex, and profanity in the first book are in for a double-helping of the same in Kings. Avoid if that's a problem for you. Readers that are incorrigibly high-minded or are looking to stretch their philosophical muscles will be disappointed this book. Your better bet is Years of Rice and Salt or The Scar. Perhaps even CS Lewis' Space Trilogy. If you feel like good has to win in the end and you will be severely disappointed if it doesn't, you can expand your horizons with this book and suffer an existential crisis or else pass and live with your illusions.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Absolutely, BUY THIS FILM.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ANY TYPE EVER MADE.     Disney, after originally having scheduled the release of this masterpiece for August 31, having moved it to Feb. 22, and having taken it off the release list, has now reinstated its release on Feb. 22.  It will be released with Porco Rosso and The Cat Returns; originally, it was to be released with My Neighbor Totoro, but The Cat has been substituted.  This is mistifying, because Cat is a sequel to Whisper from the Heart, a sweet and endearing film that has never been released in the U.S.; a studio does not usually release the sequel first. What is Disney thinking, and what is to be done with Totoro?    That said, Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind was Miyazaki's first full-length original film (I don't count the Lupin films because they're part of someone else's work), and it is utterly superb.  It is adapted from the epic manga series that he created in between projects while working for other directors, and only covers about 30% of the enormous story.  It has a heavy ecological message, and shows Miyazaki's trademark fascination with flight and unusual animals.  The story is deep, rich, emotional, and satisfying.  The soundtrack, Jo Hisashi's first for Miyazaki, is one of his best; it is not extremely varied, but it is rich and emotional.    A version of this film was introduced as Warriors of the Wind in the late 1980's in the U.S.  While the dub was excellent, twenty minutes of cuts made in the film infuriated Miyazaki to the point where he refused to allow any more U.S. sales of his films until Disney agreed to release the films uncut and to do their prodigious best with the vocal talents for the dubs.  I still do not feel that their choice of voice actors has always been the best; some of the performances in Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke were at best lackluster, but there's always the subtitles and original Japanese soundtrack for purists who aren't happy with the results.    This film is an absolute must-have for any animation fan.  Even being Miyazaki's first film, it is a detailed, mature work far beyond the scope of most animation directors and storytellers.  I just hope that Amazon will release this film in a 3-pack with Porco Rosso and The Cat Returns.
0553573403|5.0|WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:<br /><br />Any reader that enjoys exploring a fully invented world and/or finds great pleasure in medieval romances and historical works exploring that period will find continuing and unshakable delight in this book. Additionally, anyone who is chilled by predestination and fate will be obsessive about reading this book; it is foreordination in one the most compelling forms we have ever read. It's enjoyed great acclaim among devotees of the fantasy genre but--unlike Jordan, Goodkind, Eddings and Brooks--Martin fully deserves the praise for his perfect craftsmanship of the world he has created. For readers very suspicious of the fantasy genre being able to produce anything of note, this is an excellent introduction for it acknowledges the fact that there is a lot more to be had in books then \\"Get the sword,\\" \\"Save the Girl,\\" and \\"Kill the monster.\\"<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:<br /><br />The book does not have happy endings in its many subplots. Justice does not often prevail. The weak are not often saved by the just. There is course language-though never seeming out of place. There is violence. This is not a book that should be read to children. It is most definitely R-rated material. Also, if there is any flaw to the writing, it is in that there is little self-reflection or introspection in the characters and also little or no philosophy to the Seven Kingdoms. If this is the reason you read then you would be better served by Gene Wolfe or perhaps Kim Stanley Robinson.<br /><br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I am a fanatic for the works of Miyazaki, and this is my favorite among his works.  There is no heavy-handed message other than his dislike of Fascism; there are no cute or bizarre animals other than the hero, and cute is just not the word for him; there are adventure, derring-do, light-hearted fight scenes, strong female figures, comic villains, romance, great achievements, a touch of magic, and the typically fanatical Miyazaki attention to detail.  This is an atypical light adventure film and is suitable for children from 9 to 99.  It's charming, fun, and simply wonderful.  Please, buy it.    I can only hope that Amazon will package this in a 3-pack with Nausicaa in the Valley of Wind and My Neighbor Totoro, all due (actually LONG overdue) for simultaneous release.  (The official date of release is now Feb. 22, and it will be released with Nausicaa and The Cat Returns; Totoro is not currently scheduled.  This is mistifying, as The Cat Returns is actually a sequel to another Ghibli [but not Miyazaki] film that has never been released in the U.S.)
0393316041|5.0|Science Digest is quoted on the cover as saying:  <br /> <br />One of the most famous science books of our time, the phenomenal national bestseller that, \\"buzzes with energy, anecdote and life. It almost makes you want to become a physicist.\\" <br /> <br />Compare with the Chicago Sun Times quoted on the first page announcing, \\"Hilarious, exhilarating...\\" and the Detroit Free Press echoing, \\"If a single book can shatter the stereotype of the stuffy scientist, this may be the one.\\" <br /> <br />Now, the first publication is a science magazine of some good reputation who caters to people who could charitably be called \\"eggheads.\\" The fact that these people consider something funny is one thing but the fact that the mainstream press can consider the same book funny when the only science they've whiffed in the last 3 decades of their lives is from the general university requirement they barely passed as a freshman on their way to get some kind of liberal arts degree.  <br /> <br />Now consider that this book is a national bestseller many times over, has spawned multiple editions and re-printings, and a variety of sequels--one can only assume that Feynman has touched a chord in the mainstream population as well (at least the book-reading mainstream population).  <br /> <br />What can this possibly mean to the business reader?  <br /> <br />Two things.  <br /> <br />First, that it is possible for really smart people working in extremely esoteric fields to have a profound effect on an astonishingly broad cross-section of people. This is very important to any executive who is 1) probably far more educated than the majority of people in his industry, 2) can seem very forbidding due to his rank in the company, and 3) who is constantly challenged with trying to figure out how to motivate the office proletariat that is in truth the heart and soul of any company.  <br /> <br />Just look at the shelves in any business section in any bookstore and you see all kinds of those weird books with numbered laws blaring out anecdotes that are really some sort of pacifying opiate to placate the rebellious and discontented who dwell in cubicles. And as the anecdote goes, if any of these books had the real answer would there be so many of them?  <br /> <br />That leads us to the second point: what this book is about is LIFE. It is about a person who is going about living exactly the kind of LIFE that everyone wishes in their head to lead. But he does it. And best, by his LIVING he positively affects those around him in to living as well. Now, the business books try and talk about business but what better way to motivate people than by talking about their LIFE? <br /> <br />Not only is this a lesson in motivation through example and action for any executive but it is also a guidebook about how the executive should go forth in his career. Feynman very casually shatters notions of immutable laws in society and business. He tramples over social mores and niceties like an elephant in a flower garden. He blithely breaks procedural laws and office political codes with the same aplomb that he creates new laws in quantum mechanics out of the ashes of standard particle physics.  <br /> <br /> <br />Feynman is a model for the business executive who feels trapped by politics, by procedures, or by industry. He will teach you how to perceive your job and place in the world in such a way that you'll either change your job or change jobs--change your company or change the industry. For all the weirdo business books that strive to tell you how to keep objectives, higher level goals, and mission statements in mind it is a physicist--Feynman--that shows you how to do it. And makes you laugh along the way.  <br /> <br />All in a 346 page book that you can probably finish on a plane flight to one of those stupid summit meetings in Chicago or some other metropolis.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM

B000002LQR|4.0|Whether you view this album as the end of their early years, or the start of their later years, either way it's their best one. Though I actually like the two albums before it more, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" is the longest, most diverse, and overall greatest of their releases. It's the album that's the perfect match of their young/fun energy, and their more maturing song writing skills. Besides including their breakthrough to the masses hit \\"Under The Bridge\\", it also has \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Breaking The Girl\\", and \\"Suck My Kiss\\". Plus my personal faves \\"Power Of Equality\\", \\"BSSM\\", and the excellent \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\", which is one of my top 3 \\"Chili Peppers\\" songs ever. Even though they have recently mellowed some, this 1991 album still funking rocks!
0385512104|5.0|This novel is about Christopher, a young boy who is highly intelligent and profoundly autistic; he opines on the mysteries of the universe but is tragically unable to understand the emotions roiling around him as his parents' marriage dissolves.  What begins as a murder mystery becomes instead a touching portrait of a family's hardships as observed by the person most uniquely unable to handle them.  Author Haddon's deft touch makes this work.  The book could easily have become sentimental tripe but it never does.  This is a lovely and thought-provoking book.  I'm very glad I read it, have recommended it to others, and will undoubtedly re-read it again some time.
0451169514|5.0|This Stephen King novel, at over 1300 pages long, is by no means a quick and easy read. Those who want to enjoy this have to have the required time and devotion put by for it, but it doesn't half feel like a rewarding experience. An empty holiday at home can be spent lost in another one of King's universes, with his brilliantly developed characters for company. <br /> <br />As usual, the action takes place in Derry, Maine. Seven children are brought together by a series of events and become friends. All of them bullied at school and seen as social rejects, they dub themselves 'the losers club'. After sharing their experiences with each other, they discover that there is something sinister going on in Derry, something that only the children can see, something that terrorises the young and feeds off fear... and they realise that their coming together may have been more than just chance... <br /> <br />Despite the great number of characters (7 main characters as children and adults, plus many other important people who are integral to the story) King makes you feel and care for every single one of them. He uses a technique whereby all 7 of the main characters are individualy weak, but together they are infinatly stronger. This feeling is burning off the pages, and gives the reader a definate sense of security when they are together and a tense, uneasy feeling when they are alone. This is one of King's most terrifying books, as he pummels you with one horror sequance after another, each more terrifying than the last. Not only does the fantasy horror element give the reader a disturbing feeling of unreality, there is also a human factor to the horror provided by the pychotic bully, who gives just as many horrifying sequances as the monster itself. You're extreemly scared yet irresistably compelled. Things get more disturbing as things go on until the brilliantly climatic (and slightly confusing, it has to be said) finale gives you a completely out-of-this-world experience.  <br /> <br />Though King's idea of giving the leader of the losers club a stutter is very clever (he doesn't waste a single opportunity to exploit it in some intelligent way) it does make for slightly tiring reading sometimes. Nothing serious enough to destroy your enjoyment of the book, but enough to occaisionly get on your n-n-n-n-nerves. That's the only complaint i can think of with this otherwise perfect book. Now go and find yourself a spare month and take yourself on a journey that's so terrifying you won't want to look back.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Anyone who wants to call this propaganda is a fool.  If you want to sit here and whine how all this does is bash Bush, how it doesn't address the mistakes of other presidents blah blah blah. The bottom line is, these former presidents aren't up for re-election.  If I'm at work, and I make a mistake, a huge financial mistake, like say...miscalculating liabilities of 50 billion dollars which turn out to be 150 billion, I'm getting fired.  Lets not stray from the facts.  This 150 billion dollar mistake has destroyed families, ruined lives, lowered our country's reputation worldwide and cost lives(which there can never be a pricetag placed on).  I'm getting fired.  At any other job on this planet, a monetary mistake of this magnitude alone would have me thrown out of my job so fast...Why should the presidency be any different?  Let the next guy in line have his shot.  It can't be any worse that the guy who has already screwed up so royally.  If republicans want someone in the whitehouse, they should be nominating a different candidate at the RNC.  Footage doesn't lie.  He did these things.  He said these things.  George Bush, YOU'RE FIRED.
0321213351|5.0|This book goes much further than Martin Fowler's seminal work on refactoring. Indeed, it goes further than the GoF's canonical work on patterns. By combining the two, Kerievsky breaks new ground.<br /><br />The refactorings are accessible and beautifully presented. As with the GoF book, a lot of the rationale will ring a bell. &#34;Gee, I've seen this before...&#34; The value of these refactorings lie precisely in that corner, where the mechanics of refactoring with a GoF pattern as the goal allow one to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.<br /><br />Some of the refactorings were less than obvious to me until I read this book. And that's where Kerievsky's mastery shows. He presents fresh ideas (to me, anyway) with solid examples, and thoroughly thought-out steps.<br /><br />The examples deserve special mention. How many times have you read a &#34;manual&#34; or other technical how-to with toy examples that fail to illustrate the point? Or with examples so narrow that they hardly approach your real-world situation. (I could name names... ;-&#62;) OTOH, how many examples are so long and laborious, that gleaning any useful information requires learning the author's example-problem domain before you can get anywhere?<br /><br />Kerievsky walks the tightrope between toy examples and over-engineered examples with tremendous skill. They're Goldilocks examples: Neither too big, nor too small, his examples are juuust right.<br /><br />Another area in which some tightrope walking is required is presenting material that's suitable for a tutorial, vs. material that makes for easy access as a reference. Josh somehow manages to balance the two. Reading from begining to end, one is able to appreciate the tutorial nature of the material. However, (like Fowler's Refactoring) easy look-up is made possible by the formal presentation of each refactoring.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone who cares about Software Craftsmanship (my plug for Pete McBreen's book too!)<br /><br />Disclaimer: This review is based on a prepublication manuscript.s based on a prepublication manuscript.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Like Project co-founder Eric Woolfson's recent musical effort, Poe, comparing Alan's album to previous material is comparing apples and oranges.  If you're looking for something that reminds you of the glory days of the Project, this album is not for you. <br /> <br />However, if you've often wondered about the electronica musical genre, this album is a great introduction.  Why?  Because it showcases a broad display of electronica styles, not just one.  And that's good because chances are, you probably won't like *all* styles and if the entire album happened to be one you didn't like.....you wouldn't like the album. <br /> <br />Instead, Alan has worked with a number of electronica artists as well as his son Jeremy, to produce a great overview of the form.  There's also a little blast from the past in that David Gilmour makes a great guitar contribution in three sections on the first track, Return To Tunguska.  At first, I felt the song suffered from \\"NMG\\" (Needs More Gilmour) but then I wondered just where else his material would fit in well.....and it wouldn't.  It's not unlike the Project days where many always felt each album suffered from \\"NMB\\" (Needs More Bairnson--the Project's long time and world great guitar player Ian Bairnson).  And yet, when you're done listening to it, you'll think \\"yeah, that's exactly what was needed, not much more\\". <br /> <br />\\"More Lost Without You\\" probably stands out for being the least electronica of the material and features the vocal skills of PJ Olsson.  This song is much more of a straight forward alternative rock, almost pop song but there's an very interesting beat and background sounds that will take repeated listens to pick up. <br /> <br />Mammagamma 04 is a remake of an old Project song and should see lots of use on the dance floor.  Superb adaptation of an old instrumental for the dance/trance genre. <br /> <br />We Play The Game features Alan on vocals, although you need to listen carefully to figure out it's him.This song might come close, in parts, to some of Alan's work in the Project or his \\"solo\\" work with 90s collaborators Bairnson and Stuart Elliot.  But it's another song with an intricate beat and driving rythm that takes a while to get started but then really takes off.  Alan uses another guitar player with style elements that old Project fans will recognize but that doesn't get in the way of the underlying electronica. <br /> <br />Tijuaniac, you'll either love it or hate it.  That's because it veers into a modern jazz feel that other reviewers compare to some of Rick Wright's (Pink Floyd) solo work or early 90s Jean Michel-Jarre's material.  It's a lilting, slow-paced song but then about halfway thru, goes in this completely unexpected jazz direction.  Again, you'll love it or hate it. <br /> <br />L'arc En Ciel has another driving beat with numerous elements added overtop bit by bit.  It's a good example of how Alan's oh so good at taking seeming disparate beats, integrating them and coming up with something that sounds incredible.  He also uses a sound that simulates the old \\"vox\\" (from 50s sci fi movies) and uses it as a synth in some ways. <br /> <br />Reoccuring Dream has more keyboards up front and less of an overall electronica sound than even \\"More Lost Without You\\".  Alan uses a sort of polyrythmic beat, then a synth, then a processed vocal that simulates the old vocoder to recreate this Project song.  It's not fast but is much more of a paced song and you'll recognize the bass line. <br /> <br />You Can Run features David Pack on vocals although you'd never know it.  This isn't Ambrosia or ballad rock, it's quite rockin' with a drum beat that's fairly straightforward but heavily \\"trashy\\" (using things like crash and splash cymbals that sound like banging sticks on garbage can lids).  It's a neat effect and creates a song that's very accesible by rock fans with the usual (by now) electronica elements providing the backdrop. <br /> <br />Chomolungma startsoff slow with a slow beat and all kinds of vocal bits, background noises, etc., playing around with each other.  But is slowly builds in terms of pace and layers and volume (there's some howling dogs in the background that are haunting).  There are even some chants in spots, very bass or baritone in nature.  There's a lot going on in this song in the periphery.  Then the horns kick in toward the end and along with the beat, the chanting and the orchestration, you literally are surrounded with music.  Then wham, it stops on a dime and John Cleese makes his guest appearance. <br /> <br />This is a very good effort from Alan and shows that he can adapt his natural talents in terms of instrumental composition, beat and rythm constructs and studio expertise into making something very contemporary, polished and accessible, hopefully to those familiar with his old work and new folks looking for a great introduction to electronica.
B00000583F|5.0|This record is basically a 52-minute, druggy homage to Black Sabbath with massive fuzz guitars and lyrics that record all sorts of psychedelic hallucinations. There's not much else to say about it. The singing is not that great but then there isn't much of it either. Stoner or doom rock fans who like the early Sabbath sound will probably dig this. Anyone else probably won't get it. Although it's in vaguely the same genre as Kyuss' \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" and Monster Magnet's \\"Spine of God\\", I'd have to say that \\"Holy Mountain\\" goes further in terms of sheer heaviness and drugged-out lunacy. Not a terribly original disc, but well done.

My mom handed my Flylady's book and it's been getting better and better.  I get the reminders everyday online, but when I start feeling unmotivated I reread her book.

B00005JN2F|5.0|My only problem with the two Bourne movies has been that they seem to be too short and scream for sequels.  Matt Damon is excellent and convincing as the cool Jason Bourne, trained by a covert government agency as the ultimate assassin.   <br /> <br />Jason has retired with his girlfriend from the first movie and is leading a quiet life in India.  All of a sudden there is a bombing to cover up some covert crime and the bombers have placed Jason Bourne's fingerprint at the scene.  To make the frame-up complete with no witnesses, an assassin is dispatched to take care of Bourne in India.  Of course the assassin fails but kills Bourne's girlfriend in the chase that ensues.  Thus Bourne again (as in the first movie) forced to deal with people who are trying to kill him, that he has no memory of. <br /> <br />Meanwhile a European CIA operative (played brilliantly by Joan Allen) starts investigating Jason Bourne's classified records and starts to ask questions about Treadstone, which brings the remaining characters from the first movie into the fray.  The CIA head that tried to bury the Treadstone project keeps warning Allen that you don't know what you're getting yourself into. <br /> <br />Little by little Bourne starts to find out some things about those who are after him until he can turn the tables against them.  Julia Styles is excellent in her small role and could have been used more.   <br /> <br />The action and the car chases in this movie are equal to the best films around!  Damon's Bourne is one of the best government agent characters I have seen in any film. <br /> <br />It definitely helps to see the first movie prior to seeing this. (also, excellent).  I saw it a few days after on cable and then saw this movie a second time and was able to more readily follow the plot.
006016848X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it truly does help you overcome communication blocks between the sexes. It is put in a simple, fun, easy-to-read way that doesn't attack either sex for behaving certain ways. This is a great book for a couple to read together.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|As a fan of romantic comedies, a recurring viewer of MOONSTRUCK and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, I have an admitted soft spot for these kinds of movies. I wasn't repelled by NOTTING HILL, but mostly I love the old screwball comedies of the Thirties along with the elegant romances of that era. <br /> <br />So I'm not being casual, or mere stick-in-the-mud, when I say that LOVE ACTUALLY is one of the worst movies ever made, was insulting, and by its end was physically painful to watch. I literally demanded to my friend that we leave the theatre, and felt a blessed relief after escaping the unceasing sequence of the boy running through Heathrow Airport as swells of glottal muzak was ejaculated from the sound system. <br /> <br />While I've survived Heathrow, and understand how running through it would be a mighty undertaking in the best of circumstances, that doesn't mean we need to be subjected to it, and be expected to find it cute and sweet. In this era of terrorism, children running pell-mell through major airports is not a cause for romantic delight. And the movie's near pathological stereotypes of Americans (e.g. hyper-sexed Texan co-eds in small-town Wisconsin winter?) were just plain weird. The writer obviously takes his Playboy \\"Girls of the SEC\\" issue a bit too seriously. <br /> <br />Basically, hack writer/director Richard Curtis seems to have believed he found the perfect formula for the greatest romantic love story of all time. Take every possible romantic plot (tragic loss, young infatuation, mature reconciliation, tantalizing sexuality, shy office relationships, chance encounter, ironic circumstance, illness, naughty infidelity, deeply complex obsession, etc., etc.), mash it all into one over-wrought pandering concoction, simplify each relationship to the barest cliche possible, inject routine amusing coincidences, overdose on a slushy soundtrack, and after a two+ hour stewing you get a small pink paper package filled with Nutrasweet artifical sweetener. That is LOVE ACTUALLY for you. <br /> <br />And pandering is the real key here. Pandering not of the highest order, but of the lowest common denominator, as every possible consitutency that can be pandered to IS pandered to by this movie. Begin character sequence, touch on the most banal emotional trigger possible, cut to the next sequence, touch on the most banal emotional trigger possible, cut to the next......repeat cycle to infinity. This is the entirety of the movie.  <br /> <br />Thus, despite actually having some of the best British film stars (and a few excellent actual American film stars), doing some actually very good acting, there is no way they can save this movie from being what it ACTUALLY is: utter crap. You might as well mainline corn syrup into your aortal vein for all of the \\"emotional\\" truths supposedly danced before our eyes.  <br /> <br />If life and love could be reduced to a series of predictable, superficial and cliched episodes--a grand Hallmark card--it certainly wouldn't be worth making a movie about, now would it?
B0002IQMKM|4.0|Talking Heads interest seems to be rebounding lately, with the four disc box set earlier this year, the long awaited release of the out of print \\"The Name Of This Band is Talking Heads\\" live CD, plus plans for reissuing remastered versions of the band's back catalog sometime in 2005. I'm excited about that. After all, the \\"Talking Heads '77\\" \\"Psycho Killer\\" was one of the first of the NYC/CBGB's gang to chart a single, and \\"Take Me To The River\\" snuck into the Top 40, introducing Talking Heads to the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" AND \\"American Bandstand\\" crowd.<br /><br />The influence of Talking Heads simply cannot be overstated. These four art school neurotics developed a style that mixed the nervous energy of punk (\\"Psycho Killer\\") with bubblegum pop (\\"Uh Oh, Love Comes to Town\\") and waspy soul. The ironically titled \\"Fear Of Music\\" album saw the creative resources gel for remarkable power (\\"Life During Wartime\\"), the soulful enough to get Simply Red to cover it \\"Heaven\\", and Eno's arty injections making him a key element in the band's sound (\\"Memories Can't Wait\\") and an invisible fifth member. But it was Eno's forceful presence and Byrne's artistic restlessness that, by their still remarkable \\"Remain In Light,\\" Talking Heads were turning the whole insular art rock world on its ear with polyrythmic productions (both the single and ground breaking video for \\"Once In A Lifetime\\") that remains influential even now.<br /><br />Once they got a big dose of artiness out of the way, Talking Heads released their breeziest album to date, \\"Speaking In Tongues.\\" It gave the Heads their lone American Top 10 in \\"Burning Down The House.\\" By then, David Byrne was beginning to overshadow the band (Tom Tom Club side project being the exception) and it was getting obvious that the Heads were becoming volatile. Still, there was one more great album in the loose and poppy \\"Little Creatures,\\" then the odd film, \\"True Stories,\\" before the burn really hit.<br /><br />Byrne was looking at the band as creative sidemen by now (this was when TIME magazine had given him a cover story as a \\"Rock and Roll Renaissance Man\\"). The next album, \\"Naked,\\" was as far from the band's New York roots as the South American music Byrne was then exploring could get. Even long term fans began to wonder what was going on, and the singles from \\"Naked\\" pretty much failed to connect. Rather quietly, the band went on hiatus. But in retrospect, \\"Naked's\\" initial offering \\"Nothing But Flowers\\" is a wickedly funny song that laments losing the war with progress to cornfields that \\"used to be a 7/11.\\"<br /><br />You'll find plenty to like about this single disc set, even if you're only marginally aware of the Talking Heads' impact. Their video output from \\"Remain In Light\\" on was as cutting edge as the genre went at the time. Which leads me to quibble number one: the terrific and funny vid for \\"True Stories'\\" \\"Love For Sale,\\" which found the band being turned into candy bars and other consumer durables, made that song into a near hit. It's omission levels my rating by a star, as it could've easily replaced \\"Blind.\\" (While I am sure there will plenty that complain about no tracks from \\"Stop Making Sense,\\" I'm OK with that.)<br /><br />And that leads me to quibble number two: Where's the DVD? \\"Storytelling Giant\\" deserves better than to be imprisoned in the pricey box set. With the ambitious reissue program in the works, it just begs for a stand alone position on the shelves. But as a single disc CD, this Talking Heads retrospective is pretty close to perfect.and as creative sidemen by now (this was when TIME magazine had given him a cover story as a \\"Rock and Roll Renaissance Man\\").

6305263248|5.0|This movie rightfully goes into the roster of classic spy flicks, like NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, DAY OF THE JACKAL, and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. <br /> <br />Written by David Mamet (see the 2004 Val Kilmer movie SPARTAN, which Mamet wrote and directed), this is a very understated spy thriller that has great car chases, confused motivations, and cool explosions. It doesn't get any better than that. What really pulls it off, however, is a script that elegantly reflects a sort of post-COLD WAR vacuum in the intelligence world, a situation that the movie has as parallel to the collapsing feudal order in medieval Japan, when wandering ronin samurai moved fluidly in a disintegrating social order (see Kurosawa's YOJIMBO). <br /> <br />There are two car chases in this film that are unbelievable. The direction is just fantastic. The character development--particularly of the protaganist \\"Sam\\" and Reno's \\"Vincent\\"--is also superb. The reality of the events is shown in the vulnerability DeNiro's character exhibits. Sort of an anti-Rambo.  <br /> <br />Even the music is subtle and well done, enhancing the murkiness of the plot. A really elegant film; very well-edited. I rarely give five star reviews for movies, but this is easily one of my favorite movies that I return to again and again.
B000089CJI|5.0|Words can't begin to describe how great this album truly is. If you have any form of appreciation for works of art and music, then you will indeed love this album. Ben Gibbards lyrics and vocals harmonize perfectly with the stylings of the tracks to make a simply astounding masterpiece. I'd be so bold as to call this one of the best albums since the White Album.  <br />The songs are simply unbelievable. \\"Natural Anthem\\" uses a truly great instrumental and electric combination to create an amazing score with truly great lyrics. \\"Such Great Heights\\" is one of the few love songs that isn't depressing, and uses some of the greatest lyrical composition i've ever heard. \\"Sleeping In\\" really makes you look at life and appreciate it for what it really is.  <br />In all my years i'm yet to find a single more addicting or amazing album. I can guarantee upon hearing this CD, you will think long and hard before even listening to something else.  <br />I would just like to thank Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello for creating this wonder, and bringing beauty to all our lives. There's not another album I could possibly reccomend more than this one.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|Recently, while browing the horror section of my local video store, I discovered the new Special Edition DVD release of \\"The Lost Boys\\" - which, by the way, I had been meaning to see for some time now, as I am a fan of vampire movies.  As soon as the film began, I knew I was gonna love it. <br /> <br />\\"The Lost Boys\\" involves a family - ex-hippie mother Lucy Emerson (Dianne West), tough-guy big brother Michael (Jason Patric), imaginative little brother Sam (Corey Haim) - which moves into Santa Carla, reportedly the murder capital of the world.  At first, it seems like a cool town - Sam is pleased to discover a comic book store - but then things start to get weird. <br /> <br />Sam teams up with two wacky young vampire slayers (Jamison Newlander and - ta-daa! - Corey Feldman) and begins to suspect his mom is dating a vampire (Edward Herrman); meanwhile, Michael becomes a half-vampire with his mysterious new lover (Jami Gertz).  Can the Emerson family survive a week in this city of death? <br /> <br />Whether they can or not, I sure as hell loved surviving the 97 minutes of this film.  \\"The Lost Boys\\" is an 80's classic.  The stars, the filming style, and the soundtrack all help to make it so.  Joel Schumacher - recently made notorious for ruining the \\"Batman\\" film franchise - gives some fine direction from a terrific script by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer, and James Jeremias. <br /> <br />One of the highlights of the film is its excellent cast.  Corey Haim, 80's fave Corey Feldman (who's hilarious, by the way), Jason Patric, and Kiefer Sutherland.  Sutherland's performance is classic and among his best as the leader of a young vampire gang.   <br /> <br />The soundtrack is excellent, including the score by Thomas Newman.  The film's theme, \\"Cry Little Sister\\" by Gerard McMann, is perfect.  In a way, it completes the film, wrapping around the film in a blanket which gives the film's message: \\"It wasn't their fault, they were just young\\". <br /> <br />One of the greatest parts of the film is the vampire effects, which includes those perceptive, reddish eyes.  Greg Cannom's special effects were ahead of their time, and help make some dark scenes truly creepy. <br /> <br />I find \\"The Lost Boys\\" to be quite underrated.  Most people say it was dumb, childish, or not scary.  What they don't understand is that for the most part, the film's not trying to be scary.  It is a COMEDY.  Even the extremely bloody final fight isn't really scary (by the way, the film is worth seeing if just for this scene). <br /> <br />\\"The Lost Boys\\" is a classic of the eighties, and I think we can call it a horror classic as well.  It has everything a film should have - great acting (and cast!), fine direction, an original script, terrific effects, and a fitting soundtrack.  \\"The Lost Boys\\" is quite possibly the best vampire movie ever and is essential for horror fans. <br /> <br />\\"I don't believe it - my own brother, a s**t-sucking vampire!  Oh, you wait 'til mom finds out buddy!\\"
B00005JLWN|4.0|Take 1 part 1984, 1 part Fahrenheit 451 and stir in a generic kung-fu flick and you have Equilibrium.<br /><br />Entertaining? Absolutely!<br /><br />This is a fun movie. Switch of most of your brain, enjoy the ride and learn about the Gun-Kata. Hilarious!<br /><br />If you enjoyed Blade, Way of the Gun and Aliens, you'll enjoy this.<br /><br />The plot is largely based on Farenheit 451. The firemen not only burn books, they do kung-fu and shoot the supposed bad guys.<br /><br />I would be amiss if I did not recommend that you read Bradbury's 'Farenheit 451' and see Truffaut's movie adaptation. Both are excellent.
B000002L82|5.0|Just so there's no confusion I'll be reviewing the original version of this recording which didn't include \\"Blue Monday\\" or \\"The Village\\" which were just tacked on to the album to sell a few more copies in the US reissues.  Power, Corruption, and Lies finds New Order at a transitional period, still under the influence of the deceased Ian Curtis and trying to move in a newer synth-pop direction, trying to desperately get of out the shadow of Joy Division and Ian Curtis.  So we have two types of songs on this album, the Joy Division gothicesque ballads and the flashy, poppy dance songs.  Bernard Sumner finally finds his own voice, instead of trying to poorly imitate Ian, and the rest of the band members are at the top of their game as always.  This is where Hook's bass becomes magnificent, creating a standard for the genre hereafter.  The album begins with \\"Age Of Consent\\" a well played power-pop number that is one of my favorite songs of New Order's career, unlike anything the members did before.  This really gives insight to where they're heading with their sound.  But like I said the dark brooding numbers are still to be found such as \\"We All Stand\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\" but Sumner actually makes the songs his own, and you hardly think of Joy Division when hearing them.  \\"Leave Me Alone\\" is a magnificent closer, displaying singer-songwriter as a man who's unsure of where the band's headed and not quite over the past, and both in love with and hating fame.  New Order know how to use their synths those, these aren't the cheesy synths that are over the one-hit wonder New Wave songs that filled the 80's.  These aren't distracting to the least and blend right in with everything around them.  Even early Depeche Mode weren't able to achieve this.  New Order show on this record that they can make the fine instrumental too with \\"Ecstasy\\" and half of \\"5-8-6\\".  Both of these songs don't drag the album down a bit and are entertaining.  All in all New Order really hit the ball with this one, as they would many and many a time in the future.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Clever, serious, funny and powerful indictment of the Bush administration and the troubling neo-conservative philosophy that powers it. Michael Moore is a patriot and this movie deserves to be seen by all Americans. Those that have criticized it must have their heads and brains stuck in the sand. Just wait until November! <br />
B000021Y7X|5.0|I was never a big TH fan. A co-worker in the 80s, when the band was active used \\"Burning Down The House\\" as his answering machine message, and I just thought he, and the band, were on the fringe.  <br /> <br />This movie changed my mind forever. I can't stop watching it. I think I've watched it every week-night since I bought it. The band's fantastic: not a punk or fringe band, but an extremely creative blender of lots of influences (not least Al Green), including Afro, synthesizers, and creative (3) percussionists. And they perform with a dramatic choreography, using visual effects and with an enthusiasm that was totally unanticipated. <br /> <br />The movie has to be seen to be genuinely appreciated, my words can't convey its specialness. I highly recommend it.
0375432302|5.0|Always having been a major Da Vinci fan, I decided to see what the hype about this book was really justified. Picking up a copy before a short flight from the UK to The Netherlands, I started reading and basically, I only stopped because reading while driving is bad for one's health. What a book.<br /><br />The conservator of the Louvre museum is found murdered. The police's only solid clue leads to an American professor, who was supposed to meet the curator. Quickly, it turns out he is the police's main suspect. Accompanied by the curator's granddaughter, a cryptographic expert, he escapes and starts a desperate quest to unravel the clues the curator left them, while hopefully tracking down the true murderer.<br /><br />Not only does Brown manage to write an excellent thriller, with cliffhangers-galore, but he somehow knows exactly where my interests lie. the Knights Templar, the Priory de Sion, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Da Vinci, it's all there. While most of the stuff revealed by Brown was nothing I never read before, it was awesome to see those things being interwoven into the story.<br /><br />I finished the book in less than 2 working days, only stopping reading for sanitary stops, work, or commuting. From page 1 on, Brown draws the reader into an entriguing plot, and only releases him or her at page 590 or so, when the book is done.<br /><br />Where can we sign up for the sequal?
B00005JMXX|1.0|This is petty, but the Statue of Liberty is not only facing the wrong direction on the cover of the DVD (and in the movie), it's now apparently located in the East River.  I know this was a fantasy movie and you have to let reality slip a little, but moving one of the world's most recognized landmarks, (presumably to avoid views of the World Trade Center site) is kind of lame. <br /> <br />Oh yeah - the movie itself blew chunks.  Wait until it comes out on HBO, and then watch something else instead.
B000002G7G|5.0|This is definately my favorite Velvet Underground album - \\"Jesus\\", \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Candy Says\\" are my favorites. I prefer Lou Reed's own voice to that of Nico, though she is equally amazing, this album is nice for setting the mood for many occassions.
B0000029GA|5.0|I cant believe my eyes!  <br /> <br />Some people gave Illmatic 1,2,3 and 4 stars out of 5. Unbelievable! <br /> <br />This is undoubtably ONE, if not THE greatest Hip-Hop album ever recorded. <br /> <br />These peoples goving it low reviews saying \\"The beats are bad\\"- i meant GET OVER IT. The album was created in 1994 what do you expect? Futhermore, the beats are extreamely relevant to the mood and message Nas is trying to convey- STOP 'LISTENING' and start 'FEELING'. <br /> <br />The other half who gave low reviews are Jay-Z die hard, hardcore fans. I mean come on- jiggas got skills, but nothing to match this. Even HE admits this is 1 of tha greatest. <br /> <br />Some people even ridiculed Nas's flow, and a few his LYRICS!!!!!! <br /> <br />Stop letting your shallow, modernised, commercialised, mainstream urges get in the way of a true peace of art- which showcases the finest ghetto poetry and captures the everyday struggle. <br /> <br />END OF INFURIATED RANT.
B00003CXCT|5.0|just so you know these movies are the best movies ever and if you disagree you are retarted. but you might say they are not the original Lucas screwed them up. well i'm with you there. but come on starwars on dvd you are crazy if you don't buy them and like them. you may also be asking yourself is the person writing this review a freak? well would a freak have starwars tattoos sleeved on his arm?
0375703764|5.0|I loved this book!  It is original and very spooky!  This is not your 'ordinary' spooky/horror book.  With Danielewski's book, the reader must 'think' (what a concept!) about the characters and plot and twists and turns.  A very worthwhile read!  I recommend this book to everyone I know - whether he/she likes 'horror' or not. If you like the unordinary and to be challenged when reading a book - this is for you!  <br />
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta is one incredible person. She is so talented and so honest with her talent. She's unlike other celebrities and takes a lot of time over looking after her fans, as I know from personal experience. Delta has touched so many lives with her music and her incredible personality. \\"Innocent Eyes\\" is an album no-one should miss. <br /> <br />xx
B0000AQVCL|1.0|It has been said time and again that Jet unequivocally rips off the sound of many other different bands, perhaps in an attempt to revitalize that \\"retro\\" rock sound. If that wasnt bad enough they arent even the first band to do that! Ever heard of Sloan? They've been doing for years what it seems Jet attempted for the first time in 2003.  <br /> <br />Sure, Jet may be pleasing to the ears but, in the end youre just fooling yourself and giving money to a bunch of wannabes by buying this album. Nothing about this group hasnt been done before and they are merely trying to capitalize on a retro craze. Do yourself a favour and buy the classics themselves rather than this rehash.
B000286S8S|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the old Van Halen stuff, but this is just a duplication of their flaming 'best of' album.  What else can it be but a rip off to the fans?  As for the new 3 tracks, they are crap.  I won't be buying anymore records from this band, thats for sure!
B000002J09|5.0|I chose this one because it is my personal favorite. It is also at the top of the list, which is the one many people would choose first. Even though I'm only posting this for Led Zeppelin IV, I'm sure the same could be said for every Led Zeppelin album. <br /> <br />Anyone who gave this a score of 1 star just because it doesn't fit with the times really need to open their eyes. Ever since 1997, the industry begun signing only bands that had a few catchy tunes to their songs that they thought the kids would like, and unleashed their music unto the world. They have been signing good bands, though; all you have to do to tell which ones are bad is turn to MTV, and see which bands play most. I hate MTV, because they know what is good (with the Buzzworthy sign at the bottom right; performers like Coheed & Cambria and Modest Mouse have received this rating, and are examples of performers that actually have talent), but they won't play it as much because they'll lose their money. Since 1997, the mainstream has turned into such a river of garbage with bands that have no talent. hoobastank, linkin park, and blink 182 are examples of what I am talking about. Many of these musicians are average at best, except the others; they are just horrible. <br /> <br />If you want to hear real music, this is the album to get. This album, along with all other Led Zeppelin albums, is TIMELESS and could never be called out of the times. In my opinion, any person who likes any kind of rock music that hasn't heard Led Zeppelin IV, or any Led Zeppelin album for that matter, is leading an incomplete life. This album really deserves a listen, and if you don't like it at first; give it time. I guarantee that it will grow on you so much you'll be obsessed.

B00004Z459|4.0|This CD is awesome.  I don't know what else to say, but that it rocks!  my favorite song would have to be Crawling.  if you like hard core rockin' music then you should buy this CD.  if you don't then don't bother.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill stands as one of the most effectively ambitious examples of creative filmmaking this side of the 20th century. Tarantino's quirky genius--more comfortable in its own skin and increasingly matured--takes viewers on a daunting, dizzying, and deadly journey. The unapologetic revenge flick is the bastard protg of dozens of martial arts movies, spaghetti westerns, and cult films, spanning the twentieth century. Their influence can be felt from the opening credits to the final scenes, and is woven throughout the storyline. So much of what makes this a good movie has to do with the artistic touches Tarantino brings to the screen: utilizing the Japanese style of animation, or exploiting monochromatic filtering, are just two simple examples. Both films boast a rich production design which often explodes with visual interest. The editing, sound design, and directing all compliment a cast of devoted actors--most of whom spent months training full time for the demanding physical aspects of their roles. The film is certainly bloody at times, particularly in Volume 1, but the violence serves an important role in amplifying the mythology of Kill Bill. Audiences will be missing out if they can't see past that violence; the films' many merits certainly outweigh the not-so-occassional fountain sprays of blood. Not for the faint of heart, Kill Bill is an absolute must for those who consider themselves movie buffs, and it gets five stars here simply because of its unadulterated genius.
B000006NPY|5.0|It is a very romantic and emotional goth album. I really love the song Perfect. Even tghough Jimmy Chamberlin is gone and I dislike drum machines, it is a good album.

Dare I say any album....except Afghan Whigs Gentlemen and Black Love.  <br /> <br />Buy this album and buy other SP albums.Owwwya...buy albums buy the Afghan Whigs and Billy Corgan...please get back together with the rest of SP and make a new album and do Unplugged.

B000002UA2|5.0|Most pre Dark Side of The Moon albums except Meddle were very hippie and experimrntal.This was an exception, it wasn't to experimental, it was diffrent though. It was more of a raw sound and a very good soundtrack. Don't mistake, Pink Floyd was always a good band it's just that this album was very exceptional and sounded so good I that I had to tell you all. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC, NOT ROCK MUSIC, ANY MUSIC AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE MUSIC...THEN YOU ARE SAD
B0002IU988|3.0|I had high hopes for this disk and bought it as soon as it came out. I tried to be objective about it in listening to it as \\"not Creed\\". Tremonti's pyrotechnics are evident throughout and Marshall and Phillips create driving and pulsing rhythm on every track. But aside from perhaps \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"In Loving Memory\\" most of the other tracks sound much the same and are often overwhelmed by a rather disturbing muddiness. And I think Myles Kennedy is a disaster and a poor choice for vocals, unless Alter Bridge aspires to be an 80's metal cover band. The lyrics are largely uninspiring and not terribly original and while the music does create interest, even it begins to sound somewhat repetitious by the end of the disk. The only reason I gave this a 3 rather than a lower rating is that I hope that it will grow on me, but at this point it might just come back as a \\"like new\\" offering at Amazon.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am a lifelong Republican, as my prior Amazon reviewing can attest.  I have rarely seen a Democrat politician I can stand, much less their stance on issues.  I stongly believe in core conservative fiscal policies, and consider myself a social conservative on most issues as well.  This will never change. <br /> <br />When I first heard about Fahrenheit 9/11, I was disgusted, as it sounded like Moore was profitting from our nation's greatest tragedy.  Eventually, one of my co-workers offered to buy me a ticket (no way was I going to give my money to Moore), and I did sit through a showing. <br /> <br />When I came out of that theater, I thought my head was going to explode.  Many of my general perceptions about Bush had been virtually demolished.  I had sat there and watched the damn footage.  With my own eyes.   <br /> <br />I can no longer stomach even looking at Bush on the evening news.  Having seen what a phony he is, pompously acting his way through his scripted speeches, trying hard to deceive me, having glimpsed the real man behind the veneer, I cannot even believe that I once held him in esteem, let alone voted for the guy.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, I won't be making the same mistake twice.  I don't support Kerry, as he isn't in line with my views politically or fiscally.  No, I'm going to sit this election out.  I'm disgusted with my candidate, and I won't have the Oval Office occupied by someone so shallow, stupid, and phony.  Anyone who says this movie isn't persuasive hasn't met me.  It changed my mind but good.   And yes, I live in a swing state.
B00006LLNV|5.0|The movie had a soundtrack more than worthy of it. A wide array of intruments are in the hands of professionals. I never imagined that so many types of _guitars_ existed in the world. Even if you don't know a word of Spanish, these melodies, especially the plaintive ones, will grab your heart. I strongly suggest you see the movie as well.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This is a disturbing film. The camera work and the editing are truly unique and masterfully handled. The acting is more than credible. Everything, put together as it was, makes \\" Irreversible\\" a haunting film - a juxtapostion of beauty and violence as I have never seen.<br /><br />This is not something you watch for entertainment. It has lingered with me for days now. I won't dwell on any specifics, but the seedy underbelly of society and the violence that can be inflicted on one another is convincingly slammed into the viewer's face.<br /><br />It can be difficult to read the subtitles and keep up with the visual onslaught. The camera work is fascinating and enhances the whole experience; I think I would have become nauseous, if I had seen \\" Irreversible\\" in the theater. The pacing is unrelenting and artistically disorienting, especially in the beginning.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece, but it's not for your average viewing audience.
630170648X|5.0|I've had this on VHS for years and it is one of the greatest satires and sophisticated comedies. Both Jack Benny and Carol Lombard give two of the pen-ultimate comic turns on film. <br /> <br />Comparing this to Bergnini's tasteless wallow in phoney sentiment (and distorted history) is an insult to the genius of Lubitsch. <br /> <br />If this comes out on DVD, I hope it is loaded with extras on the making and controvesy surrounding this film. I find this preferable to Chaplin's  \\"The Great Dictator. Much easier going down and more of the real courage it took to stand up to Nazis in small ways.  <br /> <br />Lubitsch has his way with the Nazi's with more talent, good-heartedness and worldly wisdom then Roberto will ever begin to understand. <br /> <br />\\"To be or not to be\\"---who ever thought this line would become one of he great running gags.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Personally, I'm into video games, though I've never played Resident Evil. A lot of people knocking the movie say that it doesn't stick tightly enough to the video game story line. Oh well!  I liked this movie a lot. It's one of the first horror movies I've seen in awhile that actually left me a little jittery (followed by 28 Days Later which is a better movie). The dialogue wasn't spectacular, but the storyline and cinematics were excellent.  This is almost more an action flick than it is a horror movie, which is quite fine by me. The action sequences are excellent and well choreographed. The special effects were also good and believable.  Don't go into this movie expecting it to change your life or move you, but it will definately entertain you.
B00008977N|5.0|I have the video tape of that concert. But, I couldn't listen stereo due to my player.. I decide to listen it stereo and I bought DVD of that concert. I've been still listening and watching it. Can you imagine?
B0000C8AV3|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about \\"Infidels\\". I definitely think it is much better than the 2 albums that preceeded it, the painfully mediocre \\"Saved\\" and \\"Shot of Love\\" which came after the beautiful \\"Slow Train Coming\\". The lyrics are here are top-notch, and some of Dylan's best of the 70's. Elegiac, mournful, poetic and ironic in the vein of his best stuff. My main problem here is with the music. Too many of the songs are forgettable and lack interesting melodies and choruses. You listen to it a couple of time and nothing really sticks (except for the masterpiece \\"Jokerman\\"). Definitely will not dissapoint hardcore fans, but I'd recommend \\"Real Live\\" from 1984 which has Dylan doing a live show with the same band from \\"Infidels\\" except much better.
B0001611DI|5.0|Okay, so I hear about this movie from my 13 year old brother who says it looks cool.  Then, one of my buddies invites me to go see it (I'm 11 at the time)  \\"The movie takes place in a mall, and we're gonna see it at the new mall, Twelve Oaks!\\"  Okay, to be honest, I didn't make it through it the first time (It scared the crap out of me!)  I finally watched it again in High School, and it has since become one of my favorite movies.  I think it made such a lasting impression on me due to the fact that I saw it in a shopping mall.  This is the pinacle of 1970's horror.  (The remake isn't half bad, but this is the original)  This film has everything working for it...Director, story, music, mood and acting.  I have since had the pleasure meeting Tom Savini and David Emgee, who help make it one of my favorite films.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I loved this film.  There is not one wasted moment or scene you will see in this entrancing and extraordinary film.      When you watch it you will be moved to tears by Keisha Castle-Hughes performance.  She will transform your thinking of a culture rooted in ignorance and deaf to the understanding of humanity.     You will see and experience through her eyes the pain and suffering women, or in her case a young girl, has to endure for no reason, but the necessity to not change customs in an intolerant culture.  When you first watch Keisha Castle-Hughes act you can't help but notice the innocence in her eyes.  Later in the film the innocence we saw turns into a sadness and hurt.      There are moments in the film where she brings you to your knees.  We really care about everything that happens to her and everything she does.  It's that heartfelt of a performance and quite simply one of the finest I've seen in many years.      Expertly directed and written by Niki Caro this film should be a must see for every teenager or adult who has a teenager.  They will and shall be enlightened...I was.  Easily, this film is the best of the past year.  My last departing words are this...DON'T MISS IT!!!
B0000CAXID|5.0|I haven't been a fan of the Foo fighters for a while, nor have I obtained all the albums, but this was their first one I bought and I just think it's amazing. Dave Grohl sort of takes a different route from Nirvana. His songs are a bit more poppy, but at times they remind me of the songs from Nirvana's In utero album.  <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"This is a call\\", it's probably one of the better songs on the album and one of the catchiest. Next is \\"I'll stock around\\", which isn't as catchy as \\"This is a call\\", but it's a lot harder and it has lots of good riffs. \\"Big me\\" slows things down a little bit, it sounds very 60-like to me. \\"Alone and easy target\\" isn't the best song, but it isn't the worst, it's another hard one. \\"Good Grief\\", one of my favorites of the album. The chorus reminds me of something from Nirvana's In utero. \\"Floaty\\" quiets things down again, it starts off slow but it gets louder. \\"Weenie beenie\\" is probably the heaviest track on the album. It would have been better but Dave sings the song with a sort of screaming effect and it makes the song sound awful. \\"Oh, George\\" isn't really a popular track with me since I get bored with it easily. \\"For all the cows\\" is another favorite, it starts off very slow and different, but the chorus is loud. \\"X-static\\", hmm... I don't know about this track. It's very soft and it sounds the same all the way through. \\"Watershed\\" isn't a bad track, another hard one. Dave kinda screams it all the way through, but it's a decne track. \\"Exhausted\\"... this one I'm not too sure about too. It has more riffs than singing, and the background distortion really ruins the song I think. <br /> <br />Still, you're reading this from a new fan to the Foo fighters. Really, if you liked Nirvana's In utero album, you will probably like this.
0780020685|5.0|Only Alfred Hitchcock has had more glory and praise heaped upon him in our rich cinema history than Akira Kurosawa.  And rightly so...Hitchcock was the best ever.   <br />   <br />But, when you watch an Akira Kurosawa film you are watching an event.  When you experience a Hitchcock film you're being drawn into a brutal tease.      <br /> <br />The Seven Samurai is Akira Kurosawa's best work.   And you will  walk away stunned at the beauty of his genious.  <br /> <br />
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|This cd is just plain out awesome with many great songs like chapter four and Eternal Rest.  The cd keeps up with the heavy metal just like there previous albums but also have a little punk in them.  This cd you would never put down.  You'll find yourself listening to this over and over.  If you liked there other cd's you won't be dissapointed and if your new to Avenged Sevenfold buy this cd today.  This band keeps putting out great cd's.  It sounds like they really tried hard to make this cd one of the best.  If you like Avenged Sevenfold pick this cd up right now.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris is the best documentary film maker ever and The Fog of War is his crowning achievement. The film explores the complexity of war and how it evolves. There is no political bias or agenda here...just plain truth and facts. Great work and a must see.     This film won Best Documentary at the 2003 Academy Awards and many other Festival Awards.  It would be a shame if you missed out on this wonderful work of art.
B000092Q4U|5.0|First off Lamb of God was a underground band for quite sometime so there other records may be unheard of.  This cd though is there most popular and there best.  Every song has the crazy extreme vocals to just plain out awesome drumming and guitar playing.  This cd was voted cd of the year in 2003 in Revolver magazine which is a honer.  I've had this cd ever since it came out and I'm still not sick of it.  The cd features hit songs like 11th hour, As The Palaces Burn and some other great songs.  If you liked Lamb of God before or just like plain out awesome heavy metal pick this up now.  If you want more of Lamb Of God there new cd is comeing out late this year early next year.
0316776963|5.0|My sister-in-law suggested that I try David Sedaris's books, and now I am hooked. The title essay of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" had me laughing so hard that tears began to flow. Sedaris has a genius for describing the absurdities of life, and a real talent for for getting himself in (and out) of very odd situations.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This is definitly not Slpknot's best album.  I have all their cd's besides mate feed kill and repeat.  But this cd has gone radio friendly and it just sounds like there selling out.  Now I know everybody says every band sells out but I don't but Slipknot did sell out.  There music has explored a new environment.  The music is more classical rock except pulse of the maggots.  There is some stone sour light type songs in this.  The music overall isn't that bad but it doesn't compare to the other slipknot cd's.  I know slipknot is trying to reach a different audience and they said now they want everybody to hear them not just one crowd.  They messed up because now I have these preps at my school who like slipknot which is really anoyying.  This cd is hard to say if you will like it or not.  I know diehard slipknot fans say this cd is awesome or it sucks but you would have to listen for yourselves.  If you don't have Iowa or there first Cd (self-titled) then you should get those instead.
0425152251|3.0|Being forced to read this for a high school English class a few years ago automatically made me drop this title onto my \\"dislike\\" pile, but after going back and reading it to see if the book is different now that I've matured a little, I'm afraid to say that it's exectly as I remember it to be.  First of all, this book is a serious commitment. You must be prepared to read it. ALL OF IT.  It's monumentally boring, especially during the lengthy discourses on philosophy.  All of the philosophy lessons are sort of watered-down representations of the philosophers' individual beliefs without ever getting too deeply detailed.  Other reviewers have said that this is a philosophy lesson disqguised as a plot-based novel (and they're right on the money, it would seem), and as an overview of the history of philosophy, it does quite well, despite leaving out a few major philosphers here and there.  Here's where things become sticky. *SPOILERS AHEAD...READ AT YOUR OWN RISK* As film critic Roger Ebert believes, the absolute worst plot twist ever devised is the \\"all just a dream\\" plot twist.  This book's very dissatisfactory final plot arc is a close relative of this terrible plot device, and is bound to let down more than a few readers, especially considering the length of the book.  All in all, the writing style is decent, the characters are tolerable, and the philosophy lessons are sort of enlightening, but I draw the line at \\"bad plot twist\\".  If not for the stomach-rending turn of events in the end of the book I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a short--er, minimally comprehensive overview into the world of philosophy.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you're a sci fi fan and also demand the best of adio video then this set is for you .... I own both this and the 2001 Alien legacy series and WOW can you ven note the difference .... The Quadrilogy has tons of scenes and all the movies have been re-done and remastered ... while the other legacy DVD's are dark and moody, one of the problems they had in the original theater release .... these DVD's nothing less than spectacular and CRISP !!!!
6305971099|4.0|I originally wanted to give this movie one less star, but then I watched it for the sake of this review and I take it back.  I think the hardest part about 4 and 5 is that they are interestingly similar but when you watch them side by side are quite different in their own respects.  Some of the scenes I thought I loved from Part 4 were actually in this movie!  This movie has its flaws, but I feel they may be more personal than actual. <br /> <br />After creating a psychic link with Michael Meyers in the previous film (and nearly killing her mother) Jamie is left in a special children's hospital and unable to talk.  Michael ends up living the events of the last film and finds his way back to health just in time to attack Haddonfield when no one expects it, except of course, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence).  Now with Jamie unable to speak and with Michael hunting Jamie down but stopping along the way to kill people she cares about, will Jamie be able to protect the people she's endangered? <br /> <br />This movie was very similar to the previous film in style and in the \\"feel\\" of the film.  What I like about this series is that it tends to live in two-part films, and this movie is definitely a great compliment to part 4.  All of the cast members come back and with the death of Rachel (Ellie Cornell) nearly in the beginning, it's clear that in this movie, all bets are off.  I must admit, I was incredibly hurt when Rachel died and I felt it was a flaw in the writing, but I think that's only because I liked her character so much and it does successfully establish that in this one, no one's safe.  The suspense from the last movie is still present, and in this movie it's almost amplified (especially with the last half an hour of the movie!) which still proved that Michael Meyers hasn't lost it.   <br /> <br />The DVD is again much better than most in the genre and in the series.  We get another widescreen cleaned up surround version of the movie.  The special features yet again give us an insight to the \\"Jamie Saga\\" of the Halloween series and it's great to watch Danielle Harris talk about what it was like to be 10 years old and play in a movie like this.  If you own Part 4 or if you're a fan of the series, you need to own this installment.  Also, if you weren't as big a fan of the first two and like more modern splatter films like Friday The 13th and Urban Legend (also starring Danielle Harris ironically) then you may want to rent 4 and 5 to see if they're up your alley.  No doubt about it, 4 & 5 are different from the rest of the series, to some that's a good thing and to others that's a very bad thing.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|This is what a great drug flick should be: vapid, empty, and hilarious. Bad acting, lots of good drugs, and stupid drug-addled criminal behavior. What more do you want? Lot's of plot holes, but drugs can do that. I'm on the fence about the acting. Over the top for sure. But, the actors were obviously playing their characters as posturing attitude cases. They even take pride in their shallowness. Extreme, to say the least. Drag queens aren't postering emotional attitude cases are they? Noooo. I have an old friend who's just coming out of the transgender closet and he's an emotional basket case. He thinks everyone hates him now, and the sad thing is, they do. He's not quite as messed up as these two boys, but he could have lent a supporting role. Although I'm not a big fan of transgender films (What straight male is?), I am a big fan of doper flicks and I have to say, this is going on my list of the best in PURE DRUG CINEMA. Wicked, funny, and depressing. I still want to bite Marilyn Manson in his white eye. Not quite as good as 2003's WONDERLAND but much better than REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.<br /><br />5 STARS FOR DRUG ABUSE. I wanna party with these boys.<br />5 STARS FOR COMEDY. Best lines: \\"It's not a crack hole, it's a rat hole.\\" And,\\"Congratulations on your first O.D.\\"<br />3 & 1/2 STARS FOR DIRECTION.<br />2 STARS FOR THE CAT. A[...]<br />and 5 STARS FOR STUPIDITY AND SHEER LUNACY. GREAT STUFF!!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Although Michael Meyers is below Freddy, Jason, and I've even heard of him below Leatherface on the popular side, one thing is for sure: John Carpenter's original was not only satirical and scary, but it had the best soundtrack for a movie period!  This movie was the dawn of the serial killer movies, later known as \\"slasher\\" or even \\"splatter\\" flicks (although Michael doesn't upgrade to \\"splatter\\" until around part 4).  This horror classic combines the eerie fears that it could happen to anyone and elaborates it using shadows to make you fear what you can't see and a soundtrack that'll make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.  Forget whether you're a huge fan of the series, anyone and everyone needs to see this classic.<br /><br />It's loosely based off the classic urban legend, a deranged psychopath stalks the babysitter on Halloween night while the kids sleep upstairs.  Michael Meyers was a sociopath the day he killed his teenage sister as a young boy and was institutionalized.  Now Michael is grown up and has escaped from his mental hospital only to return to Haddonfield, IL on Halloween night to continue his rampage.  His new target is a young high school student named Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who will soon find herself haunted by the shadow of Michael Meyers as she babysits two kids.  Once night falls and all the kids are at home, Michael decides to begin his hunt and he won't stop until Laurie is dead!<br /><br />This film aesthetically has the entire equation to success.  It is a low budget horror film, however it does successfully pull off what most horror movies never do (no matter how high or low the budget): it scares us.  No matter who you are, the way John Carpenter sets the mood of Halloween, complete with the famous theme we all know and classic noir, this movie will give you the creeps (if only for a moment) when in a dark basement.  The acting isn't that great, but it doesn't have to be!  Unlike the Friday The 13th Series or even the other Halloween films, the victims in this movie are truly scared and are given some screen time before they're offed to reflect that upon the audience.  Surprisingly this movie is known as being a classic slasher film although the body count is a pathetic five (but the delivery makes it all worth it) and the only drop of blood in the film is in the beginning (and it's brief)!  Yet no matter what kind of horror fan you are this movie is a must see.<br /><br />The 25th anniversary edition by Divimax is one of the more comprehensive versions of this film and I'm happy that it came out as I wasn't ready to drop $50 on the limited Anchor Bay original print and I kept debating on whether or not to get the extended TV edition or the one with the \\"Halloween Unmasked\\" special.  This version has a second disc that's LOADED with the features you want.  The \\"Halloween Unmasked\\" special is almost as long as the movie and is a comprehensive guide on exactly how the movie was created and what made it such a success (with a $54.7 million profit to date).  There are also additional tv spots, trailers, another featurette, and deleted scenes (both part of the TV extended edition and scenes that didn't make the cut).  The movie is in widescreen and incredibly cleaned up (again, compare this to the grainy version on VHS from your local video store that's nearly 20 years old!) plus you can actually see some of the shadow tricks that John Carpenter intended you to see when he made it (which you'll never catch on an old VHS version).  The soundtrack, i can't remember if it's 5.1 or stereo, however it doesn't matter in the first place because once that theme starts up and Michael shifts in the dark you'll be much more concerned with the movie than with how accurate the surround sound is.  Hands down this movie is a must own for ANY DVD collection.he other Halloween films, the victims in this movie are truly scared and are given some screen time before they're offed to reflect that upon the audience.

B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is a trashed view of the Bush administration. It is one sided and very derogatory towards our leaders in the government. Moore takes no responsibility for his actions, always seeing that it is the other side who fault it is. Don't waste your money or time watching this movie. This is bad.
B00000IQC8|3.0|In 1994 a small black & white success story of a film ended up taking home awards from both Cannes and Sundance all while staying on a meager budget and having nearly zero content.  That movie was Clerks, loved by teens and stoners alike, which combines witty dialogue with the wonderful feeling that grows inside any person who's ever worked retail before and wishes they could do what these guys do. <br /> <br />Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) had a decent life, just not much of a future: he has a great and beautiful girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) but he lives at home and works full time at a the local Quik Stop Convenience Store.  His best friend Randall Graves (Jeff Anderson) is even worse, making Dante's life look incredible by the fact that Randall doesn't have a girl, can't manage to open RST Video on time (11:00 AM), and keeps the store locked half the time because he's next door talking to Randall.  As boring as the plotline sounds, this movie has it all.  The incredible events that occur combined with witty dialogue on truly ascenine situations not only amuses smart @$$es everywhere but ends up teaching us life lessons in the process. <br /> <br />Considering the incredible feats that Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier did to put this movie together in such a great way on such a small budget you truly have to stand back in awe.  Kevin Smith has a knack for witty dialogue and he's got this way of making all his lowlife characters that seem on the bottom rung of the ladder life speak like they're educated scholars of english.  The character development can be weak at times, especially with the odd ways Smith goes about doing this (ex: we learn of Dante's defeatest attitude during a discussion of why Empire Strikes Back is the better of the Star Wars Trilogy) but he meant well.  His responses can also be hokey and sometimes obviously fake or forced just make his joke happen, which I didn't notice when I was 15 but is much more apparent now.  The movie is clearly rough, and Smith will be the first to tell you that this film is filled with flaws, but this IS his first attempt at a film so it is to be expected.  I personally want to give this movie four stars, but as I get older and show it to a more diverse crowd it's becoming obvious to me that the endless banter in a script that goes nowhere and its characters riding along with it that general audiences may not appreciate this film quite as much as me and my friends. <br /> <br />The DVD is quite impressive for an independent Miramax $27,000 film (kinda makes me want them to drop the price now that I think about it) and ignoring my side comments about the price is definitely worth the money for fans and those who are entertained by this fun and clever film.  The picture looks horrendously grainy and for those fans of DVD that expect everything to look like Episode II or T2: Ultimate Edition, this will let you down.  As I describe in my Chasing Amy review, the filmstock used was a weak 16mm black and white stock and therefore will appear grainy even though the transfer is a super sharp 100% digital signal.  You can't IMPROVE the quality of film already shot and without a professional 35mm camera and matching $1,000 per foot film you'll never get the quality that today's high budget films present and this movie has equal quality to a student filmstock!  The special features explore the other directions he was going with the film and has some fun featurettes and DVD info for fans.  If you know this film and like it, you probably already own it.  If you're not sure about Smith or if you found Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back to be his only good film (but you also kinda liked Mallrats) I'd definitely recommend this as a rental because it does deliver the jokes from those films but the style is definitely more independent and (dare I say it) has more depth.  Definitely worth a one time viewing for all audiences!
B000005L86|5.0|Yow, the congos are big big big big.  This whole albums is absolutely flawless.
B00005BL2A|5.0|THis album is different from the previous depeche mode albums, but i agree with some of the previous reviewers, if you listen to it and get used to it and realize all the beautiful arrangements of instruments, i thought it was great. I think the lyrics are very good.  <br />All the people who gave this album 1 star are trying to sabotage the real depeche mode fans reviews and ratings. You can't honestly tell me this cd isn't better than 98% of everything other artists put out. These guys have been around for a long time, give them some credit. The concerts are excellent!!  <br />Personal faves are Shine, Comatose, Freelove. Give this CD a listen, you won't be disapointed if you love Depeche Mode or similiar groups like THe Cure, The Smiths, etc...
0345440900|5.0|Tacy Hogg, if you are reading, thank you... thank you... and thank you.  I am a new mother and a compulsive reader.  I had read a number of books on attachment parenting v. Ferber v. Babywise and found myself in a confused and overwhelmed stupor-- until I found the Baby Whisperer.  Hogg offers a middle of the road approach that is both compassionate and respectful of the parent and the child.  Her approach is frightfully simple to implement and she has amazing things to say about how to read what your little person is trying to tell you.  I read her book when our son was six weeks old and began to implement her EASY system.  Brendan has since learned to take a nap on his own and soothe himself back to sleep if he wakes up in the night.  As a result, our whole family is well rested.  Brendan is an incredibly happy baby and as parents, we feel well rested and confident.  Brendan is now three months old and is sleeping through the night.  He easily goes down for naps.  Our house and his days have order and happiness.  Thank you so much for this simple and insightful book.  <br />
B0002IU988|5.0|This album is awesome! It will really lift you up and give you high spirits. I love it so much. I already have listend to it like a million times. I defintley recommend it to all Creed fans, and even if you ain't a Creed fan, pick it up. You will enjoy it! The standout tracks are Open Your Eyes, Metalingus, Broken Wings, Watch Your Words, and Shed My Skin. But the whole thing is all good! Get it.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|This band should be sued, since they stole their mascot from another band!!!  Overkill had the bat/skull mascot named \\"Chaly\\" since the early 80's!!!  I understand borrowing some of your influences, but this is STEALING!!!  It is an outrage!!!!  D.D Verni and Bobby Blitz, if you are reading this, you should SUE!!! <br /> <br />As far as the music, I saw one of their videos and their music is awful!
0156027321|4.0|When I first started reading this book I didn't expect the long essays on the authors beliefs or philosophical ponderings to be inluded in this novel. After forcing my way through this somewhat exhausting beginning I arrived at the main part of the story and was very quickly addicted to reading this book. Martel's fascinating description of the the human vs. animal vs. nature conflicts that develop are superbly written and with the conversation at the end the reader deeply questions all. Hopefully I'm not saying too much so we'll just leave it at that. If you can force your way through the beginning prepare to be very pleasantly surprised.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Wow, i didn't have high expectations for this film, becuase of the critics. Despite the reviews, this is an awesome movie. It will truly change you, and make you a bit more open to the impossible. It's one of those films that you think about even it's over. Definatly worth the purchase.
0743216458|5.0|This is one of the best books ever. It is very interesting to read and there is a lot of info on World War II. It tells of the less known paratroopers during WWII.  <br />Great Book that must be read!!! And after reading it, go see the HBO ten part mini series that's based off this book.
B00028FDRA|5.0|I already owned the original version of Comalies, but I bought this anyways. I love the acoustic tracks. To me, when I don't feel like rocking out to the original, I can always mellow out to the acoustics. Hands down, this is a great album. My personal favorite acoustic versions are Aeon and Unspoken. <br /> <br />P.S. I'm sick of the comparisons to Evanescence. I find few similarities past the gender of the lead singer. Evanescence and Lacuna Coil each provide me something that the other can't/doesn't. Neither band is inferior, and it's a shame that just because one is successful in the mainstream that it gets criticized so often, just as it's a shame that Lacuna Coil isn't as popular and they should be.

ME ME ME!!!\\" <br /> <br />there you have one of the latest disciples of bono. sure, the band has written some amazing pop songs, but the passion and fury which bono attacks EVERYTHING (religion, the us's politics, ireland's politics, matters of the heart, potatoes, the fact that the price of hallmark cards has skyrocketed, reality tv...) shows him to be less the wordly saviour to which his status has been elevated (no pun intended) and more of that drunk guy at the bar on a tuesday night who butts into EVERY conversation happening around him with some form of overly-formed opinion. <br /> <br />and, musically, the band seems to play the \\"exactly how often can we pan the edge's guitar through each channel and then slowly make it louder louder Louder LOuder LOUder LOUDer LOUDEr LOUDER OOOOHHH HERE IT IS!\\" game with nearly every. single. song. on this album. it's a cliche they'd worked before, but seems to hit its' peak with \\"the joshua tree\\". otherwise, eno did a fine job here, though his later work with the band (and with flood) would prove better served.
B00002E23E|2.0|I bought a CD some time back called Encomium, which was a compilation of tributes to Led Zeppelin's music. I heard it once, barely scraping to the last number.<br /><br />The nauseating monotony of that supposedly iconic anthology is on display in this drone of a DVD as well. Jimmy Page whooshes, Bob Plant moans, JPJ tinkers around with jazz-like riffs, and Bonham squeak-shrieks for about quarter of an hour, followed by about five minutes of audience cheers, of which you wouldnt want to miss a second, would you.<br /><br />Video-wise, during these shrieks we see dawdly 'fantasy' sequences, with some backstage interludes,  where we get to see their acrimonious manager trying on his backend \\"hip\\" and gleefully abusing stadium employees.<br /><br />Not my definition of a \\"documentary\\". Not my definition of anything else either for that matter, with the possible exception of Stairway to Heaven.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|Evan (Ashton Kutcher) and Andrea (Amy Smart) are childhood friends. When Evan goes to college he discovers that by simply reading his childhood journals, he can go back in time and change some unpleasant memories for the better. However, others see Evan as a genetic equivalent of his institutionalized father. The premise is clever and the acting is good, but the scenarios become more and more confusing as Evan goes back in time and tries to change one bad childhood event only to realize that it makes another one even worse. Every time Evan goes back in time to various ages, he has his adult mind and can forcibly change the outcome of the killing of his dog, a murder, an accident, a girlfriend going into prostitution or a truly, unnecessary case of child molestation.<br /><br />This film is targeted for the teen crowd and no doubt will be a large crowd pleaser on DVD. However, there are some small items that `scream' Hollywood inconsistencies. Evans childhood drawing is so good that it Looks like a Disney animator drew it. His journal is miraculously meticulous even though it is written at break-neck speed. These are minor events that remind us we are watching a movie (not a good thing), but some of the scenes of animal cruelty and child molestation (talked about - never shown) are extremely unpleasant. This is the kind of reality that can be done in a more effective way without the gruesome visuals.<br /><br />This is a tough movie to criticize as it does entertain, but I must admit, the ending can be predictable if you watch the first few scenes closely enough. \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" makes for a good home date film, but oddly enough, does not promote the kind of thought provoking debate one might expect from this kind of subject matter.
B0002GTWQA|4.0|Well, Peter O'Toole was never going to find another character or film as magnificent as Lawrence of Arabia. And his first films after that triumph were commendable attempts to avoid typecasting - What's New Pussycat and Becket. But it was inevitable he would again become a tormented blonde Englishman in an alien environment. And he could have done a lot worse than starring as Lord Jim for Richard Brooks.<br /><br />Any discussion of this film has to concentrate on O'Toole and Brooks. That is not to say there are no other impressive performances, or that the film is not beautifully photographed or graced with a lushly evocative score. But the film is Brooks' vision and O'Toole is the one who must bring it to life. They are both reasonably successful.<br /><br />Brooks obviously wanted to create an intelligent epic -one to rival the Robert Bolt/David Lean collaborations. But Brooks was both writer and director - and he was adapting a book that was as pyschological as potentially visual. Luckily for him, audiences in the 1960's were more sophisticated (dare we say intelligent?) and willing to think about what they were watching than today's consumers of assembly-line disposable entertainment. So characters could discuss and debate as well as blow things up. Although the disjointed nature of some of the film suggests pre-release studio interference. In the end, the film is a commendable attempt - perhaps more worthy than enjoyable, but still with lots to hold the viewer's interest.<br /><br />The southeast Asian locations are frequently spectacular and some sequences - the storm at sea and the final battle with pirates - are excitedly staged. The film always looks and sounds beautiful. And, for once, an international cast with various accents actually contributes to the flavor of the script and characters. Stalwart Jack Hawkins, industrious Paul Lukas, wily Eli Wallach (doing a variation on his Magnificent Seven bandit) and James Mason seemingly enjoying himself as a gentleman pirate. The \\"native\\" players are also unusually good. Only gorgeous Daliah Lavi occasionally seems out of place, looking more like a 60's dolly bird than an exotic maiden.<br /><br />But, of course, it is Peter O'Toole who commands the greatest attention. He is seldom off the screen and is probably the main reason for viewing the film today. He is properly enigmatic although without the multiple layers of Lawrence. This may well be the only film in which O'Toole occasionally underacts. After all these years, I still remember the Mad Magazine parody of Lord Jim. Two extras keep asking which emotion O'Toole is displaying - anger, love, determination, fear, doubt. For each one, he wear the same expression.<br /><br />I'm quite glad to have seen Lord Jim again after so long - and with it looking so good. It's not a classic, not a film to be watched repeatedly. But it's a fine example of a large scale epic that could also be thoughtful and almost moving. A relic of an age of big and brave film making.s a gentleman pirate.

B000002H6C|2.0|This was Metallica's last great album (or even \\"good\\" album).  The songs are awesome -- great lyrics, pounding riffs ... this is Metallica writing and playing at their best -- too bad that greatness was not transferred onto the CD.  As said before countless times, the production of this CD is terrible -- since when does a producer attempt to replace bass drum pounding with \\"click click click click\\"? -- and while we are sad that Cliff died, it is not appropriate to mix Jason Newsted out of the picture all together -- give me BASS!!  In any event, the songs rock, so it is not an altogether worthless album, but I am licking my chops waiting for the remaster to breath some life into this slumbering giant.

Burgett's account gives a good glimpse, but civilians like us can never fully experience what it must have been like.

One of Burgett's buddies is alternately listed as \\"Brinninstool\\" and \\"Brennenstool.\\"  Not the most efficient editing job... <br /> <br />Overall, a good piece of memoirs.

B00007AJF9|1.0|Cate Blanchett is indeed a great actress. More's the pity that she and many the other fine actors in the cast are so ill-served by the writer of this script, who clearly has only the barest acquaintance with (or interest in) the real Elizabeth, whose story is so much more compelling than this confused (and confusing) mess. I have been an avid student of Tudor history for forty years, and I was hard put to follow this disaster of a script. Most of the characters are simply unrecognizable as historical figures. For example, William Cecil (portrayed here by the octegenarian Sir Richard Attenorough) was a mere thirty-eight years old at Elizabeth's accession in 1558, and remained her chief minister for forty years, succeeded by his own son, Robert. The film is riddled with many other similar stupidities (check out, for example, the scenes of Henri III of France and Mary de Guise - simply laughable). If you really want some genuine insight into Elizabeth I (and Cate Blanchett is given no opportunity to provide any indication whatsoever of the real Elizabeth's political astuteness, cleverness or humour, all of which kept her alive during very dangerous times), then get hold of the BBC's still compelling series, Elizabeth R, with Glenda Jackson still unsurpassed as Elizabeth, portrayed over fifty years from 1553-1603. There are too many ridiculous anachronisms and other inaccuracies in the present film to list here, but the gratuitous (and horrific) burning scene at the very beginning, the totally anachronistic surroundings (Tudor palaces did not resemble cavernous Gothic opera sets) and the depiction of Mary Tudor as a raving imbecile stand out among many howlers. The appearance on the soundtrack of the Mozart Requiem (composed in 1791, over 230 years too late!) seals this film's fate, revealing the utter ineptitude of its producers.....Don't film makers/script writers do any research about the subjects they pretend to explore? A gratuitous waste of resources, and a gravedisappointment. Someone should make a good film about Elizabeth I, she's certainly a fit subject for one. Until then, watch Glenda Jackson. Now there's a portrayal that Elizabeth herself could hardly have bettered! The terrible disservice performed by an irresponsible (and expensive!) film like this is reflected in the depressing number of positive reviews of it written by people who will have no chance from this travesty to find out anything about the real Elizabeth I. A great pity, and a totally missed opportunity.

B00005JKEC|5.0|I can say that the film has no flaws. Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's. <br /> <br />You can't write a review, without describing the plot. <br /> <br />The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop named <br />Jake Hoyt (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). <br /> <br />During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop. <br /> <br />However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law.... This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and he won the  Oscar over  Russell Crowe for best actor and it was well deserved. <br /> <br />Denzel through Alonzo creates another memorable corrupt villain <br />in film history. <br /> <br />Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors were  nominated for their roles in the movie. <br /> <br />I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!! <br /> <br />The alternate ending is actually almost identical to the original ending, the featurettes are great though along <br />with the candid commentary by Antoine Fuqua. <br /> <br />It was the movie of the year in 2001 and this was before Sept. 11, before we started getting really concerned about corrupt individuals.
0553277472|4.0|This book was a revelation to me when I read it for the first time about 10 years ago, in my mid-thirties.  The best part was the examination of \\"quality\\"; the breakdown of the romantic and classical viewpoints was brilliant.  I'm a motorcycle rider and sometimes tinkerer, so the motorcycle tinkering parts were fun too.  How the story of the ride, and the author's examination of his lost memories gets intertwined with the quality and motorcyle maintanance is totally cool... almost insane (but that's the whole point, right?).  This was a flash-in-the-pan effort - it is my understanding the author never acheived anything again like this hit.

B0002I831S|5.0|First off, Star Trek Gets five stars from me. I watched the first-run shows on TV when I was 8 years old. Unfortunately, on a black & whit TV. Never got to see them in color until re-runs in the 1980's. <br /> <br />I am responding to the guy who rails on \\"whiners.\\"  To quote: <br /> <br />\\"Want to know why Paramount did that rip-off release in the first place? Take a look in the mirror! They knew that suckers like you would cough up over the odds, just as they knew they'd cash in again in the future with proper box sets. Something else: if people like you hadn't bought those original releases in the first place then we probably would have had these box sets years ago. So, you were not only fools to yourselves; you screwed it up for the rest of us too! No sympathy (is that coming across, at all?)\\" <br /> <br />I've got news for you and your ilk. It so happens that you would not have this box set if we hadn't sprung for the originals. Star Trek was one of the first series to be put on DVD in its entirety. Back then there were no complete season boxes of any shows. It was the success of this disc-by-disc issue that proved that there is a market for complete-series DVDs. The next step was to package them in less-expensive less cumbersome boxes to appeal to an even wider audience. You should be thanking rather than mocking. <br /> <br />That said, I will probably buy the boxes to regain a yard of shelf space, get the extras, etc. Maybe they're better transfers too. I'll unload the others at a big loss, knowing full well that I did enjoy watching each and every one. <br />
0141439831|5.0|I picked up Vanity Fair because it was in the bookcase and I had never read it.  I quickly became obsessed with this book and was unable to put it down!  I am ranking this as one of my all-time favorite books.  The subtlety and brilliance Thackeray displays is beyond description.  His depiction of 19th century Europe is both shockingly brutal and absolutely hilarious.  But the thing that really impresses me is how this society, whose morals are based entirely on money, whose members spare no effort attempting to gain and display status, and where the less fortunate are shown no mercy is such a mirror to our society today.  I guess some things never do change!  I just saw the preview for the film which they have made and it is obviously not going to follow the story (how could it in a 2-hour movie?).  So don't plan to skip the book and just \\"see the film\\" - you will miss the point entirely.
B00003CXCT|4.0|My favorite trilogy is coming to DVD...sort of. I prefer the originals, but at least I can skip anything annoying easier with DVD.<br /><br />I liked the new Tattoine stuff, Bespin, the extra Wampa footage, and seeing Boba Fett in the spaceport. (minus the stepping over the tail, which I'm hoping he fixes)<br /><br />In fact, I liked almost all of the added goodies in the \\"special editions\\" except for the Greedo shoots first, the Jabba's palace R+B musical number, and the newer Ewok celebration. I haven't watched them since they were in theatres, so I can't remember any other scenes that felt wrong.<br /><br />It just pissed me off that so much was added, yet the Rancor scene and a few scenes aboard the ships still look really blue screened! If these are fixed, I will be a relatively happy camper.<br /><br />Now, what's this about adding even more new stuff like that Backstreet Boy into the originals? Eegads!
B000002KAT|5.0|It astounds me that this original LP came out in the late 60's, when the average radio station would never have played any selections.  Morrison was ahead of his time.<br /><br />This CD is a collection of music that incorporates  blues, folk, rock, ethereal and soul. It is meant to listen to in its entirety.  The CD is excellent to hear when you just want to hang out, drive, cleaning house, sleep, etc.  It serves plenty.<br /><br />As a young man in his early twenties, Van Morrison has gifted us with this late 60's CD of a lifetime. In 1987 Rolling Stone Magazine rated it #7 as the Best LP of the previous 20 years. That voice, that soulful expression, the way he emotes those phrases and words is accentuating. The most beautiful here are the title track \\"Astral Weeks\\", \\"Cypress Avenue\\", \\"Madame George\\", \\"Ballerina\\", and \\"Slim Slow Slider\\". These particular songs are so beautiful, vocally, lyrically and especially instrumentally. They are sad, passionate, eerie and heavenly!<br /><br />Listening to these songs one right after another, is like taking a ride on that continuous spiritual journey, a walk into his past.  These songs are so similar yet so different!<br /><br />I almost can't pick a favorite from these five, but it may have to be \\"Madame George\\", which Morrison pronounces \\"Madame Joy\\". It is a 9-minute ethereal and mournful song. And take note of the ending, as Morrison sings about the saddened departure: this is the train....this is the train..  I love to hear that ending! Morrison has the best vocal abilities I have ever heard!<br /><br />It is unbelievable to hear how he uses his voice, a voice that is an instrument in itself.  Not only is it that captivating voice, it is accompanied by beautiful instrumental music that was a unique colloboration with seasoned New York jazz players who said they rarely communicated with Morrison on the project. They played to themselves, and Morrison alone in his booth. One other thing, I can't believe it took me 30 years to hear this.<br /><br />I have listened to it over and over and over. And now, it is my \\"Stranded On a Desert Island CD\\" and if I could take only one CD, it would be this one.  .... MzRizz.tened to it over and over and over.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly remains one of my favourite tv shows of all time. The characters are vibrant, quirky and real, their dialogue sparkles; the story lines are well developed, highly entertaining, and just great fun to watch. Joss Whedon has conceived of a future world that is believable, interesting, and well worth watching. Even the theme song is beautifully well-written. I find myself humming it all the time.  <br />I still cannot believe the stupidity of FOX execs for first, totally screwing up the launch of the show, then messing around with the scheduling constantly, and finally cancelling it because folks were slow to figure out when it would be on! With the tremendous volumes of mindless and pointless programming on in recent years, I suppose I should not have been shocked to see one of the most intelligent and entertaining programs taken off the air to make room for more inexpensive, &quot;reality&quot; drivel. I have since cancelled my cable subscrption in disgust.  But at least I have this DVD, and look forward with great anticipation to the launch of the movie &quot;Serenity&quot; next spring. &quot;You can't take the sky from me!&quot;<br />The DVD is worth every penny.
B00005NC66|5.0|I've been meaning to catch up with Jean-Luc Godard's French New Wave classic BREATHLESS for a while now, ever since I became a big cinema enthusiast. Godard is said to have been one of the great film innovators of the 1960s, and this was the film that announced his arrival to the film world as a major new talent. I was able to catch up with this DVD recently, and I was not disappointed by the movie at all. In fact, I was intrigued and often startled by its sheer freshness and stylistic innovation. I was also intrigued by its characters: Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a criminal trying to elude capture by the authorities throughout the picture; and his American girlfriend Patricia (Jean Seberg), a wannabe-journalist who is strangely drawn to the lowlife Michel. This is perhaps youth as Godard saw it: disaffected, indifferent to anything but themselves and their own lives...maybe even existentialist. Michel himself towards the ends doesn't even seem to really care that the police are closing in on him; and by the end, Patricia doesn't either. These two young people are basically self-absorbed narcissists, and Godard similarly doesn't try to connect the audience to these hardly-sympathetic characters. We are often kept at an emotional reserve from these two people, just as they keep their distance from the real world circumstances around them. (Michel makes a fitting statement towards the end when he says to Patricia, \\"When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other.\\") In short, the characters themselves may not be the most memorable in movie history, but their cold, detached worldview most certainly is.    If the characters are interesting to simply observe, the technique is also equally fascinating to watch. BREATHLESS has a small reputation of being the first film to extensively use the \\"jump cut,\\" sudden cuts in the middle of scenes. Personally, I wasn't always sold on Godard's frequent use of it in this film, butwhen it works---as in one short sequence in which Michel tries to describe Patricia in various ways---it works very well, somehow making the film more realistic-feeling as a result. The cinematographer of BREATHLESS, Raoul Coutard, also uses a lot of handheld camera work---supposedly one of the first films to do so---to impart a documentary feel to the movie. In short, all throughout the movie you see glimmers of this film's incalculable influence on later filmmakers (Martin Scorsese immediately comes to my mind; BREATHLESS' realism and style reminds me of his early film MEAN STREETS).    To sump up: BREATHLESS is a seminal work of the cinema that has still managed to remain fresh and startling over the years. Its main characters and filmmaking style still manage to fascinate, and I don't feel that it has dated a whole lot since its landmark release in 1961. It still remains as potent as ever...just as any \\"classic\\" film should. Highly recommended.

0385659806|4.0|I picked this book up because I had hear such great things about it and because I thought the notion of an autistic narrator was intriguing.  After having read this book, part of me feels it might be a little over-hyped, but at the same time, most of the praise is well-deserved.  It's not a taxing read, but the simplicity of the writing and the prose provides a more textured depiction of Christopher.  I found that the overarching twists and turns, the intrigues and scandals, were not all that interesting or surprising.  However, the impact they have on the extroardinary Christopher is very rewarding.  The transformation Christopher goes through is touching and really makes for an engaging read.  The themes and messages are not exactly revolutionary, but this novel is still quirky and fun and will leave most readers satisfied.  A really nice way to spend a lazy (or rainy) afternoon.  I'll be passing this one on to my friends.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Pretty good stuff. He has a cool refreshing summer sound which is sweet for campfires and barbecues. All the songs seem to blend together into one. Some people like that, but for me it gets kind of old. I choose Ben Harper or Sublime over this album but I still think it's worth buying. Check out [...] (Joe Sneva) if you like Jack Johnson's sound. I saw him when I was in Seattle a few months ago and he reminded me of Jack. Acoustic rap with a island sound. Peace and Love
B000054OXU|1.0|I own this c.d. because I own all of Neil's albums (and obviously enjoy most of them).  I will probably continue to buy all of Neil's releases, but, trust me:  this one is an unqualified disaster.  It's as if he'd just heard Kraftwerk's Trans Europe Express and a Devo album and then wrote and released this an hour later in a lame attempt to be techno/modern.  Try as I might, I just can't even give it 2 stars.  I think the reviewer is probably correct who states that it's so bad that you kind of admire the guts it took to put it out.  Of course, this album was one of a few that was rumoured to be deliberately bad to get back at Geffen Records during a notorious contract battle. (Lou Reed famously put out Metal Machine Music in the mid-70's for similar reasons while contracted to RCA; it remains the most unlistenable joke ever released!)
0767818040|1.0|Brian DePalma's thriller about a peeper deceived after witnessing a gruesome murder next door.  Another predictable flop by a director whose hit-and-miss career steadily rises in the number of atrocious flops he directed such as this horrible film.<br /><br />Although it has somewhat of a prototype screenplay, its script and direction is horribly cheesy in every conceivable way.  The only true mystery in this film is determining at what point will your average viewer start either laughing or falling asleep.  But, then again, what can somebody expect from Brian DePalma who, out of about 30 films, has directed only 5 truly worth watching (The Untouchables; Carrie; Scarface; Carlito's Way; and Mission Impossible.) The top-knotch acting in those films had more to do with making them great than DePalma's mediocre directing skills.<br /><br />Don't rent or buy this film unless you're a true DePalma fan or a lover of bad pulp fiction.  Save your time and money by renting the 5 films mentioned previously or just by renting something that's been handled by a more competent director: that way you won't be disappointed.
0393312836|4.0|I did not like this book at all until I reread the first few pages. I had to actually go back and read them over after putting the book down.

My point is that although difficult to read it is worth the struggle.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I confess that before seeing the movie, I had already heard the soundrack of the outstanding Andrew Lloud Webber's omonymous musical. So, there where no script surprices for me - exept fot the fact of how close musical and original movie are. Anyway, the main thing is that the '50s Hollywood through this movie honours the silent prehistory. And it's not only Gloria Swanson, but the instant pass of people acting themselves, such as Cecil B. De Mill, or Buster Keaton. Don't forget the mascile figure of William Holden, some kind of a meta-Gary Kooper hero. A classic movie for the sunset of some true entertaiment pioneers, who \\"taught the world new eays to dream\\"
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This movie does require an attention span. People who blow the lion's share of their movie allowances on action-thrillers would do well to avoid this one; they will be board to tears. But if you enjoy introspective, almost pensive films, \\"Lost In Translation\\" may be your cup of tea. It's true, as many critics and Amazon customers have pointed out: Not much happens in this movie. It helps if you have some interest in Japanese culture, and there is one achingly beautiful scene involving a wedding party in the gardens of Kyoto, as if, in the middle of alienation and commercialism, there might be found a moment of true peace and serenity. The friendship that arises between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, while played out against the backdrop of Tokyo nightlife, doesn't really go anywhere. Yet for some odd reason this film has an ineffable, lingering emotional impact. This is just a sublime little movie that I'm glad I caught in the theater, but make no mistake: It does require patience.
B0001Z37HM|1.0|Richard Fleisher directed this catastrophic flop of a movie as badly, if not in a worse manner, than its predecessor, 'Conan The Destroyer.'  Avoid this film at all costs.    The story follows the adventures of Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), the female version of Conan invented by the same writer, Robert E. Howard.  To reclaim her fortunes, Sojna is accompanied by a barbarian warrior played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (Not Conan) and other characters.      This is just another one of those bad Conan follow-ups that just had no grace or substance.  A terrible screenplay with horrible dialogue.  The action scenes are ridiclous and the sets horribly fake.  Trust me, you won't miss a thing by not seeing this stupid film.  The only good thing about this film is Ennio Morricone's (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; A Fist Full of Dollars, etc.) majestic score.
B000002UA5|5.0|This double album set will leave you in awe of Pink Floyd's early years. The studio recording shows Pink Floyd in a very experimental stage in their careers. Wright, Waters, Gilmour and Mason all perform separately. Some real crazy stuff, tape loops, and all types of instruments being used. The track - Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict, Is out of this world, and one of the greatest included on this disc.<br /><br />Now for the live disc. This is the greatest live performance by Pink Floyd I've ever heard. All 4 of the cuts (clocking in at roughly 40 minutes) are fantastic. I've heard the original versions of these songs, and they don't even come close to the recordings on this live disc. They are done louder, longer and just plain better. Especially the tracks Careful With That Axe, Eugene and A Saucerful Of Secrets. Those cuts are just insane.<br /><br />This is essential listening for true fans, and maybe some casual fans as well. It presents Pink Floyd at their most unique and experimental recordings, although that's up for debate.<br /><br />I would also recommend the DVD, Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii. It was shot in October 1971 in a vacant, 2,000-year-old amphitheater. This shocking performance showcases the kind of work heard on the Ummagumma live disc.<br /><br />If you're looking for pre-Dark Side Of The Moon albums, look no further, this is one of the most interesting albums in Pink Floyd's entire discography. That also, is up for debate.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie was just about the coolest samurai movie I've seen ever! This movie includes everything you see in a samurai movie: plenty of blood, fighting all the time, and great music!Another great movie made by Quentin Tarantino!  <br /> <br />Warning: I'm 14 and I would recommend this movie only to people who can endure body parts coming off and buckets of blood.
B0000640VO|5.0|American audiences seem to shy away from foreign films, especially those that are subtitled, more than ever. And that's really unfortunate, because when a gem like this comes along, no matter how much good word of mouth it gets, many people simply won't spring for it. Let me suggest that if you enjoyed \\"Chocolat,\\" you really ought to immerse yourself in the charms of \\"Amelie.\\" The title character is immensely likeable as she mischievously goes about bringing a little love and happiness into the lives of friends and strangers alike. And don't get on her bad side, or she'll mess with your reality! This movie also has a remarkably high-tech look to it, with its cutting-edge film techniques and sparing use of CGI. Amelie sometimes amuses herself with absurd questions like, \\"How many people are having orgasms in Paris at this exact moment?\\" (She counts 15.) I think you can do far, far worse than amusing yourself with \\"Amelie.\\" TRUST ME on this one.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Wolfgang Petersen's (Das Boot; Air Force One; Troy) suspense thriller dealing with an old Secret Service agent's race against time to stop a deranged assassin from killing the President.  An above-par suspense film in which its fallacies in plot are overcome by a decent screenplay and great acting.    Secret Service agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is an old-timer who's riddled with guilt after failing to stop JFKs assassination.  He soon goes on a race against time with the help of a fellow agent (Renee Russo) after JFKs elusive and psychotic assassin (John Malkovich) resurfaces to do a job on the current president.  Will they stop him in time?    The brilliant acting skills of John Malkovich as the demented assassin makes this movie.  His portrayal of an assassin who sees his victims as hunting trophies keeps the audience in suspense.  The acting of Clint Eastwood and Renee Russo is also quite good.  The film does have several gaps in logic which, fortunately, are not too intrusive so as to undermine the whole plot.  First, Clint Eastwood's character is an impossibility.  The Secret Service agents assigned as bodyguards to the President and other public officials are an elite group within the Secret Service itself: the Service's primary function being the enforcement of federal counterfeiting laws.  Those agents who are chosen to protect the President work only for two years at most and are then rotated back to regular duties.  As with all law-enforcement agencies, the Secret Service has a mandatory retiring age that is much lower than that of other types of employment.    Clint Eastwood's character is much too old to be a Secret Service agent and, even if we were to accept the far-fetched notion that he could serve that long, he would still have been rotated by 1963 anyway.  Even if that weren't the case, no Secret Service agent whose assignment was assassinated would be kept on a protection detail: certainly not for 30 more years.  Another reality gap is the assassin's polymer pistol.  Altough accuracy wouldn't be too important at point-blank range, a barrel made out of even the strongest polymers would immediately melt or explode as the first bullet reaches the muzzle: even with our technology today, a gun barrel has to be composed of a sufficiently heat-resistant metal to fire a bullet traveling at least 500 feet/second safely and accurately.    Despite some gaps in realism, the film stands above average due to John Malkovich's impeccable acting.  The performances of Renee Russo and Clint Eastwood were quite good as well.  This is a good film to rent or own.
0385507755|4.0|James Frey has written an emotionally gripping tale of his experiences with drug addiction and treatment. I have to admire him for his inner strength and determination to beat addiction his own way, rather than just follow the well-worn path of the Twelve Steps. All due respect to AA and its program, which have done a lot of good for a lot of people, but there are some people for whom it isn't the right way. I share Frey's beliefs regarding higher powers and the lack thereof, and people's responsibility for their own actions, and all through the book I was rooting for him to not give in to the tremendous pressure that the treatment center brought to bear in favor of the tried-and-true program.  <br /> <br />The story itself tells a lot about the author. We have no way of knowing for sure how much of it was true, but a lot of the dialogue that Frey puts in his mouth sounds suspiciously like the \\"I should have said that\\" sort of reply that one thinks of after the real conversation has ended. That's the advantage one gets from writing the story.  <br /> <br />A lot of the details in this book seem far too good to be true. The narrator (it may be too generous to say \\"the author\\") constantly and openly defies the rules of the treatment center, but instead of kicking him out as per policy, the authorities decide to keep him in treatment, because, well, he's such a wonderful guy. He becomes friends with a Mafia don AND a Federal judge, and they support him in everything he decides to do, even the potentially self-destructive actions, again because he's just such an inherently lovable person. When the Mafioso says that he wants to adopt the narrator as his son (the narrator already has two loving parents who have made a tremendous effort to come to terms with his condition), my \\"B.S. Meter\\" overloaded. <br /> <br />There's a character in the book named Bobby, who elicits a sort of contemptuous amusement from his fellow addicts for telling \\"entertaining lies\\". I suspect thatthe real James Frey is a lot like Bobby. <br /> <br />But although this book would be more honestly labeled as a novel than a memoir, that doesn't detract from its impact. The most honest parts of the book are the ranges of emotion: the all-consuming need of addiction, the deep-seated irrational rage at his parents and the world, the vulnerability of opening up to others, the calm of reading a philosophy that makes sense. The characters were mostly well-written and realistic -- my favorites were Matty the boxer, Hank the driver, and James' parents. Really, only two characters were too good to be true: Leonard the mob boss, and James the narrator. <br /> <br />I felt tremendously sorry for the Bald Man. He deserved better, but realistically, many addicts' stories end like his.
B000002513|3.0|With WILD, Springsteen continues his evolution from a talented but needlessly verbose songwriter to the confident genius of BORN TO RUN.  Unlike his first album where Springsteen had to fill every blank space with words; he allows the music carry some of the emotional weight. But words do fly fast and free whether we're hearing about Wild Billy's bizarre carnival or the depressing seaside romance(?) on the 4th of July. There is more passion found here than on ASBURY, but it's out of control. With epic lengths that don't match the content, Springsteen could have used some editing here, but it really is all part of the growing process that made him one of rock's true talents.
0316776963|3.0|'Wildly entertaining' is the Christian Science Monitor reviewl. I thought the first half was very entertaining though the humor began to get old after reading the same style over and over again. The second section tailed off quite a bit and got rather morose and uninteresting.

B000002MFE|4.0|No pyrotechnics here; Clapton plays with confidence and sings with feeling on this acoustic set. Focussing on blues numbers with the occasional Clapton original (Like a mature \\"Layla\\" that lacks the soaring energy of the original but maintains its passion)UNPLUGGED is an example of one of rock's finest performers just having a good time. A soothing mellowness is the pervading mood here; I do wish that he would rip into a few of these numbers with a little more ferocity, but that's just not the vibe he's going for on this one.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I find myself to be a pretty good expert on rock and indie rock in particular, from The Strokes to Death Cab for Cutie, and Franz Ferdinand is my absolute new favorite band.  It is one of the few albums I can listen to front to back, over and over and it never gets old.  The diversity in the songs isn't very apparent on the first few go arounds: At first there's some fast ones, then a slow one, then a fast one, but never at any point does it feel \\"boring\\".  All four band members (Alex Kapranos on guitar and lead vocals, Nicolas McCarthy on guitar and back up vocals, Robert Hardy on bass or Paul Thomson on drums) combine to make a very unique, multi-leveled sound, somewhere between the classifications of Art/Dance/Pop/Rock.  What really get's me going is the drum beats, which I think are some of the best around.  Also, these guys keep turning out B-Sides like crazy, almost enough for a full album. <br /> <br />Couldn't leave out my favorite songs: \\"Michael\\", \\"Cheating on You\\" (Which I think might be the next single, after \\"Michael\\"), \\"This Fire\\", \\"Dark of the Matinee\\" and of course \\"Take Me Out\\".  I could very easily just say every single song on the album, because it is honestly that good. <br /> <br />Needless to say, these Scotts are the real deal, lived up to the hype and have delivered fabulously.  I think this quote is a good way to show how they will continue to get bigger, as told on their site: \\"We did some interviews and as we were walking between places we were absolutely mobbed.  It's the nearest to Beatlemania that we've ever experienced.\\"
B00002522A|4.0|This album is an enigma of neo classical death metal.  You have a band creating music that is so harsh and at the same time melodic, that really along with In Flames and At The Gates, nothing like this had been done before.  What makes this so hard to review is that besides album Highlites: Punish My Heaven, Silence, And the Firmament Withdrew, The Gallery, and cheesy yet moving Lethe, the album leaves the listener with forgettable filler.  Stanne falters when left to himself to compose lyrics and ends up sounding clumsy and incomplete in the songs not co-written by Niklas Sundin.  Oh but how Punish My Heaven tears the heart out of ANYTHING in the extreme music genre.  The album is worth listening to if only for that first emotionally blasting scream from Mikael Stanne that ends in a perfectly executed outro of lamenting keys that eerily recalls Epic by Faith No More.   A must own for fans of the \\"Gothenberg Sound\\" and a must listen to for any fan of extreme metal.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Cross [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G Star Trek: The Complete Original Series DVD (Seasons 1-3)]] with the movie [[ASIN:B001K37CT8 Airplane!]] and what have you got?  A laugh riot.  Most times I think movies stand on their own and should not be sequelized. This movie however is a great parody of SciFi and Star Trek in particular. The cast is superb and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Top notch special effects and music. Directing can't be beat either. This winning combination made it a hit with most audiences, not just SciFi fans. So I ask again why no sequel? For fans of drama only, you may want to see something else since this is excellent comedy done by those that have done marvelous drama as well. THIS IS COMEDY, NOT DRAMA! I would be especially surprised if anyone that has gone to a SciFi convention didn't find this hysterically fun.<br /><br />If by chance you have not seen this movie the story goes that a group of actors/actress that starred in a series like Star Trek are appearing at a SciFi convention. At the convention a group of aliens approaches the Commander played by Tim Allen. He thinks they are just convention goers in costume that want him for a gig at another place. When he finds out they have have modelled their spaceship and lifes after the TV show, life gets weird and very funny. The cast must have had a blast doing these roles. Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub we expect in comedy, but Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman have usually played more dramatic roles. They all do wonderful jobs of making you laugh.<br /><br />The DVD quality is excellent and includes a documentary and deleted scenes you will love. Picture and sound were sharp and no problems with playing. Nice menu interface that matches the theme of the movie. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.<br /><br />Blu-ray CON:  After waiting for six days I cancelled my Blu-ray order of this movie.  I don't pay Amazon extra money for two day shipping to have to wait several days for a movie to be shipped when they say it is in stock.<br /><br />CA Lusterie to be shipped when they say it is in stock.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00000JSJC|4.0|Obviously, this is a movie people either love or hate. Put me in the \\"love\\" category. I'm no James Cameron fan, and I found the first hour or so of \\"Titanic\\" so pretensious that I almost couldn't get through it. So I was shocked to find how much I loved \\"Strange Days.\\" This is a gutsy film that takes a lot of chances in terms of plot, performance and presentation -- American critics claim that's what they want in American movies and, yet, when such a film comes around, they berate it for such.<br /><br />At its most basic level, \\"Strange Days\\" is a thriller -- futuristic film noir, with all of the traditional characters.  But don't let the title or the plot summaries fool you -- this is a film that is less about new technology, science fiction and the future, and much more about the volatility of race and police relations in the USA, laced with strong athemes of unrequited love, trust, and the darker side of massive urban cities in the USA -- all presented in a frighteningly authentic manner. This is a character-driven movie, not an effects-driven one.<br /><br />This is also an ensemble piece, where even characters with just a few lines are essential to the mood and presentation, as well as giving the main actors juicy moments to play off of. Director Kathryn Bigelow maintains a frantic, claustrophobic pace in this film, never going for the obvious -- every scene has a point, big or small, which you know in the moment or that you will learn about later. The soundtrack enhances the visuals in a way rarely experienced in a modern film.<br /><br />If nothing else, you will love Angela Bassett. She's amazing not  for the kung fu moves -- her character is the voice of reason, and her performance is stunningly genuine (and heart-breaking at times).<br /><br />This movie is as flawed, and as classic, as Bladerunner. Time will tell if it gets as much respect.
B00005YU1O|3.0|An episodic and self-important script is married to some astonishing computer generated rotoscoped animation to make WAKING LIFE a real mixed bag.<br /><br /> The story, such as it is, seems to revolve a twenty-something slacker who has vivid and realistic dreams.  His journey takes him to a series of other slackers, of varying ages, who blather on and on about evolution and Nietzsche and the meaning of life and such-like.  Ninety-five percent of it is painfully inane, and if this wasn't animated I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes.<br /><br /> Rotoscoping, tracing live action film onto animation cels, is an old animation technique.  The technical breakthrough here is a software program that allows the animator a much greater degree of freedom and control over the process.  It makes for an animated movie that's fascinating to look at, if not listen to.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I read this book following the movie, which I watched numerous times. I found the characters to be utterly charming and found myself wishing to be part of that life and times, no matter how turbulent they were. In reading the book, I wanted to find out more about the characters portrayed in the movie, what brought them to this point in which they were being exposed. Why was Ada so pampered? Why was Inman so damn appealing? Why was Ruby so strong? You're able to taste the food and feel the weather and feel the rough craftsmanship of the everyday living. If something needed to be done, you had to do it or you would starve, or be dirty or be thirsty, etc... To have to know about where you live and how that land lives so you can live with it in harmony. It sort of skips those detailed-details in the movie. The book is a bit slower, but because it happened so long ago, I feel it would be necessary to describe things in this meticulous manner. I find it easy to compare the war stories with everyday living in middle class life today. At least then, there was chivalry and polite society. Today is nothing but money, unproffesionalism and rudeness.If this book were about just the civil war it would be in another class, but by adding this personal touch, it screams need, commitment and survival in its rawest form. PS. Cooking a ham then is totally different than cooking a ham today! If it's cooking you're looking for you may want to try another section of the bookstore; you've missed the point of this story <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|We always knew that \\"Star Wars\\" was Episode IV; that there would be more movies to come.  Science fiction fans gobbled this movie up as they were starved for the good story of an old-fashioned \\"Western, set in space.\\"  Star Wars is not about the special effects.  At the time, though, they were fantastic!  Ask any other 10-year-old boy who saw the movie that summer of 1977, as I did.  Star Wars was about the story, black vs. white, good vs. evil--as clear cut as a director could make it.<br /><br />It's interesting to hear Steven Spielberg and George Lucas talk about Star Wars on the 4th disc in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" DVD box set.  They fondly recall that George wanted the Indiana Jones stories to be like the old serials, just good stories with the best effects that could be accomplished at the time.  George never set out to make a blockbuster with Star Wars, he just wanted to tell a story, and it was a great one.  That's why all the old-timers, mentioned in other reviews, are upset.  The story is still a good one after all these years.  It has stood the test of time.<br /><br />As for the \\"Special Editions,\\" well if they're the Only Editions, then they're not really that \\"Special\\" anymore are they?  I still have my VHS versions if I want to see the originals, but what I was hoping to see were cleaned up versions of the original trilogy when I went to the theater in 1997, not altered versions.<br /><br />When we saw the special effects in 1977 of X-wings and TIE-fighters flying through space, especially as the scenes became more complex and visually dazzling in the later 2 films, we didn't think about what the movies would look like at home.  VHS was not mainstream until the mid-1980s, if you recall.  Yet when we watch the VHS titles now, the escapism of watching a fantastic movie is lost because you see things like the traveling mattes (little translucent squares used in special effects to combine the blue-screen shot of the fighter with the star field background) surrounding X-wings flying through space.  This shows up in the Star Trek original series shows too, when seen on television.<br /><br />Those effects were cleaned up for the re-release, but things like the:<br /><br />1)plexiglass dowel being clearly seen in some of the duels (rather than the special effect glow which is meant to cover the prop) is still there !!<br /><br />2)The death star firing sequence uses a standard (at the time) television switcher (keyboard for changing video sources) as part of the firing sequence.  I've always found this humorous as I now work in TV, myself, but something that might've been updated too.<br /><br />As for plot changes, why did Greedo have to fire first?  We know Han Solo isn't the squeakiest clean of characters!  I love the scene with Han and Jabba, but the clean up of him stepping over Jabba's tail is absolutely HORRIBLE!  It ruins the escapism and calls attention to the fact that we're watching a movie.<br /><br />As for enhancements, the Tattoine scenes outside the bar look great with all of the enhanced detail.  So do the added desert scenes with the Storm Troopers and there lizard mounts.<br /><br />Overall, I love these movies.  I'd still say that they're in my top ten and were at one time my top 3.  I will be buying this boxed set, if only to update my existing VHS titles.  I don't love the changes, but perhaps we will be able someday to create our own favorite versions of the films using iMovie.  Shouldn't be that hard.

B00005JLSE|5.0|I loved this movie! I was never planning on watching this movie because I thought I would hate it, but one day my dad was going to the movie store and I asked him to rent me Chicago or a different one. I was hoping he wouldn't get this one, but he did and I'm glad! I saw the play before and i really didn't like it, but this movie is so much beter. My dad even watched it with me (after some persuasion) and he loved it too! We both thought we were going to hate this movie but we loved it instead. This movie is awesome and it is a great musical.
B000000P11|5.0|A CD that did not capture me on first listen, sat for years on the shelf and almost traded away before the reprieve.  Great music often takes more than a single listen to comprehend, and I'm humble enough to admit that I misjudged my first impression of this band.  But all is forgiven now--it has kept an honored spot in the collection for 10 years now.  The atmospheric guitars are like sheets of ice.  The bass and drums pound it all home.  \\"Swamp Thing\\" even at mid-volume can make pictures fall off their hooks on your walls.  It is a song you experience as much as hear.
0393035158|2.0|[Note: My previous review has apparently been deleted, probably because it went over the 1000 word limit, so here goes again.--CP]  The first thing that anyone should realize about END OF FAITH before they buy it, before they begin to read it, and certainly before they praise or criticize it, is that it is an extended argument for BUDDHISM, *not* for atheism or naturalism.  The marketing copy and jacket blurbs shrewdly pitch this as a \\"red meat for atheists\\" kind of book.  The first chapter reinforces that impression, and admittedly even satisfies that expectation quite well.  But the scathing arguments presented there narrowly target the biblical religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and although they are presented as if from an atheistic or secular point of view, their purpose is ultimately to clear the way for Buddhism.  Make no mistake--despite the initial pretence of skepticism, Harris is a True Believer, and he doesn't come clean with his own strongly-held religious convictions until the very final chapter.   <br /> <br />Attentive readers may pick up on hints along the way, such as his early, offhand mention of \\"a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena, much of which has been ignored by mainstream science\\" (?), and a footnote that cites \\"some credible evidence for reincarnation\\" (?!?), but Harris saves his all-out evangelistic pitch for the very end, which may explain why so many of these five star reviews don't indicate any awareness of it whatsoever.  On top of this stealth tactic, Harris defends his Buddhist views by resorting to arguments from ignorance: \\"But the truth is that we simply do not know what happens after death. . . . Consciousness may be a far more rudimentary phenomenon than are living creatures and their brains.  And there appears to be no obvious way of ruling out such a thesis experimentally.\\"  This is absolutely despicable; it's the very lowest sort of apologetics, always retreating to the as-yet-unknown and possibly unknowable, and hiding behind the ever-shrinking margin where science and human understanding haven't yet come to satisfying answers.  <br /> <br />Harris also engages in some shameless special pleading for Buddhism, trying to exempt it from arguments that he uses earlier to savage the biblical religions.  He insists on an ordinary, layperson's sense of \\"faith\\" when it comes to the latter, and condescendingly sets aside Paul Tillich's attempts to explore a more sophisticated approach to Christian faith: \\"But this is not the 'faith' that has animated the faithful for millenia.\\" Fair enough, and I would certainly agree that such rarefied theologies are nothing more than refinements of error. But then Harris turns around (in a footnote) and says: \\"While Buddhism has also been a source of ignorance and occasional violence, it is not a religion of faith, or a religion at all, in the Western sense. There are millions of Buddhists who do not seem to know this, and they can be found in temples throughout Southeast Asia, and even the West, praying to Buddha as though he were a numinous incarnation of Santa Claus. This distortion of the tradition notwithstanding . . .\\"  If you're going to insist that the crudest, most stupid forms of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are the definitive versions of those faiths, then you can't reasonably turn around and insist that the most exalted version of Buddhism is the only true one and all others are distortions. <br /> <br />Finally, atheist readers should not overlook or excuse Harris's violent rhetoric, and nobody should lose sight of the fact that it comes from a Buddhist rather than an atheist/naturalist.  When he says, \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. . . . Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion,\\" that's a BUDDHIST talking, not an atheist.  When he explicitly and enthusiastically justifies America's current military adventures in terms of the religious beliefs of the Muslim countries with whom we are at war, he is speaking from the point of view of one religion against another, *not* atheism against religion in general.  When he justifies the use of torture in those conflicts (only several chapters after he has excoriated Christianity at length for Inquisition's use of torture), this isn't some nihilistic atheist talking; it's a BUDDHIST!!  I previously considered Buddhism a peaceful religion, but Harris has disabused me of that notion.  Ironically, in a way I'm sure he never intended, he himself serves as proof for his earlier claim that religion is inherently violent and cruel.

B00005JN2F|5.0|So I went to see The Bourne Supremacy Saturday morning at the Cine Capri. Overall, I think this was an excellent thriller movie - about as intelligent and well-excuted as any I've seen.  <br /> <br />It of course helps to have top-notch actors in the film. I love Joan Allen as a general rule of thumb - she is an actor that creates a complete characterization and then fully inhabits the role. I didn't so much like her hair in this movie, but as my friend Brian put it, it probably looked appropriate for the character.  <br /> <br />Brian Cox is a similar actor who fully inhabits his characters. Same Brian asked if he ever played a nice guy. I suggested that his pedophile in \\"L.I.E.\\" was nice, for a pedophile.  <br /> <br />As for everyone's favorite Matt Damon - *sigh. He's my boyfriend, even if he doesn't know it yet. He brings a believability to the Bourne character - a delicate balance of earnestness and intensity. And such a cutie.  <br /> <br />If there is a down side to the film, it is the unfortunate presence of teen queen Julia Stiles. Minor spoiler alert - one of my favorite parts of the film was where Matt bashes Julia's head into a cement wall. Hee hee hee.  <br /> <br />Overall very enjoyable. The plot was serviceable, but much more interesting was the way the film executed the plot - with style and heart.  <br />
B00005JLWN|4.0|OK - Folks, this is a flick primarily for those that love the genre.  No, its not 'The Matrix'; its not 'Minority Report' (both heavily overrated - sorry).  It is in fact a surprisingly entertaining dark vision of an alternate future.  Please note! Director Kurt Wimmer open admits that he is not paying homage, but in fact ripping off 'Brazil'; 'Fahrenheit 451'; '1984' and so forth.  In fact, considering the measly budget the action sequences are pretty amazing.  Rather than using familiar CG effects, the director is forced to utilize quick cuts, strange camera angles, and lighting techniques - which works quite well. <br /> <br />Thus, without the safety net of special effects, the film must rely on the characters. In fact, many of the action sequences are reminiscent to 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' (What?)  Indeed.  One should ALWAYS be leery of straight-to-DVD releases (apparently the budget was covered in overseas box office results and advertising and theater releases in the US would have cut a loss).  But, this is a small gem.  It was not filmed in Prague (like most films are nowadays, 'XXX' 'Hellboy') but in 'East' Germany.  Thus, the vestigial remnants of communism in the architecture really lends itself well to the overall mood and tone of the film.  I suspect with Christian Bale starring in 'The Machinist' and the upcoming 'Batman' films due out soon -'Equilibrium' will become a staple on cable in the near future.
0804106304|4.0|It is San Fransisco, 1949. In The Joy Luck Club, there are four Chinese women who get together, eat, tell stories, and play mah-jong. One of the members, Suyuan Woo, has died, and her daughter, Jing-mei Woo, is asked to take her mother's place. The club knows that when Suyuan lived in China, she had twin daughters, but they were left behind. The day when Jing-mei takes her mother's place, an auntie (family friend) reveals that Suyuan received a letter from her lost twin daughters just before she died. The auntie gives Jing-mei money so she can go to China to see her sisters. She is told to tell the sisters their mother's life story, but Jing-mei says she never really knew her. This starts the beginning of many heartwarming, heartwrenching stories of the Joy Luck Club and their American-born daughters. <br /> <br />The novel breaks down into chapters, each narrated by a mother or a daughter. There is a chart in the beginning saying who is who. The mothers--An-mei Hsu, Lindo Jong, Ying-ying St. Clair--all grew up in China, and there, they went through trials and tribulations that shaped their lives.  Now, it is their turn to tell their stories to their daughters.  The stories have a variety of elements; for example, the status of women in China, Chinese superstition and folk lore, Chinese marriages, etc.  Times were tough in the beginning of the 20th century in China, and Amy Tan does a nice job of illustrating that. Tan often inserts Chinese words in \\"pinyin\\" and that adds more Chinese flavor to this book.  The stories stir feelings of nostalgia in me, even though neither my parents nor I ever experienced events like those. Maybe my Chinese blood is calling to me. <br /> <br />Being Chinese-American myself, I can relate a lot to the Joy Luck Club's American-born daughters. They're Chinese on the outside, but American on the inside, especially the daughter who is half-Chinese. The daughers all have frustrations with their \\"backwards\\" Chinese mothers. Their mothers compare their daughters to each other.  They generally do not know much about their Chinese heritages.  The daughters' stories talk about growing up and learning life's lessons from their mothers, no matter how foreign and backwards they are.  Even in adulthood, the mothers still influence their daughters' lives.  I think Amy Tan is trying to assert that (Chinese mothers) know best, and although I hate to admit it (like the daughters), it is true... <br /> <br />One thing that strikes me odd is the impression that interracial marriages are not favorable. Lena St. Clair and Rose Hsu (Jordan) both marry Caucasians, and their marriages are not very happy. An Mei Hsu, Rose's mother, was never in favor of the marriage, but in the end, she helps Rose to stand up for herself in the failing marriage. Waverly Jong's outcome with her white fiance is more uplifting, but it is not enough to cease this nagging I have with the above mentioned. Maybe it is just me... <br /> <br />The Joy Luck Club is an excellent book, and I am surprised to read that this was Amy Tan's first book. If all first books were like this...wonderful.
0553266306|5.0|\\"The Day Of The Jackal\\" features a plot you know is going to fail, a protagonist who you never know much about other than he's up to no good, and a henpecked hero looked upon with contempt by most of his superiors. The Bond lovers who made up this novel's key audience back in 1971 must have scratched their heads. But they kept reading. So will you.<br /><br />Ian Fleming had his James Bond take on outsized supervillains in blurry circumstances that only slightly approximated real life. Forsyth took Fleming's Anglo love for the good life and attention to how-things-work detail, and transported it to a real-life setting, part travelogue, part \\"what-if\\" hypothesis. He named real people, used real issues, and presented in utterly passionless style a story that sells you on its utter verisimilitude.<br /><br />Forsyth doesn't go much for humor: a trip by the assassin Jackal to a gay bar is about the closest to a chuckle we get; a politically incorrect one to be sure. He throws in some nice descriptions: \\"The heat lay on the city like an illness, crawling into every fibre, sapping strength, energy, the will to do anything but lie in a cool room with the jalousies closed and the fan full on.\\" But for a first-time fiction author, Forsyth isn't trying to sell you on his lyrical brilliance. He just moves you from one scene to another with minimum fuss, a deeper brilliance given he was a struggling writer with no track record with this sort of thing.<br /><br />Spy fiction was never the same after \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" came out. It became less a thing of fantasy, more a thing of life, because Forsyth proved that such an approach not only could work but work better than the Fleming approach. Even the movies' Bond adapted to it over time, for better or worse.<br /><br />One thing not talked about much that first-time readers will likely get is \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" is at times a brutal book, unsparing in its detailing of government-directed torture, of casual murder, of the mass of luckless shadow people with their missing limbs and mildewed medals in which evildoers are able to move, unobserved by the hoi polloi. Reading it for the first time in boarding school, I was taken aback at how harsh a world I lived in, that things like this could go on. Read today, after 9/11, it's almost quaint in that respect. But it's never a nice book. In fact, the casual nastiness is part of its perverse charm.<br /><br />First and last, this is a ripping good yarn, well told with a wealth of lived-in detail. You get the feeling Forsyth, struggling as he was, traveled every yard of the Jackal's long trail before setting it all down. It's not the only great book Forsyth wrote, \\"The Odessa File\\" came a year later, and he's shown flashes of his old form in the decades since. But \\"The Day Of The Jackal\\" began the art of spy fiction as we know it today; more than 30 years on, it's still the gold standard.r missing limbs and mildewed medals in which evildoers are able to move, unobserved by the hoi polloi.

B000094DUP|4.0|I have listened to this album time and time again, Delta's amazing voice and talent for writing never ceases to amaze me. Anyone can easily see that Delta has an amazing talent for what she does and deserves all the success she has gained from this amazing album. This is the one album I have bought, listened to hundreds of times yet I haven't gotten sick of it. Delta's voice and music are incredible, I cannot wait for Delta's next amazing album, I know it will be just as good, maybe even better than this one. Well done Delta. You're amazing. :)
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|I had just finished watching \\"Mystic River\\" and couldn't quite decide how I felt about it.  It certainly is a good movie, and Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were quite good in their roles.  It had a similar feel of suspence as Eastwood's \\"Bloodwork\\" movie.  I suppose that my unresolved feeling about it is due to the ending, which was a bit unsatisfying, even though it was understandable and meaningful on its own.  I won't say more about the ending so as not to give it away, although I will say that good movies do not always have happy endings.
B00006SFBD|5.0|For this reviewer, decidedly outside the heavy metal scene, the initial encounter with Opeth was made through the earnest recommendation of a young fan. Words fail to do justice to the awesome power of this band, which combines the ferocious intensity and attack of the blackest (bleakest) metal, the dreamy lyricism of \\"alternative\\" (read, Beatle-influenced) music and the suite-like passages of sophisticated \\"prog-rock\\". Once one gets used to the dark (\\"death growl\\") vocals in the intense sections, the richness of Opeth's musical creativity will repay many listenings. A word of caution: as the song titles will imply, the subject matter as expressed through the (well-crafted) lyrics is, to put it mildly, less than euphoric. If one is absolutely repulsed by a melancholic (or just plain choleric) musical disposition, it might be best to stay away from Opeth.<br /><br />In \\"Deliverance\\" the listener is overwhelmed by long, complex and often ingenious arrangements that play off the (effortlessly executed) tension between dark and light sections. The songs may perhaps be described more accurately in the singular, since where (practically) each tune ends the other begins. In effect \\"Deliverance\\" is one long \\"stream\\" of continuous music, culminating in a final chord which resonates (a la Beatles \\"A Day in the Life\\") for a solid minute and half.<br /><br />Long time Opeth aficionado's will have doubtlessly already described in their reviews the various roles played by individual band members as well as the producer of this particular album (and its \\"companion\\" recording titled \\"Damnation\\"). For a relative newcomer, one could do no better than to purchase \\"Deliverance\\", \\"Damnation\\", and the recently released DVD concert/documentary titled \\"Lamentations\\", which gives detailed information on the making of what can properly be termed musical milestones.
6305181772|4.0|One in an endless series of cinematic translations of famous TV shows, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, based on the classic 1966-1973 series of the same name, is, however, one of the better ones, thanks to a fairly solid cast and the high-power direction of master filmmaker Brian DePalma (CARRIE; SCARFACE). <br /> <br />Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), an ultra-secret arm of the CIA that takes on the assignments that the CIA's regular staff wouldn't touch with a bargepole.  Their newest assignment is to catch a traitor in the illegal act of downloading a secret CIA Noc-List from the U.S. embassy in Prague.  But when things go horribly wrong there, and Cruise is (seemingly) the only one left alive, he learns that the operation was in fact a molehunt designed to catch a turncoat inside the IMF's midst.  The result is a fast-paced, suspenseful rocket ride of a film with many brilliant set-pieces, all under DePalma's concise direction and with a fine script by David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK) and Robert Towne (CHINATOWN). <br /> <br />Though, like many espionage-oriented films, it can be confusing on occasion, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE scores thanks to the sheer skill of the way the story is laid out for us.  Jon Voight essays the role of Jim Phelps that Peter Graves had on TV, but the rest of the roles are all new (nobody from the series even has a cameo role).  However, despite the casting changes, some things remain the same, like the opening title sequence and Lalo Schifrin's tense and taut theme music, adapted by Danny Elfman (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, \\"The Simpsons\\").  Cruise does a very good job under DePalma's supervision, as does Voight; and Henry Czerny, who had played the CIA heavy in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, basically reprises that role in the guise of CIA director Gene Kittridge with unctuous exactness.  The scene of Cruise downloading the NOC list from the IMF mainframe computer at CIA headquarters while suspended from the ceiling is oneof the most tension-filled sequences in cinematic history, thanks to DePalma's crafty decision to film it using only natural sounds; and the final sequence in the Chunnel is just as hair-raising. <br /> <br />With so many twists and turns, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, despite some flaws, is never dull for a single moment.  It is a great \\"blockbuster\\" film--entertaining and well-crafted all at once, and vigorously recommended.
B000002513|5.0|If I was going on a trip and could only take one Bruce Springsteen album, this would be it.  I still remember when WIESS came out--I loved it then, and it still never fails me.  It is Springsteen's pre-pop masterpiece, before Born to Run (which was constructed for a larger audience).  Asbury Park (4th of July) never fails to remind me of adolescent longing, and of course Rosalita is a classic.  And while I've heard many live versions of Rosalita over the years, they always fall short of this studio version.  The essense of young, in love, and setting out on the journey.  It may be a little \\"mixed\\" in terms of the overall consistentcy of the songs, but that is part of its charm: pure Bruce S. before the studio captains got a hold of him.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|after announcing the release dates for studio ghibli films dvds \\"NAUSICAA\\", \\"TOTORO\\" and \\"PORCO ROSSO\\" as 31st august, disney has postponed the release indefinitely for reasons best known to them. maybe disney is too busy with films like \\"lion king3\\", pocahontas4 or aladdin5 and their special edition dvd releases. films like \\"lilo and stitch\\" and \\"pocahontas\\" are available on dvd everywhere in the market. still disney is re-releasing their \\"masterpiece\\" editions early next year. disney is one company which surely knows how to make money out of its own crap!! one thing which everyone would like to know is why disney and buena vista is afraid to release these \\"hayao miyazaki- studio ghibli\\" gems to the west inspite of aquiring their rights years ago?? they have all of studio ghibli films in their possession for years and they have just been sitting on it!! how disgusting!  <br /> <br />according to the website nausicaa.net the release has been postponed purposely till january 2004 to coincide with the u.s. release of miyazaki's latest film \\"howl's moving castle\\", which is already making waves. how shameless.. just to sell few more copies, why do they have to act so cheap?? or is it just the fear that after watching these gems, everyone will get to know how bankrupt disney and its fims have become?? disney never does such things to their own films. even their cheapest \\"direct to video\\" releases, which is mostly crap, is never postponed. so why do such things with studio ghibli classics which everyone is dying to see and own?? or have they got the \\"idea\\" of making their own \\"totoro\\" and \\"nausicaa\\" first?? remember \\"atlantis\\"....???? disney's blatant rehash of miyazaki\\"s classic \\"laputa:castle in the sky\\". unfortunately the dvd of laputa was released in u.s. by buena vista long after atlantis was released (and bombed, of course!!). nonetheless everyone now knows from where disney got such a brilliant concept for \\"atlantis\\". <br /> <br />and that's just not all. beuna vista and disney have not been faithful to the english world when it comes to the relase of hayao miyazaki-studio ghibli dvds. just check out the same title which have been released in japan, BY NONE OTHER THAN BUENA VISTA ITSELF...  <br />here are few of the major differences i found in their releases in japan and us: <br /> <br />1. now we all know what disney did to the english track of\\"laputa:castle in the sky\\"  by getting the score recomposed even for those silent moments. ok...padonable..at least they included the original japanese track but on the extra disc, unlike in japanese release, you cant view the film in storyboard mode using angle feature. so you just cant switch between the real film and the storyboards. also in japanese release, there's one very interesting alternate opening and closing for the film that has been included, which unfortunately is missing from the us release. <br /> <br />2. \\"kiki's delivery service\\" dvd release by buena vista japan includes a special documentary on the art of urusura, which was used in the film. sadly the people at buena vista u.s. found it lesser interesting than even john lasseter's introduction (which they never forget to add in any of ghibli's release and the worst part is you cant even skip it!!). <br /> <br />3. the lesser said would be better for \\"princess mononoke\\". this stunning piece of art enjoys a well deserved 3disc deluxe edition dvd release in japan which features a long in depth documentary on the \\"making of\\" the film besides other features like complete storyboards with angle feature and multi language track option. they even have a separate dvd release named \\"how mononoke hime was born\\"...sigh!!!! any chances of it seeing a region1 release...??? forget about it..but be prepared for special editions of lion king5, aladdin6....and so on...!!  <br /> <br />i just dont understand why disney is being so indifferent to the english audience.  i only wish \\"NAUSICAA\\" and all other upcoming dvds (including \\"TOTORO\\") are worth the wait....and i hope they include the \\"special documentary on the recently opened miyazaki meuseum in japan\\" as in japanese release of \\"totoro\\". <br /> <br />everyone in the west and around the world loves and adore miyazaki and studio ghibli as much as their own people. disney has absolutely no right to deprive us of such great stuff.its about time disney released studio ghibli masterpieces in a timely manner with all the respect and honour they deserve.
B000002UAU|5.0|Having grown up with this album (I'm 17), it has a very special place with me. My dad used to play it all the time when I was younger, and only in the past six months have I revived the Beatles in my music repetoire. This album is a masterpiece, and as my mom tells me, Sgt. Pepper's IS the summer of '67. <br /> <br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band- 5/5- A good way to start off the show. The concert feel is nice. <br /> <br />With A Little Help From My Friends- 5/5- Brilliance from Ringo. Not the worlds best singer, but his voice fits the song. All he wants is someone to love. Hehe. <br /> <br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds- 5/5- This is the song I remember the most. The introduction is brilliance, and the chorus is amazing. <br /> <br />Getting Better- 5/5- I like the contrast between Paul and John. \\"I have to admit its getting better\\" vs \\"It couldn't get much worse\\" <br /> <br />Fixing A Hole- 5/5- In my opinion, a very underrated song by the Beatles. Minds wandering...it's great. <br /> <br />She's Leaving Home- 4/5- Another underrated song. It starts out a little boring, but the chorus is brilliant, voices are amazing. <br /> <br />Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite- 4/5- Another prominent song in my memory. I love the part where it turns to the waltz, it just shows off their musical talent. <br /> <br />Within You, Without You- 3/4- Even though I'm not a fan of this song, I recognize the talent it conveys on George's part. Always the George fan, I'm glad he had such a sucessful contribution to this album. <br /> <br />When I'm Sixty-Four- 5/5- Hard to believe Paul wrote this as a teenager. A nice little love ditty. <br /> <br />Lovely Rita- 5/5- A song I particularly like. I especially adore the whole rumours about how Paul \\"died\\" when he glanced over at 'Rita'.  <br /> <br />Good Morning, Good Morning- 3/5- Definately not my favorite song, but it's \\"cute\\". I know John hated it, so I've always wondered why it made it on the album. <br /> <br />Sgt. Pepper's Reprise- 5/5- I actually like this better than the first track version. The drum beat in the beginning is awesome, and when Paul goes \\"one, two, three, four\\", and the song just takes off. <br /> <br />A Day In The Life- 5/5- If I could rate it infinity, I would. This song is absolute brilliance. I know enough about the technicalities of music to know that this song is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, the album is a stroke of genius. I don't think it's ever been matched. However, everyone go buy Abbey Road as well :-). ~*~IMAGINE~*~

1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now: a Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, by Eckhart Tolle <br /> <br />This extraordinary book should be on the required reading list of every high school. The Power of Now is a guide on finding inner peace and spiritual enlightenment by focusing on the \\"eternal present.\\" Gently yet with great clarity, Eckhart Tolle shares wisdom tapped from the collective consciousness and teaches you how to rise above the chatter of the mind and pain-body. <br /> <br />The first chapter, You Are Not Your Mind, reflects on the qualities of enlightenment and Being. Enlightenment, Tolle writes, is \\"finding your true nature beyond name and form\\", and \\"a state of wholeness, of being `at one' and therefore at peace.\\" He describes Being as \\"the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death,\\" as \\"your very essence, the feeling of your own presence.\\" He explains that the mind is a tool of the ego, not a reflection of the self. In order to attain enlightenment, you must come to a realization that the mind is not your identity, and \\"that all things that truly matter - beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace - arise from beyond the mind.\\" <br /> <br />Tolle then sends you on a journey to consciousness. He teaches you how to be deeply present in the now, and accepting all things as they are. In chapter five, The State of Presence,\\" he gives practical instruction on how to \\"inhabit your body fully.\\" Consciousness occurs, Tolle says, \\"When Being becomes conscious of itself.\\" He then goes on to describe how to ground and transform yourself by connecting with your inner body.  <br /> <br />In Chapter seven, Portals of the Unmanifested, Tolle discusses how space and silence are the source of all life energy. Every night, in dreamless sleep, you take a journey into the Unmanifested and merge with the Source, drawing the energy essential for sustenance in the world of manifested, separate forms. The major portals into the Unmanifested are through the inner body, the Now, the cessation of thinking, and surrender. \\"Just as no sound can exist without silence,\\" Tolle explains, \\"nothing can exist without no-thing, without the empty space that enables it to be.\\" <br /> <br />Though the power of now, with sustained attention and acceptance, you can also experience enlightened relationships. This requires you to stop judging, to release the ego, and let go of the pain of the collective unconscious. <br /> <br />In chapter nine, Beyond Happiness and Unhappiness There is Peace, you learn how to rise above the mind-based concept of good and bad. You can find peace within by relinquishing your life drama, accepting that life is cyclical and temporary, and releasing negativity. \\"Don't look for peace,\\" Tolle advises. \\"Don't look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your no-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender.\\" <br /> <br />True compassion, according to Tolle, is \\"awareness of a common bond of shared mortality and immortality. At this deep level, compassion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state, your healing influence is primarily based not on doing but on being. Everybody you com in contact with will be touched by your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate, whether they are conscious of it or not.\\" <br /> <br />In The Meaning of Surrender, the final chapter, Tolle explains that surrender is \\"yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life,\\" to \\"accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation,\\" and \\"to relinquish inner resistance.\\" Only by surrendering to the present moment can spiritual energy come into this world. That is the power of now.

B00028HBL6|2.0|One struggles to compare details of this plot with the various Gospels.  So much is added in that it is difficult for someone with only a passing knowledge of the Gospels to know what is genuine and what is added in.  The addition of a Satan figure in many places is odd; the flogging episode is portrayed as violently as possible, with Jesus virtually taunting the guards to punish him further; there are times when various people are shown interacting with Jesus while he is on his way to Golgotha.  There are many more and these are just off the top of my head after seeing it 6 months ago. <br /> <br />If one is a Christian, then there is a good possibility that you will come to either hold this video in low esteem, or question your beliefs.

B00000JCOV|5.0|I first bought this cd while (ok laugh at me) browsing through the CD section of K-mart. I heard of them before then, so I decided to check it out. it instantly became a favorite of mine. They combine crazy riffs with weird techno and samples stcuk in with some real heavy drums. favorite tracks- Eyeless, Surfacing, tattered and Torn, SPit it Out. If you liked this get anything by System of a Down.
B00005JLFC|5.0|There are moments in your life you never forget and this is definitely one of them!!   Why no release on DVD?????  This is crazy when so much crap is out on DVD but not a classic once in a lifetime motion picture like Yentl!!!!  Please wake up!!!!!
B00005A46T|4.0|I may be one of the few that actually liked this cd a lot. Sounds pretty similar to \\"Slipknot\\", but more dark, and less cynical. Not as creative as the orignal though. Best songs are \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" and \\"Disasterpieces\\"..ok most of the songs are pretty similar so i suggest all except 515 which is the usual Slipknot Intro track. Overall i would suggest the self-titled cd before this one.
0385336810|4.0|I am in the process of reading Anna Karinina, the classic Leo Tolstoy novel, and while it is very interesting, I needed a break!  So I decided to pick up Sophie Kinsella's new book and it was exactly what I needed!  `CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?' is light hearted and funny with all of the charm of Kinsella's `SHOPAHOLIC' series.<br /><br />Emma is trying to climb her way up the corporate ladder at her marketing firm to no avail.  While on a return flight from a business trip gone completely wrong she meets a handsome stranger.  As the plane experiences a frightening amount of turbulence, Emma spills every detail imaginable about her life to this stranger.  Upon return to work Emma finds the company abuzz with the anticipation of a visit from the companies founder Jack Harper, which to Emma's surprise happens to be the stranger from the plane!<br /><br />The story takes a hilarious turn as Emma not so skillfully tries to avoid Jack, while Jack tries his hardest to spend as much time with Emma, his new ally, as possible.  `CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET' gave me a fun three-day break from a tough novel and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it!  4 ½ Stars!!
1573226521|5.0|Alex Garland's The Beach is one of the best books I have ever read. He hooks you from the very start with intriguing descriptions and thought processes. Garland's style is original and never drifts towards the cheesy or bland. His insight into the psychology of smaller groups is so alarmingly acurate that one has to wonder if the story was at one time a reality. One would be hard pressed to find another author of Garland's caliber who also has Garland's respect for the assumed intelligence of his audience.
0425173755|5.0|In this wonderfully written book, Murder on the Orient Express, Belgian Detective Hercule Poirot is given a confusing and almost impossible mission. He must find the murderer of Mr. Ratchett, a wealthy American.     As the story begins Hercule Poirot is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey. Traveling with him, by train, are two other passengers; Mary Debenham and Colonel Arubthnot. When they finally arrive Hercule Poirot drives straight to the Tokatlian Hotel. There he receives an urgent telegram for him to travel back to London. He tells the hotel to book a compartment on the first train back to London, which was at nine o'clock. He eats dinner and meets a friend, Mr. Bouc, the director of the Campagnie Internationale des wagons lits. When it is time to board the train the conductor tells Mr. Poirot that the train is full. \\"It is incredible, Mounsier. All the world elects to travel tonight\\" he says. But there is one passenger who hasn't arrived yet, so the conductor tells Hercule that he may take his place.       As the train starts off on its three day journey across Europe every thing is going well, or so it seems. Hercule notices that Mary Debenham and Colonel Arubthnot are traveling with him again. After dinner Mr. Ratchett offers Hercule a highly paid job. Mr. Ratchett, a wealthy man, has an enemy and he requires safety, but Hercule only takes cases that interest him, so he rejects. Later that day the train arrives at Belgrade. Mr. Poirot is moved into the compartment No. 1, the compartment of Mr. Bouc. Mr. Bouc was moved into the Athens coach, which was put on at the Belgrade station.      In the middle of the night Hercule Poirot is awaken from a load groan. Hercule notices that the train is at a stand still. He presumes it's at a station. He hears Mr. Ratchett talking to the conductor in the next compartment. Hercule glances at his watch; it is just 23 minutes to one. Relieved, he goes back to his bed. He finds it hard to fall asleep since the train is stationary. He notices that he forgot to ask for his usual bottle of mineral water so he rings the conductor bell. The conductor comes and Hercule asks for a bottle of mineral water. As the conductor gets the bottle Hercule asks why it is so quiet in the station outside. The conductor tells him that they aren't in a station but stuck in a snowdrift.     The next day Mr. Ratchett is found dead of multiple stab wounds in his compartment. The murderer is still on the train. Hercule Poirot must find out who murdered Mr. Ratchett. The evidence shows that the murderer must have been from the Calais coach. There are 13 suspects, but who did it?     Was it the calm Mary Debenham, or the dramatic Mrs. Hubbard? Could it have been Hector Macqueen, Mr. Ratchett's secretary? Or could Princess Dragomiroff have been the murderer? To find out - read this wonderful book, Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie!    Agatha Christie's many fans will live this suspenseful mystery that will keep you guessing to the end. If you're looking for a wonderful mystery or just a nice book to read, this book is the book for you!
0743455967|5.0|When one of the best selling authors writes a book \\"on writing\\" you make it a part of your collection.  Stephen King is a name synonymous with fictional horror writing.  But he also wrote a non-fiction book \\"On Writing\\" published in 2000. I had to read it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br /> \\"On Writing\\" is part memoir and part how I write.  It is delivered in Stephen King opinionated style as only he can write it.  Stephen King gives tidbits of his life before hitting it \\"big\\" and actually getting paid to write.  I did notice a lot of beer was included in his early years. Tall boys and writing what a combination! It is nice to read about a very successful author and how it all started for him. They called him Stevie back in those days, but today he is Mr. King. Well, Stephen anyway.<br /><br />  Stephen King started writing this book in December of 1997. It was published in 2000.  For him it was a long process.  He had to put it in a drawer to hide or marinate, which is not a bad thing he explains. There was a well-documented accident in 1999. Stephen writes what he accounts about the accident. (What he remembers anyway.) I say he is a lucky, lucky man. Stephen's writing account about this accident is well worth the price of the book.<br /><br />  Stephen King gives plenty of his opinion on other authors. Good and bad. But gives the reasons why he feels so.  \\"Great authors are not made, but born\\" Stephen says.  Good authors can be made, like himself.  I think he categorizes himself in the good section.<br /><br />  The majority of his writing process is credited to William Strunk's \\"Elements of Style.\\" Translated with these statements, \\"The adverb is not your friend\\" and \\"It's always about the story.\\" These statements are interjected into many sections of the book. Writer wannabes can take heed to many of his writing habits, I said slowly.<br /><br />  Stephen compares his process of writing to a toolbox.  There are many levels in this toolbox. Drawers can be taken out and interchanged. But there should be at least four levels to your toolbox.  The top levels include vocabulary and grammar. Style is next. The next levels could include pace, narration, description and dialogue. And many more levels, depending on the author's need. Stephen gives his view on each of these levels. You ask, what about plot? Well, Stephen's opinion on plot is included in the book. Like his novels, I can't give it all away in one review or book!<br /><br />The most important advice, \\"Read a lot, write a lot.\\"awers can be taken out and interchanged.

0790729970|3.0|THIS JIM CARREY FLICK, WHICH WAS ANOTHER BIG HIT FOR JIM CARREY, IS ABOUT A BANKER WHO DISCOVERS A MASK THAT TURNS WHOEVER'S WEARING IT INTO A WACKY SUPERHERO. THE MOVIE'S ALRIGHT. IT DOES HAVE ITS FUNNY MOMENTS. THE SEXY CAMERON DIAZ MADE HER FILM DEBUT IN THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS GOOD FOR COMEDY FANS. EVEN THOUGH IT COULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS. FOLLOWED BY A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED SERIES.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|If your having a problem falling asleep at night, I would deffinately reccomend this movie. I was wide awake when I started it, and while I was watching it I had to pry my eyes open. I was so damn close to falling asleep. When there was only 10 minuites left of the first half, I shut it off and took a nap. Everything I just said is 100% true. This movie is so boring.
B00028HBKM|5.0|My husband and I are devout Christians. When seeing this film in the theatre, we were both speechless. It was an amazing film and it was so accurate we could not believe it. This film not only brought us closer to God in our Christian walk but it also brought us closer together in actually experiencing this together. Mel Gibson did a fabulous job with this film and he should be praised highly for such an incredible and accurate interpretation of the Bible and of the Lord's devotion to us.
B00005JLR8|4.0|I read in an interview that Jim Sheridan started off writing the father as the protagonist for this film but eventually gave up because it was too difficult and awkward to make himself the main focus (it's no secret this is autobiographical).  So he phoned up his daughters, grown up, and asked for their recollections of the family's move to the States when they were children.  This is the narrative he used in crafting his film, which may in part explain the fantastical nature of much of the plot.  To those who want more gritty realism from the film -- look back to your own childhood memories and ask yourself if you actually remember everything factually the way it happened.  Film is art.  In this case it's dreamy, magnificent art, and remembering the way things felt is every bit as valuable as remembering the way things were.
B00004Z459|5.0|To me this is one of the best bands out there, and their debut album proves it. I could not find a song that I didn't like on here. Now I can't say that everyone will love this, so borrow it from a friend and see what u think. If you like it, dont burn it, its well worth the buy. Also, dont confuse this with punk rock or heavy metal - it just pisses off the punkers and metal dudes
B000267JQK|5.0|I started likin Seether when I heard Fine Again so much on the radio but I didn't become a big Seether fan until I saw them live w/ Breaking Benjamin , Three Days Grace all on the Evanescence Summer Tour 2004 on Aug. 8, 2004 in Corpus Christi, TX. This cd was worth every penny. Everytime I listen to this cd, I can't just skip to one song, I have to listen to the whole thing because it's that good of a cd. If you are not a Seether fan, this cd will change that...promise
0394800192|5.0|An inspired bit of whimsy. Using spare text for very beginning readers, this story tells the absurd tale of a dog, a lion, and a tiger who start balancing apples on their heads. Soon they each have a bunch of apples stacked on top of themselves, having purloined a few from a bear's icebox. The bear is not happy with this and seeks to topple their apples with her mop. While the apple stackers start out as rivals, they soon become friends as  a variety of spoilsports end up chasing our heroes, trying to get the precarious apples to fall off their heads - all of which leads to a spectacular and pleasing ending. The cartoon illustrations are direct and manage to do much with little. This story is a masterpiece of escalation, silly joy, counting, and simple vocabulary all in one. I still enjoy it as an adult!
B000002KON|5.0|For all the billing this album gets as an ode to Victorian England or a vivid embrace of what it became by 1969, many of the gripes and images Ray turns up here sure sound a lot like American suburbia:<br /><br />And all the houses in the street have got a name<br /><br />'Cos all the houses in the street they look the same<br /><br />Same chimney pots, same little cars, same window panes<br /><br />The neighbors call tot ell you things you should know<br /><br />They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go<br /><br />So much of this flawless record conjures images of an all-to-familiar political and emotional landscape, and it is this enduring relevance that ranks The Kinks as one of a few rock bands people might listen to centuries from now. It is wonderful to listen in as Ray patiently grows into the nostalgia, irony and compassion for which his lyrical voice would soon earn its distinction. Ray's lyrics are at their finest here when he sicks his ironic satire on \\"Mr. Churchill\\" and the cold war era:<br /><br />Mr Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin<br /><br />And all the garden gates<br /><br />And empty cans are gonna make us win<br /><br />Similarly, lines like \\"Back home they put his picture in a frame/But all dead soldiers look the same\\" aspire toward the anti-war poetry of Thomas Hardy or Wilfred Owen.<br /><br />As for the music, many of these tunes play more like suites than songs, starting in one direction and then marching off in entirely another that is equally if not even more engaging. \\"Mr Churchill Said\\" launches into a searing and addictive guitar jam, while \\"Shangri-la\\" is as haunting an epic as \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" or even Dylan's \\"Desolation Row.\\" Dave's guitar licks are as tight and moving as ever here, while Ray's vocal melodies screw themselves into the listener's consciousness with all the permanence of a tattoo. You only have to go a few songs into this album to realize that it represents one of the most amazing fits of creativity in rock history -- and one that would continue for decades to come.history -- and one that would continue for decades to come.

B00023BLXK|5.0|Obviously, these articles that do not enjoy the movie were written by americans. Spoiled americans who don't know what it is like to live under a dictator to have their home taken away from them... because if you are Cuban you understand the movie. Lack of money? No.. it isn't about making a great movie and it isn't about creating another \\"Dirty dancing.\\" It is about CUBANS. It is about their struggle and them trying to find freedom in a country where it just never existed. Look beyond the superfical..\\"lack of money.\\" It's a beautiful story and portays Cuba exactly. Can't you just feel the passion of the land and it's people when you watch it. It's beautiful and I recommend it to all.
B00006GFAB|3.0|Okay, first things first. I'm a BIG Kiss fan. I'm objective and I don't think that they lack any talent, and most of all, their music ain't crap as many people say. I think they never really listened to it and still are bashing the band because all they know about Kiss is Simmons tongue. Now, on to the main problem.    With all of those voices about \\"how many best of's do we need already\\", I did some research here on Amazon to find out the real numbers behind all of this (just to be accurate). So I divided all their compilations in two sections:    a) before the release of \\"Psycho Circus\\" (their last STUDIO album)    - here we have:  1. Smashes, Trashes & Hits  2. Greatest Hits (also known as Greatest Kiss) with 3 different editions  3. Double Platinum  4. Killers with 2 different editions  5. Hit Collection '75, '77 & '78    summary: 7 compilations (10 with different editions of the same CD)    b) after \\"Psycho Circus\\"    - on to the business (Gene, pretend that this word isn't here, ok?):  1. The Very Best Of Kiss  2. 20th Century Masters: Millennium Collection 1 & 2  3. Kiss [BOX SET] with 2 different editions    summary: 4 compilations (5 if you count that limited edition of the box set)    Now something that we all waited for - the final calculation:  7(10) + 4(5) = 11(15)! greatest hits, best of's and others. And that's the stuff available only here on Amazon! Just imagine that countless other unofficial editions (under different labels etc.), uhhh my head hurts.    \\"The Very Best Of Kiss\\" is the only compilation I own and it's the last Kiss compilation I ever bought. Not to mention the omissions of \\"God Of Thunder\\", \\"Black Diamond\\", \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" and \\"Unholy\\". Overall it's decent for newcomers, to make them interested in band, but completely worthless for fans (but you know that better than me).  Oh, and let me say in the end that I always liked Gene the least of all the band members (who knows if not at all), and now I know why.    Something tells me, that we made another page in Kisstory today.
B0002I831S|5.0|Just because someone was wondering... if anyone wants to see a comprehensive list of everything (I mean absolutely everything - all the audio for every individual episode, etc.) that is included, just go to the Canadian Amazon website (www.amazon.ca) and look for the set there - it has more (ALL) of the information not contained here.
B00024BHTC|1.0|This is the crappiest album I have heard this year.  What beutiful vocals I ask?  What beutiful ballads?  Yer right. I give this a thumbs down.  The review system is being totally abused, as I belive a lot of these '5' reviews are coming from the same people. Nightwish are the worst Metal band thats come out in over decade.  Period.
B00000I41J|5.0|Just one of the best jazz albums ever recorded.  Lineup:  Cannonball Adderly, Miles Davis, Hank Jones, Sam Jones, Art Blakey.  Reminds you of the '27 Yanks, a murderer's row of great talent.  Great companion to the Miles Davis Kind of Blue album, another one in the top ten.
B000000OQF|5.0|When \\"Hollywood Rose\\" and \\"Guns\\" merged to form the best band of the 80's(and the 90's, for that matter)they kicked off their career with the masterpiece called \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" To agree with most of my preceeding reviewers, I will concur that the album, although somewhat overplayed, is anything but overrated.  <br /> Kicked off with the group's adrenaline pumping anthem, \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" is GnR's ultimate song. Although far from my favorite, nothing speaks for the band like their angry, expressive opening track. Moving on to a song you haven't heard, \\"It's So Easy\\" is a memorable, highly loveable tune. Instantly one of my favorites on the CD, this song will expose you to another aspect of this multifaceted band. \\"Nightrain,\\" my second favorite song on the album, is as explosive and energetic as it is fundamentally excellent and diverse. \\"Out ta' Get Me,\\" although not one of their best, is a fun and fast punkish song. I like it, and on other CDs it would shine, but compared to the other material we have here, it falls short. Speaking of other excellent material, next we are introduced to the criminally underrated, lyrical gem of \\"Mr. Brownstone.\\" From underrated, to slightly overrated, we now are taken down to \\"Paradise City\\" which holds most of its glory in the last minute and a half.  <br />  Next up, powerful, robust, controversial, and wonderful is \\"My Michelle.\\" This is the album's most headbanging song, one that you can't hum while standing still. \\"Think About You\\" is a pleasant change of topic from the prior songs. Personally, I don't think it lives up to the hype that it gets from a lot of other reviewers. Still an excellent song, but not in my top five for the CD. Following is my undisputable favorite, not just on Appetite, but for any by GnR. \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" opens with a riff that started as a joke, but has grown to be my favorite intro to any song (following perhaps \\"Purple Haze\\". The lyrics, sweet and idiosyncratic to their bad-boy image, are part of what makes Guns n' Roses such a diverse, superb group. The end gleams just as bright as the intro, and everything in the middle is perfectly worthwhile--and that is a vast understatement. It's difficult to follow Child, but \\"You're Crazy\\" is the song given that position. This song, like \\"Out ta' Get Me\\" would be better if it was on another album, but it's still a good song, definetly enjoyable, albeit only enjoyable. Next is the only filler on the whole album, \\"Anything Goes.\\" I enjoy the guitar part, but the lyrics aren't very strong with the exception of the opening verse. The chorus is not well written. Lastly we are brought to the six minute plus \\"Rocket Queen,\\" a song that showcases voice distortion the right way. Solid lyrics, and a simple yet fitting guitar part make this an appropriate closer for one of the best albums of all time.  <br />  In addition to solid songs all around, some details that put make this CD great, not good. First of all are Axl's vocal overdubs allowing him to sing backup with his signature style, but in the foreground with one of the many other dimensions of his voice. Squealing guitar solos from Slash are wonderful, (he's my favorite guitarist) but I'm also glad to see Izzy ALWAYS strong on rhythm, and occasionally on lead. Good drumming adds to the mix, and the bands entirely \\"F&*@ 'em all\\" attitude is what really makes GnR the best band of the 80's. In my opinion, no one better has come along since them.
B0002IU988|4.0|This CD could have been so much better had Scott Stapp been doing the singing. I just don't like this guys voice, sounds too generic for a band of former Creeder's. He hasn't got the range of Scott, but I guess that's just me. Come back please Scott, I wanna here some more Christian stuff.
1400032717|5.0|I read this book in a 4 hour sitting. <br /> <br />This is one of the most amazing books I have read.  Mark Haddon has successfully potrayed a highly intelligent, yet innocent and autistic boy in Christoper, the book's hero. <br /> <br />The book has inspired me to think how our everyday lives seemed not too distant from Christopher's.  In everyone of us, there lives a Christopher, one who screams when we can't face the pressure, who temporarily blocks out events or surroundings when there is too much to comprehend, who \\"runs away\\" from problems rather than facing them... <br /> <br />Despite his autism, Christopher is sometimes more mature and grown up than many of us - his thoughts, his innocence, his actions and his understanding of life.  Christopher has really tugged at my heart strings, and I salute Mark Haddon for fleshing out our lives through Christopher's...
B00003CXCT|1.0|There is no way I'm going to purchase this bogus DVD set containing the \\"special edition\\" movies. I have my VHS tapes of the original, TRUE versions backed up several times, so I'll enjoy those until Lucas comes to his senses and releases those as well. That egotystical cow could have easily put both on this DVD set. He's not getting my cash for this insult.
B000286RKW|2.0|Look, I like Marty Scorsese more than most people.  He has made some of the best movies of the past 50 years, like \\"The Age of Innocence\\".  But the only good thing about \\"Goodfellas\\" is Lorraine Bracco's performance as a strong-willed Karen Hill (they should've called the movie \\"GoodGal\\"! Wink!). <br /> <br />Joe Pesci won the Oscar for an overly-showy role (I think it was the \\"Whaddya mean I'm funny?\\" bit that won it for him).  The statue should've gone to Graham Greene in \\"Dances with Wolves\\", which rightfully beat \\"Goodfellas\\" for Best Picture and Best Director.  Marty deserved an Oscar for \\"The Age of Innocence\\" but unfortunately wasn't nominated that year.  Costner's movie was recognized as the heart and soul of 1990, while \\"BADfellas\\" became synonymous with the horrendous ordeal America was unwittingly about to endure:  The Clinton Administration. <br /> <br />Lots of ink has been spilled over the violence in this movie.  Yes, it is violent, but Marty would outdo even himself with 1995's \\"Casino\\".  Remember, \\"Taxi Driver\\" was once controversial for it's violence, but these days any child over 8 can recite Travis Bickle's \\"You talkin' to me?\\" routine.  \\"Goodfellas\\" dubiously opened up the floodgates for heathens like Quentin Tarantino to turn the silver screen red.  My problem is, as with Tarantino's work, the violent acts in \\"Goodfellas\\" are celebrated.  The consequences are not explored. <br /> <br />The other troubling aspect of this visually-interesting film is the cocaine that Henry Hill becomes involved in.  The second half of the film is obsessed with drugs, and practically endorses dealing narcotics as a valid way of making a living!  Scorsese should've known better.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Someone i know once described this album to me as being \\"dreamy\\", and that is exactly what it is, just listen to songs such as 'Hummer', 'Spaceboy', 'Soma' and 'Luna'. After 11 years i must have listened to this album over a 1000 times from start to finish and it still remains one of my all-time favorite records. Enough said.
B00005JMUA|1.0|...'bout the birds and the bees, and the flowers and the trees, and the moon up above, yada, yada, yada.  We all know the song, just like we all know the Kill Bill saga is one long violent, bloody, amoral MESS.  I promised myself and my Lord that I would not watch volume 2, but my friend's daughters assured me that the second half was far superior.  <br /> <br />Friends and fans (of my reviews! Unite!), let me tell you this movie is even more violent and disturbing than the first one.  I'm glad I ate light before watching, because I surely would've tossed my cookies in a literal sense when watching a woman trapped underground in a coffin!  Yeah, it's that bad. <br /> <br />This movie sets the feminist movement (which I'm part of, and proud of it) backwards about 15-20 years.  Uma Thurman has been celebrated for becoming a walking skeleton.  Sure, she mastered a rare form of ninjitsu while preparing for a physically demanding role.  But it doesn't make her a \\"role-model,\\" just ask Mary-Kate Olsen.
B002O3Z50Q|3.0|Putting aside all the mythological characters and even many of the historical facts, TROY is an epic film that attempts to display the Trojan War in less than three hours. Seeing that the Trojan War lasted around a decade, it's almost an insane feat. However, for the most part, the movie works. There's a lot of fierce fighting and the political underpinnings around the war are examined. This was a film that probably did have a cast of thousands and the 1000 ships sailing from Greece to Troy along with the conflicts that follow are spectacular.<br /><br />However, the movie could have been much better. The basic story about the Trojan War has been altered. That in itself isn't that big of a deal, but most of the things that have been changed weren't changed to make the movie flow smoother or even to make the movie more interesting. Instead, they've were changed to accommodate star Brad Pitt and give him more screen time. Normally, that wouldn't bother me much, but Pitt has been horribly miscast as Achilles. By changing the story to give him more screen time, the filmmakers have made the film less interesting and appealing.<br /><br />Another one of the big stars of the movie is Orlando Bloom. Bloom portrays the love struck Paris--you know, the guy who steals Helen away from her husband in Greece and takes her to Troy. Though Bloom looks and fits into his role better than Pitt, Bloom too, is miscast. Paris might have been somewhat of a whiner and even a bit of a wimp compared to his brother Hector, but he probably wasn't the pretty boy that he's made to be in the film (and if I'm not mistaken, according to the &#34;real&#34; story Paris doesn't survive the invasion of the city either).<br /><br />The real star of this movie and an actor who continues to be overlooked and underrated is Eric Bana. Bana is dead on as Hector, Troy's great warrior and the one man who could have bested Achilles had he not been so invincible. Bana's portrayal is perfect and would have been even had the movie been better cast.<br /><br />Overall TROY is a somewhat enjoyable film that attempts to recapture the spirit of the grand epic movie rather than tell a historically accurate description of the Trojan War. There's a little romance, some decent sword and sandal combat scenes, and a lot of pretty faces. In short, your basic Hollywood movie.ven had the movie been better cast.<br /><br />Overall TROY is a somewhat enjoyable film that attempts to recapture the spirit of the grand epic movie rather than tell a historically accurate description of the Trojan War.

B0002S94BG|5.0|So, ten years later, we have a spruced up re-release of what some people would call one of the greatest albums of the 90's (I would be one of those people).  Most reading this have probably already heard Grace and have a copy of it.  So the real question is, is it worth getting the Legacy Edition? <br /> <br />The First Disc: <br />What can I say that hasn't already been said?  It's magical.  I couldn't tell any difference between this remaster and the original. <br /> <br />The Second Disc: <br />The second disc starts of with \\"Forget Her\\", an oft-bootlegged tune that was cut from Grace in favor of \\"So Real\\".  \\"Forget Her\\" is gorgeous, although I understand the personal decision Jeff made not to release it.  What follows is a slew of rare tracks - some can be found on EPs, promo CD's (and one from the First Love, Last Rites soundtrack), but some are completely new.  Amazon's track listing is incorrect, by the way - the second track is an alternate take of \\"Dream Brother\\" - it's between \\"Forget Her\\" and \\"Lost Highway\\", for a total of 12 tracks. <br /> <br />Stuff like \\"Alligator Wine\\" makes you smile, when you hear Jeff laughing and fooling around in the studio.  There is a version of \\"Alligator Wine\\" that Jeff did on WMFU that's floating around somewhere, and which I like more...on this he forgets the words and starts ad-libbing, and I don't think the drum beat really adds anything. <br /> <br />This disc will probably get JB completists like me riled up after they hunted down stuff like Peyote Radio Theatre, or the First Love, Last Rites soundtrack, but there is still plenty of stuff they didn't put on here.  There's his awesome collaboration with the Jazz Passengers (actually I'm surprised they didn't put \\"Jolly Street\\" on here) and his work with Chris Dowd.   <br /> <br />In what is sure to disappoint many fans who read the Columbia press release, \\"Strawberry Street\\" is NOT on here.  I don't know what happened.  You can find a bootleg taken from his Babylon Dungeon demos if you look hard enough, but it would have been nice to hear a high-quality version of it. <br /> <br />The DVD: <br />The DVD has the original music videos for \\"Grace\\", \\"Last Goodbye\\", and \\"So Real\\".  They are all pristine and much better than anything you could download.  They also included a \\"video\\" for \\"Eternal Life\\", but it's just the road version of the song poorly synced to low-quality footage of his performance in Chicago (which can be found on the Live in Chicago DVD).  There's also a video for (an edited down) \\"Forget Her\\", which has some random Jeff footage - some has been in the many documentaries about him, most of it new. <br /> <br />Also on the DVD is \\"The Making of Grace\\".  When it started I was disappointed, because the first few minutes are just the Grace EPK (which is also on the Live in Chicago DVD).  But then!  New interviews with Steve Berkowitz, Andy Wallace, and the bandmembers (you finally get to hear Mick talk!).  Also some new footage of Jeff in the studio, Jeff live, and Jeff talking about the record.  Good stuff.  It's about 25 minutes long. <br /> <br /> <br />The Verdict: <br />If you're a fan of Jeff, this is a must-buy.  Even if you've gotten all of the released rare tracks, downloaded the music videos (which haven't been *officially* available until now), and have the Live in Chicago DVD, the *totally new* recordings and the new footage in \\"The Making of Grace\\" make it worth the price of admission.  If you haven't seeked out those rare-but-released recordings, then this is a no-brainer - it will all be new to you. <br /> <br />Although the new stuff/old stuff ratio isn't as great as the Legacy Edition of Live at Sin-e (which I'd highly recommend as well), it's still solid and still worth getting.  Hopefully in a few years we can look forward to a Legacy Edition of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, but until then I'll keep my fingers crossed.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|THE BOURNE SUPREMACY begins two years after THE BOURNE IDENTITY left off. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been quietly living in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie. He still suffers from amnesia and can't remember much about his past except for snippets that come to him in dreams. He writes these things down in a journal trying to piece together his forgotten and shattered past. Meanwhile, back in Berlin, an expensive and important CIA operation is blotched when some important files are stolen and a key informant is killed. The killer &#34;leaves&#34; a fingerprint behind and the print turns out to belong to Jason Bourne. This leads Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to begin a worldwide search for Bourne to bring him in for questioning. Back in India, Jason and Marie plan their get away from a Russian hit man, but things turn tragic. Two years ago Bourne told the CIA to leave him alone. He thinks they're after him again and he begins a mission to show the intelligent agency just who really is supreme.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a worthy sequel to the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY. The movie continues the story and as the film develops, we learn more not only about Bourne's past, but about other characters from the original film, too. The acting is extremely well done, especially for an action/espionage movie. Especially noteworthy is Matt Damon who portrays Bourne perfectly. One of the tag lines for the film &#34;Matt Damon is Jason Bourne&#34; isn't just a cool saying.<br /><br />The only major negative I found with the movie was quick cuts from one scene to another. I don't know why this has become the popular thing to do with fighting movies nowadays, but instead of making a film or movie more interesting, it proves to be a big distraction. It leaves the audience wondering exactly what went on and unless it's a thinking movie, you should never leave an audience wondering what went happened. But other than that, it's all good.
0930289455|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT story!!! (which is saying a lot, considering I'm a Marvel fan. At least I was, untill they ruined the continuity!) <br />Without spoiling it for ya'll, This REALLY reveals a LOT about the Joker.His origin (at least the way he remembers it.) It also shows you what a PSYCHO he is. We all knew he was crazy,but maybe in a \\"loveable\\" kinda way. This book explores the depth of his insanity.Anyhow,I recommend this book.
B000003TA4|4.0|I won't presume to tell you how much you'll like this album. I like it to a 4 star degree personally but I've noticed that people have different tastes in music. All you can do is say how much you like something really. OK, if you are looking for advice this is a very good album for anyone who wants an introduction to grunge or who likes rock with a more raw sound. <br /> <br />The real reason I'm posting this review is in response to a review by LouisLoius88 entitled \\"This is not really a review of the album.\\" It's brilliant, you see, because he has read a review by Avril_Lavigne#1fan called \\"A legend.\\" This is a clearly toungue in cheek review and LL88 has attacked the writer as if it were real! Superb! Sorry LL88, but I do suggest you read the rest of Avril_Lavigne#1fan's reviews, you'll probably enjoy them a lot more. That goes for anyone who's read this, although they are quite insulting to fans of the bands reviewed. Take them with a pinch of salt and enjoy.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Seeing this film again after a few years, I remain convinced that this is the greatest American animated film of all time.  The story, the music, the voice acting, the animation all combine to create an intricately woven, full-bodied legend that Disneys more recent efforts (e.g. Hunchback and Tarzan) don't come close to matching.  Even the classic Disney's seem creaky and thin by comparison. <br /> <br />The story is very simple and is basically an aglomeration of familiar Western legends - Hamlet and Richard III from Shakespeare, Joseph and the Prodigal Son from the Bible, etc.  Mufasa, the Lion King, is murdered by his jealous and imbalanced brother, who then frightens the king's son and rightful heir into exile.  The exiled Simba grows up with a couple friends whose theme in life is \\"Hakuna Matata\\" (which roughly translates into \\"why worry?\\").  Meanwhile, the deranged brother has ruined the kingdom, so it's up to Simba to return to set things right and claim his rightful place as King. <br /> <br />Such a description does not do justice to the underlying structure of the film - there are several themes running through the story, punctuated by the Rice/John songs (the \\"Circle of Life\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\" are the most prominent) that give the film a depth and richness that allows it to rise above it genre to become a very satisfying repeat experience.  That's not to say that kids will not enjoy the film - there are ample gross-out jokes, for example (Timone munching grubs and worms, Pumba's problem with flatulence, etc.).  Mufasa's death scene is probably too intense for pre-schoolers, so be careful not to show it to really young children. <br /> <br />This DVD edition is quite good.  As mentioned by others, the extras do contain a little too much Disney cheerleading, although generally they are quite interesting.  The games are pretty lame - why do they include these things???  In addition, navigation is not straightforward, but it's not bad.  The directors/producer commentary is well worth listening to.  Finally, it's curious that not a single actor was invited to participate.  With voices supplied by the likes of interesting and thoughtful actors (e.g., James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Robert Guillome), it's very disappointing that no interviews with them were included in the extras. <br /> <br />Because of the quality of the film, and the fantastic quality of the video (and apparently the sound, although my system can't appreciate it), this DVD is highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I awaited the release of this movie with great anticipation.  The first two movies gave a real impression of being in the UK.  Having been on assignment in London for a week just prior to this film's release I was greatly anticipating feeling that flavor again after I returned home to the States. <br /> <br />What I struggle to place a finger on is the lack of English 'feel' the movie actually had.  As soon as Harry, Hermione and Ron got on the Hogwart's Express it felt like they were coming to Hogwarts in North America.  The only thing I can think of is that Cuaron's bias as a North American bled through into the movie.  From the changes in the Quidditch uniforms from the first two movies to this one, to the changes in character clothing (lack of the UK prep school uniform look, toward the North American casual) it just felt... wrong. <br /> <br />Overall good movie, and well done with the young actors adding to their collective acting chops, but still left me wanting more richness.  David(?) Thewliss steals this movie as a tremendously well cast Professor Lupin.  I missed the original Dumbledore, though the replacement was passable.
B00005JN2F|5.0|This movie held me in its grip from the first scene.  I didn't see Identity but I don't think it would have mattered---Supremacy stands on its own.  The non-stop action twists and turns you but never leaves you hanging. And the numerous locales in India, Russia and Europe add so much to the overall realism of this fast-paced thriller. <br /> <br />And of course, Matt Damon gives us, in both himself and the film, another winner.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|The CD gives a new approach to the idea of rap. We're a melting pot, and the music industry has evolved, way to go the D12 to stick out their neck and try something new. Those of us who have followed the evolution and history of music (more than just rap my friends, we're talking centuries here) know that chanes in the genra like this can makes huge differences in a specific demographic's pop culture, and \\"pop culture\\" CAN mean rap, as defined buy what may or may not be popular at the time. give the CD a try and you might be listening to a change of musical diffferencial history.  <br /> <br />And, you don't have to call other people stupid if they don't agree. Luckily, that's why music stores have many sections, not just rap. The mathmatical series  (aka: why it sounds good) of  music comes together with DIVERSITY.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Waking the Fallen is the best CD ever.  From the drumming solos to the guitar solos to the singing to the screaming, you will love every song on the disc with no need to skip any.  Every song on this cd is awesome, i Recommend EVERYONE to go buy it. it is totally worth it.
0060934913|1.0|Anthony Bourdain is the annoying guest at a party who bores those willing to listen with the intricacies of his job in unnecessary detail.  I was one of those guests willing to listen finishing the entire book deciding it was worhwhile for only one chapter.  The chapter to which I am referring, is written behind the wizards curtain.  The reader learns why not to order fish on Monday and that the rolls in most restaurants are recycled.  These are gross revelations and I am better for knowing them. After this stop which occurs early on in the memoir, the author laborously details his rise to the acme of culinary expression.  Some of the accounts are humorous but only in the way one would chuckle at the exploits of fraternity hazing.  Snorting lines of cocaine, chain smoking, and mysogyny are funny only in a pitiable sense.  These stories may seem like self deprecating apologies but they are not presented with such compunction.  The author is proud of his indomitability, his hands scarred with kitchen abuse.  He even claims in the last sentence that he wouldn't have missed the experience for the world.  The author is certainly proud of his own nastiness and that of his cronies; if others do not understand they can get out of the kitchen.  He presents his daily routine as a chef in exacting detail in a chapter titled expectedly enough \\"A day in the Life...\\"  In this chapter he allows the reader a glimpse in to the draconian requirements of his job implying that it is beyond the scope of normal expereince worthy of publishing and admiration.  What is lost on the author is that many jobs are replete with comical characters, unendurable routine, and moments of frenzied activity.  I am sure the waiters whom he loathes would have just as interesting a tale to write.  However, like the waiters I feel alienated by Anthony Bourdain and prefer to stay out of the kitchen.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|For some inexplicable reason,when this movie was in the theaters, I had very little desire to see it and decided to pass on it.<br /><br />When it was eventually, released on DVD, I still passed on it whenever I saw an available copy in the new releases section.<br /><br />The other night, while flipping through channels, I came across it on one of the movie channels I get on cable. I was about to switch channels when I decided for whatever reason to give it a couple of more minutes.<br /><br />Those couple of minutes rapidly turned into the entire movie and I can't recall when I have seen a movie - without action or drama or special effects - that I enjoyed so much as Lost In Translation.<br /><br />Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is a wonderful story about the very special bond that develops between two very different people who happen to be in Tokyo.<br /><br />Bill Murray gives a stand out performance and maybe the best of his career as an aging American movie star who is in Tokyo - instead of doing a meaningful play somewhere else - to film a television commercial, which will pay him $2.0 million.<br /><br />Scarlett Johanssen is a young married woman - she was 18 or 19 playing a woman in her early 20's - who has accompanied her photographer husband -Giovanni Ribisi - to Tokyo. He's there to film a music video and Scarlett, because her husband is busy working, is essentially left to her own devices to pass the time.<br /><br />Lost In Translation tells the story of the meeting and relationship, which develops between these two very different people. However, it is told in such an honest and life-like way that we forget we're actually watching a movie. What we see on the screen developing between these too characters is very special and the viewer comes to know and like these characters. In fact, you almost wish this movie wouldn't end.<br /><br />I had heard the \\"hype\\" about Scarlett Johanssen - the \\"It\\" girl and perhaps that factor alone is what initially put me off about this movie. Normally, I am very skeptical about this type of label and rarely does the individual actually live up to the expectations the media creates.<br /><br />However, in this instance, every wonderful accolade that is bestowed upon her is well deserved. She is enchanting as this neglected wife who is a recent graduate in philosphy (\\"alot of dough in that racket\\" as Bill wonderfully remarks to her..!). Her expressive eyes and wonderful and spontaneous laugh are so real and so evocative that it's impossible not to be drawn to her character. I find that she is able to convey more feeling with just a look or smile than most actresses can with an encyclopedia of script.<br /><br />And you can't say enough good things about Bill Murray, who plays this world-weary and throughly likeable middle aged man who's been married for a quarter of a century to a woman. Throughout the movie, Bill will call his wife and you get a real sense that the passion and excitement of his marriage has long disappeared. His telephone conversations with his wife are very short and she seems to have very little interest in her husband's stay in Tokyo. it's no wonder that he finds himself drawn to this kindred spirit - Scarlett - who is half his age.<br /><br />I'm pleased that Sofia didn't succumb to the cliche to develop a sexual relationship between these two. There was, of course, real affection and trust between them, however, you sense that their relationship is far too special to sacrifice it for a \\"roll in the hay\\".<br /><br />Since that intial viewing, I have seen this movie several times on my cable movie network and I find myself drawn to it like a moth to the flame.<br /><br />This is a very rare and special movie and after having seen it, I now understand why this movie was almost universally hailed as a tour-de-force by the critics.<br /><br />For anybody interested in human behaviour and interaction - which should be us all, it should be mandatory viewing.<br/><br />A very special film and one that I would not hsitate to recommend / buy.ould be mandatory viewing. <br /> <br />A very special film and one that I would not hsitate to recommend / buy.
B00005JN2X|5.0|I sort of thought they didn't make movies as good as this anymore. In a way, Collateral is nostalgic, recalling a time when character development meant more than giving a character a wife with a minor speaking part. In a way, though, too, it's the best kind of modern, with terrific setpieces, editing and action. <br /> <br />Slightly eccentric casting pays off in the case of Cruise and Fox, one easily believable as a suave killer who could pass for a businessman, the other equally believable as an ordinary guy with an acute sense of humor. In the end, I think it's not just that they pull off these performances in spite of themselves; but that Cruise's arrogance helps him to channel Vincent, and that Fox brings out the cab driver's sense of humor as one of his defining characteristics. <br /> <br />The strong performances by the two main characters and the solid, clever script are the main attractions, but also worth noticing is the beautiful photography; it works so well with its urban location, which always seems like more than a backdrop. Then there's a scene in a dance club called Fever which rivals the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill for sheer choreography and slickness. There's something about seeing Tom Cruise effortlessly break a man's leg with a stomp kick which alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Thematically, Collateral is interesting, although Cruise's Philosophical Villain may seem overplayed to those very familiar with such devices. Still, the idea of a doubled character (central to Alfred Hitchcock's work), of moral ambiguity and of a Stockholm Syndrome-like sympathy with Cruise's character, all come off very well. Even at the end, when it seems to degenerate into a simple action picture, the themes are still subtly operating, and are strongest in the last scene. <br /> <br />I'm wondering if this film is destined to become a sleeper hit. Even though critics and audiences seem to love it, it was released with little fanfare in a slow season for movies, and didn't do exceptionally well in the box offices. I would say, though, that it rivals any film like it put out in this decade, and deserves to become a classic in the line of Chinatown and A Touch of Evil.
0783225857|5.0|This is probably my very favorite movie - the one film that I would have to have if I was stranded on a desert island that, fortunately, had electric outlets, a televison and a DVD / VCR.<br /><br />In a time when we've all become accustomed to these panoramic epics which command a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and seek to spell bind the audience with breath taking special effects, To Kill A Mockingbird succeeds without having to resort to any of these.<br /><br />This movie, filmed appropriately in black and white, tells the simple story of Atticus Finch, an attorney in the south of the 1930's who is raising his two children, Scout and Jeb. The story is seen through the eyes of Scout, a young girl, who is narrating the story many years later as a grown woman. And this is one of the important elements of this film. To Kill A Mockingbird is seen from a child's perspective and, as such, men like Atticus and the poor black man charged with the crime, Tom Robinson are seen as very honourable men (which is what they were.!!) almost wearing white hats while the evil people in the movie - the woman wrongfull accusing Tom of rape and her white, trailer trash father - are thoroughly despicable individuals more to be pitied than to be hated.<br /><br />The movie's focal point - and it certainly was a very powerful one in 1963 when this movie was made - concerned Atticus Finch's defense of a black man who had wrongfully been charged with the sexual assault of a white woman, a crime in the 1930's south that usually bypassed the courts entriely and went directly to the nearest tree which had a limb big enough to throw a noose over.<br /><br />This movie, of course, addresses racism and it must have opened alot of eyes in the 1960's when it was made in terms of addressing the progress, or lack thereof, that had been made in the intervening 30 years.<br /><br />But more than that, it was very much a movie about growing up and how we saw the world and our parent(s) and adults and good and evil. The conclusions we came to and how the events of our youth shaped our lives and made us the people that we are today. It showed us, for example, that the boogey man \\"Boo Radley\\"- wonderfully played by a young Robert Duval - was not so scary when you understood the real \\"boogeyman\\" was the flesh and blood father of the woman who cried rape.<br /><br />Needless to say, Gregory Peck, who won the Best Actor award for his incredible performance of the decent Atticus Finch, was riveting. In a very low key and understated way, Atticus quietly exemplified all of the best qualities an individual could possess - honour, honesty, self-respect.<br /><br />This wonderful movie was based on Harper Lee's best selling Pulitzer prize winning novel. Surprisingly, Harper Lee never published anything more of significance after this book. In retrospect, how could you possibly follow up \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". I think it would have been comparable to following the Beatles after their initial Ed Sullivan appearance.<br /><br />This movie is one of those rare adaptations that actually adhered exclusively to the book and, as a result, was an artistic and commercial success. It's rare for a movie to ever approach the book in terms of quality (look at the movies based on Tom Clancey novels..!!).<br /><br />Another wonderful contribution to this film was the soundtrack. The almost haunting quality of the music, coupled with the black and white cinematography, created a wonderful mood - both during the film's ligher moments as well as the terrifying moments(as seen through the child's perspective). It's a beautiful soundtrack and certainly merits inclusion in your collection.<br /><br />This movie had a significant and lasting impact on me as an 11 year old seeing it for the first time. And many yearslater, it can still convey the same feelings in me that I felt back then. There's a very good reason why the book is considered mandatory reading in many American schools.<br /><br />If you're a lover of great films, then this movie is essential viewing.!

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator marks the return of those epic movies about the Roman Empire of the 50's and 60's i.e. Spartacus, Ben Hur that seemed bigger than life. It is a grand spectacle of a movie that contains amazing fight and electrifiying battle scenes (think about the opening 15 minutes of the movie..!!) as well as superlative performances from not only Russell Crowe, who richly deserved his Best Actor award, but from an assortment of wonderful British actors i.e. Richard Harris, David Hemming, Oliver Reed.<br /><br />Gladiator tells the story of Rome's most decorated soldier / general - Maximus. Maximus is loved by Richard Harris - Marcus Aurelius Caesar - who sees qualities in Maximus - strength, honour - that he does not see in his own son, Commodous (a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix).<br /><br />When Commodous hears that his father is dying and will not be bequeathing the title of Caesar to him, but instead handing over the management of Rome to his most trusted general, Commodous murders his father and decides to execute Maximus for treason - not recognizing the treacherous Commodous as the new Caesar. In addition, he also decides to have Maximus' wife and son crucified as well.<br /><br />Maximus escapes his executioners and escapes to his home, only to find his family murdered and his home burned to the ground. Shortly thereafter, he is found by Oliver Reed and banished to Reed's gladiator school.<br /><br />The rest of this epic movie follows Crowe's ascent to \\"gladiator superstardom\\" while thirsting for revenge against Commodus, the man who killed his family.<br /><br />Russell Crowe was made for this role. He commands much of the time on the screen and it's impossible to take your eyes off of him. Prior to his many fights in the colliseum, Crowe is like a focussed but caged animal just waiting to spring into life. It doesn't matter how much the odds are against him, Crowe is relentless in his desire to live to eventually get his revenge.<br /><br />He's a natural leader of other men and it's remarkable to see him exert his leadership skills over the other gladiators who have also been captured and enslaved into this life. Crowe quickly gains \\"superstar\\" stature amongst the Romans who flock to the Colliseum to see him and this creates a problem for the Emperor, who sees the threat that Crowe poses, but can no longer just have him killed for fear of offending the Roman citizenry.<br /><br />Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. What sets this movie apart is that it manages to perfectly blend sweeping action scenes and great computer effects with a wonderful story and magnificent performances from both the leading and supporting cast.It never allows the special effects or grandeur of the scenery overshadow the basic storytelling of a slave / gladiator who is taking on the most powerful man in the world. Too many Hollywood films rely on the millions of dollars that they're able to throw at the digital and special effects and hope that this alone will salvage the movie (I disliked the Matrix movies immensely precisely for this reason.!)<br /><br />This movie essentially tells a story that may not be entirely original, but it is told in an honest and forthright manner and is believable. Maximus is a decent man who is committed to a singleness of purpose - whether it is destroying the germanic army in the opening scene. Or exacting his revenge on the cowardly emperour who murdered his family.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the efforts of the film's director, Ridley Scott. Best known for Blade Runner and Alien, Scott has managed to create an incredible canvas that conjures up the majesty that must have been ancient Rome. Between his vision - and Crowe's performance - they succeeded on a level that is not very often acheived.<br /><br />It's no surprise that this movie successfully managed to be both a commercial and artisitic success and will appeal to both men and women.<br /><br />Highly recommended.mmended.
B0000508U6|5.0|99% of my CD collection is circa 1965-1985, so those more \\"mature\\" rockers will know where I'm coming from.  However, the first time I heard \\"Clocks\\" on the radio, I figured any band capable of producing that sound was worth a look. I picked up \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" followed by \\"Parachutes\\" a day later. This is simply excellent work that rises so far above the mediocrity of today's pop music. Totally, totally refreshing.     For all you \\"forty-somethings\\" out there who may be disenchanted with the state of today's music, check out Coldplay. You won't be disappointed.
B000069CWE|3.0|I'm obsessed with Linkin Park. I bought this album for the soul reason that it's by LP.  <br /> <br />This album has more of a rap/hip-hop feel than Hybrid Theory. I don't generally like that type of music, but this is an exception. And it still sounds somewhat like rock music. One thing that I dislike about Reanimation, is that most songs feature other artists; I prefer when the vocals are simply Mike and Chester. Speaking of Mike and Chester, they are both really great on this album, along with the rest of the band. So basically, I'm neutral about this album. <br /> <br />The best tracks (in my opinion) are Frgt/10, Wth&#62;You, My&#62;Dsmbr, By_Myslf, Kyur4 th Ich, and Rnw@y. Heh. I'm not good with favorites. <br /> <br />I would reccomend this album to Linkin Park fans, and rap/hip hop fans. But if you're not into those mentioned just now, I wouldn't buy it if I were you.
B00003CXCT|4.0|You know, most people want you to believe that these DVDs will be nothing like the originals.  The originals have heart, they say.  I say this, these ones have the same story, the same heart, and the same morals/values that the original ones.  Who are you to complain when someone adds something to make it better.   <br /> <br />These DVDs will show the truth nature of Star Wars because it will allow people of my generation to see it, because, let's face it, we all hate vhs.  I looked at the list of the extras and I must say that I am extremely impressed.  To those who say that this DVD makes the Star Wars saga extinct and dead to them, I say that they should just appreciate fine work.  Thank you Mr. Lucas, I have been waiting a long time and this shows that thousands of emails by me did not go unanswered.
B00005JNEI|5.0|A TRUE patriot has loyalty to their country and its values and principles.  Having loyalty to your country is NOT the same as having loyalty to your government.  I am loyal to this country and I LOVE my country.  However, we are losing our country.  We are losing our freedoms.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is an effort to reverse this current trend.  The film appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections.  <br />How come the Bush administration lowered taxes AND went to war in Iraq?  Just something to think about.  That is all Fahrenheit 9/11 is aiming for - just for people to THINK about this stuff.  <br />You are not required to believe anything.  That is the basis of a FREE country.  However, since you have the luxury of living in a democracy, you should at least shoulder the responsibility of educating yourself.  Otherwise, you might as well live in a country where all the decisions are made for you, because you are wasting a precious gift.

When the DVD set came out, I bought it just for the heck of it (I'd heard that it was pretty good) and then proceeded to drive my girlfriend crazy by watching it every chance I could find. (I think I went through all the episodes inside of 3 days.) Needless to say, I love this show! <br /> <br />On the surface, it's a natural... I like westerns and s-f, among other things. But that's only the surface. The appeal is in the originality - Whedon and Co. have created a unique future universe, and one which in its own way is very real. More importantly, the characters come across as real living, breathing people. Part of that is the brilliance of the writing, and part of it is the brilliance of the acting. <br /> <br />What more can I say that over 1000 others haven't already said? If you buy this DVD set I hope you end up loving this wonderful show as much as I do. And I can't wait for \\"Serenity\\" the movie and the next chapter in the story! <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|Even if you hate Bush, the Iraq war and any conservative ideas, this movie is still crap. I spent the my money at the theater so I could at least talk about it. Goebbels would be proud of Moore and his \\"movie\\" and that is the best thing I can think to say about it.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I've been enjoying Nightwish since they published the Oceanborn album, and have to admit that this album is both heavier and more orchestral than the earlier ones.     This one takes a few more times to listen to in order to get into the album, but it rewards the listener more deeply.     If you like Nightwish, it is 80/20 that you like this one. The 20 is since some people like less orchestration and/or the heavy riffs on this album.     P.S.    It's interesting that we have all these bash reviews amongst the real ones. One could imagine that it would be easy to write a negative review with analysis on what is lacking or wrong, but instead we get these hate flames.    P.P.S An earlier review commented that 17 used on sale said it all.. Currently there are 15 \\"Used or new\\" on sale by individual sellers, of which actually 3 are used and 12 new. Of the used ones both seller are sellers with abt. 700 sales. Says it all !

B000062YAZ|4.0|This is an amazing album.  Get's off to a great start with angel of death, super fast and has an insane break down.  classic.  as for the moron who reviewed this last, bernard, learn what metal is before you start writing reviews on it, moron.  anyways this album is classic slayer although my personal favorite is south of heaven, better production and sound overall.  slay your soul.
B00005JNEI|5.0|You will notice that most one star reviews of the films assert lies within the film Fahrenheit 9/11, without being able to identify any of these lies: It's a shame that they can't, because Michael Moore has stated repeatedly, to numerous publications around the world, that he will give $10,000 to whoever can prove he's lied: And so far, he has yet to pay so much as a single cent out.  <br /> <br />This is not surprising, when you consider most of those critical of the film haven't even seen it, or much less know much about Moore himself. The film doesn't refer to September 11th? There is harrowing sound footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 of one of the towers being struck, the audience left in the dark to listen to the people's terrified screams, and imagine the horror they must be witnessing. He's only made two films? His first film was actually \\"Roger And Me\\"...  <br /> <br />Nor will any of the critics dare answer Fahrenheit 9/11's most powerful and closing imagery: that of Lila Lipscomb. A woman who patriotically hangs the Stars and Stripes outside her home every morning. A woman who encourages the local children of poverty-stricken Flint to enlist in order in order to secure a future from themselves. But also a woman who is reduced to collapsing in tears outside the White House, by someone so lacking in dignity that they'd accuse a grieving mother, an inch from her face, of lying about having a son killed in Iraq. <br /> <br />And at current rates of losses, there will be 1,000 Lila Lipscomb's close to the anniversary of September 11th this year. Propaganda? No, the simple, awful truth, irrespective of whether you accept the earlier, more Bush focused part of the film or not. Her son, Michael Pedersen IS dead. As are the uncounted tens of thousands of sons and daughters of Iraqi men and women too: Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us one such mother, digging through the rubble of her former home, desperately seeking her daughter who is buried under it... We see her screaming for Allah to save her, to explain what her little girl has done to deserve such a fate... and then her grief wracked mind tries to bargain for her daughters life: Why doesn't Allah kill American children instead of the children of the devoted? But if he did, would that bring her daughter back? Does killing Iraqi's bring the victims of September 11th back? Or does the circle of violence just continue to claim ever more victims? <br /> <br />This IS the reality of War. Fahrenheit 9/11 simply reminds you of it, and asks you if it was really worth paying in this War's particular case.  <br />And this is supposed to be the essence of what Democracy actually is: To inform the people of the true state of affairs, and ask them to make choices upon what they would prefer it to be. Screaming at grieving mothers about lying, or putting your fingers in your ears so you can't hear the laments of those who must dig amongst their homes for what's left of their family is the true Anti-Americanism, because it attempts to deny the right of people to make an informed choice. And that is really what the One Star Warriors here are engaged in: They would prefer for you to not know the true reality of War, for fear that you will make a different choice regarding it than themselves.  <br />But EVERYONE should be required to see the true face of what is occurring in Iraq, and what is still occurring in Iraq:  Because what occurs there means that many, many mothers will never see their own children's faces again... and we owe it to them, we owe it to Democracy and America, to be as informed as possible before accepting a choice which has such a high price for those involved.  <br /> <br />So, see this film... not because it's a masterpiece (it's not: the first half in particular is ham-handed in style) or because it's particularly funny (it isn't, depressingly not at times) or even because of the controversy surrounding it; but because it gives a voice to people like Lila Lipscomb and tens of thousands like her. See it, because it's your democratic duty to do so.  <br />
B00003CXA3|5.0|This work was the most powerful movie of William Friedkin . Supported by a very well elaborated script , high caliber tension and first rate cast .<br /><br />Fernando Rey this unforgettable spanish actor plays the role of the master brain of the operation . Gene Hackman was in his second best film (after The conversation)playing the role of Popeye dole who sounds a little ridiculous but that worked out .<br /><br />The car chase in New York city streets is a classic.
0671027344|5.0|I began reading this book, thinking it would be \\"pretty good.\\" I found that I could not put it down. I had to know what was going on with Charlie. He became a part of my life. His world became my world. My emotions ran high, and I really lost myself in this book. Charlie and I are alike on so many levels it's unreal.  <br /> <br />In the book, he feels infinite while listening to the Smiths' song \\"Asleep.\\" While reading Charlie's letters, I listened to my Thrice cd nonstop. That cd makes me feel infinite. I can't listen to any of those songs now without thinking of Charlie. He touched me in a way I didn't think a fictional character ever could. He's so beautiful. *I wish someone would have told him that.*
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I first saw this movie shortly after it was released on VHS with a guitar-playing buddy of mine whom we'd nicknamed \\"Eddie\\" after Edward Van Halen. When this movie came out, Steve Vai was the guitar player in David Lee Roth's band. The plot was interesting enough, but it was the head-cutting duel at the end of the movie that was the coup de grace, the piece de resistance, and so on and so forth. Vai even looked devilish! I bought the soundtrack album and was disappointed that it only had the Ry Cooder blues stuff on it, and none of the Cooder-Vai and Vai-Vai duel. If anyone's interested, the duel and another duel that didn't make it to the movie is available on Vai's \\"Elusive Light & Sound Vol. 1\\" CD, along with some stuff he did from \\"Bill & Ted\\" and \\"Encino Man\\" and some other movies. This movie will always have a special place for me because I first watched it with a bunch of good friends during a tough time in my life. Yes, maybe some people will find fault with the plot, maybe some of the blues purists didn't like the Vai classical-metal parts of the duel, and some may just not like Ralph Macchio, but this is one of those movies that, for me, transcends all those factors and will always be a favorite. I've just about worn out a VHS copy and plan to pick up a DVD soon. And I just got the aforementioned Vai CD last week and am rapidly wearing out tracks 4-8.

076790592X|5.0|This is how Morrie Shwartz described to Ted Koppel, the way he wanted to live. It seems as though Mitch Albom saw that, and so much more in his old teacher.<br /><br />We find Mitch at a point in his life where he is basically consumed by his career. That is, until he sees \\"Nightline\\" and it features his old professor. So, every Tuesday he visits his old teacher for one final class, to work on their final thesis. Mitch finds himself admiring the way Morrie used to dance with students, how when he was so sick he missed going for that daily swim. While Morrie would enjoy life, with observations such as, \\"Age is not a competitive issue. Think of all I can be! I am every age, up to my own.\\" With life lessons such as forgiveness, and even saying goodbye. Simple pleasures in life. That's what Morrie taught. During a period in the Vietnam war, he gave all his students A's!<br /><br />This isn't a book you have to think about. It is beautiful.

B00008H2LB|5.0|I thought LPs first album was so good, i didnt see how they ever could have topped it...but i was very wrong...If you liked their first album, you should love this one. Their songs never fail to have meaning, relatable intelligent lyrics behind them, OR, a catchy jump around electronic rock beat. Best tracks are:  Figure 9.0, Nobodys Listening, & Easier to Run. Also of course, \\"Faint\\" which was released, probably my favorite song on here...one i can have on repeat for quite awhile. Every single song on here is great though, so i gave it 5 stars. Not one single track will leave you bored, and its actually one of those rare, precious albums, you can listen to the whole way through without having to contemplate whether you should skip to around to a different song.
B000002P6R|4.0|Honestly speaking, this is the band's weakest album along with being their most-hated.  A number of factors make people hate it so strongly, such as Kenney Jones's drumming not matching the kind of drumming Keith Moon did, the songs being too poppy and not rocking enough, lame lyrics, and it just being a bad period for the band in general.  Still, taken in context of everything that was going on for them during this period, it's remarkably good, esp. considering it could have been a whole lot worse.  And many people feel that if Pete had done these songs on a solo album and saved EG for the band, these songs would have been received with a whole lot more critical acclaim because of how personal and un-Wholike they are (though then they might very well have hated EG instead, which is really hypocritical).  It was my ninth Who album, and I'll admit I was really disappointed to see it in the store instead of WBN or WAY, which I'd been hoping might finally be stocked there by then.  However, I was well-grounded enough in my fandom to take a chance and buy this album I'd heard such awful things about from almost everyone, and having already been led to believe it was a piece of garbage, I was rather pleasantly surprised on my first listening.  It will never be one of my fave Who albums, but I rather like most of the songs.  Having already heard the worst, I was prepared for anything and didn't have any great expectations to be smashed, which is why I believe my reaction to it was not at all negative or disgusted.  Most of the songs do have mediocre, lame, or embarrassing lyrics, but taken in context they're not bad and are even enjoyable (or, perhaps, as a younger fan, only a bit over a year old when the album was first released, I didn't come to it with all of the baggage that made so many older fans hate it so much).<br /><br />My faves on this album are \\"YBYB\\" (which apparently more female than male fans like; most male fans seem to hate this song), \\"The Quiet One,\\" \\"Don't Let Go the Coat\\" (which I took ages to appreciate; I hated it for the longest time, until the demo version on 'Another Scoop' grew on me), \\"Daily Records,\\" and the original closer \\"Another Tricky Day,\\" which is a classic early Eighties anthem.  \\"Did You Steal My Money?\\" and \\"How Can You Do It Alone?\\" routinely top most peoples' lists of their most-hated Who songs, but I rather like them; the former is kinda cute, and the middle-eight is so poignant, and the latter song (which is like a grown-up version of \\"Pictures of Lily\\") I like because of the bagpipes.<br /><br />The Who's later albums, from WBN on, really didn't have as much thought and care put into their bonus tracks as the earlier ones did, but this one is the exception.  I don't really care for \\"I Like Nightmares,\\" but the other four are spectacular.  \\"It's in You\\" is a great rocker, and the live versions of \\"The Quiet One\\" and \\"HCYDIA?\\" also really cook.  It's interesting to note the differences between the original live genesis of \\"HCYDIA?\\" and the blander and less directly dirty version that eventually made its way onto this album; the live genesis is not only harder and more rocking but also has raunchier lyrics.  The inclusion of the group's version of Pete's solo song \\"Somebody Saved Me\\" is also a great bonus track.  You can also spot the differences between this song and the later album version; on here it's very slow and soft, whereas on 'Chinese Eyes' it's faster and a bit harder.  Overall a great remastering job on an album that most people don't think that highly of to begin with.\\" \\"Don't Let Go the Coat\\" (which I took ages to appreciate; I hated it for the longest time, until the demo version on 'Another Scoop' grew on me), \\"Daily Records,\\" and the original closer \\"Another Tricky Day,\\" which is a classic early Eighties anthem.  \\"Did You Steal My Money?\\" and \\"How Can You Do It Alone?\\" routinely top most peoples' lists of their most-hated Who songs, but I rather like them; the former is kinda cute, and the middle-eight is so poignant, and the latter song (which is like a grown-up version of \\"Pictures of Lily\\") I like because of the bagpipes. <br /> <br />The Who's later albums, from WBN on, really didn't have as much thought and care put into their bonus tracks as the earlier ones did, but this one is the exception.

0064407667|2.0|I cannot comment on this book from the POV of a child, as I am an adult.  A child might like this book ... quite frankly I don't know.  This book received some attention when it was written as a book that was encouraging children to read, along with the more clever and entertaining Harry Potter series.  Unfortunately this book, unlike Harry Potter, was written exclusively for young readers and has very little to offer to anyone older than 12.  The plot is implausible (and rather disturbing with the pedophilic overtones) and the author's didactic (and pedantic) writing style is distracting and, quite frankly, annoying.  You will be disappointed in this title if you have any expectations that it might rival Harry Potter.  If you are a child who doesn't know any better and need to choose between reading and watching television, this might be a better choice.
B000002P2W|5.0|The majority of the songs on this beautiful underrated album are like a musical suicide note, songs full of pain, turmoil, regret, and anger, over turning thirty, being depressed, not having many real friends, being unappreciated, having problems with alcohol.  Thankfully this musical suicide note wasn't fully carried out.  It's one of those underrated albums that the average person has to listen to a few times through before it really begins to sink in and to be fully appreciated and loved.  The themes on this album also aren't the type of songs that a new fan would be more into; I got it at the age of 21, and know I probably wouldn't have fully grasped and appreciated it when I was younger, as deep as I was when I was younger.  And it's also not, at least in my experience, the type of album you can just play whenever you want to because of its dark and deep texture; I usually play it when I'm not feeling well or right before I go to bed.  In other words, not for a lawn seat fan or someone just getting into the band.<br /><br />My only complaint about the album, apart from the hideous \\"Squeeze Box\\" (which I can only like and appreciate here, in its proper context on the album, lightening the heavy sad mood between \\"However Much I Booze\\" and \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\"), is the selection of bonus tracks.  The remastering team could have just remastered the album as-was instead of dredging up a bunch of songs that were just live versions of two of the songs we just heard earlier plus a live version of the hideously overplayed \\"BBE.\\"  I love the hilarious onstage dialogue, but they could have been included along with some REAL bonus tracks, or saved for an officially-released album of the Swansea show from whence they came.  The earlier albums have such great bonus tracks on them, doubling the original length of each album, but it's like the remastering team just ran out of steam or material by the time they got to WBN and the albums afterwards, and didn't put as much thought or care into selecting the bonus tracks.  If there weren't enough unreleased songs from this period, they could have just remastered it with the original ten tracks instead of giving us three tracks that are more redundant than bonus.thought or care into selecting the bonus tracks.

6305897786|5.0|Who is this thing called Mr. Evil? The answer that Johnny Depp's character finds is apparently \\"The Ninth Gate\\", as a Light-doorway is entered to find the solution. It appears to me that director Polanski knows more than he says and tries to lead the viewer from the mundane to what is behind things. That which we in the ordinary life and interests call evil is, like Depp's Corso, a blind for the seeker and his quest for answers. <br />    I love the artistic approach to the Bookman's world in all its variety and I watch this movie over and over for the mystery and thrills of hearing the forbidden discussed. If you have no seeker's soul this movie will bore you. Buy the book. But if 'mysteries' means to you something a bit more than this is a fun movie.
B000005JA8|5.0|This is really hard music to get into.  It sounds just awful on first listen, the kind of thing a bunch of toddlers jamming might come up with.  However, I eventually realized, as many others did, that Beefheart is a genius, and this is probably the most unique album in rock music.  So unique that I don't think anybody's ever tried a rip-off.  It wouldn't work, in any case.  Beefheart's inhuman growl plays against crazy jazz/blues avant-garde music for 80 minutes.  Approach with caution.
B00005MCX3|5.0|'Hall of The Mountain Grill' was, of course the landmark 1974 lp by Hawkwind that violinist Simon House had joined up. A few might say that House's addition mellowed the band out a bit, but I believe it took the long-running UK ensemble in a somewhat new direction. \\"D-Rider\\" is the outstanding Nik Turner track that he STILL plays in some of his live sets to this day. \\"Lost Johnny\\" was penned my Lemmy and the lp's two gems are \\"You'd Better Believe It\\" and \\"Psychedelic Warlords\\". The EMI edition of this reissue tags on four bonus tracks that are for the most part single edits of a couple of the tunes I've already mentioned in this review. Comes in both standard jewel case and digipack. A must have.

I'd rather see him than Ben Affleck ANY DAY!

0553573403|5.0|I have read many positive reviews of George R. R. Martin's series, Song of Ice and Fire, so I decided that I would give them a try, despite the three (current) books tremendous girth. Now, I have finished the first and smallest of the books, A Game of Thrones, and I am pleased that I was not dissuaded from reading these books. Although, I am not necessarily a fan of how Martin has structured his books, with numerous characters having their own chapters, I cannot get away from the story, the characters and the unique world, customs and conflicts that Martin has structured. I am amazed that Martin could have me switching my emotional allegiances with characters, particularly Tyrion (and I still am not sure where to stand with him), throughout the full book. The beauty of his writing is that I feel a connection and a need to know what happens, with each and every character. Half way through this book, I bought the second book in the series, A Clash of Kings just so that I could pick it up when I was done the first. With so many engaging characters and storyline, I must read the next book and the next one after that, and the fourth one, as I understand it that is coming out soon. The praise that I was given for this author and these books was well deserved and if you are looking for an engaging author, with an engaging story and a suite of characters that you \\"pull for,\\" that you want to succeed and that you feel for when they don't, read these books!

If I were to read into every story I tell my children, their library would be very limited!  Honestly, don't we live in a crazy enough world that people just can't accept this book for what it's simple message is?  Enjoy the time you have with your children - they'll grow up quicker than you think.
B00028HBKM|3.0|How in the world can something be reviewed if it's not out yet? <br /> <br />For all that these reviewers know, the dvd edition programs your player to explode or generate lethal gasses. That people are allowed to write reviews for something they can't POSSIBLY have seen for themselves is, at best, irresponsible. <br /> <br />Sure, we can take it with a grain of salt. Watching some thirteen year old talk extensively (almost a full paragraph) about how they got an advance copy of... whatever, and that it \\"r0x s0 HarD!\\" is something we can just splash through and wipe off with only a mild look of disgust. <br /> <br />But what about the supposed adults who feel compelled to simply upload a listing (often pulled from another site) of episodes and call it a \\"review\\"? What about those who reach for that brass ring of a $50 prize for a new book and so write a review about all the OTHER books the author has written? <br /> <br />So why are we allowed to give a thing ANY stars when it hasn't even hit the market? What are we allowed to write a review that implies we've seen the product? <br /> <br />It's lying. For profit, in fact. The dubious prestige of being The First Review or maybe winning some product, or whatever lame and pathetic excuse a person can come up with to justify their bid for attention. <br /> <br />But it shouldn't even be possible, and wouldn't, without Amazon's cooperation and tacit approval. It wouldn't take much effort to correct the problem, just a little bit of programming... but I'll bet my copy of Soothsayer (by Mike Resnick) that it doesn't happen. <br /> <br />Now I'm not expecting anything to come of this. Truth be told, I very much doubt that Amazon will post this. Then again, their editing of reviews seems to be slap-dash and cursory under the best of circumstances. <br /> <br />Let's find out, shall we?

B00018D3JQ|2.0|...and somehow, it just isn't the same. I was expecting a smooth, acid-jazzy, french-lounge-y, smart, trip-hop spin on my fave 80s alterna/synthpop tunes. But no.<br /><br />Think Jewel's voice, guitar and all, singing these new wave hits with happy relaxed flair, set to downtempo, bossa-nova'ed Dido-esque production---It just doesn't work.<br /><br />This album really proves why covers, as a whole, are really tough to finesse. Remakes of old 80's songs sped up to a higher bpm, set to catchy electronic beats always tend to fare better-- think of all the hit remakes of old songs. But on the flip side, covers of old songs slowed down to a lower bpm tend to lose their initial attraction and most importantly, the melody just gets LOST. Prime example: \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" which the female vocalist (who has that annoying, breathy, baby-girl voice), sings Martin Gore's classic without the synths.<br /><br />This album's production is actually quite slick (which merits the 2 star rating) with some good intros and a hint of electro styling. But hearing these 80s tunes without the catchy breaks and beeps, devoid of the minor-key melancholia, slugged 'n drugged down to chillout tempo with indie-folk styling---just doesn't sound right. It's uncomfortable. You'll find yourself itching, yearning even-- for the originals. I know I did.<br /><br />If you want chillout, get a good chillout album. There are plenty out there. But don't mix chillout and classic new wave songs and expect them to be just as good as the originals, if not better.  Nouvelle Vague gives me the chills---uncomfortable, itchy ones.
B000001FOS|5.0|Odyssey(1988). Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force's Fourth Album. The First And Last Album To Feature Vocalist Joe Lynn Turner.<br /><br />With Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads captivating millions with their Neo-Classical Guitar style and insane \\"shredding\\" abilities, these guys built the ground-work for master guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force's self-titled debut, 'Marching Out', and 'Trilogy' received huge amounts of critical and commercial fame, with Malmsteen garnering the attention he so deserved, and many claimed he was best guitarist on earth. For Malmsteen's fourth album, 'Odyssey', he decided to take the band in a more commercial and melodic approach, while all the time keeping the breathtaking guitar flourishes and Power Metal that defined his first albums. For starters, he hired a new vocalist, former-Rainbow vocalist(Wouldn't it have been insane to have gotten Dio?) Joe Lynn Turner, whose melodic and accessible vocals could reach a wider audience. Many fans of Malmsteen disapproved of the more commercial approach, yet many fans shrugged it off and took it as it was. So, does 'Odyssey' benifit from the obvious commercialism or does it hurt the album? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Rising Force- Behind a thunderous drum beat and eerie chanting, Malmsteen's electric guitar breaks out, delivering a hard-hitting, Van Halen-esque performance, except with actual talent. Turner's melodic, catchy vocals make this Power Metal song a guitar-driven masterpiece.<br /><br />Hold On- Much like Dokken or The Scorpions, Malmsteen blends a Power Metal ballad with unforgettable vocals from Turner and two unbelieveable guitar and keyboard solos. Odd, yet the perfect song to go out on a date with!<br /><br />Heaven Tonight- A fairly popular MTV video, \\"Heaven Tonight\\" was Malmsteen's blatant attempt at commercial success, and the result is very much like the Hair Metal ballads of the time, yet Turner's symphonic vocals, the uplifting choir, and Malmsteen's stellar guitarwork make \\"Heaven Tonight\\" a superb rocker.<br /><br />Dreaming(Tell Me)- An odd ballad, \\"Dreaming(Tell Me)\\" combines Turner's brooding vocals with an eerie keyboard/synthesizer beat. Malmsteen's acoustic guitar kicks in, and he adds in an electric guitar solo(or two?) that just amazes. How ballads should be done.<br /><br />Ride The Bullet- Imagine the immense talents Beethoven had with music and the piano, but think instead of Yngwie Malmsteen on guitar, and you get this instrumental.<br /><br />Riot In The Dungeons- \\"RIOT!\\" Take the melodicism and catchiness of Dokken, the heaviness of Motorhead, and the sheer brilliance of Malmsteen's immense guitar talents, stick 'em in a blender, and get this headbanging thrill-ride. Smokin'!<br /><br />Deja Vu- \\"Deja Vu, Dreams Come True, I See Myself Inside of You\\". How can you not like that line, especially when Turner's singing it?! Anyways, \\"Deja Vu\\" is once again a hard-hitting Power Metal rocker, blending a casual mixture of keyboards and guitars to create a surreal instrument experience. Malmsteen's *Red Hot Chili Peppers?*-esque solo is absolutely brilliant!<br /><br />Crystal Ball- Wow. The pure emotion in \\"Crystal Ball\\" simply astounds me, from the upbeat, hopeful opening guitar riff to the beautiful, radiant vocals from Turner. Although it might seem a little *corny* to some, \\"Crystal Ball\\" is an uplifting, inspiring melodic rocker with *super-cool* guitar work!<br /><br />Now Is The Time- An odd glimpse of Malmsteen's punkier side, \\"Now Is The Time\\" follows the melodic guitar-driven Power Metal of most tracks, but some of Malmsteen's riffs are undoubtedly punky(and great!), but the song still contains the catchy chorus and breathtaking solo you should expect by now.<br /><br />Faster Than The Speed of Light- When Yngwie titled this track, do you think he was talking about himself? Well, of course he was right! Turner's last vocal track of the album finds him singing his heart out, and much like Dio, his voice has compassion but also an unmistakeable edge. Combine Dio with the Scorpions, and poof, you get this Heavy Power Metal assault that's \\"faster than the speed of light\\"!<br /><br />Krakatau- A 6 minute, all Yngwie Malmsteen guitar instrumental. Need I say more?<br /><br />Memories- Ditto, except shorter.<br /><br />Overall, 'Odyssey' definitely lived up to the expectations I had set for Yngwie Malmsteen, and the praise that he's the best guitarist on Earth certainly holds true: I think I would have to agree. Although I'd heard anything past his first three albums was mediocre in comparison, if THAT's true, then his first albums must be flat-out masterpieces, because 'Odyssey' is simply magnificent. If you like Dio, The Scorpions, Dokken, Van Halen, Electric Guitar, and Heavy Metal, this album is an absolute MUST for you. I sware, Malmsteen will blow you away, or you SHOULD get your money back!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! YNGWIE WITH A GUITAR IS WHAT BEETHOVEN WAS TO A PIANO: AN INSTRUMENTAL GENUIS!

B0000563FW|5.0|I still enjoy this album very much today. There is their very beautiful hit \\"I'm not scared\\" produced by the Pet Shop Boys. That song along makes it all worth. Then there are their other hits like \\"Will you remember\\" and \\"Baby baby\\" with Patsy's nice and warm voice. She doesn't have the strongest voice, but she has charm. All songs are chosen well and support Patsy. it's a shame she gave up her singing career after this album. I wish there would be more releases by Patsy Kensit & Eighth Wonder
B0000019PA|5.0|If I could give it a higher rating, I would.  Its been about six years since this album came out, and I remember putting off reviewing it at the time, because I knew it was a special album that I wouldn't fully appreciate until later.  Six years later, and I still play it multiple times a week.  Jeff Mangum truly explored the redemptive spirit of music on this album, and its a shame that we haven't had another Neutral Milk album since.  Its hard to imagine how he stopped believing after delivering a record that touched so many people (just look at all of the reviews.)  I still sing along to King of Carrot Flowers I, and I still cry to King of Carrot Flowers II.  A truly perfect album that will be with us for a long time.

B0000D96NW|5.0|Im 24 years old,so Burn my Eyes for me is their best album,maybe because it was kind of a influence to me...but TAOE its quite something,Machine Head at its best,long time after what is already proclamed one of the best albuns in the metal history.<br /><br />so get ready, because this one is going to make history too ,because its... todays Machine Head at their best! I saw them once,for about 6 months and they did a great show in Oporto (Portugal), the largest moshpit MH had the pleasure to have!(they wrote it on their page.)
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is actually a good CD.this album covers evrything from op to some hip/hop to R&B to techno.She does a good job and this is a great album.The best one i have heard to date.It starts off with \\"Me Against The Music\\" a great attempt with Madonna following the two lockin lips on MTV. \\"Breathe On Me\\" a sort of techno feel but it feels really sexy and is  a goo good song..Other songs like \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" show case Brit and her self pleasuring moments and another brilliant decision.Other notworthy tracks are...\\"Outrageous\\", \\"Everytime\\" , \\"Brave New Girl\\" , \\"Toxic\\", \\"Early Mornin\\" and \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)..There are quite a few songs on here that will eb played in clubs that you could shake something to.. <br /> <br />FINAL CALL:BUY THE ALBUM its actually good..even though her vocal chops aren't nay where near all that... <br /> <br />OVERALL GRADE  87/100 = B
B00005NP04|5.0|Ms. McBride shows her vast ability on serious ballads such as the dark \\"Independence Day\\" and the fun \\"My Baby Loves Me.\\" This album is indeed a...well, a Greatest Hits album! A must for Martina fans!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Critics and fans agree, this is the best show ever.  Finally, we can watch them without commercials and without the merciless editing of syndication. <br /> <br />Now, for those of you whom do not consider this the greatest show ever, I feel sorry for you because it just means you have missed the point.  OF COURSE THE CHARACTERS ARE SELF CENTERED!  First, the show is about THEM!  Second, its satire, people!  In case you haven't noticed, America is self-centered, and Americans are self-centered.  Sure, there are those of us who aren't, but come on.  If you don't act like the characters in Seinfeld, you at least want to from time to time.  Plus, it's FUNNY!  Oh, Friends makes me laugh, but not like Seinfeld.  The way David and Seinfeld string together the multiple plots is pure genius.  (See Curb Your Enthusiasm for a continuance of this genius.)  Best of all, Seinfeld is the perfect mix of low-brow and intelligent humor.  And there is never any true drama (unlike Friends).  It's just a smart, witty, funny show.  And it's all about nothing.  Marvelous!
B000092Q4U|4.0|cannot come up with why I didnt give it a five, other than its not perfect, but its a great album.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Is it fun?  A lot of the time .... you betcha. <br /> <br />Is it original? A lot of the time.... not really. <br /> <br />Is it socially insightful or relevant?  Arguable on a variety of levels <br /> <br />Do any of these things matter?  Who cares?   <br /> <br />Does it rock?  I think so!!  (It may not pass the Jack Black 'School of Rock' classic acid test but again so what?) <br /> <br />You either like or you dont.  (Funny how people try to argue their tastes, but in the end you really cant argue taste. Try telling me after 46 years that canned peas taste good....yuck.)I've read through a number of the reviews on this album, was struck by the wide range of scores, so I thought I would weigh in.  Remember its just my taste and not yours.  So those of you who might be compelled to rip me like on others have done here to others, just know that I could give a rat's you know what... <br /> <br />I heard all the obvious influences.  I liked them.  I even liked the not so obvious influences.  No its not Blink 182, Creed, the Beastie Boys or other alternative sounds...not by a long shot. Then again its not the Dandy Warhols, Foo Fighters, Dark Star or Wilco for that matter.     <br /> <br />Lyrically, I would say that 99% of all rock is challenged.  But frankly, that's not rock's strong suit.  And I would have to agree that this is the case with this release.  (Go listen to Cake or the Offspring if you want to be tickled. Or Bob Dylan or Neil Young if you want to learn something.  Or just put on whatever ear candy that moves you if you could care less sometimes like me.  It's all good!!!) <br /> <br />And all this nonsense about repetitiveness is bogus. Every band I know of has its own sound which upon repeated listening becomes repetitive.  That's also what makes them good.  No one that I know of could ever convince me that the Stones, the Beatles, The Who, Zeppelin and Pink Floyd didn't (or dont) sound pretty much the same from one release to the next.  There are afterall only so many ways that you can take 4 to 5 people, playing 4 to 5 instruments, and make them sound different.  That's a problem with arrangement.  Not to mention vocal signatures. <br /> <br />So what's the bottom line for me.  Well in the end, as I said -- it's just Jet.  That is good enough for me!!!
B0002DB52M|2.0|too slow, it literally takes place on a generic stage to look like a play. Bushes and dogs are drawn in with chalk. It's a pillow movie. Its better to read the synopsis and skip ahead. I was going to give it one star, but Im a sucker for revenge movies, so I gave it an extra star. Its just to bad you have to get through 2-3hrs of movie just for the ending you've been waiting for.   ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz
B00002ND77|5.0|I love everything about this film.  It is well written, well directed and the performance by Denzel Washington is the best, in my opinion, of his career.  I first saw this movie in high school while it was playing at the theater.  Our class deemed it so important and fundamental that we chose to go to the theater and see this movie and make a class trip out of it.  Admittedly, I had never really known anything about Malcolm X until this movie was made, and it propelled me to read and purchase his autobiography, which is the perfect supplement to this movie.      Surely, this movie should have been nominated for an academy award for best picture and Denzel Washington should have won for best actor for this movie--not Training Day, which is not a good movie.

B00005K9LK|5.0|When I first heard \\"The Hellion/Electric Eye\\", I couldn't help but notice that it sounded almost made for being played live.  After seeing Judas Priest last week, my suspicion was confirmed.  That was definitely one of the best live songs ever!  A great way to open up an album of this magnitude as well.  This is one of the most important additions to anyone's metal anthology.  Halford and company are in top form on this release.  Fans just getting into metal need to pick this up so they can see where their favorite artists of today received their influences.
B00005AAFS|5.0|If you can get past the language barrier (which was hard for me as well, I hated it at first) Then you would enjoy a power house of a metal band!
B000003CMC|4.0|The CD 'Eat a Peach' is \\"dedicated to a brother\\".  That brother, of course, was lead guitarist Duane Allman who died shortly after recording several of the studio tracks included on this disc.  He was run down by a peach truck while riding a motorcycle.  That fact alone adds great significance to the album, because Duane Allman's brief stint as \\"a brother\\" helped establish much of the band's appeal.  The studio tracks featuring Duane, 'Stand Back', 'Blue Sky', and Duane's own composition, 'Little Martha', are some of the finest the band ever laid down.  In addition, the disc contains three live tracks that feature Duane, and again, the quality is remarkable.  'One Way Out' and 'Trouble No More' are blues-rock classics, and the band's thirty-three plus minute take on Donovan Leitch's 'First There Is a Mountain' (which abandons any semblance to that song about four minutes into the track), retitled 'Mountain Jam', adds further evidence of Duane's slide guitar virtuosity.  The band was far from folding after losing Duane, but they lost one of their signature dimensions. <br /> <br />While admittedly one doesn't often take in 'Mountain Jam' (it might be an interesting diversion on a cross-country road trip), the essential offerings don't end there.  Fortunately the Allman Brothers Band featured not only two full drum kits, but also two premier lead guitarists.  Despite losing Duane's talents, the presence of Dicky Betts on second lead guitar allowed the band to continue to produce the best southern blues-rock ever put on vinyl.  The album opens with three timeless, post-Duane  tunes, 'Ain't Wastin' Time No More', the instrumental 'Les Bres In A Minor', and 'Melissa', something of a dirge to lost brother Duane from keyboardist, lead singer, and blood brother Gregg Allman.  The answer to 'Melissa's lyrical question, \\"Will you hide the dead man's ghost?\\" is answered in the title and content of the album.  Duane's presence and influence would not be shuffled aside, but celebrated.  Betts also penned and sang lead vocal on 'Blue Sky', which has become an Allman Brother's classic. <br /> <br />'Eat a Peach', to me, has always been THE Allman Brother's Band album to own.  During my college days in the early 1970's I owned this and the 'Brothers and Sisters' LP on vinyl, and a friend of mine was seriously addicted to their 'Live At the Fillmore East' album, featuring the classic live recording of 'Whipping Post'.  While all three are excellent recordings well worth owning, there is something special about the transitional nature of this album, and the heartache it is steeped in.  The album diligently rocks, and when respites arrive such as 'Melissa' and 'Blue Sky', it loses no emotion, drive, or direction... it just plugs away at fewer decibels.  Duane and the band were at their peak on 'Eat a Peach', and to hear them carry on so effortlessly after their loss is mesmerizing. <br /> <br />There is an overabundance of elite musicianship and composing genius on 'Eat a Peach'.  If you have even an inkling of appreciation for southern blues-rock, be sure to bite into this.  Eat a peach, indeed. <br /> <br />
B00003CWL6|5.0|As the title of this review implies, this is my favorite movie.  <br />...ever. To write a synopsis of the plot is an effort in futility, because this movie just cannot be understood without seeing it. Part of what makes it so good is the character development. Every character feels like a real person. You can understand characters that only appear briefly in a few scenes. Ricky Fitts' mother for example. She doesn't even have any crucual lines, but you get the feeling that you know what she's all about. The acting in this movie also contributes to that. Not only are all the characters developed, but the actors know their characters too. Kevin Spacey leads, but even the kids do a phenominal job. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. <br />                       ...now. <br />                              Why are you still reading this?
B0000067L2|4.0|In the summer of 1968 a friend and I were fortunate fourteen-year olds... we scored a brief summer job clearing knee-high weeds from behind a sign manufacturing shop.  With our $30 windfall we purchased two of the classic psychedelic albums released the previous year.  I walked home with The Beatles 'Sgt. Peppers', while my buddy picked up Cream's 'Disraeli Gears'.  Both were wise purchases, but I felt I had made the better choice since I got the cool pop-out Pepper inserts!  Given the same choice today, I may well walk home with Cream... <br /> <br />'Disraeli Gears' is, arguably, the finest album recorded by Cream.  The only real competition is from 'Wheels Of Fire', and that's a double-lp, so it's difficult to make comparisons.  It is one of several albums that made the late-1960's psychedelic era the psychedelic era.  It was the second of their four studio releases, and for most people it was the work that brought the band to their attention.  Cream had a hit with 'Crossroads' from their first album, but 'Sunshine of Your Love' rose to number five on the national charts, and essentially ushered in the heavy metal feel for bands like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple.  The overall strength of 'Disraeli Gears' also easily eclipsed the quality of their first album, 'Fresh Cream'.  Eric Clapton indulges heartily in the mainstay of psychedelic rock, the wah-pedal guitar, while Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce add their readily distinguishable style on drums and bass, respectively.  All three contribute to the vocals, though Clapton and Bruce share most of the leads. <br /> <br />The origins of psychedelic rock albums and songs often has strange origins, and this album is a case in point.  Consider that the title for this album was gleaned from a mispronunciation of \\"derailleur gears\\" for racing bicycles as \\"Disraeli gears\\".  Can you imagine how many hours stoned-out freaks spent contemplating the connection between Benjamin Disraeli and gears?  Ukulele Music To My Ears would have rhymed and perhaps made more sense.  The psychedelic imagery is ever-present in the lyrics as well.  'SWLABR', for example, is an acronym for She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow, words that appear nowhere in this rocked-up tune (though we are told that \\"the picture has a mustache\\"...).   <br /> <br />I love the beginning of 'Disraeli Gears'.  'Strange Brew', which gleaned a lot of playing time on the emerging FM stations of the era, is the opener.  It's followed by 'Sunshine of Your Love', 'World of Pain' and 'Dance the Night Away', superb psychedelic rock numbers.  You would be hard pressed to find four finer consecutive songs on any disc.  'Blue Condition', like 'We're Going Wrong' are both slow, dismal numbers, which capture their stories well, but seem to stand in the way of rummaging through the other great rock tracks on the disc, 'Tales of Brave Ulysses', an excellent electrified cover of Arthur Reynold's 'Outside Woman Blues', and 'Take It Back'.  'Mother's Lament', a short (1:47), traditional cockney number, is the a capella closer, essentially a throw-away unless you're into traditional cockney numbers.   <br /> <br />Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce are the author's of most of the great compositions found on 'Disraeli Gears'.  The album is steeped in memorable guitar riffs and clever, thought-provoking lyrics.  And few bands, especially bands stripped down to lead guitar, bass and drums, aside from today's White Stripes (who somehow do it with two...), rocked as fluidly as Cream.  There won't be a dollar of your entertainment money wasted here.
6305313687|5.0|American History X blew me away the first time I watched it. The story is both political and personal, and forces you to think about the world around you in a different way.  <br />But, if you have any problems with violence or language this is not the movie for you. I wouldn't call it excessive, because that would be saying that there's more than there should be, and that's not the case. In order for this story to be told well the graphic content is necessary. <br />Don't let the violence or language push you away from this unless that is something that completely ruins a movie for you. This really is an awesome movie.
B00005214X|4.0|It's interesting to note how the work of John, Paul, George and Ringo is faring over time.  While I was once a dyed-in-the-wool fan of both their collective and solo works, I've found my appreciation for their music has waned over time, especially in the last few years.  Nevertheless, their impact has been profound, and the success of the 'Anthology' releases suggests their music retains a timeless appeal, able to catapult a band defunct for nearly 3 full decades to the most prominent spot on the national charts (though this also serves as an indictment of how music has evolved in the intervening years...).  For whatever reason, the music of the Liverpool Moptops that still turns my ear is their most early work, and the solo works just subsequent to their break-up, such as McCartney's 'Wildlife' and 'Ram' albums.  Perhaps it is the 'something-to-prove' drive in both instances that puts these works 'over-the-top' for me. <br /> <br />'All Things Must Pass' is, in many people's opinion, the finest solo work produced by any of the ex-Beatles, and I really have no argument with that.  In order to feel that way, however, I believe you have to be able to get over the many ways in which this two-disc set (embellished with bonus tracks, it originally composed 3 vinyl albums) is 'over-the-top'.  In the liner notes, George himself notes that he wishes the songs could be \\"liberated\\" from the Phil Spector produced wall-of-sound that permeates selected tracks.  It's easy to see what George means on the more bombastic numbers such as 'Awaiting On You All' (the title makes it sound like it should be sung with a southern drawl), 'Wah-Wah', and 'What Is Life', which not coincidentally are my three favorite tracks in the collection.  There is simply so much sound on these tracks that the vocals are all but muted.  Nevertheless, the songs were written for a time when this was 'the sound', and the wall-of-sound may be their best vehicle.  The bonus tracks include a stripped down 'Beware Of Darkness' and a new (2000) version of 'My Sweet Lord', neither of which seem to benefit from being retooled or presented in fewer decibels. <br /> <br />But George is 'over-the-top' in so many other ways as well.  Harrison's Hare Krishna faith, for example, is woven throughout the disc, but he sings of Jesus and \\"Sister Mary\\" as well.  It takes an almighty faith to embrace them all.  The themes can be heavy-handed also, as in 'Isn't It a Pity', a real guilt inducing track, versions of which are offered on both discs.  Also consider the line-up of musicians assembled by George for this Herculian effort:  Derek and the Domino's along with Badfinger, as well as such individual notables as Ringo Starr, Dave Mason, Klaus Voorman, and Phil Collins (at the time an unknown, playing conga's on 'The Art of Dying').  I'm not complaining about all this talent, but it is instructive about where the whole project, and George's head, were at. <br /> <br />All those things being said, there is a wealth of fine music on 'All Things Must Pass'.  Two of the best songs are co-written by George and Bob Dylan, 'I'd Have You Anytime' and 'If Not For You', which really should have been a hit single on the order of 'Something'.  Both songs carry unmistakable Dylan markings, but Harrison makes the songs his own.  Other beauties are 'Let It Down', 'Run of the Mill', 'Beware of Darkness', 'All Things Must Pass', 'I Dig Love' and a previously unreleased period-piece with a decided country twang, 'I Live For You', which makes this remastered edition a must-have over the original CD.  I could probably live without the only charting song from the collection, 'My Sweet Lord', which went to number one in late 1970, but caused Harrison grief due to his unconscious(?) lifting of the melody from The Chiffon's 'He's So Fine'.  I've just heard it too much.  'Apple Scruffs', 'Let It Roll' and 'Hear Me Lord', all from the second disc, are other songs I could probably survive without. <br /> <br />Certainly over-the-top was the inclusion of the 'Original Jam' disc in the original vinyl edition, and the superfluous inclusion of the same on CD.  It was the era of 'the jam'... the Allman Brothers did it on 'Eat a Peach' and Iron Butterfly did it on 'In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida'(baby), and George is certainly jamming with the best (including Billy Preston and Ginger Baker on one track), but it's just a little high-minded and one wonders what other out-takes (such as 'I Live For You') could better occupy the space. <br /> <br />Better over-the-top than significantly under it as many CD's are, however.  Wouldn't you agree?  And George has passed away, but his music continues through the passage of our times. <br /> <br />
B00005ALRO|5.0|Harrison Ford is better known for his roles as Han Solo or Indiana Jones, but he does an excellent job as Dr. Richard Kimble in this exciting movie based on the 1960s television series by the same name.  Richard returns home from a fund-raiser to find that his wife has been brutally murdered, and a man is still in his house.  Richard, who soon discovers that the assailant has a mechanical arm, struggle, but the man escapes.  Meanwhile, as she lay dying, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) makes a 911 phone call that appears to implicate Richard.    Richard is tried and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection.  Richard is to be transferred to a maximum security prison along with three other inmates.  Once on the prison bus, one inmate fakes a seizure and stabs a security guard.  Another guard begins randomly firing a shotgun and hits the bus driver by mistake.  The bus careens off the road, falls down a hill, and comes to rest on a set of railroad tracks.  Battered and shaken, Richard tries to free the wounded guard, but an ominous noise makes him stop; a train is approaching!!      The next scenes are some of the best movie footage I've seen as Richard barely escapes before the train slams into the bus.  The engine comes uncoupled from the train and hurtles out of control, while Richard can barely move in his leg shakles.  He manages to get out of the way as the train flys past.    U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, played superbly by Tommy Lee Jones, soon has his men hunting for Richard. aided by his sidekick Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Sam is determined to find Richard and bring him to justice.    Richard eludes the Marshalls for the time being, but Sam soon catches up to him on a dam of all places.  Cornered, Richard does the only thing he can think of; he jumps.  Dumbfounded, Sam can only watch as Richard plummets over the side of the dam.  Sam doesn't believe that Richard died during the fall, so he sets out on his chase again.    This is oneof the best action/thrillers that I've seen.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford give Oscar-caliber performances, and the supporting cast of Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, and Jereen Krabbe turn in fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the eye-popping train scene and Ford's plunge from the dam are excellent as well.    I highly recommend this film.  The acting is first rate, and the twists and turns will keep you guessing throughout.  Watch and see Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones at their absolute best.

0765301598|2.0|I just finished reading this \\"Dune\\" book and I have to say I am perplexed.  It was mindless entertainment, but I can't count it as good for that very reason.  Dune fans have grown up with a series that is steeped in complexities and three dimmensional characters and this is the very thing that keeps us coming back to the series.  The original Dune books, while entertaining, all had meaning.  This book doesn't.  It seems to squander all its potentiality to create real people by limiting their appearences to mere soundbites.  In fact the only characters who seem to have been well developed are the robots, simply because there isn't really that much to them.  Overall, if you're a Dune fan, you'l act exactly like me.  You'll rush out and buy the book, excitedly start to read it-grasping for the sparks of the original series- and ultimatly walk away dissatisfied. <br /> <br />AD
B0002OOUP0|3.0|I paid for the original import (thru the nose, as always) before their last \\"greatest hits\\" 40 Licks was released. I'm not sure why it took so long for this to be released in the States and why they would release it after 40 Licks. The industry likes to mine those catalog gems, especially when new albums are few and far between. Just look at the new Van Halen. I think Aerosmith has released about 4 \\"greatest hits\\" packages within the last 10 years. For \\"Jump Back\\", I like the track listing, but would have preferred the following additions: She's So Cold, Hang Fire, She Was Hot, One Hit (To The Body), Shattered, Can't You Hear Me Knocking. If you don't have \\"40 Licks\\" and need some post 1971 Stones, go for it.
0060090383|5.0|I stumbled upon Marian Keyes' books while searching for a vacation read in the paperback section, and my first Keyes' book was Last Chance Saloon, which I loved.  I was instantly hooked on her witty, charming style as well as her hilarious characters, which she develops so well you feel like you really know them.  I knew I had to read more of her books! <br /> <br />Rachel's Holiday was absolutely my favorite Keyes book.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of them (especially the books about the Walsh sisters--Watermelon, Angels) but Rachel's Holiday touched me emotionally more than the rest.  This book manages to combine a serious subject (drug addiction) with the humorous, hilarious style of Keyes without being either too sappy or too serious.   <br /> <br />I was amazed at the way this book took me through different emotions--at first I was completely on Rachel's side, believing that she had been wrongly \\"incarcerated\\" in a rehab program for a purely recreational party habit.  But as I read further, I loved the way Keyes unfolded more and more details about the seriousness of Rachel's problem and how it affected those around her. <br /> <br />The best part of this book was, as I said earlier, the way Keyes balanced the seriousness of the subject with her hilarious wit and characters so real you feel like you know them personally.  This book made me laugh out loud on several occasions, while also completely changing my view of things from the way I first perceived them in the book. (I HATED Brigit at first, but by the end I understood where she was coming from.)  It was those types of surprises with the characters and really getting to know them that made me really connect with this story. <br /> <br />I read this book in 3 days and I was sorry when it ended, I wanted to read more!  I have loved all of Keyes' books and look forward to more.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|This was actually available as an import for a long time, why it's released here, now, I don't know. But anyway, it's a decent hits disc of their later material, and similiar to the out of print \\"Rewind\\" collection, but longer. Alot of great tracks are on here, like \\"Start Me Up\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Angie\\", \\"Miss You\\", and \\"Bitch\\". I'm also glad it has \\"Waiting On A Friend\\". The downside it that it's missing even more than it includes, but for that you could always just get the 2-disc \\"40 Licks\\". Either way, \\"It's Only Rock N' Roll\\".
015603008X|5.0|This book was published in 1959.  A long time ago, right?  While reading this book a couple of parts made even my eyebrows rise slightly.  Maybe it wasn't that these parts are contreversial to today's standards, but coming from a book from the fifties, an era known for suburbs and things remaining \\"clean cut\\", this book is a shocker.   <br /> <br />  Charlie Gordon is inapproprietly called a moron by everyone from his parents to his co-workers.  He knows he isn't smart like normal people yet tries as hard as anyone to become smart.  When he is in his thirties his I.Q. is at a low of 60.  This is when he has the expiremental surgery that will raise his I.Q. to an amazing 185. But first he must wait and \\"be patient\\"(as his teacher Ms. Kinnian tells him)  And soon everyone begins to notice Charlie's change and he loses his job over it.  He begins to get confused and is wondering ewhen his emotional level will reach his I.Q.  He uses sex, liquor, and books to adjust to life.  And this begins his rapid downfall...
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have seen this mini-series and like every movie that will ever be made by any film maker (US, Ireland, China, Germany, etc&#133;) it is not an accurate account of what really happen.  If the US did not save Europe who did?  Was it the Russians, the French, the German&#146;s?  I forgot the German&#146;s where conquering Europe.   Ireland, who did HELP save Europe?  Any way, I am thankful and grateful for all who fought to free Europe and the rest of the countries in this world.  I am a naturalized citizen and retired member of the Arm Forces of the USA, who with out their  sacrifices I would have not been able to come to this great, wounderful, and giving nation I call my home.  It also shows the stupidity of the leadership of all nations, but most of all it shows the prize that Americans paid for the freedom we have today.  God bless all those who fight for freedom.  This is what this movie is all about, FREEDOM!
0684833395|5.0|There's one thing about this book first published in 1955 which, at the time of this writing, was darn close to a half-century ago: it is revered as one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. In fact, there's some pretty compelling arguments why it could be considered the best novel of the 20th century. This from the critics.  <br /> <br />It's also an enormous international bestseller. That is to say, it's not some kind of weird, experimental thing with some enormous political axe to grind that normally wins Pulitzers and garners accolades from the effete in their ivory towers. This is a book that all kinds of people from all walks of life have read and enjoyed. <br /> <br />Business Leader take note: when a book touches both the masses and the critics then something has been written that touches a chord in all humanity. This is something that you can learn from and use in your business setting. These books reveal the secrets about how everybody feels. It helps you violate the law against fooling all of the people all of the time, so to speak.  <br /> <br />We believe that Catch-22 has something even more special to offer. It reveals the truth about bureaucracy.  <br /> <br />It's a lot of fun today--and really has been since the time of the trustbusters in the age of Theodore Roosevelt--to hate big giant corporations. You can't sit in a coffee shop without hearing someone rant about Big Business and the evils it perpetrated upon the environment and people of struggling nations. You can't turn to fiction without constantly seeing Big Business presented as an all-consuming evil that manipulates nations and lives to its whims. The press has long delighted in portraying Big Business as preying upon the decent, the common, and the innocent.  <br /> <br />And in some cases they may be right.  <br /> <br />But there is a different truth. It is the truth that Big Business can't possibly organize itself and come to the kind of consensus necessary to prosecutethe vast majority of the injustices for which they're blamed. The simple truth of the matter is that bureaucracy--that maelstrom of decayed policies, outdated procedures, the futile and whimsical direction of middle-managers who have given up home, the ambitious subterfuge of self-serving middle-managers who are--or perceive that they are--on their way up, all crashing together like the planetessimiles in a proto-solar system bound together by the gravity of a thousand conflicting agenda, beliefs, and ideals... that bureaucracy prevents.  <br /> <br />Big Business blunders. It blunders its way through the world achieving much more by accident than it ever does by intent. It is why Big Businesses, which has always founded its strength upon originality, daring, and speed retreat to defense in lawyers and regulations when they age and suddenly find themselves stagnant, timid, and slow. The inevitable gravitational pull of bureaucracy on any Big Business pulls all to an entropic heat death.  <br /> <br />Catch-22 is a case study in exactly that kind of bureaucracy. It is the bureaucracy of the military--but really the same infectious bureaucracy found everywhere--as it attempts to win a war. An endless display of very real people are introduced to this blender of military bureaucracy and it is reduced to the terrible comedic.  <br /> <br />People love to read this book because it is so funny. But it's funny because the bureaucracy is so familiar. The people's behavior remind us of how the world really works outside of the board rooms, court rooms, and throne rooms.  <br /> <br />Every business leader should read this book if only to become so intimately familiar with the face of bureaucracy, which will always be the final and most terrible enemy that any business can face.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM
B00004Z459|1.0|Why is this considered good music now? Here's the thing: these guys can't play their instruments. Now, even that doesn't mean they're completely useless. Hell, the only member of Nirvana that really knew his instrument was Dave Grohl. But they made up for it with genius songcrafting and beautiful lyrics. Linkin Park can't even do that. Their lyrics are shallow, one-dimensional drivel that shouldn't even be printed in the junior high literary magazine. Yes -- it's that bad. <br /> <br />Admittedly, metal is not my favorite genre -- I prefer the alternative stuff that sprung up in the '90s. But I can admit when there are talented metal bands -- Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, etc. Bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot, and the kings Limp Bizkit are NOT in those ranks.  <br /> <br />Only buy this CD if you're a twelve-year-old who, for lack of actual problems, needs to contrive some crap about how your parents just don't understand and Chester has all the answers, and you're not intelligent enough to tell the difference between good and bad lyrics. Otherwise, skip it. I promise you, you're not missing much. In terms of longevity, these guys are comparable to the Backstreet Boys -- they'll be gone in 5 years.

B00003CXCT|5.0|That's it . . . I've had it. No really. I didn't want to bother putting in my two cents, but I am really getting sick of all this Lucas bashing and SW bashing. <br /> <br />First of all, let's have a slight reality check here, shall we? Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, or whatever the heck you want to call it, is NOT a masterpiece! OK? You were all probably 12 when you first saw it, and now all those warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia are clouding your judgment.  <br /> <br />Case in point . . . I was watching ANH the other day on VHS, and BOY does it look horrible. I mean HORRIBLE. Let's start with the little bit I actually was able to sit through:  <br /> <br />1) The Stormtroopers are idiots. Let's face it. These guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. All they can do is shuffle around like idiots in oversized helmets while firing cheap looking laser shots that go nowhere. In fact, how in the WORLD does Han Solo, a guy with one blaster, scare away and chase down an entire regiment of troopers? Where did Vader find these guys? And if they are such idiots, how in the world did they takeover the galaxy in the first place? <br /> <br />2) Vader's fight with Obi-Wan-Kenobi is attrocious. I mean, I know one guy is old and the other guy is on some kind of breather, but COME ON, I could fight better than that. In addition, at one point during the fight, Obi-Wan-Kenobi's lightsaber turns into a point of light that looks like a Christmas tree bulb (I guess Lucas didn't know how to make a lightsaber from the top looking down). Just imagine if the trilogies were reversed, and ANH came out in 2008, how outraged fanboys would be by such a geriatric, anti-climactic battle.   <br /> <br />3) Serious visual flaw: Since when does junk float? In the garbage compacter scene, big chunks of metal debris just float to the top of the water. Um . . . I know the props are fake, but these spaceship parts look too obviously like bits of cardboard and styrofoam. <br /> <br />4) ReallyBAD SFX: Sure, for '77 the FX were really something, but the black box surrounding the incoming TIE-fighters are just too noticeable. Another scene involving has an X-Wing zoom over the top of the Death Star (which looks so obviously like a very cheap plastic model set) and the laser blasts that shoot off of it spark like fireworks! Thank God Lucas added those extra seconds where you can actually see the Death Star in all its magnificently massive, spherical glory. <br /> <br />5) Sure you say, all this is bad, but Star Wars isn't about SFX and action scenes, its about plot and acting! Gimme a break! If you care about that, you should be on the Godfather message board.  <br /> <br />So let's talk about plot and acting in ANH. When Luke finds out his aunt and uncle are dead, he basically forgets about them (these people who basically raised him like parents from birth!) in about a few minutes. But when Obi-Wan-Kenobi dies, a man he just met and knows for about a couple of hours, he freaks out and gets very emotional. How's that for coherence?  <br /> <br />I could go on and on like this . . . but I won't. The fact of the matter is ANH is really not as great as you remember it, or you would like to believe it was. I was 2 when the movie came out, and now I am 29, and obviously my life-experiences are going to taint my view of it today. Does that mean it is a bad movie? By no means. The things we love about Star Wars are still there . . . which is, I believe, the incredible world George Lucas realized, a world that, as children and sometimes adults, we can dream about long after the credits roll. A few minutes of altered footage isn't going to ruin the DVD's for me, even if I don't agree that Jabba the Hutt should remain anonymous in ANH.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|After 1999's \\"The Time Machine,\\" Alan Parsons and his longtime musical collaborators since the late 70's, guitarist Ian Bairnson and drummer Stuart Eliott, decided the time had come to go their separate ways. No animosity---they just decided that they'd taken Parsons' trademark style of progressive pop/rock as far as it could go, and they all wanted to work with other people. For Parsons, this meant that his next album was going to be something totally different from anything he'd done in the past. Five years later, we have that album at last: \\"A Valid Path.\\" This album is bound to generate different reactions from different Parsons fans, because \\"A Valid Path\\" is Alan Parsons' very first sojourn into the world of *electronica* music. Some fans will love it right away, some will warm up to it after a few listens, and yes, some fans are bound to be put off by it. Me? I'm in the first group all the way. I think \\"A Valid Path\\" is a truly inventive, colorful, hypnotic, intelligent platter of music, and one of Parsons' very best. Not only am I excited by Parsons doing something totally different here, I am also thrilled that he REALLY got involved with this album. \\"The Time Machine\\" is a great album, but I was disappointed that Parsons didn't do much more than simply produce it. With \\"A Valid Path,\\" Parsons co-wrote all of the material, plays instruments on most of the tracks, and, for the proverbial cherry on top, he sings his very first *natural-sounding* lead vocal on a song! (He sang the first section of \\"The Raven\\" on 1976's \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination,\\" but his voice was distorted by a vocoder). Collaborating with Parsons on \\"A Valid Path\\" are some of the biggest names in electronica music---The Crystal Method, Shpongle, P.J. Olsson, Nortec Collective, Deep E, and Uberzone. Even Parsons' son, Jeremy Parsons, helps out his dad with the programming on several tracks. And, for the coup de grace, Parsons even managed to reel in legendary guitarist David Gilmour of Pink Floyd to play on the opening cut. The album's first track, \\"Return To Tunguska,\\" is a hypnotic wonder, with David Gilmour playing some amazing guitar solos on top of it (and a message to Floyd fans: if you've been starving for a new Pink Floyd fix for the last ten years, then \\"Return To Tunguska\\" is probably as close as you're gonna get to one). \\"More Lost Without You\\" is easily the most radio-friendly song on the album, but it's a catchy, bouncy tune, with a fine lead vocal by P.J. Olsson. Then, Parsons treats us to an electronica remake of the classic \\"Eye In The Sky\\" instrumental, \\"Mammagamma.\\" Some may argue that this track is simply filler, but I think it works really well, and it IS a lot of fun to hear \\"Mammagama\\" with a fresh coat of paint. Then comes the song where Parsons REALLY stands up and has himself counted, \\"We Play The Game\\"---Alan wrote the lyrics, co-wrote the music, plays keyboards, guitars & bass, AND sings the lead vocal. It's a breathtaking number, and it also proves that Parsons is, in fact, a darn good singer! I hope his success in creating this song will convince Parsons to sing lead on more songs in the future. \\"Tijuaniac\\" is the most laid-back piece on the album, but it's very lush and sensual, with some excellent percussion throughout. Heck, it can even work as background music for lovemaking. \\"L'Arc En Ciel\\" kicks off with some marvelous rainstorm sound effects before transforming into a driving, atmospheric piece. It's a great feast for the ears. Parsons goes back in time once more with \\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream,\\" a reworking of two classic tracks from \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination.\\" Again, some might say it's filler, but I love the freshness that Parsons brings to this classic Project oldie. \\"You Can Run\\" is a strong, rough & tough electronic rocker, featuring lead vocals by David Pack of Ambrosia. Finally, the album heads for home with \\"Chomolungma,\\" a powerful instrumental with a great orchestral ambience to it, featuring some haunting tribal chants toward the end.
B00004CWO8|3.0|This is a very new twist on a very traditional ballet.  It is very well done in most regards except for one thing: the choreography by Matthew Bourne is disappointingly insipid and not up to modern standards.  It is a pity to have some of the best dancers in the world and a good concept and waste it on inferior choreography. <br />    The music is, of course, some of the best thematic music written, but it was prerecorded for the performance and suffers from lack of presence. <br />     If you must have something different in a 'Swan Lake\\" and you want a meager sample of Adam Cooper, this will do.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I really liked this movie and felt the actors have really matured in this darker installment.  I understand they couldn't possibly put every last detail of the book into the movie, like when Harry browsed and hung around the wizard shops for a week before school started, but there were some important key moments missing that I think hurt a little. As I have a huge crush on Alan Rickman, I wish the movie had more of Snape's parts from the book.  One of my favorite parts in the book is when Snape tries to make the mauraders map work and he gets a bunch of insults instead and Harry starts yelling at Snape in the same scene.  They took a lot out of that scene for the movie and I was a bit dissapointed as with some other things missing that I wished had been in the movie.  However, I can't complain too much, because I did have an excellent time in the theater and I'll be just like any other crazy fan waiting impatiently for my copy.  I do worry however about J.K. Rowlings books getting longer and longer (which I love),but does that mean the movies in the future will be more and more choppy so that they can make them about an hour and a half long?  I think the readers have matured along with the characters and I think we're all ready for longer movies.  Not that they have to be four hours long or anything (because my butt will fall asleep), but maybe a little longer to get some key points across.  Cuaron did an excellent job and my all time favorite scene where Harry finds out that he's the one who saves them and not his father, was executed beautifully on screen.  I can't wait to watch it a thousand times on my DVD.
0393317552|5.0|This book is fantastic!  Jared Diamond manages to achieve the impossible by somehow covering thousands of years of human history in just enough detail to be fascinating but not overwhelming.  He doesn't just touch on, but truly explores such wide-ranging topics as agriculture, technology, politics, psychology, and biology to name a few.  These diverse subjects all are interwoven in a fluid, easy to understand style, which manages to explain even the most complex ideas using simple concepts and definitions.  I felt smarter with every page turned!<br />His extensive background in anthropology is reinforced by a strong understanding of how things interact and relate with one another, and this is the central argument of understanding the history of modern humanity.  I truly enjoyed reading it, and found myself applying knowledge from it in everyday life - rather amazing for a book about societies long extinct and geographically far removed from my current existence!
B000002KKS|5.0|There is no doubt that Ronnie James Dio was a great singer. And Probably superior to Ozzie (i mean \\"technically\\"...).

0765301598|4.0|There seem to be alot of complaints from serious Dune fans, that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are ruining Frank Herbert's vision of the Dune universe.  I will agree to a certain extent that these works are nowhere near as complex and well written as the original Dune series, and that Brian and Kevin seem to have taken certain liberites with Frank Herbert's vision of the Dune universe; changing certain aspects to fit into their storyline.  That being said however, these works are an enjoyable read.  As I said, these books cannot, and should not be compared to the original works, which are truly great works of LITERATURE, for these are not works of literature, but rather, serial novels designed more to entertain than enlighten.  These books admirably accomplish this goal, and when viewed in this light, and taken for what they are, one can appreciate what Brian and Kevin are trying to accomplish.  As a huge fan of Frank Herbert's original series, I for one welcome any continuation of the Dune universe, so long as the continuation keeps me entertained. <br /> <br />Rather than nit-pick and scream that these books do a disservice to the original series, I would encourage all fans Frank Herbert's Dune to view these books for their entertainment value, rather than their literary value, and simply enjoy them for what they are.

B00005JMX6|1.0|man, what the hell people. Dumbass movie from the word go. I know I say this but its the truth in my eyes. You got a kid whose passion is towards a girl who happens to be a porn star and thats when it goes dumb...literally. IT just spirals down into the oblivion of bad comedys and this is one of the worst of 2004. Who would of guessed Timothy Olyphant (GO, A Man Apart) and James Remar (Drugstore Cowboy, 48HRS.)  in this movie? I certainly didnt until the 2 showed up on screen. You know Elisha Cuthbert is cute and all but is suffers from shear stupidity and boredom. Also starring Jacob Young (tv's All My Children), Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano (Taking Lives). Stear clear from this junk pile people...you deserve better.
B00000I3JM|5.0|No 'Blue Nile' disc has exactly 'burst' upon the scene. 'A Walk Across The Rooftops' simply descended in 1983, tantalisingly & dreamily evoking a young man's urban vision, even his rite of passage. The lyrics have that envious quality of being at once both generalised enough for our empathy and intimating the detail of a particular place. Some call this 'the real'. 'Astral Weeks' has it. Richard Buckner's,'The Hill' has it. Of course it's not the measure of all pop music, nor should it be. But it can make for enduring pleasure. Pound for pound this, by quite some way, is the better of the 3 discs I've heard. Buchanan's joy de vive is more evident for one thing. There's a playfulness in the scoring that feels a tad more predictable in the succeeding discs. There's the title tune,'Rags To Riches', 'Stay', and 'Automobile'; it's quite a musical panorama with The Blue Nile's signature string orchestra lightly woven throughout. When ready to spin this type of music in the 80s I'd debate over this or David Sylvan's 'Brilliant Trees'. I harbour affection for 'Trees' but it hasn't continued to warm me like The Nile.
B000000H4A|5.0|It's fun!  It's freaky!  It's funky! It's Insaaaaaaaaaaane!  It's King Diamond's debut, Fatal Portrait!  You can't call yourself a King Diamond fan and not own this.  Most of what I read says that Abigail is when they truly found their sound, but whether the sound is found or not, this album is great.  Off the top of my head I can't even think of one filler song on here, though some may disagree.  As his career went on, King Diamond would use multiple singing voices on his albums, but on this one he's using the trademark falsetto about 98% of the time.  You have to be some kind of communist schmuck if you're not singing along with this catchy tunes by the end of the song.  Very highly recommended.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|Donna Summer is as synonymous with disco as the Statue of Liberty is with New York City. While, in hindsight, it is her work with co-producer Giorgio Moroder that has become the most enduring and indispensable, this neat, single-disc compilation does suggest that Summer is more than just a disco diva. \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" rocks along briskly with its gospel-inflected tones; \\"Hot Stuff\\" and \\"Bad Girls\\" display a definite rock sensibility at work. Of course, her unashamedly hedonistic disco numbers provide the real treats here. <br /> <br />Summer comes across as nothing less than a crazed sexpot on the opening track \\"Love To Love You Baby\\"; ditto \\"I Feel Love\\". Yet her formula works wonders: to produce adrenalized, synthesizer-driven disco tracks combined with punchy musical arrangements and a rather good voice to boot. This collection proves that Donna Summer not only refreshed the world of disco - and, indeed, took it to new levels of excess - but also that her confident sound has become a staple of twentieth-century music.

B000001FKY|5.0|Well at the time,  1987,  it was a long long time after Pyromania.  Many critics didnt think Def Leppard could attain that level of superstardom once again.  And it took a while before the album got a #1 single with 'Pour some sugar on me' but once it hit it was a monster.  Millions of albums sold and Def Leppard topped themselves big time.           Very strong songs,  spacious,  soulful,  well produced,  its a stunning piece of work.  My only small knock on it is they went a bit overboard with the music videos....about 7 of them.  That small knock aside,  its an amazing album.  Truly one of rock n rolls greatest,  grab it today and pour some sugar!!!
B00004XQP4|5.0|Gimme Blood,Sex n Booze n Take me to Church on Sunday!
B00000I07P|4.0|I wasnt the biggest Bon Jovi fan when this record came out....but I must admit....its a damn good record.  Very soulful rock songs,  well produced,  quite a piece of work.  When it came out it was such a hit that the record company was pumping out a million records A WEEK.  And that is some volume. <br /> <br /> <br />     So if you like good rock n roll....go pick it up!!
1400082773|5.0|This book was great. I couldnt stop reading it. I read this nearly 500 page book in 3 days and was sad when he finished his self discovery which ended with his trip to Kenya. It was clear and the writing was very fluid. This is an excellent first book for Obama and I hope he continues to write more. This will defintely be a classic some day.
B00005Q66T|3.0|Madonna's GHV2 is an odd package. First, there's the clunky title - why not \\"THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION VOL. 2\\"? Then there's the scattershot song order; unlike THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION, these tracks aren't arranged chronologically. Selections from 1992's EROTICA sit next to tracks from 1998's RAY OF LIGHT and 1994's BEDTIME STORIES with little regard for continuity.     This isn't a big deal, though: what bugs even more is the song selection. Hits like \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" and \\"American Pie\\" are all salvaged for the inferior \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\", the incongruous \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", and the flaccid \\"Drowned World\\". (Not that \\"American Pie\\" is a very good song, but \\"Drowned World\\" wasn't even a single, for pete's sake.) Surely there was room for a few more hits - the disc has only 15 tracks, more than half of which are radio edits.    But for its considerable quirks, GHV2 is still a worthy buy if you don't feel like plunking down cash for the albums. Compiled here are some of the best pop singles of the '90s, from an artist whose music has remained steadily solid throughout a rocky (and controversial) career path. Danceable, emotional, spiritual, and even intellectual, the songs on GHV2 are an essential addition to any sensible music fan's collection.    My advice: Put together your own mix of Madonna's post-IMMACULATE work, give it a cool name, and leave GHV2 on the shelf.
B00005CDUE|5.0|This CD is obviously not meant for the Roxy Music fan, but rather is meant as an hors d'oeuvre platter for those wanting to sample their music.<br /><br />In that regard this album is perfect.  It is jam packed with music. Every one of their albums is represented on this CD providing a listener a reasonable way to find out 'which' version of Roxy Music they find themselves drawn to.<br /><br />After owning this for about a month, I had a good sense of which songs I liked and went and bought the album that those songs came from - Siren - and now a few months later am happily listening to their first album Roxy Music.<br /><br />This band is extremely difficult to approach.  It is one of the greatest aquired tastes in pop music (especially their earlier stuff) and I highly recommend this album for anybody interested in them, but overwhelmed by how to approach getting into them.
B00005J6T0|4.0|While Madonna's 1989 opus LIKE A PRAYER always seems to make it onto the Top 100 Albums lists, I think TRUE BLUE is the better album. Spawning a remarkable 5 hit singles, TRUE BLUE hits all the right notes: it's party-hearty and mellow, hedonistic and emotional. And unlike most of Madonna's records, the album tracks don't suffer in comparison to the singles: \\"White Heat\\", \\"Where's The Party\\", \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" and \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" are all solid numbers.  <br /> <br />Even so, the singles are what make TRUE BLUE a worthy purchase. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" are catchy and highly danceable without being moronic (the former's anti-abortion message is certainly heavier that most Top 40 fare, especially for the '80s). \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is a delightful Latin-tinged excursion, and the album's title track is the best song the Supremes never recorded. Then, of course, there's \\"Live To Tell\\", a gorgeously atmospheric ballad that ranks with Madonna's best.  <br /> <br />TRUE BLUE is a solid piece of '80s pop that holds up extremely well. If you're looking to beef up your CD collection with the Material Mom's back catalogue, start with this one.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If 1/10 of the material Michael Moore has presented is true, it would be a damming indictment of the Bush administration.  Moore's policatal position is clear and this is a documentary with a strong left wing bias.  However, the issues he raises should be discussed as widely as possible (not much chance).  The sad thing is, most of what he says has a strong element of truth.  The relationship between Bush and the Saudi ruling class for example,must be examined further.
B0001AP12G|5.0|kanye west is the best rap artist out right now. akon comes in second place. this album is near perfect in production. kanye's flow is aight, but what gets me is that most of the songs are really catchy. drivin down the street to tunes such as slow jamz (featuring twista), through the wire, we don't care, jesus walks, and family business will have you rappin and singin along with kanye and da crew until the end. you can't go wrong with this CD. <br />  <br />the songs you NEED to hear: <br /> <br />we dont care <br />through the wire <br />family business <br />never let me down <br />jesus walks <br />slow jamz <br /> <br />while there are no bad songs, i guarantee at least a couple you wont like...but that goes for any CD that you'll ever buy. <br />21 tracks in all, about 4 or 5 skits....... a couple are mad funny. best commercial rap album out now....and one last thing....this cd has more than just rap....it mixes in some r&b, and soul elements as well.... <br />but hands down....this is not a CD you'll want to miss out on having.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|The subtle deviations from reality and the outright lies in this movie are so plentiful and are now so well documented that I don't see why anyone still talks about this \\"documentary\\" (as far as documentaries go This Is Spinal Tap had a firmer foundation in the truth than does Moore's film).  This is nothing more than an irrational \\"I hate Bush and I don't care if I'm logical about my argument because my hatred is enough to make my feelings valid\\" vehicle for people who don't want to think and prefer to just surrender their minds to any popular demogogue. Read Dave Kopel's (a 2000 Nader supporter like Moore was) \\"Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11\\" article to see just how baseless and devoid of any real facts this movie is.
0784011397|1.0|This came on the TV the other night. (TNT)I had not seen it before so I watched. Sylvester Stallion is still quiet handsome! But the movie was sickening and disgusting especially after 9/11, I'm simply amazed they still show it. It is in such bad taste! It is bad enough Rambo joins the mujjahadeen (\\"holy warriors\\") who gave us the Taliban and Al-Quaida and 9/11. And the Russian soldiers are very badly represented. First of all, Russia did not \\"invade\\" Afghanistan, but were asked to help by the Afghan goverment against the mujjahadeen rebels. The Russians in the movie all look like gigantic pro-wrestlers or something! Do you want to see how the Russian soldiers really looked? Get the book called \\"Afghanistan, Soviet Vietnam\\" by Vladimir Tamarov. You will see, they were eighteen or nineteen years old skinny boys who looked sixteen. The mujjahadeen were the same vicious Islamist extremists fighting our American guys in Iraq and Afganistan today, so thanks for nothing, Rambo. I'm still amazed this movie still plays on the TV. TNT is clueless.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I saw this movie in the theaters 6 times. It took a while to get into the entire plot, since there are many things which I notice each time I go back, that I hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />this movie captures that weird \\"you and me\\" feeling of being unsure in love, and deciding to just leap into it. It's very touching in many places.<br /><br />This is the movie which makes Jim Carrey into a \\"real\\" actor, not the Truman Show. Kate Winslet continues to portray the zeitgeist of womanly roles that makes her so dynamic.<br /><br />One thing which I tire of is the office hijinks of the Lacuna people..the subplot regarding the doctor and someone else doesn't really retain it's humor or punch under repeated viewings, although the plot demands repeated viewings.<br /><br />Typical Kaufman: mostly pitch perfect, but slightly off. but still daring and fresh.<br /><br />I don't own a DVD player but I am going to buy one now, so that I can buy this movie and watch it when it comes out.
087033039X|5.0|Bought this at a Tandy store many years ago and had to replace it recently (made the \\"mistake\\" of loaning it out). I bought this instead of Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding. by Bruce Grant. While the other book may be good, the price tag made me balk and not being able to actually flip through it first made me wonder about if it was worth the money.<br /><br />This was well worth it. I was able to take the techniques and use them to make a flail using both suede lace and plastic lace. The instructions are clear and concise. Instructions are given for many different projects.<br /><br />If you do leatherwork, this is a good addition to your collection!
B00005JNEI|5.0|moore lets bush, cheney et al hang themselves on their own words.  liars!
0316168815|1.0|This book was a huge dissapointment! I was intrigued about reading the story of Susie Salmon, speaking of her death and her family from Heaven.  <br /> <br />I found, however, that the characters didn't seem real to me. The character development was so poor that by the time I finished the book I was like, \\"So what!\\". What a waste of my time and money.  <br /> <br />I am not sure what all the hype was about... this book just didn't do it for me. I was waiting for it to get good at any time, but it totally let me down.
B00000IL29|5.0|Pianist Herbie Hancock took the sea as a theme, composed five outstanding pieces, invited an all-star cast of musicians to join him, and created a masterpiece.  Each of the compositions, the lilting \\"Maiden Voyage,\\" the turbulent \\"Eye of the Hurricane,\\" the moody \\"Little One,\\" the complex \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" and the lovely \\"Dophin Dance,\\" can either stand alone or fit perfectly together as a suite.  Herbie Hancock is quite simply one of the best pianist of all time.  Every solo I have ever heard him play is logically, meticulously constructed, but played with passion.  George Coleman is an underrated tenor saxophonist who amply displays his talent here.  Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard plays with his usual fire and clarity.  Rhythm sections don't get any better than Ron Carter and Tony Williams.  When this music was first released on LP it proved to be very popular.  I believe it still is.  It deserves to be!
0316776963|5.0|I read this book straight through as I waited to be called for jury duty and laughed harder than I can ever remember.  Caution: this book may offend more sensitive readers -- I probably wouldn't recommend it to my mother -- but this book is so unforgettably funny that I might even show her some of the stories -- such as the title story, where a class of students try to explain the death of Jesus to each other in broken French.  Just thinking about it makes me want to read the book again.
B00004Z459|1.0|My friend adored this CD. We're in our early teenagerhood. He said I should buy it, so I did. I listened to it twice, then grabbed an empty pillow case, tossed it in, and snapped it with my hands.  <br /> <br />Since when are whiny lyrics cool?  <br /> <br />The only songs I vaguely remember from this were 'Crawling' and 'Papercut', and a whole bunch of other drivel about how life sucks and parents suck and everything sucks. <br /> <br />So let's review the ones I remember, shall we?  <br /> <br />-Crawling: Tell me if these lyrics sound cool to you. <br /> <br />\\"Crawling in my skin, these wounds they will not heal, fear is how I fall, consuming what is real.\\"  <br /> <br />They are repeated far too many times (at least four in a three or four minute song?). Compare to the chorus of a favorite song of mine, repeated, oh, five times in a ten-minute song: <br /> <br />\\"My fall will be for you  <br />My love will be in you  <br />If you be the one to cut me  <br />I`ll bleed forever\\" <br /> <br />Now make one whiny(and half-spoken) and one reverent and operatic. <br /> <br />You see why Linkin Park sucks? Repetitive vocals, unimpressive guitars and drums, the STUPID RAP stuff that is completely terrible, whiny lyrics, and a sound so commercialized and processed that it has no power at all.  <br /> <br />I'm ashamed with my 15-year-old friend for liking this complete tripe.  <br /> <br />You like rich people singing about how much life sucks? Good, open your mouth to be force-fed by the music industry.
B00003CXCT|1.0|How can you rate this at all? It is August 25, 2004 and its not even released yet. I give it 1 star because I was forced to pick something.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I like what this movie tries to do. Basically, they took the complexity of Donnie Darko and dumbed it down for a wider audience. It's a good movie, but only if you can handle cheesy plot twists. I didn't take this movie seriously when I watched it and was therefore able to enjoy it. It's time machine meets Donnie Darko.
B0002IU988|5.0|I was anticipating the release of \\"One Day Remains\\" but I was blown away at how awesome the album was. The writing it great and the melodies are moving. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes great music. Mark Tremonti has dug into himself and pulled out a masterpiece.
0887306667|5.0|It is important to know that the knowledge from a person who is actually working in the industry.  Otherwise you would not be sure if the information actually work for you or not.  This author is a real thing and so is his knowledge.  I recommend that you read other books that is written by real working author like Gerrilla PR.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Like watching whales swim underwater- graceful, beautiful, and, well, slow- this movie floats heavily across the screen leaving you touched and smiling. The story of a leader among a people who can't see past her sex, a tale of remembering and returning to what you came from, and a lesson in acceptance.<br /><br />Director Niki Caro simply presents Maori culture to the audience without any bulky explanations or excess subtitles. While some of the symbolism was a little heavy-handed, Caro nicely shows the decay of the people and where Koro's (the main character Pai's grandfather) motivation comes from.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed with refreshing realism, the narrative is fantastic, and it's well shot. While it may be a bit slow going for some people, the film offers hope and leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling few films offer anymore.
4789004546|5.0|The book explains grammar matters very thourously, impeccably published and is really convenient to use (the things you might need had been sought after). It is, however, not a good way to  bootstrap yourself into the language, so to speak, you probably need to have decent grammar knowledge to get the most out of it. Since you'll be there sometime, the book is worth to buy anyway ^_^ <br /> <br />I haven't said something spectacular in my review, I mainly wrote it because the book is really good and you don't want to miss it.
1592400876|4.0|This is a far better book than one would expect.  Its light fare and can be easily read at one's convenience.  However, I can not help but feel that Bill Bryson's book about the English language are far better.  Also, the author tends to go off on starnge tangents.  (Opal Fruits?)
B0002OOUP0|4.0|So does anyone really need an additional compilation of the Rolling Stones?  The only reason I bought this disc was in search of great sound quality for a CD instead of a SACD.  I am satisfied with this.  I was too cheap to buy the import that has been available for many years.  It's good to hear Mick, the young man's voice on some of the tracks.  The sound quality is not as great as on the hybrid SACD's from the 60's.  On the other hand, the sound quality is much better than on the overpriced \\"Forty Licks\\".
0800141806|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time.Tom Hanks(in a powerful performance that won him his first Oscar)plays Andrew Beckett,a lawyer who gets fired from his job because he has has AIDS.While his boss tells him he was fired for incompetence,Andy knows the truth and goes to find any lawyer to support him in court.Eventually,Joe Miller(Denzel Washington)finally takes the cases,despite the fact he is prejudice against people like Andy, <br />but after he gets to know him and see him as a person, they eventually they become friends.Overall,a powerful movie that is filled with brillant performances.And while Denzel Washington does a good job,Tom Hanks is clearly the best actor in the film.I recommend this movie!!!!!  <br />
B000002UB6|5.0|For those who don't know the story, the tension and frustration experienced by The Beatles during the \\"White Album\\" sessions reached new heights during the GET BACK sessions.  In an attempt to bring spirit to the band, Paul was pushing to have The Beatles play live again.  Perhaps his thinking was that playing together (as they used to do) would reunite them (as they used to be).  Instead, there was much talk of breaking up.  It was decided that the group should at least rehearse together while being filmed, but George Harrison actually walked out and quit the group for a few days.  Apparently what John said regarding The Beatles at this time was indeed a group reality: \\"It had become a job.\\"<br /><br />Excluding the filming that took place at Twickenham Studios (brought to a close by tension within the band and George's walkout), the GET BACK sessions began on January 22, 1969, and ended just nine days later, all of it taking place at the band's Apple headquarters rather than Abbey Road studios.  Although The Beatles behaved a little better when keyboardist Billy Preston was brought in, the sessions did not go well, being mostly jamming--meandering from song to song.  As George Martin appropriately pointed out, \\"they were rudderless at this time.\\"  Martin was not on hand for much of this, and even when he was present, it is unclear how involved he was.  Engineer Glyn Johns was asked to compile the album--not George Martin.  Though Johns complied, the ill-fated GET BACK was never given the group's stamp of approval and was left unreleased for over a year.<br /><br />In January 1970--after the release of the glorious ABBEY ROAD but prior to Phil Spector's involvement--Glyn Johns was given another shot at compiling the album, but this turned out to be another futile attempt to make presentable the sessions that Paul has called \\"the break-up of The Beatles on film.\\"<br /><br />Early in 1969, Allen Klein became involved with The Beatles; it was agreed (excepting Paul) that he should run the group's finances and business affairs.  Klein, who profited from any additional Beatles releases, was the most likely impetus behind the release of LET IT BE and the involvement of Phil Spector, with whom Klein had worked previously.  Klein was notorious for bringing in his own people; George Harrison himself recalled that it was in fact Allen Klein who suggested to John and George that they should have Spector listen to the tapes.  John and George, being Spector fans, certainly approved of the idea.  So unbeknown to Paul or George Martin, Phil Spector was brought in to have a go at it.  Martin recalled that it was all very sneaky and done behind people's backs at a time when \\"Allen Klein was running John.\\"<br /><br />Spector produced the LET IT BE album in seven days, beginning on March 23, 1970, and ending April 2.  His version involved many edits and an abundance of remixing.  The orchestrated overdubs on \\"Across The Universe,\\" \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" were done in one session--the arrangements were by Richard Hewson, not Spector.  Two songs on LET IT BE did not come from the GET BACK sessions.  John's vocal on \\"Across The Universe,\\" along with some of the rhythm instruments, came from the original takes recorded in February 1968; and \\"I Me Mine\\" was recorded in January 1970, a full year after the project.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think that the GET BACK sessions were particularly great, nor do I think that they should be trivialized.  Although the performances are perhaps not quite representative of what The Beatles were capable of, the songs themselves are strong enough to overcome these less-than-ideal renditions.  Spector essentially took the music from the rehearsal-like sessions, dressed it up, and powdered its nose.  I never did believe that the orchestra and choir added to \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" turned Paul's song into something phony.  This great song holds up under Spector's treatment, and I'm glad thatPaul finally admitted it wasn't so bad: \\"I don't think it made it the worst record ever.\\"<br /><br />I enjoy Spector's LET IT BE and think it worthy of a five-star rating, probably because I'm such a Beatles fanatic.  My gripes, however, are that (1) the recordings of \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" released as the single should have made the album (instead, Spector's mix is solid but inferior on \\"Get Back,\\" and he sidestepped \\"Don't Let Me Down\\"); and (2) the mix of \\"Let It Be\\" that became the single is superior to the one on the album, and I also prefer George's guitar solo on the single.<br /><br />LET IT BE... NAKED, the latest attempt at presenting the material, does not address the inherent problems with the GET BACK sessions--the reasons that caused them to be rejected in the first place.  Instead, this cleaned-up version again exposes a band that was focusing more on problems than on music.  Why is LET IT BE thought by many to be the group's weakest effort, and ABBEY ROAD (recorded a few months later) thought by many to be one of the greatest rock albums ever made?  I think it is clear that in the case of the latter, (1) the band members put aside their differences to focus on the music; and (2) George Martin was allowed to fully work his magic.<br /><br />Without getting into further details and writing pages here, suffice it to say that I will always wish that George Martin had been given a serious shot at producing this album from the beginning.  Maybe then we would have had another Beatles masterpiece.glad that Paul finally admitted it wasn't so bad: \\"I don't think it made it the worst record ever.\\" <br /> <br />I enjoy Spector's LET IT BE and think it worthy of a five-star rating, probably because I'm such a Beatles fanatic.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Winner of 7 Oscars,Schinder's List is clearly Spielberg's masterpiece!From the first scene untill the final shot,this film will have mesmerized by the brillant performances,the haunting score by John Williams,and the great story that is so moving that you'll  burst into tears.Overall,truly one of the best films of it's kind. I recommend this film.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Terrible movie, Michael Moore twisted the facts to his own personal views. The story is not based on the actual facts, it is based on one sided view, which does not give you a balance of opinion. It is base on one focus political view. Clever on manipulating the facts. I recommend not even to waste your time see it.
B000268QB2|5.0|Uplifting, thoughtful, happy, sad, inspiring, clever, catchy, edgy, compulsive...you'll play again and again and again and 'see something new' every time....Indie-pop at its very very best.  <br /> <br />This album is just SUPERB can't wait for their next offering. <br /> <br />Terry

B000286RNY|4.0|After three years of sitting on Shaolin Soccer, Miramax has finally released the movie to a quick theatrical run before dumping it onto DVD. I guess we should be thankful that they've offered fans a subtitled version as well as a dubbed one. Sadly, none of the extras available on the Asian DVDs are included.<br /><br />There are no extras to speak of. Not to mention there have been some changes to the songs on the soundtrack and a few cuts here and there.<br /><br />Shaolin Soccer is an entertaining romp that deserves to be as hugely successful here as it was in its native country. While the print looks good, the lack of extras makes the Asian version the one worth tracking down for fans of this movie.
B00004VVND|4.0|I remember being packed up in the car and going with my parents (I was about 3 and they couldn't get a sitter) to see this movie at a drive in!   <br /> <br />Drive in's are, sadly, pretty much a thing of the past but I'm glad to see this movie's still around!  This is the first movie I remember seeing, and if it's been stuck in my head for all this time then there's got to be something good about it!!
B0002IQHZM|4.0|I couldn't help but stereotype what I expected from Donovan having listened to his music for about 40 years. I stand corrected. The songs and arrangements on this cd are timeless. Its a fusion of acoustic jazz with mystic poetry and crystalline voice that echos throughout the ages. Its cool.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The day this DVD is released will mark the end of rational as we know it. I can't believe that FOX has caved in to this nutcase formerly known as George Lucas.  <br /> <br />George Lucas sold his soul to the Devil a long time ago when he decided that what God had originally given him was less than a masterpiece. Now he's just a wandering fool. He doesn't know his left foot from the right anymore. How could he have lost faith is something that so many people have cherished? Why discard all the memories of so many childhoods? GREED maybe? Just pure MADNESS? <br /> <br />I also tried to write several 1-star reviews, but got rejected by Amazon on all occasions. Take advantage of the public, pick our pockets clean, don't give a crap if the product is a worthless piece of garbage, just keep shoving it down our throat like it's the Holy Grail. Shame on you Amazon.com for hiding the truth.  <br /> <br />MY ADVICE: <br />George Lucas - Save your soul and just release the ORIGINALS!!! <br />Fox Studios - Next time just say NO to any egotistical idiot that wants to only release the \\"revised editions.\\" <br />Amazon.com - Stop RIGGING the joint 'cause everyone knows you're a FAKE. <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is an artist who is hot right now because he is good, not because he got shot 6 or 7 times. His lyrics have meaning and doesnt just say how much money he has or how many hoes hes had sex with. In his songs, he says how he feels and does it with a style that no other rapper has brought to the table. This CD is very good and you wont get sick of it anytime quick. <br />-dave
0765301598|3.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this book. Anybody who reads this has already read the first two books in this series so should already know what he or she will find here. Sure, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue wooden, but you knew that already. The situations are moderately interesting and the writing competent, if uninspired. And, as far as new Dune books go, this is as good as it gets. Literally. Unlike other science fiction franchises such as Star Wars, where there are a large number of writers of variable talent at work, Anderson and Herbert are it as far as the Dune universe goes. It's them or nothing.     So, take this book for what it is, a moderately entertaining addition to a once-great series. Try not to think too much about what might have been and enjoy what we have.
B00009Z574|3.0|_Tormato_ is a strange beast in the Yes collection.  Often criticized as one of their worst studio albums (_Union_ and _Open Your Eyes_ usually take Top Honors), it simultaneously deserves sharp criticism as well as warm accolades.  \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is the highlight of the album--truly worthy of being called a Yes \\"classic.\\"  It's not as if the other songs on the album are terrible--they really aren't--but the overall sound is often cluttered with Howe and Wakeman playing too many notes at the same time.  Wakeman's keyboard sounds also border on cheesy/annoying way too often.  This is definitely a Yes album I would *not* want someone who is unfamiliar with the band to ever hear. <br /> <br />The Remastered/Expanded version of the album is a vast improvement.  The \\"original\\" album sounds a lot sharper and clearer.  The first two bonus tracks -- \\"Abilene\\" and \\"Money\\" -- were included on the 1991 boxset \\"YesYears,\\" and probably would have *improved* _Tormato_ if included on the original album.  \\"Abilene\\" is a very pretty, simple song--the rare (if only?) Howe-only penned Yes song.  With all of these remastered/expanded Yes albums coming out and the band on tour, it'd be nice if they dusted off a song like this and performed it live as a special treat for diehard fans.  \\"Money\\" shows a welcome humorous side to Yes.   <br /> <br />The other \\"bonus\\" tracks include the beautiful melody of \\"Picasso\\" (a snippet originally performed a capella by Anderson on the \\"YesYears\\" video from '91), as well as early demo versions of Anderson's \\"Some Are Born\\" (which would appear on his 1980 solo album _Song of Seven_) and \\"Does It Really Happen\\" (titled \\"Everybody's Song\\").  \\"You Can Be Saved\\" is a curious little piece, sung by Squire and Anderson with some atmospheric keyboards; think material that Squire probably would've included on a follow-up to _Fish Out of Water_.  \\"High\\" and \\"Days\\" are pleasant, but not much more.  \\"Countryside\\" would later appear as an instrumental on Howe's _Turbulence_ (1989), so it's interesting to hear this version with vocals from Howe and Anderson.   <br /> <br />If you *hated* _Tormato_, you probably won't find much to like here.  If you are on the fence about the album or love it, this is worth picking up. <br /> <br />Original _Tormato_ album: 2.5 Stars <br />Remastered/Expanded CD: 4 Stars
B00005JNEI|1.0|Liberal Propangandistic Lies ... The worst part is that so many people in our country are so uninformed, they will believe this propaganda film. God Bless America and President George W. Bush.
B00005JNEI|5.0|A film definitely worth seeing for lively debate with open- minded people. The documentary IS Michael Moore's opinion and I don't believe everything he says, but sometimes exaggeration is needed to create balance.  I saw this film twice and felt that it did an exceptionally good job at portraying the extensive suffering of war...man's inhumanity to man to man made my heart ache, open and grieve.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, and Timothy Olyphant star in this  <br />teen comedy/romance and completely burn up the screen.  The film has been compared to 1983's \\"Risky Business\\" and rightfully so.  However, Luke Greenfield puts together a film that far outweighs it's comparison.  The story opens with high school senior and soon to be graduate Matthew Kidman (Hirsch) realizing that as his school years come to an end he has yet to experience any of the crazy, glorious memories that high school should provide.  He is the good son, scholar student, class president though relatively unknown.  This soon changes with the arrival of a new next door neighbor Danielle (Cuthbert).  Seeking to start a new life away from the \\"adult film\\" industry, Danielle has moved with plans to be a normal 19yr old college student.  Though away from the cameras, Danielle's passion for living on the edge has not dulled. Matthew and Danielle become the object of each other's desires and insanity. And from their first moment on screen together, the movie slams into a hilarious ride of love, lust, revenge, and quiet morality.   <br />Hirsch and Cuthbert are a perfect match for their characters; as is Olyphant who plays a devious porn producer named, Kelly.  Typical for him, he receives two thumbs up in this supporting role. <br />If you have enjoyed recent teen comedies such as \\"Eurotrip,\\" \\"Grind,\\" or the \\"American Pie\\" series, then you will love \\"The Girl Next Door.\\"  This unrated version is far better than the one seen in theaters.  The DVD is loaded with extras including: deleted scenes, original ending, commentaries, featurettes, and more.  Though a teen comedy in the typical fashion of today, \\"The Girl Next Door\\" brings more depth and magic to the screen thanks to an awesome cast and crew. Drop this one in your cart or wish list today.
0060977264|3.0|I read this book in one day.  It was enjoyable, I really liked the religious element.  But I do feel it lacked depth and character development.  All in all I liked it, but I would definitely buy it used or borrow it.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I think the new enhanced versions are worth the price of the DVD set, but it would have been nice for them to have included all the movie permutations.  My desire is based on my fond memories from the 70's of the original movie that I saw in the theater almost 20 times.  In fact a lot of us old timers saw it multiple times and that is what helped to make Star Wars such a cash cow.  You'd think Lucus would show some appreciation for that and include what we remember best.  Bummer!
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Alan Parsons has never been one to conform to traditional album format or currently popular genre melding. Rather, as the title of this new disc suggests, he moves alone down a path of his own choosing, ever changing, ever strivng, always uniquely intriguing. Here Parsons toys with everything from drum loop club beats to dissonant jazz fusion as he pushes the envelope of his own invention even further down the path of musical experimentation. Interestingly, while forging ahead into new areas of computer-oriented composition and production, Parsons twice looks back along the way to see just where it is that he has come from, and the perspective of that vista shows us all just how far he has traveled over the last three decades. As always, very highly recommended for anyone with an open mind as well as open ears.
0688170528|5.0|This is one of those books I didn't want to put down, but at the same time, didn't want to end. I grew to know the characters so well, that I talked about them as though they were my own neighbors and couldn't help but worry that I might ever be in their shoes.<br /><br />This is a fabulously written novel with a well-thought-out plot that pulls the reader through to the end. But even more importantly, this is a story every parent should read and be forced to answer the question, \\"how well do you know your children?\\"<br /><br />I can say with certainty, \\"The Pact,\\" by Jodi Picoult is the best book I've read this year.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I have always been a big fan of Alan Parsons' music and when it was brought to my attention that a new record was coming out I was thrilled! Well, I purchased \\"A Vaild Path\\" and needless to say I am quite dissappointed. Alans' previous effort \\"THe Time Machine\\" is such an enjoyable record that the release of his new project would lead fans to believe that \\"A Valid Path\\" would pickup where \\"The Time Macine\\" left off. WRONG. Gone are mainstays Ian Bairnson and Stuart Elloitt. They are sorely missed throughout the record. All I would like to include is if you've been a fan of the work of Alan Parsons' throughout the \\"Project\\" days and his solo work, this CD is not for you.
B00005JMAH|5.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN may be the most controversial and contested film in the series (barring the still unfathomable conservative Christian opposition to the inital release of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE). New director Alfonso Cuaron, taking over from Chris Columbus, makes a beautiful film seeped in cold blue and silver hues,  plays contrast with light and shadow, and explores a recurring symbol of reflections. The cast, under his direction, give their best performances yet. The film is, overall, a tight, tense roller coaster. <br /> <br />So why are so many people decrying this as the weakest entry? Surely, the first film moved too slowly in places, and the second suffered from too many characters. Film three improves over all this. The problem lies in how much of the book was excised in order to trim the film down. The fans say that it's just too different from the book. And they do have a point. A film is different from a book. Even when the book's author writes, directs, and edits a film version, it will never be an exact replica of the novel someone experienced while reading it. A director's first priority is to the film, not the book. He has to make the best film he can (and in this case, he assuredly did). <br /> <br />HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, is not the same as HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, written by J.K. Rowling. If you cannot be happy with an adaptation unless it is exactly the same as the novel, I'm afraid all you can do is never watch an adaptation ever again. <br /> <br />Either that or stop reading.
B00006DEFA|4.0|After not having seen \\"Amadeus\\" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it. <br /> <br />First the good... <br /> <br />The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. \\"Elvira Madigan\\", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became \\"the Elvira Madigan theme\\". <br /> <br />The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place. <br /> <br />Now for the bad... <br /> <br />The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. <br /> <br />Mozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life. <br /> <br />Salieri's portrayal as a mediocrecomposer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt. <br /> <br />Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for \\"the spa\\" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle. <br /> <br />Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious \\"man in gray\\" who intended to pass the work off as his own. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 4 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|I was very excited when I finally found a copy of this in the USA at a Sam Goody store.  I bought it for a high price but its worth it.  Anthony funks up already known songs and releases 2 new ones which are great.  Not to mention John and Flea's playing as well as Chad.  I also bought this album b.c this past summer I was in London the same two days there were performing at Hyde Park and we kept driving past there but the sucky thing was at the time I wasn't aware of their presence there!  Lol. <br />Well, anyway...This is a very good 1st Live album.  With different sounds, same sounds and new songs. <br /> <br />
0553288105|4.0|This book stands alone among Asimov's Science Fiction works.  About the only thing that could be considered even closely related to this book is The End of Eternity.  No Robots, no Foundation, no Empire.  Its been quite awhile since I've read the book, and the person I lent it to never returned it, so I'll have to go off memory... but, the things I remember most about the book are: 1) The character who discovers the window into the other dimension - the kind of guy you love to hate; 2) The aliens from the other dimension - they are so bizarre, it is cool.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Well the first thing anyone reviewing this cd has to mention is the guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler who are just awesome, they are extremely talented and are way better than almost all guitarists around these days. They solos, they play great riffs and they have great tech and rhythm sections. The guitars are very Slayer/Meshuggah influenced expecially the driving Meshuggah-like rhythms behind the solo in the title track or the awesome breakdown in Ruin among others. The drummer is fairly unremarkable but this is coming from someone with very high standards. He is pretty good thats for sure though. Bass is hard to hear on this cd so i wont rate it, it only comes out as a constant rumble in the background (which is probably all it is!) so it wouldn't be fair. <br /> <br />Well I've heard the first cd but i don't own it yet and there are improvements, many improvements but a few gripes. The vocals aren't fantastic, on New American Gospel, Randy Blythe screamed really well, he was really hardcore. Here he sounds like he is just saying the vocals, which is weird because it sounds like he's growling kind of. It's really hard to explain. I think it is a growl but very high pitched. On the bright side though, the production is much better but still keeps a raw side to it, the production on the first one was just crap, it's not cool it doesn't make me think they are any better than they actually are! (*stares at black metal cds menacingly wondering what obsesses them into using crappy production*). They guitar parts are more technical as well. <br /> <br />The songs are great, they don't get boring but they aren't as heavy as people say. I mean I used to think these guys were heavy a long time ago when I first heard 11th Hour, I think I still listened to crap back then though, I can imagine how heavy nu-metal or thrash fans would think this is, no offence but it just ain't heavy. Ruin, 11th Hour amongst others stand out off the top of my head. <br />I couldn't say this fully deserved Album of the Year 2003, mainly because I haven't heard much of the popular TALENTED music from that year, I was still digging into the depths of old Death Metal cds at the time i think, lol :). But this is bloody good I tell ya! If you're a musician, you will really be able to appreciate the guitarists, if not, they riffs sound really cool so you would like it anyway.  <br /> <br />This doesn't really appeal to a particular genre of fans but I suppose you could call this Metalcore. Overall it's something you need to check out, they are very popular and deserve to be so don't be afraid to fork out a few dollars for it! :D
0553565915|5.0|This book is beautiful and when I read it for me I felt it was all true at the very core of my being. At some level it was almost as if I remembered as she described what she expereinced. It gave me great comfort. She does tell us why she was in the hospital, she was there to give birth to her child. After childbirth she was placed in a recovery room. She bled to \\"death\\" and was unable to call for help. And this is how she starts her journey into the afterlife. I believe Ms. Eadie's story. My own story of how my daughter came into my life is also proof of this. To me, it all makes sense.  I still go back and re-read sections of this little book.
B00003CXCT|3.0|First off, you cant give it one star or 5 stars because it's not out yet. It's not clear at this time if we're going to get the re-released version done a few years back or a completely new re-release that we've never seen before. <br /> <br />I really only had a few problems with the \\"Special Edition\\" releases: <br /> <br />1) Greedo did NOT shoot first. OK? It was poorly edited, looked bad and made you think Han was never in any real danger. <br /> <br />2) The Jabba scene added to Star Wars was not needed. The dialog was all repeated from the Greedo scene and Jabba, frankly, looked TERRIBLE. Nothing at all like the original from Jedi or the cleaned up version from Phantom Menace. <br /> <br />3) The rancor scene from Jedi looked just as bad as it did back in 1983. What's the deal? You make a lot of noise about cleaning up the effects in the movies and that scene is left untouched? Come on... <br /> <br />It's possible the DVD will fix these problems, it's possible that it won't. But the fact is we don't know until it comes out and any review that says \\"It's the best\\" or \\"It's the worst\\" has no basis in reality.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Prog rock is admittedly an exploration of musical textures - its supposed to be interesting, and YES make a very good effort in this album in that direction.  Some of the best prog bands measure up to some of the best jazz esembles.  To hold them to a standard of absolute music is simply a lazy approach to claiming knowledge of music.  Just listen to any of the Miles Davis \\"bands\\" of the mid fifties and sixties.  Tales is simply interesting, well worth the effort - and listen to it more than twice.  Have fun with it.
B00022LRXA|5.0|There are many people who belive that 'Here Come the Warm Jets' is Eno's best album & there are an equal amount of people who are behind 'Another Green World', but I believe Eno's true masterpeice is 'Before and After Science'. It utilizes everything that was great about Brian Eno, from his fast paced glam rock to his slow, meditative confessionals, and even leaves room for some ambient music(which Eno invented). Whereas 'Here Comes the...' was sometimes overflowing with too much \\"glam\\", and 'Another...' was slightly overdoing it with the ambience/instrumentals, 'Before and...' strikes just the right balance. The first side is mostly in the same vein as 'Here Comes...' with some fabulous songs like \\"Kings Lead Hat\\". Side 2 on the other hand is THE gratest side of music in rock history. It is basically a mix of what Eno experimented with on Side 2 of David Bowie's 'Low' and what he himself did on 'Another Green World'. Every song on Side 2 has shimmering beauty that I have never heard anywhere else. 'Here he Comes', 'Julie With...', 'By This River', & 'Spider and I' are all perfect songs, and 'Through Hollow Lands' is one of Eno's most beautiful instrumentals (along with Sombre Reptiles, Becalmed, & anything off 'Music for Airports). Even though Eno made around 6 other classic solo albums (Another,Here Come,Taking Tiger Mountain,& Ambient 1,3,&4), I have always felt the 'Before and After Science is not only his greatest achievement, but one of the most amazing recordings in rock history. Do yourself a favor and buy it now!
B0000047EC|5.0|I beg you to completly ignore that review from the English chap.  OUt to lunch, in my opinion.  THis is one of the most beautifull cds I have ever listened to, not boring, beautifull.  So, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Behold this masterpiece and enjoy it the rest fo your life.  Two masters combine to create this pearl.
B00006879E|1.0|This band is the crapiest one out there. All of their lyrics are cliche and meaningless. The airtime these guys get on the radio is so incredibly much that they practically own music stations. This band is also very one-dimensional. All they do is sing about love and garbage like that. I cannot believe this is considered rock. This should be classified with Britney Spears and other garbage.
0131103628|5.0|Many reviewers have noted that K&R2 isn't well-suited to the needs of a real beginner. I was in the same position and found Steve Summit's online \\"class notes\\" a useful introduction, along with his supplemental notes to K&R2.
B00008973A|5.0|People! Come on, this movie is wonderful. I grew up watchiing it over and over. It is good from start to finish, and yes if you are wondering I have seen the on stage version. Both were terrific. I dare you not to be humming the tunes the next day. Five stars for sure!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002I25|5.0|this is one of the best cd i ever heard of my life. In fact, i only heard 6 cds in my life. Anyways, you shouldn't buy this special offer because it is a heck lot of money for this crap of what is called a cd instead buy an ipod loser!
B0002IQHZM|5.0|I really won't even get into the music, without even a listen this would be a 5 star album just because its Donovan.  Donovan is the greatest songwriter of all time so therefore everything he puts out is 5 stars.  He has out done himself once again.  This is an album very similar to Open road seeing that some of these songs were written around the time of Open Road.  All I can say is buy it, BUY IT NOW, IT WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR CD PLAYER FOR MONTHS!!!!!!! The Enchanted Gypsyo from Scotland is back with authority, the album will knock you on your ass!!!!!  \\"O MAEVE MAEVE MAEVE MA LOVER, SAKKA PAKKA RAKKA PAKKA TEEE, O MAEVE MAEVE MAEVE MA LOVER, SAKKA PAKKA RAKKA PAKKA TEEE, LOVE FLOATS IN SPACE, THAT SPACE BETWEEN US\\"
B00005UQ9F|1.0|This movie really really sucked.  It made no sense and half of the movie was focused on this guy's face with his mouth ajar.  Anybody who actually understood this plot had to have been either high or completely out of their mind.  I had high expectations for this movie but it is cinematic garbage that should be burned for the betterment of Hollywood.  Just when you think the movie has absolutely no point, it ends the way it started...horribly.  The main character turns out to be possessed by one of the multiple personalities that one of the previous inmates of the asylum possessed.  The ending possesses many implications towards society in that it is stated that this evil personality haunts all of us...Oh no!  I will never sleep again. Seriously though this movie was a total waste of everything.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is one of the best movies of the last decade, and possibly even in the history of cinema. It is a movie that speaks to the soul, a film that connects with the deepest stirrings of humanity that every man, woman, and child harbors within them. It is not a fun movie; by no means is this a piece of entertainment. But it is art, a powerful, engaging, harrowing piece of art that will be remembered for its brutality and honesty for years to come. <br /> <br />The film follows four people in Brooklyn, all in some way trapped in addiction: Sara, a middle-aged woman who gets a call that she is going to be on television, and in an effort to reclaim a time of lost happiness, goes on diet pills to fit into the dress she wore at her son's graduation; Harry, her son, who has become addicted to heroin after high school and quests with his friend Tyrone to get a pound of uncut heroin; the aforementioned Tyrone, who has slipped into drugs to remember the comfort of his dead mother; and Marion, Harry's girlfriend, who slips into sexual decadence to get money for her addiction as Tyrone and Harry's plan falls through. The four begin at a stage when everything is easy, and slowly they spiral into the hell of addiction, always clinging to the hope that it will be as good as it once was. <br /> <br />The movie is beautifully shot, with Aronofsky's trademark rapid montage style being used to good effect here. The score is one of the best I've ever heard, played to perfection by the impeccable Kronos Quartet. And the acting, my god, the acting. <br />Each of the principal performers gives a tour de force performance, truly capturing the joy and despair of addiction.  <br /> <br />As Aronofsky himself said of Hubert Selby, Jr., the author of the novel on which this film is based, there is light and darkness. And this film is about the darkness. But its there, with a flashlight, searching for our humanity in that darkness. And that is the kind of film any filmmaker shouldaspire to make. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|In the whole movie I was captured.  It had a great meaning to it all.  It had clever characters and great anime.  I loved it so much, I gave one to my neice and now it's one of her favorite movies.  Its a must buy!
B000060P79|4.0|Ok. When I first started out listening to music, i was into bands like Blink, MxPx, NFG and Simple Plan. It basically started me into getting to like pop-punk material which slowly merged into other genres of music. In the past three years, my taste has developed to not just include the less-known, \\"underground\\" music, but this stuff as well. I think that SP is great in their own right, not to mention a pretty friggen fun live band. My advice to anyone truely wanting to get into music is to not just focus on one genre, but to be more open minded as well. Experiment. Check out different types of punk, old school and new. Dont just buy what is topping the charts, check out older stuff as well. Check out different bands that you hear coming to local shows, and dont just give them one listen and decide from that, listen repetitively and try to get an idea of what the artist/band is really trying to get across. That is my reccomendation to anyone just getting into music, and if anyone would just get that concept, i think we could tear down the walls between hardcore punkers, poppy high-school listeners, ska kids, metalheads, reggae, and the all around worst, rap fanatics. I think that if people would just be a little more open minded, things would just be a lot easier. Holy cow, that was a lot of preaching
1400032717|3.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book. I bought it because it has half price, had a unique title and an interesting cover. I thought the book was pretty good but the story could have been better. I am going to complain that almost every sentence begins with \\"And\\". I know it is supposed to represent how Christopher's mind works, but it aggravated me. What I did learn from the book is that I am not well suited to be the parent of an autistic child. I really didn't like Christopher at all. The book made me appreciate what a struggle it is for these parents. The book also made my fear of having an autistic child grow a lot.  <br />Last thing, the book really isn't about a curious incident of a dog in the nighttime.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|Non-stop action and excellent special effects with enough plot and humor to keep it interesting.  I hope there is a sequel.
B00008EYA5|1.0|A totally unimpressive adaptation of the original TV series with a strictly coventional PC screenplay and, to my surprise, horribly dull and unimaginative action sequences.  The only good thing about this film is that it was short.    This film isn't even enough for a plot overview: the only thing to remember about it really is that it was small, annoying, and it stunk.  Although I like good action, there's no action worthy of acclaim here: the action was actually better in the original TV series if you can believe that.  The action was bad not only for the fact that it was rather sterile and bloodless, but it wasn't even imaginative as to the types of tactical situations a SWAT team might encounter. Actually, with the kind of plot they had in this film, it would have been more interesting if it was another Die Hard or Dirty Harry film with a solo cop out on a rampage.    You may like this type of action if you're 14 or younger but this sorry film doesn't do it for me: it's just too shallow, predictable, and completely unengaging. The old TV series are better.
B00005R2M3|3.0|For foreign artists who've become superstars singing in their native language, English crossovers are always a bit sketchy. It's especially rocky when the artist is famous for their exceptional lyricism and hope to transfer their skills over to a language they just barely learned. When the idea to present Colombian pop-rock queen Shakira for an English crossover came up in 1998, Gloria Estefan and her producer husband, Emilio, offered to write songs for her. However, she politely refused and instead dived into learning the language and writing on her own. The result is Laundry Service, a slick pop record on the outside but uneven and awkwardly structured when stripped down. It's not a bad album; this is Shakira after all, quite possibly the best Latin pop star in the world right now. But certainly in comparison to her Spanish work, the songs here pale heavily in comparison. Sure, Laundry Service does have its good moments- the Andean-inspired pop ditty \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and the rocking \\"Objection\\"- but for the most part she stumbles over trying to create an artistic tapestry of words in a language that she just barely began speaking. But one can't hold that against her,- just take one listen to Donde Estan Los Ladrones? and it's certain that the girl is ridiculously talented. If anything, Laundry Service is a promise of what might come and a reiteration at just how stunning her previous work is.
0195067142|3.0|This is a pretty well written book with some very good descriptions of combat, however I was unable to overcome a feeling that Sledge managed to avoid the serious front line combat the riflemen were going through.  He always seemed to be behind the line lobbing morter shells while the other Marines were pinned down on the front lines. I don't mean any disrespect because I'm sure there were cooks getting killed on these islands. Just an observation

B00028HBKM|5.0|...at my local theater. Yes that's right, K. Weld. And Mel not only put forth the last twelve hours of Jesus' life, but he also implemented his own style and thought into it and that's why I applaud this film. Every Jesus film I have ever seen has been dull. The director is afraid to implement style or substance beyond the scripture or connect any dotted lines and then here comes Mel Gibson, whom does so while not sacrificing story in the least. I'm not saying forget a detail about a scripture or change anything, but don't be afraid to imply something thematically. Don't just let the camera catch everything that the scriptures says and...that's it.  This is what filmmaking is all about. Mel Gibson represents all that Hollywood lacks in this horrible decade of film. He is a go-getter. I have studied the scriptures a long time and the pain stakingly miniscule details he put in are amazing. Some of Jesus' quotes that Mel applied are buried deep within the New Testament where only the intense readers would know and add beautiful authenticity to the film.
B00005JMYG|5.0|Seriously, I mean come on. Yes i know the plot may have not been the greatest. But it still had a plot. For those of you who didn't catch the plot, it's about a woman who tries to overcome the glass ceiling put on women in the 70's. But I didn't see the movie multiple times because of the plot, but because I wanted to laugh hysterically, which I did. S.Alix if you wanted to have more about the rivalry between the news teams you should have watched a documentary. Darcie B, it has a PG-13 rating for a reason. If you look in the box where the rating is it'll tell you why the movie got the rating it got. I've seen plenty of PG-13 movies that were worse content wise than Anchorman. Titanic for example. And P.Kitts, why did you even bothering reviewing the movie. If you haven't even seen the whole thing you shouldn't review it \\"FROM WHAT I SAW IT WAS TOTALLY DUMB. I saw some previews and that was all I wanted to see.\\" Anchorman was by far the best one liner movie I have ever seen. There are so many classic lines, way too many to list. The only character i didn't really care for was Champ, the sports anchor. The first time I saw it i didn't like Brick, but the second time i grew to like his character. But anyways, I loved this movie and I'm definitely picking this one up on DVD.
B000002WYT|1.0|Essential recording?? I can't believe it! Geek, just let me laugh...!! If there's something in American music that sounds dull, anemic, meaningless, flat, un-heroic, then you have Dave Matthews and his group. Here is a prime example of an album (and a band) extremely overrated. It begins with the poor first song, 'So Much To Say', that reminds me of the least interesting stuff of late 70's - early 80's, 'middle of the road' and 'middle class' songwriting which is forgettable but not quite forgivable. How music can be so dull, so alarmingly dull that they should provide a free alarm clock with each copy of their album! The Dave Matthews Band's formula is not a stroke of genius, in a word they did not invent (or re-invent) the wheel. It is amalgam of annoying commercial Pop, with a bit of Country, Folk, Blues, Jazz and Rock, but then they don't play any of those styles with satisfactory results. Their mixture stinks. It doesnt work. Tasteless, flattened, uncolored. The DMB is not as good as a fraction of the best bands, boys! Talk about the Stones, the Beatles, the Byrds, Fleetwood Mac, etc., etc... No wonder they're down with the current Democratic presidential candidate---to whom they should dedicate their song 'Say Goodbye'
B00006879E|4.0|Good music. If you like this you'd like Joe Sneva. [...]  I think he used to open for Maroon 5.
B000003TA4|2.0|While this is definately the best of Nirvana's albums, it is *just* tolerable. I can not believe the praise this band has recieved, how can a band with so little talent get to be so popular and 'critically acclaimed'? <br /> <br />Some of the praise they recieve is just absurd, 'The Beatles of our Generation'? Give me a break, the Beatles actually had a decent guitarist (George Harrison), each of their records was a classic and they actually changed music for the BETTER. They also pushed new musical boundries and didn't recycle their own work over and over. What do we have to thank for after the grunge movement? Just look at the corporate 'top 40' crap being shoved down our consumer throats. 'Badass' rap, r&b (those words have lost all meaning), bubblegum pop, generic punk rock and generally music that rides on image not actual talent. Music has no substance today, bands with real talent are few and far between. Thanks a lot Kurt, thanks a bunch. <br /> <br />As for the actual content. The music is fairly simple, painful vocals (nails on a chalkboard painful) and rambling lyrics. A lyrical genius? Since when does 'i dont care i dont care i dont care i dont mind i dont mind x 50' and 'A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido' (must have had his rhyming dictionary handy) constitute as lyrical genius? I'm sure people are looking for meaning everywhere, so the lyrics are very 'meaningful' to them. Simply throw the word 'god' in, add a few 'teenage issues', play some repetitive guitar, screech like you are a hungry child in Africa, wear torn jeans and presto, you sound like Nirvana.  <br /> <br />Worst of all, this music makes you feel depressed. Who actually LIKES feeling depressed? Do you really want to listen to someone crying about their 'teenage angst'. Just look at Nirvana's fans, i'm not making generalisations here, but look at the people dancing in some of their film clips. One word comes to mind: zombies. Generic people with generic teen problems listening togeneric music with no emotion, no expression whatsoever. <br /> <br />Generic... a word explaining all too well the music scene today.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|The movie is an entertaining yet gut wrenching story of the first super model Gia Marie Carangi.  Gia is unfortunately known for being the first female public persona to die from contracting the AIDS virus at the age of twenty six.  When Gia passed in 1986 little was known about AIDS. Radioactive suits were used for AIDS patients and it was considered the \\"gay plaque\\".   Gia was born in Philly and the first to walk the catwalk in a boisterous style.  She was also a pioneer being a brunette in the modeling world of \\"Marsha freakin' Brady\\" `s.      \\"... heaven on earth   back again  into  under  far in between  through it    in it    and above...\\" from Gia's journal    This movie chronicles Gia's relationships to family, friends, photographers, other models and drugs. This roller coaster of a movie is not for the faint of heart or close minded. Her rise to stardom and downward spiral take you by the hand every step of the way.  Your heart goes out to the wise cracking model, almost daring you not to fall for her yourself, despite her heroin addiction.  Her attempts of recovery and living as a house wife (\\"Mrs Doodiekins\\") are both endearing and entertaining.  This is one of the first movies that I actually spoke to the screen, \\"NO GIA!\\" \\"You go girl!\\", etc.    I can not say enough about Angelina Jolie's acting of the ill fated model.  All sides of this complex character are shown.  Charming, lovable, destructive, stubborn, it's all there!   Jolie's performance in this HBO movie earned her the Golden Globe award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Emmy nomination.  Elizabeth Mitchell's performance as Linda is underrated and worth props. Mercedes Ruehl is excellent in everything she does, this is no exception.  Ruehl plays Gia's \\"absent\\" mother Kathleen Carangi.  Faye Dunaway  is superb as the sympathetic modeling agent Wilhemina Cooper.  Thinking back on the movie, not one bad performance in the bunch.        Now that you know the basics of a \\"movie review\\" are covered,  here is the real reason I am writing.  I owned the \\"R\\" rated version of this movie on DVD and was curious to know what the added five minutes of footage contained.  I searched the internet and could not find the information anywhere.  If you are interested like I was this may be helpful to you.  Granted I have not seen the \\"R\\" version in a while but these are the scenes I spotted.  (no spoilers in case you have not seen this movie)    The black and white chain link fence scene Between Gia and Linda is longer and more graphic.  The scene inside studio 54 has a couple more seconds including more sex and drug use.  Gia goes to \\"score\\" from Satellite in the red dress and Geisha make-up, the motor cycle ride is longer.  The shower scene where Linda is \\"cleaning up\\" Gia is a little longer.      That is all the difference I saw.  If I missed anything, I`m sorry.   If you like the movie half as much as I did, buy it.  It's inexpensive, and worth so much.
B000003TAR|1.0|Oh the irony of the opening line of the album. I'm sure it did pay them well... in bucket loads of cash. Now grown out of his teenage angst, Kurt finds more creative things to whine about (i guess that's what the critics mean by this album being 'more artistic'). 'In Utero' is much less tolerable than 'Nevermind' (an album verging on the borders of tolerability). So if you feel the need to listen to more faceless, depressing music with irritable whinging look no further!<br /><br />The unremarkable opening track is followed by 'Scentless Apprentice'. What can i say... i'd rather chew on a roll of al-foil than listen to this song. There's a fine line between emotional singing and plain old screeching. I simply cannot listen to this song without hitting skip. The fun doesn't stop there, when listening to 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' or 'Tourette's' please keep a bucket handy as you'll most likely feel the urge to puke. The rest of the album is the same old. That being said, there are a few songs i tolerate, they are 'Heart Shaped Box', 'All Apologies' and 'Very Ape' which has good guitar but is ruined by Kurt's whining.<br /><br />This isn't party music by any means, who would want to hear 'Rape Me' at a party? Why couldn't Kurt just lighten up once in a while?<br /><br />The only thing this music does is rape your ears, the only way it makes you feel is low, depressed, like crap. Is this the kind of music you want to be listening to?
B000053V7Q|5.0|For those of us unlucky enough not to be of concert-going age when Elvis was at his peak, this is the closest you will get to being in the audience at one of his concerts.  This Elvis is my favorite Elvis-the 1970-Las Vegas-International Hotel Elvis.  He was perfect at this time.  His voice was maturing as was his choice of material.  He looked amazing.  Don't let anyone fool you.  The '70s Elvis (except for maybe '75 through his death in '77) is perfect.  And you know what, in the context of a show, the jumpsuits totally work.  (Treat yourself and visit Graceland for an up-close look at some of the most spectacular '70s costumes he wore.)  I love this DVD.
B0002DB52M|5.0|This movie was spectacularly super amazing! It was almost like Our Town, in that it was set as a play... which caught me off guard and was weird... but I eventually learned to love this about the film and it complemented it well. <br /> <br />The story is very good and I got so into it and this is at like 5 in the morning when I can't sleep but almost am... I was just wide awake! You kind of get so emotionally raped by this movie because it plays with you like it knows it can and the ending is just so gratifying... I jumped up and said, \\"Yes!\\" <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman gives an amazing performance... perhaps her best beisdes a Virgina Wolfe character, which she won an Academy Award for. Another stand out in this movie was Paul Bettany who plays Tom Edison Jr. He is definitely a great up and coming actor. Lauren Bacall gives a great performance, as well. Finally, Patricia Clarkson, a fabulous actress, was just sensational. And there's anothe rlittle nice actor in there that I can't mention so as not ruin a surprise. <br /> <br />The beauty fo this movie was that it wasn't your typical feature film. Some may find in ignorance that it was cheap and boring, but I say find some culture. This picture is truly magnificent. <br /> <br />Dogville gets 5 stars and is rated as one of my favorite movies of all time now! <br />
B000001GPX|4.0|Carlos Kleiber died in July and they're mourning his death in Europe. Some are saying the greatest conductor on the planet is gone with no one to replace him.<br /><br />I can't agree with that although I would say the combination of these two symphonies was perfectly mated to this conductor's musical sensibilities. Kleiber was a no nonsense literalist that drove his music and players very hard. You hear his unrelenting drive and momentum throughout this CD, especially in the outer movements of the Fifth Symphony.<br /><br />You can also hear in its his recording of the Brahms Fourth Symphony and in his accompaniment to Sviatoslav Richter's performance of the Dvorak Piano Concerto, both also on DG compact disks. This trenchant characteristic was the trademark of the younger Kleiber. For me it worked less well in other music but worked magnificently well in these symphonies.<br /><br />There is no question this is a very great CD of some of the world's most perfect music. The recording shows its age a bit with a lack of definition from timpani and lower strings. Still, this is a fine production that exceeds most others in pure visceral energy, drive and motivation.<br /><br />In recent years, I thought the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies were the very best of the period performance set performed in Zurich and conducted by David Zinman. Those recordings have much of the charge and delivery of this issue without the superhuman drive. They also have a clarity and texture better than this recording.<br /><br />No matter since this CD is embedded in the memory of just about every classical music fan in the world it will continue to carry its Olympian reputation. It will undoubtedly now be enlarged to greater legendary status each year with the passing of the late Mr. Kleiber.<br /><br />I don't think that conductor was a man for all music but he was certainly on his game in 1975 and 1976 when he recorded these symphonies. Beethoven is almost always done well in recordings, since his music tends to transcend poor performance. But rarely is it done this well.ecordings, since his music tends to transcend poor performance. But rarely is it done this well.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This film was something. Beats the pants off Harry potter etc... or am I just showing my age?. I will buy this for my children. It still holds all it's charms so many years on.  I adored it and watched it many times over. It is great to see that so many others appreciated it as much as me.    I was talking today with an Australian girl at work about this movie, she leaped about and started dancing and singing the tunes from it.  Do i need to say anymore?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I feel like an idiot. My Dad kept trying to tell me just how good this show was when it was on and I just wouldn't listen. Now I just finished watching the whole series in one sitting. I was totally enraptured as I watched the crew of Serenity make their way through the 'verse. I can only take comfort in the fact that I am not nearly as stupid as the morons at Fox who seem to have no idea what makes a good show. I can't wait for the new movie in April. Thank you, Universal, for putting Firefly back out in the Black where it belongs. Here's hoping for a return of the series!!!

0006547745|2.0|When you start reading \\"From the Holy Mountain\\", you tend to be enthralled by the author's style, and by the detailed description of the places he visited, following in the foot-steps of John Moschos...And this is what happened to me, until I reached the Chapter describing his trip to Lebanon : there, I had to change my mind, as it occurred to me that the author was a phony!<br />Let me explain myself : the road that Dalrymple claims to have taken to reach Bsharre is an old road, which has nothing to do with the modern road, and he must have read about it in an old book! The modern road does not turn towards the mountains immediately after Jebeil(Byblos), but goes past Jebeil, along the coast through Batroun , Chekka, Enfe and then towards Amioun...Now, Amioun  happens to be the \\"capital\\" of Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon, where there are many interesting places to visit, some of them going back to the Byzantine era. But he ignores Amioun completely, as if he did not hear about it...<br />On the other hand, he claims to have reached the \\"line of snow\\" a little before reaching Bsharre : but, according to him, this journey took place on the 4th of October!! However, it never snows in Lebanon before mid-November, and even then, it is not at so low an altitude(1300 meters), but only on the high mountains, above 2500 meters. This is another proof that he never made this trip, except in his imagination. And if this is not proof enough that he his making the whole thing up, he claims to have continued his trip , over the mountains, to Baalbek in the Beqaa valley. Well, the road that leads to the Bekaa valley from Bsharre is usually closed all winter, and definitely whenever there is any snow at the altitude of Bsharre. There is no question about it: his trip never took place as stated.<br />I will spare the reader all the other details that add up to prove that this author is not trustworthy, at least as far as his trip to Lebanon is concerned.And don't believe anything he says about the Lebanese civil war : he is repeating, like a parrot, what Robert Fisk told him ( and R.Fisk is known for his anti-Maronite bias).s about the Lebanese civil war : he is repeating, like a parrot, what Robert Fisk told him ( and R.Fisk is known for his anti-Maronite bias).
B000286RNY|4.0|Shaolin Soccer is really a terrific piece of cinematic fun. It's at times hilarous, at times marvelous (while some special effects are obvious, some are seemless, and all of the martial-arts-style-soccer sequences in the film are breathtaking). It's a very comic-book style story of a group of Shaolin monks who have had to abandon the order to make a living. Steven Chow (the star, writer, and director of this Hong Kong Academy Award winning film) brings them together when he discovers that Shaolin can be used to play soccer! Together the reunited brothers take on team after team, under their former-soccer-star-turned-gimp coach played by Ng Man Tat, eventually challenging Team Evil, run by an evil beurocratic former soccer player who has a long history with the Shaolin team's coach. The road they travel, though, is filled with gag after gag and frequent displays of impressive Martial Arts action. There is an interesting quasi-romance story on the side featuring Chow and the beautiful Vicki Zhao (who is made up in the film to have growths all over her face) that was almost entirely cut out in the American theatrical run, but it's a very interesting story that provides a great character ark for Zhao.<br /><br />When, as I mentioned before, Miramax presented Shaolin Soccer for theatrical release, it was in the form of a sliced-and-diced (re-edited hack job) that really undermined the intellegence behind the slapstick in Shaolin Soccer. Character development was reduced to nill and relationships lost meaning. Signs were translated into English through poor utiliazation of CGI. Still, it was great to see parts of the film on the big screen.<br /><br />For DVD, though, Miramax provides both it's U.S. Theatrical version and the infinitely superior Original Chinese version (actually the extended version) on one reasonably priced DVD. The DVD, though containing 0 special features, is beautiful! I didn't bother watching the U.S. version (and neither will you, if you have any sense about you) but the 112 minute chinese version of the film is presented in a beatiful, almost faultless transfer. Sharpness is great, contrast is right on, grain is reduced, color balance is as good as one could hope for. It's a BIG improvement, visually, over the HK Universe DVD released a few years ago.<br /><br />While the film might not fit everyone's taste, it's worth checking out for anyone. At least give it a rental and check out the original Chinese version, but I encourage you to take my advice and buy it now, as 90% of you will fall in love with the film once you see it. If you saw the film in theaters, regardless of whether you liked it then check out this disc! If you somehow liked the theatrical version, you'll fall head-over-heels in love with the original version. And if you didn't, I'm pretty sure the original version will surprise and fulfill you in ways the U.S. cut could not.<br /><br />I don't give this film five stars because, while it's one of hte most entertaining films I've seen, the slapstick goes over the top a little too much for my tastes during a couple of instances. They're still funny, however, and the rest of it is so good that you can easily forgive those moments.<br /><br />Go get it!ny sense about you) but the 112 minute chinese version of the film is presented in a beatiful, almost faultless transfer.

0061015725|5.0|I would have to aggree with previous reviewers here who say that Prey is not as good as some of Crichton's previous novels. However, it's just as supsensful as you'd expect from this author; I couldn't put it down. Part of what makes the book so suspensful is that the \\"villian\\" - the swarm of faceless nanoparticles - is one that is unfamiliar to us. Some of the scientific explanations get a bit dry and hard to understand, but it's easy to skim through those parts and move on back to the story.
B000094DUP|5.0|A fantastic album of Delta's. Each song has a unique style and sound and tells a very emotional story that will draw you in. The vocals are extremely strong, music is touching and the lyrics are very catchy. No wonder why Delta has sold over 2million albums and been recoginised with so many astonishing awards.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This is an excellent CD for people who like jazz and easy listening music.  Renee Oldstead's voice is so soothing and pleasant  My favorite track is A Love that Will Last.  It is a very romantic and optimistic  song.  I love her cover of the song Midnight at The Oasis so much.  Her voice is so silky smooth that I forgot who sang the original.  Renee has such great chemistry especially on her duet Breaking Up is Hard To Do with Chris Cinotti.  They sound as though they are singing this song about each other.  The piano playing on this track is so good too. Renee sounds so sexy and tempting on the song Meet Me Midnight.  I really enjoyed this song.  The trumpet playing on this song accompanies  her voice well.  I was blown away with Renee's performance of Summertime on this album.  She sings this tune appropriately and so well with a slow, subtle, sultry quality.  It is hard to believe that she is just a teenager.  Her vocal performance on the song Sentimental Journey is so good.  It makes me want to find my true love.  Renee Oldstead is a wonderful new singer with so much talent.  I loved this listening to this album.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Liberals complain about right-wing lies. What do you think this movie is? A WASTE OF TIME
B000002J1O|5.0|This is their best album. If you like Genesis buy this. If you Prog rock buy this. If you like rock buy this. If you like music buy this. If you like life, by this. I reallyt mean it, this is as close to perfection as music has come (apart from Collins vocals) . There are other albums as well, but this is one of them, the ending is the most beautiful of any album ever. <br /> That's how I feel, but for you the buyer that isn't very constructive for you. If you like like Genesis get this, yes that is fair enough but the rst was a bit extreme.  <br /> I feel their should be a difference between prog rock and art rock, and this album should be the pinicle of art rock. It displaysmany forms of music in one and yet sounds complete, solid and a rock of an album.  <br /> If you want to get in to Genesis, buy this, if you already are, I'm suprised you don't have it already. <br /> I hope I've been useful... Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it.)
B00005JMUA|5.0|Uma Thurman absolutely kicks butt in this movie!  Even though the film is a bit tamer than the first, this installment is presented more as a psychological thriller/western-type thing rather than just a hack 'n slasher.  The best part of this movie has to be the grave sequence...where \\"the Bride\\" is buried alive by one of her many enemies.  You are made to feel as if you are right there with Uma as she struggles to get out of the wooden coffin she's in.  Tarantino does a great job in carrying out this sequence...and it sends chills up your spine!  And of course, who could forget the death of Elle Driver!  Now that was classic!  Elle was absolutely wonderful in this movie too...and gave \\"the Bride\\" a good run for her money...and her life!!  She will be sorely missed! <br /> <br />Go out today and get this one!  It is most excellent!
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I am a big fan of Harry Potter, Ron Weasly, Hermione Granger. I think the movie was really good cause there was more excitement than the other ones cause this one harry had to fight the dementors and save Buckbeak. I know the next movie is going to be better than movie but who cares cause they are all good books and you know that the movie is going to be good cause all the books are good. I can't wait till the last 2 books come out. <br />

The writing was exquisite, and Obama's reflections on race and identity were so compelling and thoughtful--not just for transracial families, like mine, but for anyone who thinks that race continues to be one of the most central issues in our country. <br /> <br />Can't recommend it highly enough.

B00028HBKM|5.0|There is no way anyone can watch this movie and not be changed. It brought me back to God and church, and I can only hope Mel Gibson makes another movie on the subject. Amazing, beautiful, tragic, moving, and totally uplifting. This movie is only violent if you dont understand the message and the reason for the sacrifice.....
0385336810|4.0|Actually it's 3 1/2 stars. This is the first book I've read by Kinsella and wasn't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews I've read (I always sort with lowest ratings!). I was surprised that I enjoyed it and that it reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones' Diary.<br /><br />Yes, it is campy, predictable, unrealistic, and shallow. However, it is also fun and quirky. I read to escape not compare lives....which is why I was able to enjoy it.
006092988X|4.0|This novel can look imposing for the casual reader. However, the story is so wonderful and the writing is so enjoyable, that most people will rediscover this great book and realize why it is such a classic of American literature.  <br />The characters are \\"alive\\" for the reader. The Nolans are a family that could be any of us. Betty Smith must have felt these characters in her soul, because, they are that real! I tend to believe that Smith based these characters on her own personal experiences.  <br />Some moments of this novel will have you tearing up, some moments will have you cheering ( the christmas tree scene), and other moments will make you angry at the injustice that seemed so prevelant at the time. <br />In this time of cultural excess and flomboyant bounty, it is a good reminder of how this country was at one time, not nearly so bountiful. When the \\"working class\\" lived in poverty. Much could be argued about the politics of the working class today, but we all have to admit that the \\"working class\\" of America is not living in the poverty and hard times of the early 1900's. <br /> <br />This novel was a joy to read. I will recommend it to many others. Enjoy! <br />

0385510438|5.0|I say that The Last Juror is better than the last two novels he came out with. Now The Last Juror is not another Grisham novel with a young lawyer in trouble or knows a secret he knows and takes the money and run to a nice island to Grand Cayman Islands. The Last Juror takes place in the 70's in Ford County; Grisham returns to Ford County since the release A Time To Kill. Now this time, instead of a lawyer, a newspaper writer gets into the murder and trial for the murder of Rhonda by Danny Padgett who Rhonda didn't accept a dance from him, so he murdered her in front of her children. Now, Wiley (the owner of Ford County Times) grabs the trial and is there from the beginning to the end. Danny is eventually sent to prison in life; in the 70's life only meant 8 years, during the post-trial, Wiley keeps reporting the local stories, hangs out with a couple of Vietnam Vets who love poker, yet they always invite Wiley to play since he always loses. It is then that Danny is released from prison, and goes on a killing spree when he told the jury that sentenced him to life, three juror's are killed, and immediately Danny is fingered for the killings of the jurors. At first the book starts out slow, slow like A Painted House slow, but Grisham lets the story simmer and the last 50 pages I thought were the best he has ever written. If you are looking for a good book that is slow, but yet suspensul? Get this book!
B0000041ZT|5.0|Although he was much better known as a composer of symphonies, fifteen in all (the most of any major composer since Beethoven), many of them large and bold, Dmitri Shostakovich had moments where he could be light-hearted.  Given that he worked under the watchful eyes of the Soviet Communist Party and that tyrant of Iron Curtain political correctness Joseph Stalin, this is nothing short of a miracle.  This album of \\"jazz music\\", all of which was composed in the 1920s and 1930s, demonstrates Shostakovich's more \\"light-hearted\\" side. <br /> <br />The works featured here include the composer's First Piano Concerto (with pianist Ronald Brautigam and trumpeter Peter Masseurs), the famous Tahiti Trot, and the two Jazz Suites that Shostakovich composed in 1934 and 1938 respectively.  Each of the four works gives us the knowledge that Shostakovich knew how to be wickedly subversive and humorous under severe conditions, though it is not necessarily \\"jazz music\\" the way Americans might think.  There are twists in these works, as well: for example, the jaunty Foxtrot of the Jazz Suite No. 1 incorporates what sounds like a Dobro (more commonly associated with American bluegrass and country music). <br /> <br />The Jazz Suite No. 2, of course, contains the famous Second Waltz in the key of C Minor that director Stanley Kubrick used for his final film, the psychosexual drama EYES WIDE SHUT, in 1999.  In fact, this very recording, by Riccardo Chailly and the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, is the one that Kubrick used.  It has a salon feel to it, and has as much in common with Johann Strauss' classic waltz style as it does with Shostakovich's own individualistic approach to things. <br /> <br />Both Brautigam and Masseurs are brilliant in the Concerto, and Chailly and the Concertgebouw demonstrate the kind of orchestral brilliance that serves them as well in this lesser-known Shostakovich collection as it does in their Bruckner and Mahler sojourns.  It comes highly recommended as an unusual look into how great music with humor could be created under extreme circumstances.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I enjoyed this film. It made me laugh and also made me sad because of some of the truths it brought out about our president.  Of course it is biased, overwrought, and serves the political purpose of the director, Democrats, and Mr. Kerry.  The republicans are upset about it, and would like it suppressed  and understandably so.  Now we have the Swift Boat book and TV ads with the exact same reaction from the Democrats. I am sure there is in truth it also; but again it is overwrought and written for a political purpose. How can each party be so upset at one of these pieces of propaganda and embrace the other?
B00006CXSS|1.0|Don't buy this.  Buy \\" Saving Private Ryan\\".  I watched disc one and found the script to be difficult to follow and disorganized.  I couldn't determine the main character and was disturbed by the shifts in time ( let's start with 1944, let's go back in time, let's go forward in time, etc.) What is the plot ?  Why do we care about the characters ? What is their background ?  I expect to have clues to the answers to such questions in disc 1. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|2.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was wondering what movie I went to see.  The movie was hurried and choppy.  So much of the important story line was left out.  I knew I wasn't the only one when leaving the theater I overheard lots of people that didn't read the book asking questions about the movie.  Plus, it was very difficult to get into a movie that changed everything from its predecessors.  The total change of the castle and grounds brought the image of the kids going to a different school.  Honestly, I really hated the movie at that point considering I felt it ripped my favorite book to shreds.<br /><br />To be fair, I did go see the movie a second time.  I did like the movie a little better.  Why?  Probably because I could pay a little more attention to things that were happening because I wasn't in shock from the differences.  I still don't like some of the main elements of the book being left out.  And, personally, the lighting of the movie, reminded me of old movies like \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\"<br /><br />I think the director could have dealt better with adding a bit of \\"realism\\" and keeping true to the books.  I don't think his heart was in the right place of being true to Harry Potter.  He just wanted to create a \\"masterpiece.\\"<br /><br />Will I own the DVD?  Of course... what Harry Potter fan wouldn't?  However, I know it won't be viewed as much as the other films.
B0002IU988|4.0|Alter Bridge to me are like a dream come true. Being a fan of creed(and I still am), back in 2000 when brian marshall left the band and left creed a bassless band and stapp's (good luck to him) typical frontman ego started to overshadow the musical growth of mark and flip. I was always supportive but since creed lost brian marhsall (he contributed huge to creed's sound that lacked horrible on weathered, and one of my favorite bassisits) and the overwhealmingly bad publicity and dissrecpect unfortunately 86ed their career. Sure, I'll still nostalgically put in the three creed albums and think what could of been, but it's all unfortunately water under the (alter) bridge. <br /> <br />Alter bridge's wind-up debute is a solid eleven song album of very very impressive riff's and screaming solos from mark tremonti. Over the last three years, his skills have improved to the point where he is destined to be like a modern day jimmy page or something of that magnatude. I always knew he was a very good guitarist from zach wyldish riffs of \\"find the real\\" to the melodic beauti of \\"broken wings\\". The vocals from myles kennedy are very impressive, like chris cornell fused with brandon boyd. He definetly going to stick out as on the othe better singers today with killer vocals on \\"burn it down\\" and \\"down to my last\\". Flip, well....I always thought he was just your average, everyday rock drummer. But, well....my view changed when he showed kick ass double bass on \\"metalingus\\" and interesting intervals on \\"the end is here\\".  The return of brian marshall really puts things onto a bass percpective, unfortunately I was a little dissapointed because his lines which were so vibrant in creed were almost unhearable on one day remains. I think it could either be because of ben grosse or pershaps because this is basically tremonti's band, to convey tremonti, myles and flip on vocals, guitar and drums. But,I found the more you listen with bass boost on you can hear more and more of his lines.Again, brian even said that they wanted to give one day remains a more \\"spongey bottom\\" and I think the low-end of his new 5-string may explain somewhat. However you do hear him pretty good in \\"shed my skin\\" and \\"open your eyes\\".  <br /> <br />I definetly recomend one day remains for any fan of hard rock, creed fan or not. And of course, there are going to be people who are going to expect creed II, and one day remains with the exception of maybe a few tunes is far from that. Also, there are going to be people who are going to blatantly trash this CD because mark, flip and brian had stapp as a singer once and to the still hostile grunge/pearl jam fanantics will nitpick at any and all faults they can find.  <br /> <br />
B0002DB52M|4.0|`Dogville', a three-hour filmed stage play by writer and director Lars von Trier is not for everyone, and that, dear reader, is an understatement. The A-List cast headed by Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, James Caan, Ben Gazzara, and John Hurt and the synopsis of the plot may give one the impression that this is a sleeper thriller waiting to be discovered.<br /><br />For starters, all the business takes place on a rather large stage, measuring perhaps 40 by 60 yards, probably the floor of a large sound stage. The stage setting owes much to the technique used in Thornton Wilder's classic play `Our Town' as it was originally produced on Broadway, not in the much more conventional setting we see in the movie made of the play. But, this production takes this basic notion much further. There are practically no flats depicting walls. All walls of all buildings in `Dogville' are marked by chalk marks on the floor of the stage, easily seen when the entire stage is photographed from a ceiling camera placed about 60 feet above the level of the floor. Almost all other features of buildings and fixtures are also represented by the same kind of chalkmarks. The only props are benches, chairs, beds, bookcases, and figurines actually used by the actors. Some very few key items such as the top of the steeple on the meetinghouse are present, hanging in midair to serve as a sign that this is the meetinghouse. Even the berry bushes often discussed and the dog after which one senses the town was named are represented by chalk outlines on the floor. An abandoned mine is represented by nothing more than a series of three or four timber reinforcement post and lentil sets lined up to outline the passage of the tunnel entrance. And this is just the beginning of the strangeness.<br /><br />The parallel with `Our Town' continues with the presence of a narrator of whom we only hear his voice. Unlike `Our Town', he does not appear `in the flesh' as a stage manager or any other character. The town, `Dogville' is an old mining town very much off the beaten track and on its last leg in the journey to ghost town status. Just a little more weird atmosphere to the setting, there is a constant thud of piledrivers heard in the distance where a construction crew is placing piles to anchor a new prison in a nearby marsh.<br /><br />The most prominent citizen of this small town is the local doctor Thomas Edison Sr., with no apparent connection except by name to the famous inventor. The main character among the residents of the town is his son, Thomas Edison Jr., played by Paul Bettany, whose proclaimed vocation is `writer'; however, he spends practically no time writing, claiming that he is gathering material from interaction with his neighbors.<br /><br />The story opens as Tom Jr. hears some gunshots over the sound of the piledrivers and runs into a young woman played by Nicole Kidman who is apparently fleeing from something, probably something connected with the gunshots. Soon afterward, a very fancy 1930's automobile shows up decked out with all the trappings of an Al Capone era mob bosses limousine. The driver asks Tom Jr. if he has seen a young girl, who he has just hidden in the old mineshaft. He claims ignorance of the girl and is given a business card by a shadowy hand attached to the occupant of the rear seat in the car with a voice which sounds like it comes straight from `The Godfather'. Since the actor providing the voice is James Caan, the voice did come straight from `The Godfather'.<br /><br />Much of the movie from that point on deals with the townsfolk's' agreeing to hide Kidman beginning with a two week trial period. In payment, Kidman's character attempts to do work for the town's few residents. At first they find nothing for her to do, but Edison Jr. points out things at which she can help. Once the movie settles down to accommodate the new girl in town, the dialogue and voice-over commentary begins going into very seriously impressionistic observations on town, life, and events. This is dialogue and narrative one may expect from Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter, Berthold Brecht or Henrik Ibsen. These are not sentences you will find in a script by Blake Edwards or even by Woody Alan or Robert Altman. Oddly, the ending is a big surprise and could have been conceived and written by Quentin Tarantino or Sam Peckinpah.<br /><br />As the ending and the way in which the story gets there is quite a surprise, I am reluctant to tell much more of the story. I will only repeat my warning that if you slip this DVD into you player, be prepared for a very weird, very cerebral ride with a stark surprise. I will only say that the ending is a serious homage to Kurt Weill's very popular song `Pirate Jenny'.<br /><br />My four star rating is less a reflection of the quality of the production than it is a warning to check your expectations at the door when you enter this party. All performances are delightful, especially from the rarely seen Ben Gazarra and the luminously legendary Lauren BaCall. Cinematography is rudimentary, but it doesn't have to be great on this kind of set. Lighting is just as quirky as the stagesettings. Blocking shots does seem a bit awkward at times, but it does not distract from the very strange things coming out of the actors' mouths.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, the dog does actually make an appearance in the final scene. And, I agree with another reviewer that this movie is not anti-American. I was not aware of the charge, but the thought never entered my mind as I was watching the movie.impressionistic observations on town, life, and events.

B000089RVR|5.0|This album is excellent, it reaches the standard of No Angel and possibly surpasses it. The lyrics are deep, the melodies are beautiful and the songs overall are well produced and catchy. There are a few duff ones in the middle (Do You Have A Little Time) but the rest are great. <br /> <br />One thing that annoys me though is the way people misinterpret the lyrics. See You When You're 40 is no love song, its a song about being angry at someone, an unidentified someone (now I've seen tonight, how could I waste my time and I'll be on my way and I won't be back). Also, Don't Leave Home is no love song either, its a song about addiction!!(When I've been here for just one day,You'll already miss me if I go away,  <br />So close the blinds and shut the door,You won't need other friends anymore.) <br /> <br />Anyway, the album is great, she writes amazingly and that's that.
B0002S94BG|5.0|How tragic it is that the brightest star always burns out the quickest.  It was indeed a sad day when the world lost Jeff Buckley.  He certainly could have been the next Bob Dylan.  His only proper studio release gets a major overhaul by the brilliant Sony/Legacy label.  This thing is absolutely the most beautiful album ever recorded.  I won't comment on the original album except for the fact that the remastering sounds amazing...and well, you should already own the original anyway! <br />The brand new second disc rewards the faithful with some trully stunning previously unreleased tracks.  \\"Forget Her\\" is reason enough to get this re-issue.  The other covers could have easilly fit onto the original release.  The DVD is top notch as well.  The \\"Grace\\" documentary is sweet sorrow...beautifully put together and thorough.  Lots of insightful interwiews with the band members. Eclectic, breathtaking and simply gorgeous! I only have two gripes: Where are the lyrics in the new booklet? Where are the acoustic versions of \\"So Real\\" and \\"Last Goodbye\\"?

B0002I831S|1.0|I am glad I was smart enough not to throw away my money like the people that paid $20.00 for only two episodes on prior DVDs. <br /> <br />But I have to say I sure feel sorry for those people.  So sorry that I will be laughing all the way to the bank with the money I saved for waiting! <br /> <br />Seriously...this situation is TERRIBLE for the Star Trek fans that got ripped off.  We feel your pain.
B000002X4T|4.0|One of the most anthemic of rock and roll bands, this album features two of the Airplane's best anthems ('We Should Be Together' and 'Volunteers of America') as well as several cuts of unmatched musical beauty and spiritual harmony. And a Russian Army song. Still has a place of honor on my turntable, after all these years.
B000174LVQ|5.0|There are moments of sheer Music which have the ability<br />to bring a smile to your heart, and thankful tears to<br />many an eye. Paco de Lucia, in the time in which he has<br />graced the world with the wizardry of his art, has<br />been responsible for many such moments.<br />\\"Aires de Linares\\", \\"Percussion Flamenca\\", \\"Almoraima\\",<br />\\"Montesario de Sal\\", his stirring sextet take on \\"El Vito\\",<br />his deadly arrangements of Manuel de Falla, his<br />breathtaking embrace of CONCIERTO DE ARANJUEZ are<br />but a few of the precious moments by which de Lucia<br />has inspired the audiences of the world for over<br />30 years.<br /><br />Truth to tell, after the captivating triumph of de Lucia's recording<br />from a few years ago, the incomparable LUZIA, many<br />wondered if, even for this master of the Flamenco guitar,<br />there were any more summits left.<br /><br />COSITAS BUENAS answers that question with a<br />resounding  affirmation of the man, his artistry,<br />and the Music which empowers all. If LUZIA was<br />the sunrise sweeping the waiting horizon, COSITAS<br />BUENAS is the becknoing twilight full of<br />playful allure, and spirits of renewal.<br /><br />A masterpiece of both traditional sound and<br />transitional vision, de Lucia unleashes a beautiful<br />flurry of cabaret sorcery worthy of the immortal<br />Sabicas himself. Voices and instrumentalists join<br />for devout song meant only for the most intimate<br />celebration, and dedicated participation.<br /><br />The air is charged with the weavings of Bulerias, Tientos,<br />Tango and Rumba, with a touch of Solea for special measure.<br />We are blessed by de Lucia's earthy song and gossamer chant,<br />its rolling dance and uplifting romance as sobering in scope<br />and focus as it is exhilirating to experience, and to share.<br /><br />COSITAS BUENAS. Paco de Lucia and friends, after hours,<br />brewing good little things which potently deliver The<br />Big Picture.<br /><br />Only one thing is needed to fulfill this summoning.<br />You. Enter cleanly, and know your own will.<br /><br />Come.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was anxious to see how Vol 2 ended the story of the bride.  Although Vol 1 was a bit ultraviolent, what really set it apart was the original characters.  Vol 2 has some interesting plot twists, but it does not captivate like Vol 1. <br /> <br />Be sure to catch Robert Rodriguez, director of the El Mariachi Trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon A Time In Mexico), and his bend \\"Chingon\\" in the special features.  They contributed much of the soundtrack to Kill Bill.  There's a live two song set of the band performing songs combining \\"Chingon-ized\\" versions of traditional Mexican mariachi songs.  Great stuff.  You can buy the CD on Amazon too (search for B00016XNAW).
B0001UL7RY|5.0|but wow this cd was really worth every penny. She is mutli-taleted singing, writing music, playing the guitar and playing the piano. she's a very talented woman...strong voice EVEN when she's singing live. get this cd...all music lovers need this cd in their collection. artists like ger really makes you apreciate music.
B00003CWOL|4.0|Is this the best quality film I have ever seen?  No, it is not.  However, it is a creative look at a serious topic and I think it is worth seeing.  And the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  The first time I saw the movie I was intrigued and it has continued to grow on me.  The quality of the cast makes some of the cornier lines work a little better.  I would recommend this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was 1st introduced to this CD because my choir performed the AMAZING song \\"Defying Gravity\\". So I went out and bought the CD not only to practice, but to listen through it because I love hearing new materials and broadways. I was instantly hooked! Idina's amazing voice (The Wizard and I) (Defying Gravity), Kristen's poppy personality (Popular) (Thank Goodness), and their unbelievable way to work off eachother in duets (For Good) (Loathing). So when i went to New York on vacation with my choir I had to go see it! AND I WAS IN AWW! This is a must have! I've owned the CD for months and I STILL listen through it!
B000005IU2|5.0|Ohhhh man. The debut was bloody briliant, but nothing could quite prepare America for \\"Fun House\\". This is, in my opinion, The Stooges' best album. It's full of lyrics about violence, sex, and just thrashing around. None of the wimpy \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" / Crosby Stills Nash crap that was popular at the time (I listen to CSN sometimes, only for the great Neil Young though). It is impossible to sit still while listening to this album. While poor recording quality sometimes mars other albums, it makes this one ever better. This truly sounds like it was recorded in hell. And by the way, I think Ozzy was listening to this album when he wrote the song \\"Crazy Train\\". <br /> <br />1) Down on the Street - Great way to open the classic. 5/5 <br />2) Loose - As good as \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" was, this song's sexuality just blows it away. 5/5 <br />3) TV Eye - Another great angst anthem, the above description fits this one perfectly also. 5/5 <br />4) Dirt - A more slow song, but that doesn't make it any worse. Really bluesy. 5/5 <br />5) 1970 - Perfect moshing tune. 5/5 <br />6) Fun House - The title track. Another brewing pot of briliance. 5/5 <br />7) L.A. Blues - This track is absolutely insane! It sounds like what I imagine Hell to sound like. Just pure chaos! <br /> <br />Well, buy it! No true fan of rock 'n' roll can be without this one. Also check out MC5's \\"Kick Out the Jams\\", Rolling Stones' \\"Exile On Main Street\\", and \\"Rumble: The Best of Link Wray\\" for pure unadulterrated rock 'n' roll.
1884822312|5.0|First let me say that a book on basic chessmates needs to be in the hands of every beginning chessplayer.  Even better advice is a superior book such as Polgar's 5334 chess problems!!!   <br /> <br />What's great about this book is that it is for pure beginners who need checkmate visualization training and for advanced players who need a refresher course.  Some intermediate players who need tactical and checkmating practice may object that the one-move checkmating puzzles in this book are so trivial that they are a waste of time.  However, the point of the exercises in the book is to increase pattern recognition so that you can see checkmates very quickly with minimal calculation. If you can solve the 3 move checkmates quickly by pure recognition then guess what, you can solve four, five, six on up move combinations that may require extensive calculation.   <br /> <br />Another objection to this book is that some the positions would never occur in a real game; some of the positions have pieces all over the place with the running king stuck in the middle of the board and you have to check mate him.  The point of these excercises is to increase skill in piece co-ordination and also how to perform a \\"mating net.\\"  I know countless time I've had an opponets king on the run and couldn't checkmate because I didn't know how to do a mating net. This book is well work the price!!!
0385336810|5.0|I found this book to be really funny, and the plot was well-developed. The story actually reminded me of Bridget Jones Diary, with events that just make you want to cringe..
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I have placed this film as one of my favorite films of all time because it works on so many levels. This film is visually stunning, musically magical, written beautifully and is most importantly a powerful message about how life was during the 1864 battle of Petersburg, Virginia. <br /> <br />The cast in this movie is fantastic, not one of the actors fails in their role and combined these brilliant actors weave together a phenomenal tale of the harshness of life on \\"Cold Mountain.\\" Nicole Kidman is a beautiful, educated city girl who has moved to the country with her pastor father, played by Donald Sutherland. Kidman represents purity and the ultimate in feminine weakness as expected during the 1800's, she can look fresh and pretty, play beautiful music, read and speak French but she was never taught anything else. As the movie advances Kidman adapts to her changing role and is absolutely convincing in her strength as a woman during a time when the least was expected of one. Kidman falls for a character played by Jude Law and a great love story unfolds in the midst of war. Jude Law's character plays at war but never becomes convinced of its value towards humanity so he pays a very high price. Although the love story in this film is touching and emotionally significant I found it paled in comparison to the heroic efforts found in the side story. <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger is a central character to this film and pulls off an excellent performance as the tough and robust country woman who saves Kidman's farm. Zellweger transforms herself into a woman who verges on manhood, gritty and absolutely unfeminine for the time period, but she is the perfect savior next to Kidman and with her role makes a great statement about the worthiness of women during the era. Many other actors make brief but powerful appearances starting with Eileen Atkins, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, and others. Each supporting character strengthens the story and is foundto have a reason for being cast in the film rather than just appearing at random.  <br /> <br />This film is directed by Anthony Minghella and he has done an excellent job bringing to life the harshness of life during the war of 1864 in Virginia, he captures the beauty that surrounds all of the hate and shows how nature has its own hand at what unfolds. Minghella brings forth the message that women were nothing without men to support them but that the strong ones managed to survive when they were willing to take on the additional burdens of \\"manhood\\" while their men were being killed at war. The hatred and prejudice of the time is handled with intense scenes of slaves being killed, families being tortured and with realistically impressive war depictions. Minghella creates paintings with almost every shot. So often epic sagas such as this one fail because the expectations run high but I could find nothing in this film that failed, it is simply amazing.    <br />
B0002KVUKM|5.0|AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME <br />GREAT BODY, GREAT ACTING, GREAT EVERYTHING!!!! <br />now, lets see HIM in more GREAT romantic COMEDIES!!!
B00003CWPR|4.0|Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviewers to expect.  It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme.  Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology.  The theme can be stated simply: \\"marriage is a fortress continually under siege.\\"  To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally were actually married to one another at the time, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme.  We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might have been like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.  Indeed with their subsequent separation, Kubrick's theme is ironically supported.<br /><br />Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice.  They go to a party and act out some \\"teasing themselves\\" roles, as they have undoubtedly done before.  Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people.  But the next night Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform.  Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place.  As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc.  What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him.<br /><br />This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons.  One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple.  Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some.  Three, many young couples viewing the film together, or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations.  To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for.  Most people lie to themselves about their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time.  Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are.  Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it.  Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now?  And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out): Be grateful that one day does not make an entire lifetime.<br /><br />What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm.  Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want.  Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature.  Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.<br /><br />Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent.  As always she becomes the character she is playing.  Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing.  The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class.  The sometimes annoying score is appropriate.  But this is not a great movie.  Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times.  I would rank it just below the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.<br /><br />See this for Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's most accomplished and respected artists.  It was his last completed film before he died.  Would that we had another like him.ntain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away. <br /> <br />Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent.

B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This is a well polished \\"who dun it\\" movie.  The acting is decent, and the mood is consistent.  The problem I have is the fact that this movie brings absolutly nothing to the table.  There is nothing that is exciting and new when you watch this movie.  It is just another murder mystery kind of experience.  Also, it is very easy to predict the ending.  There is nothing mind blowing about this movie.  I would suggest this one as a rental because it does have a few aspects that make it enjoyable to watch.  If you are looking for something truly great, you might skip this one.
068484267X|5.0|I first read this book when it first came out. Since then, I have read it like five times. The first time I read it, it left a lasting impression on my mind that has not left since then and it still does it for me. I found his life fascinating. The fact that he had such a complicated childhood and still managed to find so much humor in all of it, is somewhat bizarre, but human. I did not know if I was supposed to laugh or to cry at certain times, but what captivated me the most was his sincerity. A sincerity that I had not found in a book since J.D. Salinger. Completely different authors, but both very honest about life. I wish everyone in the world would get a chance to read this book, it is truly special.
