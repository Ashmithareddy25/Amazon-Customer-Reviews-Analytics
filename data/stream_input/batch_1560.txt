B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This product is amazing, I am Turkish, I got this product for my nephews who are living in Turkey and can only speak Turkish. My aim was to make them hear English, for the first time they watched it in English and then, it started to play in Turkish without changing any set-ups. It was interesting, then, they liked it more.
0771079672|1.0|I am relieved to know that Israel is doing so brilliantly well because of their 'culture'. Clearly we can now stop sending billions of dollars in American taxpayer money to Israel. Israel will also be able to give the Occupied Territories back to the Palestinians and revert to the country's correct borders. After all, no need to steal olive groves when you have great start-ups generating wealth. Perhaps the anti-African immigrant demos can also stop with full employment.<br /><br />Also, I'm happy to know that that rip-off company that pounds mall-goers to buy massively marked-up cosmetics 'from Israel' is a product of a terrific culture. That makes me feel better about the constant harassment.<br /><br />I will look forward to announcements of the cessation of US aid. This author has done a great job of convincing me that it's no longer necessary.
B002N7P23I|5.0|[Rec] is a thrilling horror film about a small camera crew documenting the lives of firemen. They end up quarantined in an apartment building when an unknown disease is traced back to that location. The reason you should watch the original Spanish version is because the cast did a great job and you can often hear the fear and panic in their voices; something I don't believe can be easily and effectively captured by a voiceover.  Manuela Velasco as Ángela was standout in this film and so was the police officer. The movie has a great introduction, and the thrills start after about 15 minutes with a few breaks throughout the rest of the runtime. I also liked the ending.<br /><br />This is an amazing horror film, packed with thrills and frights up to the creepy ending. I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />[Rec] has strong violence and blood. No sex/nudity.
B004LKVHSY|5.0|This is a touching movie that looks at real life issues.  The movie is not for kids but is very entertaining.  The acting is great.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|21 Jump Street was a lot better than I expected. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry and are very funny throughout; honestly, Channing Tatum was the most surprising and it was the little things he said that got me, like the Frisbee scenes and Bakugan lines. Jonah Hill also had a couple of funny scenes. The acting was fine and it has a surprising twist towards the end for fans of the original 21 Jump Street.<br /><br />But, I thought it moved to fast in the beginning, causing it to lose some of its steam towards the end. By the 15 minute mark, they were already going undercover, which leaves only 15 minutes to show the high school scenes and police academy scenes.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth the 99¢ rental and I am even considering a purchase in the near future. It is a great comedy film to kill time.<br /><br />21 Jump Street has violence and blood, drug use, strong language and sex/nudity.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its a good passtime i have mastered a puzzle in a hour not because it was easy because i couldnt put it down
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app very much, very handy. Hasn't been wrong yet. Cool, amazing, blah blab blab blah! clays han haa
B007SYWFRM|4.0|yes, as the other reviewers stated this game can be a bit glitchy. I got the worm animal... the whole family but it doesn't appear. Same for the horse. I wish the better stuff didn't cost acorns but that seems to be the deal with all of these type of games. STILL ... you can get free acorns in a number of ways and the game is fun and it iskind of addicting. I'm not a kid and I keep coming back. Zoology 4 outs 5 stars. glitchy but fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am having a lot of fun with this app.  It starts out easy and gets more challenging as you progress.  I do not generally like this sort of game or puzzle but this is very good.  You can also go back and redo puzzles.
1601251505|1.0|All the same flaws of 3.5 in a shiny new package. I really don't get spending money on a copy and paste job with a few minor changes here and there.
0439680093|1.0|This is a poorly written book with content that nobody, nevermind children should read or enjoy.  I found my ten year old reading this repulsive book - he'd gotten it at  the library.  In the first section of the book - a teenage kid stabs a security guard to death.  Further on, the hero douses two guard dogs with gasoline and lights them on fire.  Its too late, my son already read this C*ap, now he's got that image in his mind.<br /><br />Its my considered opinion that no kids - young adults especially should be exposed to this junk.  Considering all the fantastic stuff they could be reading, it makes me sick that this guy has any commercial success.  As a society, we wonder how our kids get exposed to these ideas of violence - its pretty sad that a publisher like Penguin would allow this kind of thing to be peddled to children.<br /><br />Horowitz is a sort of child predator  - preying on kids to get money selling them books he could never sell to adults.  He's an unquestionably bad writer, who could never make it writing books for adults (or at least I hope not).<br /><br />We had also allowed our son to get the \\"Alex Rider\\" books through the school book ordering program - I'm kicking myself for that.  I've always been against book burning, now I find have something in common with evangelical wackos, because all these books are good for are kindling.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is a nice distraction.  I am only up to 7x7 so i hope it continues to be more and more challenging.
030758836X|1.0|A strong beginning written in a clever, quickly-paced style soon deteriorates into pop fiction mediocrity. Implausible events/situations, new character traits popping up like rabbits out of hats, women with supercharged libidos all test the reader's willingness to suspend disbelief.  This book was written for Hollywood.  It will succeed in that, but it failed with me.  I set it aside about page 130 when Andie the \\"mistress\\" makes her surprise appearance pulling her dress off and cooing for sex. Both her sudden arrival in the narrative and the manner in which she makes it provoked one last \\"Get Real!\\" reaction. Gillian Flynn has writerly chops, but in this book she uses them to exploit our culture rather than contribute to it.
B005FISC52|5.0|I was very satified with this DVD set. It was a great season to end an amazing series! It was great season if you love One Tree Hill, you will love this one season! It was great to wrap season 1 things in to this season! :)I have been a recent die hard fan of One Tree Hill, I started watching it on SoapNet a couple months ago and now I am hooked!I kinda wish they had a season 10 but Season 9 was a great season to end it! :)
0345803485|1.0|Ok, tell the truth the author is really 16 and just learned about a \\"naughty\\" subject... I couldn't even get through half before giving up. The writing is what I would expect from a first draft of a teenage writer. The amount of suspension of disbelief needed to overlook all the plot and character flaws is more than I have. Sad to think so many actually think this is a good book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the different games offered. There is something for everyone. I love the variety they provide! Very fun and addicting!
B004J88SGC|5.0|a must have for billy joel fans, the man has a stage show that can not be beat! no matter what arena,he puts on a great show!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love how it has so many different games to chose from...keeps it entertaining and interesting so that  I'm never bored
B0034KZE9U|5.0|As a Barista, who works on a wet floor and is constantly mopping up floors and going up and down flights of stairs, this shoe has been a god-sent. The shoe is designed to not weigh too much and give your toes ample room to spread and not in a fixed position! You learn to splay your toes wearing these shoes and can remain grounded during long shifts on your feet. I usually hose the outside of the shoe to remove any dirt within seconds and they look good as new aside from regular creasing through use. As far as aesthetics go, the shoes are appear wider in person and may not be the most attractive slip resistant shoe but one of the best.
B005K17RU0|3.0|this app is ok because the current weather feature is not always accurate.  I mean it could be storming for over an hour and its says sunny. the saving feature is the current radar map and 14 day future weather cast. it has potential to be a great app. just needs to be adjusted. this is of course my humble opinion.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I hadn't given Foo Fighters much of a chance before listening to Wasting Light. I had always heard songs from them I liked, but none that jumped out at me and say WHOA...I gotta get that album! Well, when I heard \\"These Days\\" and \\"Walk\\" I said and did exactly that. I have not been disappointed. Amazing album from an amazing band. Songs are written with precision and played and sung with so much passion that it makes you feel the emotions Dave was feeling at the time of writing. I absolutely love this album and recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying it. Every song is good. There is not one song I skip when playing in my car. Don't hesitate to pull the trigger.<br /><br />TLDR; This album did not come out of the CD player in my car for 4 months!
B008C20TDG|5.0|If you have read the Paleo Solution, you know about 95% of what is in this book. With that said, I still think that this book is an invaluable read.<br /><br />I plan on updating this review at a later time. Until then, read this book!
0688170528|5.0|A touching story of two next door childhood friends who became teenagers in love.  When Emily becomes pregnant with Chris's child their perfect lives turn into desperation and tragedy for themselves and their families.  Wonderfully written book that I couldn't put down.  One of my favorite books written by Jodi Picoult.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Can't reply to messages sometimes....annoying! This app may be free but not worth downloading and taking up space...in my opinion anyway. I go through the regular browser.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a very cool app. Lots of options for creating many<br />alarms and types of alarms. This app should come as part of Android<br />so we don't have to install it on top of the stock OS of the phone.<br />If you use/need alarms on your cell phone, get this.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I bought these when they first came out - then sold them! Aside from the scene changes and whole rearrangement of the films, the Blu-Ray quality was not up to par for me!  I did not expect them to be consistent given then different times and mediums used, but I expected each on to look it's best on Blu-Ray!  I think what Lucas attempted to do was to make them all look the same presentation wise.  This was a mistake as it took away from each film the look that they had individually.  I also did not like the fact that The Phantom Menace was softened to make it look digital.  Yeah, it was always the nosiest of the films, but it lacked detail and that film-like look that it had.<br /><br />Now I can say that I did not mind the special editions in the 90's as the original films were getting dated and were no longer looking state of the art.  Blame Terminator 2 for that one!  I understood why Lucas has to make those more up to date, but when you tinker with things once and like it, then you tinker with more stuff and then it becomes something else.  People may not like people who complain about the changes made to the films, but these were not the film we saw in the theaters in the 70's, 80's, 90's or 2000's!  These were films that none of us saw making their debut on Blu-Ray! We did not ask for this but this is what was given to us.  DO I want to see the originals unedited and uncut on BD only?  Probably not because they will look like 70's and early 80's films now, but I would not mind it if it were in a box set.<br /><br />On a side note, the prequels were not bad, but aside from some lag in the love story and the kind of terrestrial look of Attack of the Clones, I think the main thing that makes the prequels hard to digest is ONE PRIMARY thing that I have not heard anyone touch one - everyone does a flip before they begin to fight with light-sabers!  These things alone make the films looks silly.  In none of the originals did anyone do a flip right before the fight.Those looked more realistic and they looked more like a fight for their lives.  In the prequels it looked more like a show thing for a young audience and another thing that Lucas thought would be \\"cool.\\"  I swear, aside from Jar-Jar, if they took those initial flips out of the light-saber battles, the films quality from that alone would increase.  Also, Obi Wan getting smacked around by a 2 ton steel cyborg and not having his head come off was not good either.  They should have made it so that he avoided getting hit since he knew it would kill him.  Aside from the fact that he was not unconscious (compared to being slammed against a railing by Dooku AND keeping his legs!), he did not bleed or have broken bones.  You know he should have died after one blow however!<br /><br />CHange these things I pointed out, add the originals in a deluxe box set, improve the picture quality and they may have a good one.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a really cool App. It is very versatile and lets you play<br />your own creations, save them or just play automatically.<br /> Nice volume to it too.
0345803485|5.0|I have the 50 Shades trilogy twice and will read them again.  This is more than just erotic porn that some people are calling these books.  I didn't judge the writing because I was so glued to the book, I didn't pay any attention or even notice.  This is a sweet love story.  If you actually read the books you will see there are great lessons taught, caring, consideration, patience, understanding, acceptance and more.  Don't get me wrong, it is still very hot!  But there is just something about the books.  Don't put them down just because it might get a little steamy, keep reading!  I loved them and will read them for a 3rd time...soon.  The characters of Christian and Anna just draw you in to the book.  You know very soon that it is fiction and in the real world, the people just don't exist but that is why I read, to just escape reality sometimes and get lost in a book!  And believe me, you can get lost in these!  Can't wait to see if E.L James writes another trilogy from Christian's point of view!  But I will tell you, unless you have a reader, don't start the 1st book with having purchased all 3!  You will be trying to find an all night bookstore!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is lovable and adicting!  I lice it so much and its an amazing time killer!  I play it all day and it can get really tricky at times!  I give this game a 5 - stars :)
B008QE9XD2|1.0|As a fan of the original series (and I even liked the 90's version too) I have to say that watching Tim Burton's reimagining of Dark Shadows was a painful experience.  A great cast was completely wasted in this wretched movie.  I had high hopes as the film began with Depp's voice over relating the Collins family history and his tragic transformation into a creature of the night. Almost every scene thereafter is an affront to those who cherish the original series (and yes I did read that Burton said his version was not intended for old fans,but come on!). I can't really fault the actors. I think they did as best they could with the script (which seems as if it was written by two drunk teenagers during a farting contest) and the direction (does<br />Burton even CARE anymore???) they had to deal with. Burton has made some great films in the past but this is definitely NOT one of them. Old fans should stay away. Those who didn't know what to expect but did like this remake ought to check out the real deal and decide for themselves. Hopefully there will be no sequel to this mess and maybe 10 to 20 years from now someone with respect for the series will do a reduxe worthy of our time and money (calling Chrisopher Nolan)
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it was super addicting at first until it got so difficult I couldn't figure it out! I recommend it for people who like a challenging puzzle
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy to play for all ages. It is hard to get acorns. I like playing for free. I have bought a few acorns. As you move up in levels, buying more space gets expensive using your game coins. But if play every day you get a lot of points (coins). Not a bad game at all. Enjoy......
B0086700CM|3.0|in temple run you are always determined to beat your highest score. its frustrating and super fun. be sure to have ALOT of free time before you play;)
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I love this app..I find it waaay easier to control the bike than the first trial xtreme. and it doesn't have tilt controls which I'm happy about cuz I hate the tilt controls cuz they're waaaaaay too hard..love this game.
B0086700CM|4.0|decent graphics and good plot good extras like invisibility and power run.  I can never get past a few kilometers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For two weeks the Greys were my reading life. I enjoyed the books so much that television was put on the back burner. I knew that I would be sad when the series ended. Christian Grey as faulted as he was, was the most romantic man I have ever read. I must admit that the sex took me awhile to get used to but ultimately the story took over. I have recomended this to all my friends but you have to know who will be offended by the sex.
B0034G4P26|5.0|My husband, my 2 year old daughter, and I went to see this movie at the drive in near us on Memorial weekend.  My daughter has NEVER sat through an entire movie, but she was comepletely enthralled by The Pirates!  My husband and I loved the humor and the movie was just beautifully done.  I will definitely be purchasing this movie and hope that there are sequels made - we would go see every one!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a grate game for kids. my little sister love this game she said that this game is the best hams in the world.My little sister is 5.
0345803493|5.0|I got a lady friend the first book in this trilogy and she was hooked. Well, so have millions of other readers too. So this is the second book which she has not begun yet as she is still poring over book one. Picking up tips, perhaps?? Very fast delivery, well within the forecast delivery date. Thank you.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read. I suggest this read to anyone. It was hot and steamy but also had a great story line to it too.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|I can say nothing about the content because I was only able to view the first eight minutes before it froze.  I tried skipping scenes but each one had a spot where the film froze.  The Sony blu-ray machine is brand new and another film I got at the same time worked fine.  I'll try the plain ole DVD version - that's what I recommend you do as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a lot of fun just to try and beat yourself on anything from distance to points and stay alive as long as possible
0345803485|1.0|Pathetic writing skill.  I am tri-lingual, and realized anyone can NOW be a writer.  All you need is an idea.  Sex sells.  The story in the book is very un-real.  This book is insulting to all women.  Book is selling due to outstanding marketing.  Readers with intelligence should be able to distinguish outstanding literature.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Nice to be able to see exactly how much time &amp; energy<br />is left. Nice to be able to change color to make it look<br />like whatever fuel you prefer.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I became emotionally involved with this book (and the Barber family) which made it a bit difficult to read. As the mother of a son myself, I could totally relate to what Laurie was going through and could almost feel her pain. I know from experience that teenage boys can be difficult to communicate with because they so often keep their problems inside. I had to remind myself that it was \\"just a book\\" because I felt somewhat sad and depressed after getting attached to the family! A couple of surprising twists kept the book suspenseful and I read quickly to find out what was going to happen to the Barbers and (wow) what an ending!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I find some of the Reviews rather harsh. I think people do forget that this is after all just a Book, it is Fiction, and the last time I checked, Fiction has not too much to do with Reality. It's after all a Erotic Novel and not a Biography, so I guess its ok to stretch the possibility of all this happening in Real Life.<br /><br />After saying that, I think the Book is an easy and entertaining read. If you want some light, sappy, in some way erotic reading this will do the Job. If you expect a true-life story, its rather not.<br /><br />I, myself, am on the third Book now, and kind of lost Interest. The Book is rather predictable, but nothing wrong with that. I skimmed through the Main-Events of the Book, read the End and thats really all I wanted to know.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|If you think you have roots in knowing great rock music then it is certain you know of Rush and have owned some thing from Rush.  These masters of rock music will push your stereo system till it smokes and your amp catches fire.  It is a must for anybody who thinks their sound system can play the best recordings ever made.  Each new album gives joy and helps the audiophile addict to escape and love his or her listening environment.  Thank you for making it possible to kick back and find joy from your sounds and talented stories of harmony & language.  See what you think????
B0001AP12G|5.0|Great Debut Album for Kanye Wesst. Came in in like 3 days. I' listening to it as i write this review, I woulkd definately recommend this album to any hiphop or r & b fan.
B000QCSA54|5.0|FYI - I have the Kindle version. Great little book. I really appreciate Seth Godin's work. Very timely for me right now. Worth picking up, and better yet SHARING!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've owned this headset for over a year now, and it's still going strong. Still not wearing out or showing signs its about to break or otherwise fail or malfunction. I use this headset almost strictly for playing PC games and using programs like Ventrilo, Teamspeak, and Mumble, although I have done some Netflix viewing and it excels in providing quality audio in all of these.  Now, time for the lists:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Excellent audio quality, with software equalizer to tune to your tastes. (Note: Have not tested on music, I do -NOT- consider myself an \\"audiophile\\" or audio expert.)<br />- Build construction overall feels solid<br />- Comfortable even after long sessions (As a glasses-wearer, over the ear headsets often smash the ear pieces against my head making wearing them very uncomfortable, but not these!)<br />- Large adjusting size. I have a very large head, these still fit great.<br />- Durability. As previously mentioned, still going strong after a year.<br />- Volume adjustment and buttons on ear cup are very convenient.<br />- No batteries to change, and the USB charger has a built in USB port so you can plug the dongle into it while charging.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Mic boom feels a little flimsy.<br />- Wife gets mad when I can't hear her talking to me, because these block outside noises so well.<br />- I forget I'm searing them sometimes, and people look at me funny.<br />- Extra long USB charging cord get stuck under my chair wheel.<br /><br />Final words: This is a purchase I have not regretted, and you won't either. I was somewhat concerned with going to a USB wifi solution over a traditional sound card and wired headset, but I am extremely satisfied with the result.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I was looking high and low to find a DAC that would work with the LG 47LW6500 3D LED Television I got Christmas 2011 and my good old Sony 7-ES Analog Receiver that is still great into its second decade.  Amazon reviews made the decsion harder as this converter or that one was filled with warnings about HD signals, DACs breaking down after a short while.  So I finally decide to take the plunge after reading about other LG owners' success with this FiiO D3.  It arrives today in a wee-little box the belied its true sizable value. Hooked it up and voila!  TV sound reverberating once again thru my ceiling recessed speakers just in time for football season!  Hope and pray it stays that way!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I would love it if you update and get more levels because the levels are too short and simple, I still love this game, but I want more, please? please help me make this notice able.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Peter Gabriel has long been one of my favorite artists. The Secret World Live BD is excellent. I wish I could have seen it at the time but this is very close. It is well put together, has great sound and is a blast to watch. His songs still move me.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this disc if you are Peter Gabriel fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it...I really enjoyed all the fifty shades books and I highly recommend them to any woman who likes romance.
0143119680|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is a book about Diane a witch, who does not want to accept that she is a witch.  She knows that there are others out there that our like her and other creatures that are not like her, vampires and deamons. She has managed to stay in the \\"human\\" world until she is doing reseach for an Alchemy conference. While doing her research she pulls a maunscript that is more than meets the eye. By doing this she attracts the attention of Matthew Clairmont, a vampire that is interested in not only the book.<br /><br />For me this was a mix between Twilight and the DiVinci Code. The book is about a witch and a vampire working together to get to know more about this mysterious manuscript. There are parts in this book that I found were mundane and I would have liked more development with the other characters. One can definintly tell that this is a trilogy, but there is a lot of filler that does not need to be in this book. If a fourth of this book was cut out, I think that the book would have better flow.<br /><br />All in all I really like this book and will be reading the next book in this series. If you were enthralled by the Twilight series and inamorated with DiVinci Code I know you will love this book.
1567184855|5.0|In the beginning of this book it's very dry and sterile. This is because the author wants to make sure you understand that he was not a believer in anything before he stumbled across this. I read it twice as it's filled with so much \\"new\\" information to me that I gained an even greater insight the second time around. I've also read the follow up book Destiny of Souls. This book opened my eyes to a greater understanding and awareness of life and it's meanings. I was raised a staunch Southern Baptist and then when to Assembly of God churches. I saw a lot of hate and manipulation going on yet I knew I believed in God and Christ but did really see it in man made religions. I wondered where in the Bible God/Christ said to get Him the finest clothing available..He didn't yet so many of current pastors/ministers, priests etc etc use \\"church\\" money to buy them. NOT in the Bible. They drive around in high priced cars with private jets and limos. Christ didn't ride around in a fancy chariot or wear fancy clothes or shoes. He didn't have men carry him around in a chair on their shoulders like the Pope does. NONE of these people are of God/Christ. Since reading these books and getting a much greater understanding of God/Christ my life is now one of joy and wonder and I pray more now than I ever did and He does love all of us. I no longer attend four walled churches and do not \\"pray in public like the heathen do\\". My life is much richer now than it ever was and I'm not talking money wise.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As a professional Hypno-Therapist, I love this App. I have it on two Kindle Fires that I use in my reception room, and have clients listen to while waiting for their appointment time.<br /><br />I have only been using like this for a couple weeks and am blown away by the result. My client report that it helps them relax from the stresses of the day and and I have noticed that it seems to allows then to reach the desired level of relaxation during hypnosis much faster.<br /><br />I also have it on my personal Kindle Fire and my wife and I enjoy falling to sleep listening to a mix of frogs, crickets, and orchestral music.<br /><br />I have decided to purchase the upgrade for all three devices. Even if I don't use all the new features, I feel I owe the developers of this App something for what they have given to me and my clients.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|WOW! I had a hard time at first adjusting to the difference in 1800 language and todays, but man I am sure glad I stuck with it. What a wonderful book. No surprise that it is in the \\"classics\\" catagory. Beautifully written love, hate, passion, and lonely darkness novel. Think I will be reading it again.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good presentation, easy to play.  Sometimes cards are difficult to see, but still very nice! It's nice that the game allows reshuffling for when you get stuck!!
B007A4Y1Q8|5.0|1999 was one of the best years in american filmmaking: Fight Club, The Matrix, Magnolia, The Insider, and of course Being John Malkovich. The first time i saw this film, i didn't know what to expect, then i was surprised by how original and weird the movie was. And now that i had the chance to see it again, i realized it is one of those films that never gets old. Criterion does it again, and gives the film the treatment it deserves with stunning image and sound. I highly recommend to those who haven't seen it and those who already have.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a new twist on a classic game. with new levels. and new characters to choose from. I LOVE IT
0425263908|5.0|I bought this book after reading many reviews that compared it to 50 Shades. Never a romance novel enthusiast until after my recent introduction to the E.L. James trilogy, I was sad that I had nothing to move onto that was intense and thought provoking. I bought this book on a Tuesday afternoon and had it finished with 40hrs of having it in my possession. Loved it and recommend it to anyone looking for a naughty but extraordinary story of two people who have to fight their love. I think I might be a junky. Damn you modern day romance novels!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have one word for this book..AMAZING. In some parts it was like watching a train wreck.  just couldn't put it down. I know there are several bad reviews for this book but I think it is awesome. The characters are so well written and you feel like you are eavesdropping on their life. And girls, you have to admit, everyone has fallen in love with a bad boy at some point. That is what makes this book so appealing.<br /><br />Abby is one of the main characters in this book. She is the good girl running from a bad home to start life anew at a far away college. Travis is the all-american bad boy. He can have any girl he wants except for Abby;  who seems resistant to his charms. When she looses a bet to him, just how far will he go to keep her.<br /><br />Reading this book will sometimes make your head spin. It is full on all the time. There is so much information packed into it. Sometimes Travis doesn't always make the best decisions and saying he has a temper is quite an understatement. You have to admit though he does love her and love makes us do crazy things. Please read this, you won't be sorry.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Brisingr is a very good book that can be topped very rarely. The way Paolini writes makes me feel like im right beside Eragon killing Galbatorix's soldiers. I am anxiously waiting for Inheritence and I hope it's as good as the others. I spent many nights up late reading. All in all, it was the best.
0812993292|4.0|A man sets off walking across the length of England to see a friend who is dying of cancer, somehow believing that by so doing he can save her.  This journey ends up transforming both the man, and his relationship with his wife, as he reprocesses his memories and his history during the course of the long walk.  The book is divided into two unequal pieces.  The first two hundred and fifty pages describe the walk itself, the countryside, the people he encounters, and the doubts he experiences about the validity (or lack thereof) of the journey itself. The last fifty or so pages give the backstory to why his life and his relationships with his wife and son had been so fraught, the nature of his relationship with the woman suffering from cancer, and the challenges he faced.  In a way, there is a jarring change in tone between the two sections, but the author has a lot to say about human nature, hope, human suffering, the nature of aging, and relationships, and the journey is definitely worth the time, even with the sharp twists and turns at the end.

B004TI5N38|4.0|A family staying in a home in a small town is brutally, savagely and professionally murdered.  One of the victims is a military intelligence officer who worked close to extremely sensitive military secrets.  That is why a ranking military intelligence investigator is sent to the town to work with the local police. But why was he sent alone when the Army could provide such vast resources?  What else might be suspected, or feared?  As the story develops you will meet the military investigator who bears an eerie resemblance to another military investigator many readers will know well,- Jack Reacher of Lee Childs novels.  This is a different character but he is military, big, rough, direct, misses nothing, has a pile of high level experience, close combat techniques, weaponry, and criminal investigation.  (Sounds like Reacher to me.) The book takes a twisting trail through a number of suspects, events, and threats.  You'll enjoy it!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Never had a chance to watch this show until it was in the 5th season. I'm SO enjoying watching from the beginning. The acting is outstanding and the character development is intriguing. A completely accurate depiction of the era in social mores, politics and, of course, the fashion!<br />LOVE this show...well earned Emmys!<br />As for the Amazon shop who sold me my videos, my products were recieved in perfect condition in a very timely manner. First class all the way!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If Joss Whedon doesn't do \\"Avengers 2,\\" it will be so disappointing. This could NOT have been an easy movie to make and Whedon nails it. He's the first director to get the Hulk right. Unlike so mnay team-up movies, it never feels like any characters are being underserved or overserved, and it's just fun. Okay, so the Iron Man turbine scene was a little silly and went on for too long, but if that's the ONLY thing wrong with it, that's still an accomplishment. The best part? Thor should've been the character no one really cared about, so the plot revolved around him. Captain America should've come in second, so they made his character arc the most compelling and fraught. So, when it's Iron Man, Downey can just be Downey and the Hulk can be used just enough. I never liked Black Widow until this movie. Even Hawkeye, a throwaway, unnecessary addition on paper, works well here. And the real, REAL best part? Tom Hiddleston as Loki. A weaker villain and it would've fallen apart. A weaker actor as Bannner and it would've fallen apart. Whedon makes it look easy. Truly a movie for the ages.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I agree with a lot of the good and bad reviews... but I do have to say I know exactly why the author chose to write this way. Ana is a english lit student obsessed by 19th Century authors and her whole world is seen as English Romance... The book is written like a college student with an active imagination and low self-esteam. Regardless.. allow yourself to be Ana and you might actually enjoy this book.<br />This is the way an barely 21yr girl sees the world... If I were you I'd ask your college student daughters about their monolouges in their heads.

And then when I got the email saying that there's no tracking on this service from the reseller, I was even more scared that I might not get what I ordered.  But totally not true.  In the email, I got an estimate when my purchase will arrive \\"Thursday July 26 - Friday August 10\\"... And to my excitement I received it on Friday July 27!!  Yea the box was a bit indented here and there, but I didn't buy it for the box. I got it for the actual movies. And all the movies look good. Nothing looks bad or scratched or chipped or broken. The quality in the movies are Amazing (since it is in Blu-Ray). I am in total shock on how fast it actually came and for one of the most unbeatable/Amazing price out on the market.

B0031RSA24|4.0|In \\"The God Delusion\\", Richard Dawkins, a respected evolutionary biologist and science writer, takes a sideways step to write on the subject of religion. Of course, this isn't exactly a left-field topic for Dawkins: the encroachment of religion into science has long been a bugbear for him and others like him and he has never stinted to attack the pernicious attempts of religious apologists to claim some form of moral ascendancy in the field of biological origins. However, here he goes several stages further to shine a scientific light on the origins and arguments of religion itself, even considering it as worthy of an evolutionary treatment. Thus, the chapter titles give a strong flavour of how the book is written, so in Chapter 2; \\"The God Hypothesis\\" Dawkins examines the meaning of 'God' and 'religion'. Chapters 3 and 4: \\"Arguments for God's existence\\" and \\"Why there almost certainly is no God\\" consider the 'logical' postulates for a supernatural, personal deity and presents a number of scientific counter-arguments. Chapter 5: \\"The roots of religion\\" considers how religions may have originated and 6 and 7 \\"The roots of morality\\" and \\"The 'Good Book' and the changing moral Zeitgeist\\" ponders where our morality comes from (hint: NOT from the bible). Chapter 8 \\"What's wrong with religion\\" answers the question 'what's the harm?'<br /><br />This book has come in for a lot of criticism since it was published - understandable, I suppose, considering that it effectively takes a pop at the dearly held beliefs of a very large proportion of the human population of the entire planet. Had it's reception been muted, I am sure that Dawkins would have been deeply disappointed. Interestingly though, it seems to have been sniped at by quite a few non-religious readers. Both parties' criticisms are nicely dealt with in Dawkins' preface to this edition and it would be unreasonable to address them all. A popular complaint is that Dawkins' writing is 'shrill' or 'hectoring' which is both an excellent example of the ad hominem attack and also profoundly wrong. His tone is (for the most part) level, reasonable and measured.<br /><br />Another recurring complaint is that the book is \\"too long\\" or it is \\"badly in need of an editor\\" or similar. I find such detractions quite odd. The God Delusion is intended as a scientific treatment; therefore it is comprehensive, systematic and detailed. Perhaps Dawkins over-bakes his cake in places, but no scientific paper can justly be criticised for including too much detail. Repetition, perhaps, but even that's not a valid criticism of TGD. All that said, this is still not a particularly long book. If you want 'wordy', try reading anything by Stephen King for goondess' sake!<br /><br />A further argument is that Dawkins doesn't know his theology; that he errs on several key points of detail... as if this invalidates his core arguments! This is akin to 'The Courtier's Reply': Dawkins is in no position to observe that God is naked because he has failed to understand that having a long flowing beard renders him (God) at least partially clothed! What tosh! Did Lot really offer his daughters up for gang-rape? Does Dawkins really understand the technicalities of the transsubstantiation? Do martyrs receive 72 virgins on arrival at the pearly gates or 72 raisins? Is the rape of vulnerable children by Catholic priests caused or just enabled by their religious organisation? Who (in their right mind) cares? How do such fiddling obfuscations have any bearing on the existence (or non-existence) of God? on the origins of religion and whether or not it's a good thing?<br /><br />Criticisms aside, TGD is a nicely written, carefully constructed argument; persuasively passionate and yet also dispassionate. I am, and always have been, an atheist, so TGD is very much preaching to this member of the choir (another common criticism that, I doubt can be upheld in its general sense), but the book is one of the few I have ever read thatREALLY made me think about my own 'beliefs' and I found myself bouncing Dawkins' (and my own) ideas around in my head for weeks. if not months afterwards. It may indeed have it's own faults and failings but these are easily outweighed by the brilliant writing and the devastating arguments herein.<br /><br />To read more on the subject, try the other episodes in the unholy trinity; Hitchens' '[[ASIN:B0064M9WHK God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]' and Dennett's '[[ASIN:0141017775 Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'.REALLY made me think about my own 'beliefs' and I found myself bouncing Dawkins' (and my own) ideas around in my head for weeks. if not months afterwards.

B004YJZBCK|5.0|Don't overthink... just buy it!  It's the best album by one of the great bands of alltime.  And the remastering by Hoffman and the guys at Audio Fidelity shines like a shooting star.(I didn't just write that, did I?)
B0081L37Z0|1.0|It is so sad that they took a really good tv show and turned it into a very horrible movie.  It's sad at how many people thought it was good.  I watched it to the end just because I didn't want to waste the money I had spent but I would not recommend it or re-watch it.  I cannot believe the former actors from the tv series agreed to have spots in the movie.  I really like Channing Tatum and he is the sole reason I bought the movie and watched it but I think this is one of those movies he should either leave off of his resume or put it at the bottom in very small print.
B004X0XA82|5.0|I was a pretty big fan of Fleet Foxes' self titled debut album, I instantly felt that it represented things that i hadn't heard in music in a while. It had a very organic natural feel to it, and sounded more like a folk album that would have been released 40 years ago. However, there was always something about it as a whole, that didn't seem to work, like something was causing it to come up just short of being great. Almost as if I liked the idea of the album more so than the album itself. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the songs, as I said I was (still am) a fan of the album, but in the end there were certain songs that I'd go back to, while skipping others. The parts were greater than the sum on that work.<br /><br />Enter \\"Helplessness Blues\\".<br /><br />I picked this up the day it came out, my expectations were huge, I mean huge, and all critics were saying it was fantastic, already Album of the Year, and such. I felt that the last album was good, but this time they will probably hit it right on the mark and get everything right! Couldn't wait to play it through!<br /><br />Then, when I did, after the first go around it was just a huge thump, didn't like it at all. All the songs flowed through without any hooks, standout tracks, or memorable moments. Everything felt unfocused and confusing (this should have been my first clue, an album that flowed through and felt complex....along with my unreasonably high expectations). Needless to say, I gave it one more spin, couldn't get through it, and then shelved \\"Helplessness Blues\\" deep in my collection.<br /><br />A while later, one day while looking for something different to listen to in my collection I pick up \\"Helplessness Blues\\" just out of curiosity. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me before (obviously I know now what the issue was) but this album JUST CLICKED with me that day, and i played it through and though for the next couple of days. This album is a  strange and gorgeous musical journey. It just took time to discover that.<br /><br />The original problem was that my expectation of what the album should be was so high. Instead of just relaxing and taking the journey, with all thoughts left at the door, I was waiting for something and looking for something that \\"I\\" thought they should do. Oh how dumb that is.<br /><br />Here is an album where the sum is greater or equal to the parts contained within. This is meant to be listened to in full, and due to the complexity, payed attention to. There are many wonderful melodies buried in here, and some very thoughful lyrics sung with a soaring peaceful voice, that bleeds honesty and sencerity. It just took a clear mind to discover that.<br /><br />This is a much better, and well rounded album. The debut gave us a taste of what Fleet Foxes were about, and peaked an interest in many people, myself included. Here with \\"Helplessness Blues\\" they bring it all together to create a masterpiece of modern folk.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy, it's like taking a stroll through the deep woods, and discovering something new and different with each twist and turn.
B004J713JW|5.0|The concert is great in it's own right, but it's also part of a documentary called \\"Last Play at Shea\\" that chronicles the history of Shea Stadium, interspersed with Billy Joel's music.  Both are worth having!

0688170528|3.0|I started this book when I was down with a cold yesterday and today, when my cold felt a little better, I still stayed firmly planted, Kindle in hand, riveted by this story.<br /><br />I felt in ways that it was very realistic, I remember having many of the same feelings and thoughts as a teenager.  I was surprised to see them so well portrayed in the book.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Other parts were unrealistic- I found Chris to be too different from any teenaged boy I have ever met.  He was obsessive past the point of endearment at times.  I found it unlikely that without knowing what happened to Emily at McDonald's, or how it affected her, he would help her kill herself.<br /><br />I was disappointed that her sexual abuse was not revealed by the end of the book to everyone.  To me, this leaves the characters forever bound in doubt, confusion and a place of limbo.<br /><br />I was shocked that Melanie did not reveal the diary by the end of the book and that the contents were not revealed to us, especially when it was hinted in the courtroom scene that the art therapist's testimony brought something from the journal to Melanie's mind.<br /><br />All in all, it was an excellent book that had a less-than excellent ending.

0345444051|3.0|The story starts off in a familiar fashion. Familiar probably because so many sci-fi plots, such as TV mini-series V and Independence Day, have taken inspiration from this work to develop their own ideas and storylines: At the brink of our exploration into space, ships show up unannounced overtop all the major cities of the world. We realize we're not alone in the universe as we're introduced to an alien species, of whose intent with us we are completely unsure.<br /><br />This species will not reveal its motives or even its face at first, but it seems to want to help us. It prompts us to get rid of war, famine and poverty, uniting as a planet. No longer do we focus on frivolities of religion or nationality.<br /><br />With everything running so smoothly, for some reason humanities' creativity is also squashed. No one wants to create new symphonies, sculptures, paintings or literary works of any importance. No one has any desire for scientific breakthroughs, even though our Overlords don't share much of their technology or knowledge with us, knowing greater things exist and seeing it for ourselves apparently makes it more or less pointless to pursue.<br /><br />It's an interesting prospect, I suppose, but I can't see something like this crushing our creativity. With more time for leisure and more unanswered questions than we ever dreamed were possible, I can't imagine we'd be so passive and boring about our newfound place in life.<br /><br />But all of that doesn't really even matter so much to this story. It's just laying down the blanket for us to have our picnic lunch. A lunch that is ultimately disappointing, not for the nourishment it supplies or denies us, but the way in which it is delivered.<br /><br />This is a story of ideas, nothing more. We are simply told, time and again, what happens instead of seeing it unfold before us through the words and actions of the characters involved. My biggest gripe with a lot of sci-fi is that the ideas are truly brilliantand foreshadow the eventualities of humanity, but the communication of them takes precedence over the art of subtle storytelling. It's a pandering to the audience, that we can't interpret the message unless it's shouted to us in an obvious manner.<br /><br />The last 30 pages of the book are wholly unneeded and appear to be tacked on to simply answer our question of the Overlords more than actually advance the plot in any way. At that point, there is no more plot -- we are just waiting for the tying up of loose ends which have little importance in this tale. The only good thing I can say about this last part of the novel is that the weakness and fears of the Overlords are revealed.<br /><br />This book would've been better if the entire first part, the laying of the blanket -- the explaining of the Overlords' new place in the lives of humanity -- had been divulged in a few pages instead of fifty. And then if the story was told through the turmoil and strife of humanity coming to an end, or the role the Overlords take in facilitating that, instead of simply telling us over and over again like a boring middle school history textbook what transpires and the effects it has on these creatures.<br /><br />As with so much sci-fi, this book is worth reading for the ideas and the introspective questions it presents the audience about humanity's place and importance in the universe, however the path it takes to reveal these ideas to us is mind-numbingly boring. My fault, I suppose, for wanting to eat a delectably decadent cake in addition to having it crafted with stunning artistry.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|Alright, the story was kind of weak, considering all the sources the writers had to draw on.  And did Rose McGowan really turn down Red Sonja to play this role?<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I'd watch Jason Mamoa do anything, but I genuinely like him as Conan.  That little kid who played Conan at the first of the movie kicked butt.  The action was good, and the story didn't get bogged down.  I prefer it to Arnold's versions, and hope they make another.

0425263908|4.0|I was suffering from severe withdrawls after reading the 50 shades trilogy 3 times through. I found this book at my local warehouse and read through the reviews and the first few pages, and thought, hey why not? First off, it is nearly identical to 50 shades. Rich, too hot man lusting after a 20 something gorgeous girl who doesn't get why he wants her, you get it. The writing is far superior to 50 shades, and is much more literal genius than that of 50 Shades. The sex scenes are fantastic, not too much redundancy in them and more erotic in my opinion. The reason I believe it to be a better read than 50 shades is the female character, Eva, in the book has her own demons, as her male counterpart, Gideon, and that's about the only difference between the 2 books. I totally recommend the book and cannot wait until October.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the Wool collection 1-5. I am stunned and amazed at how great of a read this was! How in the world was such a read so inexpensive??<br /><br />This is a great read about humanity's drive to expand, to create, to love - and for some to rule and manipulate. This starts out telling individual's stories from their view point living inside the silo. As the story progresses, the viewpoints start to shift more and more, broadening out giving you more of the big picture with each piece. I can't tell you how many I times I exclaimed, \\"what the heck?!!\\" and not believing what I just read. So many twists and turns, most of which I didn't see coming.<br /><br />The author did an amazing job. I'd really like to find more to this story! I'm glad my sister showed this book to me - I'm definitely spreading the word!
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Her Sweetest Downfall by Rebecca Hamilton is sort of like a prequel to The Forever Girl, as it is an introduction to that world and allows the reader to get a little more background history on the lead up events, as well as answering some of the questions that were raised in The Forever Girl. I think that the Novella was extremely well written, the characters are realistic and believeable, and by the end of the story, you feel like you know them. I look forward to more works from Rebecca Hamilton in this series, as her writing style is very enjoyable and is a hearty meal for the imagination :) Keep up the good work and keep these books coming :)

034580404X|5.0|The trilogy \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" met all my expectations.  It was extremely very erotic and something that I usually don't read but, nonetheless, it was exciting to see the many transformations that took place by the main character.

It was very entertaining and I found myself wanting to have it continue after the last book was completed.
B00005CDNF|5.0|On the group's third album from 1975 Abba took a huge musical leap upward compared to their first two albums, which had been somewhat uneven, though without in any way being weak.<br /><br />With two of the group's biggest and most timeless hits \\"Mama Mia\\" and \\"SOS\\" is the album can only be a five star release. On top of that are other big hits, which are almost as strong as the two. \\"So Long\\" is possibly the best rock 'n roll number ever recorded by Abba. \\"Bang-a-Boomerang\\" was only released as a single in selected countries, but it is a near perfect pop production, and quite on a par with many of the group's biggest hits.<br /><br />\\"I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do\\" was also a big hit in many places. A retro-inspired number (a little Fats Domino), only to a certain extent featuring the well known, the Abba sound.<br /><br />\\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" is a very nice ballad that anticipates the direction the group would explore later with songs like \\"Thank You For the Music\\", an obvious musical number.<br /><br />\\"Hey, Hey Helen\\" is an attempt at more heavy tones - and for once the group is quite successful with this. A little overlooked gem.<br /><br />A few numbers come slightly in the more trivial department, but you easily bear with this. \\"Tropical Loveland\\" and \\"Man in the Middle\\" I will put in this category, though I would not call any of them weak.<br /><br />The instrumental \\"Intermezzo no. 1 \\"is exciting enough, but may seem a little misplaced on an Abba album.

0061726834|4.0|I can't believe that this book has been out for over a year and I haven't read it!! I was hooked on Delirium from page one, and I couldn't put it down until I was finished.<br /><br />What really got me into loving Delirium has to be how beautiful this book is written. Lauren Oliver seriously is a genius..this book so stands out as one of the best written books I have ever read. The words flow so smoothly from page to page and every scene caught my attention because of the writing style. The plot of this book really intrigued me when I first heard about this book. I don't read a huge amount of dystopian books but I really liked how Lauren Oliver made this one work. She still makes us feel like we are in a familiar place, but adding the aspect of no love really changes things in the world she creates. It really makes you think how different the world would be without love, and even though it's hard at times we really do need love. At first, I really wasn't sure what to make of the main character Lena. She seemed so unsure about herself and what she wanted..she only knew what she was suppose to do..not what she wanted to do. Once she meets Alex, however, things totally change and her eyes are opened up into a new world. As the book progresses, Lena grows into such a strong willed character and realizes that you should always question, and maybe some things aren't always as they seem.<br /><br />I LOVED the relationship between Lena and her best friend Hana. While both girls are complete opposites, Hana being more of a wild child and Lena being so reserved, the two really balance each other out and have a great friendship. Hana starts to help Lena break out of her shell and realize that it's okay to go against the rules that you are suppose to follow. The relationship between Alex and Lena is so SWOON WORTHY. He is so caring and sweet, and very very handsome! From the start, I knew that Alex was going to be an awesome character. He helps her see the world in a whole different life and makes her realize that love isn't so scary. Yes, love can cause heartache and pain, but it can always bring joy and happiness. Lena soon realizes love isn't so bad at all, and she would rather have been in love then forget it all.<br /><br />The ending gets me every time..seriously the ultimate cliff hanger ever!! I can't wait to get started on the second book in the series. Definitely check this book out if your interested in reading a dystopian book with an awesome romance. One more thing, a final quote to leave you all with that really stood out in my mind in this book:<br />\\"You can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come to earth. People who love in a world without walls, people who love into hate, into refusal, against hope, and without fear.<br />I love you. Remember. They cannot take it.\\" (440-441, Delirium)

B0063IH60K|5.0|When I first reviewed this game, I have it one star because of the loud video ads even when I turned the sounds off on the game.  The developers have since fixed this glitch, and I think this is the best solitaire game out there. Thanks for listening to feedback from your customers and making improvements to the game.  As a side note, this game has the advertising model exactly right.  I am most likely to look at ads on this game and find them least obtrusive.
B000W965QW|1.0|This Kindle edition of HIGH FIDELITY was not spellchecked and is littered with typos introduced when it was scanned by optical character recognition software. Incredible.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This was a really good story....until they figured out why they were dying. The author offered up a great scenario to explain everything but failed spectacularly to make that work. I ended up with more questions than answers. Maybe I missed something. There's a part of me that wants to reread this, to see if I can make sense of that plot device but I'll give the story to my husband and see if he gets it. Then he can explain to me.<br /><br />The story was completely fascinating until the author explained what was happening. I would have given it 5 stars until I learned what was happening then I'd just call it cheesy. I had trouble putting it down and after I learned the truth I had trouble completing it just because the answer seemed so cartoon-ish.<br /><br />The codas weren't bad, but they didn't overcome the plot's problems. I was so jaded when I came to them that I had trouble reading them.<br /><br />I want to give this 2 stars, but it was a great read for a through most of book, so I'll give it three.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Having never read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works I came into this without any preconceptions. I found it to be smart, funny, thrilling and thoroughly enjoyable. Robert Downey Jr. was fantastic, as usual.
B008298NZA|5.0|A perfect offering for fans of Mike Oldfield.  This set features the new remastered versions of Mike's first six albums and offers a great way to have the updated sounds without having to spend big bucks on the \\"Deluxe\\" editions.  It was a special bonus for me, as I passed on the \\"Deluxe\\" releases for \\"Platinum\\" and \\"QE2\\" (not being interested in the live tracks that are offered as the bonus material) and this was an economical way to get those remastered editions.<br /><br />Each of the single-disc titles in this set are housed in individual matted cardboard gatefold sleeves that replicate the albums' artwork (or provide as an extra the original artwork for those that have been updated).  Extra tracks are provided, though not (of course) to the extent found on the \\"Deluxe\\" editions.<br /><br />And, of course, the music speaks for itself.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|This \\"IP Cam Viewer\\" app allows me to remotely monitor my Zmodo DVR camera system on my Kindle Fire and HTC EVO 4G. I tested the free version of the app ([[ASIN:B005KUHUKS IP Cam Viewer Free]]) which supports up to 6 cameras before upgrading to full version. This version supports all eight of my cameras and it can show all of them on screen at the same time or you can choose to view them individually. I like that it can control a PTZ camera, take still and video grabs, and supports \\"Pinch to Zoom\\" even on non-PTZ cameras.<br /><br />Configuration was remarkably easy if you have set up DDNS with a provider (we use DYDNS) and optioned the DVR system for remote access. In my case, the Zmodo system uses port 18004 for remote access and that had to be opened on my router's firewall. The app will also recommend a port if you select the correct camera/DVR maker and model number.<br /><br />This works very well and was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0307719774|5.0|I am one of those people who always wanted to keep a journal but didn't.  This book is fantastic.  It asks a question which you can either answer or skip depending on your mood.  It is just enough space to write a sentence or two about the question and a sentence or two about the day.  Perfect.  I understand all of the people who complain about the book not laying flat, being hard to write in, but that is the compromise for having something that is small enough to take with you when you travel.<br /><br />As far as not having a ribbon bookmark.  This is easily fixed with a piece of ribbon and some scotch tape.  Just tape one end of the ribbon to the bottom of the inside back cover page and wrap it around and trim to size.  Voila!  Just make sure you leave enough ribbon that it will stick out of the book on Jan 1.<br /><br />I would definitely get this book as a gift.  Especially for someone going through a life change such as starting or leaving school, new baby, marriage, etc.  But also good for anyone.  Highly recommend this book.  It's very pretty too.

0062124293|5.0|This is the kind of book you look for, and hope for, and when you find it, you tell everyone else so that they can read it, too.<br /><br />Hey everyone: this is that book.<br /><br />Being an ignorant American, I had never heard of Caitlin Moran before; I picked up this book because I thought my wife would like it, and I hoped it would be the right mix of funny and insightful to make it enjoyable for me, as well, despite my inappropriate gender.  I was right on all counts: my wife loved this book, frequently laughing out loud -- and hard enough that she snorted, too, which is the sign of a really good laugh -- and it moved her enough to read several passages aloud to me.<br /><br />Then I read it, and found what I have not seen since A.J. Jacobs or Frank McCourt  (That is not meant to be a comparison of style or theme; it reflects my reading choices, which run heavier toward fantasy and less frequently to memoir or social commentary.), which I did not find in Tina Fey's \\"Bossypants\\" or Lewis Black's \\"Nothing's Sacred\\" or the essays of Chuck Klosterman.  Caitlin Moran is hilarious and honest and interesting, all at once.<br /><br />Look: she writes about puberty.  And about being poor.  And about being fat.  And about pornography (Best line in the book is in this part, and it refers to Daddy Warbucks and a sausage.  I won't say any more.).  And about working.  And about dating.  And about being a mother.  And about abortion.  And about feminism.  The book is courageous, and touching, and humble, and inspiring.  It's awesome.<br /><br />The last thing I want to say is this: I am a feminist.  Read the book, and say the same.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|This was real, hilarious in parts, very well-acted, uplifting without being too sappy, and there is one line in this movie that made me HOWL with laughter. A description. See if it hits you, too. Really sweet movie, well worth it. And the tour of the draw... well, just rent it. Lots of fun.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE this app. Sometimes I get bored I pull up this app. The font of the numbers is beautiful.
0061537969|3.0|Wow, this book was a hard one to finish.  I love dogs and I can tolerate car racing but I just didn't really care for this story.  The first part of the book was so depressing with the dog just waiting to die.  One review talks about Denny's \\"extended rough patch\\".  Rough patch is an understatement.  The writing was alright and the premise of the story interesting but reading this always felt like a chore.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got myself addicted to Where's My Water a few months ago, so my eyes lit up when I saw this in the Android store. Then they squinted and got cheesed, because it wasn't in Amazon's store yet.<br /><br />But now it is, and I got the game. Yee-haa!<br /><br />Compared to WMW, I think this one is a touch easier. I blew through it in less than a week of sporadic play, tri-gnoming alomost all of the boards with ease. Had to work at a few for the 3 gnomes, but even the hard boards weren't as tough as one or two of WMW's.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it needs more lev.... HANG ON A SECOND!! This game cost $1. That's one heck of a deal. I will enjoy additional levels if and when they're available, but have already QUITE received my money's worth from this title.<br /><br />5 frikkin' stars.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I'm not going to write a long drawn out review. Like Slayer or Overkill when you hear Testament has a new album coming out. You kind of know what to expect but it's just how well it's pulled off. This is a great album, young bands should take notice and be shamed that guys near 50 can produce metal this amazing. Has shades of many of their great albums yet sounds fresh and new. The musicianship is tip top and there really isn't a weak track in the bunch. The solos by both Skolnick and Peterson stand out big. Even if for some insane reason someone were to not like any song the solos will blow you away. Nice cover selection too. Great album and an amazing Testament album, no doubt will be one of the best of the year.
0345803507|5.0|I read all 3 books in record time, a week a think. I was left craving for more, I love the story, it made me laugh, cry, and want to scream at times. The \\"love\\" scences are AWESOME!!  I love Christian and Ana, and I pray the author writes continued stories about them. I was sad when I finished the books, I craved for more!!<br />An EXCELLANT addition(s) to my kindle book shelve.

0143034901|3.0|You've read the plot summary; no need to repeat it. And based on the summary, I expected more. The novel begins intriguingly enough (someone wants to destroy every existing copy of works by an obscure Spanish author), but eventually it gets bogged down in gimmick after repetitive gimmick: the story within the story, the flashback told in italics, the testimony from witnesses to history, the letter penned by a dead love interest. The plot is contrived and forced, the development mechanical and formulaic, and the author tries to save it from tedium by papering the narrative with endless eccentric details about Barcelona and the characters that inhabit the city, but ultimately none of this detail moves the story forward. It simply turns the novel into an eccentric travelogue. The biggest failure is that regardless which character narrates the story, the author employs the same narrative voice, unintentionally reducing the novel to a monologue. It could have been cut in length by about one-third and still survived in a tighter, faster-paced form. If you're looking for a modern gothic novel, then this is a forgettable sample of the genre. Move along. There's nothing to see here.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is not so much an ode to geeks and great minds as much as a celebration of them. I've gotten really attached to the characters over the years, and when a television show becomes something that means this much to you it's not just a television show. From the get-go The Big Bang Theory was a great, well-thought out show with a fantastic cast of actors, clever references to science, comics/superheroes, pop culture etc. This was something else, different and creative while being at the same time laugh out loud hilarious (I hate when people use those words and it's not even true, with TBBT it's actually true) and at times I find myself laughing hard even though I only have a glimpse of an idea of what they meant (hey I don't have a PhD in physics after all!). The thing is the show is so clever and funny at the same time and I think there's so appeal to it for everyone who enjoys a laugh or two. The concept of two gifted minds living together in an apartment both working at a University in physics and being brilliant, sometimes humorous, sometimes childish along with their friends and neighbors was a fresh one and the finished product turned out, well obviously great. You may think I'm exaggerating when I say that each and every single episode is memorable somehow, but it's the truth.<br /><br />The main cast of characters is what truly make the show because they are instantly memorable in their own ways and we grow fond of and attach to them. Leonard Hofstadter(Johnny Galecki) is the most normal of the gang, he's smart but he's the most genuine and likable of all. His friend and roommate Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons)takes the cake; he is in the simplest terms, impossible although he would deny that suggestion. Sheldon has the highest IQ on the show, went to College when he was eleven, doesn't quite understand sarcasm and has childish tendencies such as always sitting in the same spot and likes to keep everything organized as far as having a different restaurant for each night of the week. Then there are their two friends, the self-proclaimed romantic engineer Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) who sports a Beatles haircut and has a penchant for wearing colored skinny jeans and geeky belt buckles, and Indian astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali (Kumal Naayar)who literally cannot talk to girls and has a problem digesting Indian food. Not to forget the neighbor girl, Penny (Kaley Cuoco) a girl from Omaha who is working at the cheesecake factory and although very beautiful is not very bright which always leads to interesting interactions and scenarios.<br /><br />I have to give credit where credit is due; Chuck Lorre came up with a hell of show (watch for the closing cards!), the actors are simply amazing in their respective roles and the writers must be out of this world to come up with the stuff that they do (even the episode titles are clever). The references to science, physics, superheroes and comic books, television shows, movies and pop culture are truly amazing and well integrated.<br /><br />Looking back the first season which aired in 2007-08 it's striking how well developed the characters and the show already were. For many TV shows it takes a while and sometimes a season to get ball rolling but not in this case and the more you watch it, the more you get the jokes and they stay with you because they are memorable. There's a reason this show is so beloved and popular. I used to buy many TV series on DVD even just a few short years ago but I stopped/slowed down with time. However, I knew that like a true geek, I needed to own those seasons so I could watch them over and over again.<br /><br />I've been wanting to review TBBT for a while now, but I found it hard to find the words to do it justice. Since I bought the first season on DVD they have re-released it on Blu-Ray along with season two, if I had to do it again I'd likely go for the Blu-Rays. So there you have it, 17 episodes of the first season on DVD or Blu-Ray for your enjoyment. Now I love the show and it's a too easy 5 stars for the show, this first season was quite remarkable and even sparked my interest to look up some the physics jokes they make.lu-Ray for your enjoyment. Now I love the show and it's a too easy 5 stars for the show, this first season was quite remarkable and even sparked my interest to look up some the physics jokes they make.
006197806X|5.0|Let me start by saying that I was already a fan or Delirium when i picked up this book to read it, and boy I was not disappointed! I can't say enough positive things about this book! Yes it is kind of part of the whole dystopian young adult book thing that is popular right and yes it is yet another trilogy (like The Hunger Games) but Lauren Oliver has created something with her books that I haven't seen in many of the other books in this genre. Oliver has managed to produce a beautifully written, deep, page-turner. I can't remember the last time a book has actually made me have a physical reaction, but the book, Pandemonium, made me get choked up several times.<br /><br />Oliver knows how to pull at your heart strings one moment and make your heart race the next.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this series to anyone looking for a quick, fast-paced read that is still substantial enough to give the reader something to hold onto.<br /><br />And just as a warning Lauren Oliver can write some wicked cliff-hangers...so prepare yourself =)

B000001FFR|4.0|Of all the other major thrash bands, Anthrax is one of the few who sounded almost upbeat instead of using the much grimmer sounds of most thrash bands.  While I have no problem with either sound, if I ever get weary of such grim songs, I can switch to the much more fun sounding Anthrax.  And who could possibly forget driving down the streets of Vice City causing mayhem to \\"Madhouse\\" in Grand Theft Auto Vice City?
B004YM6JI2|1.0|As all Supernatural Fans will agree seasons 1-5 were superb! Although not perfect and plagued with plot holes was done well and is a shining example of quality television. Season 6 wasn't bad, the Eve storyline was nice as a sub-plot the real plot, control of the \\"Souls\\" for the war in heaven. The actual \\"Soul\\" plot had nasty plot holes but was ambitious and should have been both season 6 and 7, it could have been that good. Instead season 6 felt rushed, especially at the very end when in fact ALL of season six, at least Sam and Deans involvement in it (and Death's help) was to prevent the baddies of season 7 from getting freed.... Death thought it important enough to ask Dean to \\"keep digging\\",,,, these Leviathans must be some bad @$$ baddies.... Instead we're treated to sub par villains with petty shallow ambitions and desires and a plan that in fact Death should have thought a funny joke, NOT help Sam and Dean....<br /><br />All in all season 7 was a larger waste that season 6. As bad as season 6 was it's still could be considered a gold standard when compared to season 7. Unfortunately they're going to do a season 8, when it should've ended at season 5 but it is what it is. I don't want to blame Sara Gamble for the shoddy seasons but I guess who else can I blame so since she's gone I can't help but hope for a better season and also for an ending of the show, hopefully on a good note. Then and maybe then we can look back on season 7 with some sense of assisting season 8 end what was once a GREAT show....<br /><br />PS: Sadly I will be buying season 7,,,, just to keep the collection in tact. I know I shouldn't give Sara Gamble the pleasure of it but the show gave me such good fond TV moments, some of the best ever that I feel I owe em that much....<br /><br />PSS: If I had to rate seasons from 1-5 stars then seasons 1-5 would get 6 stars, season 6 would get 3 and season 7 one (1) sad little star,

0670022950|4.0|This gets into a lot more detail that I cared for on the functioning of every torture device of the middle ages - a little too gory.  But the back ground of how people existed back then - and why so many killed each other - keeping the population down.  His explorations into why violence decreased - the printing press and the equivalent of the dime store romance novel - I would have never made the connection - but his study is thorough and deep.  So the book held my attention.  I originally read the Kindle version - and the charts and graphs were indecipherable.  I purchased the hard back for a GI coffeehouse library near an Army base.  I didn't aways agree with all the theory, but celebrate the optimism of his results - things are getting better - despite all the \\"if it bleeds it leads\\" that continually shows blood & guts on the local news.  I'm a peacenik and hope that we can continue the journey toward a better world.  I remember the Beatles in the 60's - singing of the \\"Age of Aquarius!!!\\".
B005LAII12|2.0|Seth McFarlane has really re-defined animation for television with \\"Family Guy,\\" going where even the Simpsons would not dare tread.  His transition into the big screen does not work well, and \\"Ted\\" is a mindless and trite extended sitcom.  Actually, it would be entertaining if it were an extended sitcom -- in fact, it's just a childish concept desperately searching for a meaningful plot.<br /><br />If you've watched \\"Family Guy\\" enough times, you'll find the jokes here the same-old same-old.  There's a lot of gay jokes, and you'll hear all the familiar voices.  Imagine Brian the dog as now Ted the teddy bear, and that's the whole movie.

B00005JNEW|5.0|There's a rawness and a grittiness to the film that makes it difficult to watch in some emotional moments, and compelling to watch throughout.  Odessa, Texas is a football town, which is to say that all that anyone cares about is whether the high school football team will win the state championships or not.  The players on the team are local celebrities, and they're treated to free meals and a lot of sex and attention.  But many don't live in the moment -- they live for football because ultimately that's all that they have, and it's their one-way ticket out of Odessa.  That's the central conflict in this heavy drama.<br /><br />This is a football movie, and if you're seen one you've seen them all.  The plot follows every other conventional football movie with the final season and everyone's dreams coming down to the last second.  But the director Peter Berg has assembled a sympathetic ensemble of young actors who shoulder well the heavy burden of bringing dramatic tension to a conventional football movie.
0345803493|4.0|I know it's oh so trendy to hate on these books and write bad reviews for them, but this particular book I really enjoyed. I felt the writing in this one was much better than in the first of the series. Although there is still a lot of gratuitous sex, there is a story line as well that evolves nicely throughout the book. I read the first book and thought it was a bit silly, but this one had a lot more going for it, and at one point actually brought me to tears. The characters are better formed and are more likeable in this book, as their personalities evolve. Maybe I'm just getting immune to the sex scenes, but this one seems less smutty than the first. It was a good read and I couldn't put it down. What more can you ask from a novel?

Long book for a kindle book also, its real annoying when u turn the page and that equals 1 percent of the book.  Loved all the characters, wasnt bored at anypoint in the book.  David Gemmel for years has been my  favorite fantasy author... this is equal to his work if not better than some.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The bad reviews on this book are hilarious.  I actually enjoyed reading them (after I had already read it).  They made me laugh...especially the one by \\"meymoon\\" in California.  She is totally right!  Yes, the writing is not excellent.  Yes, the characters are cheesy and unbelievable.  But yet I still really enjoyed reading it.  Why, exactly, I haven't much of a clue.  Maybe it's because I'm married, 42, and have a pretty ho-hum (but happy) life.  It was nice to just get lost in the fantasy of this book and remember back to when I was 21.  And the sex scenes are rather \\"stimulating\\", I must say.  I now know why my husband bought this book for me.  :)  Note: I'm reading the second book in the trilogy now and it's actually better than the first.

B004PYDBEO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it gave a different perspective on the efficient market theory.  These are some things from the book which I thought were very helpful.  \\"...it is not certain that using the bell curve is the best way to measure stock-market risk; it is easy, but not necessarily right. Second, to build efficient portfolios you need good forecasts of earnings, share prices, and volatility for thousands of stocks. Otherwise, garbage in, garbage out. Finally, for each stock, you must laboriously calculate its \\"covariance\\" with, or how it fluctuates against, every other stock\\".<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about some of the assumptions made by economists.  The book indicates that \\"An economist makes assumptions about how markets work, how businesses operate, how people make financial decisions\\".<br /><br />Author of How To Win More With A Trend Trading System For Stocks

B00846REIS|4.0|... had it had better writing. Strikingly similar to Fifty Shades (almost to the point of being fanfic-like). That being said, I wish someone had told me to read this INSTEAD of Fifty Shades, because the characters are much more relatable and believable, as is the plot. The characters are flawed and all have back stories that are alluded to but not delved fully into yet. I look forward to the sequel.

B0079XPUOW|1.0|I have enjoyed many of John Scalzi's novels, and I am a particular fan of the Old Man's War series, for all the poorly-reasoned politics in it.  So I was hoping for an engaging read with \\"Redshirts.\\"  Alas, it fails to deliver.  This is basically a satire on the well-known recurring theme of Star Trek, when Kirk, Spock, Bones, and a couple of red-shirted Security men beam down to the planet -- the red shirted guys always buy the farm but the main actors and actresses are always unscathed.  Unfortunately, Scalzi just wasn't able to turn this satiric theme into a workable novel, and I found this to be a disappointing and tedious read.  RJB.
0307719219|1.0|This book is interesting, but its major argument is simplistic.  Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson place the lion's share of the blame for underdevelopment in poor countries around the world on the adoption of bad governmental and economic institutions.  The path to progress, they argue, is to have good institutions; the path to failure is to have bad ones.  While there is truth in such a proposition, it is nonetheless highly misleading.  Let me explain.  I doubt than anyone would disagree with the notion that to have healthy populations countries need good health care systems (doctors, clinics, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, etc.), and to have an educated citizenry countries need good educational systems (teachers, schools, universities, research laboratories, etc.).  The real issue is how poor countries get the highly desirable health and educational systems.  The harsh reality is that such systems or institutions are not easy to acquire.  This is not simply a matter of choice, as Acemoglu and Robinson seem to suggest.  If it were, then practically every country would have healthy and well-educated populations, and most do not.  The reason is that good health and education infrastructures require robust revenues; robust revenues spring from prosperous economies; and prosperous economies ultimately derive from favorable circumstances in the spheres of external relations, the environment, natural resources, population dynamics, and governance.  The same holds true for good governmental and economic institutions--to obtain them countries need strong foundational contexts.  Acemoglu and Robinson ignore the fact that mal-functioning institutions and sputtering production processes in many poor countries are directly linked to problematic climates, geography, and resource endowments.  These authors also discount the enormous problems faced by tropical areas growing food and maintaining healthy populations in the face of deadly diseases that thrive in hot and humid climates.<br />Acemoglu and Robinson begin their book with a reference to the U.S.-Mexico border, pointing to the differences in living standards in Nogales, Sonora versus Nogales, Arizona.  The Mexican side, they say, is poorer than the U.S. side because Mexico's institutions do not work as well as those in the United States.  It is a fact that Mexico is less prosperous than its northern neighbor and that it has weaker institutions.  But to conclude that those weaker institutions account for Mexico's profound economic problems is a mighty stretch.  To back up their claim that Mexico is just another country that has foolishly passed up opportunities to adopt good institutions, Acemoglu and Robinson recount select historical events and what they believe to be mistaken decisions by Mexican leaders.  Anyone who knows the history of Mexico well, however, will quickly see that Acemoglu and Robinson rely on cherry-picked and un-contextualized history.  These authors cite fragments of the past as their major source of evidence not only for Mexico, but for numerous other countries as well to make their grandiose case that institutions are the major deterministic causes of underdevelopment.  It will be up to historians of all the countries cited as examples by Acemoglu and Robinson to check the efficacy of the history presented in Why Nations Fail.

B004G6TCIA|5.0|This is classic ELP, a must have for any fan of the trio, and not just because it was a commercial success, quickly going Gold in the US and ranking only behind Trilogy on their chart hits. (Across the pond, where it hit number 1, it edges out Trilogy in that regard.) It has a nice range, from the haunting \\"Stones of Years\\" and the beautiful hymn (that challenges us to assume personal responsibility and live our faith consciously) \\"The Only Way\\" to the upbeat, fun rock \\"Are You Ready Eddy\\".
0345803485|2.0|Written in the style of `Bridget Jones` I soon come upon similarities to the film `Notting Hill`. Firstly the interview scene -  In `Fifty Shades` she interviews him, and in `Notting Hill` he interviews Her. Next comes the shop scene. He goes into the shop where she works, in `Notting Hill` she goes into the shop where he works. A little further on and we have Christian ordering everything on the breakfast menu after their night of passion because he doesn`t know what Ana would like, ( remember `Pretty Woman`?) Then we have `Indecent Proposal` with the whole `being whizzed off in the helicopter thing`, and I have to ask myself at this point how much of `Fifty Shades` was actually written by the author, and how much hijacked from various popular `Chick Flicks`.<br /><br />I have to agree with some of the other comments. The book is boring and seriously repetitive over- kill. It`s like watching a porn movie; lots of sex with no real storyline. As for Mr Gray I would give him a wide birth. Why would I want to be completely controlled and subjected to pain? I have serious concerns about today`s society if this is what women are getting off on. Call me old fashioned and believe me I`m certainly no prude, but I prefer an air of mystery and the use of my imagination.
1612183956|5.0|The Pines is a fast paced thriller taking place in Idaho.  Secret service agent Ethan Burke wakes up with barely any memory of how he got to Wayward Pines, Idaho.  Besides his injuries, he's missing all of his personal effects.  The people in the town are very nice to him but he can't figure out why no one is calling him back from his field office.  Or why his wife has not contacted him.  There's something off about the whole situation and he can't rest until he figures out what is going on.  I'm not going to give more of the plot away than that.  Blake Crouch does a great job of suspending the story and keeping Ethan jumping from one situation to another.  Not only that, but there's a constant split between the supernatural and the natural.  Is Ethan Burke a victim of just bad timing or is there some other force at work? And what is that other force?  Supernatural or natural?  I received this book at 4pm.  Started reading at 6pm.  And then I could not put it down.  It's rare that I find a book that just grabs me and won't let me put it down.  This is one such book.  Recommended.

0547569653|4.0|Scott Jurek is a tough cookie. He can run; run for a very long time, log more than a 100miles in a day and can run in pain. He finishes races by crushing his opponents and obliterates existing records. Scott Jurek is an elite athlete and `Eat and Run' is his story. A story, by all means a personal account, about how a Midwesterner kid who works very hard during his childhood to support his family and takes up running initially as a means of escape, but slowly (after years of training hard and running) transcends into mental state - a zone - where he experiences greatness (more on the lines of a spiritual discovery) and starts enjoying the race rather than focusing on the finish line.<br /><br />It is during this time that he turns into a vegan (while worrying about all the time about his protein intake), obsesses on the importance of eating well and  wins 100miles races one after the other as if it were a just matter of fact. While 3/4th of this book is dedicated to showcasing the races in which in he has run (and won), it is his experiences and thoughts while running are what make this book so worthwhile to read. Though he can run 100 or 150 miles, Scott Jurek is just like any one of us and has to deal with everyday problems.<br /><br />He goes great length to prove that running or any other endurance sport is more of a mind game than physical prowess and has nothing to do with innate traits, and drives home this point through his life experiences - that being resilient, determined and tenacious can help you survive and overcome obstacles. Note that this book is not a training manual for running marathons or ultra marathons; though there are a few pieces of advice (and vegan recipes) strewn at the end of each chapter to run and eat better.<br /><br />In the end you don't have to be runner to appreciate what Scott has to tell. There is a lot to take away from this book other than recollecting the grueling races which these endurance athletes endure.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Someone at work really recommended this book. \\"You must read it because it's such a good book!\\" I generally liked that person and downloaded the book to my kindle. As I started reading it... Well, I had to stop. And it had nothing to do with the subject discussed. The writing is awful. Simply horrid. It's like the author didn't even try! I felt insulted. The characters, especially the main heroine, were annoying. At one point, I thought that if the girl says \\"holy crap!\\" one more time or talks of her \\"inner goddes\\", I will kill her. Just make her stop talking. I got half way (64%) through and had to stop. I found absolutely nothing erotic about it. The whole thing was handled poorly. Save some money. If someone wants, don't buy it. I can lend it to you via kindle. Please save your money.

B000W4KT64|5.0|Bringing Broadway to screen isn't exactly the easiest task in the world, but somehow, director/choreographer Adam Shankman did just that with seeming ease with HAIRSPRAY, a lively, endlessly inventive adaptation that won me over with its insanely infectious songs, strong performances all around (Blonsky is a revelation, but Travolta was the real surprise here), snappy choreography, plenty of sharp humor and a great deal of heart and soul. If you haven't had the opportunity to see this, I beg of you: buy it A.S.A.P. It's a decision you won't regret.

0345529057|5.0|After watching the first season of Game of Thrones on DVD, I wanted more context and detail on all of the events that were happening. And since the books are fairly long, I figured there'd be plenty of it. It turns out that the series is very true to the books in most details, so if you've seen the first season, the first book won't hold many surprises. That said, it never bored me despite that, and definitely provided all the extra context and details I'd been wanting. It's such a delightfully vicious, intriguing fantasy tale, with plenty of cruel people, terrible backstabbing, and unexpected deaths or turnabouts.<br /><br />The series as a whole was a delight to read, and I couldn't bear to put it down for any other books while I was reading it. Book four did get a bit  more depressing than the others, and it certainly left me hanging. The four books don't cover nearly as much ground as you'd expect in terms of time passed, since the world is so expansive. It's great to get to see things from various characters' perspectives as the tale progresses.<br /><br />I very rarely buy hardcovers, preferring to wait for paperback editions, but for once it was just killing me not to read the next book, so I went and got the hardcover of book five. That's how delightful I found this series.
B0086700CM|4.0|I personally think this is a pretty good game.  It is repetitious, however, that is part of the challenge.

B0058ZPNOK|3.0|Young T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father, Paul (Rainn Wilson), are still reeling from a family tragedy that has left them both depressed and isolated. They live with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and barely communicate with anyone in the darkened and dismal home. By chance, T.J. crosses paths with Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a homeless metalhead who ends up forcing his way into their lives. This movie is about how Hesher's violent, foul-mouthed, seemingly nihilistic influence creates both chaos and peace among the members of this fractured and failing family.<br /><br />As I watched the film, I hoped and prayed that it would not follow the same path as every other Eccentric Outsider Helps Struggling Group Find Peace And Unity movie that has ever existed from [[ASIN:B000MRNWKG Harry and the Hendersons]] to [[ASIN:B000065V3P Captain Ron]] to [[ASIN:B0060D11OU Mary Poppins]] ... sorry, I'm sure there are more examples, but those are the first three that came to mind. My examples are comedies, and HESHER certainly pretends (in parts) to be a comedy, but this is, in fact, a very dark film, and even the faux-happy ending that is tacked on does little to lighten the grimness that both the script and Hesher seem compelled to force onto the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, although Hesher isn't as cheesy of a guiding/unifying force as a drunken captain or lost Sasquatch or prim-n-proper magical maid, the script fails to put him in a position that is very unique to stories of this ilk. He even has a big speech at the end where The Moral is dutifully imparted (albeit in an amusingly crass and chaotic way) to the family who finally Learns Their Lesson. Hesher's influence is many times baffling and arbitrary, which lead me to believe that this odd little film was going to trod a different path, but in the end, first time writer/director Spenser Susser just couldn't go beyond the basic moral framework that you always find in these films.<br /><br />In spite of the aggressively dismal script and fairly standard emotional arc, the movie's performances are absolutely seamless. Wilson, Levitt, Laurie, and Portman do incredible work as their characters. They take the mess of the script and find true and meaningful pathos in it. Major props especially go to Brochu, who does a stellar job as the lead character, evincing the kind of depth of emotion you rarely find in child stars these days. Although the story is alienating and depressing and ultimately nothing all that new, there is richness to be found simply in watching these excellent actors inhabit their world, no matter how mundane or glum it may be.ressively dismal script and fairly standard emotional arc, the movie's performances are absolutely seamless.

B003YCI1O8|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />This is just a good old fashioned giant monster movie, or you could call it,\\" Jaws\\" in the sand. It is also a buddy film, a comedy, & a hell of a good time!<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" is filled with great special effects that still hold up well today. It's giant carnivorous worms are original to say the least, but these worms eat the fisherman, as they attack anything making vibrations on the ground, like Great White sand sharks! This makes for some very good suspenseful moments!<br /><br />\\"Val\\" (Kevin Bacon) & \\"Earl\\" ( the very underrated Fred Ward) make for the buddy part of the film, & have great chemistry playing off one another, with funny lines, bickering, & superior acting, you'd think these two had been friends for years. They really make this movie work, along with a great cast of character actors, playing misfits, in a misfit desert village (I don't think it quite qualifies as a town) , way off the asphalt path. Especially good are Michael Gross & Rebecca McEntire, as a married couple that are survivalists, armed to the ears waiting to wage war, but not the kind they think.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Tremors\\" is a classic up date of giant mutated monster movies of the 50's. It's funny flowing script, it's superior acting, editing, direction, & lastly, it's great special effects will make any monster movie lover happy! Just don't feed the worms.<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" 1990<br /><br />[...]

The option exists to play each game individually, or to follow mental exercise programs designed to increase in difficulty as your performance improves.

B006PKV2QU|4.0|I do like rhyming books. This didn't quite flow in some spots for me with rhythm and rhyme. Some of it was just the text placement (wrapping sentences when a return, with the rhyming words on the end of the line would have helped break it up better). I read it both on my computer (cloud) and some of the text placement was off. When I read it to my boys, we used the Ipad (upright, single page view) and the presentation was good. It got a little silly (aliens, gremlins, ghosts) and I had to remind my boys were were talking about what the lump in his shoe might be (that question came so quick at the beginning that kids almost needed a reminder of WHAT we were talking about). Cute ending. I really liked the illustrations.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|As author of [[ASIN:B00870ELDM Dreams from the Death Age (The Book of Baker)]] I know how hard it can be to expose yourself in your books and reveal a Truth that is so important to you. I can only do that through my novels using humor to reveal deeper truths. I greatly respect Ruiz because he has the courage to hit these subjects directly and he's a master at understanding and communicating the true essence of love and relationships. This is a wonderful and empowering book, my elderly mother who was the victim of my abusive father read it in my home not long before her death and she loved it. I am sure it freed her spirit and empowered her to acknowledge who she really was. I recently sent it to my 22 year old daughter suffering from her first big relationship breakup to try and ease the pain. I highly recommend it for anyone who seeks to understand the workings of the human heart and to live their life more authentically.
B007SSEU9O|2.0|I considered giving this film more stars just because of the excellence of Meryl Streep's performance, but in the end, I couldn't ignore the fact that I stopped watching before it was over.<br /><br />Why? Because the script and the vehicle used to tell Thatcher's story was so dreadful.<br /><br />It's an old and hackneyed vehicle.  Thatcher's \\"story\\" is told via flashbacks, which in and of itself isn't a problem, but The Iron Lady devotes what seems like 50% of the screen time to a current-day view of a frail, pitiful old woman suffering from dementia and haunted by the ghost of her late husband.  The makeup is great, and the performance is terrific, but this is a biopic, and the massive amounts of screen time devoted to this pitiful old woman adds absolutely nothing to our understanding of Margaret Thatcher the politician or Margaret Thatcher the prime minister.<br /><br />OK, she adored her father. Got it. She stood up to men in the UK at a time when that wasn't done. Got it. People underestimated her.  Got it.  I would like to have learned more, but we kept returning to the demented old woman haunted by her husband's ghost.  Yawn. Was this supposed to be the portrait of a woman's downfall?  Are we supposed to feel pity for her?  I really never got the point, and frankly I was bored.

B005DJRD80|4.0|First of all, I will come right out and say that I am not a fan of MTV, and when and if this show ever goes off the air (God forbid), it will, in all likelehood, stay that way. With the countless and eye-rollingly tedious reality (so-called) programs continuing to infect modern day television, I might as well head to Beverly Hills and sit in on an everyday convo between Rich Bitch Money Bags 1 and 2-believe me, it would be no different than what MTV has to offer. That is why, atleast in part, I was so surprised at my reaction to Awkward; the other reason being that, while it does hold a similar plotline to numerous teen dramedies and novels, it is so charmingly written and boasts some clever, young players who each bring something to the screen that sadly is falling short in actors of this generation: charisma. I cannot stress enough how sad it is to see the new \\"style\\" of acting being popularized by your Kristen Stewarts and Robert Pattinsons continue to thrive: instead of actually giving the character some color and depth, let's channel the most bland, most personality-lacking human being on the planet and convince the masses this is what performing is. All I can say is, while it is slim, there is hope, as long as the casting directors who hired the actors on Awkward continue to breathe.<br /><br />Awkward tells the story of Jenna Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), an unpopular young girl who faces the greatest challenge of human existence: surviving the hell fires of High School. Having been conceived while her parents were High School students themselves, Jenna tries to live life quietly and avoid repeating their mistakes. This plan goes astray one night at a summer party when Jenna has a random hookup-with the most popular and good-looking guy in school: Matty McKibben (Beau Mirchoff), who after a night of closet passion, explains to her that their relationship must be kept a secret given (put nicely) the difference in their social standings. Hurt and confused, Jennais suddenly made aware of her existence-or rather nonexistence-on the social map, and made even more so by the arrival of an anonymous, and ultimately cutting letter, reading: \\"Jenna, as you are now, you could disappear forever and no one would notice.\\" With nothing but two close friends, Ming and Tamara (Jessica Lu and Jillian Rose Reed), and a personal blog to vent her teenage angst, Jenna writes that she wishes she could just die. Meant metaphorically, this simple phrase becomes a catalyst for a massive misunderstanding when Jenna has a freak and irony-ridden accident...that is mistaken for a suicide attempt! Now known around school as \\"that girl who tried to kill herself\\" Jenna finds herself not only put on the social map, but in the red zone. She is now at the mercy of High School mean girl Sadie (Molly Tarlov), a character so evil that you'd think they'd paint her green and make Jenna wear red slippers. From that point on, she serves as the main villian of the season, backed by her ultra-Christian and slightly brain-dead friend, Lissa (Greer Grammer), doing nothing but trying to wipe Jenna off the map forever. The incident also serves to introduce two other characters: Valerie (Desi Lydic), the High School counselor (who has got to be the most out-of-control and hilariously-stupid character ever written), and Jake (Brett Davern), the High School jock with the heart of gold, who incidentally happens to be Matty's best friend and the boyfriend of Lissa. He, unlike anyone Jenna has ever known, instantly sees her for the unique girl she is, eventually developing feelings for her. This goes unnoticed by Jenna for a good portion of the season as she is too wrapped up in her secret relationship with Matty to notice anything else. As the story progresses, relationships are born, broken, born again, etc, while all the while, the mystery of who wrote the dreaded letter continues to haunt Jenna as well as inadvertently guide her to change into a stronger, more self-respecting person.<br /><br />Let me just say, this story is Twilight minus the vampire-werewolf cliché and the whiny, soap opera dialogue. You have a young, insecure girl who falls for the handsome, yet hard-to-get stud while becoming unconsciously drawn to the sweet and sensitive best friend. Yes, the story is nothing new, but thanks to some competent writing and some really impressive acting (especially from Ashley Rickards and Molly Tarlov), it, instead of feeling like a reboot, comes out looking like what every one of these teen-triangle dramas wanted to be but lacked the goods to deliver. In my opinion, Rickards is the one who should be getting roles that your blind, deaf and dumb casting directors keep giving to human-piece-of-driftwood Kristen Stewart. Here is a young girl who actually has that thing we call talent, and obviously studied who her character was upon reading the script so as to make her interesting instead of deciding to do the whole thing on valium. Beau Mirchoff, while he may not bring as much charisma to the screen as some of his costars do, does a fine job at playing the charming, slightly-stuck up popular boy. He doesn't necessarily shine here, but he does make the character feel real and likeable, even though there were some points where his delivery felt like line-reading. Given that statement, he does have potential and will definitely grow as a performer should the show continue to gain recognition. Same goes for Brett Davern, who, while I am officially Team Matty, I have to give more props to on his ability to make his character shine. Based on statistics, it looks as though most of the female viewers find him the better love interest, and I have to admit, I understand this because Davern knows how to act the charming sweetheart. He is not wishy-washy or over the top in his cuteness, in fact, his kind nature feels so genuine throughout that even Team Matty shouldn't blame Jenna for being drawn to him. The last thing I have to applaud thisshow on is the fact that the writers had the guts to make all of the characters flawed. While that may sound weird, I have heard enough from people about this to know I am not the only one who noticed. Jenna is often insecure in her decisions, questions herself incessently, and is, in most cases, unable to stand up for herself. Matty is cute and sweet at some points, but lacks the confidence to admit to those of his social circle how much he cares for Jenna. Jake comes closer than anyone to being perfect, but hey, aren't we all just a little tired of every male lead character being so unrealistically flawless? I know I am, regardless of how many people continue to read Nicholas Sparks novels, and I cheer whoever wrote this character. Jake is the pure one here, but also finds it difficult to remain mentally faithful to his girlfriend while becoming increasingly attracted to Jenna. Sadie is a flat out monster of course, but she serves as the oppressor that I'm sure a great many of us have in our life. Therefore, we can relate to Jenna's struggle through her. Why the characters' imperfections are vital is that it gives them something to overcome within themselves so they can grow. They are what makes this show more than a flat point A to point B scenerio, but rather an extensive character study on the mind of the american teenager, something adults can look back on and nod their heads and something us teens can relate to and strive to apply to our own lives. This show sends the message that while being young is paved with treachery, it is an adventure filled with questions that we must ourselves figure out the answer to so we can become adults.
B002BWP49M|3.0|I rate Twilight Saga: Breaking Down with five stars. This movie is awesome. I have the other three Twilight movies on DVD. I really enjoy this movie. The scenes I enjoy most in Twilight Sega: Breaking Dawn is with the wolfs. I am a wolf lover. I even have a wolf dog. I think they did a great job making those wolfs. The way they act, move, and attack is great to watch!!!!<br /><br />Three stars I rated on here wasn't for the movie. It was for the blu ray that I own. I think Blu ray sucks!!!! I have over 400 DVD movies, 150 DVD show's, and 28 blu ray's. I haven't watched many of my blu ray movies. But the one's I have watched take forever to load on my tv. Right before it goes to main menu it tells me that not all blu rays are able to play. After reading that I have to sit and wait for it to load even longer.<br /><br />I'm sorry Blu ray fan's, but I don't have a dvd that gives me any problems like that. The reason I am talking about this on here is because before I sit down to enjoy a movie I like to watch the special features first. I was almost done watching all of the special features on this blu ray, or at less the one I own. I don't know if all of the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn blu rays have this problem. But n e who, after the special features there is a What's New option. Which I am guessing is previews. I don't have cable because I have a lot of dvd's to watch. I like to watch the previews on the dvd/blu rays so I can see what new movies to add to my collection.<br /><br />Well when I clicked into Whats new with my remote it took forever to load just to tell me it's not able to read it and to try later. What kind of bull is that. How can they upgrade from DVD to blu ray and it doesn't even play right!!!!! That is my only beef I have with this movie.
034580404X|5.0|Well written books.  They are a good read.  Enjoyed them and got a great price on them.  I would recommend this trilogy to anyone.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I am a Twilight fan. I have the first two Twilight movies on DVD along with this movie. And I have the fourth Twilight movie on Blu Ray. I remember leaving the theater when I went to go see this movie, Twilight Saga: Eclipse, not liking it. I didn't remember why till just now.<br /><br />I enjoy the love story Twilight has going on, but I'm not crazy about Bella being a little hore in this movie. One minute she is in love with Edward. Who is a great guy. Then the next minute she is in love with Jake. Another great guy. She is fulling with Jake's heart. Well actually with both of their hearts. I remember back in my high school years I would have guys after me. And ya I would play them for fools. But I just don't find it fun to watch in this movie.<br /><br />I also think it is dumb that she want's to be a vampire, but she wont marry Edward. He has to talk her into it. That is so stupid. I also think the story the movie is playing out is boring. I enjoy all of the other Twilight movies, but this movie isn't doing it for me.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|If you want to change a party lead it, if you want to change a country lead it!,<br /><br />What a performance from Meryl Streep! One of her best movies if not THE BEST! She is quite unbelievable. Forget Deer Hunter, and the Devil wears Prada. She is probably the only actrice alive today that can put together such a performance.<br /><br />I understand that some people didn't like the back and forth between now as a sick individual and the past as a powerful LEADER. I also understand that some people thought that this movie is an insult to a great leader. However, while at the beginning I was frustrated too, by the end of the movie you get the message. This movie unlike many people try to make you think is homage to Margaret Thatcher's life, character and will. She is winning against the disease too.<br /><br />Never compromise. This is absolutely true for Maggie. She is fighting a terrible incurable disease now the same way she fought the other diseases that were taking over her country at the time she was Prime Minister. She is not confused at all as many people try to make you believe. The very end of the movie shows you what Maggie is all about. She is packing all of her husband's stuff, and she tells him: if I don't hear you don't exist; you are dead.<br /><br />The movie shows briefly her confrontations with the unions as a secretary of Education. The things that she said then can be applied to today's society easily.<br /><br />This movie is very actual, and there are so many similarities with the current political situation in the world that it will be very difficult for me to summarize them. You must watch the movie! And learn. Try to find leaders and try to convince them to run for office and let them try to change the world for the better. Do not let the politicians run for office. Find the leaders!<br /><br />When Maggie first decided to run, she was convinced she is not going to win, but she wanted to make a point. Airey Neave then told her the famous quote that is in the title of my review. When there were riots in the streets, the politicians came and told her to slow down. When Maggie asked them why, they replied because we are going to lose the next elections. And Maggie goes: \\"aha, we worry about job security!\\" Look around you. How many politicians you know that will really run for their ideas regardless of their popularity. That is a leader. There were only three leaders in the second half of the last century: Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. This movie depicts the life of one of them who like Churchill after saving Great Britain from misery, was immediately dismissed by the people who like and prefer instant gratification. (Churchill was good enough to lead Britain to victory during World War II, but was not good enough to lead Great Britain in time of peace according to the British voters at that time. Go figure!)<br /><br />There is a great scene in the movie when Maggie as a patient goes to the doctor and the doctor says: How do you feel Maggie? And then she starts with a great monologue about society that worries more about feelings than people's thoughts. Could that be applied to today's society? Absolutely!<br /><br />Great movie, five stars all around because of the acting, the script, and the director. It shows what a person with real character is. Keep the movie handy and watch it many times. Each time you will find a point of interest that you missed in the previous viewing. Need to find somebody like her and Reagan these days to help deal with the very difficult times.uote that is in the title of my review.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|I don't understand why people gave this movie such a bad rating. but its survival of the fittest out of an unexpected plane crash. this movie still did good for Liam Nelson to lose it all as the actor in the movie and it may not have been the best movie either. but I still like this movie and enjoyed it.

B003Y5H5B0|3.0|This movie had FAR too much language!  I think it actually detracted from the humor and the story of the 2 main characters.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|in this movie Silvester Stallone plays as the toughest cop and Westley Snipes plays the most ruthless criminal and they both get frozen till 36 years later.  If you curse you could get a ticket.  A lot of future fighting.

6304806434|5.0|this is action a real good movie.  in this movie it is like all of the worst convicts all on one plane and later gets hijacked by the convicts.  Nicolas Cage plays as a guy that is almost a free man and then fight against the other convicts.  this is one of Nicolas best film ever.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Beautiful story of a love that cannot be divided.  Happiness is forever and sometimes we just have to learn how to find it.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I purchased this book because the review sounded intriguing. I thought: \\"Hey, a puzzle, sound's cool.\\" What I quickly learned that this book combined several favorites of mine: 80's culture and video games, and the puzzle was so vivid I could almost see it. The atmosphere of this book is really what makes it special and sets it apart from others I have read.<br /><br />However, I cannot justify giving it a 5-star writing. The book is divided into 3 parts, and while I flew through part 1, I found parts 2 and 3 to drag slightly, sometimes giving more detail than I felt was necessary. The story also seems to get a little repetitive towards the end.<br /><br />That being said, there are absolutely unexpected events -- things I never would have predicted. And, particularly throughout part 3, I found myself so attached to the story that there was a palpable increase in my heart rate. It literally had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation.<br /><br />This is, overall, a really fun book that's great for lounging poolside and reading for leisure -- particularly if, like me, you thoroughly enjoy both 80's culture and video games. I would not, however, recommend this for someone who does not like video games.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I can't stop playing Every Single Night and Anything We Want.  I saw Fiona \\"live\\" and her voice is just as impressive.  She seems odd and troubled, and this gets channeled into the music and lyrics.  The result is evocative: You'll hear everything from \\"homemade\\" percussion on glassware and found objects to Native American chanting. Not your standard rock or pop music fare.

0143034901|4.0|I really did like this book, but I also had a few issues with it that keep me from gushing over it as many do. I liked the story, the point of views, the characters, the history and didn't even mind the over the top descriptions so much or the improbabilities. The two main things that irked me where Daniel's language/descriptions of things early on and the recall narratives.<br /><br />A 15yr old kid simply doesn't use those words, nor would anyone remembering back have those details. It just seemed jarring. While I did appreciate the detail given in recall narratives, it was too much, too often, and seems there had to be a more interesting way to get us that information. Perhaps this could have more been a 3 part series call \\"Searching For Carax\\" or some such.<br /><br />Also, I was disappointed (and not believing) that someone so kind and sensitive could so easily lose touch with both his best friend and father. Perhaps explainable, but really didn't fit the mood.<br /><br />Overall it felt more like a day time soap opera than a great novel, but fun just the same.
0425263908|2.0|I decided to give this a go since I read and enjoyed the fifty shades triology (even though I lost my patience with that storyline). I get that it is an erotic tale, and I'm okay with sex scenes, and dirty talk, vulgar wording.. but really they rush into this so fast it just annoys me. How is it that after seeing this woman 3 times, he's suddenly completely taken with her. I can't see how this is remotely a \\"romantic\\" tale. It is LUST, pure Lust.. and that is fine, but that's how it should be advertised. There is no love in this book thus far. And honestly, with the way these two characters are going, I can't see a real \\"love\\" developing in this story. I had the same issue with fifty shades... I'm sooo tired of reading erotic love stories where there is absolutely NO development of feelings between the two main characters. Everything is about lust and attraction... but somehow they fall in love.. it's LIES. I'll finish the book, but I'm struggling with it as a quarter of the way through, I'm continuously getting annoyed with these two... and I'm assuming it will continue throughtout the book. If you want to read a story about two messed up people, a story that is pretty much a blatent ripoff of fifty shades, and one that has no development of romance and love whatsoever, this book is it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I never played Mahjong before trying several on my Kindle Fire. It is not as mind-boggling as I assumed when I saw two people playing it with actual \\"tiles\\" in Starbucks. The virtual games have many levels and an endless variety of formats and backgrounds to choose from. I like the patterns of the Mahjohg Deluxe tiles and find them easier to identify and not as goofy as some other versions. They are probably based on the original Mahjong game.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I loved 'Formation' but I must admit I was totally blown away by this album!  More variety, great catchy song writing, and the inclusion of another classic Testament ballad in 'Cold Embrace' is just epic!  Chuck's singing sounds great!  Sounding just as good if not better at his age is quite impessive!  Sure he can do the aggressive stuff but the guy can sing very melodicly as well and he has a sound all his own.<br /><br />This album is packed with some absolutely amazing riffs and solos by Eric and Alex!  And of course the rhythm section by Greg and Gene is super tight!  Also the production by Andy Sneap is really great here.  I really liked some of his earlier productions from Nevermore's 'Dead Heart' and Blaze's solo albums but lately I have found a lot of his albums to be a little sterile sounding?  Anyway this albums sounds a lot fuller and akin to his earlier works.<br /><br />This was probably my most anticipated album of the year and it has actually exceeded my expectations!  For me it melds the heaviness and melody together in perfect balance.  This just might be my favorite Testament album of all time!  Much respect Testament...........<br /><br />P.S.  Highly recommend the bonus edition with 3 covers including a great version of Powerslave!

B003UN409Q|5.0|a must see for any music fan.  val kilmer is a near look-a-like and has morrison's mannerisms down well.  (that sexy way he walked, the gentleness of his soul, the sweet smile).  but you can't help wishing that jim could have portrayed himself.  his childlike sweetness, expression, looks, pure sex appeal, his tortured psyche--all leant to his shaman-like ability to draw people into his world.  men and women alike knew here was someone special.  as good as kilmer is in this movie, see dick wolf's documentary \\"when you're strange\\". no disrespect to val kilmer,  jim morrison was greater and bigger that any actor could ever hope to capture.  his voice was pure sex that gave an even deeper meaning to his words.  he always said his goal was to get people to listen to his words.  and what words.  he was a poet.  he was a genius.  he was tortured.  must that always mean self destruct?  why?  as johnny depp says at the end of  'strange',  \\"some say he was just another rock star who crashed and burned\\".  \\"but this much is true...you can't burn out if you're not on fire.\\"  what we take from this is what a holocaust he was.  wish he were still here to tell us how he survived his demons....he's not.  but we have his music.  it will inspire generations long after we who survived jim are long gone.

B004X80QNG|3.0|I used it first on Windows mobile, and was happy when it came to Android. The sync worked great in previous versions and I was looking forward to the widget in version 2.<br />The widget is useless, no options (if you use the list view, it will carry over the options for the agenda view for the app), no scroll. There should be a separate option for widgets: for folders you want to show, undated, completed, sort order etc.<br />The app syncs with Google Tasks, but it's cumbersome. Sometimes you have to get into the Android settings and press the sync button before changes are updated both places, and sometimes tasks are duplicated. Make sure that the default PI calendar for new tasks is the same as the one you set up for tasks sync under the Android account and sync settings.

0307730697|5.0|Fearless, by Eric Blehm<br />Saying that this book deeply impacted me seems like hardly enough to cover the range of emotions I experienced while reading it.  This is the true life story of Adam Brown, who was a Navy SEAL operator serving in Afghanistan with the elite DEVGRU team, otherwise known as SEAL Team Six - the group that took out Osama bin Laden.  He was an extraordinary man of faith, love, kindness, courage, compassion, and bravery.  He was a man who gave his all for God, family, his SEAL Team brotherhood, friends, and country. Although I knew how the story would end, I really couldn't bring myself to believe it.  Adam was shot down while on his last team mission in Afghanistan.<br />As he was growing up, Adam wanted nothing more than to be the best that he could be at whatever he did.  When he became a teenager, his goal was to wear his high school's football jersey, even though he was undersized.  With gritty determination, Adam accomplished everything he set his mind to.  After his high school years, Adam fell in with the wrong crowd and soon found himself in a downward spiral of destruction.  His recovery began when he gave his life to Jesus.  He stayed on the road to recovery because of his unshakable faith in God, the love of his wife Kelly, his family, and his newly determined goal - to become the best of the best - a U.S. Navy SEAL.<br />This was my first look into the world of Navy Seals. I was absolutely fascinated.  The applicants are well screened to even get a foot in the door.  The men who do get accepted begin a strenuous, dangerous program of training.  Only a small percentage reaches the next tier.  Adam's goal was to reach the top tier - DEVGRU - Naval Special Warfare Development Group.  The DEVGRU SEALs are \\"one of the United States' premier Special Missions Units, capable of executing top-secret missions anywhere in the world.\\"  Adam pushed on with great courage and determination.  With his unflagging faith in God, he overcame every obstacle - a crushed leg, almost losing all the fingers on one hand, blinded in his right eye which eventually had to be removed, arthritis, back problems, constant pain.  The training never stops.  Once a Seal begins missions, most of his time between missions is spent in more training. That's why they are the best of the best.<br />The author Eric Blehm interviewed ten of the men from SEAL Team SIX.  Seven of those men \\". . . were locked and loaded on a CH-47 helicopter that was approaching a landing zone in Wardak Province when an insurgent-fired rocket-propelled grenade struck the aft rotor blade, causing the CH-47 to crash into a dry creek bed and explode.  Everyone on board was killed:  thirty U.S. forces and seven Afghan soldiers.\\"<br />In disbelief the author said, \\"Never could I have imagined that nearly every SEAL I'd visited with and spoken to about Adam Brown would perish in the single worst loss-of-life incident in Naval Special Warfare history.\\"<br />As he did everything in life, Adam Brown carried out his last mission fearlessly.  He is truly an American Hero.  He is truly an American to be proud of.  My heart is broken for what he and so many others have sacrificed for me.  My heart weeps for the families left behind who also sacrificed for me.

And had whey protein a friend told me to take 2 times a day and that was it I had walked in to the gym and stubled around the contraption side of the gym fumbeling for seat adjustment nobs. Now with this book I have a clear goal the recommended exercises in my jet fit app and so far so good. I have my before photos lined up can't wait to add them and the afters to body space in 3 months... I'll keep you posted
B007RD4KQ8|5.0|Even though some of this is previously released material, it is still worth it for the never released on CD B-sides and, especially, the 2 EXCELLENT new tracks; Holy Water and Out of My Mind. Heck, to me it's worth it for those 2 ALONE. They are proof positive that Gillan and Iommi NEED to work again, ASAP!!! (But I always was a big fan of Born Again anyway so it figures I'd like them!)<br /><br />In fact I'd go as far as saying these 2 songs are among the best things I have heard Gillan do in years. I know I'll get some serious disagreement with that statement, but I honestly like them THAT much!<br /><br />I recommend this double CD to anyone who is a fan of either Gillan or Iommi so it goes without saying that it is a MUST HAVE for those who, like me, are fans of both.<br /><br />And, as Amazon's editorial says, it's for a good cause as well so....what are you waiting for?!?!?!
B005IKZSYA|3.0|\\"Habemus Papam\\" (\\"We Have a Pope\\") is an Italian comedy drama directed by Nanni Moretti (\\"The Son's Room\\"). Michel Piccoli plays Cardinal Melville, who, after being elected Pope, insists that he cannot take the office and flees the conclave. The story may remind you of a William Wyler classic, but the intriguing premise is less effectively used here.<br /><br />The director's bold attempt to portray a pope as a human is a worthy one, but his approach is tame at best. Michel Piccoli is wonderful as Cardinal Melville, but even the veteran player like Piccoli cannot make the character of Cardinal Melville credible, because the unfocused script fails to delve into his personality as deeply as it should. His interactions with people in Rome do not reveal much about the person for which the film is made. The reference to a stage drama (Chekhov ... what else?) is too obvious. After all, we are all actors.<br /><br />Moretti himself plays a psychiatrist, who is called in to talk to the newly elected pope (while other cardinals are watching). The nicely understated comic scene is pretty funny, but his character overstays its welcome and becomes a little annoying when he starts organizing a volleyball tournament for the cardinals. This subplot adds nothing to the film's intriguing theme.<br /><br />I think there is nothing that would offend the viewers. Not one person is described in a negative light. I respect Moretti's decision to tell the story in this way, but maybe he went too far. Despite the interesting idea, the film's narrative lacks the emotion and tension between the characters, most of whom look one-dimensional. How would other cardinals feel and react (when we know through their voiceovers that most of them, like Cardinal Melville, did not want to be elected), for instance? You will not know.<br /><br />This is a big problem with the film because here we see possibilities for a more dramatic storyline, which Moretti seems to ignore. \\"We Have a Pope\\" is most effective when it shows the subtle performances from Michel Piccoli. It is regrettable that they didn't come up with a better story to tell for his character.
055357342X|5.0|Out of the first three books of the series, Storm of Swords is my favorite.<br /><br />I wont give any spoilers but there were times I wanted to cry and others I was cheering out loud. This book really is a bit of an emotional roller coaster but in a way only George R.R. Martin can do. Awesome read. Awesome series. I can't wait to start book four.<br /><br />Valar Morghulis.
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|...and less the presence of Steve Howe and Carl Palmer.<br /><br />This recalls the band's Astra/Alpha days where the material is pop-compressed and presented in unbroken 4/4 time.  The grooves are catchier this time around but nearly all of the hooks in XX are remarkably derivative and familiar to the Asia/Wetton/Downes riff catalog.  As for Steve Howe and Carl Palmer, Steve's solos seem unfocused and uninspired while Palmer's rhythmic commentary is terse and low in the mix.  Asia completists and fans--as well as early 80s pop-rock enthusiasts (Mister Mister, Level 42, Motels, Missing Persons)-will find this new set worth the purchase, however.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Okay, the Short Version:<br /><br />In a nutshell?  Skip the complete set and go for the individual (Blu Ray) sets of Seasons of 1 - 3.  There isn't a huge price savings to be made by buying the complete set, and by sticking with seasons 1 - 3 you can skip the fourth season.  (Okay, I'm biased against Season 4. Not my favorite.  But I'll get to that later.)  The visual quality of all Blu Ray discs is solid - not great, mind you, but solid - and as good or better then the DVD's.<br /><br />The Long Version (In Which I Discuss the Content itself):<br /><br />The first 2 ¼ seasons of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" earned my unreserved attention and respect.  The writing and acting were always solid, at the very least, and often reached the rarified level of great - a minor miracle, considering the show aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.  (Even the smaller parts, parts that on other shows would be anonymous - like the deckhands - were given distinct personalities.)  \\"Battlestar\\" managed to take many of the usual trappings of science fiction and genre fiction (killer robots, spaceships, space battles, square-jawed guys in uniform and \\"babes\\" in red dresses) and balance them with a keen interest in the nature of political systems, military life, and a pragmatic view of what life might really be like after genocide.  Indeed, I've rarely seen a fictional show as interested in politics as \\"Battlestar\\" was in its first 2 ¼ seasons.  And I usually don't like political shows; I think that they have a tendency to become a little too strident and preachy.  (And, regardless of whether I agree with the political points being made or not, I don't like to feel as though I'm being preached to.) But \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" usually managed to avoid this trap.<br /><br />And though shot on the Scifi Channel's budget (which is proportionately small compared to what other channels can shell out), the show's camera and effects work was polished. It routinely looked like a show with a much bigger budget.  The interior shots of the Galactica rarely looked like they were shot on a soundstage, and the space battles were grand, clear, and coherent (despite the use of the shaky cam).<br /><br />The production design and exterior photography were handsome as well.  One particular example: the look of New Caprica in Seasons 2 & 3 - the people and their environs - is exactly right.  Everything looks thoroughly hardscrabble and lived in; oddly enough, making a positive visual comparison to a film like `McCabe & Mrs. Miller' would not be uncalled for here.<br /><br />And, lest I forget, the musical score by Bear McCreary was often much richer than standard TV fare, perfectly underscoring and complementing scenes.<br /><br />Yep.  The first 39 episodes are absolutely fantastic - worthy of five stars. (Again, that's about 2 ¼ seasons worth of episodes.)<br /><br />But somewhere in the midst of Season 3, things seemed to start going sideways.  I'm not quite sure why - perhaps it was because the writers didn't know where to go after the epic `New Caprica' storyline - but the show began to veer too far into melodrama.  Whereas before the personal stories and romantic subplots were balanced by the writers' seeming dedication to unsentimental realism, in later episodes they let the former aspects dominate the latter.  And so, by season four, this once great show had been undone by its own melodrama and mythology.<br /><br />In Season 4, we get Dr. Baltar as a vapid messiah in an underwritten subplot that never really goes anywhere. We get an increasingly overheated and yet curiously static Final Five subplot that made me regret ever wondering about their identities. Characters behave out of character, and the acting has suddenly gone down the drain. And instead of a show that tempers melodrama with a hard spun, pragmatic view of life after genocide, we get a bunch of soapy drama and yelling.  It's this last season and a half that pull the show down from a five star rating.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Grab seasons 1 - 3, and skip Season 4.r />Bottom line?  Grab seasons 1 - 3, and skip Season 4.

0060751967|1.0|I have to write this review just to add another one star rating to try to offset the 5 star ones.  I have to admit I couldn't even get to the point where there was an interesting twist to the story.  The \\"God's blood\\" repeated over and over again by the H drove me absolutely crazy.  There was nothing about the beginning part of this book, that I made it through, to make me be able to continue to read it.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!  Don't waste your money.  I don't know how so many people could have given this book a good review???????

B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you are looking for a shallow read with little substance, then this is your book.  It's a modern day Harlequin novel, with lots of sex...unrealistic mindblowing sex.  I initially thought a man wrote this because the sex was so \\"fabulous\\" every single time, 2 minutes into it, without foreplay.  It's ridiculous.  Who wants to read sex every five pages?  Not me...<br /><br />The story stinks.  This girl has no self confidence.  She is being controlled by some arrogant idiot.  If you're looking to read porn, you might enjoy it.  But I would suggest that you save yourself the time.  It's bad porn at that.  This book belongs in fifty shades of flames in your fireplace.  That's the only way you might enjoy it.

0062119044|3.0|I read the entire book, but I found it rather long and tedious in places. It's well written, but the main character (Kevin) did not ring true to me.  The author got inside the head of her protagonist, (the mother) and this character did come alive.I was unsure about having the ending at the beginning -- it lessened the tension and took away from the story.  Nevertheless I did like the ending she provided.  Others have reviewed this book in depth,so I will conclude my review.

0345803485|2.0|Like a few other reviewers, I decided to give this book a try because of all the hype it's been getting. And it sounded interesting at first. I liked romance novels where the man has some emotional scars and the girl is slightly naïve. The whole BDSM concept is new, but after doing some research on it, it's more than just kinky sex. If all these things are to your liking, but you are a picky reader, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />I know that this story was originally fan fiction, which is fine because some fanfics are well-written and quite enjoyable, but I wish E.L. James would've been just a little more original since she decided to publish her writing. Her two main characters, Ana and Christian, are almost identical to their Twilight counterparts, Edward and Bella. Even their physical descriptions are almost the same, save for Christian's gray eyes instead of gold like Edward's. What may make them different is that Christian is more abusive than Edward, and Ana is far more clumsy and dumb than Bella. James's characters aren't even believable. How many drop-dead gorgeous 26 year old, self-made billionaires, with an unusual amount of free time who can practically do everything, have you heard of? And Ana, the most irritating character in history, how can she not have an email address before Christian forced one on her? In this day and age, I don't see how it's possible to get through college without one. Her inner ramblings are so not that of a college girl (if they were, few girls would ever graduate) and she lets Christian step all over her, just to please him. I think the whole reason he finds her so interesting is because she will say yes to everything. That's NOT a relationship! Not a healthy one! This gives BDSM more of a bad reputation.<br /><br />The descriptions in this story are severely watered down. It's clear that James's knowledge of Washington is limited to what she's learned in Twilight. Even places she has created have terrible descriptions. Rather than painting a picture for readers using colorful and detailed sentences, she just uses a list of adjectives to describe everything. Very boring and blah. The infamous sex scenes themselves are whatever too. Yeah, they're graphic, but they are a bit cheesy, pornwise. The whole flow of things feel forced and rarely goes down smoothly. James's rushes to write her fantasies, so there is very little character development and virtually no plot. Then when she gets to writing them, they are such a letdown because of the bad writing.<br /><br />Going back to my initial beliefs of this book, it had potential, but was written in the worst way possible. If she has no hand in adapting the screenplay for the upcoming film, it may be saved. Then just add a good director, cinematographer, and good actors, the movie may actually be worth watching.<br /><br />The one thing I loved about the book was the cover. The gray tie is provocative, but not in an obvious way. I liked that. The only tasteful thing from it.
0307352145|5.0|this book clearly doesn't need another positive review  but i so enjoyed it and found it very helpful.  i feel like susan cain gave me permission to be myself.  it is required reading for all introverts to better understand their own natures and why we so often feel conflicted around people who are not introverts.  it should also be required reading for the extroverts--if they would shut up long enough to read...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game has a little something for everyone, from challenging puzzle modes to fast-paced arcade type levels. Plays well on a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I've had the app for several weeks now and continue to play it a little each day,  so it's well worth the cost to upgrade from the free version.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|The 1980 Movie has finally come to DVD after a 30 year wait. This is a great fantasy flick that maintains some of the tacky special effects of the original 1930s serial. The cast does a great job and manages not to laugh at some of the silliness. The DVD also has retrospectives from the producer, etc. and a copy of the first Flash Gordon serial.
B0086700CM|3.0|This app is decently designed, graphics aren't bad, but gameplay is pretty repetitive and can get boring fast. Though it changes up your...path each time, you still do little more than run. I recommend it for those who need a decent time waster

It is incredible.<br />It took me a while to see the movie, but I am VERY happy with Scorcese's film.<br />The movie is perfectly cast and the acting is incredible. Dicaprio, Kinglsey, and Ruffalo were spot on.  You'd think they jumped from the pages of the book and onto the screen.<br />Marty did a great job and remained true to the book.  Should have been Best Picture and Actor for Leo.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|to everyone...it's funny, gutsy, and a little bit rude...Moran does write like the 21st century version of her idol, Germaine Greer, and even if I don't agree with all that she said, her attitude and style are refreshing.
B000U6DU92|3.0|Eureka is an interesting show about a guy who gets a job in a place where everyone seems to be a genius. While trying to get adjusted, make amends with his daughter, and getting to know the town, he's also having to deal with some extremely crazy and peculiar circumstances. The story line isn't to bad and it's got a decent feel of something different, minus the fact that the main character is in law enforcement like 90% of all the tv shows out there right now. The biggest place I feel this series falls short on is the acting and it's failed attempts at humor, or making any sense at all at times. I'm not saying stay away from this series, but if I were you, I'd watch the first episode or two before deciding if you want to put time or money into it.

B00006JIA4|5.0|Well, this is not suitable if you don't like rock songs at all!<br /><br />Going to the real review:<br />For me, this was (and still is) my favourite band ever. Did not regret to buy it. Here we got the 3 Collections called The Greatest Hits from Queen (and other names such as Elton John as guest), united as one single boxed set (which by the way I think it's cute). There's a booklet with all the information present on the original separate albums.<br /><br />I know for sure that you've heard any of the songs debuted here (as example, we got We Will Rock You or We Are the Champions, they are present on the last tracks of the first disk)<br /><br />On the first disk (The Greatest Hits - 1981), we got some of the best songs that made Queen known for the world. Bohemian Rhapsody, Another One Bites the Dust, Bicycle Race and We are the Champions are some of the most successful songs they made. You're guaranteed to enjoy these and the other tracks present on this release.<br /><br />There's the second disk (The Greatest Hits II - 1991), where there are some famous songs debuted on movies (Who Wants to Live Forever - [[ASIN:B001JFZ118 Highlander (Director's Cut)]]) and others that, on my personal point of view, are more intense than the ones present on The Greatest Hits. I still can cry when listening to some of the tracks on this disk. I personally recommend this box set just to listen this second disk.<br /><br />The third disk (Queen + Special Guests - The Greatest Hits 3 - 1999) is more a tribute to Freddie Mercury, who died 21 years ago (November 24th, 1991). Freddie was the lead singer of the band, and after his departure from this world, Queen's members separated and gone solo on their own. This Disk is a collection of some Live shows they made. We have Elton John singin' The Show Must Go On together with the remain of the band. We have the colossal song Barcelona, with Montserrat Caball&eacute; on a duet with Mercury, and some other tracks from the first albums of Queen (You Don't Fool Me and Las Palabras de Amor - Hot Space, Princes of the Universe - A Kind of Magic), this is some proof that you won't be wrong when getting a piece of this for yourself.<br /><br />Finally, I deathly recommend this set for ANY Queen fan. And for the non-fans, if you're gonna get this and don't like, you can send this for me, I'll love this! Hahahaha! Totally recommended.<br /><br />We will we will rock you! (claps) and the Show must go ON and ON and ON and ON...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even if I weren't a big fan of dystopian/ post-apocalyptic/ sci-fi I would still love this book. I has great observations on human nature, a fully fleshed out - almost living - world, realistic characters that you easily identify with, and loads of really thrilling writing with brutal twists. The plot arcs are perfectly described and seamless. I wish I could comment more specifically, but giving anything away would be criminal. I can't wait to read the 6th story in the series.
B006UG90RM|5.0|If you are familiar with the song \\"Tatoo\\", don't let it influence your expectations for this album.  That horrible song is not a fair representation of this album.  Unless you have severe dedication or nostalgia regarding classic VH, you will find this to be one of their finest CDs.<br /><br />Roth sounds a bit rough here, and some lyrics are strange and hard to understand, but for once I feel like he has put in the effort to create memorable melodies.  He annoyed me with his yammering in previous albums, only to song one or two word choruses that would hardly be memorable without EVH.  He actually SINGS on this album, and just about every song has a memorable hook.<br /><br />Every song besides Tattoo deserves a place on this album.  I don't foresee many singles, as these songs don't particularly replicate classic VH, but I would take almost any song over much of their classic repertoire.<br /><br />  This album took more time to grow on me than their previous efforts.  But it stays in my CD player much longer than, say, VH1.  That album is a classic, but this one is much easier on the ears and quite a bit more more complex.<br /><br />EVH is in top form as usual, and he warrants buying almost any CD with the name on it.  Best rock album in MANY, many years.
B001KR9AP8|3.0|I hadn't listened to any Beyonc&eacute; since \\"Dangerously In Love,\\" an album that I adored.  So when this one popped up on Amazon for $2.99, I figured it was at least worth a try!  There are some songs that I love, especially \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" but others, I could take or leave.  They're not bad songs, but they just don't have any qualities about them that differentiate them from a lot of other stuff out there - Beyonc&eacute;'s powerful voice isn't enough to carry them through for me.  This is one of those CDs where a few songs will wind up in my playlists but the rest will probably not get much playback from me.<br /><br />Also, while I mostly understood the desire to have two separate \\"discs,\\" it seemed a bit unnecessary, and would have seemed perfectly fine to me as just one album.  Thankfully, since I bought this digitally, it hasn't really posed an issue for me.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|Moneyball is an entertaining enough film about how Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics (one of the poorest teams in baseball), decided to choose players based on their stats rather than scouts' opinions. The scouts are horrified by the players he selects, dismissing them as old or trouble makers or simply not good enough. After several false starts the team starts winning and ends the regular season on a triumphant note.<br /><br />Pitt gives a great performance as Beane and the acting throughout is good. The first problem is that the film is very sluggish to get going and spends so much time setting the scene that when we get to the action, it's uncomfortably close to the end of the film and the viewer feels a tad cramped. I learned after watching the movie that the initial director was fired the day before shooting started, in part because of problems over the script. So a repair job had to be done and the end result isn't bad. The other problem is that the Athletics lost in the post-season and have not won a World Series since. This means the film ends on rather a sour note.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Up until a few weeks ago, I was more familiar with all of the hype surrounding Lana del Rey than I was with her music, so I decided to try to put all of that aside and just listen to the music as music.  I was not disappointed.  I love del Rey's voice, which can range from deep and slightly raspy to lilting and girly, and while I can't relate to all of the songs, I still really enjoy listening to them.  I love the slightly faster songs, particularly \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" and \\"Off to the Races,\\" but songs like \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" do also touch me on a different level.<br /><br />I did not expect that this album would become one of my favorites, but it is now in regular rotation for me.  While del Rey's music will not suit all tastes, it's at least worth a try.  You may find yourself surprised too!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is great, as i was browsing other reviews i saw one that said colors coat real money? Not true, you earn coins in game based on the word difficulty and your partners ability to guess the word, you use those coins to purchase color packs and bombs.<br /><br />How to delete a game: Place your finger over the person whos game you wish to delete or end. Swipe until a red delete button appears where the play button is usually located.<br /><br />Got creepers? Don't start games with random people! start them with family or friends,and tell your kid to do the same.<br /><br />Although the game is repetitive, it is quite fun. For those complaining they got bored: Buy the app! Different words and such.<br /><br />For those experiencing problems, im sorry. But i have never had a single problem with this game, any issue with the game is from the kindle itself, not the app.<br /><br />Lifehack: no accuracy with your drawings? Take a used chips bag, clean it out, and cut out a square,fold over the square onto an unsharpened pencil, secure with a rubber band, and it sometimes works as a stylus.<br /><br />Anyway, all in all this is a great app,even though it is behind on updates. i would reccomend this to anyone.

141690977X|5.0|I don't remember every single rule/ tip in this book. What I do remember is that it basically is common sense. Stuff I remember:<br /><br />~don't ask a guy out first<br />I know on the internet there is a billion guys who will insist that men are so so so shy that they won't ask you out. Those shy, sweet guys who are in love with you but are afraid to ask you out are, in reality, few and far between. Most of the time, a guy who doesn't ask you out is not asking you out because he doesn't like you romantically. The shy sweet guy who is too scared to ask you out despite his deep and unfailing love for you is a man of myths 99% of the time.<br /><br />~Don't date a married man<br />No duh. If a guy is married or has a girlfriend -- this is a recipe for disaster. Just don't even go there. You'll  get hurt and/or cause stupid drama.<br /><br />~Don't date a man who drinks/ does drugs more than you are comfortable with<br />This is another \\"no duh\\" tip. Chances are he is not going to sober up for you.<br /><br />~Don't date a guy who doesn't want to have sex with you<br />I don't exactly agree with this. I am saving sex for marriage and while that sort of attention is flattering, I don't want to be pressured. Instead, it should say \\"don't date a guy who isn't attracted to you\\". If he doesn't act like you are pretty/beautiful then chances are he doesn't like you.<br /><br />~If he doesn't call you, then he isn't into you<br />This is another common sense thing. If he isn't calling you / texting you/ trying to maintain contact with you, then sorry ladies, he doesn't like you. The mythical man who is too shy to text/call you despite his deep and unfailing love for you is not 99.999% of men. 99.999% of men will call you if you have exchanged numbers and he is attracted to you. If he isn't calling you/texting you/ etc after the first couple dates then he either sees you as a booty call or is just not that into you.<br /><br />I don't remember the other things, but this book was just common sense for me.as just common sense for me.
0399536108|1.0|I read the 4 hour work week and really enjoyed the \\"do something different\\" type of message. After that, it seems that a whole lot of people who has not accomplished a whole lot, find out that you can make good money by writing books telling people how they have made it, and that you should do the same.<br />Maybe I'm just getting tired of the same old \\"I wrote a blog and made money\\" story, but there was no specific good advice that I got from this book.

I almost didn't order it because of some of the comments and now I am so glad I did.  I think it's pure COOL!!!<br />I gave it 5 stars as it is what it says it is a MINI bat signal! It's well made, does it's job, comes in a cute little box with bat on it with a cute little book.  I think I will order another for my grandson's bats as he will love it!

B003UESJ9M|1.0|I think I was ovulating by the closing scenes -- one of the most estrogen-soaked movies I've ever seen.  The role of the two lead men in the movie is to fawn over the two women, neither of whom is close to being worthy (for different reasons), although Paltrow has righteous stems and makes good use of short dresses and high heels to show them off.  Tim McGraw, as Paltrow's suffering husband/business manager, proves that as an actor, he can furrow his brow with concern.  Garrett Hedlund, the younger lead male, does an impersonation of Hayes Carll that turns funny, bad-ass Hayes into a wimp.  I'm sure Hayes went out and got drunk after watching this awful flick.<br /><br />Spoiler:  Gwyneth Paltrow kills herself for no reason at the end of the movie, unless it was out of embarrassment.
B000O176Q6|5.0|This is a great release.  I'm glad that I got the 2007 version because it includes one more awesome documentary than the re-packaged 2010 version has.  If you don't own this get it, it's a definite great buy!
B00006LLOG|5.0|I always knew of Lou Reed and heard a handful of his and VU songs. Last year I bought this album and now I own 15 of them. He is pretty much my favorite artist now and it all started with this album. It's one of those albums where every song is great and no wrong can be done. Like Sgt. Pepper, Pet Sounds, Ziggy Stardust, Dark Side of the Moon, Led Zeppelin 4, Blood on the Tracks, Born To Run, London Calling, Purple Rain, Appetite for Destruction, etc. and oh yeah The Velvet Underground and Nico. So if you are just getting into Lou Reed sit back and let the ride begin. He has had many great albums before and since but this is his signature one.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I don't normally write reviews so the reason for this one is to correct what other reviews say...first off u CAN zoom in and out its called pinching ur fingers in and out..come on people really? u still don't know to do this? if u have a tablet that is a basic function to navigate around on it..secondly u only get a 20 second penalty for mindlessly tapping the screen..if ur doing that then why r u even playing these games? the point is to LOOK for the items not randomly poke the screen til u find an object..this game is a pretty good object game..yes it is a rip off of Harry potter but if u like Harry then you will like the story line..the objects are not too difficult to find and it last a few hours...so for $1.49..its worth the money..

1936608898|5.0|This book addresses the psychological aspects of food better than any other book I've read.  The foundations of their arguments of why to eat certain foods (for their nutritional reset the \\"whole30\\") are based on four very simple principles that anyone can understand.  These four principles make the food choices for a nutritional reset very clear, based on the latest scientific research.<br /><br />I've bought ~8 copies of this book for friends and family and the results have been amazing.  I will purchase more in the future.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|Title says it all. Game costs 2 dollars. Fantastic, polished product that is being improved upon on a daily basis.

0061692042|3.0|This highly-praised book by a Pulitzer Prizewinner left me largely indifferent and rather bored. Essentially, it is a simple coming of age story told in a direct and deliberately artless style, but stretched out to over 400 pages, in a novel that has really only two events in its entire length.<br /><br />We learn about those in the first two sentences, already much quoted, and deservedly so, because they could rank among the great openings in literature. \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\" Right there, you have what was the strongest thing in the book for me: the narrative voice of Dell Parsons, a boy of rising fifteen. The declarative style is artfully simple, and although Ford gradually incorporates viewpoints that could not have been known to Dell as a child, he really does an admirable job of juggling the teenager with the older man looking back, without missing a beat.<br /><br />But there is a huge downside. Late in the book, when the balance has largely shifted from direct narration to mature reflection, Dell remarks that the ordinariness of life can be deceptive, \\"since it indicates where many bad events originate: from just an inch away fom the everyday.\\" True, but the everyday is what Ford gives us, sometimes measured out hour by excruciating hour, in sixty-nine short chapters. Despite that arresting introduction, it will take 200 pages to reach the robbery, a curiously anticlimactic climax. And then almost 200 more to reach the murders, which are scarcely more dramatic, though I did find greater interest in the second part as a whole.<br /><br />The first part is the story of the collapse of a family, and consistently disturbing, if not downright depressing. Ex Air Force officer Bev Parsons has settled in Great Falls, Montana, with his wife Neeva and his twin children, Dell and his sister Berner. But the military has not prepared him for what it takes to succeed in civilian life in the late 1950s, and he makes a series of bad choices that lead eventually to his incarceration and that of his wife. Berner takes off, but Dell is smuggled by a kindly neighbor across the border into southwestern Saskatchewan. Whereas in Montana Dell had been immersed in at least the semblance of normal American small-town life, in the second part, the Canada of the title, all pretense of normality has gone. Arthur Remlinger, his nominal guardian, runs a hotel cum casino cum clandestine whorehouse, where Dell is at first employed as a cleaner, though he spends most of his time in the care of a half-Indian of dubious background. As a result, he is forced more into his own devices, and his growing-up really begins.<br /><br />Friends who have recommended to book to me have seen this Canada less as a place than an inner epiphany. I won't deny that Dell comes up with some meaningful insights in the second part of the novel. But here Ford's skill at juggling the two points of view comes back to bite him, for it is impossible to tell whether these are truly changes in Dell's understanding at the time, or merely the wisdom of the older man looking back in wonder. Another problem is that, from beginning to end, Dell is a passenger in his own story. I cannot think of more than a handful of decisions that he makes on his own. In the first part, this did not matter so much, because everything that happens is part of the family dynamic. But the events that emerge out of the past to bring about the manufactured climax of the second part have nothing to do with Dell at all, and the setup for the final showdown is so arbitrary as to beggar belief. So despite Ford's lucid style, I have to rate his novel on my experience of it, which was a three-point-something at best.late 1950s, and he makes a series of bad choices that lead eventually to his incarceration and that of his wife.

B002APU580|1.0|Hollywood does a very good job of cheapening most stories, this one included.  In this rendition, Jane Austen's work is deformed by Hollywood's need for sensuality and melodramatics.  Don't waste two irretrievable hours of your life on this offensive slop.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I absolutely adore this TV show! Is one of the best ones out there. I'm only sorry not to had given it a try before, but I went on a bought the DVD and started watching it and got hooked since the first episode! (I also plan to buy the book)  It really is that good! I won't summarize the plot because most people have already done so. I'll just go ahead and say that this show is a total roller coaster ride! You think you're going up and you find yourself down again back and forth. A lot of twists and turns and nothing is ever what it seems or how you think it is. I just love it so much! Fans of The Vampire Diaries will also love this show because it is as suspenseful and addictive as TVD! Those two are my all time favorite TV shows! Keep up the good work PLL! And watch out because someone is out to get you!!! - A
B0086HGW42|1.0|This was the worst experience I've had in purchasing. I was not and am still not able to listen to this music.I originally bought it for my daughter, I was not aware that it was a digital download. It sits on my computer useless. This was a complete waste of my money and of course I could not get it back. I have not been able to transfer it to her or do anything with it. I would never ever buy music in this fashion again from amazon.
B00151HZME|5.0|Based on reviews that I'd read, I bought M83's \\"Hurry Up We're Dreaming\\" last year and liked it quite a lot. On the strength of that CD, I decided to dip into the band's back catalog and try this album out. Wow! I like this one even better. Compared to the newer album, on this one there are more dance grooves, tunes with more variety, and I think just better songs. A most impressive effort!
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|Hey all,<br /><br />Hate to write a bad review about the product but I'm going to have to.<br /><br />I ordered this headset on June 9th.  It showed up at my house maybe a week later.  And as of August 1st it is broken :(<br /><br />The issue isn't with the head set but with the cord that plugs into it.  After further review of the product and I thought I had done a good amount of checking it is a known problem on this 100 dollar head set that the cord only lasts 1-5 months is what people who have received a replacement cord have said.<br />I'll be contacting Steel Series today about replacement or returning.

0425263908|5.0|Needing a fix after completing all 3 books in the Fifty Shades series, I decided on this book based upon reviews and an Amazon blog. I am very pleased with this book. The plot is not as thick as the Fifty Shades but I enjoyed the book very much & it was an easy read. Be forewarned, the sequel is not due out until October!!<br />Once again it is a book about a very rich, young, handsome man and a young beautiful woman. At least in this book, Eva is not a virgin in every aspect. It makes it a little more relatable. The \\"romance\\" is better than in Fifty Shades but about 2/3 of the way through, you are bored with it also.<br />If you liked Fifty Shades you will like this book also. Gideon Cross gives Christian Grey a run for his money. Looking forward to the sequel (already preordered it!).

B00002DEH3|5.0|This was my favourite version of the Schubert Quartets since it appeared as a box set of LPs. The Melos Quartet have a lovely tone and coming from DGG the sound quality is excellent - smooth and beautifully balanced. All 15 quartets are in this 6 CD set, including the two Quartet Movements in c minor. Each quartet is complete on the respective CD - no work is broken between CDs. Schubert's melodies are so appealing that this would make an excellent introduction to chamber music for those not familiar with the genre.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000UZ4EVG Mendelssohn: String Quartets 1-6]]

B008458O3S|5.0|First of giving this or any app a 1 star rating because your device won't play it makes no sense at all, it is the device that should be getting the 1 star rating.<br /><br />This game is great I have bought it twice now and would happily buy it again if it came out for a third platting. It leads you through 1 simple puzzle each time something new is introduced and the puzzles go from very simple to some that are down right challenging. Very much worth a dollar if you have a decent device that will run it(I am on a rooted nookcolor and it runs perfectly).
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I love it! The purple is the perfect color, the stand functions well, and the elastic strap is nice when wishing to secure your kindle.

0385344228|4.0|What would you do if your teenage son were accused of murder?  The child with whom you've lived day-in and day-out for fourteen years is suddenly accused of murder.  Can you believe it?  Can you fathom it?  DO you believe it?  Now, add to that the fact that you are the Assistant District Attorney for the county and this will likely cost you your job.  Further, add to that the fact that there is a history of violence in your family that includes your great-grandfather, your grandfather, and your father; a history of which you have told nobody in your circle of relationships, not even your wife or your son.  Is evil sometimes a genetic result?<br /><br />This is the story of the Barber family - Adam, Laurie and son Jacob.  One of Jacob's classmates has been stabbed to death in a park on the way to school.  Coincidentally, Jacob recently bought a knife similar to the type that must have killed the young boy, Ben.  Within days, Jacob is arrested and bound over for trial.  The District Attorney finds herself with no choice to put Andy, Jacobs's father, on paid administrative leave until the trial is over and possibly beyond.<br /><br />The character of Jacob is best described by a classmate, \\"Well, it's like there's jocks?  He definitely isn't one of those.  And there's smart kids?  Only he isn't really smart enough to be one of them either.  I mean, he's smart, okay?, but he isn't like that smart ... Like just a regular kid, and nobody knows what to call you - you're nothing, but not in a bad way.  And that's kind of like what Jacob was, you know?  He was just like a regular kid.\\"  Jacob is a smart-aleck, surly and narcisstic, but what 14-year-old boy isn't?  Jacob is perhaps the most believable of the three main characters.  Andy and Laurie seemed a little less well-defined and less credible, but then never having been in their situation, who knows how any of us would act?<br /><br />There is one other suspect, Leonard Patz, the town's pedophile and Andy had begun questioning him when Jacob was arrested, but the DA chose, for reasons unknown to the reader, not to pursue that avenue.<br /><br />I cannot tell you if Jacob committed the murder or not.  I don't believe in spoilers, but more than that, because I'm still asking myself that question.  As it turns out, it really isn't the most important issue by the end of the book.  Have I piqued your curiosity yet?<br /><br />The story made me question myself.  What would I do as the parent of a child accused of murder?  In the words of Andy Barber, \\"I don't think any parent can be completely objective about his kid ...\\" The evidence in this case is not overwhelming, but there IS evidence and Jacob did tell lies, so ...???  I will leave you to form your own opinion.  The book was interesting and thought-provoking, and well worth the time spent reading it.

0375842209|5.0|Author Markus Zusak has nominated Death as his narrator to chronicle the evil and deliberately systemised cruelty that was life under the Nazi's Third Reich.<br />Don't squirm uncomfortably away. If you do, you'll miss one of the warmest and life-affirming reads of your life. The Book Thief will make you smile, laugh with joy and cheer out loud even as you wipe away the tears and burn with rage and shame.<br /><br />For, as just one of the many surprises and challenges to easy assumptions and lazy stereotypes The Book Thief offers, Zusak's Death is a humane, skilful and entertaining story teller. With wry humour, and inexhaustible compassion, Death unfolds for us the life of nine-year old Liesel, the book thief of the title.<br /><br />Of course the story of this young girl, her family and her friends trying to survive in wartime Germany is going to challenge and shatter your faith in human nature. The joy of the The Book Thief is that Liesel, together with her adoptive parents, midnight visitor Max, and best friend Rudi, meet horror with simple acts of humanity that rebuild that faith.<br /><br />These people share what little they have and do what they can to make it more. They value music. Promises. Life. Memory. They are kind. They make mistakes and regret them. They reach out to others in the face of state-sanctioned brutality. As we readers wonder what we would have done in those circumstances, Death's heroes courageously light their candles and face the inevitable consequences as best they know how.<br /><br />The Book Thief strips humanity bare and then shows us what we could and should be made of. It does it with humour and a lightness of touch that will take your breath away.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that The Book Thief is tagged as a Young Adult read. It'd be a shame if that limits its appeal. It could certainly help refocus school students overwhelmed and feeling hopeless after their first encounters with the horrors of the last century in their history syllabus. But young, old, in-between, no human should miss this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an enjoyable app that requires logic. starts out easy and becomes harder as the number of squares increase
0345803485|2.0|This book is absolute garbage. It has no plot whatsoever. The entire book is about the main characters having sex. And the sex isn't even that imaginative, in my opinion (I guess some readers might think otherwise). Everything else is glossed over, plot wise. The side characters are all one-dimensional with barely any backstory. Anastasia is a terribly boring main character. Christian is an unrealistically perfect billionaire, which gets old after a few chapters. By the end of the book, we still have learned nothing about what he does for his work, or any real explanation of his backstory or history with other women. The pacing in this book is horrible. The first 100 pages is Anastasia obsessing over whether Christian is into her or not. After they have sex for the first time, that's all they do for the next 400 pages, with a few paragraphs in between about her graduation and meeting Christian's family. There is absolutely no climax (no pun intended), no rising action/falling action, etc. Not to mention, the writing is horrible. The author uses phrases such as flushing/blushing, lip biting, eye rolling an excessive amount (check out some other reviews for exact numbers). Also, Anastasia's constant references to her \\"subconscious\\" and her \\"inner goddess\\" had me wanting to rip the pages out of the book.<br /><br />I am surprised that this book was even published. It's obvious that it was a Twilight fanfiction, as there are many similarities between this book and Twilight. I've read the Twilight series, and I honestly think that Twilight had more plot than this book. I cringe at the notion that they are going to make a movie out of Fifty Shades of WTF. The author is probably rolling in cash right now from all of the sheep-like readers who somehow claim that this book is amazing. It's not. Don't listen to them and don't waste your money.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|It's hard to believe that Crosby Stills and Nash would have the audacity to put out another live recording of songs that they've put out before as live recordings . It's obvious the Crosby Stills and Nash have no respect for the American public. It's very clear that Crosby Stills and Nash firmly believe that you can sell the American public just about anything. They clearly have not written a decent song in years which explains why they continue over and over and over again to repackage decent songs that they wrote over 30 years  and clearly try to push down the throat of the music buying public. But there are people out there that will spend money on something as wasteful as this,as  if they feel an obligation to support them.<br />Yet when you look around the world there is so much one can do with with one's money that's more meaningful than buying something as wasteful as this.<br />It's clear that Crosby stills and Nash have big egos to maintain and they rely on those around them as well as the music buying public to maintain those big egos. But the question still remains what has success done for them in regards to their lives and  the great songwriting talent that they once had that has now clearly faded away?

0345803485|5.0|I had heard so many comments about this book so I finally had to read it for myself. To say it takes you on a trip to the dark side is definitely an understatement. Not for the faint at heart or those with a delicate disposition. A very fascinating read and totally unexpected ending. I loved it.
0525478817|4.0|Sometimes, after I finish a book, I feel like I should really have liked it more. But something is just off, or one of the characters annoys me too much, or some scene that I think should have been really powerful was lacking. For me, that was the case with The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I thought the idea behind it was really interesting and something not often touched upon in YA. Kids with cancer and how they deal with it, how their loved ones try to cope, how to live when you know your time is limited, and how hard it is to feel normal when there's nothing normal about you. A romance doomed from the start in one way or another, especially since this one was born in a childrens' cancer support group. Hazel was diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer at age 12, and has only lived to age 16 by a medical miracle. She's kept alive through a concoction of oxygen and chemicals, and pretty much only attends this support group to make her parents happy. And I know she has cancer and probably has some sort of right to be as cynical as she is, but she kind of drove me crazy at the beginning of the novel. I didn't like her attitude, and I wasn't really sympathetic to her case. Which kind of makes me feel like a terrible person, but just because you have cancer doesn't really give you a right to be like Hazel.<br /><br />And then there's Augustus Waters. In remission, his outlook on life is so much brighter than Hazel's. And then they end up together, and Hazel becomes a little bit more likeable. Her thoughts become more relateable, and she actually kind of starts to act like a 16 year old. I almost wish parts of the book had been written from Augustus' point of view. It definitely would have been interesting to see what he is actually thinking and to see if he's really as happy as he seems.<br /><br />I really liked the unfinished book that Augustus and Hazel bond over, and how it leaves so much to be imagined by the reader. If I ever read a book like that though, I think I would be just as confused as Hazel. And as much as I hate epilogues most of the time, I feel like an epilogue would have been appropriate. But then the book wouldn't have the same impact, would it? Peter Van Houten, the author of said book, was probably my favorite character. He seems so put together in his correspondence with Hazel and Gus, but he's really a huge mess. And I love how his story relates so well to theirs.<br /><br />The one thing that really bothered me was that when the inevitable happens and one of the characters dies, it's really not at all what I expected. The reactions of the other characters, save for the immediate family, weren't what I thought they should be and I was actually really disappointed. I think maybe it was just too predictable. Which, in a case like that, I guess it kind of is... but still. The whole situation was really predictable. A couple other plot points bothered me too, and although the pacing was alright I felt like it was difficult to measure the passage of time.  Maybe that was intentional. If it was, well done!<br /><br />Overall, I really did enjoy The Fault in Our Stars. I just had a few problems with it, and for that, I give it a 4/5. I would recommend it to someone looking for a serious YA novel about things that really could and do happen. A good story with decent characters, and a love story without a happy ending.that though, I think I would be just as confused as Hazel.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|yeah boy this game is hour and hours of fun entertainment for everyone. I love this game and I suggest it to anyone
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First off, I want to try to give as much of an objective review of this Blu-ray collection featuring all six Star Wars movies.  Then afterwards I will give my own opinion.<br /><br />All 6 Star Wars films (and 3 bonus discs) are included in this set.  As far as picture quality is concerned, it is probably the best I have seen on a disc format so far.  Each film looks great (with a few scenes here and there that appear to have needed a little more work).  The sound quality seems fine, although I do not have a surround sound set up so it is not fair for me to judge that.  The first two bonus discs have approximately 5 hours of materials respectively. (Bonus Disc 1 is for the Prequel Trilogy and Bonus Disc 2 is for the Original Trilogy). The third disc is a collection of extra documentaries and spoofs.  The bonus material does not include all of the previous material that was on the DVD versions.<br /><br />Now I will give my opinion.  After having watched every film, extra feature and everything else in this collection I have to honestly say that many people are being far too critical of this set.  I know many of you don't like the prequel trilogy or the fact that George Lucas has altered the Original Trilogy, but GET OVER IT!!!  The fact is when the original movies were released they did not have CGI technology, otherwise Lucas would have used it to put in more Banthas, Dewbacks or whatever else he wanted.  I personally like all the CGI updates myself.  I don't know why people are always bashing it.  What would probably be a bigger crime to me (and this has happened as of late with many other films) is the fact that many movies are being remade without good reason other than to collect more money (i.e. The Day the Earth Stood Still and Flight of the Phoenix to name a few).<br /><br />I digress.  As for the Prequel Trilogy I loved Revenge of the Sith.  As far as the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are concerned I agree that they could have been different.  However they are what they are.  I would hope that when leaving reviews for a product, that people would describe the product itself rather than just crying about how George Lucas owes them after having spent most of his life working on six blockbuster movies that have brought many hours of entertainment and cultural influences to the world.  They ARE just movies!  I love Star Wars myself, but at the end of the day they are just movies and I'm not going to spend all of my time (with the exception of this review) obsessed with what Lucas has or has not done with these films.<br /><br />For those of you eager to get the original theatrical formats, I'm sure they will be released at some point.  Until then, I will actually recommend this collection to any one who can try to keep an open mind and just remember that it is all fun and games and to NOT take these movies too seriously.  I apologize if I have angered anyone, but I am just being honest.<br /><br />May the Force be with you all!

0767817478|1.0|There's some nuclear tests by the French taking place in the Pacific Ocean, while some iguanas are watching nearby. Flash forward to the present day, a Japanese ship is attacked by something, with one guy surviving and when asked by people what happened he simply said \\"Gojira\\", which translated to Godzilla. An NRC scientist named Nick (Matthew Broderick, \\"Glory\\") studies this and arrives at the conclusion that a giant, radioactive grown lizard is the cause (which is a reasonable conclusion to make, in fact the first one I'd make) and that this lizard could come and attack the U.S.<br /><br />Godzilla does arrive in New York, causing a massive wave of destruction yet somehow a cameraman named Victor (Hank Azaria, \\"The Simpsons\\") is spared despite being right in the path of his foot. From here on its about the military trying to stop Godzilla who continues to cause damage wherever he goes.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't expect a movie with Godzilla to be a well written or decently acted flick, but the dialogue, story and acting is just bad and I mean bad. The action sequences even the initial attack on Manhattan are fairly mundane and not very exciting, the explanation for Godzilla's visit is just laughable and the end sadly left open the chance for a sequel.<br /><br />It was sad to see actors like Jean Reno (\\"The Professional\\") used in this tripe, he is funny but it seems forced to as he's much better than this. The director Roland Emmerich (\\"Independence Day\\", \\"The Patriot\\") really just seems to phone it in on a lot of this and the effort put into the destruction in the action scenes while good initially just seems hollow after a bit.<br /><br />* out of 4 stars.

0547569653|5.0|This was a great read from start to finish that should appeal to most runners. The writing was very engaging and was able to convey the physical and mental strain of ultrarunning. Even though it is written more as an autobiography than an inspirational book, it will no doubt motivate runners to work a little harder and push a little further. Vegans will appreciate Jurek recounting his experiments with food and natural remedies, but this theme does not dominate the book so much that readers primarily interested in running will be disappointed. In reviewing Jurek's race results in the back of the book, there are a number of stories he chose not to include, but the race coverage is still largely satisfying. I do wish he had discussed his races in Europe in more detail though. All in all, this is the best running book I have read in a while and I strongly recommend it to all runners.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I first started to read this book before it became really popular. I truly like the book over all. Some people stated its just about sex but there is a true underline story to it all. A story that has heart and hate. It's about getting over things from your past so you truly can enjoy life today. Yes there are sex scenes. There are scenes that made me cringe just thinking about that happening to me. But I could not put the book down!

0525478817|4.0|I have been warned by so many people about how sad TFiOS is and how I need to have a box of tissues beside me throughout the whole book because I will need it. However what they failed to mention is how humorous, how full of life the characters were. The female protagonist, Hazel Grace has thyroid cancer, she has to carry and is connected to an oxygen tank with her all the time to breath. At the opening of the book you see her depressed and a hermit. Only leaves the house when she is forced to go to the cancer support group. However one day she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters was everything good in a fictional male protagonist. He was funny, spoke his mind, was smart, and loved with no limits. He had osteosarcoma (for those who don't know, that is bone cancer). His right leg was prosthetic but his larger than life personality overshadows his handicap. I really loved both characters whole heartedly. Augustus and Hazel Grace were just two kids struggling through their sickness and finding true love in each other.<br />Some quotes from the book I enjoyed to the point that I labeled them are:<br /><br />\\"I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen. (I didn't tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You're a woman. Now die.) \\" - Hazel Grace<br /><br />\\"What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner.\\" - Augustus Waters<br /><br />I also loved how supportive Hazel Grace's family is. Her dad and mom broke my heart the most. They were so caring, so motherly and fatherly and it was definitely a nice change from the usual dysfunctional family you see in YA books. I am actually a person that cries at any tiny sad thing but surprisingly I didn't cry during TFiOS. I honestly don't know why, but I think it is because I was already prepared for the worst and it being a book about two cancer kids falling in love? it was inevitable that one of them, if not both would die (that is not a spoiler alert!). I think I am just becoming immune to sad novels, I read too many sad books them!<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't enjoy as much was the amount of pages spent on An Imperial Affliction, which was a fiction novel about a girl with cancer that Hazel and then Gus love, and the need for both Gus and Hazel to find out the true ending. I just felt it got a bit draggy, especially when the author of the book turned out to be such a jerk. However other secondary characters like Isaac, whose his humor left me gaping because they mostly revolved around making fun of his own cancer and his 'impeding death'. I would laugh and then catch myself and think \\"How could I laugh at his situation?\\" but I'm guessing that is exactly why any person with a sickness feels disconnected with others, We treat them as if they are fragile flowers, watch every word we say, and stay guarded, but while thinking we are protecting them, we are making them feel as if we are becoming more distant from them. Which is why TFiOS felt more real, because Hazel, Gus, and Isaac all had cancer, so they could speak their minds, joke, and make fun of each other and their sickness without restraint. I believe that was the beauty of the book. The easiness of the characters and the absence of a mouth filter in all the characters! I really recommend this book to all contemporary fans, and if you're scared you're going to cry your eyes out, I say go for it, this book has officially made me a John Green fan.don't know why, but I think it is because I was already prepared for the worst and it being a book about two cancer kids falling in love? it was inevitable that one of them, if not both would die (that is not a spoiler alert!).

The angst, the pushing away, the detachment are all that I saw on the teen I worked with so what Victoria felt was very real in my mind. The story wove between past and present and the characters developed in front of you. It's a wonderful book and delightful time...I loved learning about the language of flowers as part of the adventure.

034552554X|4.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel, \\"The Language of Flowers\\" works, at least for a while.  Unfortunately, when this novel hits its second half, it flounders in a desperate attempt to weave all its loose bits together to keep true to its original pattern--one that underlines the misery and loneliness of a young girl who feels she is unloveable.  The result wilts the overall attempt to introduce a main character and narrator that is forever negatively etched by her experience in the foster care system.  However, Diffenbaugh's ability to create a compelling voice promises to come to better fruition in her next attempt where all the happenstance between two parallel stories--both told by main character Victoria at different ages--does not rely on the author's omnipotent ability to twist the tale at her will rather than just go with what makes sense.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh's focus, most decidedly, is to point out the pitfalls of foster care from a psychological vantage point.  Her viewpoint is backed by her experience as a foster mother--she is depicted in the back of the book with her husband, children and foster children.  Nonetheless, her theme seems nebulous--Victoria is damaged due to the inconsistency of support yet when she is finally placed with the stalwart Elizabeth--a vineyard owner who loves flowers and \\"speaks\\" by using \\" the Victorian language of flowers\\" to represent her feelings which perhaps otherwise she cannot express--she does almost everything in her small power to pull away from affection and literally repel anyone who shows real interest in her. Of course, Elizabeth has holes of her own to fill--a reconciliation with her estranged sister seems paramount in her mind, moodily distracting her from Victoria's very real needs and ultimately causing the child yet another perceived rejection.<br /><br />The reader knows from the start that despite the hope infused by Elizabeth's willingness to include Victoria in her life as her adopted daughter, some awful event fizzles the actualization.  In half of her alternating chapters, Diffenbaugh descriptively illustrates a present day in the life of the barely adult Victoria--eating garbage scraps, digging up flowers from people's gardens and sleeping in the park.  Elizabeth's good food and buttressing attention is gone in an instant and lost for over eight years.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh's cast of characters and her penchant for coincidence borders on modern-day Dickensian where Victoria is Oliver asking for that little bit \\"more\\" even though at nine she isn't doing too badly-- living on a vineyard, being home-schooled, learning about wine and flowers and gorging on food served with love.<br /><br />The older present day Victoria seems to have similar luck.  Her relationship with flower man Grant yields like results--he treats her with a loving interest right from the beginning of their relationship--enjoying her meticulous photography and categorization of flowers like few men would and feeding her sumptuous food that should nourish both her body, mind and soul.<br /><br />She runs, instead of embracing all this freely offered care.  Despite the author's insistence that Victoria is still too hurt and wounded to be truly worthy of love, \\"The Language of Flowers\\" pulls the reader in from the start.  Victoria is instantly knowable as is Grant, Elizabeth and the earthy commonsensible Renata, the florist who gives Victoria her first break and inadvertently reconnects her with her past.<br /><br />Some of the situation are a bit overdone--the painful pages where Victoria nurses her baby until she bleeds is at once a true testament to motherhood but also another sad example of desperation at its worst--where asking for help means arresting a self-induced almost masochistic penance.  Grant's patient and loving response to all of Victoria's almost nonsense could be thought of as unrealistic--but then again, he is also painted with the grey tones of mental illness and isolation eventhough he seems to represent an unshakeable solidity.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Vanessa Diffenbaugh's novel, \\"The Language of Flowers\\" may have some tense moments fraught with too much angst and not enough common sense.  Nevertheless, the voice of this novel croons to the reader the soft secret messages of one girl's soul on its way to permanent healing.  Lovely. Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"though he seems to represent an unshakeable solidity.<br /><br />Bottom line?

This is a story told with an eye for the most minute social and political situations and the actions and reactions to them that cause the world to change.  The story line is compelling and one is able to watch history unfold before one's eyes. He is the best at his genre. I am in such great anticipation of the second book of this trilogy, I've already ordered it to be sent to me from Amazon on its September publication date.

B005LAIGW8|3.0|Crazy, Chaotic, Insane!!!  The first Ghost Rider movie focused on the history and origin of Johnny Blaze and how he became the Ghost Rider.  It also has several blissful scenes of interaction with his love interest Eva Mendez.  The second Ghost Rider movie \\"Spirit of Vengeance\\" focuses on the tortured soul of Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider)and his continuous, agonizing struggle to confine and control the fiery Spirit of Vengeance that transforms him into Ghost Rider.  Nicolas Cage does a great job of playing the schizophrenic Johnny Blaze, who is continually teetering on the brink of exploding with demonic rage and uncontrollable lust for vengeance and destruction.  Lots of special effects and explosions, crazy camera angles and movement, tons of action!  In this film, Ghost Rider has a much darker appearance, with oily black smoke added to his flaming skull, chain weapon and motorcycle.  The result is a darker, more sinister Ghost Rider.  There are no warm, fuzzy scenes in this sequel, only unrelenting doom and darkness!  But this gloomy chaos works well with the fast-paced story.

0765350386|5.0|I was looking for a good fantasy story to read and stumbled upon the goodreads list about the best magic systems out there. I was intrigued that Mistborn was voted so high, ignored the fact that Harry Potter was high in the list (:facepalm:) and read this trilogy.<br /><br />I was amazed, not only did I find a very interesting magic system but I found a compelling and fascinating story based on said magic system, revolving around it. While the second book of the series was a bit of a slow read because it seemed to want to flesh out all characters better through a slower evolving plot, only the last few pages actually living up to the title, reading through all the books was very rewarding in the end.<br /><br />It does have slow moments but ultimately you'll find that every piece of info dropped by the author here and there fits in somewhere and has a purpose that is going to be revealed in the end. I liked that the story is not what it seems, that in the end something else happens than you'd have expected (although the quotes in the last book do give it away a bit while building up to the final reveal nicely).<br /><br />With lots of twists in the story, lovable characters, a splendid magic system in a marvelous world this story is a must read, just make sure not to read anything about the book, I found that every piece of info out there actually gives away a lot of the fun you have when you discover the info yourself.

0062009540|5.0|I have recently just gotten into the Pretty Little Liars TV show on ABC Family. Somehow I managed to watch all 54 episodes in the span of 9 days. The show was just so addicting. Once I was all caught up on the show, I felt like I had nothing else to do (I know, I must sound like a loser...whatever), so I went to my local Barnes and Noble and purchased the first book in the Pretty Little Liars series.<br />  I started reading that night, and just like the show, found I couldn't stop reading it. I finished the book in about 3 hours. It is a very quick read. And it left me wanting more.<br />  The plot of the novel revolves around a group of girls, whose queen bee Ali went missing. The girls have been recieving messages from someone named \\"A\\", and the messages are very threatening and mean. At first, the girls think that it is Ali because they know their deep dark secrets, but then something happens that let them know it is definitely not her...<br />  The book is very similar to the first episode od the TV series, but the characters are described a lot different. It was cool reading the book with these same characters that I have fallen in love with, but they are a lot different. I have heard that the rest of the books in the series are nothing like the show, so it will be a nice treat reading the rest of the series not knowing what will happen.<br />  The book is very well written, with clever chapter titles and witty dialogue. The book is more innapropriate that the series, with some strong language and sexual situations, some involing a teacher and a student. I would recommend this to people ages 14 and above.<br />  I bought the next three books in the series earlier today, and can't wait to start reading them. By the way, I am a straight 15 year old boy, and this was still very entertaining to me, but I know I won't be able to read these books in public without being made fun of, which is a downside of the series, 'cuz the covers are extremely girlish.<br />  Definitely buy this book. You will become entranced in the lives of these four teenage girls, and relate and even feel for them. I am so excited for the rest of the series!!<br /><br />5/5 Stars<br /><br />Read: 7/29/12<br />Review Written: 8/1/12
B0087DFIOU|4.0|It's unfortunate that in recent years you rarely hear Mel Gibson's name mentioned outside of the tabloids. After all, the man has enjoyed a successful acting career for decades and is an Oscar-winning director. This is his \\"third\\" comeback of sorts. He had already stirred up controversy when he returned to the screen for the first time in six years for 2010's Edge of Darkness. More personal controversy followed and his next role was supposed to be his dramatic comeback, but 2011's The Beaver was underwhelming. Now we have Get the Gringo, a crime caper co-written by Gibson himself, which made it into a few theaters but was ultimately treated as a VOD release. Gibson chalks this up to VOD being \\"the future,\\" but the timing is a little suspicious. I bring this up only because this is a prime example of the necessity of setting aside the art from the artist. No matter what occurs in Gibson's personal life, this film is proof that he's still a capable actor and screenwriter with plenty of good work left in him. Get the Gringo isn't exactly an unsung masterpiece, but it's supremely pleasing entertainment.<br /><br />The film opens with two men dressed as clowns in a high-speed police chase along the Mexico border after what appears to be a botched robbery. The driver (Gibson), the gringo of the title, is eventually caught and sent to a Mexican prison that is unlike any prison moviegoers and the character himself have encountered. The driver is a career criminal and he begins wreaking havoc in the prison to make money and stay alive. Inside he befriends a 10-year-old boy (Kevin Hernandez) who knows the ropes and has a rare blood type that the guy in charge of the prison requires for a liver transplant. Gibson also provides a dryly humorous narration of the proceedings.<br /><br />The film is directed by Adrian Grunberg, with a script he co-wrote with Gibson and Stacy Perskie. With a 90-minute running time, the script is very tight and ingeniously plotted. It allows Gibsonto flex his muscles as a writer with a relatively straight-forward comedy/crime-caper, as well as allowing him to remind moviegoers what a talented actor he is.<br /><br />As the highly resourceful and sympathetic tough-guy, Gibson shows he still has a charming screen presence and his performance is gleefully entertaining. There's energy and spark that we haven't seen form him in sometime that seems to indicate he got bit by the acting bug again in a substantial way. He's not going to win awards for this role, but it's a high-energy and very funny performance that is a joy to watch.<br /><br />The film itself is essentially a glorified B-movie, but it's great, fast-moving entertainment. Simultaneously funny with exciting, over-the-top action sequences that move the film along quickly. The only misstep on a technical level is Benoît Debie's cinematography, which is shoddy and murky enough that it recalls straight-to-video fare and cheapens the overall look. With fine supporting appearances by Peter Stormare and Dean Norris (best known as Hank in Breaking Bad), there is nothing remarkable about Get the Gringo but it's breezy, fun entertainment that shows Gibson is ready to be taken seriously again.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
0345803485|1.0|This book was horribly written and not imaginative at all...despite what you might imagine.  The author would do herself good to purchase a thesaurus, as she simply uses the same words over and over and over again.  I literally had to force myself to even finish the book.  I will not be purchasing the other two in the trilogy.  I found many of the characteristics given to the female lead to be simply unbelievable for a 21 year old in the year 2011 (really no computer, cell phone or email?) I also found the male lead to be more creepy than appealing, and his \\"deep seeded issues\\" to be a stretch.  To put it bluntly, don't waste your money, just watch some porn on HBO and have sex with your husband/boyfriend.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|After much pleading, my mother and sister got me to read this series. I am not particularly impressed, although the first book was the best of the three.<br /><br />I must star by saying that romantic fiction is not one of my preferred genres, and this was my first experience with it. That being said, it is somewhat entertaining if you can look at it as a form of entertainment and not, in any way, a realistic depictions of relationships or Ana Steele as a positive role model for women.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: What struck me as most irritating were the number of sex scenes and how unrealistic they were for many reasons. A virgin who can orgasm at will and when Christian tells her to do so. How she has the capacity with no sexual experience to orgasm with no external stimulation. This is very very rare for woman. Also, supposedly the sex scenes were supposed to be juicy, but I found them a little more vanilla than I expected. I had to skip past them many times and without these scenes, the books have little in them in terms of plot points.<br /><br />I found the novels readable, but eye-rollingly exasperating. I think they appeal to women's fantasy that they can find a man and if the woman is the \\"love of his life,\\" she can change a man. Unrealistic. For the most part, the books are fantasy. My major issues are not with Ana, who (overall), I like as a protagonist, but with Christian, who I find incredibly irritating. Besides his good look and money, I feel as though he is not a likeable or redeemable character and I kept hoping (yes, fruitlessly and stupidly, even in book 3) that Ana would realize that she could do better and leave him.<br /><br />My major issues with Ana as a protagonist, mainly stem from the fact that as a 21/22 year old women, she is completely naive to the point of idiocy. Yes, a 21 year old woman can be a virgin, but never having a crush, never having masturbated? I don't buy what James is selling. Even more troubling is the fact that Ana seemsto have an eating disorder, which is not really touched on in the novels. Ana never seems to actually ingest any food, she nibbles a bite here and there and scoots it around on her plate. Having moved forward to a second series in this genre, I have read all three novels in the Crossfire series thus far and I find Eva Tramell to be a much more admirable protag. If i had to recommend one series in this genre, it would be that one.<br /><br />That being said, I don't usually real romance novels, they are not my typical cup of tea, and if you do like romance novels already, you may enjoy these. If you are not generally drawn towards this type of book, you may want to skip. I wish that I had, but even when I did not care all that much for them, once I started the first, I had to follow through to a \\"somewhat logical\\" conclusion, and if you are a reader like me, this might also waste time when you could read something more enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What initially seems like a good marriage gone wrong completely takes a 180 in a spell binding stunner.  I was up until 3:30 am reading it. I never saw what was coming - it was layered with complexity and astounding detail. Not only in the crime, but the mind of the person who created it. Do Not Miss This Book! Literate suspense thriller. If this is a debut novel, I can't wait to see what comes next.

B0087DFIYA|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers, that it was good to see Mel in the talking to himself<br />mode again; just like Payback, which is my favorite Gibson movie, and Get the Gringo is the actor<br />doing the same type of thing for a living a few years down the line.  He actually mentions this previous<br />(Payback) life in this movie.<br />Was fun to watch, even with the constant spanish subtitles driving you crazy; thank God for reverse on<br />my DVD player.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is well thought out; the characters are engaging and well-rounded; and the author clearly has a talent for writing.<br /><br />It's kind of a cross between Harry Potter and The DaVinci Code (without Dan Brown's abysmal writing.)<br /><br />There are witches and daemons, vampires and ghosts, and the odd visit from a historical figure or two. This is the part which reminds me of DaVinci Code; the plot of the story revolves around a bewitched manuscript, Ashmole 782, and the relationship it seems to have with Diana, the protagonist witch.<br /><br />Our protagonist is a historian, and our resident vampire is 1500 years old, so there's much in the way of historical story-telling, which I really enjoyed since I've always loved history. However, these stories - especially when they pop up in the center of some conversation of consequence - can be a bit long and wordy. But they are interesting tales, and the author manages to refrain from giving us page after page of lectures (I'm looking at you, Dan Brown.)<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the story did get a bit Twilight-y for me after crossing the halfway mark. Diana seems to fling her heart at Matthew, the vampire, and never really deals with his more unsavory qualities - i.e. bursts of anger, dismissive tendencies, and vengeful behavior. She doesn't come to terms or accept these qualities so much as she kind of brushes them aside. Perhaps she deals with it more forcefully in Book 2 (which I hope to start tomorrow.)<br /><br />The characters, overall, are quite engaging, and certainly enough to carry into a trilogy. What I like is that both Diana and Matthew are flawed, which is one of the greatest qualities your characters can have. Hopefully, these flaws will be resolved and dealt with throughout the books. It will be interesting to see where they go.<br /><br />All in all, a great first book in a series. It does everything it's meant to, and it's definitely something that would appeal to fantasy fans in general, and the Harry Potter generation in particular.appeal to fantasy fans in general, and the Harry Potter generation in particular.

0312641893|3.0|When I read the sample chapter months ago, I was enthralled with the concept of Cinder. I'm a sucker for retellings of Cinderella, and one that took place in futuristic China seemed too good to pass up. I really, really wanted to love this book, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations in a number of places that I'll touch upon.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say that I really did love the main character. Here we have a snarky, tech-savvy chick who is just as tough as her metal parts. She reminded me of a futuristic Rosie the Riveter, and I loved her for it.<br /><br />I wish I could have loved her prince just as much. Kai is apparently supposed to have the sort of charm and good looks that turns girls to mush on the spot, but I never felt that his supposed charisma translated to the page. Some guys can be endearingly adorkable, but despite Kai's well-meaning nature, he just came across as oblivious, awkward, and unrealistically naive.<br /><br />As for world-building, Meyer creates an interesting \\"lived-in\\" technological world complete with rust, wires, and concrete. Cinder's cyborg implements in particular are fascinating, among them a retina projector that sounded similar to the inside of the Iron Man helmet and a literal \\"hollow leg\\" where Cinder stores her tools and other important items.  The Chinese setting felt very Western, however - but I suppose centuries in the future, who knows what the cultures of the world will be like. There is also a fascinating race of moon colonists who create some problems for the Earthlings.<br /><br />The plot definitely had potential, but I often had a nagging feeling that I was \\"missing something.\\" Just like Cinder's own too-small metal foot, some things just didn't seem to fit as far as the society's reaction to the plague and the cyborgs went. Furthermore, the way information was continuously hidden from characters was frustrating. The number of times that Kai almost discovers that Cinder is a cyborg is agonizing. In addition, a key character knows much of the \\"spoilers\\" for the book, but only seems to impart them to Cinder in a way that keeps pace with the plot. Also irritating is the fact that not much is resolved by the end of the book. Apparently this story will be spread over several sequels.<br /><br />In short: Cinder is a creative and entertaining read that I finished within a summer day. While the plot, prince, and unresolved ending  did frustrate me, I'd still recommend it - but perhaps you should wait until the three planned sequels have also been released.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Something similar: Extras by Scott Westerfeld has a very similar feel. For an evocative fantasy story inspired by Cinderella, try The Amaranth Enchantment by Julie Berry.<br /><br />Cover & Title: Cinder, of course, is a fitting title. Though the cover is not accurate to the book, the classic high heel plus a mechanical leg does capture the feel of the story. But I would have dearly loved an illustration of a tough-looking Cinder in mechanic's garb. Calling all fan artists...<br /><br />Where I got the book: Shelves of the local library.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|The deal was great.....The product came in a timely fashion and the quality of the package was exellent. All around I would say that this was a good buy!
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|This book sucks. I don't understand how it got so popular. The characters are pretty lame so is the plot. The movie was okay but that was just because of the cool special effects. In conclusion this book did not make me jump with excitement when ever I saw an archery range in twenty years no one will remember the hunger games.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|This film is like a tribute to the john carpenter version of the thing. It is a direct prequel to that movie. It's not a terrible movie at all and the main fault I can find with this one is the use of computer effects instead of building monster effects like the first one. I don't see why this is hated by some , it's not a remake in spite of the name. I like the original 1950 version as well and hope for a blu ray release on that one too. The acting is decent and the story is what you would expect from a prequel of the 1982 version.  It is a decent horror sci fi movie and if you have seen the other things you should enjoy this movie. Just don't expect something different. although you do see the spaceships insides in this movie and you didn't in the past versions. It actually has a part in the plot even.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|We weren't expecting to much from this movie, but were pleasantly surprised by the story, the writing, and the acting. It was entertaining for us adults while remaining appropriate for the younger kids.
B006GHA9VQ|2.0|On its own, this is an OK musical.  It isn't something I would stand in line for hours for to get tickets as is its predecessor.  There are some great haunting melodies, but where Phantom was a departure from a \\"typical\\" Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical, Love Never Dies stays right in the center of the mix.<br /><br />I understand why, on paper, having the Phantom go to Coney Island would be an interesting setting, but after watching this, and then going back and watching Phatom, it truly cheapens the entire story and its characters.  I found it predictable and boring.  I think it would have been much more interesting to increase focus on the child, and let the side stories (Meg, her mother, drunken Raoul, and even Christine)take a back seat or even eliminate them.<br /><br />It has moments of promise, but much more let-down and the finale was a mess.  Throughout, there was too much exposition which led to over explaining the obvious.<br /><br />If you are a huge fan of the original, you will be disappointed.  This really is a story that was better left to our imaginations, and untold.<br /><br />Video quality was great, and I thought that this Australian cast would have been MUCH better suited for the 25 Year Anniversary concert.  This Christine sounded like Sarah Brightman, and this Phantom, sounded remarkably close to the mighty Michael Crawford.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Although this album never grabbed hold of the public the way that 'Screaming...' did, I think this is Priest's best effort, and by a considerable margin. And I think the opening track 'Freewheel Burning' is one of the single greatest metal songs ever (I did a wild kind of rock-out-'dance' to this at my wedding with my brother-in-law. One of my fondest memories ever), and in my opinion, has the greatest guitar solo of all time. I'll briefly explain why I feel this way....the solo starts out with a blistering bit of pure solo work and almost sounds out of control, except there is a rhythm and feel to it. Then there's a bridge section to the solo that leads into the incredible twin harmonized guitar attack with both Glenn Tipton and KK Downing playing a melodic but heavy tune. And for me, the solo is almost a metaphor for the way that metal can bring people together. At first, out of control and angry with no way to express one's inner rage, but then it gets focused and the anger finds expression and like minds. Maybe goofy, but that's how I read the solo. And as another review mentioned, this track does something extremely difficult.....it combines speed, power, aggression, melody, with a good hook. Metal at its finest. Other epic tracks include 'The Sentinel'. Wild imagery and another fast metal tune that combines speed, power, and aggression. Then there's the mildly disturbing but still completely bada** sounding 'Love Bites'. Another incredible guitar solo that actually sounds evil. Then there are tracks like 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll', which was this album's attempt to recapture the 'You've Got Another Thing Coming' crowd. For me, it works, I love the opening riff. The only thing that's kind of silly are the lyrics to 'Heavy Duty'....\\"I know you like it hot, love to writhe and sweat!\\". But it kicks so much a** that it can be forgiven. A stunning metal album and Judas Priest's best combination of melody without losing aggression. Five stars.
0345803485|2.0|With my new stream of cash as a surgeon, my wife decided that the exterior of our house needed to be repainted. Our house is battleship gray and we love that color, but we wanted a lighter gray. While searching for paint samples, we came across this book! We were very excited that there was a book with all of these color samples of different shades of gray.<br /><br />Boy were we wrong. Bobcat Golthwaite once said that you cannot judge a book by its cover. Boy was Bob right (and funny in Police Academy). What was the name of the guy that did all of the sounds in Police Acadamey? Man, he sounded like an airport sometimes. Be sure to review the summary of this book before buying. The people are sexing with each other in this book. (yes, like how people makes baby).
B0036TGSIK|3.0|This movie was terrible. I liked Emma Stone in \\"The House Bunny\\" (when she was unknown). In Easy A, I didn't like the personality of her character.<br /><br />The plot circles around Emma Stone's character who tells a lie, and then the lie quickly becomes out of control.<br /><br />Terrible movie. I watched it once and that was enough.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I really loved this book as much as the first. I waited a while to read Speaker because as a mom of 4, Enders Game was a hard pill to swallow with what the children have to go through. I kept seeing my kids faces going through the brutality of battle school and the responsiblities they carried on their shoulders. So I didn't know how much of that would carry over into the next book.<br />Turns out this book is a totally different experience than Enders, but still so great. It stands on it own and pulls you into a world that is fascinating and believable. If you loved E.G., then you simply have to read this to find where Enders journey took him to find his redemption.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I have watched Bones since the beginning and this has to be one of my favorite seasons ever. So much happened in this season! From the gravedigger to the sniper, to Angela's pregnancy. Also, if you have watched since the beginning, the thing you have wanted to happen since the beginning finally happened!!! I love this show! And the finale! There is nothing to say but that it was epic and you will be talking about it for weeks! I know I was. Enjoy!
0345803507|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the series!  When I got to the end of the book, I was really sad because I didn't want it to end.  I grown a liking to Christian at the end of the book, and we understand why he acts the way he does.  The only thing I did not like about the book was that it was repetitive...very repetitive.  Other than that, I really enjoyed all the series of books.  I may just have to read them all a second time :)

8361421475|5.0|This book is consistent in format with the others in MMP's Yellow Series, of which this is the 31st (No. 6131). It is a square bound, 6-1/2\\" x 9\\", 176 page, card cover with color throughout. There is an unbound foldout (more about this later) so if buying secondhand make sure this is included.<br /><br />The book has all the features we've come to expect of these MMP books. There is an informative text detailing the background, design, development, and service history of the aircraft. Although postwar production and service in France are mentioned the focus is exclusively on the prewar and wartime service in Germany and its allies - and enemies. Especially interesting are the competing designs and the prewar appearances at airshows and exhibitions. The follow on Fi 256 also gets some attention. There are also sections with a comprehensive technical description and the various markings carried. The text is ably supplemented with lots of black and white photos, 1/72nd scale plans, and tables.<br /><br />Then there is a section which features full color, up close photos of preserved aircraft supplemented by some contemporary technical literature and some modern drawings commissioned for this book. Lots and lots of details that both modellers and general enthusiasts will appreciate.<br /><br />There are also many color profile drawings which, for the first time in an MMP book, are scattered throughout the book where appropriate instead of being collected at the rear.<br /><br />Finally, there is the unbound foldout which has 1/48th scale drawings on one side and 1/35th (sic!) scale drawings on the other. They are indeed 1/35th scale, I measured. This seems an inexplicable decision but I can't see any way the standard 1/32nd scale drawings could have been made to fit. No doubt the editors figured 1/35th scale was better than none at all. Not being a modeller I can't really say I'm unduly bothered. Modellers, of course, might see things differently. I always had the impression that the Storch was a small aircraft but it needed a big wing liberally adorned with high lift devices to achieve its legendary take off and landing runs. That big wing no doubt gave the editors fits.<br /><br />There are a few other minor glitches. There are sentences repeated in one place and the line drawings labeled Fi 156C-2 are clearly the C-3 subtype.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I especially enjoy books that cover the more neglected types at this one hit that spot nicely.ssion that the Storch was a small aircraft but it needed a big wing liberally adorned with high lift devices to achieve its legendary take off and landing runs.

0385360169|4.0|I have heard about this book for months and there were a lot of good and bad reviews.  I decided not to read it (or listen to the book on CD) because of the bad reviews.  One morning I was watching the news and they were doing a report on possibly making a movie about this book, so I thought to myself, \\"It can't be that bad if they might make a movie out of it.\\"  I then ordered this book on CD.  It took me a couple of weeks to start the book but on the 1st day I was hooked! I had to get passed my views on things and had to keep reminding myself that the female character in this book is young and finally understood her as I got further in the first few chapters.<br /><br />I've been listening to this book on and off for 3 days and I'm just about half way through it.  I am glad I gave it a chance, it is a good story if your an opened minded person and you are not shy about sex.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.

B008JH5CVS|3.0|As I stated in the title of my review I think this movie is worth renting, but I wasn't convinced it was good enough that I'd fork over $20 to buy it later.  I think the idea behind Lockout had potential to make a great movie, but it missed the mark on the character development.  The only person that really had any character development was Snow (Guy Pierce).  While he is the most important character in this movie there was still no emotional connection.  When the good guy gets kicked, we should be cheering for him to get back up, but I don't think we got to know Snow well enough to care.  As for the damsel in distress, she was a little too unappreciative of the 'intersteller' assistance to care about.  She came across more annoying than anything.  The movie was rushed.  At just over 90 minutes long there could have easily been longer.  One example of this would be the fact that we really didn't see any of Snow's journey into space.  One second he was on earth and then 'bam', he was in a space suit attached to some sort of shuttle ready to secretly board the orbiting prison.  There were other moments, but I'll let you find them if you decide to watch it.<br /><br />In summary, watch this movie for the action, guns and the chaos, but don't expect anything epic.

0345803493|4.0|Fifty Shades Darker by E.L. James<br /><br />Rating: 3.5<br /><br />Why?! Oh, Why E.L James did you disappoint me this way?<br /><br />After reading the first book of this trilogy, I was all about it. I raved and recommended this book to everyone I knew. When I picked up Fifty Shades Darker, I was so excited... the first pages of the book were instant gratification, since it explains a little more about Christian's messed up past. But it gets a little repetitive, and the appeal that the first book had, is gone in this one.<br /><br />In this book, there was a change in Christian Grey and so Anastasia developed a \\"new Christian\\" and an \\"old Christian\\" to explain and compare how he was acting. Then she starts missing \\"old Christian\\", yes, the messed up and dominating one. The whole point of the first book was that Ana wanted Christian to be nice to her, have a normal relationship with flowers and vanilla sex and none of the fancy-over-the-top-expensive gifts, no dominant or submissive roles. Then, on this book Christian begins changing and becoming more like the person she wanted him to be; Ana starts missing the \\"old Christian\\", and starts liking the material stuff, starts missing her submissive role. So contradicting! So confusing!<br /><br />I never thought I was going to be writing a bad review about this trilogy, since I had such high hopes. I tried liking this book, but I kept putting it down and not wanting to pick it back up. Although the story of Christian's childhood is really good, I was totally let down by the way this book was all over the place. I might give the third book a try, but not until this bad taste leaves!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It may work for other tablets too, but I installed it on my Kindle Fire.<br />It's nice to have the option of both the built in PDF viewer,  and adobe, but now always choose the adobe reader when the kindle opens a document and asks which viewer to use.  Its a bit slow at resolving text on a zoom in, at least on larger documents, but the easier navigation through the pages makes up for it. Its a vertical scroll method, showing page breaks, instead of the page flip of the built-in viewer.  This faster for a few pages, but it lacks the scroll bar that the kindle built-in viewer  has.<br /><br />I noticed that it supports 'signing ' documents.  But I haven't tried this in the kindle viewer.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Can I just say I absolutely love this book! I have read it 3 times since owning it less than a month. The story line doesn't stop at anyone point, just when you think you know what will happen Jaime McGuire turns you around and makes you think differently. The love story is so endearing and makes you swoon! Once you start you won't want to stop.
B0050KU3IY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I read something borrowed first and was so hooked that I had to buy this straight away to continue the story. Great book about someones journey to realise what is important in life. Darcy's quest to become a better person can inspire us all. Recommend to all.

B00015BIOQ|4.0|My friend told me that when you hear the crickets in the beginning of the first song, you have a great audio installation!<br />So I took this CD to him, put it in his new installation, and he was very happy to hear the crickets!<br /><br />I didn't hear them, so likely my using my ears for more than 40 years, start to give up a little bit.<br />From one point of view, that is a shame, as I will not be able to hear the crickets, where others are able to hear it.<br />On the other site, it will save me a couple of K-$, as I can buy cheaper amplifiers and speakers ;-)<br /><br />So when you want to test your ears or audio installation, this is an interesting CD to use.

0307346617|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. At first I was a little put off by the interview style of the book, but after I sat down with it for a good period of time, I was hooked. I really enjoyed his approach to telling the story...it made the entire premise seem absolutely plausible. My favorite parts of the book were the descriptions of the beginning of the outbreak, and then later, the military approaches to it, and how strategy had to be adjusted for a new kind of enemy (and no, I'm totally not into military stuff, but the writing was that good...it made it completely engrossing).  If you like Zombie stories, and enjoy good (and not overly hyperbolic or overly \\"cinematic\\") writing, I think you'll enjoy this. It's like reading a good, creepy history.

1439102732|3.0|(2.5 stars) Zoe Baxter, a music therapist and her husband, Max, owner of his own small landscaping business, have finally succeed in a pregnancy after several rounds of unsuccessful fertility treatments that have stretched them financially and emotionally drained. When tragedy strikes at Zoe's baby shower, Max shocks Zoe by calling it quits. As a recovering alcoholic, after the divorce, Max hits bottom and sees the light through his brother's pastor and seeks to better himself. His brother Reid and his wife have their own infertility problems, and with their wealth, are considering adoption. Zoe's life takes a turn when she begins a friendship with Vanessa, a school counselor, and to her surprise, ends up falling in love. When Vanessa and Zoe want to start a family, Zoe asks Max for permission to their frozen embryos. Max's new views, with nudging from the Church and his brother leads to an embattled court case. While I found the ethical dilemma interesting, several things stuck out as improbable to me, including the short courtship between Zoe and Max, as well as the two twists at the ending, one of which I could see coming a mile away. This one may be more valuable in a class on medical ethics, along with My Sister's Keeper than as a novel in its own right.
0345803485|4.0|I have read other reviews and agree with the salient points in many, on both sides of the debate.  First off, I am a male in my 60's not living in the US or familiar with the geography, so, the proper location of things never concerned me.  Some of the places sounded familiar (Puget Sound) so I COULD have placed the general area from my atlas, had I so wanted.  I was prompted to buy the kindle editions for the convenience of delivery and because they were cheaper (half price) than the paperbacks in our bookshops and also because of the \\"mommy porn\\" label I wanted to see if it matched up to the \\"daddy porn\\" I am familiar with. (It did Not!)<br /><br />So, what did I love about it?  As flawed and silly as these two main characters were I did feel them growing in my consciousness as if they were real people in my life. (Well, the subconscious doesn't know the difference between a \\"real\\" experience and one vividly imagined). The fact that I wanted to, variously, sit them down and give each of them, in their own turn, a \\"bloody good talking to\\", and to either hug Ana for her courageous stand (at times) or, more often, slap her to break her hypnotic trance that kept her in thrall to this clearly sociopathic man; and to eyeball him to let him know his controlling tactics were neither appreciated nor acceptable and that I would consider shooting him if he didn't get treatment of a far greater impact (preferably electro-shock) than the ineffectual crap he was getting from the good Dr Flynn.  Flynn, also impossibly young and married to another super hot woman was clearly in this for the long haul (i.e. the money).  - Love it? May be a bit strong, but Yes. They were real people - flawed and delusional, but \\"real\\", nonetheless.  I wanted to seek out their family and friends and either warn them of impending doom or offer my help.<br /><br />The dialogues felt authentic and a useful way to progress the story without getting bogged down in third person descriptions. I found \\"Ana's point of view/ flow of consciousness\\"  technique to be a good way to keep me informed of where her 'head' was in the relationship building process. Other (hate it) reviews have slated Ana's thought process as being teen level, immature, inauthentic etc.. Good! I was worried that that was the way young women really thought - not having been in any form of relationship with a twenty-something woman for over forty years. So, from the point of believability, I struggled with her process.<br /><br />I also found this trilogy to be an interesting illustration of the power and control process in relationships and how it affects the woman. Twenty years ago, I was involved with an abuse intervention project as a counsellor/facilitator of the male \\"offenders\\", for a year. These guys were \\"selected\\" by the courts for this \\"treatment\\". Their attitude toward their women was scary, but what dismayed me most was the propensity of the women to go back to them time after time, even though they had been judged in the court to have exceeded all levels of acceptable behaviour.  So, there is a large measure of \\"irrationality\\" in the thinking and actions of an abused woman. She thinks she loves him, because he is so flawed no one else will love him so she commits to him \\"no matter what he does to her - she is the only one who can \\"fix\\" him\\".  Exactly what Ana decides very early on and given her total lack of experience in any form of relationship with a man except her step dad, she has no point of reference for what is \\"normal\\". Although, she quickly gets a taste for the \\"lifestyle\\" and initiates \\"kinky f***ery\\" by doing whatever she knows will trigger the response she wants from him.<br /><br />That's when I gave up - at some point  she became the controller in the relationship and never seemed to want vanilla sex again at all. . . always with cherries and \\"spankles\\"!!  LOL<br /><br />The \\"hate\\" bits were the \\"in your (her) face\\" stalking, checking up and totally intrusive way he forced himself into her life.  And any potential competitor, or doubt Ana may have been having,  out of it.  He justified it by saying he needed to do it to keep her safe, but if it hadn't been for his arrogant, forceful intrusion into her life, she wouldn't have needed to be kept safe - except from him!!!  If he hadn't been so rich he would have had restraining orders plastered on his walls instead of  \\"art\\".<br /><br />Maybe the arrival of children and the \\"normalisation\\" of their sex life by introducing a form of mutual consent was meant to provide the \\"justification\\" for the extreme content at the beginning. i.e. the end justifies the means, but, for me, the implausibility of the whole thing just wrankled too much.  There was some amelioration of my attitude after reading Christian's point of view at the end, but it wasn't enough for me to want to become a friend of the family.<br /><br />My final, disturbing, thought is this  -  \\"that which most annoys one about another person is simply a reflection of the same quality within oneself\\".  Damn!!

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is my second Sound Fly purchased from Amazon. The 1st is awesome but I purchased this one for a second vehicle because it provided the song title and artist on the device screen. My first lacks this feature. I have no problems with interference, engine noise, etc. I've used both devices with the Sansa Clip + but my favorite and easiest thing to do is load each device with a 32GB SD card full of music. Setting the bass & treble on the device and balancing those settings with the car player's bass and treble becomes most enjoyable for a drive most anytime. Maybe if I lived and traveled in a metro area, I may have a different opinion about adjacent frequency interference but there's no such problem in the geographical area I travel. I can't say enough positive things about this device. It flat out just works and works well.
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball is a really interesting read whether you care about baseball or not (I don't). The idea of using data analysis and statistics to develop a baseball strategy might thrill you or sound kinda boring, but the way Michael Lewis presents the story-- with dynamic characters, well-explained concepts, and a fleshed-out history of the events leading to this new approach-- makes the book fascinating.

Phone died and Apple store said it had water in it. I called Lifeproof with my serial numbers at which time the lifeproof customer service representative told me they would gladly replace the case, but the warranty DOES NOT COVER REPLACEMENT OF PHONE.  Apple store employee said they are seeing more and more water damaged iphones in lifeproof cases. This makes this case really no better than other cases on the market.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am probably half way through this book (it's hard to tell on a kindle without a bunch of clicking around) and I love it, mainly because Tyrion and Daenerys are my favourite characters and this book is all about them. It's also full of swear words, violence and bad sex. If you like to see human nature stripped down to it's filthy, animalistic core, set to a background of dragons, knights and lute playing, then this book is for you!
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|The original Swedish-made Michael Nyqvist/Noomi Rapace version BLOWS AWAY this American-made Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara version.  Noomi Rapace is so far superior in the role of Lisbeth compared to Rooney Mara that it's a joke--NO comparison.  It seems like Rooney Mara is some 15-year-old girl playing dress-up and pretending to be Lisbeth in some high-school drama club version of this story.  Mara's supposed Swedish accent is comically bad and her acting is horrendously awful.  She's totally one-note and gives zero depth, emotion or humanity to the Lisbeth character.  Mara's performance made Lisbeth both boring and unlikable.  A terrible casting choice for the remake.  And Nyqvist owns the role of Blomkvist compared to Craig as well, again no comparison.  This American remake is far more plodding and boring, and less intriguing, less suspenseful and less intense than the original Swedish version.  Major, major let down.  Expected a far better remake from the usually outstanding director David Fincher, but Fincher seems to have sleptwalked through the directing of this one.  You can tell his heart just was not in this remake at all.  And the cinematography and editing are subpar as well.  Case in point, there are virtually NO meaningful close-ups of the Lisbeth character (Mara) that last more than a second, the DP and editor keep her at a distance from the viewer so no bond is ever formed between the Lisbeth character and the viewer.  But then again, Mara's acting is so bad and she's so wrong for the role, maybe it's a moot point.  Can't even recommend this poorly done remake as a rental.  Suggest watching the original Swedish version only... As far as the poor packaging, I must echo about a dozen other 1-star reviewers here who pointed out the subpar \\"look\\" of this DVD... it DOES NOT look like a professional quality-made DVD like a trusting buyer would reasonably expect to get, no, it appears to be a blank DVD-R that has apparently been \\"burned\\" on some apparently low-end duplication machine with the title (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) actually hand-written (scribbled) on the DVD-R in black magic marker.  At first I found it confusing that this low-end \\"bootleg\\" quality looking DVD was being sold by a major studio.  I pay for professionally-produced DVDs, not bootleg-level ones.  But now, after investigating the situation online, it appears Sony/Columbia intentionally made the DVD look like a \\"pirated\\"-quality DVD for, well, who knows why...  Because Lisbeth is a hacker... ?  Bad idea.  Bottom line is the DVD looks bad and that bums me out.  I don't care why Sony/Fincher/whoever did it, I want a DVD I buy to look like a professional DVD and not pirated junk.  And on top of the bad looking DVD, the one I bought \\"froze\\" up twice while playing it.  So looks bad and plays bad.  Bottom line: 1 star for the movie and NEGATIVE stars for the look/quality of the DVD.

B004LWZW6K|3.0|\\"It's opening day. I shelled out $100,000 and you want me to close shop because there just might be piranha in the pipe?\\" The town of Lake Victoria is finally starting to get back to normal following a piranha attack. Chet (Koechner) is even opening a new water park. He has everything in order even celebrity David Hasselhoff is coming to help with the opening. After his step-daughter Maddy (Panabaker) expresses her concerns for the safety of the swimmers he blows her off, but history begins to repeat itself. I have to say that I am a huge fan of cheesy sci-fi type movies. The first \\"Piranha\\" I thought was great, lot of cheesy over the top scenes and was very fun to watch. I was actually looking forward to this one. I have to say that I was disappointed. Even though the plot was about the same as the original this one didn't have the same feeling and wasn't as much fun to watch. Yes, this does still have all the blood, boobs and some over the top aspects that you would expect it was just missing the humor that the first one had. This just turned out to be a sequel that was made because the first one actually made money and figured they could just do the same thing again. That doesn't always work. Overall, another sequel that can't compare to the original. I give it a C+.

B00887490Y|3.0|\\"Something had come to cold rock that was taking the children. Something so menacing, so terrifying that the people finally gave it a name.\\" When a nurse and loving mother hears a loud sound in the night coming from her son's room she is horrified to find him missing. She has joined the long list of people in the small town who's children have gone missing. Going in I was expecting this to be a horror movie. The first part of the movie was horror-like. Then a twist happened that made it more disturbing then horrorifying. Be the time the movie ended I was almost disgusted by the twists that I found myself wishing I had never seen it. All that said this is not a bad movie at all but I would compare this to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" more then any type of horror. If you have seen \\"The Lovely Bones\\" then you know what I mean by that. For some reason the latest string of movies are dealing with this idea (this is the third new one I have seen in the last week) and I really hope they stop making movies about this. On the other hand it may bring about more awareness. I don't want to disclose the twist because that will give away the movie but be prepared to be disturbed. Overall, not bad but when you go in expecting horror and end up with this it's like a punch to the gut and I had a hard time trying to be partial. I give it a B-.

B007CKNX28|3.0|I feel as though the people saying intense, absolute statements about this album(that it sucks beyond belief and is somehow \\"hipster\\", don't even know what that means, haha, or, conversely, that it is either really solid or brilliant enough to be a 'must have' or even 'have' record among all of Jack's other work) are kidding themselves, in denial, or perhaps want to defend Jack's (consciously or otherwise) first and only mediocre effort.<br /><br />There are a few good songs that people should definitely grab (title track, Missing Pieces, others), however, this review is about the record on the whole, and not compared to music in general, but contrasted with Jack's work on the whole and perceived efforts (well, lack there of I suppose) to live up to (ideally surpass) his own standards.<br /><br />Never before have I thought of the word \\"rushed\\" when thinking of Jack White, and he recorded Elephant in a month or less if I recall correctly, so its not like time is the issue here. The tracks SOUND rushed and overproduced, as if they were trying to make each track 'listenable' and initially accessible and nothing more. Again, this is quite odd as many of his real \\"rushed\\" tracks (in regards to time recorded/produced not final sound) sound amazing and COMPLETE, as well as risky and (sometimes) raw. Quite confusing.<br /><br />The Billy Joel comparisons might be apt regarding sound, but that's not really a criticism, its an opinion of whether there should have been more guitar or w/e those people are trying to say when they mention Joel. However they are not accurate in any real sense as Joel (used to) try hard to make well crafted songs and records in his piano \\"sound\\". \\"Piano Man\\" or w/e that song is called is well made and pushes itself somewhere even if you don't like where it does. To briefly digress: even \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" seems better crafted/seems more passionate and that song not only sucks a lot (a lot) but I think I read somewhere that he actually didn't try that hard when recording it and hates it now (could be wrong about that, read it years ago). Genre and instrument are not the issues here, Jack proved on Get Behind Me Satan that he doesn't need the guitar at all. Again, its the seeming lack of effort that's lacking.<br /><br />OF COURSE Jack White can make an album that seems solid but its because all we have in this age of horrid rock music to compare it to is stuff like Kings of Leon's newer (post \\"Because of the Times\\") work, Mumford and Sons fake affect and sycophantic, perhaps satanic music (that twists blues and Americana into some British nightmare that would make George Harrison and Clapton weep and embarrassed to be British musicians who play blues or actually, embarrassed to be British at all; those Mumfords get to me...ugh), Maroon 5's pop-rock abominations, Coldplay's post 2006/7 sleeping pill albums, and Muse's masterful \\"we made a concept-album so look at us! we're slightly better than My Chemical Romance at our instruments and little else\\" mediocrity. Those are all my own respective opinions (though really, who's gonna tell me Maroon 5 isn't horrible) I am quite aware, so please don't take offense if you feel differently, my point is, most modern rock music is lacking. I'm sure you all have your own list similar to the one above with other modern rock bands.<br /><br />Blunderbuss is the new white album if I'm comparing this to modern rock/music. When Kanye's last solo album is the \\"best\\" real \\"pop\\" music of the past 5 years or more (I hear \\"Robin\\" is solid too, but I've never heard her), it would be absurd if Blunderbuss didn't destroy the \\"competition\\".<br /><br />As much as I despise (DESPISE, do not take me lightly here) the second Dead Weather album, \\"Sea of Cowards\\", it is VERY interesting music, its thought provoking, risky, and extremely inventive whether one enjoys it or not imo. I hated that album, but was forced to give it a lot of credit overall, I could not deny that they TRIED, and that they tried very hard. It was a solid effort to make enjoyable, fresh, soulful music that Jack and the rest of the band crafted from their hearts and musical souls. For these reasons, I never tell anyone its a bad record or not to check it out, I simply say I didn't think it was amazing.<br /><br />But Jack didn't try on this album, I really don't think he cared that much. HE TELLS US in the liner notes that most of the songs are not recent compositions, that in fact he wrote most of them for a RZA related project (I paraphrase, but something along those lines) and then rearranged them. Why did Jack do this? His formula of creating new songs for a new album (with maybe one or two rehashed tunes) while he creates the album was solid, perhaps that's why this album \\"fails\\" or doesn't sound like a fully crafted record.<br /><br />Please, Jack fans, White Stripes fans, music fans: listen to Elephant, then Get Behind Me Satan. Wait fifteen minutes and then listen to this record (idk, borrow your friend's copy if you are deciding to buy it or not I guess, listen to it somehow if you don't own it).<br /><br />Then tell me anything you said in the four, five, one, and two star reviews is true in any sense. Tell me you enjoy listening to Blunderbuss all the way through as much as either of those records. Tell me Jack tried to make special music that others can not only enjoy, but be enlightened and thrown into euphoria by, and tried as hard as he could. If you can tell me any of those things after that, then maybe I'm missing something, and leave me a comment if you want to, I just doubt anyone can.<br /><br />Overall, my point is that Blunderbuss is:<br /><br />Mediocre. Three stars defined. Please Jack, we paid you, we love you, make your next record one we can be proud of, even if we don't like it.<br /><br />ALSO:<br />Without a doubt, \\"I don't think I'm Shakin\\", by Carol A. Serritelli, from June 9th 2012 is the most accurate review of this album imo. I recommend that you read her impression of the record after reading my review before you buy it, if you intend to pick this one up.

1451627289|5.0|When I first saw it, I thought, \\"Has Stephen King gotten too big to be edited?\\"  Maybe so, but God is in the details.  I was compelled to keep going even though about half way through, I had a lover's quarrel with Mr. King, and vowed I would never read anything he wrote again! I don't know if I was depressed by the violence, situation, or language choices.  Did people really swear that much in the 60's?  Anyway, I had to discover how this turned out, so I kept going.  Stephen and I kissed and made up by the end, and now I need to find non-horror novels he has written, because I may become addicted not only to the story but the style in which he writes.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I've now owned two PX21's for my PS3. What I love about this headset is the clarity of sound, the ease of being able to MUTE an entire COD lobby, and adjust the game sound on the fly. I've never had a voice chat problem and other players do claim that my mic works nearly flawlessly.<br /><br />As for the design of the PX21s buyer beware. As others have noted, there is a weak point on the ear cup swivel that very easily can fracture. I'm 44 and take excellent care of my electronics and imagine my surprise when I went to put on my headset and it snapped...dangling and only held together by the speaker wire. Duct tape to the rescue. I managed to fix the left ear cup...and 4 months later, the right one broke in the EXACT same spot...duct tape helps, but now the headset is not at all comfortable. Now comes my decision time...do I invest in another PX21 knowing there is a design flaw or hold out a couple of more months and buy a different brand with undoubtedly better design and craftsmanship. Sorry turtle beach...you lost a customer.

B007UW9VWO|4.0|What was attractive about \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is that it already has this massively positive reputation. That's one of the more exciting aspects of being a critic; stepping outside of what you know, are familiar with, or expect to enjoy to find great films that weren't even on your radar. The title of the film is pretty straightforward about what to expect from the film. The documentary follows Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi restaurant owner. Jiro's restaurant Sukiyabashi Jiro, is extremely popular, has its fair share of accolades and is extremely well merited, and is known to be one of the best sushi restaurants in Tokyo; sometimes considered the best by a good portion of his customers. You're shown Jiro's undying devotion to his job as he works with his 50-year-old son Yoshikazu, who is expected to take over the restaurant once his father decides to retire.<br /><br />Even after watching the film for its 82-minute duration, Jiro is still kind of a mystery. He is completely devoted to sushi as he's been working with it since he was nine-years-old and never once had the urge to change occupations. His eldest son is practically primed and ready to take over the business, but Jiro just enjoys working too much to actually stop working. Jiro's legacy and never ending goal to perfect his craft is making it nearly impossible for Yoshikazu to follow in his footsteps. Jiro also has a younger son named Takashi who owns his own restaurant that literally mirrors Jiro's restaurant and has a more relaxed feel.<br /><br />There seems like there's so much more to tell surrounding Jiro's life as it only very briefly mentions his wife and other than not getting along with his parents, being kicked out of the house at the age of nine, and giving up smoking, we don't get to hear much else about Jiro's past. Did he just perfect his craft all those years before meeting his wife? Jiro's devotion is extraordinary and you'll want to soak up as much information as you can about him and his restaurant.<br /><br />The film highlights a routine day for Jiro and his constant work cycle. You see how sushi is prepared and the delicate process of how it gets from the market to the customer's plate. You also take several trips to the fish market as Jiro has built a working relationship with masters who specialize in one or two types of fish only (one vendor for tuna, another for shrimp, etc). What makes the entire process so extraordinary is the way it's filmed. The camera work always makes it seem like the sushi is being placed right in front of you. If you admire any type of art, whether it's drawing, painting, sculpting, or whatever, you'll find something special in \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" because sushi is very much an art form.<br /><br />The relatively short length of the film works for it extremely well as it leaves you wanting more without feeling like you've been sitting around watching a movie for hours on end. \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" has a tendency to create these montages of Jiro and his team working and preparing sushi to the tune of classical music. The use of that music is given even more depth when a food writer compares Jiro's sushi serving methods to a concerto. The entire film just has this incredible flow to it that makes it easy to watch.<br /><br />Speaking as someone who works with seafood on a daily basis, \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" adds a completely different aspect to the seafood business. Wanting the absolute best for your customers is one thing, but going out of your way to propose ideas to prevent overfishing is both classy and easy to relate to. Seeing this world that you're probably unfamiliar with is enchanting in a way, but also extremely appetizing. If the wardrobe to Narnia led to a restaurant full of world-class sushi, \\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" would be the exquisitely shot documentary that filmed your journey.<br /><br />Special features include Commentary with Director David Gelb and Editor Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer, nearly 21minutes of Deleted Scenes, a 19 minute Masters featurette that goes into a little more detail with several of the vendors at the fish market that Yoshikazu visits (tuna, shrimp, octopus/halibut, and rice), and a Sushi Gallery.<br /><br />\\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is now available on 1-disc DVD and Blu-ray from Magnolia Pictures. The Blu-ray specs include Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English, English SDH, and Spanish Subtitles, and a 1080P High Definition 16x9 (1.78:1) presentation.minutes of Deleted Scenes, a 19 minute Masters featurette that goes into a little more detail with several of the vendors at the fish market that Yoshikazu visits (tuna, shrimp, octopus/halibut, and rice), and a Sushi Gallery.<br /><br />\\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is now available on 1-disc DVD and Blu-ray from Magnolia Pictures.

B000089RV6|5.0|This is without a doubt the greatest music creation ever made. I'm not just saying that cause its like the 2nd best selling album of all time. I'm saying that because there's a reason for why it's so good. Anybody who doesn't like at least one song from this needs to get their head examined or take music lessons 101. When Bon died, the band thought that was it. Boy were they wrong! Brian Johnson came in as lead singer, and man, i think he's even better than Bon. Here are the songs<br /><br />Hells Bells 5/5 - Awesome way to start a awesome album. Great intro, riff, chrous, solo. this song is dedicated to Bon Scott. The song is about someone dragging someone to hell because it's that person's time.<br /><br />Shoot to Thrill 5/5 - Another terrific song, another popular one of their's. It's another sex song by them. Love the solo and chorus.<br /><br />What Do You Do For Money Honey 5/5 - Love the chorus and solo. LOVE IT! This song is about prostitution.<br /><br />Given the Dog a Bone 5/5 - Great, absolutely filthy song by them. Probably their filthiest. It's about oral sex.<br /><br />Let Me Put My Love Into You 4/5 - Great sex song by them.<br /><br />Back in Black 4/5 - ok ok we all know this one. It's great but i'm only rating it 4/5 because it's so overplayed. This song is also dedicated to Bon Scott.<br /><br />You Shook Me All Night Long 5/5 - Overplayed but a damn good song. Love the riff, chrous, lyrics and solo. It's in a strange way a beautiful song. Of course it's about sex.<br /><br />Have a Drink On Me 5/5 - A great kick ass drinking song.<br /><br />Shake a Leg 5/5 - Absolutely love this song, the riff is awesome and the solo is kick ass. I think it's about an outlaw.<br /><br />Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution 5/5 - Great rock n roll song about how rock and roll will never die and always live on. Great chorus!<br /><br />Well there you have it, if you haven't heard any of these you should be ashamed and buy this now!

B005LAII08|5.0|No spoiler here only praise<br />Pixar does movies in a special way.  No matter what visually technical movie they want to make they hold the animators at bay until the story is just right.  It is why we followed a fish on a journey to find his son, felt for a robot as it discovered love, and had our hearts strung by a cowboy toy who feels tossed aside like yesterday's news.  I have no idea why I ever doubted that Brave would work as well as past Pixar hits, but I admit I expected it to be nothing more than a money grab movie.  One might come to the thought that this movie was only so Disney could have a red headed princess from Scotland to market to little girls.  I walked into the movie thinking that very thing and was knocked out by how much I enjoyed it.  Regardless of the whether or not this movie was green lighted to fit a toy market, the Pixar touch gave it such strength both visually and emotionally I tossed away my prejudious I had on such thoughts.<br /><br />Although there is humor of easy steriotypes in the movie that makes me feel that Disney had a finger or two in the pie the pace of the movie screamed Pixar.  There never seemed to be a conflict in the movie that was thrown in to only shock and grab your attention.  Every scene was purposeful, and seemlessly flowed into the next.  The artwork was beautiful, and I was pulling for the characters through the movie.  The relationships between the mother and daughter was realistic, yet also shows young girls how to be independent yet respectful.  Too often movies and shows have children who start off snotty rebels, and by the end are still snotty heroes.  It's nice to see a movie where they still show a girl who is independent, yet any snotty actions show real consequence.  By the end you can see the real developement of the hero, and want to root for her.  As a parent I loved how the story was enjoyed by the whole family and my girls left the theatre with a real role model to pretend to be.  The music was beautiful, and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme.  It's not going to be Toy Story, but I felt this movie was well worth the ticket price, and will be added movie to the collection.beautiful, and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This is a fun movie.  I really don't understand why it got such bad reviews when it was released.  It was a little slow at the beginning but once it got going it was great.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and the relationships between the characters.  At times Layken could be a little on the irritating side for me, but then she is still in high school even if she is a senior.  With that being said when it was necessary she could also show a lot of maturity.  I enjoyed the relationship between Will their siblings and Layken's mother.  Could not put down this book and went straight to reading the second book, if there is a third book I will definitely be reading it.  One reason I really enjoyed this series is because even though it is a romance book its not filled with a bunch of intimate pornographic type scenes which I really appreciate, just a great love story.

B008133JZG|5.0|I have no right to consider myself a \\"Sherlockian,\\" but during a recent illness I started to track down Holmes' various incarnations on film and television. This BBC series is without a doubt one of the most entertaining of any of the Holmes series, ever. Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome, as snippy and cranky as Jeremy Brett at his best on the older 1980s/90s BBC series and films, many of which I also recommend.<br />The Brits use the word \\"clever\\" very freely, and this word best sums up the BBC's approach to these episodes; all six so far are equally enthralling. The producers have thoroughly thought through how best to \\"modernize\\" Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrat, Irene Adler, and of course Moriarity; they utilize various contemporary London settings and a great deal of contemporary technology. The stories are the finest updating of these now classic, revered stories you will ever see, and I include the two Robert Downey movies, which suffer from a redefinition of Holmes as a mere action hero. This series doesn't stint on action, but it is above all extremely, well, clever.<br />These episodes are packed with a dizzying array of visual and verbal ideas. They are dense, beautiful, and, unfortunately, a bit hard to understand with American ears, which makes the familiar mysteries all the more mysterious at times.<br />If you are a fan of Holmes in any format, don't miss this series. Watch the episodes in the order they were broadcast if you can. We are all breathlessly awaiting Season 3 in whatever format we are \\"allowed\\" to watch, and it looks like amazon, bless their hearts, will be there first, well ahead of the digital competition.<br />(As an aside, be careful to download HD if that's what you want to watch--and you SHOULD want that format. Amazon's download interface is pretty good but the distinction between Standard (yuck) and HD is obscure.The HD version is easy to miss, being at the moment only an add-on to a show's title. As a result I twice downloaded the unwanted Standard versions. Amazon did immediately refund my wrongly downloaded titles (which are cheaper), but I can't stand Standard if HD is available. Why oh why would you NOT watch HD if you have a flatsceen TV purchased after, say, 2005?)the unwanted Standard versions.

B0068LYEHA|5.0|Refreshingly frank, autobiographical primer on feminism in the 21st century.  Laden with pop culture references and hyperbole, this is not at all academic - yet Moran deftly addresses the terribly important, sometimes taboo issues faced by women today.  Having been delighted with the kindle version, I have since purchased two paper copies for friends.
1433502410|2.0|This Bible tries to pack too much into one book.  The print is too small for ease of use and it is definitely a desk Bible, not a hold in your lap book.  It does come with a 'key' to access the online version so you can read it on the computer and zoom the text to make it readable.  I was expecting conservative scholarship that was more historical and even-handed, but I was disappointed to find the commentary on the hot topic of abortion and homosexual subjects to be 'right wing'.  The Bible approaches origin of the soul from a traducian theory without even mentioning the historic creationist view of the origin of the soul. This means this Study Bible takes the view that a human being is present at conception, instead of at ensoulment(google search it).  The Lutherans have a teaching called \\"open questions\\" where such theories are not taught as fact, but Christian opinions can vary and this Study Bible violates that important view.  This Bible also teaches the idea that sexual orientation is changeable, and that is not proved by any evidence at all and we Christians are constantly embarrassed by these sort of male teachers who are caught with their boyfriends.  After checking this Study Bible, I would suggest an alternative: buying two Bible dictionaries; one liberal and one conservative. Then buy a reference Bible with only cross references and a Concordance.  I am not impressed with any modern translation and still prefer the 1901 American Standard Version.  The ASV was translated prior to the hot button issues and it is very enlightening to read the key verses on these topics.  I must say I know of NO so-called Study Bible that is worth the money.  If you are a seeker; after buying the two Bible dictionaries, use the KJV or ASV and go online and check the \\"39 Articles of Religion\\" of the Anglicans, the Westminster Confession of Presbyterians, the 1644 First Baptist Confession of Faith, Luther's Catechism, etc. Those historic documents have Scripture proof texts atached on some web pages and they are well worth the study. I have good fortune with my Amazon purchases, but this one is a big disappointment, not the service, but the product purchased. I would not recommend this Study Bible.  BUT, whatever your choice, read/study God's word, that is his message to us.

0345803485|5.0|This book is not a writing masterpiece by any means, but it is 100% entertaining.  They are an easy read, but I overlooked the poor writing and was able to enjoy all three books.
0345803485|1.0|I got caught up in the hype and quickly bought the series on my kindle.  Wish I had read these reviews first.  I'm trying but it's painful to try and even finish the first book.  Were it not for the adult sexual situations, the main character reads like a 16 year old girl.  I'm almost half way through and there seems to be no plot line other than \\"Does Christian really, really like Anastasia or is he just using her for her body?\\"  And there are no real twists and turns in that plot line, just more and more self-doubt from a main character that is not remotely appealing and downright annoying.

B005S9ELB2|3.0|This is the latest Step Up movie and it has taken a whole new showcase for dancing talent. There are no more school performances. No more battles. No more dance competition?!?! What do we have now? We have flash mobs!!! (A group of people dancing at random places and times.)<br /><br />The main story is the same as the last 3 movies - boy meets girl and falls in love. And that's fine, that's what Step Up is with dancing. I felt that they needed to build up the characters even more for people to really care about them. The love interest wasn't that interesting to me. At the end, I didn't care if the guy and girl got back together either way. They needed to show the people why they really needed to be together. All we saw was that they like to flirt around with each other. They like dancing with each other. They both are into The Mob. But...does that really mean they needed to be together? I said, not really. I see attraction. I see lust. And, even affection. But, I don't see love.  So, they needed to develop the characters even more and replace it with less dancing.<br /><br />I thought the dancing was great at first, but after watching it about 3/4 of the movie, I realized there are way too much dancing! It's so repetitive! Since there's no dance competition in the movie, I just saw the same dancers over and over again. Sure, they are dancing different songs, doing different moves, and have different themes, but it still fails to keep my interest. Too much can be a bad thing too and this is an example of too much dancing! Even during the movie, they said it themselves, \\"the only way they know how to expressed ourselves is withhhhhh...dancing! All I thought was \\"OMG, NOT AGAIN!\\" \\"Oh HELL NO!\\" \\"Here we go again.\\"<br /><br />Again, they should really develop the characters more. Why should I give a damn, if I don't really know much about them? Oh, just because the movie said show me a bit of something, doesn't mean I'm going to really go along with that idea. I don't think so!!!<br /><br />The music. They really could had used better music. I only liked the first and last few songs. The rest of the songs, I didn't care for.<br /><br />You don't need to watch this movie in 3D. This movie is fine in 2D because it's just not that good. The 3D effects just is an extra additional part, but won't make it any better than previous Step Ups.<br /><br />In this Step Up movie, they do like they always do by trying to connect the last Step Up movie somehow. This was done by having Twiitch in the movie and a few other dancers did a cameo from the last movies. I believe they should not have done it this way and actually used one or two more previous dancers and make a movie with them in it. Maybe the previous dancers all could had build up a story where they wanted to now do Flash mobs and that's how come we are now seeing this new direction, but nooo it's not like that. We just got introduced to a few new faces that I just didn't connect with and hated them.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong. I love Step Up movies! The first three movies were amazing great! And still, my favorite Step Up movie is the 3rd movie! That one was so well done with all the characters, story line, music, and dancing. Maybe it was so well done that every Step Up movie that will follow it will always do bad because they can never match up to greatest. Yet, another reason why, this 4th movie wasn't as good.<br /><br />Final thoughts, I think people should save their money. This movie is only worth renting. It's a must see for sure for any Step Up movie fan, but it's NOT a must buy.

Brolin does a awesome job and brings a new life to Agent K character. Will Smith is as funny as ever and makes his character's Agent J great. The story is what really makes this movie good. The special effects are there and are used to just helps the story. It answers some questions from the previous movies that people wondered about. I really loved the ending. It was kind of sad, but great at the same time. This movie is well done and worth a buy for some.

0345803485|4.0|I have to admit, I contemplated over whether or not to start reading this trilogy for about a month. A couple of friends and co-workers informed me about the book and they said that they liked it. The plot that was described to me did not intrigue me in the slightest. An entire book about two people having sex? Uh.. no thanks, I'll stick to my dystopian novels. It was not until I started noticing how popular this book was becoming that I decided to start reading some reviews. I literally had to search through countless 'one-star, this sucks,' reviews on amazon until I finally found one that said the book was worth reading, so I dismissed the thought of giving it a try. Weeks later, more and more of my close friends were telling me how great this book was and that I had to read it. So on one rainy day, I bought it on my Kindle and had it finished 72 hours later.<br /><br />I was very surprised at my reaction to this book. It was more than just positive. I loved it.<br /><br />After becoming so attached to The Hunger Games trilogy I was afraid that I was not going to be able to find another series that I enjoyed. Now that I am midway through the third book of Fifty Shades, I can say that The Hunger Game still triumphs, but I am not disappointed.<br /><br />There are some major flaws in this book however. If you are looking for a literary masterpiece than you might as well move on. I have caught multiple grammar errors throughout the books, and James tends to repeat herself... a lot. The main female character, Ana, tends to bite her lip about every other page of every book. All in all, is this book going to go down on the top ten best pieces of literature list? Hell no. But is it an enjoyable and addicting read? Hell yes.<br /><br />I do understand why some people may not like this series. It is somewhat poorly written, it could be a lot better if James maybe would have spent a little more money on the editor that she hired, whoever that is. Its dirty, kinky, and very sexual; butt plugs, whips, handcuffs and much more are used throughout. There is alot of blushing, lip biting, and describing the continuously ever-changing color and mood of Christain Grey's eyeballs. But there is an intriguing story that goes along with all of the flaws, which is what kept me reading.<br /><br />My overall advise when it comes to Fifty Shades of Grey is to try it out and read it for yourself before you completely dismiss it. It is a New York Times best seller and a Kindle best seller for a reason, some people obviously like it, so who is to say that you can't be one of them? Take it from someone who was the biggest skeptic and ended up loving the series.sexual; butt plugs, whips, handcuffs and much more are used throughout.

First of all WHO believes there is an attractive 21/22 year old woman out there who has never so much as been kissed much less had sex? I found that so hard to believe that it made these supposedly sizzling \\"love\\" scenes ridiculous for me. I couldn't even finish it and that is rare for me, only ever happened maybe twice before and I've been reading books for 35 years now, since I was 10. So basically if you like well written stories, even if you like your smut well written? Stay away from this book!!

B007XNAPNY|5.0|I've been a Duranie since way back in the early 80z and for me, that love of this band and the music has never waned...and actually has grown over all these years. I now share an appreciation for the music with my 14 year old son who also thought this dvd was really good! I was a bit disappointed in the choice of songs but then I got over it 'cos really, HOW many times do I have to hear and see Simon Lebon sing Save A Prayer, even if it is my favourite song? It was great to sit and watch with a glass (or three) of wine and it got me even more excited for the show I'm going to in a couple of weeks! YAY DURAN DURAN!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am the type of girl who always springs for very girly books. Emily Giffin, and I also have been going through an Amish Fiction phase (what?). I have to say I loved this book! There is a lot of focus on character development. I loved that the characters knew more than the reader. All together really enjoyed!
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Completely unwatchable piece of trash. The effects were laughable and the acting and dialogue were even worse. Historically, well, it's clear no one who made this film cares a wit about being historically correct, only politically correct. Just think \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menance\\" set during World War Two.
B005BHNCO8|4.0|This really is a decent build and I cannot ask for more as someone who is beginning to use a light setup. These are not sturdy enough for an outdoor environment for what ever purpose, but they are excellent for indoors.<br /><br />In short I can see good quality and I have all the time in the world to set them up or bring em down. If it were for my camera tripod for example.. I would consider them only as a second choice as the clamps are all screw based unlike a push pull setup.<br /><br />Also, One might want to verify the size of the umbrellas.. These are not the large umbrellas. I just received them today and could not verify the exact size

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a good game. I was bored so I bought it thinking I'll play this for five minutes then delete it, but it's actually fun.
B002B0FLOM|5.0|Neil Young is a long time favorite of mine.  His albums are easy go-to picks when I need to put something on and don't want to spend a long time choosing.<br /><br />Comes a Time is easily my favorite of his.  I love his rough and messed up electric albums, but I love the easy acoustic feel of this one.  Adding Nicolette Larson on vocals really sets this album aside from his other work.  She adds a great touch.<br /><br />One sign of what a great album this is, is when I have my library set on shuffle and one of these tracks comes up (especially Look Out For My Love), I have to turn off the shuffle and set it to play the whole album from start to finish.<br /><br />The other sign of how awesome this album is, is that you can't help but sing along to most of it.  It's a great album for driving at night, because you keep yourself awake singing every track (no matter how bad your voice is).<br /><br />This album is evidence of how amazing the early 70s were.  We all focus on the stupid parts of the 70s, but this album goes to show just how much great art was being produced in those days.  Shame on you, 90s!  :)<br /><br />Good stuff.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A superb read, hard to put down, and what incredible value.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and I love how the books lull you into assuming the obvious righteousness and truth of the \\"good guys\\" and the obvious evil of the \\"bad guys\\". Then, you quickly start seeing the subtleties between the black and white. You realize your first self-righteous outrage is as misplaced and naive as the protagonist realizes the same.<br /><br />The subtlety of the story and how it ties together the great arcs of human history through characters is splendid. I bought all his other books and I'm starting to read them now.
0345803485|1.0|I fear for teenage girls under pressure from their boyfriends.  This book is insulting to women and takes us back centuries when women were bullied & tortured and had no self respect. Women have spent the last 30 years proving they're the superior sex, only now to be subjected to pressure by the media to get back in line and do as we're told.  This book is demeaning and before we know it we'll all be wearing veils or bugars.  Men want to be superior again and that's why this book's been distributed by men at £3. No wonder everyone's buying it for £3 who wouldn't, you can read it and throw it away at that price.  If it was the price of other books no-one would bother with it.  Unfortunately women love to be in the fashion and its become fashionable to have read this book and have a titter.  I doubt any real woman would allow herself to be subjected to this kind of barbaric torture and I hope will not be bullied into it by some drunken slob. Come on girls wake up and smell the coffee !!  We're better than that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games are ok.  most games really are just a way to pass time and they are quick so good for little kids to play while waiting.  controls are not always super accurate but my kids still like it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded the game to my kindle fire and I love it cant put it down. Fun app. Don't over think how to connect to the dots.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Since I had the kindle fire, I had tried to view PDF's which had in-built annotations and hyperlinks. This app views it normally. The native kindle PDF app does not do anything. These PDF's were personally created and were stored on the device. Connected the fire via a usb to the computer and copied the pdf's to the documents folder.<br /><br />Kindle fire support folks asked me to download Adobe Reader app, but that did not work either to view the hyperlinks stored in the PDF's. This app works like a charm. Definitely the best 1.99 I have spent.
B00003CXSM|3.0|It was a fun movie - definitely not deep and not a great plot but nevertheless it's light and fun and you can even grasp the whole thing with 60% attention!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I originally bought this for my grandsons---but now I can 't put it down. Besides I love having the little animals wave at me!!! The bonuses are extremely generous and I do let my grandsons play the Scratt game (begrudgingly).  I HIGHLY recommend this &quot;game&quot; (passtime)!)
B007ORV092|5.0|I watched Seasons 1-4 on Blu-ray, and the first two episodes of season 5 on Amazon video, and the HD video was definitely every much as fine as the Blu-ray. Transferring the purchase to the TiVo unit at first took a long time, but we soon determined that this was because the TiVo was also recording some TiVo suggestions programs. When we stopped those recordings, the transfer suddenly was much quicker. Still, you'll want to allow some time from purchase to when you want to start watching. This isn't quite on-demand.<br /><br />The Season 5 starts off strong, with all our regular characters from Season 4. The themes again are more about the new business and Don's personal life. The earlier themes of the misery, alienation, cheating, resentments of suburban middle class life are thankfully attenuated. Then again, you never quite know what to expect in this show, which is one of its charms. It's great to see the show back with season 5 without losing a step or feeling like the writers were all replaced or got bored with the concept and decided to reinvent it so they would be more entertained.<br /><br />Mad Men is my latest television pleasure. A great show! If you haven't been watching it, do yourself a favor and start from the beginning. It's not your ordinary TV show. More like a movie in 65 parts (and counting).
B007V2UGPE|5.0|everything great. free game is good and this game works very well. I love freegames that are good. happy with new game.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Since Ah-Nold has recently returned to his acting career, it seems very appropriate to review the movie that made his career in the first place.<br /><br />Watching The Terminator (1984) today makes me realize how much the action genre has fallen. Call me a nostalgic but I loan for the days when action movies were intelligently crafted, fun to watch and even easy to follow, the movies of John McTiernan, Walter Hill, Don Siegel and James Cameron. Nowadays, it's nothing but explosions, explosions, explosions. Even worse is that all these movies are shot with rapid cuts and quick edits, disrupting the visual flow and causing more headache and confusion than pleasure and insight. To be fair, there are some directors in that genre that try (Christopher Nolan, Paul Greengrass, Guillermo Del Toro, just to name a few) but honestly, watching today's action movies is a complete eyesore.<br /><br />That's why watching The Terminator for the first time in five years is a breath of fresh air. Even its simple premise is a welcome relief after the overly labored plots of today's movies: in 2029, in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, machines have overrun the planet and are engaged in a war against the few surviving members of the human race. To ensure victory over the humans, the machines send a terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will give birth to future human resistance leader John Connor. To thwart their plans, the human resistance sends in one of their own soldiers, Kyle Reese, (Michael Biehn) to protect Connor and stop the terminator.<br /><br />By a lesser director's hands, The Terminator could have come off as a kind of amateurish, low-budget schlock that would have impressed Roger Corman. But through James Cameron's skillful direction, this potential candidate for Z-grade turkey of 1984  was transformed into a stunningly well-conceived action thriller that transcended its minimal budget. The Terminator is a masterwork of action film storytelling, shot and edited to achieve a relentless pace but never at the expense of the human element. For example, in a clever use of exposition, Cameron has Biehn tell Hamilton what is going on in the midst of a car chase. Even though it's 108 minutes, The Terminator finds the perfect balance of great action and human drama, using special effects for the sake of storytelling instead of the other way around. By comparison, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), which ran two and a half hours, boasted stunning visuals but featured thin characterization and a muddled plot.<br /><br />Cameron is a pro when it comes to action and indeed there is a gallery of such set pieces like the police station shoot out and the climatic highway chase scene. But the movie is also rich with character development, particularly the relationship between Hamilton and Biehn, which forms the emotional core of the movie. Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor, who throughout the movie undergoes a transformation from a sweet, confused innocent to a strong-willed female warrior, a recurring theme in James Cameron's work, from Aliens (1986) to Avatar (2009). Hamilton makes Connor's transformation believable as she starts out as a carefree waitress to victim on the run and eventually fighter against the terminator. Biehn is terrific as Reese, whose battles against the machines in the future have drained him of so much pain and feeling.<br /><br />But, of course, the real star of the picture is Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator. Schwarzenegger's terminator ranks as one of the most menacing villains in all of movies, persistent, unreasonable, remorseless and completely devoid of feeling. This is Schwarzenegger's best performance, in which he uses his limitations as an actor to make the character come to life and even add doses of black humor. Some of my favorite scenes in The Terminator are the ones where Schwarzenegger isn't committing mass slaughter but when he's hunting for Sarah and Reese, rather he's in the parking lot, his eyes moving back and forth like a surveillance camera; mimicking Connor's relatives to locate his prey; or giving a caustic reply to a guy complaining about a \\"dead cat\\". It's subtle moments like these which make The Terminator a breed apart from action movies today and it would be nice if today's action movies could add some subtlety, alongside their bombastic explosions, as well.<br /><br />The Terminator deservedly became a box-office hit in 1984 and launched the careers of director James Cameron and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cameron would return to the Terminator seven years later with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which had greater action scenes, more sophisticated special effects and shot with a considerably bigger budget. I love T2 (which is on my list of 100 favorite movies of all time) but the tough, gritty nature and nihilism of T1 somehow feels fresher. The ending where Sarah Connor drives off to the desert with a severe thunderstorm lurking, knowing what is in store for humanity's future, feels more emotionally resonant than the T-800's descent to the molten steel in T2.<br /><br />The Terminator (1984) remains one of the best action movies ever made and a necessary tonic to today's soulless headbangers. Indeed, we need action movies like The Terminator today to show that there is more to the genre than pyrotechnics and fast cuts. Thankfully, the rise of DVD and Blu-Ray has made it possible for moviegoers to venture through movie history and make startling discoveries. The Terminator is definitely one of those great discoveries, especially for anyone who loves the medium of movies and action movies in general.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.ing for Sarah and Reese, rather he's in the parking lot, his eyes moving back and forth like a surveillance camera; mimicking Connor's relatives to locate his prey; or giving a caustic reply to a guy complaining about a \\"dead cat\\".

B0074MZSWW|5.0|Gotta rep. the Shakes. That mixture of that classic Soul structure and those Kurt Cobain yells kill me. I  got this album the day it came out (had tix just to check them out @ Bowery Ball Room) and yo, i still spin this record several times a week. Stop frontin on yourself and recognize, this is prolly the best new band in the past 10 years. There is always something to pick at but if you can recognize dope music, sincere lyrics, and a f*n tight band... you best recognize Alabama Shakes. This is my favorite album of the year so far. (period)<br />P.S.<br />also check out Nas - Life is Good. #2 album of the year so far.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie came in early, Just like i bought it from the store works great. Very pleased with the movie.
B0075PYG1M|4.0|This album was sooo sick! But I just got mad tired of it after a month or 2. Its sick mood music (especially that Soulchild colab.) but i couldn't play it out like i did alot of other albums out this year (like Nas- The Good Life), jazz albums included... Monk's Moods could play on repeat, everywhere, for the rest of my life, and i'd be like... dope. But \\"Freaky black track you never play me...\\" is TRUTH, but honestly best when its a surprise on shuffle or your tryin to look dope to your friends. All in all, I love this album and MAD props to Glasper, but on the real... it ain't no 5 outta 5.

B0085BHHOS|5.0|Perfect for any die-hard Britney fan like myself. I love every song and I think these must have been the ones that Britney is most proud of from her career.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of each individual song:<br />1. Oops! I Did It Again - 5/5 - Classic. Flawless vocals, beautiful tune, everything about it is just amazing and takes me back to 2000 (:<br />2. Baby One More Time - 5/5 - Perfect classic, the start of Britney's career, the tune that created a legend.<br />3. Slave 4 U - 5/5 - This is one of my top 3 favorite songs of all time, and I have 1,054 songs on itunes. Legendary song, incredibly sophisticated but still innocent.<br />4. Born To Make You Happy - 5/5 - Although there was a lot of controversy about this song at first, I think it's really pretty but still fun at the same time.<br />5. Cinderella - 4/5 - Really fun song, makes you want to dance with her fierce but delicate vocals.<br />6. Brave New Girl - 3/5 - Not sure I care for the actual lyrics or meaning, but I'm in love with the fun beat.<br />7. The Hook Up - 5/5 - A song that really makes you want to dance, it's very confectious!!<br />8. Don't Hang Up - 5/5 - This was a bonus track on the Australian release of In The Zone, and I've always loved it! Really pretty & amazing.<br />9. One Kiss From You - 4/5 - I love this song! It's so pretty but fun at the same time! All of britney's songs are amazing.<br />10. Anticipating - 4/5 - I love this song, it's just you can't listen to it too many times or it starts to be fairly annoying.<br />11. What it's Like To Be Me - 5/5 - An amazing fierce song that is so danceable.<br />12. My Baby - 4/5 - I don't understand why this gets so much hate. Cowritten by britney herself, it's so gorgeous and beautiful and very heartfelt.<br />13. Out From Under - 5/5 - One of my favorite songs from the circus album! Incredibly gorgeous, i love it soooo much!<br />14. You Got It All - 4/5 - This was a bonus track on Oops!...I Did It Again, so it's probably not as well known. It's really beautiful and I love her vocals so much in it. They sound so natural and not tied back with autotuned. It truly shows the amazing vocals of Britney Spears.<br />15. Showdown - 5/5 - One of my favorites from In The Zone! Incredibly amazing vocals that are breathy in a powerful way.<br />16. That's Where You Take Me - 4/5 - There's a weird story about this song - apparently it was like a single off Britney, but barely. It's like Anticipating - it counted as a 'single' but nobody even really knew that it was. I guess it was just like a promotional single. Either way, it's still really pretty & catchy and I love it.<br /><br />Hope this helped - buy this CD!!well known. It's really beautiful and I love her vocals so much in it.

B003TH41H4|5.0|This has got to be back on air, what an amazing show this is. The perfect place for it I think is SyFy, They did air the first season, it was a perfect match for  that station, I would think. if not that than showtime, something of the sort, I just think ABC gave the show a bad wrap, ABC was to quick to cancel the show did not give it a shot and real  bad times for it to  be on air, not too many people are up at 2am to see a show like this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i really love it! its very addicting, fun, and challenging. it also increases your brain power by a harder challenge with each level you pass. Great! Love it! i would definatly recommend it!
B001FB55H6|5.0|Imagine, if you can, that the Watchmen comic book didn't exist, and this movie is its own original work.<br /><br />Suddenly this movie is one of the best superhero movies of all time. Interesting how that works, huh? Better than Avengers, better than Spider-Man 2, better than Dark Knight... This movie has it all. Gritty action, awesome heroes, great effects, lots of characters with real feelings and personalities, a coherent storyline that unfolds well, excellent use of music (that opening! OMG), great flashbacks, incredible acting...<br /><br />Stop hating and enjoy it like you know you should.

0307341577|4.0|Lately I've been hearing a lot about author Gillian Flynn, especially with her new novel Gone Girl recently coming out. So I decided to read her other 2 books first. Dark Places is such an amazing, character driven murder mystery, I can hardly wait to delve into her other books.<br /><br />Flynn really has a talent for writing both realistic & interesting characters, all the while having the story itself be just as compelling. A rare feat I find.<br /><br />In Dark Places, Libby Day at 7 was the only survivor when her family was massacred 24 years ago. The accused murderer? Her 15 year old brother Ben, who Libby herself testified against when she was so little. Now grown up, highly dysfunctional & strapped for cash, Libby gets pulled back into the past by the Kill Club, people obsessed with her families murders & full of conspiracy theories over what really happened that night.<br /><br />This is a great character driven whodunnit story. Libby is a greatly flawed protagonist but so fun to read about. I highly recommend this book & I am excited to read Gillian Flynn's other novels asap.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Outstanding interface, fun to play. I don't even know if there are any instructions, just started playing it. One of the better mind clearing activities I've found. Runs great on the Kindle Fire.

B00846REIS|5.0|I found this book as a recommendation that I would enjoy it if I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.  Since Fifty is one of my favorite trilogies I decided to give it a try.  Needless to say the first quarter of the book I did not enjoy as much because I was comparing it to Fifty Shades, which this book is NOT.  I finally had to put FSoG out of my mind in order to give this book its full due.  Once I did that I really enjoyed the book.  The story between Gideon and Eva was enjoyable to read and I look forward to the next installment in order to continue their story.  While I think this book is a 5-star book and well worth the read, it is no Fifty Shades. There was chemistry between Gideon and Eva but nothing compared to Christian and Ana.  The only thing I enjoyed about this book over FSoG is that this one was written in a much better writing style.  But with that being said I enjoyed the story of Christian and Ana over that of Gideon and Eva.  This book was done a disservice by being compared to Fifty Shades, as such it falls short.  Promoted on its own merits this book would do much better.
0553582038|3.0|As noted many people basically despise this book. I take this point in the series as much anticipated fluff. Sure it drolls on but in the end GRRM is going to have to tie this stuff up somewhere. Whilst it is sometimes painstaking to read I suggest that it is for the better for the series. I found that by consuming a relatively high volume of alcohol during the cersei, brienne, and all other chapters that aren't arya, sam, sansa, or jaimie, helped greatly during this read. While is is not necessary i  I found it to be quite comical. In essence cersei is a bleating goat, brienne is dull as a box of rocks and these unnamed spontaneous additions remind me of the daunting read that is the Silmarillion(tolkein). But hey, overall it isn't as bad as some say. GRRM is a masterful writer and is doing what needs to be done to give us a complete rendition of this story. Had there been the intended 5 year gap there would be just as many people complaining about the missing information. Well naysayers, eat your heart out because you asked for it. I am with this tale to the end and suggest that we all endure this with the author. The scale of this alone allows for a few low points within the series. Stay true my fellow hardcore readers and for those of you who want to complain.... SUCK IT UP!

B007VI4TKQ|2.0|If it weren't for Marlon Brando wearing an ice bucket, Val Kilmer doing an impression of the corpulent star, and Fairuza Balk providing fleeting moments of sympathy as the \\"panther girl,\\" this deservedly maligned adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel would be completely unwatchable. As it is, this rendition of \\"Moreau\\" is still pretty awful - and actually worse than I recall it being upon its original, end-of-summer `96 theatrical release.<br /><br />Much has been written about how original director Richard Stanley was fired several days into shooting, only to sneak back onto the set of his would-be film by donning some of Stan Winston's make-up effects. The tumultuous nature of the shoot was also intensified by star Val Kilmer's decision to back out of the film's main lead, bringing Rob Morrow in to fill the vacancy...until Morrow had the good sense to bow out, leading David Thewlis to take over. If that wasn't enough chaos, John Frankenheimer replaced Stanley, bringing something less than a clear vision of how to handle this (so far) most recent version of the oft-filmed tale.<br /><br />The resulting film is indeed a directionless mess, with lost-at-sea Thewlis being taken in by Kilmer, henchman for Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando), whose work mixing human and animal DNA has lead to the creation of a number of beasts that roam his uncharted tropical island. It doesn't take long, though, before the hybrids start to question their true nature and overthrow Moreau's despotic rule.<br /><br />Brando appears about a half-hour into the picture and departs after chipping in less than 30 minutes of screen time - it's basically an extended cameo that's patently bizarre (Moreau first shows up drenched in sunscreen and later gets a massage from \\"daughter\\" Balk by having her place ice in a barrel that sits on top of his noggin) but dramatically non-existent. Moreau's neither interesting, scary or sympathetic in the picture - a problem that also extends to every other character, including Thewlis' unlikeable \\"hero\\" and Kilmer's utterly bizarre turn as Moreau's second-in-command. Apparently difficult to deal with on-set, Kilmer's performance matches the alleged reports of his behavior during production - once Brando has departed, Kilmer turns up the insanity by stuffing his shirt with pillows and pretending to be his top-billed counterpart in several outrageously funny sequences that have the feel of improvisation. Ditto for Kilmer's howler of a death sequence, which has to be seen to be fully believed.<br /><br />Though Kilmer's deranged performance might offer bad movie lovers scattered minutes of amusement, the film provides few pleasures otherwise. While the movie is certainly unpleasant, none of it is engaging dramatically. Frankenheimer brings a leaden touch to the entire picture, failing to play off the obvious eccentricities of Brando or Kilmer and missing the chance to bring some much needed dark comedy to the project. Obviously hampered by a haphazard script, the movie is bereft of action set-pieces and concludes with a confounding, preachy social message that's heavy handed to an extreme. On the visual side, Stan Winston's weak make-up effects rank as some of the great make-up artist's lesser accomplishments, and Digital Domain's early CGI effects are likewise pedestrian. Gary Chang's score is, at least, better than expected, though a far cry from the superb effort Laurence Rosenthal provided to the superior 1977 AIP version with Burt Lancaster, Michael York and Barbara Carrera (which is available on Blu-Ray in a region-free Australian release).<br /><br />New Line's Blu-Ray edition of \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" includes the slightly gorier 100-minute, unrated cut of the picture in an AVC encoded 1080p transfer. Though lacking any obvious use of DNR, this isn't that stellar of a presentation, with some noise evident in the day time shots and not a ton of HD detail present. Nevertheless, I'm guessing the problem lies with the source material and this is probably as good as the picture will ever look. The DTS MA audio is decent, and extras include two theatrical trailers (featuring the unforgettable combination of dialogue lines \\"Father???....Oh My God!\\") and a brief Making Of promo featurette with Kilmer, once again, acting off-the-wall. Perhaps it was a method performance?

B007STBUIW|5.0|The original summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's JAWS quickly became my favorite film growing up, having devoured it on VHS and on ABC's Sunday Night Movie presentation (the one with the added footage) so many times I could recite dialogue before I was out of grade school. Over the years I've been able to see it on the big screen (thanks to a visit with Lukas on Martha's Vineyard back in `96 or so), but despite that - and having reviewed numerous laserdisc and DVD releases over the years - only now with Universal's Blu-Ray edition do I feel like I've really, completely seen \\"Jaws.\\" This is a spectacular HD presentation on every level and is sure to thrill fans of this classic 1975 screen adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestseller.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about the movie that hasn't been written or documented - from behind-the-scenes books to countless documentaries - since the film's 1975 release date. Spielberg's miraculous direction took advantage of every difficult production situation to create an all-time film masterwork that's always been as satisfying for its unforgettable characterizations, surprising humor and memorable atmosphere as it is a white-knuckle thriller about a great white marauding swimmers off the shores of Amity Island. As I write in my review of the terrific \\"Jaws: Memories From Martha's Vineyard\\" book a year ago, \\"Jaws\\" itself was a collaborative success, one that saw actors from Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw down to extras improvising their lines, giving the film a real, human center that we seldom see in modern filmmaking. The daily shooting schedule couldn't be mapped out all that far in advance since screenwriter Carl Gottlieb spent most nights working on the script with Spielberg - combined with our unpredictable and ever-changing weather here in southern New England, \\"Jaws\\" relied on the people making it so much that it's because of their efforts - as well as Spielberg who marshaled them all together -that the movie overcame its physical production struggles. In fact, had the movie not endured such a tumultous shoot, it's likely that \\"Jaws\\" never would've become the classic it did.<br /><br />Universal has produced a number of \\"100th Anniversary\\" Blu-Rays this year with remastered transfers - the results have ranged from superb to mediocre, but none have looked as brilliantly detailed as \\"Jaws.\\" Restored from high-res 35mm original film elements, this is one of the most satisfying catalog releases the studio has produced on Blu-Ray to date: Bill Butler's cinematography is richly textured down to the finest detail, with warm colors and just a dazzling appearance that, even though I've watched the movie dozens of times, brings new background details to light with a clarity that I've never seen before in any format (there's also, thankfully, been no attempt here at \\"tweaking\\" the movie's color scheme like we've seen on too many BD releases over the years). The water has more depth, the Martha's Vineyard locations come into sharper focus, and just the faintest hint of some filtering is apparent on a transfer that is content to let the movie's natural cinematography speak for itself. It just looks phenomenal. On the audio side, viewers can select from the movie's original mono soundtrack as well as another, \\"rethought\\" 7.1 DTS MA stereo remix, both of which are more full-bodied than their DVD counterparts, though purists may still object to some of the alterations in the latter (i.e. the \\"new\\" gunshots at the end still sound closer to the controversial 5.1 DVD remix from a decade ago than they do the original mono recording; in other instances, though, the newer effects are much closer to the mono mix than the 2001 version. It's at least a noticeable improvement in that regard).<br /><br />Extra features are something of a letdown, mainly because they're almost all in non-anamorphic, 4:3 standard-definition and suffer from low bit-rates. The \\"Jaws Archives,\\" for example, is comprised of direct screen captures from the laserdisc, many of which look blurry and should've been cleaned up for high-def. Ditto for the deleted scenes, which appear to be filtered and ported straight off the LD (and the DVD). The eight-minute \\"From The Set\\" segment includes candid footage of the production's first few days on-location in Martha's Vineyard. Included here is priceless footage of Carl Gottlieb falling overboard and into the icy, early May waters of the Atlantic -- all for the abandoned first attempt Spielberg made at showing the discovery of Ben Gardner's boat. It's a wonderful segment and it's a shame it doesn't go on longer than it does.<br /><br />Laurent Bouzereau's dry but essential two-hour documentary from the `90s Signature Collection laserdisc is back, and it's been complemented by \\"The Shark is Still Working,\\" a 2007 labor of love doc from James Gelet, Jake Gove, Erik Hollander, and James-Michael Roddy that treads over ground previously traveled by numerous other behind-the-scenes docs, as well as profiles other aspects glossed over by them (such as an interview with Percy Rodriguez, who performed the voice over for the film's classic theatrical trailer). Unfortunately, the inferior visual presentation does no favors to the program, with heavy compression and \\"jaggies\\" present throughout its 103 minutes. Finally, the movie's original, primary theatrical trailer is also on-hand here, in a likewise poor, non-anamorphic standard-def presentation that's worse than its laserdisc appearance from years ago. Of course, given that the prior DVD didn't have trailers of any kind, it's at least an improvement in that regard (the movie's original teaser is a regrettable omission yet again).<br /><br />The sole new addition is an eight-minute look at Universal's restoration efforts on the picture, presented in HD, plus a digital copy and Ultraviolet copy. The disc is housed in a standard two-disc Elite case with one of Universal's nice 100 Yearsslipcovers; fans looking for more deluxe packaging ought to check out Best Buy's exclusive (though pricier) Digibook release, or the UK's Steelbook edition, which arrives in early September.<br /><br />Ultimately, Universal has done one of their crown jewels proud with a Blu-Ray that boasts one of the format's finest catalog transfers - not just from Universal, but any label. Spectacular! (

B000SEI230|5.0|I watched the movie A Walk To Remember before reading the book. Actually, I read the book because I watched the movie, expecting the two to be very similar. Although there are basic similarities between the two, such as the play and Jamie being ill, there are many more differences. In my mind, these differences can be summed up in the basic cultural differences between the late 1950's, when the book was to have taken place, and the late 1990's, when the movie was to have taken place. Carter's personality is different between the book and the movie, but his underlying heart remains the same: he wants to be a good person and do what is right. Jamie's character is very similar to that of the movie. Many of the scenes and character in the movie are absent from the book.<br /><br />The story itself is still beautiful, being more basic. The reader can experience more of the thoughts and emotions that Carter goes through as he falls in love with Jamie, since the story is told through his eyes. This is the first Nicolas Sparks book I have read, and I'm sure I will be reading more! Highly Recommended!

0345803507|3.0|Over all I have to say I enjoyed this series. It's certainly not the best I've read but it's far from the worst as well. Having read all three books in this trilogy I can now state with certainty that book three is my least favorite of the three. Why? Even though it has some fairly transparent plot twists it's far too long and by the time I reached this third book in the trilogy the rabid over-use of the \\"Oh my!\\" or some other combination with the word \\"Oh\\" in front of it gets so annoying I found I could no longer ignore it...as does the over use of the \\"f***\\". I can honestly say this is the first time I've ever heard anyone utter the phrase \\"thank f***!\\" I heard that and thought to myself...huh?????<br /><br />Once again I do find the primary story between the two main characters interesting. I enjoyed seeing their relationship evolve and traverse issues. Unlike many readers who provide a negative review I don't view this as an abusive relationship. Dysfunctional..yes, but not abusive. Had both characters not been trying to work together through issues, worked on recognizing their own issues, and worked on finding their own path I may have said that yes, it is an abusive relationship...but that's not the dynamic between these two characters so no, it's not abusive.  It's a mutually loving (although highly dysfunctional) relationship between two completely consensual adults.<br /><br />I've stated in previous reviews of the other books that the BDSM component of this book is a 3rd character that remains in the background, in this last book it goes even further into the background...it's barely even a component of this book. Yes, yes, yes...once again there is tons of sex in this book but this IS a relationship between two completely consensual adults. They may occasionally do something that some people may consider taboo but it is the most vanilla flavored BDSM I've ever seen...so I don't even really consider it to be that, it's just kinky sex between two people who love each other and enjoy it. Big deal!  It's all part of a physically healthy relationship.<br /><br />My main complaint with this book (aside from the verbage repition mentioned above) is how long this book is. I noticed while listening to it that it felt like it should have ended two hours before it truly did.  I'm certain had I actually read it I probably would have closed the book without reading through all the extra epilogues and perspectives. There were several spots where the author truly could have ended this book and it would have been complete. This leaves you with the feeling that \\"it's over\\" and then she adds something more, then you feel \\"it's over\\" again and she adds an unnecessary character perspective at two ages. Ordinarily I wouldn't have an issue with that but this time it just felt odd, too much, it felt unnecessary. I think perhaps instead of adding so much at the end of this story that perhaps all of this additional information would have made a good companion book. That's just my perspective on that though.<br /><br />Over all I really did enjoy the series but some of the issues with this last book left me ranking this book just the 3 stars (for pure entertainment) instead of a 4 star as I have the other two.<br /><br />Once again, read it and make up your own mind...I think aside from just a few issues you'll enjoy it.love each other and enjoy it.

B0058YPGL6|4.0|I dig this show a lot, and I was all set to hate it.  I thought it was just going to be another bad take on Twilight, and Twilight was bad enough, but I was pleasantly suprised, when on the recommendation of a family member I sat down and watched Teen Wolf.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The show is a well written show that cleverly combines action, comedy, horror, and drama, sometimes into the same scene.  The cast is also really great.  You usually don't find young stars like this that can actually act, but these people can.  Through their performances we get to know, and care about the characters.  As an avid horror fan I will say that this isn't really scary, nor is it really meant to be, but it still sinks it's claw into you and keeps you interested.<br /><br />If I could throw out any criticisms it would be that most of the CGI, and fight scenes aren't the best, it's nothing that actually takes you out of it, but it's definitely not the best out there.  Though I will say, Season 2 has done better on both of these fronts, I'm guessing due to a larger budget on account of it's success.  I can't wait to finish season 2 and I sit impatiently for the start of season 3.<br /><br />I watched all of season 1 before I actually bought the dvd, and I was curious if anyone knows:  On the back it says \\"This series is musically edited\\".  What does this mean?  Is the music on the dvd different than the original aired verison?<br /><br />If anyone can clear this up I'd appericate it, thanks.
B007P06DJK|3.0|White man covers black music and gets huge hit from it. Sound familiar? If you want to listen to the real thing, check out any of the multitude of recordings by Juluka, Savuka, or Johnny Clegg.

Very apt, since Propaganda are a German band, who dragged their version of melody-heavy electronic music cantilevered onto breathy vocals well into the nineties, but then were on hiatus for many years until Claudia Br&uuml;cken, Ralf D&ouml;rper and Susanne Freytag performed (of all places) at Scala in London in 2011. Thomas Leer was supposed to be there too, but had to cancel because of surgery. Makes you wonder, did the first cut hurt at all? Did the third have him on his knees? Do they make surgical incisions with a dueling saber in Prussia?<br /><br />Ah, Propaganda.They don't make music like they used to.

B0084A9CA2|4.0|It's an easy read. Spare language. Straightforward in ideas.<br /><br />The young man, Siddhartha, has a searching spirit, asking universal questions:<br /><br />>>>>>\\"They knew, the Brahmans and their holy books, they knew everything, they had taken care of everything and of more than everything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, of food, of inhaling, of exhaling, the arrangement of the senses, the acts of the gods, they knew infinitely much - but was it valuable to know all of this, not knowing that one and only thing, the most important thing, the solely important thing?<br /><br />\\"... His father was to be admired, quiet and noble were his manners, pure his life, wise his words, delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow  but even he, who knew so much, did he live in blissfulness, did he have peace, was he not also just a searching man, a thirsty man? Did he not, again and again, have to drink from holy sources ... why did he, the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day, strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?<br /><br />\\"Was not Atman in him, did not the pristine source spring from his heart? It had to be found, the pristine source in own's own self, it had to be possessed! Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting lost.\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Siddhartha left his comfortable circumstances at home to live the rootless life of an ascetic, met *the* Buddha (fka Siddhartha Gautama) along the way, slowly built a life rooted in attachments, discovered suffering, and .... [don't want to spoil the ending].<br /><br />Mr. Hesse lets his Siddhartha express directly the ideas relating to how one's attachment to feelings, outcomes, and things do not bring peace and, indeed, can detract from it. His Siddhartha is also explicit about suffering and its relationship to understanding and compassion.<br /><br />Mr. Hesse more indirectly reveals what Siddhartha doesn't see about himself - the arrogance and intolerance toward others that he possesses, a malady shared by many of us who are \\"enlightened\\" in some manner, whether it be by a certain theology, yoga, what to eat, how to travel, or otherwise live or think.<br /><br />It's a good reminder that, as some say less elegantly than Mr. Hesse, \\"we're all bozos on the bus.\\"toward others that he possesses, a malady shared by many of us who are \\"enlightened\\" in some manner, whether it be by a certain theology, yoga, what to eat, how to travel, or otherwise live or think.<br /><br />It's a good reminder that, as some say less elegantly than Mr. Hesse, \\"we're all bozos on the bus.\\"

B006ZXZWP4|4.0|Tina Fey combines lots of chuckles in this very funny but also-serious memoir.  Fey brings many laughs with her off-beat wit and references to sex, even when she occasionally goes over the line.  But her top accomplishment may be her open discussion of her fears and anxieties.  Like so many of us, Tina grew up feeling shy, self-conscious and unattractive.  She describes her loving parents, anxieties, and hanging out with gay theater pals as a teen and then feeling hurt when they hooked up with other guys. She also describes attending the University of Virginia, plus the many characters she met at the YMCA in suburban Evanston after graduation (1992) while she took night improv classes at Chicago's Second City.  Then we follow her as she moves to Saturday Night Live as a writer (and later newsreader), starting her show 30 Rock, her marraige, raising her daughter, etc. Don't miss her chapter on imitating Sarah Palin during the 2008 Presidential campaign, the photo's alone should crack you up - SNL actually called her back to do that role.  Still, along with the laughs I enjoyed her revelations as an honest, vulnerable (and attractive) woman.<br /><br />Note: I used to work out evenings at that YMCA in Evanston.  Never met Ms. Fey (she worked mornings) but she has Gregory, Mr. Myrkykvsk, and the feel of the place down pat.

I even found myself laughing at a few of them, most of them I just skimmed through, very repetitious. I don't know, I'm in my 60's and my lips have never \\"twitched\\", not even sure what that looks like. Did you know Christian's eyes are gray? I'd like to punch Ana's inner goddess in the face.

The ending was not what I wanted for the characters or expected, but I don't think it diminishes the quality of the writing or the overall book in any way. This is a smart thriller written by a smart writer.  Not a Pulitzer Prize winner by any stretch, but quite an enjoyable escape!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|its a really cool game but my controls aren't working anymore. but still it is a good game! love the game only one problem.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app ;  I enjoy it immensely . I enjoy the abililty for it to read aloud. I would highly recommend for others.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I love this movie. It has the corny 80's vibe that make movies stick with you. Flash is your average jock superhero, rocketed in to outer space and is way out of his element. But he triumphs over the evil Ming and wins the day. I must confess, main reason i bought this movie was because of the movie \\"Ted\\". Got to see \\"Ted\\" for my birthday and actually on my birthday, had no idea that Sam Jones (Flash) was in it. The crazy thing is I had actually watched \\"Flash\\" on t.v. the night before, and then to see it on the big screen, it was just a holy beeeeeeep moment.<br /><br />So I know this isn't a helpful review, but if your looking for an awesomely epic 80's movie, \\"Flash Gordon\\" is your ticket there.
B008MEM24S|2.0|The Game is awesome but after a few minutes it start to slow down to the point of stuttering, not the sound but the images, in my samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 when this happens I have to close the game to restart it again, that kills the fun of it. I also have where is my water by the Disney people/company with no stuttering issues.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|What a mess. A thoroughly entertaining, ridiculously over the top, with plotting you could fly a bat through mess. A convoluted, unstructured, fanciful and even at 2 hours 40+ minutes, incomplete mess.<br /><br />That said I love it! What DKRises lacks in the relative realism of the first two it makes up for in Kapow!<br /><br />If the prison doesn't seem particularly deep and dark and Wayne's recovery seems a little too miraculous and Bain's marshal law seems predictably easy to come by, to live with and predictably easy to topple, Dark Knight Rises slaps you in the face with some throwaway humour and gleefully piles on the coincidences, baddies and death defying escapes as camp as anything from the Adam West series. Significantly, straight edged new rookie cop is told \\"You're a detective now; you're not allowed to believe in coincidences.\\" Except for those on every page of the script, of course...<br /><br />Anne Hathaway shoots to the top of my Sheldon-o-meter as the best of Batman's cat-burglars. Christian Bales' performance seems phoned in from The Machinist, for an actor of his calibre and considering the journey Nolan's Batman has taken, he's given very little actual acting to do. Bain is successfully intimidating but the mask does reduce him somewhat to comic book villain whereas Ledgers Joker, despite the face paint, was scarily real.<br /><br />And finally, where the first two films were true in a great many ways to the revamped vision of Batman as a real hero in a real world torn between justice and revenge, love and duty, in DKRises we're given a CGI'd fairy tale full of crammed in flashbacks, wide scope storytelling, and over reaching set pieces that dissolve any sense of atmosphere, threat and danger and continuity with the previous two movies.<br /><br />So Batman Begins was great, The Dark Knight was a classic, DKRises is... Well, truly, there is a lot here that is risible and poorly done but suffice to say Nolan has finished off his trilogy with a bang: A big, loud, vacuous bang... Michael Bay would be proud...ang: A big, loud, vacuous bang... Michael Bay would be proud...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|When my brother first got this game, I thought it was stupid, but it pulls you in so fast! Watching your village grow and seeing all the animals is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love everything about it,  especially layering multiple sounds. Nice to see an app deliver what it promises. Binaural beats a nice addition. Will upgrade to paid version, because they deserve a few bucks.
0307454568|5.0|This is a great end to \\"The Girl....\\" trilogy.  When I picked up the last book and started reading, I felt like I was home, I knew the characters and was ready to dive into the next plot(s).  Stieg developed his characters nicely.  His loss will be felt by all readers.
034580404X|5.0|I'm not a big reader but when I started reading this book I couldn't put it down!  I would suggest this book to anyone who has an open mind and not easily offended by explicit words.  Also, this book makes you think outside of the box!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is deffintley a great game. These people that are making bad comments should read the description before they get the game!This is rated Five Stars! !!!!<br />  *****
B00821OW8K|5.0|In this end of the world action story you have it all. It is heart warming and action filled with family drama, romance and suspenseful. This is a masterpiece. I think that the aliens are realistic looking and interesting. This show is hopeful in its darker situations. This is a fun and intelligent television show.
0451169514|1.0|I just don't understand all of the good reviews.  A few people told me this was the scariest book they ever read.  There wasn't a moment in reading this entire 1,000+ page book that I found scary.  Yes, maybe if you're a child or teenager.  So I thought - well maybe it gets better...maybe the ending will be good.  None of the above.  Wasted a lot of time on this, will probably be the last Stephen King book I ever read.

0345803485|1.0|This book was somewhat amusing until about 20% through on Kindle. You could tell Grey was different but it was disgusting to find that he was a dominatrix sex fiend. I don't mind well-written books with some sex scenes but this was like a horror movie scene that I would never want to revisit. I want my money back.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster. can be a little frustrating at first but then it is not so bad to toy around with.
B007SGM084|1.0|If I ever write a really crappy book, I'm hiring Ms. James's publicity people to hype it for me.<br />I kept reading, hoping that it would live up to all the buzz.  Nah. As \\"erotica,\\" it falls way short.<br />As literature, well...it definitely isn't literature. The constant references to lip-licking/biting convinced me that the heroine probably had a severe case of chapped lips by the end of the story. I mean, the sex episodes starting being downright humorous after a while.  (Oh no!  Not AGAIN!).  If it is made into a move, it should be portrayed as the comedic farce that it is.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Just for a disclaimer, I'm a huge BB fan, they've been my favorite since I was a teenager, & that was decades ago.  I wasn't expecting that much and was pleasantly surprised.  A very good effort by Brian & the guys.  Saw them in concert (50th Tour) and they were amazing, really blew me away, singing stuff I never thought I'd hear live, like \\"All This Is That\\".  It was truly incredible they were all able to put the past aside & give their fans a great gift.  For those who follow the band at all realize a reunion of this magnitude was unthinkable just a few years ago.  A new album with new material and a months long world tour.  Are you kidding me!  Brian definitely still has a magic touch, at least at the arrangement level.  Now, understand there isn't anything very deep per say.  IOW, if you're looking for a \\"Surf's Up\\" or a \\"Till I Die\\" it isn't here.  That isn't necessarily a criticism, because perhaps they got exactly what they were aiming for: a very pleasant sounding album loaded with lush harmonies, especially on songs like \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\", which I was shocked to discover was a Love only effort originally written in the late 70's. An absolute must for anyone remotely a fan.  There's an oddity or two, such as \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\", but there isn't anything that really disappoints.  You'll never get tired of listening to \\"Isn't It Time\\", although speaking of time I was surprised at the brevity of some of the songs.  Sometimes I found myself thinking: Is that song over already?  And I would have liked for Al, Bruce and even David to have had a little more prominent role in leading vocals, but that's a minor point.  They also get help from the very talented Jeff Foskett (who's also on tour providing the falsettos). Furthermore, I was very pleased to hear Al Jardine say in a recent TV interview that he'd like to see the reunited band continue to tour each year or every other year, until they can't do it anymore.  Let's hope that comes true.

0743298039|5.0|\\"There is something about words.  In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.\\"  This line is taken from the first chapter of \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" and that is exactly what Diane Setterfield's words did to me.  She took me prisoner and captured me with her writing, her story, her descriptions.  She deftly takes you along in the story, and through the character, Vida Winters, she provides the rules about reading the story, enjoying each part of its structure (the beginning, middle and the end), not getting ahead of the story.  But like Margaret Lea, you can't help but want to peek ahead, to solve the mystery.  It was hard not to peek ahead, but I abided by the rules she set out and was rewarded for following them, as the story naturally unfolded in each chapter.  I finished the book yesterday and today I am more enthralled.  I can't wait to read it again.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Story and cinematography is incredible.  Just little disappointed that the season was so short on episodes.  Too many extras to count, a collectors item.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app a lot. I use it quite often (on kindle fire), I don't think it has crashed once. Yes, there are pop-ups, but that's what you get for getting free apps... I quickly dismiss the ads and I'm good to go. I think it's of pretty good quality (having experienced some faulty apps, I can confirm this one is quite sturdy...)
0812993292|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry has a simple premise; Harold Fry receives a letter from a dying friend, Queenie, that he hasn't seen in 20 years, but on his way to post his reply, he simply keeps walking to deliver the letter in person.<br /><br />\\"Harold would have been the first to admit that there were elements to his plan that were not finely tuned. But when the idea of saving Queenie blooms in the fallow soil of his mind, he can't be stopped. \\"I will keep walking,\\" he declares, \\"and she must keep living.\\"<br /><br />This is a simple book, but Joyce writes well and realistically about the physical demands and tolls that the pilgrimage takes. Along the way, Harold recalls memories of his life and family. Considering these remembrances and the questions he asks himself is even more difficult than his physical journey. Joyce's writing of Harold at his lowest is exceptional. He gains some followers along the way, and as many others have mentioned, this may be the book's weakest point. They felt like a distraction to me, and I was glad to get back to Harold, his wife Maureen, and Queenie.<br /><br />I think one reason that many people have enjoyed this book is that it is so easy to imagine ourselves as Harold.<br /><br />\\"It must be the same all over England. People were buying milk, or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling weight of the thing they were carrying inside. The inhuman effort it took sometimes to be normal, and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday. The loneliness of that.\\"<br /><br />Harold is lonely and haunted by the mistakes he made, but he also has a sense of hope and courageousness, even in the face of illness and reality. Rachel Joyce gives the reader that gift, without mawkishness or sentimentality.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this setup it was very fun and difficult at the same time good for young kids too so have fun<br />so enjoy adults and kids

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Ambiguity is something that can make a movie great! Rosemary's Baby, The Innocents, Inception, all great films that left their audiences excitedly puzzled and leaves the viewer drawing his or her own conclusions about the movie's mysteries. Such is the case with Prometheus- and I think the mixed reviews stem from many of the Alien fans expecting more face-hugging. Looking past the fact that there are very few H.R. Giger aliens in the film it still has a strong and stable story-line and wonderful cast. Should- in my view be a classic of the sci-fi genre in future!
B004I8WD6E|3.0|The case fits the iphone just fine but the sharp corners and boxy feel make it bulkier than it should be.

1401216676|4.0|I heard about the book \\"the killing joke\\" and found out it is expected you have read before you can call yourself a batman or comic book fan.  So ofcoure i bought it, craving a wonderful book.  I wouldn't quite call it that.  First of all im going to start with the good.  Just to get this out of the way, the art is the best in any batman story i've read.  After reading this story I read the dark knight returns (which is also a beloved graphic novel) and found the drawings couldn't even stand up to that of \\"the killing joke\\".  Another good part of this book was the effect it had on the dc universe.  This is the story when barbara gordon becomes oracle.  Also the origin of The Joker is the first time i had ever felt sympathy for one the most well known villains in the world.  The finding out that he was once a normal human being makes it even more disturbing.  The story is also fairly well thought out.<br /><br />Now for the negatives, the book is way to short.  The orignal story was written this way, and i understand that they can't change that.  But add some bonus content.  The short story about a closet psychopath who wants to kill batman doesn't seem like enough, and considering i paid 20 bucks for the book i felt a little bit like i was ripped off.  Thats the thing about being so short.  Luckily the book is very re-readable but i still think that you would be better off buying the long halloween which takes days to read instead half an hour like this one.  One last thing. KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY!  There's a fair share of deformed and dead people.  Also SPOILER barabara is stripped down naked after she gets shot and the joker takes pictures of her and shows them to a naked James gordon who is being bombarded with special needs midget toddlers with cattle prauds.  This book kind of messes with your mind even though it is very good.  if you have spare money, then buy the killing joke.  It is a great book.
B006RUJST6|1.0|This book bored me. Many of the reviews I read recommended this book after reading \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\" The characters were boring, and the story was unbelievable. Ok, so \\"50 Shades\\" isn't exactly believable, but at least it wasn't depressing like this book. There was no sexual tension between Will & Lake. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B001HN6922|1.0|This movie starts out with a scene with guns, bombs, etc.  It is horrible.  Not for little kids at all! The first movie was so lighthearted and endearing.  This one attempts to be a James Bond movie....which doesn't work for little kids! Very disappointed.

I was a little disappointed with the ending though. I thought it would turn out a certain way and got thrown for a loop when all of  a sudden the story line ended with no real wrap up of the main issue of the book.

0060555661|3.0|Warren Buffett is on record that Benjamin Graham's &#34;The intelligent investor&#34; is the best book on investing. Indeed Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffett's mentor.  (Just search youtube for Buffet and Graham.)  However, this is not the original book written by Benjamin Graham. Graham's advice has been defaced by gratuitously-inserted, lengthy, and uniformed commentary chapters by the journalist Jason Zweig.  (It is misleading that Graham is listed as the sole author.) Indeed, one would conclude from page 507 of Zweig's drivel that Warren Buffett's Berkshire share repurchase plan is &#34;sinister&#34;, when in fact it is clearly the most tax-efficient way to distribute company profits to shareholders.  Get the original edition, it is better.

B00782O7IY|5.0|'The Artist' was not on my list of must-see films. When released to theaters (just barely available where I live), I thought that this B&W film without dialogue was nothing more than a novelty. I was wrong. It deservedly won the Academy Award for best picture. Although the similar themed Martin Scorcese film 'Hugo' was my personal favorite for 2011, I concluded after watching the DVD of 'The Artist'  that Michel Hazanavicius's 'The Artist' was the better film.<br /><br /> On the surface, 'The Artist' can easily be seem as a rewrite of 'A Star is Born'. It is a simple story of the rise and fall of a Hollywood male silent screen star molded in the image of Douglas Fairbanks and the rise of a beautiful adoring female singer and dancer who secretly loves him. The director eliminates all dialogue (or more accurately, almost all dialogue) and replaces it with a few dialogue cards and music scores. The director also films the movie in B&W to capture the era of silent film.<br /><br /> Knowledgeable film fans will notice some anachronisms early in the film. The film clips used at the beginning of one of George Valintin's silent films is more in the style of the middle 1930's and the opening credit sequence  could have been lifted out of an early 1940's B movie. Astute viewers will also notice that the director uses music scores from films that cover the entire era of filmmaking from the 1920's to the 1950's including the infamous (at least according to Kim Novak) use of Bernard Hermann's music from Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'. There is a reason for all of this.<br /><br /> 'The Artist' is about the art of making films. Hazanavicius eliminates dialogue to force the focus of the viewer on the actors and their craft. The actors use body movements and facial expressions to convey their feelings to the audience. The viewer MUST watch this film to understand it. You can not sit back, ignore the screen, and just listen to dialogue. The viewer needs to be actively involved to watch thisfilm as if you were viewing a foreign language film with subtitles but without the annoyance of having to shift your attention from the vusial content to the subtitles. Hazanvicius carefully shoots his actors to accentuate the action on screen by choosing appropriate angles and point of view. Each scene is also perfectly framed and staged to convey the meaning of each scene. The director also uses B&W to force the viewer to watch the film as a purely visual experience without the distraction of color.<br /><br /> In summary, 'The Artist' is an exercise in filmmaking that film school graduates would immeditely appreciate. It is all here. A display of the art of film and a sublte history of Hollywood in the 1920's and 1930's as well. It is no wonder that this film caught the attention of the film making community. 'The Artist' is one of the best films ever made about film making. It should also be noted that this film about Hollywood was not made by an American but by a film making production team from France. Foreign directors seem to often be keen observers of American culture. Highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Katniss Everdeen was honorable, strong-minded and courageous, but she also had a coldness and excessive pessimism about her, particularly toward Peeta, that I could could not like. Even though I didn't much care for her as a character, I did enjoy this story. A very different world, presented in first person, and a story that holds you captive to the end. I look forward to reading the second book in this series, Catching Fire, and I hold out hope that I will warm to Katniss as the series continues.

B007QNRMUU|4.0|I have been a Jason Mraz fan for a while, and even tho I feel this album is a bit different than what I was used to I still loved it. He stays true to what he is famous for,but he plays more and takes more chances with the lyrics. He writes about every kind of love (including a song about his grandfather that I just adore). But most of the album is about the love you feel for that special person in your life, and the feelings you have when you are not close to that person. Definitely worth my money!

B008NAFU9A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton has once again wowed me with her writing in her latest release, Her Sweetest Downfall.  I fell in love with Hamilton's characters in The Forever Girl , so I wasn't too surprised when I found Ophelia's story enthralling.  We are introduced to Ophelia at the end of the Forever Girl.  She plays a crucial role in helping Sophia, and now we get to see why that is.<br /><br />We drop into Ophelia's life as she heads off to run an errand for her employer.  But on her journey into the woods she hears a violin playing.  Her experience turns to terror when she is chased by a stranger who whisks her away from her ordinary world.  The man informs Ophelia that she has been chosen for a higher calling.  Ophelia is drawn to her captor and the resultant romance between she and Ethan is fulfilling.  The only thing I didn't like about it was how much Ophelia's conflicting emotions resemble Stockholm syndrome.  I think this is mainly due to this being a novella.  We don't get to see as much of the motivation and interaction as we would in a full length novel.<br /><br />That being said, I was engrossed in the mythology of the Crurors, and Shifters, and Fae.  I found Ethan a fantastic hero, and Ophelia a realistic protagonist for her time where women had to be a bit meek to survive.  Even though the story was relatively short, it felt natural and not rushed at all.  I have to admit that the experience wasn't as exciting as reading the Forever Girl, however, I would still give it 4.5 stars because of the feelings it invoked from me.  I thoroughly enjoyed stepping into this world once again, and I can't wait for the continuation of Sophia's story in 2013.<br />Can't come soon enough for me =0D

Instead, you will find an interesting, imaginative dark tale that slowly unfolds like a mystery. Ever step of the way it's hard to guess what will happen. I enjoyed the imagination, and the soul behind it.

0141439475|5.0|It was the discovery of Frankenstein that prompted me [[ASIN:0983898901 Frankenstein's Daemon]] to write a sequel to this revered classic. What revelations blossomed when I read the book. Who knew the monster could communicate so eloquently. Like many, my acquaintance with Victor Frankenstein's creation came from Hollywood. Mary Shelley's novel is far removed from those onscreen versions. Many books have been written on Frankenstein: its themes, its place in literature in the broad historical perspective. Literary commentary on Frankenstein seems to be born daily. I had somehow escaped the required reading of Frankenstein in my high school and college days and my sympathy for the monster was rather muted based on film. However, Shelley's novel gripped me from the beginning. Despite what may be taught in literature classes across the world, a few points about the novel struck me. Readers must remember that Shelley wrote the book based on a kind of parlor game. Was it a mark of her genius that she was able to abstract her concepts from essentially a \\"waking dream?\\" The themes gathered in this book, for the time, are truly remarkable. Also, who is the villian here, if one is needed at all? If there is one, the answer is not clear cut. You must read the novel yourself to make the determination. While Karloff elicites a bumbling sympathy for his monster, Shelley crafts a complex creature who feels pain acutely - so acutely that he displays a wide range of human characteristics. He is, after all, a thinking, feeling creation. Love, sympathy, betrayal, murder,and gothic elements that veer into melodrama populate Shelley's novel. However, it is a great work and one, perhaps, that does not need a sequel - unless the desire to learn the monster's fate is too strong.
B007WFQZF0|5.0|This is a very consistent, very accomplished album.  It's smooth, and that, not the obvious move to electronica, may be the biggest difference between WIXIW and earlier Liars albums.  Even where the beats sound mechanical and could be abrasive -- on the Autechre side of things -- they're not.  There is a certain continuity from Sisterworld to WIXIW, a continuity of attitude and ambience, the sense of living in a vast, dark, urban landscape that is vaguely menacing.<br /><br />Some have said it's all textures rather than hits, and while I agree there are probably no hits, I think this overlooks the strong beats and melodies found throughout.  It may not be a dance album, but it certainly lends itself to dance remixes.<br /><br />Within the universe of smooth electronica, there is a fascinating diversity across the eleven tracks.  One common element, though, is the falsetto crooning vocals.  This is the one thing that doesn't always hit me quite right, but it does assist in creating the album's stylistic coherence.<br /><br />I disagree with those who say this album is more adventurous and experimental than the last two.  It may be adventurous for the Liars to tackle a type of music they haven't played before, but it doesn't sound all that radical to the listener, not if you've heard electronica over the years.  In fact, I think this is the Liars' most accessible album.<br /><br />WIXIW is not as abrasive as Liars (2007) or [[ASIN:B0030F7Y2Y Sisterworld (2010)]], and I don't think it's a masterpiece on the level of Sisterworld (see my review).  It's not as ambitious -- it's not really *about* anything, other than relationships.  (WIXIW, it turns out, is pronounced \\"wish you.\\")<br /><br />This is an album that sounds great, sets a mood, but not one that has Something To Say.  I could give it four stars by comparison with Sisterworld, but that doesn't seem like the right point of comparison.  Compared to most of the rest of what's out there today in pop/rock, it's a five star album without a doubt.e star album without a doubt.
034580404X|5.0|In my opinion, this story is absolutely amazing. I purchased the books about 2 weeks ago and finished the first 2 within 4 days. I had to hold off on reading the third because I'm not quite ready for it to be over! Well that and I have library books that need my attention and are now overdue. Lol<br />This is a great series and I hope E. L. James gives us a little more Christian Grey in the near future. I'm excited that there is a movie coming out. It will be interesting to see who is cast in the roles of Ana and Christian. Although, in my mind's eye, I picture Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson since she based her characters on the Twilight characters. The places in Seattle mentioned are real (Escala, Heathman Hotel, Pike Market District, etc). I can just imagine watching those beautiful sunsets from an Audi R8 with \\"The Flower Duet\\" from Lakme by Leo Delibes playing while riding along I-5. Very inspiring! So inspiring in fact that my husband and I are planning a trip to Seattle for later in the year.<br />I have also made some major purchases from the iTunes store via my iPad, purchasing all of the music mentioned in the book as well. I like opera, classical, Snow Patrol, Eva Cassidy and others so it was no big deal!<br />To all who know exactly what the book is about, the sunsets and music are not the only things inspiring. It really did spark a \\"change of pace\\" for me and the hubs.<br />Aside from the naughtiness, the storyline itself will keep you interested in between the more sultry parts. I highly recommend!<br /><br />Laters, baby...

0671042858|4.0|Quick and dirty, this is a book about a girl who gets lost in the woods. Of course, nothing ever written by Stephen King has been quick and dirty. Once she is separated from her family, it becomes a race to return to civilization before she loses everything. Along the way, the girl, Tricia, must fight obstacles both real and imagined. Her only weapon against the fear and loneliness are the Red Sox radio broadcasts she can pick up on her Walkman. Days may run together when you're lost in the wilderness, but her Red Sox games kept her in a sense of normalcy. She may have been lost, but her hero Tom Gordon was still saving games. There was still hope, as long as Gordon kept taking the mound. The only question becomes if hope is enough.<br /><br />I don't read as many Stephen King books as I probably should. That might be why the one thing that struck me about this book is that it could actually happen. I may never meet an evil spirit, undead pet, or whatever else might appear in his novels. But, I could get lost in the woods. I could take a left when I should have gone right. That reality made it even more chilling to me. I could see myself wandering in circles. I could imagine waiting for the Sox game to come on, just so I wouldn't have to worry about how scared and alone I was. I could see myself grasping onto a Red Sox game like it was the only thing that could save me. In that case, Tom Gordon was the perfect person for Tricia to idolize. During the season in which the book takes place, Gordon led the American League in saves, saving 43 in a row to end the season. What better player to put all your faith in. To place your hopes and dreams with? Obviously, King is a gifted writer. I don't need to tell anyone that. He is also a great Red Sox fan. I don't need to tell you that either. In this novel, he wonderfully combines the two. As expected, this was a great book. Go find it, and read it. (Maybe not right before bed.)

0452273331|3.0|In writing this book, Ayn Rand, is striving to articulate her philosophy of objectivism.  Put loosely, this involves the maximum level of freedom for the individual as exemplified by laissez faire capitalism.  Rand still has many adherents today some eighty years since the book was first published.<br /><br />The essence of the novel is the life of Howard Roark, an iconoclastic, highly motivated architect.  Against all odds, Roark succeeds as an architect despite numerous set backs mainly related to the fact that he will brook no challenges to his designs.  Once a design has been executed, no one can make a change.  In other words, once given initial instructions, the rest is up to him.  Roark holds a particular loathing for the work of \\"second handers\\"; those people who seek the approval of others without being original.  These people are a drain on society.<br /><br />Despite his obvious unconventionality, Roark eventually succeeds.  There are numerous disruptions along the way but Roark is not a man for changing.  He is driven by the desire to be his own man.<br /><br />Is the book well written?  Well, not particularly.  The characters are mainly implausible but all grist for the mill as Rand pushes to espouse her philosophy.  And, at times, for this reason, the book can be preachy.  Long monologues about the virtue of the individual over the collective do begin to tire after a while.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to others?  Yes, but it depends on the person in question.  To the general reader with no real interest in the philosophy of Ayn Rand, the book will probably fail to be finished.  It is really best read by that person willing to work for at least a passing knowledge of Rand and her philosophy.  Her impact upon society has been significant and it is works such as \\"The Fountainhead\\" that outlines her core rationale.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I've done the first video twice in as many days and I am hooked.  I am in decent shape, but am trying to tone up for a wedding dress measuring. I belonged to a gym for several years and attended regularily, but never really pushed myself. Jillian is like a mean school marm making sure you don't slack during a single move.<br />She is great at motivating the viewer and provides the necessary tips regarding knee safety and breathing with the move. The music is fine, almost unnoticeable. The only thing I wish it had was a more comprehensive cool down. You'll want to stretch a bit more afterward.
B00004CZIZ|1.0|I just want to say that I am always looking for a smooth, satisfactory transaction. I do not spend my money online \\"for fun\\", or because I have just so much of it to throw away, I make purchases to save time. In doing so I expect not to be deceived by the companies that Amazon represent. I bought a DVD from Movie Mars. The item I received was NOT what I agreed to buy. The DVD that was sent to me was a bootleg copy that could not be read by ANY of my devices unless the drive region was changed. This is FRAUD! Getting the company to resolve this matter has been slow, bothersome and down right annoying. I will never purchase from any company that Amazon represents. Thank you for your time. You should thank me for mine.....

B007KOYEOC|4.0|In the three books the story was what kept me interested. The sex part of it was ,to me, rather boring, as if I was a friend just dropping by and when I'd finished the books I wasn't a friend any more. It did nothing to turn me on and I wonder about the stories I hear about women \\"going off\\" after reading it. Sceptical me thinks it's a sales pitch, but I will say that it was the story that kept me reading until the end.  I would recommend the book but from my view, not for the sexy bits .
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a useful app that sets up pretty simply.  The only issue is that it automatically resizes your desktop,  otherwise I would give it 5 stars.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Probably the worst book of this series I read them all and the story line was pretty consistent but this book rambles on and spends chapter after chapter on developing characters that do not intertwine with the first 4 books at all...Have to say I had to convince myself to continue,hoping that the story line would improve!I would not suggest this as a book to read at all.Sorry George but this just is not a good quality book to  read at all,sorry I spent the money to purchase this one.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I finished reading the book but I have not started it yet. My 1st response is that it is layed out faily well. There is alot of information and it can be a bit confusing for someone that has been involved heavily in the industry. If you have never used supplements, there is alot of information to try and figure out. I would have liked to seen more examples of meal plans. This would help figure out what I am suppose to do and when and one example is not enough. The hardest part that I see is determining when to take everything and figuring out how to determine how much of everything so it fits my plan. I really like the concepts and the approach. I am excited to start once I get my head around the diet.<br /><br />I will say that I am very impressed with the responses to my questions. I can't say it is working since I have not started but I can't see any reason it won't if I stick to it. For the price, I would recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|As you know this series is very popular seller. The books are very detailed and saucy, not one for the older generation 60+,don't want them to have a heart attack but then again they might know more than the books.Get your partners to read them to get a few hints!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It seems like every woman is reading this book.  People who don't normally read erotic literature are reading it.  Why the popularity?  I admit, I caved and bought the book.  Reading it reminded me of being 10 years old and sneaking my aunt's \\"True Confessions\\" magazines.  The book is poorly written, maybe 6th grade level.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the author's choice of expressions are redundant. One friend told me that it was more about human relations than sex, but really there is not that much written about the relationships other than the sex.  We don't learn why Christian is such a pervert or anything about his relationship with his \\"perfect\\" family.  That may be revealed in the sequels but I'm not going to waste my money or time on them.  I would not recommend the book at all!  Another co-worker said she thought men ought to read it...what?  Who wants to encourage that behavior?!  The best part of the book was when Ana walks away, but it's obvious she must go back since it is the first of a trilogy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It makes me think. It forces me  to think ahead to complete the level.  And the solution isn't always what you think it should be.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I really like this movie. I saw it at the theaters and it was superb. Epic in fact.<br /><br />I got a copy from BEST BUY and when I got it home, I tried to watch the 3D disc and it screw up the blu-ray links in my player. I reset it by unplugging it for a while but it still wouldn't play. Thinking it was a bad copy, I returned the movie to a different BEST BUY location to exchange it for another and still had the same issue so I took it back and got a refund.<br /><br />I ordered it off of Amazon and still have the same issue. I can't play the 3D disc in my player. Perhaps the first one messed up my player, but I can view other 3D discs just perfectly. This is a strange circumstance.<br /><br />Has anyone else had issues with the 3D disc? Suggestions on resolving this problem are most welcome.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, YES my system is completely 3D compatable as well as my TV.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is in one word...dull.  I read about 200 pages when I couldnt take it anymore and skipped to the last 50 pages (something I have never done before).  Yes... It was painfully boring with uninteresting, unlikable characters.  Nothing drew me into Ana's pathetic little world of idiocity.  She is the saddest excuse of a \\"heroine\\" since...ever.  She's more of a victim really with no one to save her from Christian or HERSELF.  I don't need to get into the details.  Many other reviews give enough intel on her.<br /><br />About Christian...what has happened to some women in our society that they would actually want a man like Christian grey?!?!?!?  There are women who have reviewed this book that have stated they \\"want to find their christian grey\\".  Being a strong independent woman in her 30s...this baffles and saddens me.  He is an abusive, mentally disturbed, lunatic that should be in a padded cell.  Rich and handsome is not always sexy.  Christian is a dirtbag.  He is not a sexy man or an alpha hero...forget about romantic.  For me...Christian is the villain of the story.  I recently read a novella by Pamela Clare titled Skin Deep in which the hero is a ex-marine whose left side was disfigured from a bomb blast during war.  It was a sweet and sexy story (there is a dark side) with a message explained by the title and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Considering the rest of the reviews commented on the lack of editing, the repetitions in the writing and the juvenile writing style, there's nothing else to say about this.<br /><br />To those looking to read 50 shades...it's up to you.  Personally I don't understand the hype surrounding this series, but you're opinion may be different than mine.  Good luck.
B001TH16DI|2.0|First off, this would have been a great blu-ray edition had it not been converted to 7.1, not everyone can afford to buy a 7.1 receiver and speakers.  I find it infuriating it does not even support a 5.1 system.  There is no reason for this I have no trouble playing other blu rays through all 6 channels which is the purpose of a 5.1 system, why is it Star Trek ONLY supports 7.1 in the english language?!
076115728X|5.0|When I was in 2nd grade, my art teacher told me there are no mistakes in art; you use it to make something else you never would have known existed. I never forgot that. When I came across this book, I bought it for my 1 year old son. One, because it is one of the most beautiful books I've ever come across and two, because the lesson in it is so important for both children and adults. We can't waste time with regret. We must take what we've done, learn from those experiences, and make a more beautiful life because of them. Thank you, Mr. Saltzberg. My son, Finn, loves your book and has turned it into his own \\"Beautiful Oops\\" from playing with it so much. I figure it fits right into the theme and I cherish every ripped page.

0385344228|5.0|As an attorney and former prosecutor, I usually stay away from legal fiction.  I find there are few writers who get the legal angles right while still managing to keep the story interesting.  William Lanaday gets it right.  In fact, this is the best courtroom drama I've read since Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent (many years ago).  In this first person narrative, ADA Andy Barber lays out the legal aspects of the story realistically and in terms that the legal layman can easily understand.  At the same time this is a family drama.  Readers who are parents will ask themselves the question, \\"What would I do if my child was accused of a heinous crime?\\"  The novel is suspenseful to the very end.  Lots of great plot twists.

1451629192|5.0|Wow!  What a powerful book!  I was choked up with tears within the first few pages.<br /><br />The book is painful to read but nothing compares to the emotional and physical pain the author went through.  And when I was done and took time to reflect upon it, it became one of the most inspirational books I have read.<br /><br />My first impression into the first few pages was that it sounds like it's written by a little girl.  And that is the brutal truth - she was stolen of time for normal development and growth.  Her writing gets more mature as the book progresses and you can see that she is growing as she is writing the book.  Even her stories about her cats and other what seems to us boring or insignificant stories are about what her life was and was not.<br /><br />The most impressionable message I got out of the book is -strength that makes you overcome the life's unfairness defines who you are.<br /><br />We often think about forgiving and forgetting.  But what we need to focus on is refusing to let the negative in life take over any more moment of our lives than it already has.<br /><br />I will remember Jaycee as someone who has conquered.
B00466HM28|4.0|What can I say? My bag got stolen and with my LPD8 in it (another amazingly portable from Akai). I saw the MPK Mini in action at a friend's show.    I figured I'd splurge for the built-in keyboard. The pads are about 8/10 compared to an old (and very used) MPC. I've found myself using a midi plugin to filter all velocity inputs to +127. then I'll go back and manually edit the velocity.    The keyboard is a bit cramped, but it's still easy to play chords, if your fingers are a bit to pudgy or clumsy, you can always do some midi chord/note changing later.    All in all, it's a great starter unit, or a nice little portable unit to add to your laptop arsenal. If you need a basic midi controller/keyboard this is it, if you want something with a bit more umph, you might start looking at the mpk25 or better.    I use it in Ableton Live! (8.3+ has built-in automapping), Reason, Reaper, and Cubase.    I've used it with FL Studio, MixCraft, and a few others on friend's computers.    there are a few youtube vids out there that show it in action, and also will show you how to mod the pads for increased sensitivity (i have not tried this, and am not recommending it... it will void your warranty).    If also recommend glancing at the manual on the akai site ([...]) and make sure that you understand the basics of what you're getting into.    I saw some comments on other sites from people who bought one, then wondered why their \\"new synth\\" wasn't working right. folks, this is just a usb controller that sends midi to your software.

B00571F26Y|2.0|This is a typical Rodale Press book, filled with motivated \\"science.\\" Sorry to have bought it.<br /><br />One one star review began like this:\\"\\"Wheat Belly\\" by William Davis has some misleading information using unacceptable therories, antiquated unscientific studies, innuendos based on animal models (not human) and anecdotal experiences which collectively spoil the credibility of a book that could have been important and useful. As a result, I could never recommend the book to anyone even though the messages of carbohydrate control and restriction are good in all especially those with pre-diabetes, diabetes and obesity.\\"<br /><br />That is right on.<br /><br />Dr. Davis drives home the \\"bad wheat\\" message like Thor with a hammer; he fills it with technical information that is designed to be scary. And he may be right that our ubiquitous grain is harmful to most people. But he does not extend his censure of cereals to barley, rye, spelt, and oats, corn, sorghum, etc., etc., all of which contain glycoproteins like gluten and gliadin that are as potentially harmful. If you really want to learn all this food chemistry, genetics, and grain-evolution, it is all available on Wiki.<br /><br />This book will make a big splash with its pile of bagels and title with Belly in it. How many of us obese Americans don't have a hateful belly? And in so far as its propaganda might actually push people away from their high carb, supposedly grain-healthy diet, Dr. Davis's book may have a positive influence on health--however temporarily. For that reason alone, I give it two stars.

B004LWZWBU|4.0|Owen Wilson, Jack Black and Steve Martin star in this birding quest to identify the most species over a year's time. The competition is called The Big Year. Finding over 700 species takes them across the country and into various environments to which they flock with the enthusiasm of a hawk on a mouse. Owen Wilson's character, Bostick, is the previous year's winner and he wants to defend his record while the others are out to overtake his birding prowess. Extensive time away from home and family takes a toll on the birders and has Bostick's wife crying fowl. Nothing over the top happens in this film, just birders on a mission, yet, The Big Year strikes me as an undeclared salute to Audubon and I enjoyed it.
B0088TG252|3.0|This movie was OK.  That's about it.  Thankfully I rented the video and didn't make the purchase.  I don't think the acting was as good as it should have been, and the story could have been better.  I'm hoping there is not a sequel in the works...

B007RXRSEY|5.0|Slash has somehow managed to keep it going for over 25 years now.  Most people burn out by this point.  With his latest band, he yet again steps up to the plate and cranks it out of the park.  Apocalyptic Love, You're a Lie, Standing in the Sun, and We Will Roam are heavy standouts tracks from this album.  The other songs are great as well, those are just my personal favorites.  With the great Myles Kennedy on vocals, Slash has once again managed to snag one of the best voices in the business.  A credit to Myles, his lyrics explode from the first track and he doesn't stop until the last track. Not a lot of ballads on this (one song comes close). This is all about explosive energy, incredible guitar attack, and unforgettable solos.  Keep it up, oh top-hatted guitar god.

B004AQX0R0|5.0|This album is one of the greatest things that has ever been created by human beings.  If my house was burning down, I would grab the kid, this album, the woman and the cat in that order, before I ran out.  This particular version has 3 bonus tracks, sure, great.  The original was perfect, but now you get perfection plus more Pearl Jam, which is a no-brainer.  This album is so amazing, that the last time I listened to it, I cried tears of joy inspired by the art that is this masterpiece.  What is a perfect death?  Being surrounded by your loved ones as you slip into the void (or head into the light, whatever you believe) while listening to this album, just as the last few notes of \\"Release' are slowing fading from the stereo speakers.

B001E9641K|4.0|Fun to learn the Scandinavian nations while the board itself is beautifully illustrated. The game tends to end with a lot of random card draws, though, and feels more predictable--and less expansive--than Ticket to Ride. That's not enough to put me off, as I find the game almost meditative, but my girlfriend prefers the North American version without question. If it weren't up against the original, I imagine we'd both be pretty happy with it overall--but in this context, I give it one and a half thumbs up. :)

It takes you back from Alex Lifeson's and Geddy Lee's high school days and the evolution of the band to where they met and hired Neal Peart, the best drummer of my generation.<br /><br />Neal is literally a brainiac. A symphonic orchestra should have him narrate and play the drum parts of Peter And The Wolf By Prokofiev.<br /><br />I had no idea that the band took a long break because of Neal's wife and daughters death.<br /><br />So I don't spoil this, this is a very well done documentary by one of the most important bands in Rock History.<br /><br />Some of the extras take the bakery for me...like when they are eating dinner, getting hammered drinking wine and laughing like there's no tomorrow!!!<br /><br />RAY ST JOHN

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire, Book II, of the Hunger Games trilogy, is quite different than the initial novel. Of course, it's quite difficult to explain these differences, without giving away spoilers; and since the movie to Book II isn't out yet, I don't want to ruin any surprises for any future readers.<br /><br />The book begins much slower than Book I. There is little action or adventure. The first 2/3rds of the book are primarily hushed rumblings, and clandestine conversations, about \\"should we escape\\" or \\"ferment a revolution.\\" You get the usual back and forth. If we flee, we'll only save ourselves, and leave everyone else oppressed, if we stay and fight, we guarantee we'll die, and the chance of something greater - a successful revolution - is never in the odds of the revolutionary. Thus, do we concern ourselves with ourselves, or with the general public? Are we selfish, or do we, as Huey Newton would word it: commit revolutionary suicide. Amongst this backdrop of discussion is escalating oppression from the Capitol against the poor districts, and vague romantic sentiments that maybe a revolutionary underground exist, somewhere. Much like 1984, the reader is given the feeling that this underground is a fantasy to appease mental dissidents.<br /><br />For teenagers, this is a good introduction to the concepts of revolution, general will, self-sacrifice for the commons, and withdrawal. For a rabid Marxist like me, it's rather bland and banal. Though, I can't discredit the book for not appeasing me, it's meant for a different audience all together.<br /><br />All of the hushed plans and speculations of the main characters is quickly muted when political repression hits a climax, and Katniss, Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch, find themselves participating once again in the Hunger Games. This time their rivals are a whole different breed, and to call them rivals is contentious, without giving away too much.<br /><br />The Hunger Games, this time around, is a lot quicker. It almost feels forced. There's less player on player combat, and more player versus environment scenarios, which never relent, to the point of readers exhaustion; can't a man take a piss, and make a meal, without constantly leaving the last 1/3rd of the book in cliff hanger status!<br /><br />To elaborate on what happens in the arena would of course spoil quite a bit, all I can say is the ending was entirely unexpected, whose on whose side cannot be fathomed beforehand either. And the book does not resonate will a classical happy ending; which I appreciate. Moreover, the elements of class versus class conflict are permeating through the final third of the book, which should make any socialist happy. Overall, this was laudable sequel.els forced.

0439023513|4.0|I just finished book III of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I know right away that the book is subjectively good, because I have that feeling you get from only the best novels and/or series: sorrow that it's over, independent of the ending. There is no wiggle room left in the ending for a potential sequel; at least, not without Suzanne Collins being a complete huckster, and miser. And given her biting critique of materialistic society, and the degree to which the few will hold on to it, at the bloody cost of the many, I doubt she'd cave.<br /><br />As with the previous two books, little can be discussed without giving away serious spoilers. Literally all of the primary characters go through radical changes in personality, and physical composition. Members of the main cast will die off; even the ones you feel shouldn't die. Past relationships will become contentious, and violent, and differences in principles and politics will end in silence...or worse.<br /><br />In savage detail, book III takes the reader on a journey of how governments generate propaganda, how revolutions create their own, and the constant ensnaring of ideology and symbolism within and outside revolution. One cannot complete this series without having an iota of skepticism next time a politician, or news caster, `presents' an event `neutrally.'<br /><br />Issues of loyalty to the individual, or the revolution will come up constantly. Katniss, is no longer the strong, self-determined hero, of books I-II. She is most definitely used, and manipulated throughout this book, and is definitely one of the least cunning of the rebels. Moreover, it's clear from the first few pages that Katniss was never meant to be a revolutionary in general; her concerns have always been about Prim alone, and escaping district 12, not liberating it. For die hard Katniss fans than, prepare to lose your heroine as the bedrock of resistance.<br /><br />The action and suspense of this novel is the same as book II. Most of the I-Can't-Put-This-Down moments take place in the final 1/3rd. And that final 1/3rd is hardly close to predictable, if you're expecting a Hollywood/fairytale ending, where nothing goes wrong, and despite all impossible odds, everything is perfect. Thank god. That's not how revolutions work, and had Collins gone down that road, the ending would be a disappointment.<br /><br />The only minor quibbles I have this book are that the foundation of the revolutionary movement are hardly explained in any serious detail. book II ends with RUMORS of a resistance, and book III begins, the same day as book II ends, with a full blow revolution in already in progress. Arms, food, resources, medical staff, and strategy, along with extreme loyalties are already in place. Moreover, the revolutionary leader - Coin - is never really discussed. She has maybe 5 pages worth of scenes, it's never mentioned how she became leader, what her vision is (this is speculated on, but never made explicit), nor anything about her background. Given the fate of Coin, it would have been to have some of these issues cleared up. Also, I'm surprised this passed for teenage fiction, given the gore and violence of this novel. If anyone thought book I and II were too graphic for teens, I wonder how they're going to stay accurate to book III in the theaters, without giving this an R rating... I imagine some serious compromise will take place that ruins the integrity of the book, for viewership of the film. I digress.<br /><br />There's only one question the reader is left to ask themselves, at the end of book three, with all its horror, all its war, all its revolution, all the innocents and guilty dead: Is a revolution worth fighting for, if those you love the most, very well may die in the process? At certain moments in history, and under certain circumstances, it's easy to answer no, of course. But, when the sparks of revolution have become unconstrained wildfires, where no one can come out unscathed, and neutral, you better have an answer; at least Collins is essentially posing this question to the reader. Maybe we won't live to see the day this question is seriously asked, but maybe if people take this book seriously, we will.<br /><br />I'm glad Collins wrote these books, and I'm glad she wrote it for the perfect audience: teenagers, not yet fully tainted by the world of exploitation, greed, and misery, that awaits them, where their labor feeds the capital, and their only reprieve is television that reminds them simultaneously: things could be worse, but they could be better too.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I dearly love law enforcement movies.  They always get the bad guy. My dad was a chief of police and I have a nephew that followed in his footsteps that just retired as Chief of Police of Shively Police Department in Shivley, Kentucky.  I have a great newphew that just finished the academy and is employed in Indiana as a cadet. I just really get into law, FBI, criminal minds, and as you know my favorite is NCIS with Mark Harmons team. I had collected all the seasons and couldn't find the 4th season and was telling this friend of mind.  She knows how I am about purchasing on the internet. I have heard so many tells I just wouldn't never do it. She was telling me she orders from Amazon.Com all time and has never had a problem.  I know she always tells me the truth.  So, I got on there and ordered the 4th season, received it in like three days and didn't even have to pay shipping. (Lucky day) Then I received an e-mail from you and ask me if I wanted to pre order the 10th season so I did.  It will be out this month. I really trust your company and love the way you keep us informed on the movies you know we like. As for Mark Harmon and his team, I don't know which one I like the best. It takes all of them to make it work and they are so good in the parts they play. I could talk all day about NCIS, I just don't have any negative thing to say about them.  Thanks.
0439023521|4.0|Hunger Games is the first of the trendy trinity (Harry Potter, and Twilight), that I decided to read. I had no idea what the story was, and was informed by a friend that it was Dystopian - and not absolute fairy tale escapism like the previous mentioned books - and the movie was fantastic. I chose to see the movie with some friends, and was impressed enough to purchase the book.<br /><br />First of all, this book deserves serious credit for extrapolating into the future just how limitless our puerile desire for `reality TV' will take us. First contestants merely quizzed each other for money to entertain us (The Newly Wed Game, Family Feud, etc). Then they began to kick and punch each other (WWF). Now they frequently humiliate themselves into a point of no dignity (Every reality show presently out). And in the future, they will kill each other.<br /><br />Of course in order to coerce 28 people into killing each other, you need an omnipresent and oppressive state, which brutalizes the lives of the poor, and keeps them separated in their division of labor from meeting and communicating with others. Although this is a sci-fi novel, it does take place in America, and it's not entirely improbable to envision the descriptions of each poor district as the future description of each actual American district.<br /><br />This is ultimately the world of Panem: America after another civil war, where the poor lose, and the rich choose to humiliate them, and defile their dignity, by making 2 members of each district fight to the death on live television. Of course, the state is careful to propagandize this point as a rewarding tradition, which bestows honor and glory on the winners, and reminds the poor of why they need the Capitol in the first place.<br /><br />For a novel aimed at teenagers I like the message, and the implication. This is certainly a superior choice for a teenager, over 1984, or Animal Farm, whose implicit USSR references would be totally lost on our youth; moreover, those novels fail to criticize the trajectory of American, and only the former trajectory of a different failed state.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this book still only warrants four stars for several reasons. One, the movie, which was written by the author, offers a narrative that isn't entirely 1st person, in the main characters head, and I think ultimately this broadened the available options of exploring Panem, and different districts (The revolt in district 11 in the film could not happen in the book). Second, it is clearly written for teenagers, and I'm not the target audience. Only so much satisfaction can be derived from reading extremely simple prose, and teenage relational sentiments, where kissing and holding hands are momentous events in a post-puberty state of being.<br /><br />Finally, I have a reactionary grievance that's two sided... First, when I hear people in the theater or in the book store talking about this book, all I here is the same old banal tripe: \\"It's so good.\\" \\"I loved it.\\" Nothing about the actual critique of the American state, environmental, and welfare policy, or the NEED to revolt against those who exploit economically, and psychology. Comments on state based ideology are entirely lacking, and I sincerely doubt reality TV viewership has taken a hit. Instead, this novel aimed at teens, with a serious message, is being consumed by adults, with the reading comprehension level, and moral integrity, of a grapefruit. Second, I suppose that's why the three biggest hits (Harry Potter, Twilight) are aimed at kids, yet sweep our countries, and in general must contain a sci-fi escapism element, just to rouse people away from the TV or the People Magazine, in order to give reading `another try.'<br /><br />I realize these are not directly criticisms that should detract from my review of the content of the book, but I couldn't help feeling this constant annoyance while reading that: the content is being lost, like all popular rebellion in capitalism, the message and content are commoditized and drained of their non-exchange-value (Think everything John Lennon ever wrote solo). Rebellion is consumption, consumption is rebellion, and soon we'll be consuming the cable channels that air the deaths of our community, if we aren't careful.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is one of the most fantastic movies I've seen! You really get a good look at some of the things law enforcement goes through and then to try to be the best husband and father also in this day and time does take courage.

Do people even think before they make such a movie? I would be extremely embarrassed to even act in it. Outraging!
B00005QGAV|5.0|all the jackson´s magic, creativity, passion and power is in this brilliant album. Give special attention to \\"give into me\\", \\"who is it\\" and \\"in the closet\\". Probably the best of Jackson´s carreer.
B008OJ8BM8|4.0|There really isn't much to say about this album other than it's a great compilation of what I personally consider to be some of Slipknot's best songs. You can't really rate this as you would a full release so I gave this an overall rating of how I view the band and it's progression over the years.<br /><br />Slipknot is far from a perfect band. A perfect band, to me, is a band that has found their sound and is comfortable within it. Slipknot is a band that is still trying to fit other molds whether that be Heavy Rock, Thrash, or anything in between. Even recently there were rumors (I haven't read the \\"source\\" myself) of Slipknot confessing their new album to be more like one of their past albums: IOWA. Maybe they've finally found their identity in the music world? Only time will tell.<br /><br />In my opinion their greatest strengths have been rebellious lyrics, obscure riffs/sound effects(which add an illusion of \\"heavyness\\"), and the lead singer's voice. Not to mention their ability to write some insanely catchy radio-friendly songs. This, however, can only last so long. I have to admit though - while Slipknot is not in my top 10 Metal bands list, they're definitely my first go-to band amongst guilty pleasures.<br /><br />This would be a great album to buy if you want to see what Slipknot has been all about through their growth without having to buy every album they've released. I recommend it to any Metal-head who isn't afraid to be wrongfully stereotyped as having bad taste in music. Cheers!

B00846REIS|2.0|I too was looking for something to follow up from '50 Shades of Grey' ( I read the trilogy 3 times) and saw this book at the local Chapter's store.  I didn't buy it then but bought it last night for Kindle.  I must say that I was really very disappointed.  I found it to be a poor copy of 50 Shades (which is what some other reviews have said);it was much more abrupt at every turn and quite honestly, not very arousing at all.

That's right, the word \\"null\\" in parentheses is part of the title of the ebook.<br /><br />So, you'll be reading along and come to something like \\"see the chart on page 22.\\" Well of course in an ebook there are no page numbers and the reference is not linked either. When you eventually find the chart in question, which in the print edition is a nicely formatted table, you will find just text. That is, each row of the table is a paragraph of text. It is really difficult to grasp the intent of the table without the proper formatting.<br /><br />I didn't understand the source of my frustration until I saw a copy of the paperback edition. If I had realized it sooner I would have returned the kindle book. However Amazon will only allow returns of kindle books within seven days.<br /><br />I have browsed sample chapters from other eBook sellers and found the same sloppy formatting. So<br />I'm sure the fault is with the publisher, William Morrow, and not with Amazon.

B008KRJWEK|4.0|This gems is a lot like &quot;Zombie Highway&quot; and &quot;Temple Run&quot; but mashed together to make a good solid game. I gave it four stars because I feel that you should be able to upgrade vehicles with guns and armour and then have to collect ammo and also have the choice when to fire your weapon's. Also it has froze up my Kindle Fire once but still this is a terrific way to waste some zombie and some time.
0425263908|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it was the first one I've read by Sylvia Day.  I would recommend it to those who enjoyed the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I am just getting started reading the romance type books and have enjoyed all of them so far.  I have seen a pattern in the books as they seem to always have messed up people who can't accept who they are trying to have a relationship and expect by finding someone to love they(their lover)  will fix the problems in their lives, but this is why they are fiction.  I look forward to reading more books by Sylvia Day and continue to look for more authors to enjoy reading.
0307592731|2.0|I love to hike and hoped this would be as good as all the reviews. It wasn't! The author was whiny and annoying. I read the whole book and just could not like the author or care about her journey. She was incredibly stupid and it is a wonder she made it considering all the dumb things she did.  It was a big disappointment!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I just finished this book last night. I was dragging through the overly described scenes because I thought perhaps that would be an interesting twist at the end. Instead I was sadly mistaken. This book was not a suspense thriller in my opinion. It was a book about a bored, spoiled, very clever, hateful woman who hurt innocent people when when she didn't get what she wanted. The husband is a depressed, angry, unemployed man who takes everything out on the rest of the world instead of dealing with his own issues. I was very disappointed at the way the author stereotyped not only Midwesterners and New Yorkers, but also the 30-40 year olds. I happen to be 35 years old and I am definitely not as dumb and hateful as \\"Amy\\" claims all women are.<br /><br />I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on this book. I wish I could demand a refund from Amazon.
0525478817|5.0|Despite being a tear-jerker, this was an amazing book. John Green nailed the narrator's voice perfectly (as well as the other characters' voices). At times, I wanted to put the book down because I knew what was coming, but I couldn't. Read the whole thing in one sitting (and yes, cried a lot). One of the best books I've read in a while....funny, sad, poignant, hopeful.

B004XWLN20|5.0|The show of Smallville has taken many twist and turns along the way. Finally ending at what has been called, of the of  best Series finale's of all time. PAUSE right there, no. Just no. The series finale was good, it was fine and dandy. But in the era of season or two long story lines, to go episode to episode and wrap with a three episode story arch really pissed me off. But, in all fairness, I LOVE this show. There were a few bumps along the road, but when you get into the later seasons you start to really see what punches they were able to get away with throwing. The Justice episodes were by far my best, and the Green Arrow is epic. The box set is nearly 9 Lbs. For real, this is the heaviest box set I own and it is all because of the enormous packaging. Only putting two disks per page on card stock is going to weigh things down a little. But you also get a Daily Planet newspaper and episode guide. With the set FULL of pictures and scenes, you slip wondering where is my red and blue suit? At the very end? Nope, there is no Superman shot here, which is nice because the focus was never on who he becomes but who he is now (until the final season). Follow Clark and the gang as they grow up and save the world at the same time.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|So Redshirts is here, the latest novel by John Scalzi.  It's got it's good times and bad times, but overall I enjoyed the book.  There are some flaws however, that keep this book from getting a higher rating.  Basically, the book follows Andrew Dahl and a few other Ensigns aboard the Intrepid, where ensigns on an away mission have a tendancy to die...basically on every away mission.  As the plot unfolds there are some genuinely good twists here, but for the most part, it's pretty straight forward, the book is fairly short, and moves at a brisk pace, something I feel the book benefits from greatly.  The humor is there, however, I didn't particularly care for the main characters in this book, they seemed like general characterizations of people for the most part.  Aside from characters that are just so-so, my other issue with the book are the 3 coda's at the end.  I get that it tells more of the story and gives closure to certain people that were effected by the plot of the book, but arent the main characters.  There are even genuine, heart touching moments in the codas, but the fact that each coda is centered on 3 different characters who were only in the book at the very end makes them disappointing.  When reading each coda, to be honest i was just wondering if it was going to end soon, the saving grace of it is that Scalzi masterfully ended each coda with touching moments.  I also felt that Scalzi ended the main book quite nicely as well.  I would recommend this book to sci-fi fans and to Scalzi fans, just don't go expecting his best book yet. If it werent for the dry characters and the so-so codas I'd have given this 4 stars, maybe even five.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I would like to give this book a 3.5. It has flashes of brilliance, and a very unusual premise. However, it suffers from inconsistent pacing that prevents it from becoming a compelling read.<br /><br />Wool is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel about the residents of the Silo, a vertical shaft that takes days to climb up and down.<br /><br />The Silo is divided up into layers by function, with administration and the Sheriff at the top, IT in the middle, and maintenance & supply at the bottom. Gardens, apartments and other functions are spread out across the silo.<br /><br />The enviroment outside the Silo is toxic - so toxic, in fact, that there is no way for citizens to go in and out. Environment suits are eaten away by the caustic atmosphere, and death happens after a short time.<br /><br />Because of this, being sent to \\"Cleaning\\" is the capital punishment of the colony. In addition to severe crimes that we recognize, like murder, one can be sentenced to cleaning for breaking Silo taboos, the most serious of which is wanting to go outside.<br /><br />The book centers around Juliette, a maintenance \\"greaser\\" who is tapped to take over the office of Sheriff after the old sheriff is sentenced to cleaning. As she and her friends become more deeply embroiled in the functioning of the Silo, they start to learn what's really going on. Their reactions to it drive the plot, and the future of the Silo.

0765367351|1.0|**Mild Spoilers and Mild Language**<br /><br />I can't believe it has taken me so long to finally post this review. Oh well, better late than never.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Bioshock, a HUGE fan. If you call yourself a fan or a love for literature, I recommend staying AWAY from this book.<br /><br />John Shirley's writing is, in short, flat-out horrible. It is an eye-rolling adventure as he viciously tore away at any logic or eloquence that was vastly possible with the given synopsis, but he fully ignores it.<br />Instead he chooses to hack away at these faulty plots as it abuses and shreds holes into the original canon storyline(s) presented in the game(s). On top of which, it is sickeningly obvious where he attempts to squeeze in lines directly taken from the audio diaries that are found in the game and sorely attempts to makes these into actual conversations, rather than recordings. Perhaps if he were better at writing, this may not have been such an issue, but the well-written scripts and presentations of the audio diaries is much, much different than the stumbling dribble Shirley has. Not to mention the horrible way he sets them up, to make it look as though what is contained and written as a personal audio diary is a response to a conversation. There is no possible way to make this sound logical, and it ends up making the characters' dialogue seem disgustingly contrived, unoriginal, and boring.<br /><br />The plot itself is also fairly lackluster. Originally I was very, very excited for this book and had even pre-ordered it nearly a year in advance, and while I certainly wasn't expecting it to be perfect (as novelizations of video games never are), I certainly wasn't expecting a 5th Grade Level of writing with a sorry, poor attempt at a College-Level content. I very honestly tried to remain optimistic throughout, however in the end I closed this book with an extremely dissatisfied sigh of annoyance.<br /><br />To go into more detail, yet still wrap this up in a timely fashion, let's take a look at only a few of the worst character bastardizations.<br /><br />Frank Fontaine.<br /><br />  The only good thing that came from the horribly written character was that I now have MUCH more appreciation for the original Fontaine, the one that was presented in the first and second games in the Bioshock series. Now, to begin. It's shown early on that Frank Fontaine is a conman and attempts to show how wonderfully cunning and snide he is. It fails. One of his prime moments is donning a freaking false mustache and shoving a pillow under his shirt and passing as a truck driver in an attempt to get close to the suspicious shipments he'd seen being sent overseas to an unknown location. The top off this clich&eacute; image of the classic \\"disguise,\\" he even wears false glasses. I was able to slightly look past this, however this was the real kicker that made me pretty much toss the book in disappointment for several days.<br />Rather than working around the countless possibilities of how Fontaine could've made his way to Rapture, Shirley goes with the idea that he steals the identity of a man who owns a fishery that is set to go to Rapture. This is all well and fine, except it is absolute coincidence that apparently this man's name is \\"Frank Fontaine\\" and has a striking resemblance to our antagonist, Frank Fontaine. So all our antag has to do you kill the guy, on his own boat, with his own men boarding it, and toss his body over the end. Done! Suddenly, Frank Fontaine has become... Frank Fontaine! None of the fisherman's men know anything amiss, because the two men looked so alike to begin with, nor does anyone seem to care that the real guy's floating in the bay.<br />Really? REALLY?<br /><br />Sander Cohen<br /><br />  I realize that Cohen was ultimately a minor character, though he had many ties to Andrew Ryan and therefore had a few scenes in the novel, and is of course a very loved character by man fans of the game. Sander Cohenwas originally described as an artist, a very eccentric artist, but still a passionate gentlemen. In the book, Sander Cohen is only eccentric. No, he is beyond eccentric. Apparently Mr. Cohen was completely bat-crapping insane and drastically overused sloppy applications of makeup prior to ever setting foot in Rapture. He is described by Bill McDonagh as his entire essence seemed askew (obviously it was not described like this in sic, but you should see what I'm getting at). I find this fairly... off, since there are many clues given in-game that Cohen may have once been very refined, and his overuse of makeup came from the fact that ADAM had changed his facial features to a much less-than-desirable appearance. It's heavily support in-game by many audio diaries that this occurred to many otherwise prominent figures. If anything, the fact that the game was able to convey and present the degeneration of a person's mind because of the effects of ADAM was one of the best highlights to the game itself.<br />You may take this either way you choose, however I personally chalked this up to yet another negative.<br /><br />Brigid Tenenbaum<br /><br />  Tenenbaum had so much potential. She was such a fantastic character in the games, with lovely character development, I told myself that she could just about save this train wreck. I don't know where I got such hope, since I should've expected this.<br />Tenenbaum's dialogue is basically a mishmash of lines taken from her audio diaries from the game. I don't believe she had a single original line that wasn't, at the very least, a heavy reference to her in-game dialogue.<br /> She has next to zero characterization, and the added development she is given is stale and, surprise-surprise, pretty much sexualized. Yup. In-game, due to the heavy business relationship Tenenbaum had with Fontaine and the fact that their said business was illegal and therefore very hush-hush, it became a widespread rumor that Fontaine and Tenenbaum werepossibly in a relationship.<br />The author took this, the smallest detail that was exposed in an audio diary of a dead otherwise no-name journalist, to as extreme as he could.<br />Because you know if you have a book and you have a female character who interacts heavily with a male character, you just GOT to have a relationship from that! Or at least some sex.<br />Yes, that's right. Tenenbaum and Fontaine were, apparently, in a sexual relationship. I don't know about anyone else, but this was pretty ridiculous to me. Not to mention completely, absolutely unneeded. It did not help the plot or story in absolutely anyway and honestly was just a horribly desperate attempt to add some sort of perverse \\"sexiness\\" to a story that did not call for it.<br />Basically, Tenenbaum's character development was traded for a bizarre romantic relationship.<br /><br />And finally, we come to Yi Suchong and Andrew Ryan.<br /><br />Suchong was also given as little and simple development as possible. End of story. His lines were taken from audio diaries and the overuse of the trait he had in speaking in third-person was so grossly overused, one might've thought Suchong was intended to be a savant rather than an actual scientist.<br /><br />Andrew Ryan was also a disappointment. I don't have much to say on his matter, except that this was all heavily influenced by the strictly terrible writing. Had it been written well, his character may had been just fine save for the weird god-complex he developed so early on. Same goes for other major character(in the book), Bill McDonagh. He was expressed as being a smart man in-game though we never met him, while in the book it seemed like a bumbling plumber who worshipped the ground Mr. Ryan walked on, only to suddenly within a single chapter turn on that.<br /><br />So, overall, I do not recommend this book unless you're a fan of over-publicized, poorly written fanfiction. Even then, fanfiction is miles better than this.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book could have been left out of the series all together.  It didn't add much to the series, I'm a bit disappointed because I was hoping for a more grown up version of Christian and Anna.

Christian had that, please save me feel that I lot of readers might like.  Not me, I like my men already finished.  Anna was naive and too young for what was happening to her. Again, an okay read.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|thought by paying the jacked up price for this app I would get better service but nothing could be farther from the truth.  kindle users get updates last and the last one erased all the progress made in the game.

You can buy all previous versions of this game for $3 and have angry bird excitement for weeks or get this one and be done in an hour with no hope of more enjoyment without paying more money.

B005LAII3U|4.0|I just got back from the Midnight showing of this movie and I have to say that I was actually quite impressed with the storyline as it differed just enough from the original to make the film very entertaining, yet didn't seem to be a complete re-hash of the original [[ASIN:B00827OX56 Total Recall]] starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course the special effects were much better than the original film, but I have to admit that Arnold has such a presence that it makes it very hard to compete against him. Especially when you are playing the part he played so well in the original. However, Colin Farrel does do a good job playing the role of Douglas Quaid, or is it Hauser. I'm not really sure and that is the point of the movie. The cast is rounded out with Bryan Cranston from [[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season]] fame reprising the role originally played by veteran actor Ronny Cox and Jessica Biel as Hauser's love interest Melina played by Rachel Ticotin in the original film, and Bokeem Woodbine as Quaid's friend Harry.<br /><br />Now there are some obvious differences between the two films and without giving away in major spoilers, I am going to share a few of them with you here. So don't continue reading if you don't want to know some key plot elements in this new film.<br /><br />1. Sharon Stone's role from the original film is played devilishly and deliciously by Kate Beckinsale of the [[ASIN:B007FFUMKQ Underworld: The Legacy Collection]] films and plays her character all the way through the entire film up until the very end. Her character in this film is actually a combination of two characters from the original film. Of course as I already stated Sharon Stone's original role, but also the role of Michael Ironside as Richter in the original film. I thought this was a nicely added touch and I am sure you will as well. Beckinsale really gives her role some real viciousness as it seems only a female can.<br /><br />2. There is no relevance with the planet Mars in this version. All the events take place in what was once known as Europe and Australia.<br /><br />3. There are no \\"mutants\\" of any kind really shown or implied in the film. Well of course there is one, but when you see her you'll wish you had three hands.<br /><br />In order to fully enjoy this film, you really need to kind of forget about the original and just sit back and enjoy this film for what it is.

B0047E6LW6|5.0|What is generically called \\"metal\\" has an interesting history. It boasts a lot of variety and talent under its banner. You wouldn't really know it by today's sound, but metal built itself on melody and mood. From pioneers such as Zeppelin and Sabbath to some of the later acts that popularized the genre name like Metallica, the sound of metal boasted a full palette of atmospheres and emotions to go along with its trademark aggressive drive and rhythm.<br /><br />I think when Pantera came along, a lot of that began to die. Much of the melody began to be shed for more 'chunk' and more aggression. In today's army of Dean slinging, buzz-saw Dimebag acolytes...to hear a band so masterfully bring back some of that shadowy, melodic sound is a real breath of fresh air. I don't know who Ghost are. More or less, I stumbled across this album looking for new heavy sounds. It didn't grab me at first. The brazenly clean vocals and harmonies on this album catch you off guard, but they prove powerful the more you listen. This band are pros. Their grasp of harmony, rhythm changes and their use of atonality speaks to a group of musicians that have been around the block more times than their debut album here might indicate. Sure, there are some very clear nods to the likes of Mercyful Fate and others, but it's done with the heart of an artist rather than a parrot. These guys take sounds, pay tribute to them and then take them higher.<br /><br />I suspect this is probably a side project for most if not all of these guys. They are too good to be a one album outfit. However, the upside with this group is immense. There is a really amazing amount of talent collected here and a wonderful direction. The black spots have all been thoroughly explored. These guys are working in the grayer shadows, and I'm excited about what they have made happen and COULD make happen more than the majority of heavy music I've heard in the last twenty years. Pay attention. These guys wear the costumes and have fun, but they're a solid group of players. They've offered up a wonderful album here, and their next has the potential to really be something special.

He has the swagger to pull it up, but was kind of shallow....dry forced humor.

1609611543|2.0|Having read books over the last 15 years by other low carb advocates, there is really nothing new in this book. If you are expecting to discover a secret formula that allows you to forego wheat products and substitute, calorie-for-calorie, 'gluten free' packaged,processed ersatz goodies, ice cream, bacon and snickers bars, you might as well read \\"Life Without Bread: How a Low-Carbohydrate Diet Can Save Your Life by Christian B. Allan and Wolfgang Lutz (Jul 1, 2000)\\" ...you don't have to slog through quite as many pages to reach the same conclusion. Lets just say aside from virtually eliminating calorically dense carbs (including but not limited to glutenous grains), you have to portion control everything except fibrous vegetables,raw nuts, and water.<br /><br />Would people (in general) be better off without eating Big-Agra processed wheat/corn/soy products (including the meat, eggs and milk of the animals that have been force fed this diet)? Yes. Is Big Agra/Big Pharma complicit with Big Government in encouraging high starchy-carb consumption? Certainly seems that way. Have diabetics been mislead over the years about appropriate macronutrient balance? Yes. Is the unprecedented rate of obesity and diabetes in this country due to over-consumption of naturally occurring saturated fats? No.<br /><br />On the other hand, are a majority of people willing to forego tasty convenience foods and consume significantly fewer calories to improve their BMI and general health? No.<br /><br />If you like to read bio-chem oriented theories involving specific macro and micro nutrients, there are some interesting chapters...particularly the one about PH balance.

1612130283|1.0|My GF bought this book because her friends did and whenever she was reading it she was laughing hysterically. She said I had to read it because it was hilariously bad. I did not find it funny, more disturbing that drivel like this can get on the bestsellers list. I weep for humanity. Seriously, the \\"what I did last summer essay\\" I wrote in third grade was better than this \\"book\\". Whoever the editor was (if there was indeed an editor)should be thrown in a fiery pit, how hard it it to look at a map and at least get the geography right? Going through Portland from Seattle to get to Vancouver. What!!!?? If you want smut go watch some cheesy 70s porn, there is more character development in a 3 minute sex shoot than in this entire piece of trash. Although, all that being said, there may be a practical use for it. I have sent a letter to Obama recommending that waterboarding at Gitmo be replaced with forcing prisoners to listen to an audio recording of this book. They wont be able to stand the first ten pages without confessing.

After buying it and reading on, it turned out to be complete smut, I should've read more feedback. Very disappointed, the free sample is just long enough to leave the dirt out; not my genre. Please save yourself, I'm not scarred for life but it isn't pleasant, AND I want my money back!
0345803485|4.0|I was going to order this book and read it, because i kept hearing about it on talk shows, radio shows, magazine reviews and it's on the NY Times best seller list.  Thanks to all after reading your reviews....\\"NO THANKS\\" for ordering \\"Fifty Shade of Grey\\", the consensus is this book is \\"poorly written\\" \\"characters don't mesh\\" and \\"no plot.\\"  Most of these reviews are funny and probably more exciting to read than \\"Fifty Shades\\", lol.

B000OCXIDK|5.0|I just loved this wonderful little piece of fiction. It took us right to mid sixteen hundred's Delft, Holland. Were the painters guild resides (St.Luke's) and other master painters of that time period resided i.e.; Johann Vermeer and Rembrandt were two and there were more all competing for money for their work from rich patrons.<br />I love historical novels if they are done well. This writer takes you there to Delft and, tells the story of an ordinary girl,\\"Griet\\", who is sixteen years old and, has to grow-up quickly due to her fathers losing his place in a shop that paints tiles when he becomes blinded by a kiln accident at work he was also a member of the guild. Griet now has to go out an earn an income to help support the family as well as her brother.<br />  Griet has to learn a lot as she goes to a strange house. One filled with too many children to count. A wife,\\"Catharina\\", who is narcissistic and thinks her status is more than it is and, she is perpetually pregnant. The mother-in-law to Vermeer, \\"Maria Thins\\", who for the most part runs the career and finances of the home and of Johann Vermeer. The surly daughter \\"Cornelia\\" who is very mean, manipulative,and jealous concerning Griet the \\"new maid\\". Then Tanneke the well seasoned other maid who shows her the ropes and tells her the house gossip.  Griet now lives in a home that follows a different religion then her own as she is Protestant and the Vermeer's are Catholic as Griet's mother tells her \\"to hold her ears during their Catholic prays!\\"<br />  What absolutely drew me to the book was the beautiful girl with a large pearl earring that seemed to glow for that time period. At that time I did not know a lot about Vermeer's work. I do now! The photo/portrait just really pulled me in! Every time I went past the book I was fascinated finally I got my wallet out. I have read this book twice. The second time after several years I got more out of it then the first time. I now look at that portrait and think of Griet the simple little 16 yr. old servant girl who couldn't read as stated by Catharina Vermeer. Griet had a bright, clever, mind. Which Johann Vermeer saw in her. Griet made out better then the Vermeer's in the long run. Although, she was sexually curious about \\"Master Vermeer\\" she ended up with someone that was not duty bound to have all those children as dictated by the dogma of an earlier Catholic church. Griet has a good husband, a couple of children and they work together in a business. I think she was duty bound to her heart and mind!  There is a lot more to this book but, I don't want it to be spoiler alert. If you are a mystery person or action thriller this book is not for you. This book is a historical novel and the characters are more introspective.riet the simple little 16 yr. old servant girl who couldn't read as stated by Catharina Vermeer.

B005UBNL0A|5.0|At first I was unsure if I should buy it because of all the bad reviews saying it was a bad processor when it first came out.I ignored the reviews and bought and so far it is a good processor. I so no difference between a fx-4100 and i3 2100 , the i3 2100 might be faster ,but not by much.3.6ghz factory clocked is fast enough for me.It works great and well worth the money. The stock fan keeps the processor under 45 degrees.No regrets buying this processor.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|This aVia Media Player adds much needed \\"one stop\\" management capabilities to my Kindle Fire and HTC EVO 4G. I originally downloaded this to find pictures from my security cameras that the app stored in a non-standard location, and it worked as hoped, but continue to use it for both pictures and video. The app also supports music on the device, but the [[ASIN:B004FRX0MY Amazon MP3]] player works fine for my needs. The app also has a very intuitive, nice looking interface with easy to understand instructions.<br /><br />This is great free app that works better than expected!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B008QYT7DI|1.0|I love the book so please understand this is only a review of the limitations of the Kindle version of The Little Prince. I just purchased/downloaded the Kindle version of The Little Prince. Unfortunately I also just returned it.<br /><br />The Kindle version has two serious limitations. First, you cannot adjust the font size, which is a feature I like and have been able to adjust on every other book I have gotten for my Kindle. Second, you cannot highlight any of the text, which is another feature I have gotten very used to with all my other Kindle books. For these reasons I have returned it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|That such an excellent book is available only digitally and inexpensively is a warning to all publishers: get out of the way!  I stumbled across this book based on the Amazon reviews only, hope he garners more attention soon.  Can't wait for the sequel and will happily pay more.  Don't give in Mr Anthony, publish all your works this way and you will blaze a trail to the future of media distribution.
B005L38QK2|3.0|It worked great with Lion 10.7 for Mac, but now that 10.8 is out, the driver is broken. Apple removed the X11 programming language that the driver was based on. Still waiting for a new driver. Right and Left mouse buttons work, but that is about it.<br /><br />Solid when it did work.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|When I first discovered Baroness, I knew I had found something special.  It started with the Red Album, which captured my attention in such a way I could not get it out of my head.  I quickly acquired it and the previous EPs, and those recordings are deeply a part of my life's soundtrack.  They are so much more than just \\"doom metal\\"; for me it was easy to see that this was a band who thought and performed outside the box, and I knew they would eventually evolve into even greater things.<br />Now, as if Blue Record didn't prove that enough, Yellow and Green shows Baroness' creativity positively exploding.  Granted, the introduction of keyboards and greater percentage of accoustic material will prove to be off-putting to some long-time fans.  It's even tempting to look at the album's first single, Take My Bones Away, as a move in a more commercial direction, what with its more Nu Metal asthetic.  Admittedly, it threw me at first.  But a second spin of this highly important entry into Baroness' catalog was enough to reveal great intricacy.  This may not be the headbanging festival of the previous recordings, but it most certainly is NOT mainstream, commercialized schlock.  Far from it.  The lyrics, the arrangements, the effects-- these all bear the stamp of a no-compromise indie band.  If anything, Baroness is simply allowing the more progressive and alt-metal side of their nature to have dominance.  In fact, I venture to say that Yellow and Green is their most progressive album to date.  Their are things here that remind me-- just a tad-- of The Mars Volta.  The alt-metal aspect is quite strong, too, and quite a bit of this harkens to Jane's Addiction and Saigon Kick (sans \\"Love Is On the Way\\", please).  There's even a touch of cow punk and Meat Puppets-like harmonies and structures.  But in all of this, never does the album lose sight of the fact that this is Baroness, loud and clear.<br />The first disk (Yellow) has the lion's share of the rockers.  But we hear less of a wall of sound on most of them than is typical, more minimalistic arrangements in which base lines, tastefully effected guitars and even a bit of keyboards are allowed clean, clearly heard moments.  \\"Little Thing\\" even makes effective use of a ringing 12-string guitar.  It's positively beautiful.  Yellow ends with an emotional conclusion in \\"Eula\\", which will leave you absolutely entranced for long after the song ends.  Disk Two (Green) is far more subdued, featuring mostly gorgeous, atmospheric pieces, sandwiched between what are now two of my favorite rockers from Baroness: \\"Board Up the House\\" and \\"The Line Between\\".  This second disk is the most unexptected thing from Baroness, who have before this issued albums that are 90 to 100% heavy.  But not to fear; as I said earlier, there is nothing \\"sell out\\" about this highly creative and artistic music.  And did I mention John Dyre Baizley's art in the beautiful booklet?  Not only the bizarre cover, but the eerie yet moving black and white sketch-type work within.  It's worth getting the physical product just to have that without having to stare at it through a screen.<br />I could go on and on detailing why each song is an incredible part of a brilliant whole, but words just wouldn't do it justice.  You have to hear it to believe it, and if you don't get it on the first listen, try again, listen more closely, and notice those more subtle features that are what make Baroness great.  This is the kind of creativity and progression I recognized in them from the very beginning.  It's music that speaks to one's very soul and lifts us up even when presenting its darkest themes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this app is the best its so fun and the the tittle don't lie there's 101 games to play all super fun and great for passing time and its free get it u will love it

0307730697|4.0|I never served in the military myself, but I have great respect for those men & women that do.  Even greater respect for those that have served in times past.  Maybe it's because of the stories my father & uncles shared with me over the years.  Stories from the Vietnam War, The Korean Conflict, and even back the WW II.  I also love stories about those individuals that overcome impossible odds to live extremely successful lives.  Not success in a worldly sense necessarily.  But success all the same.  Eric Blehm captures both of these in his book \\"Fearless.\\"<br />\\"Fearless\\" tells the life story of Adam Brown.  Adam was a small town boy with dreams like any other boy from the south.  He was athletic, popular, and friendly to every one he ever met.  Adam was the kid that everybody knew and liked.  However, one poor choice as a young adult sent his life in a downward spiral.  Before he knew it, Adam was addicted to crack and was destroying his life as well his relationships with those he loved and loved him.  At his darkest moment, Adam's parents called the police to have him arrested...which as it turns out...began the process of turning his life around.<br />Through a series of events, Adam Brown met and gave his heart and life to Jesus.  He met and married the love of his life.  And he enlisted into the United States Navy.  Adam has an attitude and desire that simply will not quit.  Being in the Navy was not enough for Adam.  His dream is to become a Navy Seal.  The Navy Seals are the most elite of all special ops units.  They are the best of the best.  Training to become a Seal takes more than two years and only about 20% of all that sign up complete the training.<br />The story of Adams life continues to grow and evolve.  He continues to struggle with and face his demons.  Sometimes losing and giving in.  But never giving up.  It reminds me that even though the demons I face are different, they are still real and still present in my life.  Adam's life gives me confidence to know that even though I give in sometimes in weak moments, I do not have to give up.  I can continue to fight because I know that Christ is with me.<br />I was moved to tears as I finished the book.  Reading of all the lives that Adam had touched.  The lives that God had used Adam to influence.  I never met Adam, but through \\"Fearless\\"I feel like I have.  I definitely wish that I would have.  I highly recommend \\"Fearless\\" to anyone who loves this great country, loves the Lord, or just simply loves a story of someone who makes a difference in others lives.<br />Deron

B005LAIHR2|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in years.  It was romantic, funny and the music was great.  Takes me back to my high school years.  Perfectly cast.  Tom Cruise is not my favorite but he killed it here.  Can't wait to watch Julliane Hough and Diego Boneta in the future.  I saw the movie 3 times in the theater and cannot wait for it to be available on DVD.

0805095535|5.0|The first hint we have of what Paul Auster has in store for us is the title itself:  Winter Journal, not Winter Memoir.  Memoirs - the best of them - are not personal narratives, but rather plot lines or themes that bind moments together.  Journals - or diaries - are far more intimate and, one might say, confessional.<br /><br />The second hint is the tense that Paul Auster uses:  second person, not first.  Throughout the journal, he consistently uses \\"you\\";  it is the author having a conversation with his younger self.  The effect is mesmerizing and almost voyeuristic:  it's almost as if we, the readers, stumbled into Mr. Auster's home and overheard some of his deepest fears and secrets.<br /><br />\\"We are all aliens to ourselves,\\" Mr. Auster writes, \\"And if we have any sense of who we are, it is only because we live inside the eyes of others.\\"  Many moments of his existence come vividly to life.  There are poignant moments:  the death of Paul Auster's mother, a time that begins with a numbing and ends in a visceral howl, as \\"the more you feel your body changing, the less you feel that you are made of flesh and blood.\\"  There are beautiful moments, too:  many pages are a love elegy to his wife of 30 years, Siri Hustvedt, an excellent and acclaimed writer in her own right.  And there are funny moments:  a huge fight with an obstreperous Parisian neighbor, ending only when Paul Auster pulls out a certain psychological trump card.<br /><br />This is an elegant retelling, a story of a life that has withstood 64 winters, at a time when a person begins to ask, \\"How much more is left?\\"  It is an inventory of scars - both physical and mental - and an inventory of houses lived in and people encountered.  For the lover of Paul Auster's work - and I certainly am that - there are tantalizing hints throughout about themes and places that show up in his many fictional works:  The Brooklyn Follies, Invisible Sunset Park, for example.<br /><br />Just as Paul Auster focuses on themes of absurdism and existentialism in his work, he now shows how it applies to life...along with the real, the mundane, the poignant.  I have always admired Paul Auster as a writer.  Through Winter Journal, I now feel as if I know him a little better - as a flawed, imperfect, but quite likeable and introspective man.es of absurdism and existentialism in his work, he now shows how it applies to life...along with the real, the mundane, the poignant.

B00338QENI|5.0|Henrietta's family loved her so much and I think Rebecca captures that. Though I debated giving this four stars because sometimes she rambles. I was so engrossed in the family's story. I think the lacks family henriettas chil<br />dren should have received health care from John Hopkins. Otherwise she should have simply been praised and recognition should be given to her. I feel in love with her daughter Deborah.  Great read
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I use this on all my Android devices including the Kindle fire. I stopped using the website as this is better
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It has a neat layout and new and different sounds to choose from. Instead of just waterfalss and crickets, it has music and other new sounds to choose from.
B0088TG252|2.0|The cast was way too good for the writing and editing in this movie.  The plot was so thin, I can't believe that stars like DW, RR, VF, et al. would agree to be in this.  Didn't they read the script beforehand?  On the other hand, if you're a guy that enjoys a mindless, shoot 'em up, violent, car chase-filled action flick with very little plot, no character development and poor editing, then you'll enjoy this movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like it but it is over rated I mean come on now I loved it the first few months now I use it like 10 times a month.

B005K17RU0|5.0|it really fulfil my expectations . I can consult at any time. I highly recommend to download it for<br />for your android
B00772M1F6|5.0|I love the sound, and am extremely happy with this new foray into the current music scene. Awesome stuff. The metalic sounding acoustic rocks even harder today than it did sixty years ago. What a way to find a nitch. I will definitely return to any future sales from this stellar trio.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case in itself I'm very pleased with. Very durable and lightweight. The stand however I was not to thrilled with. It collapses frequently and really only works for watching video. If would fine with having a medeocre stand and a good case then I would reccomend this. If you want a better stand this isn't the case for you.
B006H3MIV8|1.0|As a huge Dylan fan, and a fan of many of the artists on this compilation, I was excited to buy this 4 disc set as soon as it was available.  I have been listening to it off and on since and I have come to the conclusion that it's pretty terrible.  Of the 4 discs there is only as many songs that are even worth listening to.  Most of the songs are terrible covers done without any originality or soul.  Sadly, of the 73 songs, only 4-5 are worth listening to and MANY of the others are VERY difficult to sit through without pressing skip.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|well it is awsome but like you baseacly have to pay for your games with points some \peap,le dont like that but i do
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game!!! I love waiting for the food to cook and waiting on customers. the only thing that would make it better would be if the food did not spoil so fast and if you could pause it
B000W93CHC|5.0|Just finished reading World Without End and honestly liked it better than The Pillars of the Earth....but, not being a scholar of the 14th Century, I enjoyed it for the entertainment value only.  I did notice that the language was more 21st Century, as I am sure that even the word \\"pregnant\\" was definitely not used in thirteen hundred something since it was frowned on in the 1940's.....Also, why it took people so long to figure out how often to take a bath is mind boggling...  More than three days without a shampoo is miserable!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have lots of fun playing this game. Mama 5 enjoys playing this game during down time. Recommended to all.
0345803485|5.0|It's a great book, I enjoyed all 3books and I highly recommend it!! Easy to read and you just want to keep reading :-)
B0065GC0BA|4.0|As a reluctant new member of a book club, this was my first book to read...I thoroughly enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to find time to pick it up and read. Great characters, great story and easy read. Not my usual genre however,one I would recommend.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This app is truly amazing, and I find myself constantly playing it! The graphics are beautiful, and the characters are great! (although I wish there were more- only one girl, really?) Many people complain about it being a rip-off of Minecraft, but I honestly can't see how they could think that. It has the same basic controls/system- build with blocks, kill monsters, complete quests. That's where the likeness ends. In Minecraft, there are creepers- here, there are real (and mythical) animals ranging from pigs and birds to dragons and elementals. This game even has HELL in it. It also has places like &quot;Moria&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Sky World&quot;, but unless you actually spend time searching for these do you understand faintly where and what they are- I discovered Moria when I was digging in a cave and if you get on the ice cubes on the sea and keep walking you'll find the bottom part of Forgotten Sky World. There is no map, only a compass, which is disappointing, as the world is endless. A simple map would be helpfull if each world (seed) wasn't different. Just a small label of what the place is called in the corner would be great.<br /><br />Another good thing about this game is that it gets updated weekly. The first week I bought it, there were glitches with placing blocks. Days later it was fixed along with new recipes.<br /><br />One thing that I don't like about it (it may just be me, though)- the monsters are hard to kill. I had to build blocks around a sheep so it would stay put before I could kill it. They always regenerate too fast- if you try to chase them it's impossible to kill them. Pretty much everything has 150+ HP, and sword attacks start at 10 per hit. Per sword. Magic starts at 20, which is better, but to create a staff you have to go adventuring before you can collect the ingrediants. And even after that, you have to wait and hold so a magic bar can fill up before the magic is cast. AND THEN all your Mana is gone so you have to wait 1-3 minutes before you can cast again, and by that time the monsters has regained most of the HP they lost.<br /><br />-this is very long, I'm sorry, but I really want to cover everything about this amazing app-<br />The soundtrack. Oh my God. Where do I begin? The sound track is BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING! It reminds me of Umineko BGM, with the classical piano sounds. The down side? It doesn't play nearly enough! A small 15-50 second clip will play about every 5 minutes, which will make you want to hear more. They play at random- no specific music for unimportant things. I would definitely buy a BGM soundtrack for this app!<br /><br />Back to the graphics. The terrain and ground looks great, but if you want to see a beautiful feat of RPG screens, wait till night and look up. The sky is amazing, just watch out for the red eyes ;)<br /><br />The reason I play this app so much is because of all the things mentioned above, but also because of the fact that it doesn't need Wi-Fi. Most apps now need a Wi-Fi connection, but Block Story doesn't. Good upside!<br /><br />In the end, this app is worth $5. The creators of this app are amazing, and Block Story deserves 5 stars!
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's just like a regular game of solitaire. nothing too fancy and the ads are not distracting. also provides hints which is helpful and for people learning how to play.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'm glad I got this app.  It started simple, a little too simple, but definitely more challenging as you go.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I got bored at work and downloaded this game and found its not half bad though the ads are a bit obnoxious. definitely a fun way to stay busy.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this for a trip where I promised my wife I would leave the laptop (too much temptation to work); It works great!  Beware, you can insert it upside down and nothing happens.  I inserted this upside down and nothing happened so I flipped it and the pics showed almost instantly.  I downloaded around 35 pics in a few minutes (Canon EOS T4i at standard setting) and then edited and uploaded to Facebook.  The product is great, the laptop stays home!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|this is a fun addictive game. good interface and it runs smoothly on my tf101, some in optional app purchases and overall good game

0307891402|5.0|I have to say this item was delivered to me in condition than I had expected. It came to me in its original shrink wrap so I know was getting the brand item that I had ordered. It was also delivered to me before the estimated delivery date which was definitely a plus. I look forward to doing business with this seller again in the near future.
B004P7CNUY|5.0|This movie exceeds all expectations.  Now I love the original Halloween and liked Halloween II.  After those though, I don't believe a good Halloween was made until this movie.  A lot of that has to do with that Jamie Lee Curtis suggested this movie which was released 20 years after her original debut.  This movie had an amazing writer and director who realized that a good horror movie goes light on the gore and heavy on the story.  I would recommend this movie for any time your in a scary movie mood or for an awesome Halloween Night Marathon.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It really helps me know how much battery I can use when doing different tasks. Very helpful. I recommend this app to anyone.

B003K16P3M|3.0|I thought the book was pretty good until the ending.  You go through so much with the characters and then it's like the author just got tired of writing.  There were a lot of questions that were left unanswered, at least in my mind.  Unless there is a sequel???
0439023521|2.0|I decided to do something a little different with my review. I decided that it would be best to break this book down into its components so that my 2-star rating would make sense.<br /><br />Protagonist: Every story needs a good protagonist, someone to root for and hope that they succeed over the antagonist (more on that later). Unfortunately, Katniss is a terrible protagonist. She was one of the most unlikable protagonist I've come across in a long time. She was mean, heartless, and just flat out boring. Yes, she took her sister's spot in the reaping and yes she feed her family. That was fine, but throughout the text, she came across as a (you fill in the blank). With such a horrible lead, it's hard to like a novel.<br /><br />Premise: As far as premises go, this one has a big gapping hole that I feel needs to be addressed. The idea is that sometime ago, there was a huge civil war and the Capital came out on top and for punishment, the Capital forces its 12 surrounding districts to give one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 to fight to the death in a televised \\"game\\" called The Hunger Games. So, some genius thought the best way to force people into submission is to have them serve up two of their children in a televised death game? Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a quick way to reinstate rebellion, the thing the Capital wants to avoid. This empire is obviously ran by a not so smart individual.<br /><br />Plot: We all know this song and dance, so I'll just skip this part.<br /><br />Writing: The writing was average at best. As a reader, I love to highlight scenes that are well written or memorable quotes in the books I read. I didn't highlight a single word in the book. The simplistic writing was pretty bland and since it was written in simple present tense, the work read a little choppy (but I got use to it). No one \\"said\\" anything, everyone \\"says\\" things. That type of writing is used in a screenplay, not a novel. The novel was written in first-person point-of-view. This is very limiting as we don't get to meet any of the other characters except in brief moments when they contact Katniss. Besides that, given that Katniss is a terrible lead character, I could have used a break from her, but sadly, I didn't get it. Also, first person POV takes all the tension out of the story because the storyteller has to be alive to tell you a story. No matter how bad things got, Katniss had to live because she was our storyteller.<br /><br />Action: The action was okay I think. Now that I think about it, I don't really remember much action in the book. I remember the (spoiler) apple land mine scene and (spoiler) some dude getting mawed by some overly sized wild wolves, but that's it. This novel was more focused on \\"something terrible could\\" vs \\"something terrible could happen and does happen\\" The action was typically over as soon as it began. If you're looking for action, this novel is not it.<br /><br />Support Characters: This is where the novel is saved from a one-star rating for me. The support characters really shined in this novel. Haymitch was interesting and I can concluded why he acts the way he does, Rue added a level of emotional depth that Katiness was lacking, and Peeta had personality. He was funny, caring, self-sacraficing, and most of all, he made the novel bearable since Katniss did everything she could to make the reader suffer through her insufferable personality.<br /><br />Story: This is where I let out an exaggerated sigh. In a novel, the \\"story\\" aspect is the emotional connection that we as readers get to experience while reading. Katniss left her emotions at home when she went to the games, so what do we have left? We had Rue who, as mentioned before, added emotional depth to the story and Peeta did as well. But in the end, the story boils down to a love triangle. How cliché and boring is that!!?? On top of that, the love triangle wasn't even a good one as it had no bearing on the plot what so ever and it was awkwardly forced. It seemed like a cheap last minute cash-in as a token part of books marketed towards a female audience (but that's just conjecture on my part). After all, from what I hear, a weird love triangle is what made Twilight so popular. Still, that's just conjecture.<br /><br />Antagonist: This is where the novel really feel short. The antagonist is the Capital. Okay, I can go with that. However, the Capital was never personified. We only saw the games. In the Capital, the residents showered Katniss and Peeta with roses and they loved them. That's not the way you sell the antagonist as the antagonist. Furthermore, the residents in the Capital gave Katniss gifts to help her win the games (I know they were bidding on who would win and they did it for selfish reasons, but still, at the end of the day, they still helped her regardless of their motivations). By taking this direction, Collins made the Capital to be less evil. In retrospect, that would be like watching The Dark Knight Rises and Bane gives Batman some gifts to help him out, even though they are enemies and they are fighting. Something that stupid would make me walk out of a theater.<br /><br />Message: All of that aside, what can we take away from this book that is not terribly obvious? The message that I got was that Katniss is a heartless creature that would do anything to survive. She didn't care who she stepped on, loyalty, honor, integrity, honesty, none of those things matter as long as you survive. That is a horrible message. Let me ask you this, isn't overcoming our base animal instincts one of the defining attributes that makes us human? Don't we all strive to be a part of something bigger than ourselves? Isn't it important to stand by your principles, even if that means standing against the world, for something that you believe? Even if the consequences are dire? Well, according to this book, having principles is irrelevant as long as you survive.<br /><br />In summary, readingthis book was like sitting next to a person you hate on an airplane. You can occasionally look out the window and see the clouds, but at the end of the day, you're stuck listening to a deviant.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, skip this book and read The Night Angle Trilogy.
0802130208|5.0|I'll be concise, this is one of the funniest books you'll ever find. Now if you'll excuse me I must go assault a glove.
B005LAIGPU|3.0|I have recently watched three \\"found footage\\" films, and come to the conclusion that I will probably avoid them in future.  This is a shame, as I am sure the genre is here to stay, like reality TV (which also ought to go away), thanks to its lower production costs.  It's come to seem too gimmicky for my taste.  I haven't seen one yet which, the story being good, wouldn't have been a lot more enjoyable had it been shot as a conventional film.  This film is no exception.  And it's a real shame, because I love the story.  It's particularly timely with the spate of superhero films we've been treated to recently, and it's an interesting twist on the idea of a geeky, introverted, loner kid suddenly gifted with super powers that Stan Lee popularized back in the '60s with Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  This time, the geeky, introverted, loner kid doesn't become the hero, he becomes the villain, and the film very believably depicts why this is.  Andrew Detmer, like Peter Parker, is a shy, unpopular kid in his school, but that's about as far as the similarity goes.  Unlike Peter Parker, Andrew doesn't have a loving, supportive family to hold him up, instill decent values and respect for others into him, and give him a solid moral foundation.  His mother might do this, but the terminal illness she'd battling makes her unable to, and effectively isolates Andrew from the one person who would or could.  Her eventual loss will only reinforce Andrew's sense of the world as a profoundly inhospitable and unfair place.  Andrew's father, an abusive alcoholic, is as far from a loving and supportive parent as he could be, and the torrent of scorn and contempt he pours on the kid only increases Andrew's sense of isolation and alienation.  Combine this with the bullying he undergoes at school, and it's no wonder that, as the film develops, Andrew displays a marked lack of empathy or respect for other people.  When this embittered, isolated boy suddenly finds himself possessing godlike powers, it's no wonder that he feels little restraint in lashing out at what seems to him a cold, uncaring world.  His cousin Matt, and popular fellow student Steve, with happier homes and upbringings, are better grounded morally, and better adjusted socially, and thus better able to resist the corrupting influence of this power.<br /><br />This is a great story idea, and it builds up to an appropriately dramatic climax.  What a pity then that the makers of this film chose to tell it through the limited lens of \\"found footage.\\"  I dislike FF films because, for starters, they simply don't move as smoothly.  Far too many scenes (no doubt for verisimilitude) are of boring people doing boring things, like the vast majority of home movies.  I also miss the musical score of a traditional film, which, when good, can enormously enhance the drama, suspense, scariness, or humor of any given scene.  Another problem is that the nature of medium makes it harder to identify with the characters; ordinary people always act different when talking to a camera, and so the characters come across different.  FF, therefore, tends to make effective character development much harder.  FF limits the perspective to the single, supposedly amateur camera, which often causes problems in exposition.  And finally, the number one problem with these films is that I have yet to see one that didn't reach a point (usually pretty early in the film at that) where I didn't ask \\"why would anyone still be filming at this point?\\"  Either you have to wonder at people who are ALWAYS filming, no matter how boring, trivial, or mundane the activity they are recording (and most people don't know anyone who does this), or when the action really gets going, and lives are in danger, you wonder why the character behind the camera would still be concerned about continuing the filming when his very life is on the line.  Either way, it doesn't seem very credible, and hurts suspension of disbelief.  I can't think of a single found footage film that I REALLY enjoyed. The style always seems not only to limit the way in which the story can be told, it also seems to magnify problems like bad acting and bad direction. It simply doesn't work for me, and the final result never feels believable in the way that it seems like it should be, and the makers obviously intend it to be.  Even in the case of this movie, the end result was a film whose story I liked, but I probably won't ever care to watch again, whereas if it had been shot as a conventional movie, I'd probably eagerly add it to my video library.d footage film that I REALLY enjoyed.

1936608898|5.0|Melissa and Dallas have identified 4 good food standards, and in \\"It Starts with Food\\" they walk you through how each food stacks up.  If a food complies with all 4 standards, it gets a green light from the Hartwigs.  If it only hits 3 of the standards, it's out.  Why settle for foods that are less than optimal if you don't have to?  And that's how they convinced me that, regardless of \\"Mr. Red Wine Producer's\\" propaganda about resveratrol, alcohol is not, not even in the form of \\"heart healthy\\" red wine, part of an optimal lifestyle.  It doesn't meet a single one of the good food standards.  This doesn't mean they think you can't occasionally indulge in a cookie or even a glass of wine, just not on a regular basis.  But when you do indulge, make it worth while...turn down the lights and put on some Barry White, and \\"get downright romantic with your cookie\\"!<br /><br />A favorite part of the book for me is chapter 4 where they spill the dirty little secrets of food scientists.  They tell you exactly how \\"foods\\" are designed to mess with your brain and make it really hard to give up the Franken-foods.  But by the time you finish the book (and a Whole 30 or two), you'll be well on your way.<br /><br />The eating protocol that Dallas and Melissa outline in \\"It Starts With Food\\" is backed by hard science - unlike the pseudoscience in fashion magazine articles or the dated information still making the rounds on the evening news.  Do yourself a favor, and read \\"It Starts With Food\\" now instead of in a few years when conventional wisdom catches up with the Hartwigs. And as they say, \\"It's not that radical.  Unless you consider eating nutrient-dense, unprocessed food radical.\\"
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book, highly recommended by an independent book seller, a few months ago.

I'll buy another. :)

Download the free for Kindle book app also--I found some great items there![[ASIN:B004DLPXAO Kindle for Android]]
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Nice funny movie, very nicely done and with good humour.<br />For mature audience as the general idea of the movie seems a little bit too pro drugs.
B00846REIS|3.0|I've already read the fifty shades a grey trilogy and this book makes me think the author had also and then rewrote it in her own words changing the characters a bit.  I didn't think it was a bad book at all, but I probably would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't felt like I had already read it.
B007Q476KU|1.0|This is the most contrived movie I have ever seen.  I imagine that the title of each scene says something like, \\"And this is the scene where we make the audience cry,\\" or \\"In this scene, we create sympathy for the poor horses.\\"  I was eager to see this movie and had a hard time finishing it.  It made me flat out angry.  I know people who loved it... people are different!

Upon attempting to download 10 files from Amazon Cloud, I was presented with a message \\"Linux only allows one file to be downloaded at a time.

I know I can stream Amazon Cloud music files, but streaming is not available when traveling the subways.

B0089LT8Y6|2.0|I give this 1 star for the packaging of the album and 1 star for Andy Sneap's production!  While I admit the musicianship is top notch, it feels uninspired and the lyrics are almost juvenile.<br /><br />Thank God Overkill is still making great albums!
B000057UWZ|4.0|Soundgarden's \\"Badmotorfinger\\" is a great album and an essential one in their discography (together with Ultramega OK and Louder Than Love). So this review is less about the music and more about the mastering problems with this vinyl reissue. It sounds as if it was pressed on poor quality vinyl or mastered from the same audio from the CD edition. On both sides the record starts out sounding well but as the needle moves towards the inner grooves the music gets more and more distorted and loses fidelity. This album deserves much better treatment and should be re-mastered, re-cut and re-pressed.
B007URCTOG|1.0|Horrible movie, I couldn't even finish it.  It was slow, boring, and predictable.  If you have seen the trailer you have seen the movie.

1451627297|5.0|Jake is a divorced high-school and adult-education English teacher.  His life is unremarkable, even boring.<br /><br />Al, the owner of a local diner, shatters that boring life with a secret.<br /><br />Below the storeroom of the diner is a portal.  It opens, unfailingly, on the outskirts of a small town on a sunny afternoon in September of 1958.  For years Al has been venturing through this portal in order to buy hamburg at 1950's prices.  Every time he steps into the past it's a clean slate, and regardless of how long he stays, he reemerges into the present just two minutes later than he left.<br /><br />Over time Al had experimented, making small changes and seeing how the present day handled them.  Then Al has his major brainstorm.  What if someone used the portal to stop the assassination of President Kennedy?  Stopping this murder could prevent the cascade of tragedy that followed in this country, and make for a better future for everyone.<br /><br />By the time Al has gathered enough information about Lee Harvey Oswald to conceivably prevent Kennedy's murder, he is on death's doorstep himself and is unable to go through the door again and wait five years for the right moment to strike.  He needs someone to take up the mantle, and he decides that Jake is just the guy to do it.<br /><br />Jake is reluctant and disbelieving at first, but then he starts to see potential in this plan.  He also sees a way to help someone he knows personally who had a tragic past.<br /><br />Armed with a fake ID, some old money, a lot of sports results, and a huge stack of research on Oswald's day-to-day movements, Jake steps into the past.<br /><br />There is a great deal of waiting around from 1958 to 1963.  Jake fills that time by getting a job, moving into a town, and making some personal connections.  The problem is that personal connections complicate things, and Jake can't afford to lose focus as he tries to save the future.<br /><br />I loved the whole concept of this book.Jake is a great character--a good guy given the opportunity of a lifetime and determined to see it through despite the repercussions.  The cameo of a couple of past King characters was so well done; I love the intertwining stories and the reason behind Jake's student Harry's tragedy.<br /><br />The ending of the story was perfect.  I was worried about what direction the novel would take at the end, but I thought it was really well done and made sense with the rest of the story.<br /><br />As someone who wasn't alive at the time in which this story takes place, I found the history of Oswald to be fascinating, and I enjoyed the history lesson as much as Jake's personal journey.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Colleen Hoover did a great job with the intensity of their relationship. My heart was pounding away in my chest through the entire book. I cried and cried for this couple and their situation(s). This book turned me into a complete sap! I can't even describe just how beautiful their love was. It was passionate and tragic and beautiful... I really don't know what else to say about it other than WOW, JUST WOW.<br /><br />The secondary characters were just as amazing. Lake's mom & brother. Will's brother. Eddie and Gavin. They all had such amazing personality and I loved each and every one of them.
0307744434|5.0|An aging magician is given custody of the small daughter he didn't know he had.  He is satisfied to discover that she has some raw talent, and he is eager to put it to use.<br /><br />The man contacts a friend and rival magician to throw down a challenge--his protege against the other man's, in a contest somewhere in the indeterminate future.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, a small boy is adopted from an orphanage by a strange old man.<br /><br />Years later, a circus springs up in a field in the outskirts of a small town.  The circus, entirely in shades of black and white, is open only at night and contains some of the most amazing and inexplicable things the general public has ever seen.  The circus disappears and reappears somewhere else, with more wonders than before.  It is constantly expanding, growing, becoming even more magical.<br /><br />The young magicians are aware that they are in the middle of a battle, yet they can't bring themselves to be as cutthroat as their fathers.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.  The old magicians were suitably evil and cavalier enough about their children's lives to make good villains.  The descriptions of the circus were breathtaking and beautiful; I loved the detail paid to each tent and the amazing sights they contained.<br /><br />Having the reveurs be characters and seeing things from their point of view was great; it made perfect sense that there would be a group of enthusiasts who would bond together over the magic of the circus, and I liked seeing it from both an outsider's and an insider's view.<br /><br />Everything about this story was charming.

Once all the characters were \\"in place\\" the pace picked up and despite not having lived during WWII, there are so many elements in this book with which any reader can identify...lost love, parental disappointment, struggles with faith, eccentric relatives, etc.  On one hand, I wish there had been a sequel but on the other, it is more than complete as written.  Make sure you include this in one of your \\"must read\\" books.

B001DHXT6G|3.0|I think some of the reviewers here are reviewing the wrong product. This is a review of the pictured box set of DVD's, standard definition, no new CGI effects.<br /><br />Obviously, TOS is the best TV show ever made, so my review doesn't concern the show itself, rather the box set release.<br /><br />Many other people have mentioned the poor quality of the rather gimmiky packaging. It is flimsy and mine is already showing signs of damage even though I have been careful with it.<br />I also received one disk that was defective, a large portion of 'The Galileo Seven' was unreadable in both DVD players in my home.<br /><br />The good new is this:<br />While performing a legitimate 'format shift' from the obsolete DVD format to .avi files to watch on my computer, I discovered two things.<br /><br />Firstly, I set my ripping software to keep retrying when encountering an error, and managed to successfully rip and finally watch 'The Galileo Seven'.<br /><br />Secondly, the entire three seasons, when converted to .avi take up about 28gb, which means that I was able to fit it all onto my tiny 32gb flash drive.<br /><br />Now I have every episode of TOS ever made on my keychain, which is about as awesome as it gets!<br /><br />An added bonus is that I no longer have to sit through the painfully slow menus and non-skippable parts on the DVD's.<br /><br />This is entirely legal as long as you only make a copy for yourself for the purpose of format shifting, much like ripping a cd to listen to it on your ipod.

B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|Why no compromise?<br /><br />Take \\"In the End\\" off of Hybrid Theory, and replace the heavy guitar with synths. Old LP fans will all mostly think the same thing \\"It loses most of its power.\\" It's still a good song, but it wouldn't have been nearly as successful of a single as it was, imo. The new LP fans would most likely still really enjoy it though, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Now take \\"Lost in the Echo\\" off of the new cd, and replace the synths with heavier guitars (You should be able to clearly picture it in your head since it's so close). Is it better or worse? In my opinion it would be better. Much better. LP would still have all their electronic aspects that they've progressed to this point, which most new LP fans love, and old LP fans would be happy to hear the aggressiveness that they so miss.<br /><br />So why doesn't LP do this? Beats me. I think it would be something simple that would finally appease old fans such as myself, yet not throw away where they've progressed to at this point.<br /><br />Progression/Evolution<br /><br />I personally think that when a band progresses that they shouldn't completely get rid of the sound that garnered them their huge fanbase in the beginning, because this will obviously lead to the original fans feeling like they've been abandoned for a shinier sound. After Meteora, I pretty much stopped listening to LP. Not because I thought they were crappy or anything, they're still amazing creative artists, they just went for a sound that I disagreed with. So then why did I listen to this album? A buddy of mine convinced me to listen to this album because according to him \\"LP has gone back to their roots.\\" And they have to an extent, but more on that later.<br /><br />I've read countless reviews about how LP isn't Nu-Metal anymore and they never will be because Nu-Metal died and they progressed as a band. Then most people insult old LP fans by saying that they should evolve along with LP.<br /><br />This is what irritates most people.<br /><br />I don't think that most people think about what they're saying when they say that old LP fans need to evolve. Why on Earth would someone progress along with LP if they didn't agree with the direction that they were going with their sound? If in my eyes they are REGRESSING as a band, why would I choose to follow that? Just because I don't enjoy their new sound doesn't mean that I'm \\"close minded\\" or \\"unevolved\\", it means that my musical taste differs with what they've chosen to do. If anything, stating that old LP fans need to evolve shows close-mindedness because that's taking the high and mighty route of ASSUMING that the route that you've chosen IS the evolved route and the route that they should take also.  I'm mostly a metal head (Black Dahlia Murder, Darkest Hour, Mors Principium Est and a variety of other bands most of you probably don't care about). Yeah I know, that kind of discredits me in most people's eyes, but I also LOVE other types of music. I'm a sucker for neoclassical music, harmonies, piano (George Winston is excellently relaxing), and lately Skrillex and Pendulum.<br /><br />It's hard for me to enjoy where LP is progressing as a band when they take away the one element that I enjoyed the most from their first two albums. The perfect synthesis of aggressive, heavy guitar riffs and atmospheric electronic sounds.<br /><br />Nu-Metal??<br />I personally have never thought of LP as Nu-Metal. When I think of Nu-Metal bands from back in the day, I think of Limp Bizkit and that god awful Metallica album (That which must not be named). Bands and albums like those ended up putting a terrible taste in most people's mouths whenever they'd say \\"Nu-metal.\\" This was the eventual fall of the genre. LP had something most \\"nu-metal\\" bands didn't have back then though. Atmosphere and depth. I disagree with the though that adding heavy guitars to their new stuff would automatically be them going back to Nu-Metal, because I think that just because something has heavy guitar riffs in it doesn't automatically dub it nu-metal.<br /><br />What I would love to hear:<br />Everything that they've done up to this point (surprise!) but add in some sweet HEAVY guitar riffs. In my opinion all it can do is add to the sound that they've created, not detract from it. I'm not asking for another Hybrid Theory here. While that album was awesome, going back to it would get rid of the positive aspects of LPs progression from that album.<br /><br />After listening through the album a few times (yes, every song multiple times), I can honestly say that yes, they kind of did go back to their roots, but not nearly to the extent which old LP fans such as myself were hoping for. Which is why I'm giving this album a 3/5. It's creative, it progresses their electro sound, but it's just not as enjoyable to me as their first two albums. Yes, it's because of the guitars! *hangs head*

(although if you want the nitty gritty science terms...just go to one of their seminars or book signings and speak with them because they've got them!)<br /><br />Throughout the 30 days you basically AVOID:<br />Legumes/Beans/peanuts<br />White Potatoes/all grains<br />Dairy (except for clarified butter/ghee)<br />Sugars/honey/syrups/juices<br />Seed Oils<br />Carageenan/sulfites/MSGs<br /><br />Throughout the 30 days you also WELCOME:<br />Pastured eggs/meats<br />vegetables (organic if possible)<br />fruits (organic if possible)<br />healthy fats (coconut milk or oil/olive oil, avacados,cashews, macadamias, etc)<br /><br />Dallas and Melissa break down these foods to avoid and welcome by discussing how they make you less healthy or more healthy! And at times you wonder, what in the heck can I eat? You actually get quite innovative and discover there are SO many things you can eat beyond our clasically conditioned \\"salad\\" mentality (in fact, I probably only ate a salad like 3 or 4 times the whole month!)<br /><br />I believe in ANY book that offers suggestions for healthy products, but doesn't sell you on a specific product that you HAVE to incorporate into their diet plan. EX: slimfast, weight watcher's, cleansing drinks, etc.  The Hartwig's let you choose all of the healthy foods you want to eat and within their portions for the next 30 days, it's fabulous!<br /><br />Most importantly...they offer tools that let you control those \\"I gotta have me some chocolate NOW\\" kind of cravings! They teach you that you and food have a relationship!  And like any relationship with a friend, it needs healthy nourishment, sacrifice, discipline just as much as you need agency, FULLfillment and enjoyment! ISWF will give you the change you want to see physically, the change you want to have emotionally, and the change you need mentally!  Food is good, and EATING is BELIEVING!!!

0345803485|5.0|My wife kept hearing all the talk on talk television about this book abd wanted me to order and read it and see I thought she would like it. I did and put in my next to read stack. I was very surprised when I started reading, It's very well written, with good charactors and a good plot. I'm not sure I would recommend it for young teenage girls and boys, (Think my grandkids) the sea scenes are very  well written, but very discriptive. This is not at all sex trash books that become gross to read and nor somethink you want your friends to know you read.  Ii ended in such a way that I was hooked and had to know how the story coninued, so have already orded the second story in the series. If you a mature reader and want a good read aout a life style that is outthere you did know about get this book It is a very well written and enjoyabe book. By the way my wife says it on her next to read stack.

0385535139|5.0|I DO NOT WRITE WHAT i CALL  Thesis's on books, I tell my thougts and whether or not I enjoyed the bookl;  This is Gresham's lasted novel, and is much better that the last  several, I think he was trying  to get the \\"ole\\" creative juices  flowing again, i  believe he came a long way but still is not as good and his first few books, in finely detailing the storyline and the narrative going with out causing the reader to have problems keeping up. I have every book he has written except the last Thodore Boone;,I'll probablely get it but it will be awhile.  If you like 'Greshams books you will lile this one, unless you get somesort of thrill of writing a page trashing a book and telling the author how to write one to suit you.  Most people read to relax and dream on adventure.  I again recommend this book for  afairly quite read, it keeps you wondering what and how the lawyers are going to get outfoxed by the big bad Pharmacy Company.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Hearing all the publicity of this book I was expecting a re-mix of Twiglight. Although I give props to the author and for making it a original story I wasn't pleased with the book. Ana a innocent young woman with no expierence with sex is found to be a attracted to a man who is rich, handsome, and nicely endowed.<br />This book took way to long to read for the pathetic story that it told. It is debasing to women, Christen wants a submissive woman who never says no. The woman he wants sounds like something from a book from the 1800's. I don't recommend this book to anyone who is a feminist or believes that woman do have rights. Any woman who believes that we are equal to men will be disgusted by this book; I was. It was a miracle I finished reading this book without thouroughly throwing up.<br />On a side note: this book includes many steamy sex scenes (so many it gets old) and should only be read by a mature audience- bondage is most of the sex scenes.<br />Overall this book is a great book if you are sex deprived and really want to get those hormones pumping, not a book if you are looking for a romantic romantic story.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This CD was great. Arrived early. I would do business with this merchant again.  Very pleased with my purchase of the newest Train CD.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I'm mourning having finished this novel: it's lush and vivid and the characters are both flawed and lovable.  The only character who I felt was a little too perfect was Grant, but all the women in the story are complex and compelling. I found it to be a perfect summer read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The program is easy to use and does what I need it for.  Thank you!  I enjoy the weather display feature on the information bar.  In seconds I know what to expect outside.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I read all the books in this series up to this point, but I will not read farther.  It has just become too boring. I actually just quit this book after reading 80% of it.  It seems that the object of the author at this point is to prolong the series, not develop (or finish) the story.  I feel tht I'm being manipulated for profit; so I won't participate.
0385523904|5.0|\\"Nothing to Envy\\" was impeccably researched and written by an American journalist working in South Korea. Through hours of interviews with defectors from North Korea, combined with several government-sanctioned forays into DPRK, she provides a glimpse into the lives of North Koreans living at nearly every level of society. I have an extremely difficult time imagining there is a better refence on North Korea, nor a more readable one. Anyone looking for a way to begin demystifying the tangled web orfNorth Korean life, BUY THIS BOOK NOW.
