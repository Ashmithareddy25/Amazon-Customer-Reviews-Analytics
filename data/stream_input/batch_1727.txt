0385536828|5.0|\\"Sweet Tooth,\\" begins with an intriguing confession from the narrator: \\"My name is Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) and almost 40 years ago I was sent on a secret mission for the British security service. I didn't return safely. Within 18 months of joining I was sacked, having disgraced myself and ruined my lover, though he certainly had a hand in his own undoing.\\"<br /><br />And while that opening makes clear that it's going to be a spy novel (and nobody can do those better than the British), it's also in some sense a satirical novel of manners (ditto). Maybe you'll think (Thackary + Austen) / Le Carr&eacute;. Mr. McEwan uses first-person narrative by Serena throughout. The story is set in the early 1970s, the time of gasoline shortages, three-day weeks, electrical shortages, and miner's strikes. Serena's a piece of work: a snobbish beautiful blonde with a degree in maths from Cambridge, she's in her early 20s, and she meets no man she doesn't take her knickers down for (or at least wants to). She is introduced to an older intellectual who helps her get a job with MI5. She at first breezes through her entry-level tasks for the British domestic intelligence service before finally getting her first \\"real\\" assignment--attempting to co-opt a young writer, Tom Healy, into the cause (segments of \\"his\\" already published short stories appear in Serena's narrative), and soon, down go those knickers again. And when they do she's faced with the dilemma (eventually resolved beautifully) of whether to tell Tom the truth.<br /><br />For most of the book you may be struck by Serena's lack of self-awareness--the tale is narrated by Serena as she is now but contains no indication she's learned much from her experiences of 40 years before. She's still self-absorbed, and hardly self-aware. Or so it seems. But then . . .<br /><br />So all in all, you'll probably enjoy what turns out to be a superior espionage tale and a unexpectedly cunning social satire.<br /><br />Notes and asides: The \\"Monty Hall\\" paradox, which plays a key role in the tale, was (according to Wikipedia) actually first posed in 1975, so Serena couldn't have known of it a year or two earlier . . . the author notes at one point that Serena and Tom are sitting on the beach at Brighton on a foggy evening that rendered the waning half moon invisible. It would have been invisible even if it had been clear, as waning half moons rise at midnight.onty Hall\\" paradox, which plays a key role in the tale, was (according to Wikipedia) actually first posed in 1975, so Serena couldn't have known of it a year or two earlier . . . the author notes at one point that Serena and Tom are sitting on the beach at Brighton on a foggy evening that rendered the waning half moon invisible.

B003MXEGCK|4.0|It's full of action, intertwined with suspense and drama. The emotions are engaged at many levels. Will Smith has another great performance!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an interesting story. Very well written. Quite an adventure. Too bad his family had to suffer so much. I have seen this &#34;band of brothers relationship&#34; so many times.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I just got my copy from Amazon today and I'm a huge fan of Lana Del Rey. I listen to any and all songs I can from her, whether it's \\"Born to Die\\" or many of her unreleased tracks. Either way, this EP is amazing. It's beautiful. Lana Del Rey's vocals are so chillingly clear throughout this EP, that I'm sure this album is gonna be very popular.<br /><br />If you're a new fan of Lana Del Rey, then by all means buy this album. You will NOT regret it. But if you're unsure it'd be best to go to Youtube or something and get a feel for what she sings like. I'm so glad I bought this CD (I never buy CDs) it's gonna be a new favorite. I LOVE YOU LANA!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am male and it is too much for me. I only got half way through it and turned it over to my wife and daughter. (48). Daughter refused to read it at all and wife got to page 109 then put it down and said she will have to think about going any further. I am glad this was written but I wonder if it really needed to be. I do not think the world is a better place for it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You will either love or hate this show, but you will sit on the edge of your seat wondering, what would I do?
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|I'm very dissapointed and upset with this record. To me it's more Rihanna-like. It's nice to dance to, it's good to shout with but there's almost nothing to listen to.<br />My favourites are: Just a Fool (I guess I will keep it in my playlists on iPod for a long time), Around the World (so nice chorus), Circles (unexpected refrain), Red hot kinda love (very funny).<br /><br />I loved a lot \\"the Lotus intro\\", but for me it would be more nice if it was only intro, not the full-length song with nothing changing after the 1st minute.<br />I really loved the beginning of \\"Cease Fire\\" and would love it even more if it was cut into Intro version opening the second part of the album.<br /><br />I can't listen to Blank Page, Sing for me to the end and I can't do nothing with it. I don't like them at all.<br />Empty Words, Let there be love, Your Body, Army of me mean nothing to me.<br /><br />For me it's the most strange, surprising work of Christina and unfortunately is has the fewest number of tracks to continue listening to: only 6 out of 17.<br /><br />You would advise you to buy it just to get acquanted with something new that Christina can give and do.<br />And no matetr how am I dissappointed I can't wait to see her new shows and live performances.

B0000AK7AA|4.0|great addition to my library for the Halloween holiday. it's a classic that everyone should have. glad I got it and it was on time.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Thank you Susan Boyle<br />I am listening to \\"Standing Ovation\\" as I write this post.  Marvelous!  Susan made an incredible masterpiece with this musical CD. Brilliant! I will urge everyone to go out and get it because it is unbelievable what Susan does with these songs. Beyond words! She was made to sing them. Every single song on this CD is sung from her heart.  I feel tingles through me just listening to each and every song.  Wonderful! What an incredible piece of musical work.  Yes, you will love every song on this stunning CD.  Fabulous!  Her amazing voice should be heard by all. Her songs have taken me to a beautiful, musical place. She said she wanted to be a professional singer and sing to make people happy and she certainly has done that and much more.  She is an amazing person, as well as a magnificent singer. Thank you Susan for this most thoughtful and delightful CD.
B009VB97EY|4.0|oh boy is it fun!!  Watched it with my daughter (who had seen it in the theater) and we had a great time admiring Channing Tatum's dance moves AND BODY.  Some very hot action and choreography.  Matthew McConaughey was absolutely hilarious.  I wasn't a big fan of his before, but this role changed my opinion.  If you're a female, or a gay male, you should enjoy this movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read all of the Percy Jackson books before, So when the heroes of Olympus series came out i was so excited to get reading! I have read all of those books too and this is the most recent one. I LOVE IT.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|While it is not unique it is solid well done SciFi which seems to be an endangered genre these days. It did not lean on the Alien series too much as to destroy it's own value but it did provide a tie-in.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was the first movie we took our 4 year old to see in the theater and he loved it.  We are very picky about the type of language our kids are exposed to and this was okay for us.  The movie has such a good message and prompted a lot of conversation about the environment.
B008ARU5UK|4.0|Great CD. Brings back lots of memories. Love the accoustic versions. Even though it is a recorded live album, would like a little less audience sing-a-long. Would rather listen to him than the audience.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|.........if you are wondering if you should read this book.  What happens in the beginning I was not expecting.  I really enjoyed this book and the sequel (even more).  I appreciated the relationships and enjoyed the poetry in both books.  Some poetry was so emotional that it was hard to read through the tears streaming down my face.  They both make you laugh and cry (and cry).  If you are looking for a happy ending book, try this, but be ready for a rocky road to get there.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|An interesting read though a bit technical and clinical for my taste in this type of reading.<br />I guess I am used to the pleasant scenes and encounters with departed loved ones, and of course, the Lord.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very entertaining!<br /><br />very entertaining<br /><br />i have trouble putting the game down. so much to do<br />i reccomend this game for any age group
B0090EKRKU|5.0|My daughter is 4 (and 3/4 as she often reminds me) and she watched this movie several times during the rental period. I enjoyed the message of the movie that we need to take care of the earth for future generations. I will probably end up buying the movie.
B000W178XO|1.0|I was disappointed in the music.  I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good.  I only recognized 5 of the songs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is very fun and some of the apps are very very very very very very very very addicting. the games should cost less points though.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I found it hard to pay attention to this movie. Although there were some entertaining parts, I thought the movie dragged.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Make no mistake blood, and guts, with plenty of action and some G-shots, but this is not your'e typical t&A movie booooring ! Don't get me wrong love the ladies, this is a very well made movie you feel the action and sense of being involved highly recommended !!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Very high in adventure and a good ending, very happy. I believe that this is one of Angelina Jolie better action movies. Another great mystery movie of hers is The Tourist.
034580404X|5.0|I've never been this engaged to a book! This trilogy rules! The shipment came fast to Peru and in great conditions.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I have been waiting so anxiously for this CD since Honking on Bobo, which while not original music (but honestly who of you heard these songs before this album?), was IMO their best recording since 1984.  I was hoping to hear more of that band, that took me back to the 70s (in all shapes and forms).  I'm glad we finally got a new album but hope they can do better.  And I really hope they do another but there are a lot of songs that seem to be saying goodbye.  They still kick a## live.  Maybe that's what they really have always been, one of the best live bands ever, because I always come back from a show loving a different song that I really hadn't paid attention to previously.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I've seen this movie before and have not seen this BR but I am sure I'll love it even more.
1936608618|5.0|This is a must own book for all endurance athletes.  MacKenzie challenges the conventional wisdom of periodized training in favor of good mechanics and a proper strength and conditioning program so that you can do your sport your whole life without suffering from the nagging injuries most endurance almost continuously face.  The book is straightforward and well organized and is readable cover-to-cover or can be used as a reference book.  Really, who wouldn't want an endurance program that doesn't involve exercising for 3-4 hours every week day and 8 hours every weekend?  To me, that's a no brainer.  Get this book.
B0093LFGMO|4.0|He may have let others hold the crown for a while, but it's still his. As far as male pop stars go, it doesn't get much bigger or talented than Robbie Williams. He knows how to create a good pop album, and that's just what he's done again.<br /><br />It is different to his last offering, 2009's Reality Killed The Video Star, which itself was also a great album. This time, Robbie focuses a lot on more uptempo material. There are hardly any real, slow ballads on this (only about 2), yet at the same time, most of the songs have a lot of heart. A lot of this album sounds like it has influences of U2 with a pinch of Coldplay and even a tiny bit of Keane. I begins with \\"Be A Boy\\", which is a great opener. This could have been the first single in my opinion (it's certainly much better than \\"Candy\\"). This is the kind of song that will have stadiums singing along with him. (10/10)<br /><br />Next up is \\"Gospel\\" which is another big song. It starts off modestly but morphs into being very anthemic towards the end. I do feel that the swear words at the end kind of ruin the song a bit as they seems unnecessary, but otherwise this song is pretty good (8.5/10). \\"Candy\\" is up next, which (somehow) was the first single. This isn't a horrible song, but to me, it is very mediocre, and I can't believe it was chosen as the lead single to represent the album. It sticks out like a sore thumb on the album, as it doesn't sounds like any of the other songs. I could do with or without it (5/10).<br /><br />\\"Different\\" is THE track on this album. This will be the second single in December. It's easily the best track on the album and probably Robbie's best single since his Escapology days. This has the potential to be a big hit and the potential to join other classics like \\"Angels\\", \\"Come Undone\\", \\"Feel\\" and \\"Millennium\\". It's a well, written uptempo ballad. Gorgeous (10/10).<br /><br />The next 2 songs are both uptempo dance/rock songs. \\"S*** On The Radio\\" is a feel-good song, in the vein of \\"A Place To Crash\\" from 2005's Intensive Care album, but more care-free with 80's influences (8/10). \\"All That I Want\\" follows, which I love because it has a dance/pop beat but it's still has guitars (8.5/10). Both of these songs are very catchy. Track 7 is \\"Hunting For You\\", which is lovely. A little more downtempo than the previous tracks, but not by much. (8.5/10).<br /><br />\\"Into The Silence\\" is the second best song after \\"Different\\". This one could (and should) be an upcoming single, in my opinion. The lyrics are amazing. \\"when karma reaches you I want to be there just in case it needs help.\\" They sound really angry on paper, but in the context of the song, they are heartbreaking. A lot of U2 influence on this one (10/10).<br /><br />A lot of people will consider \\"Hey Wow Yeah Yeah\\" as the filler track. Certainly, it seems more like b side material, but I actually don't mind it. The lyrics are not very deep, but they're not supposed to be (6.5/10). \\"Not Like the Others\\" is another great uptempo rock track. It's a good, catchy song, but there are so many other greater songs on the album that overshadow it a bit (7.5/10).<br /><br />\\"Losers\\". This is the one track I just really don't care too much for. I know Robbie loves it, and a lot of other fans love it, but to me his vocals are too screechy at times. Not too crazy about the lyrics either. I didn't even know this was a cover song, but I guess it makes sense. (4/10)<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains 2 bonus tracks: \\"Reverse\\", which reminds me of Keane, and \\"Eight Letters\\". \\"Reverse\\" is another big, uptempo ballad in the vein of \\"Different\\" (but not as amazing). Its serves well as a bonus track. (8/10) \\"Eight Letters\\" is a nice song, but this version needs a little more polishing up, especially Robbie's vocals. Sounds a little too rough around the edges (it may be a demo version, but I'm not sure. Plus, it's just a pinch too sappy for me (7.5/10)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this album. I givethe entire album and 8/10, which is well above average. I hope Robbie keeps churning out songs and doesn't wait too long until his next album.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys. Great music. Talented bunch. Can't get enough of their music. Their videos are fantastic.  Like to see more
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I got up early to download the mp3 album from Amazon and can't stop listening.  Quite simply, Susan Boyle's voice is so beautiful, so pure.  She just seems to get better and better.  The selection of songs is superb.  As the title says, this album includes the greatest songs from the stage.  Every track I listen to, I think it's my favorite and then I come to the next one and think the same thing.  Impossible to choose a favorite.<br />Also, how wonderful to have the great Michael Crawford on this album with the sensational duet of \\"Music of the Night\\".  He has a voice like no other; he is acting and singing at the same time.  I also love the duets with Donny Osmond \\"All I Ask Of You\\" and \\"This Is The Moment\\".<br />All in all, I am thrilled with this album and I believe anyone who loves beautiful music will enjoy it immensely.  Also a great gift for Christmas as my friends will discover when they unwrap their presents from me!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Unlike prior works, no inspiring moral here.<br />Basically a time waster.<br />Guess pop authors think they have to come up with something<br />But when that's just an old plot of frees and corruption, with an amoral antihero, plus a predictable conclusion,<br />It would be better for Vrisham to wait  until he, once again,has something worth saying.<br />Don't recommend. Read his other books, instead, if you haven't.
B004SMDJ9U|3.0|This concept is great (albeit not original) and the bigger picture storyline is good. Unfortunately, I got started in the middle of the 3rd season so I knew a lot of what you find out as the 1st season goes along.<br />The part I have mixed feelings is the individual stories of each episode. First, the same exact thing is happening in every case - people's 'troubles' flare up and hurt people. That part gets old fast. 2nd, some of those stories sound very similar to other plots I've seen (X-Files of course come to mind). But there are several plot ideas I did find unique. I applaude the writers for trying to do new things.<br />However you can tell a big difference from the 1st season to the few I've seen in #3. The dialogue can be atrocious. The plot is so unpredictable it becomes predictable (not the overall picture just who is to blame for the troubles in each episode). Emily Rose isn't anything special especially early on (I can give the cast a pass, its not NCIS for crying outloud). Bryant's character Nathan is... not very likeable. Balfour as Duke is pretty good, as well as a lot of the side characters. The season finale was one of the best finales I've seen. There's plenty of reason to keep watching in this 1st season.<br />I give it 3 stars because while its not anywhere near X-Files, its worth watching. Especially when you see all the crap that's been coming out lately. It keeps you watching for the overall big plot. It gets better. Just get pass the 1st few episodes and it gets better.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The third book in this series really did not satisfy the plot.  After intense action throughout, the ending disappointed with the \\"happily ever after\\" treatment.
B0000024JN|5.0|One of my criterion for a five star album is that it bent the popular culture in a direction where everything afterwards changed direction. The debut from The Beastie Boys did just that. The mere fact that they became the first rap act to have a number one album alone makes them historic, but the album itself still stands the test of time from 1986 on. Made by a trio of well heeled inner city brats, \\"Licensed to Ill\\" was noisy, brash, snotty and made like a punk rock album. It rocked harder than many current rock albums of the period.<br /><br />That came courtesy of the sampling. Among the usual array of funk samples were lifts from Led Zepplin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Clash and others. These upped the volume and the more jagged feel of \\"Ill,\\" spiking the sound to match the juvenile force of the lyrics. Those words centered mostly on getting high, loose women, and partying your brains out in the most politically incorrect fashion possible. To that extent, \\"Fight For Your Right To Party\\" may be as radical a single as \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" was for the Sex Pistols.<br /><br />That the Beasties also were traditional song structuralists made them more accessible. \\"Party,\\" Girls\\" and much of the album used traditional song bridge chorus structure that made the songs concise punches of aggression and teenaged snottiness. Nobody was going to tell them what they could or could not do, which meant that their raps were punctuated by the heavy metal of a Kerry King (Slayer) guitar solo for \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn.\\" This was the album that made rap creep into the suburbs. \\"Licensed To Ill\\" was so radical an album that The Beasties never quite could make another one like it, despite their continued success (and their more mature attitudes as their success grew), making it not just a great album, but a call to arms for plenty of musicians to follow.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|have watched this movie twice now thoroughly enjoyed it action packed scenes wicked japanese make excellent scifi movies some of which put hollywood to shame
B0053TWVDC|4.0|CHILDREN OF THE CORN<br /><br />This is one of those movies that seems to divide people, some love it and consider it a classic while others not so much. I know people on both sides of the fence on this subject and have listened to them all on their thoughts. Me myself I fall somewhere in the middle since I do like the movie but admit that it is not as great as some say. In fact if you want a good one check out the first filming of this story on \\"Stephen King's Nightshift Collection\\" movie called \\"Disciples of the Crow\\". It is a better telling of the story and like the story is a short film.<br /><br />Based on King's short story the film follows a couple traveling the country that happen to have an accident near the town of Gatlin Nebraska. This town though is not as it seems when the couple arrive, the town has a secret that may be the end of them both. An entity known only as \\"He who walks behind the rows\\" has taken control of the town's children and has them following his religion. And with that control he has them kill off all adults in brutal fashion.<br /><br />Now it seems that those who believe that this is a classic believe so for one of a couple of reasons I think, could be wrong, have been before. Any way I think a lot of people put this as classic status because it is a King movie, and one from the 80's none the less. Now that can be easily disputed because is that really a reason to label something classic? Then of course there are those who consider it a classic because they watched it when they were young. Now for those who say that I will not debate you at all because I am guilty of that with some titles as well, so I can see that. You are not looking at it as another movie that you would judge more realistically today because it holds a special place in your heart. I am down with that because I do the same thing with movies I watched as a kid.<br /><br />Now on to those who hate this movie all I can say is most I have talked to did not have actualreasons for disliking it other than so many call it a classic because it is a King flick from the 80's. Now I am not talking about everybody because there are people who have actual reasons for disliking it like there are those with actual reasons to like it. Any way as for my opinion I have to say I actually like this movie, not love although there are things I love in it.<br /><br />Now at full length it was always going to hard to make the short story stay interesting. Don't get me wrong I think there maybe someone out there who can make the right film for this, someday maybe. In order for this to work as a full length film it would have to have suspense like crazy and atmosphere throughout the entire film. I feel like if this story could be done like the old school horror films it would be a huge success. But any way I have to say I loved the actual short story and like the movie. It has flaws of course but the idea always was interesting to me. Plus I always loved the \\"He who walks behind the rows\\" line, super cool line in my opinion. Then of course I thought John Franklin was creepy as child preacher Isaac, but it was Courtney Gains who stole the show. I always liked his portrayal of Malachai and the scene where he is yelling \\"Outlander\\" was great.<br /><br />Now of course the film has its flaws such as the pacing, the movie tends to move slowly at times. That seems to be the films biggest problem I think and some of the acting is not up to par. Also time has not helped that ending and its special effects which is not the movies fault I must point out but it is there. I believe director Fritz Kiersch did what he could with the adaptation since at full length it is not horrible.<br /><br />I have to say that no matter how I feel about the flick the DVD is great with behind the scenes stuff and an excellent commentary. This is one of those commentaries in which they actually give some good behind the scenes stuff up and tell some funny stories from the set. Likethe kid in the road thing with the accident at the beginning. Any way I would say if you are interested in King's films then pick up the special addition here for the special features.

B005PK553C|5.0|Suspenseful, dramatic and scary. Well written stories by some good writers. If horror is your thing, you will not be disappointed. I would highly recommend this. Beware though some scenes may not be good for the faint of heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|like other reviews its flawless.  no lag but it needs these things. jungle biome, snow biome, oselot, hunger bar. It works awesome on my kindle fire!!!!!!!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|Silly plot but the action was good.  Nice Friday night movie eating popcorn in front of the TV.  I'll likely never watch it again but worth watching once.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this game is really fun u get to go on an adventure to defeat the chaos and you get to battle with other monsters on the dark side and the monsters are so cute you do have to spend real money if ur impatient but you get alot of money on the game to buy thing for you monsters and you can buy stuff to get more money.anyways u should get it

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|This is not Lee Child's best. A flimsy story that drags on and becomes a little predictable towards the end. To little of Reachers typical aggressiveness.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is one of those that is truly difficult to piece meal.  You get hooked and want to watch back-to-back...
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This film represents the work of two masters; Stephen King and Frank Darabont.  This is a monster movie, no doubt, but the monsters are not all tentacled beasts.  Some are perfectly human.  DO NOT MISS.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|Every now and then you hear a set of melodies that are so beautiful, so well orchestrated and so well delivered that it totally engrosses your attention and you get lost in sound. That's how I describe this CD. It's pure beauty. A must-own for those who enjoy contemporary classical music. The very first track sets the tone for the CD. It is one of the most beautiful musical scores that I've ever heard.
B003VANOFY|4.0|First of all, these headphones are great.  Incredible sound quality and the most comfortable set I've ever worn.  That said, I have a few complaints.  First, the battery life leaves a little to be desired.  The software that comes with contains an application that lets you tweak profiles and adjust the sound, etc, as well as letting you know the remaining battery life/charge time.  Fully charged, it says I should get about 9 hours of use, but I've found this to be pretty overstated, I usually only get around 5.  The power button could also use some tweaking; sometimes I have to press it 5 or 6 times before they actually connect and turn on.  The volume control on the side of the unit is randomly unresponsive, and the unit's wireless connection will occasionally disconnect for no apparent reason.  This can be fairly annoying while watching a movie, because you can have 10 seconds or so w/ no audio before it reconnects.  Even more so with gaming, because it distracts you and makes you think about trying to turn the set back on.  Bottom line is that this is a great sounding and comfortable set, but it has some issues that, with the price tag, I did not expect to be present.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was wonderful..especially for the over 50 viewers. Dame Judi Dench was excellent and Maggie Smith was the<br />best. It was very funny and touching
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fun easy read. It can be totally predictable but sucks you in because in the end all intimacy aside it is a love story. Could have been a much smaller book- too much fluff in some parts of the book, but overall fun, cheesy and a good distraction from my life as a mom.
1449410243|5.0|This book was very funny. It made a great birthday gift for my husband, he loves The Oatmeal. I purchased this one, along with the reasons to punch a dolphin book. Great for a good laugh. I love the pull out posters.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual for John Grishman, this book didn't let me down.  I love his legal thriller books.  Characters kept just ahead of you so you had to keep guessing what was going to happen next.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Perfect movie for date night. Funny and a little romantic. We would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh
B008Y65N72|5.0|We traveled from Ohio to Virginia and back and listened to most of this audio book.  We enjoyed it because the author was on a journey herself.  Hers was much more severe but ours had surprises and adventures as well.  I recommend it to anyone who is progressing from one point to another.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|For some reason the videos won't play. I was really looking forward to watching Rihanna's new video &quot;Diamonds &quot;. Tried to play other videos as well and they will not play either. It just shows a black screen searching. Please fix issue ASAP.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much I play it every day I play it every day after school it is a awoke game
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. However your finger tends to slide off the screen and you end up restarting ...over and over again. Lots of fun!!
B00846REIS|3.0|I was really excited to read this book after reading the 50 Shades of Gray trilogy, but was disappointed with Bared to You. I felt that the language was crude and the story itself was very similar to 50 Shades, but not as well written. The story wasn't as developed and I just didn't enjoy it as much. With the 50 Shades books I couldn't wait to read the next book and was sad when the trilogy ended, but with Bared I haven't even really considered purchasing the second book.
B006KP3XCQ|5.0|Very entertaining, very funny, very cute. Definitely a family film.  The garbage issue was never resolved but it's a good story.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|This game did not work on my android phone.  A shame, I was looking forward to playing it.  I have nothing good or bad to say about it.
B002RO76Y0|5.0|This is a good CD.  I had both the \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" vinyl albums back when they were first issued.  There are some good tracks on these rare records, well worth it for the Doors fan - even without Jim's vocals.  I can hear Jim's vocal inflections over the vocals... you can imagine his own take on things when listening to these often overlooked tracks.<br /><br />Robbie, Ray, and John provide alternative voicing that is heartfelt, but not overly experienced.  Ray does the best job of it... there are some very sincere tracks here.<br /><br />\\"Ships with Sails\\" is perhaps the most notable.  Its almost haunting...  I dunno, but when I'm listening to it, my mind wanders to the other Doors classic \\"Spanish Caravan\\" which is largely out of their psychedelic-rock genre.<br /><br />Some good blues too - as all Doors albums should have.  There's the classic \\"Good Rockin'\\".  To me Robbie seems to be really getting into his performance on this one.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Verdillac\\" a lot (on Full Circle).<br /><br />Hardwood Floor, Peking King, The Mosquito, The Piano Bird... you can hear Jim in these.... sadly it seems.<br /><br />This is a good collection.  When I was playing out, we'd usually do a little Doors tribute, and always include a track or sometimes two from these two albums.  Good Rockin', Verdillac... and the ever popular crowd pleasing tune - \\"Variety is the Spice of Life\\".<br /><br />Worth getting, worth a listen and a come-back listen from time to time.  A must for the Doors fan, even without Jim.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is so much more than a book for teenagers. The book deals with issues of survival, social inequality, totalitarian regimes and a lot of adventure.  Definitely worth it.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|This Norwegian film was probably made at 1/100 or less cost of \\"Skyfall\\" or \\"Dark Knight Rises\\"<br />but with 100 times more entertainment values, with a good story, full of surprises, thrills and humor.<br />Not to be missed.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Not a very engaging book.  A very quick read. Was anxious to finish it so I could simply move on to a new book.  A real let down.

0812984412|1.0|I am ever so glad I did not pay a dime for this monotonous tome. I do feel sorry for the trees that were butchered to make this terrible book. The stories are boring and ponderous. The interconnects consist of a single sentence or two. It is hard to pick a story that was the most pointless but I think it was the guy stuck in the old folks home. How did that relate the collapse of mankind in the far future? The answer, it did not, it was filler like 99% of the book. If anyone reading the book want to save many hours of their life just skip to the last page. You will learn that unchecked greed and lust for power is bad and can lead to bad things. With all the 5-star reviews of this book you would think the author is the first one to espouse this idea and it was a great revelation.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|What a waste of time!  I saw the preview and thought it might be a indie horror flick and it turned out horrible.  Bad acting, script, film work...I wish I did not wait so long to get to the end and did not waste $3.99 on this movie...if it was free it still would be terrible.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever and is a wonderful way to learn to bo more focused and work better with your tilting and finger movements.
B003274QH6|5.0|Straight up one of the best, most creative, fierce, funny and outright insane shows I've ever seen. Literally from the first scene of the series (those who have seen it know what's up) this hits the ground at a frantic pace and never lets up. It is so wrong on so many levels, its a testament to great writing, acting and directing that despite how wrong it is you end up cheering for the main character pretty much from the jump and continue to do so atrocity after atrocity. TRIPPY. Lots of grey areas to explore in this series, and they do it very well. Don't expect anything to be straight forward, everything is subject to twists, and often brilliant ones. I really wish I could go into more detail but this is the kind of show you really don't want even the slightest hint of spoilers for. It deserves a 5 though, big time. BIG time. Cranston has become one of my favorite actors with this. Who knew Malcom's dad had such ferocity in him?
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I was not expecting the subtle themes of fate and loss in a Tinkerbell movie. My 4 year old has watched the entire movie several times, and it has inspired play and art projects. It has also launched meaningful teaching opportunities about difficult topics, like separation from loved ones and permanent disability and the power of love. Give this one a try. You will be pleasantly surprised by its longevity in your family library.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This album took a few spins plus seeing it performed live 15ft in front of me before it really started to click. Its really best experienced start to finish. I love that the Pumpkins are going in a more progressive direction as it suits their sound very well. The vultures were circling this band for a few years, but with this release they have secured my interest for their next few albums.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Constantly crashes or refuses to load causing system crashes on my android tablet. Seems time for update. Shame. Always used this on iPod with no problems.<br /><br />Have to reboot every time I try to use it.<br /><br />:(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I reluctantly purchased this book. I wasn't sure if I could take any more Fifty. I have to say, I am super pleased I decided to buy. Not o ly was the story pretty good, but to have been allowed to  see what makes Christian tick was pretty awesome. I really appreciate the Epilogue. Now having sang the stories praises, let me just add, there were times when the communication script between Christian and Ana became a little annoying and I wish Christian would have been allowed to redeem himself after Ana gave him the NEWS (don't want to spoil it). I realized that to have Christian react any other way would have been so UNFIFTY. I don't know it was almost a hard limit for me ;) At any rate, it is a story worth reading.  OH Yeah..the Erotic scene were SUPER NOVA!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|wow best batman movie ever. I wont lie Bane lacked and was no Heath Ledger but overall this film had tremendous personality. the DVD will be nice but nothing like IMAX.
0385342063|3.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite chick lit authors out there and I enjoy reading her books so much that I instantly pre-ordered I've Got Your Number as soon as I heard about it. My expectations were high, of course. Sadly, I didn't fall in love with it.<br /><br />Yes, I laughed a lot and the plot was funny, simple and incredibly crazy which is Sophie's writing signature. But somehow this time the main character, Poppy, got on my nerves. Like, big, BIG time. Throughout the first half of the book I really wanted to grab her by her shoulders and shake her, or maybe slap her right there, I don't know.<br /><br />The thing is, Poppy was really nice and caring but also immature (and she is 29 years old!), irresponsible and careless most of the time. And I found myself speaking out loud, trying to put some sense into her head more than I care to admit.<br />And I know these kind of books are fun because we like to read about normal girls finding love in the most unexpected way but... Ok, let me give you a short example of Poppy's behavior:<br /><br />\\"All those unanswered emails that have been nagging away at me. All those poor ignored people trying to get in touch with Sam. Why shouldn't I answer them? I'm doing him such a service! I feel like I'm repaying him [...].<br />In fact, what about a round-robin email telling everyone they're fab? Why not? Who can it hurt?\\"<br /><br />Really? You are doing him a favor by sending his whole company an e-mail and pretending you are him?! Really?! What if he gets in trouble?! Right, you didn't think about it, did you?... (I know I'm ranting, sorry).<br /><br />So, during the first half of the book I wanted to slap her a few times. Gladly for me the other half was really better and Poppy kind of redeemed herself. By then she was starting to realize that she may had done a few reckless things and trying to sort them out.<br /><br />The plot itself was really good and different. First we have a Poppy who is freaking out because she's lost her engagement ring in a hotel party, and then her cellphone is gone too, which means there's no way to contact her and give her back her ring is someone finds it. And her wedding is in a few days.<br />But then a small miracle happens and she finds a cellphone in a bin so, hey, who finds it keeps it, right? Turns out the cell belongs to a PA and her boss, Sam, is calling her with an emergency.<br />Which is why Poppy decides to help the guy out. And becomes some sort of PA in exchange of keeping the phone a few more days.<br /><br />Soon we discover that her soon-to-be family-in-law is clever, like, all of them, including his fiance, are academics who like to write papers for every single small thing. And Poppy feels completely inferior and stupid compared to them.<br />Her fiance, Magnus, tries to protect her but at the same time lacks credibility. And although Poppy believes he is almost perfect the truth is different.<br /><br />But my favorite character, by far, was Sam. Maybe he can be a little bit cold sometimes but he is also responsible and loyal. And that's the quality I value the most. And I enjoyed a lot his development throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall I liked it but didn't love it which makes me feel sad. But if what you want is a fun and light read then this is certainly your book.
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend as a sweetest day present. He loved the book and couldn't put it down. I think that I might actually read it because of all of the good things that he's had to say about it.

B009WJ2XT6|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I noticed David Arnold's name had disappeared from the credits to be replaced by Thomas Newman's.<br /><br />My doubt was removed when I paid more attention. His score is a perfect blend of the John Barry style and the more modern styles of David Arnold. I've greatly enjoyed it and am currently on my third playthrough of the soundtrack in just two days.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Read the book before the movie in hopes of making what is billed as a confusing movie better. The book is well written and very interesting, but I was hoping fantastic. Also, it did tax my memory thinking back to each first part characters.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Loved the book, hated the movie.  The book was an intelligent meld of history and horror fiction, the movie was cartoonish at best.  This could have been a hit if they had not rewritten the script and followed the roadmap of the story.
1935251740|1.0|The ideas presented in the book are interesting, but they're not new. The idea that biology and consciousness could be the origin of physical concepts was explored by the theoretical physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner in 1960 in his article titled \\"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\\". It's also been discussed, in various degrees, by John von Neumann, Henry Stapp, Stuartt Hameroff and Roger Penrose (to name a few!). I feel like Lanza is trying to take undue credit for these theories and trying to coin a catchy term like \\"biocentrism\\" that can be associated with his name. The only function of the utterly useless and blatantly repetitive \\"principles\\" of biocentrism seemed to be to make it seem like a more legitimate theory.<br /><br />Although I was very excited to read this book I had, right from the first chapter, the feeling that I couldn't really trust the information provided. A lot of huge facts, and interpretations about the science behind the concepts discussed in the book are breezed over very quickly and often without any mention of the name of the actual phenomenon, experiment or concept being discussed and almost always without any references, which really makes it seem like Lanza is trying to allow more credit to fall on himself. The way the book is written is in some ways an insult to the intelligent reader by asking them to just accept what he claims without describing or at least referencing the science behind the ideas.<br /><br />The autobiographical content is often completely out of place and inappropriate. It really seemed like Lanza is trying to make himself seem impressive, both philosophically and professionally (there's a lot of scientific name dropping and references to his own research completely unrelated to the thesis of the book). I don't necessarily doubt the validity of what he claims in these cases, but it did not add any weight to his \\"newly proposed\\" idea of biocentrism and the space would have been much better used to reference the science discussed as well as credit the people who originally proposed these theories.

0525423656|4.0|It's about time I got around to reading Crossed.  I've been wanting to read this book since I first finished Matched but for some reason I kept putting it off.  While Crossed was not quite as enthralling as Matched, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Crossed starts off shortly after the final events of Matched.  I admit that I read Matched a while ago.  I didn't remember exactly what happened but I remembered enough that I could muddle through things.  There were a few points where I was a little confused but lucky for me, those points were clarified.  As for the rest of the story, while it was a little slow, it did a good job of showing what things were like outside of the Society.  The Rising started to take shape in this book and many new questions were posed about what the Society was really up to.  While there wasn't much action to this book, there was enough new information for me to be intrigued and I never once thought about putting it down.<br /><br />The romance seemed very toned down from the first book.  It seemed like Matched spent a good portion of the book setting up the romance between Cassia and Ky.  That wasn't the case with Crossed.  There were some mixed signals in the beginning when I thought Crossed would be Cassia and Xander's book but that was definitely not the case.  The romance between Cassia and Ky is still strong but it took a backseat to everything else going on with them.  New characters were introduced as well as new dangers.  Crossed also was more about Ky's past than anything.  He's not nearly as big a mystery as he was in Matched.<br /><br />Cassia was a little disappointing to me in Crossed.  She was brave, smart, resourceful, and all I could want in a heroine but she just didn't seem special in any way.  She was exactly like all the other dystopian/fantasy/paranormal heroines out there.  I wanted her to stand out to me and she didn't.  I'm  not saying I didn't like I her (because I did), I just really wanted more from her.  Ky was more interesting to me than Cassia was.  He was a very troubled character, both because of his past and his present.  I felt for him and I really wanted to see him happy because it was clear, no matter what he did, he was a good guy.  And yes there is some Xander in Crossed but not much.  Honestly, I like Ky better just because I know him better than Xander.  I have no issues with either boy.  I think they are both great guys but at this point in time I am 100% Team Ky.<br /><br />Overall, Crossed does a great job setting things up for the final book in the trilogy.  It narrowly avoided the second book syndrome but in the end I was pleased with it.  Things are relatively wrapped up at the end, it's not a cliffhanger, and readers won't mind the wait for the final book too much.her.  Ky was more interesting to me than Cassia was.

B007SGM084|2.0|Had to read it to see what all the hype was about...what a waste of my time and money. I think the sex has to be what is making this book sell because it sure didn't have much of a story line. Even the sex became boring and redundant...skipped most all of those scenes because it was sounding too much like the same ole same old. The characters had the chance to be so much more than what they were, the author blew it. I won't be buying or reading any more of her books.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I really like having the extended versions of the movie. The quality is top-notch and I got it really quickly.
B005PK553C|5.0|Five star.  Brilliant actors.  Watched it twice.  Also enjoyed the ease of renting this item.  Brilliant writers, producers, etc.  Must-see.  Watching Season 2 twice also.
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|Christina Aguilera has always been one that I've liked watching perform and waiting for most of her albums to release. This album I was kinda interested in especially after her single &#34;Your Body&#34; turned out to be solid. On about 6 or so songs there is still that same quality. Tracks like the intro, &#34;Sing For Me&#34;, &#34;Best Of Me&#34;, &#34;Just A Fool&#34; with Blake Shelton, &#34;Empty Words&#34; and maybe &#34;Light Up The Sky&#34; make you want to own them. These are my favorites. Some of the other tracks are OK but nothing essential in my mind. The worst offender here is definitely &#34;Shut Up&#34; which even the title indicates that the song will likely be childish (it is).<br /><br />Overall, I'd aim for the standard version. It's cheaper and you aren't missing out on much if you skip the deluxe.<br /><br />3.5 stars. ✨
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Other than knowing this was a story about a boy and a tiger in a life-boat I knew nothing else whatsoever about Pi or his life. Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\", is a wonderful story, beautifully written and at times beguiling and teasingly thought provoking. This \\"true story\\" with its youthful honesty gathers the reader into it's core and quietly gains our trust right from the outset.<br /><br />The book is written in a thoroughly believable biographical manner from a young boy's perspective and I think it's that aspect which makes it really work. It does not surprise me to subsequently find out that so many who have read it believe it to be a true story; the zoological & scientific data given is convincing and grounded in its delivery even when we are wildly rolling along on the high seas with a ferocious Bengal tiger in a small lifeboat!  Often comic yet at the same time horrific it feels like we are at the center of a Shakespearean black comedy. As with all good stories it keeps the reader engaged from cover to cover. I was captivated and couldn't get enough. Pi's circumstances would niggle away at me and I had to find out what happened next.<br /><br />The allegorical twist at the end was not anything I expected and was wonderfully executed, the way it brings the reader full circle on the religious undercurrent running through the story was like a well executed sleight of hand and true to the rest of the book in that it was still entirely believable. For me this turned what was a great story-telling package into a classic novel. I can envisage generations of school-children having their intellect challenged and their view of the world turned on its head with the ideas presented in this book.<br /><br />This is a \\"must-read\\" book and best fictional book in a long time for me.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love this series DVD one and two. Im sure season three will be just as wonderful. However I dont have access to AMC Cable and have a not so great cable company (monopoly) so I have to wait for the dvd to come out to be able to view this show. However in my humble opinion this dvd set (series3) is  much too expensive for pre order. I find that if the price stays at 41 dollars not many fans will purchase. If retailers want to avoid their customers buying bootleg versions they should at least lower the price of dvds to a fair market valueconsidering it costs mere pennys to mass produce. I hope the price of this dvd will be re adjusted to reflect the true value of this product.Then maybe I will consider buying it.

031618201X|5.0|Soulless Manga #1 by Gail Carriger<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this author as well as this series so I had high expectations for this book which were absolutely met!! The storyline worked well and the artwork was amazing! All my favorite parts were in it and though some scenes had to be cut it didn't hinder the story at all!<br /><br />I give this book 5 out of 5 stars, a must read for any steampunk/manga fan!!

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book I would just caution those that have been through physical abuse or aloholism not to read it. Now that I say that it makes the book sound terrible but really it is a suspensful story, something I could see a movie made from.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie was slow, boring, and I was interested in none of the character's in it. Wish I would have rented almost anything else.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As always Mitch Albom has written another incredible book!  I couldn't put it down!  It just goes to show you that no matter the age difference between people we each have something to teach the other.  A great gift for someone!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was unbelievably touching.  The author does a fantastic job of bringing Adam Brown to life.  By the end of this book, I felt like I knew Adam and I could not hold back the tears as I read of his death and the effect it would have on his family and brothers in arms.  Please read this story.  Everybody needs to understand the real cost of war.  As a nation I hope we will do more to support our veterans, as well as support the families of those who have fallen.

1423140605|1.0|This is a great continuation of the series; however, Chapter 25 contains a virus in the Kindle version that does not allow the reader to go any further.  I had to order the hard cover from Amazon and finish the old fashioned way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 of Walking Dead is a definite improvement over Season 2, with lots more zombie encounters & less \\"talking about our feelings while sitting on the hood of the Impala\\". However, more action does not mean less drama or interesting storyline.  There are plenty of questions & situations to keep you interested. You will not be disappointed!  If you are trying to protect your little ones from watching violence, this show is not for you.  With more zombies comes more special effects department creations.  More rotten flesh, more gore, more violence.  It's a Zombie Apocalypse! Yea!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is by far the best angry birds I have played.  From lightsaber action to jedi mind tricks.  Enjoy the background music of each episode, brings you back to the days when Star Wars fist came out.  I have this on my original Kindle Fire (HD 7-inch) and it works great.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story Season 2 is gripping from the start.  Expect to be waiting impatiently for next week's episode! However, this show is NOT suitable for children. They've amplified all the creepy, gory, sick, violence & sex you loved last season! If you liked Season 1, you will not be disappointed.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This is a nice read, it is a light and entertaining story, yet deep enough to be worth your time.  This book has a great twist and turmoil that makes you want to read until the end.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book was AMAZING. Acurately yet excitingly describing the endevers of John-117. This book isn't just for sci-fi fans like myself, it is an action packed tale of friendship, hardship, leadership, and most importantly spaceships.

1416596585|5.0|I don't even read non fiction very often. This book just captured my imagination. Google is a massive company. This book let me in on a ton of the things that keeps this mega business going. This reads like an epic. You can see that even though Google is a massive entity that they still remember why they got there. The chapter about how Google deals with censorship is worth the price of admission.
B002HREKCI|5.0|Are you one of those people who love mystery in novels? Do you also like a little love story including tragedy? If so, Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is perfect for you. One day Clay Jenson, the narrator of the novel, returns home from school, he finds a mysterious box addressed to him with his name on it just sitting on the front porch. Clay discovers that inside the mysterious box consists of 13 cassette tapes. His reactions at first are filled with confusion and horror as he looks at the package and tries to understand what it is that these cassettes are. He starts to play these cassettes and finds out that they are recordings of a girl named Hannah Baker, a girl in Clay's class who has had a love history with Clay. This girl committed suicide from a young age. On tape, Hannah explains thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life and each cassette is one reason. Clay is one of the reasons and this is why he received this package. The thirteen people who had an influence on her death, receives one of these packages. This novel is targeted mostly towards high school or middle school students. Moreover, I would have to say that this is one of the most intriguing books I have read it a while. I really fell in love with it because it had that suspense to it that you always wanted to know what happened next so it was hard to put it down. Many people can relate to Hannah Baker, because her situations that she went through throughout her life are very realistic and relatable to present teenage students and their situations that they experience. The novels main impact that it will have on readers is that it teaches life lessons that can really dissuade someone from doing something that in the future that they didn't really think about fully and would've done something differently.

1576754227|5.0|\\"After purchasing [[ASIN:B00855CUCS No Holds Barred: Life on Your Terms]] (an inspiring story) I came across Eat that frog and thought that with so many positive reviews, there would have to be some great information inside. I was right! Mr. Tracy lays out the foundations of time management and achievement in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. His style of writing makes it seem like he's having a personal conversation with you. I found that not only does it help to have quality information at your reach, but also someone with charisma and tons of experience to relay that information to you. A must read for all leaders and businessmen/women.\\"

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I enjoyed the AB when it first started off...but HATED getting updates, and would have to go back and re-clear stages that has been cleared already.<br /><br />You do not have this problem with ABS...  Every update is a whole new area to open and beat.  There are about 6-7 updates per year, starting in october.  Some of the levels are very challenging....  When there is an update, you do not have to go back to past areas...  You have the new one listed...<br /><br />Like I said, if you like AB...  you will LOVE Seasons.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|Out of all of the musicals I have ever seen, Sweeney Todd has to be my absolute favorite. After trying for years to track down a copy that wasn't falling apart or within my price range, I couldn't contain my joy when I found this movie being sold brand new for such a low price, I couldn't help but purchase it. My copy arrived and it worked perfectly and the picture and audio is stunning. Truly deserving of its place in history. My friends and I still find time to watch this movie together once a month, but it usually becomes an all-day affair since we have to stop to sing or rewind our favorite parts.
B008458O3S|5.0|Have had fun with other Noodlecake games and this one is really great. The puzzles make you think and plan ahead. It is similar to Free Flow, but the combination of color of the trains makes the game more difficult. If you like thinking games over fast action, get this one.
B000HEWEEE|1.0|I love this movie!  I have rented it numerous times over the years and finally decided to purchase the video.  I made the mistake of thinking that \\"full screen\\" meant it would fill the screen, so after I received it and saw that that was not the case, I returned it.  The seller charged a $3.50 restocking fee for a $7.00 DVD, so I only received half of my purchase price back.  I will say that they processed the refund quickly, but I think a $3.50 restocking fee on an item of this price is outrageous.  Buy the movie--you will love it.  Just don't buy it from this seller.  I later found the widescreen version from another seller at a lower cost than this inferior version sold for.  Trust me, you can do better than buying it here.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|The entire album is so good.  Driving to this music is incredible. I recommend it to all! And I can't wait for the next one.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I have often dogged this current incarnation of the band; mainly for their attempt to copy and rehash the past with a older and different band than the one we all cherish from back in the 70's.  My biggest beef has been with Thayer's early attempts to copy Ace's style and harmonics in his playing.  He is not Ace Frehley, no one except Ace is, so past attempts have always fallen short.  Here Thayer channels Ace's influences and morphs them into his own style.  The result, some of the best guitar solos on any Kiss records since the 70's.  C'mon admit it, who didn't play air guitar to \\"Strutter\\" as a teen.  So my apologies for past criticisms, all is forgiven.  No need for a track to track detailing. If the lead guitar solos and riffs on a Kiss record rock, you know the rest of the album will follow. But I will add the song writing and lyrics on this album are surprisingly \\"good\\" and even somewhat \\"adult\\". A real rock record with a tinge of heavy metal for good measure. I think of a slicker \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" with actual guitar solos.  So if you really miss Ace, and consider the band without him a fraud, you need to give this album a chance. Pleasantly surprised and rockin' out!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a well crafted, very polished game.  It's a perfect way to pass 5 minutes or an hour, and it keeps getting more challenging without becoming too difficult so you don't get bored.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is a good time waster. it does get slow sometimes but not always. there is one part I cant get past yet and it gives it a challenge.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app! I can spend hours playing this game! The best thing is when I'm on a loosing streak there is an option for \\"winning deal\\" so I am guaranteed to win!
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is one of the first \\"Reacher novels\\" and is a must read I wish I had gotten them in when I first became a fan, but no matter as they are all top notch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love all of John Grisham's novels.  They keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  You never know who is guilty until the end.
B004ZZITEU|5.0|I can totally understand why people are giving this album one star. All of those reviews are quite valid, meaning if you don't like it then you don't like it. For me, I love bands taking risks. Sometimes risks work and many times they don't. KISS did Music From \\"The Elder\\" which was completely different from anything before or since. It's my favorite KISS album. What about this one though?<br /><br />Morbid Angel takes a chance by doing some blatant industrial metal songs and other than \\"Radikult\\" which is the weak track on here, I think they are all interesting...even \\"I Am Morbid\\"! Then you have the death metal tracks \\"Existo Vulgoré\\", \\"10 More Dead\\", \\"Nevermore\\", \\"Blades For Baal\\" and \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\", all of which are some of my favorites that they have ever done. Sure the tempos are similar and they don't really slow down much but I use this album to workout to and it's amazing for that.<br /><br />Odds are people will just say I am nuts and maybe I am. I LOVE this album. It took a good 5 listens or more for me to \\"get it\\" but now that I do. I can't stop listening to it.
1936608618|5.0|The title of my review should tell you exactly what this book is about.<br /><br />If you were to google CrossFit or CrossFit Endurance I'm sure you'll find just as many sites that hate this methodology as you will sites that love the approach. The bottom line here is Brian MacKenzie and his team have set out in this book to make you a more efficient, more skillful, and less injury prone runner. If this is something that appeals to you then I'd grab a copy for yourself. The book starts out with an excellent story from TJ Murphy, if you're involved in the endurance community then you probably recognize this name. The book continues with the CrossFit Endurance methodology and theory. The meat of the book covers the skill of running, cycling, and swimming and is finished off with strength and conditioning and mobility. Overall this book is an excellent reference for endurance athletes of all levels as well as strength and conditioning coaches.<br /><br />I'm not going to try and convince you that this method of training is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" as I wouldn't try to convince you to vote for one political party over the other. Some people will just never agree. Fortunately for us we are able to test a new training methodology much more efficiently then we can test presidents. So that is what I'd suggest you do. Grab a copy of this book and really learn what the CrossFit Endurance methodology is all about, give it a shot, and find out for yourself!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Soundgarden finally release their highly anticipated new studio album King Animal and it is a quality collection of songs that brings the band back from their self imposed exile. Following their decision to reunite, Soundgarden gave fans a new song \\"Black Rain\\" from the Badmotorfinger sessions and a killer soundtrack song in \\"Live To Rise\\" but a whole album is what fans really craved. King Animal contains all the trademark heavy riffing and odd timing grooves that Soundgarden is known for along with Chris Cornell's awesome vocal style and wailing screams on top. The entire album is very satisfying but some highlights include the hard rocking opener \\"Been Away Too Long\\", the awesome chorus hook of \\"Non-state Actor\\", the vintage sound and killer Matt Cameron grooves of \\"By Crooked Steps\\", the amazing dark riffs and chanting Cornell vocals of \\"Blood On The Valley Floor\\", the awesome sound of \\"Taree\\" that brings back memories of Down On The Upside, the amazing acoustic verses of \\"Black Saturday\\", and the very heavy guitar riffs of \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\". All members contribute in the songwriting department just as they always used to and the performances are very strong throughout. The deluxe edition contains five demo tracks which is a nice bonus despite not adding anything necessary to the package. The album artwork is memorable and the disc comes housed in a digipack designed sleeve. As a massive fan of Soundgarden I can easily recommend King Animal even though it's not going to replace classic albums such as Badmotorfinger, Superunknown, and Down On The Upside as the very best that Soundgarden offered the world - 4.5 stars.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I haven't finished reading this book, but it is very good and complex. There are many twists and turns and the story is revealed step by step through diary entries by the \\"Gone girl.\\" Interesting also to understand the husband's part.

0385535147|5.0|Malcolm Bannister has lost it all.<br />He was once a small town lawyer, happily married with a young son. Now his is divorced, disbarred and a resident at the Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland for a 10 years sentence, 5 of them still to come.<br /><br />What did he do? Well, he says that he was only guilty of taking on the wrong client and being a bit naive as to what was going on. But when the client came under federal investigation for some very bad deeds, the feds cast a very wide net and poor Malcolm was caught up in it, charge with money laundering, along with the guilty. Five years later, the appeals are over, there is nothing left to do, except the rest of his time.<br /><br />Until a federal judge and his girlfriend are tortured and killed in a secluded lakeside cabin, leaving two bodies and an empty safe and not one other clue. The FBI is investigating but every lead quickly goes cold and they are desperate for a break in the case. And then Malcolm steps forward.<br /><br />He claims to know who killed the judge and what the motive was. And he will be happy to tell the feds in return for them invoking Rule 35, a federal rule that allow a prisoner's sense to be reduced if they provide \\"substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\\" And Malcolm is the man who know the truth and in return he wants his conviction thrown out, he wants out of jail and he wants a new start in the Federal Witness Protection Program.<br />And maybe he wants a tiny bit of revenge against the system as well.<br /><br />That would be all well and interesting, but folks, that is just the first step. Very shortly, after Malcolm's release and the start of his new life, it become apparent that something much bigger and much more complicated is going on, with Malcolm in the lead. And I dare say, until it starts to unroll, you will not have a clue what it is!<br />I saw one description of this book as wicked clever...and that describes it perfectly.<br /><br />I will warn you that at times, things will happen, things will be said, people will do things, that you don't understand. Please, don't worry, it will all become clear soon enough. You just need to see the BIG picture and that will be reveled to the reader, bit by bit, until it all makes sense. Clever, entertaining sense.<br />I will warn you that at times, things will happen, things will be said, people will do things, that you don't understand.

0821221841|5.0|This book is first of trilogy of Ansel Adams - one of the greatest aesthetic photography ideologists of 20 century, and this particular edition is the latest, it was edited considering modern tendencies of digital and optics. This book is ideal for neophytes of photography, it explaining all technical fundamentals of photography, including theory and technical aspects, and preparing reader for following parts (negative and print). Book includes very useful intertext system with \\"links\\", glossary, a lot of pictures and schemes. The text of book is very clear, straight and not too \\"pro\\" and scientific, even few mathematics formulas are very clear (and I'm not a math person at all). This book is essential to any begginer - film or digital, truly bible of photography that raised more than one generation of photographers. Best present for those who are interested in photography and best guide for those who's studying (and probably for those who's teaching as well, to get idea of step-by-step explanation). What is really good about this book that you can always refer to it if you need to clear and refresh any part or formula using glossary or index.

B008JH5CVS|4.0|I don't want to oversell it but this was a fun action movie. It has an Escape from New York feel both in terms of the plot and dialogue. (This time the rescue was in space and it was the President's daughter.) Guy Pearce, who in my opinion is one of the most unappreciated actors of his generation, makes an impression (like he tends to do albeit in brief roles sometimes). He delivers a number of memorable one-liners too. I enjoyed it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Just finished Blake Crouch's Pines and truly enjoyed it.  It kept me engaged throughout - where I couldn't wait to see how everything turned out.  It was an interesting concept, with plenty of twists and turns.<br /><br />Then, to read that he was inspired by Twin Peaks sealed it for me.  I will definitely be checking out more of his work.
B00A135YUW|4.0|Over the past year, LDR's music has grown on me in a way I can't begin to explain.  I don't find a lot of the lyrics to be that relatable to me, but there is just something unique about her voice that catches me.  I couldn't resist picking up \\"Paradise\\" after falling so much in love with \\"Born to Die,\\" and this album did not disappoint me.  The tracks are mostly slow and hypnotic, and a couple of them did blend into other tracks for me (I was admittedly disappointed with her cover of \\"Blue Velvet\\").  Some, however, have stood out as gems in my mind (\\"Bel Air\\" in particular), and I think this album is destined to fall into heavy rotation for me.  LDR's style is certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoyed what you heard on \\"Born to Die,\\" you should at least give this album a try.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked Katniss less in this book than in the previous two. Perhaps I was supposed to. Good story. Grim from start to finish. Her children \\"don't know they play on a graveyard.\\" Grim? Hopeful? More Suzanne Collins please.

B003XRELGQ|5.0|What's not to love about a book with paragraph-long chapters? Makes me feel like a speed reader. And I did speed thru this book. It's so funny, I laughed all the way, especially during the scene in the bar with the bartender and the secretary, and even with its scary premise of an existence of Ice-9. But hey, not a bad way to check out of this world. This is a book I'll read again and again!

1451695195|5.0|This book opens up a lot of very interesting questions.  I am sure that those who are confirmed left-brainers will not see much in it, but for those of us who have an open mind about this subject, the book is very intriguing.  I think it was not a coincidence that this extraordinary experience happened to a man who knows so much about neuroscience, and who can tell what can be and cannot be explained scientifically about this event.  I would not go as far as to call it &#34;Proof,&#34; although I realize that for him it was just that.  The rest of us are not so lucky.  But what I get out of it is that there is much more about consciousness than science can, so far, explain, and that it is not unscientific to suggest that this phenomena needs to be researched far more deeply and seriously.  Thank you for your courage in writing this book, Dr. Alexander.
B00005OWEG|5.0|The Francis Ford Coppola re-edit with 49 minutes of additional footage, &#34;Apocalypse Now Redux&#34; (2001) is a mesmerizing journey through the chaos of the Vietnam War — evoking &#34;The Odyssey&#34; more than &#34;Heart of Darkness.&#34; Coppola's passion and financial gamble is a rarity in today's cinema. &#34;Apocalypse Now Redux&#34; remains a textbook example of accomplished filmmaking with its innovative sound, location cinematography and stream-of-consciousness narrative. Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper deliver classic portrayals. The extra scene with Marlon Brando's tortured Colonel Kurtz emphasizes his shadowy presence. A masterpiece of sight and sound.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|have an audiophile level addiction to sound gadgets.  This gadget is one of my favorites I have ever purchased.  I am not the type to go into gross detail of the warmth and the sound stage and all that mumbo jumbo I just like things that sound good and I base my reviews on kind of a sliding scale from \\"sucks\\" to \\"awesome\\".  This device falls squarely in the \\"awesome\\" category.  It works exactly as advertised and the sound you get from upper level headphones $250-$400 can certainly benefit from it.  I've got higher end sennheisers and grados that sound great with this device.  I also have a pair of bose noise cancel headphones that I love and it sounds equally as nice using the DAC although the noise canceling headphones has it's own amp.

However, I don't think it's the story that you should focus on too much, especially if you're looking for a typical beginning middle and end. It's the eeriness of it that should be experienced. This is a real original classic for those willing to open their mind.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative as well as interesting.  Great information about gluten, and what it does to a person. The side effects are appalling. Everyone needs to read this book, just to learn about gluten sensitivity and what it can do to your body, as well as your life.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|An outstanding read. The characters are clear and interesting. It is hard to put down and so easy to pick up. Now I sit, type this small review, and wait for the third book...
0739375970|2.0|I'm sure I'll get disliked for this, but I can't stand how when he's doing the voices for younger characters, they still sound old and feeble. Daenerys shouldn't sound like an 80 year old woman, nor should she sound like a mixture of Scottish and Irish.
B0076794IO|4.0|a good read. Quite a substantial amount of twists and turns possibly too many, but a good writing style. Read.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I guess this may be a child's book, but I wanted to read it because Dr. Wayne Dyer talked about it. He said when he was in grade school his teacher read from this book at the end of the day if the students were good. He liked listening to the story so he made sure the other kids were good so he wouldn't miss it.<br />It's a story about a little girl who was spoiled by her caretakers, because her mother didn't want to bother with her. Her mother had plenty of money but wasn't interested in being a mother. When her mother died Mary was sent to her uncle in a big 100 room house. Her uncle traveled and he had money too so he let the hired help take care of Mary. Her uncle's wife had a garden and one day while sitting on a tree, the branch broke and she died. Her uncle locked up the garden and buried the key. The garden had a wall around it and a door. Mary found it and would go in the garden and plant flowers. She learned a lot when she met a boy who helped her plant seeds.<br />It actually was a book I didn't want to put down. While in the big house she discovered she had a cousin that was handicapped but she changed his life. This book shows that when you really believe something you can change it.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|Dark humor at times.  Different than most dramas.  Good acting.  Storyline a bit slow and too few episodes for a season.  Makes you have to buy multiple seasons.  A bit high on pricing for Prime Members

B0095R76EW|3.0|This movie started entertaining but then it just fell flat.  I do not like the type of movies that the girl needs time away from her boyfriend, fiance, and sleep with another guy to finally realize that she made a mistake.  This movie is predictable and I should have waited until it was free on cable.  That is why I gave it 3 stars because it started pretty good but finished meh!

B0098VYCCE|3.0|After the dazzling visual effects of the trailers, the cast, and the hook of a twist on a well-known story, this was a disappointment.  The motivations of the characters were never clear, unlike in the original fairy tale; the movie tried to make the characters more complicated, but didn't bother to make the character development more complicated as well.  Glad I saw it at home instead of in a movie theater, though.

B007THA4FI|1.0|This was a very big disappointment.  Try as I might I could not get through it. From the start it is chalked full of details about a slew of people that is both tiresome and boring. I barely made it three quarters of the way through and still nothing, and I mean nothing, interesting has happened. One of the girls I work with actually returned her copy on lunch hour as she was so disappointed in it also. As the title says, do not waste your money.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|This classic movie came to life again for me. I have watched it many times, but it is as good as ever. The purchase through Amazon.com was, as always, faultless. Delivery before the expected day, pristine condition.<br />Highly recommended.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who listened to me lament on my issues with eating bread. Makes sense. The author did a great deal of research, I am now eating far less wheat products. I didn't get this book for losing weight, but weight loss is easy when you eliminate all wheat products.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Sharp Objects is another incredible novel by Gillian Flynn. Ms. Flynn captured me within the first chapter, and kept me hooked as she slowly revealed the thickening plot. If you love Law and Order and mystery crime novels you won't be able to put this one down!

B002NXSRW0|4.0|So, in reference to J.W.'s and Kirk's reviews. You both seem like a couple of haters. I grew up on the original cartoon, enjoyed the 1980's version and all of the action figures and \\"Joe\\" merchandise. Boo to you two.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love PLL, and I love that as the episodes aired, they were available on amazon.  I started watching PLL on Netflix, and was really bummed out when I flew through the first two seasons and had to wait who knows how long for the third.  Then I found amazon watch!  No more waiting!
0380725398|4.0|*SPOILERS<br /><br />I just re-read this book after a decade, and if anything, I enjoyed it more the second time around. There's no denying the story has flaws, particularly the constant references to the weakness of women and the ending, but it's positive points outweigh the negative for me. It's one of the best gothic novels ever written.<br /><br />For starters there is the creepy run-down inn located on the lonely moors and inhabited by the violent, murderous Joss Merlyn and his downtrodden wife, Patience. Into this world comes Mary Yellan, a young woman with no other family in the world who has led a very sheltered life with her mother up to this point. She is immediately appalled by house and it's landlord, and only her loyaltly to her aunt Patience compells her to stay. When the true horror of Joss Merlyn's illegal activities become known to her Mary has to decide what to do. Into this mix is thrown Jem, the landlord's horse-thieving brother who also manages to steal Mary's heart, and the ambiguous albino vicar of Altarnun.<br /><br />The landscape plays a prominent part in the story and the descriptions of the moors are beautiful and haunting. Like all great gothic novels, the erotic tensions simmer just below the surface. My interpretation might be controversial but I believe it is obvious from the start that Mary is sexually attracted to the brooding Joss Merlyn even though she tells herself she despises him. Her attraction is evident right after she meets him when she notices that his hands are capable of both extreme violence and gracefulness, and she is unsettled by this. She constantly sees him reflected in his brother Jem, and there is one scene towards the end, where he runs his finger across her cheek and tells her if he was younger he would have courted her and riden away with her to glory.<br /><br />\\"She went then to her bed and sat upon it, her hands in her lap; and for some reason forever unexplained, thrust away from her later and forgotten, side by side with the little old sins of childhood and those dreams never acknowledged to the sturdy day, she put her finger to her lips as he had done, and let them stray thence to her cheek and back again.\\"<br /><br />Jem is a less dangerous version of Joss, but he hasn't been completely tamed and still has some of the wildness in him that excites and frightens her. The vicar on the other hand is bloodless and without passion. Mary takes off her wet clothes and strips down to almost nothing in the carriage with him and he barely seems to notice, although she becomes self-conscious of his close presence and she fears he is going to attack her when they are alone on the moors at the end.<br /><br />Throughout the book there's a constant threat of sexual violence against Mary from both Joss and the drunken men at the inn. She struggles to contain her desire for Jem, much more consciously than older gothic heroines. I found it interesting that all of the terrible events that unfold on Christmas eve happen because she refuses to spend the night in Launceston with Jem. She even makes this connection herself. Usually women are punished for following their desires, but in this case it seems she is punished for not doing what she really wants to do.<br /><br />I know some people don't like the end because it seems completely out of character for Mary to suddenly just change her mind about returning to Helford and jump in the wagon with Jem, but it seems to me she has finally decided to throw caution to the wind and do what she wants to do. That means turning her back on the respectable world represented by the Bassats and the good folk of Helford for a life of adventure on the road

B00181MHQU|5.0|My 9 year old wanted to see this after her Spanish teacher played \\"America\\" in class.  We loved warching it together, the music and dancing is timeless.  I had to explain what prejudice is, which is a good sign.
B004SIMNF0|4.0|Pros:<br />Center of gravity is much lower, No neck strain, I can have my tripod plate attached, I can still use the vertical grip with everything attached, the tools hide away quite well, I can keep the flash on a pro body and keel if I need without worrying (and I'm not taller than 5' 9\\").<br />Cons:<br />The padding stitching is coming undone, the three-piece lock sometimes comes out after I stand up (from sitting).<br />Other thoughts: I use this with a vest on and it can be quite tricky not to get the ball part of the camera (for the lock) stuck on the vest, but I've gotten the hang of it. Aside from the quality of the stitching falling apart, I am quite happy I got this as the whole thing has been. It's much better than any neck strap on the market right now (I can keep the tripod plate on at all times and use the vertical button any time I wish).

B008O9V4C2|5.0|This the 4th Donald Fagen solo recording. With Fagen's music you can always expect tunes with catchy melodies, sophisticated harmonies, interesting riffs, great musicianship,and uncommon lyrics. Sunken Condos  meets all that criteria. My favorite cuts include Miss Marlene, I'm not the same without you, and Slinky Thing.

Em and Dex and/or Dex and Em...they are both characters that you will fall in love with (Okay, it may take a while to fall in love with Dexter!).  Kudos to David Nicholls for an amazing love story.  Now, I am ready to see the movie again...this time from start to finish.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton is a recent find for me.  This is her second novel I'm reading, the first being The Forgotton Garden.  This is a must read!!!! Beautifully written, you go from present to past with a fluidity that doesn't confuse. Everything jus flows naturally. The plot is amazing and surprising, to say the least.  One cannot readily predict what's coming next, though your suspicions are fulfilled. I especially like the way the narrator, Grace, tells her story.  The ending is a bit sad though, but a deserving end...<br /><br />I definitely have to download the other books this amazing author has to offer!!!!

This should be the very FIRST book you read before you begin your social campaign.  Filled with great examples and practical advice on how to make social media work for your company.  Well done!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden picks up where 'Down on the Upside' left off, and I am excited to say that 'Soundgarden' is truly back. I'll need to give it a few more listens before I decide on a favorite song, though if I had to choose now, Bones of Birds or Been Away Too Long would be my top choices. Highly recommended. I can't speak for the entire Soundgarden universe, but as a fan I can confidently say that I love this.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The cast is at the top of their game and the writing hit a very good stride for the fifth season of 'The Big Bang Theory'.<br /><br />It is obvious why Jim Parsons has won two Emmys for his portrayal of Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

4893580914|4.0|This book is truly helpful in guiding you to learn and memorise the different kanji. They have pictures, show you the order of writing the strokes as well as how you can apply the characters (both in Chinese and Japanese). It would be better if you use this book under the guidance of a teacher. I had numerous questions pertaining to the usage of some of the kanji characters but wasn't able to make any clarifications as I had no teacher to direct my queries to.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not the best written book by John Grisham and I was very disappointed.  Grisham's books are usually page turners, not this one.  I had to struggle to finish the book.
4883191028|4.0|This book is entirely in Japanese. No romanization. This is great as it offers you exposure to reading Japanese and quickens your ability to remember both the hiragana and katakana characters. Do ensure that you purchase the translation as well. You will need the translation as you won't be able to understand this book without that.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have to say first that this cd was eagerly anticipated by me.  Especially when I heard early what the song line up would be.  That being said, when I understood that 'Over the Rainbow' was one of the songs I was a little worried. Having grown up with the Judy Garland version it worried me that anyone else singing this would be a cheap knock off but Susan Boyles version is sensitive and different enough to make it her own.  I really enjoy this version, it seems refreshed and new.  'The Winner Takes It All' is touching and poignant. 'Send In The Clowns' was not one of my favorite songs, but I realize after hearing this version it was not the song but the singer that can make a song special.  I have a whole new opinion on this song and enjoy it as part of the whole. 'The Music Of The Night' Featuring Michael Crawford is elegant and rich and hauntingly beautiful.  Bring Him Home is extremely emotional and touching. In the song 'Memory' Susan shows her range and control. As Long As He Needs Me was one of my favorites, it is the Susan Boyle we fell in love with in the BGT audition, where she belts it out with so much raw emotion you can't help but feel it deeply affects her on some level, it certainly does you. 'All I Ask Of You' featuring Donny Osmond was the one I was most excited to hear as it is one of my favorite songs.  It does not disappoint and in fact I had to wipe tears from my eyes listening to it, it is so touching. Donny and Susan's voices blend in an perfect crescendo.  'Out Here On My Own' is another song that Susan sends you on an emotional roller coaster with, she was meant to sing this song.  'You'll Never Walk Alone' is a powerful song that Susan shows amazing range in.  It seems a hard song to sing but her voice is liltingly strong all the way to the end, she has some beautiful notes in this. 'This Is The Moment' featuring Donny Osmond will always remind me of Susan's trip to the states and being able to sing with her idol on Dancing With The Stars and in Las Vegas at the Flamingo.  They own this song for me.
B004JVXTL8|4.0|At times, it's repetitive with the camera shots and you sit there wondering when something is going to happen...and eventually things start to happen. Its definately scary at times..has that make u jump factor to it. I enjoyed it.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|Remachined is a very good tribute to one of the most talented bands on earth. I do wish that iron maiden chose a different song, seeing is space trucking is not one of my favorites. Flaming lips version of smoke on the water was way too funky for my taste. Chickenfoot, metallica, santana, and joe banamasa all bring great guitar work to one of the greatest guitarist's in the world's material. I would reccommend this disc to any purple fan.

B003YOZNBU|2.0|The new DC Comics movie \\"Jonah Hex\\" qualifies as a saddle-sore supernatural horse opera. Imagine the classic Clint Eastwood western \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" combined with the abominable Will Smith epic \\"Wild Wild West,\\" and you'll have a rough idea about what to expect from this outlandish, often incoherent, half-baked travesty. Despite its PG-13 rating, \\"Jonah Hex\\" boasts some rather brutal violence, but the consequences of the violence are rarely depicted. Josh Brolin toplines a capable cast as a cursed Confederate officer who has endured a near-death experience and possesses some bizarre powers. Ostensibly, this Warner Brothers' release brings into the limelight a little known DC Comics' character that appeared initially in the 1970s. Unfortunately, \\"Gamer\\" scenarists Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have changed several significant events and characters. First, we learn little about our anti-hero's origins. Second, Neveldine and Taylor neglect to delineate Jonah Hex's obvious supernatural capability. Mind you, Jonah Hex isn't immortal, but he can lay hands on dead men and temporarily resurrect them to satisfy his curiosity. Third, whatever charisma Neveldine and Taylor had going for them in their \\"Gamer\\" as well as their \\"Crank\\" movies never illuminates the screen in \\"Jonah Hex.\\" Reportedly, Neveldine and Taylor were supposed to helm \\"Jonah Hex,\\" but they left the film after creative differences with the studio.<br /><br />An American Civil War prologue depicts Jonah Hex as a valiant Confederate officer leading raids against Union troops. During his voice over narration, Jonah announces that war and he were made for each other. Things drastically change later when Hex refuses to obey an order to burn a civilian hospital with the patients trapped inside. The action is relayed in expository dialogue between our hero and a dead man. When Hex refused to carry out the order, he shot his best friend, Jeb Turnball (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of \\"Watchmen\\"), and Jeb's father, General Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich of \\"Shadow of a Vampire\\"), tracks Hex down after the war to exact vengeance. They tie Hex to an x-shaped cross and raze his house with his wife and young child trapped inside. Before Turnball leaves, the heartless villain wields smoldering branding iron with his initials and scorches the right side of Hex's face. Crow Indians find the tortured Hex later and perform various ritualistic ceremonies that endow our hero with supernatural powers. Hex appropriates a tomahawk, warms it until it glows, and burned off the initials. As a result, our vengeance-driven hero's face is twisted into a sneer on one side with a hole in his jaw near his teeth. Everybody that confronts Hex bothers him about what happened to his countenance. Usually, Hex kills them. Sadly, our protagonist learns to his chagrin that Turnball has died in a hotel fire. Anyhow, Hex turns to a life of bounty hunting after Turnball's demise. Hex establishes a relationship a frontier call girl, Lilah (Megan Fox of \\"Jennifer's Body\\"), who is crazy about him.<br /><br />Hex gets into trouble when he arrives in a two-bit town to get his bounty money for killing four brothers. Initially, the lawmen are not prepared to pay him off. They see only three bodies. Hex has the three corpses tied behind his horse, and he has dragged them through the desert. He expects them to pay him the vast sum of $100 for the quartet. One of the lawman observes that there was a fourth brother. Hex slings a bag with a head in it at the lawmen, and they decide not to honor their agreement with him. Instead, they aim to collect the $500 on Hex's head. A man with a rifle in the church bell tower blasts away at Hex, but this assassin is a terrible marksman. The lawmen empty their holsters to fire, too. Unveiling two Gatling guns hanging on either side of his horse, Hex wipes out everybody. Never mind that no horse could tote around such heavy armament. Concessions have to be made in larger-than-life movies like \\"Jonah Hex,\\" but Haywood doesn't make anything look cool. The Army arrives after Hex is getting out of bed with Lilah. They conscript him into the military at gun point. They have news that Quentin Turnball is alive. President Grant (Aiden Quinn of \\"Practical Magic\\") thinks Hex is the ideal hombre to track down murderous Turnball.<br /><br />Meantime, Turnball steals a massive, multi-barreled, revolving cannon devised by Eli Whitney, Sr., that will enable the user to flatten an entire town. The military has concealed the weapon. They feel that its power is too devastating. Predictably, Quentin Turnball thinks otherwise. He hijacks the train and uses dynamite to blow the Federal troops guarding the weapon sky high along with the civilian passengers. Women and children are among the soldiers. Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort, Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains, but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington, D.C., and then open fire on the centennial celebration.<br /><br />Of course, Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically, \\"Jonah Hex\\" suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable, and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy, but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded, long-haired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.vies like \\"Jonah Hex,\\" but Haywood doesn't make anything look cool.

Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort, Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains, but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington, D.C., and then open fire on the centennial celebration.<br /><br />Of course, Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically, \\"Jonah Hex\\" suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable, and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy, but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded, long-haired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|One of my all time favorite metal albums!  All of these years later it still rules....from start to finish!  Become the Catalyst!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Loved the book but disliked the ending. The book gets you involved in the story at the beginning. It is hard to put down.<br />Another great story by Grisham!
1400052181|5.0|I had to read this book as a summer assignment for my AP Biology class. Knowing I had a test on it the first day of school was the only thing pushing me to even read the book. Me being the procrastinator I am, waited until 2 days before school started to read the book. Who knew I would finish it in only a day and a half! I sat down to read it one morning with my coffee and I kept on and kept on. I couldn't put the book down!<br /><br />I respect all the time Rebecca Skloot put into researching the HeLa cells and the Lacks family because it created a marvelous book. It is a very easy and interesting read. The book can be very sad at times but all in all it is very uplifting.<br /><br />Typically, I wouldnt consider picking up a non-fiction book because they are generally assumed to be boring. This book is constantly keeping you on your toes and reads like a work of fiction.<br /><br />There simply is nothing negative to say about The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. It is a book I could read over and over and learn something new about science and cancer reasearch every time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this product is great real challenge  and forces you think if you do not love fun this is not the game for you
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Ok, the only bad thing about this is it's length versus the cost.<br /><br />The pure, unmitigated humor in this MORE than makes up for it though and if you have a cat you have to read it!!! Haven't looked at any of my cats the same since finishing it.
B008458O3S|5.0|At first I thought the game was too easy and boring. I mainly got it to see if it's something my kid would like. After playing it for a while I started getting into it. It's kind of challenging in the later levels. Great FAOTD. I'm glad I downloaded this one.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I think it's a masterpiece. There is not one single track I don't love. I can't wait for the second volume
B0090P98Z4|5.0|pretty good. cant pick a toon though.... graphics are looking good with plenty of action to take care of. over all fun times.
0811876373|5.0|(pun intended) but in all seriousness, this book is good for those who love the art of baking. Has many cute ideas. The price was good and I have no complaints on the seller. I'm happy she shares her talent and creations through book for us to use.
1451648537|3.0|The pages in book are ok, but the book didn't come with the hardback sleeve with the information that you normally get.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books in this trilogy are great. I loved being able to get it for a decent price in the app for my phone. I can't wait for the other two movies to premiere.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This one makes me want to go out and do good for others. Very good family movie without all the violence, etc.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Free is always good. Good book. Sad in a way. If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for? Get to it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Have enjoyed this game immensely...the music is very soothing as well.  Not nearly as repetitious as other games I have tried
B007MNV5WU|2.0|This is my favorite Angry Birds game. My issue is that it keeps crashing. The only thing I can think to do is uninstall it and then reinstall it. Of course that causes us to lose our progress. The first time I thought it was kind of cool because one of my kids did most of the game himself. This way I figured the others would get a chance to play the game. But after the 10th time, this is getting out of control. I don't understand how you pay $3 for something, even if it is only $3.. but I mean when we could have gotten the free version.. and it keeps doing this. It is getting very frustrating losing all of our progress.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a wonderful game I play everyday before I go to school and when I get home .best game ever.love it.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|Where's Waldo Now was very enjoyable. Wished there were more levels, so the fun didn't have to end. the graphics were awesome. The only critique I would have is that it would be they could do a better job of letting you know how many books you found in each level.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first few chapters were a little hard to get me into the story. I am not a fan of the back and forth point of views. If this isn't your thing either... stick it out! It is very much worth it. Wasn't a fan of the ending, well of the last page. One reviewer said it perfectly when they mentioned the aurthor must not have anything else to write so she just stopped. STILL A GREAT READ! I high recomend it, however it is not a \\"loanable\\" title for kindle, so you can't share it with your freinds.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|it should have a search so someone can search a word with out having to go through all the pages one by one<br />Because being at the age of 13 i have really bad anger issues and  i have gone through 4 of these Thing because 1 i have no idea how to use one and the help button is NO HELP AT ALL!!!!!!!!!<br />THANKS
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, and this app was free! Very easy to use on my kindle fire. Lots of neat ideas to see and share on Pinterest.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|I read most of the other reviews before buying this wonderful DVD.  Almost all rated it very highly.  However there was one review that put it down a peg referring to is as simply a NASA promotion.  However this was not the feeling that I got at all.  The sense of drama carrying out intricate repairs in space is real. The views as you 'travel' 'through' star systems is absolutely breath-taking. All in all a very good purchase and I have no regrets.<br />Peter
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is one of my sister's favorite movies and will make a wonderful Christmas gift for her. It was exactly what I ordered and in perfect condition. Thank you.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|the set was much smaller than expected for the large price. a little disappointing. its a christmas gift so I dont know how much they like it yet?
0316228532|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews about J.K. Rowling's new book, so it was with great reluctance that I finally decided to purchase it.  Actually, after I had lunch with a proper Brit, who described the book as a modern day Trollope novel, I took the plunge and ordered it.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have gone into explicit detail, so I'll avoid that and say this: Rowling has a solid grip on British society, and while she does use language, that merely reflects the culture she writes about; thus making her work more authentic.<br /><br />It may not be for everyone, but I found it to be an intelligent read!
1439152802|5.0|I usually don't like stories (or movies) that go back and forth in time, but Kate Morton's adept handling of doing so kept me enthralled in this thoroughly enjoyable story. I was hooked right away, and the story only got better with every turn of the page, and wrapped up with a wonderfully surprising twist (yet oh so satisfying) at the end. One of the best books I've read since The Help.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Legendary Child is probably the weakest song on this album. If they had played \\"Street Jesus\\" on Idol, this album would have sold 3x as many copies by now, but once they release \\"We All Fall Down\\" or the duet with Carrie Underwood I'm betting sales will boom.<br /><br />Sales aside, there is some honest to god Aero-goodness on this album. There is something for almost every generation Aerosmith fan, and some stuff you wouldn't expect. I have the deluxe with the cover of \\"Shakey Ground\\" at the end, and it was jaw dropping. A song or two is obviously leftover filler from past albums, but alot sound like they just went \\"Let's have some fun. We're Aerosmith\\". Joey and Tom have writing credits, for Pete's sake. I loved it!<br /><br />The disc with 3 bonus songs is most likely going to appeal to hard core fans, it's not bad but it is different. I haven't watched the video disc yet, I'm saving that for later! (I've waited a loong time for this, so I'm making it last!)<br /><br />Yes, people complain it's not \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Pump\\". But I think it's stirs the echoes and pulls off some new greatness in places. It was a long wait and I am not disappointed.
1451638450|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series is a long-running character-driven quasi-feudal space opera (with cast of thousands).

B007MDB548|5.0|After watching the movie, I was really surprised that it wasn't released in the theaters.  Not only did I enjoy the movie, but my 2 and 5 year old girls did as well.  It has a very nice story line, and the blu ray graphics were great.  I definitely recommend this to others.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love it because it has the new bird &quot;bubble gum bird&quot;it is really cool.it is my favorite game out of all them.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I started reading the Percy Jackson series as a way to have something in common with my 10 year old son. And I ended up getting hooked on the series. I enjoyed all the books and wish they eventually became a movie series or a television series.<br />Sun of Neptune was great and I highly recommend it
B00634GHJA|4.0|I own a Kindle Fire as well as an iPhone, iPod and iPad mini.  Before sering that I could have used one common app to forward my photos from an android device to an apple, I lost my mind and pestered my husband, because regarding techy things, I love to use them, but have the tec IQ of an ant.  Now, I tested this and found that this is one thing I CAN do alone.
B003N0XDT4|1.0|Sure can navigate through the menu if you have any technical knowledge. But I cannot seem to be able to use the amp if not plugged in. I will have to contact them. I notice very little improvement actually. Using Sony XB700s. Item states not to increase volume over 20 but goes much higher. Anything over 25 and there is a constant buzzing. However, if you leave volume low to avoid the buzz, then the volume of my Macbook doesn't give me enough volume. Essentially, the sound is better without the amp. Quality appears to be great. But if it doesn't improve the sound then there is no point in purchasing. Maybe I good be doing something wrong but there are no instructions aside of explanation of buttons and plugs. A simple plug/play with manual volume would serve me better so I might be returning this. Update: made numerous attempts to contact fiiO but due to language barrier...customer service was poor. Returning for a refund. My headphones sound just fine without this $70 purchase.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down I can't wait for the movie to come out. Although for hunger games I thought the book was better than the movie.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The movie had a pretty good natural flow with the story line, but lost some steam towards the end. The ending could have been written much better without changing too much dialog where the ending would have flowed with the rest of the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!!! It's challenging, addictive, and fun. So if you like to be challenged and have fun while you're at it, you will love this.  I was just out-of-town at a pre-Thanksgiving family gathering and literally all of the adults (11 of us) were rocking this game, on our Kindles Fires, iPhones, iPads, whatever.  Like I said it's addictive, but oh so much FUN:-)
1451662432|5.0|TOTAL RECALL... It's just an awesome book! Love it! Great work, Arni! Thanks for Your unbelievably true life story!!! Go President!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this album.  I have been waiting for Memory since Susan sang it in the BGT semi.  Wonderful duets, two with Donny Osmond and one with the Phantom himself, Michael Crawford. Susan sings with emotion, she feels the song.Standing Ovation is wonderful.
B00866H7SS|3.0|Story too simplistic. A poor copy of Shades of Grey.<br />Maybe if I had not read the other trilogy first, it might have more appeal
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I knew the premise going in, and tend to believe in life after life, so I was captivated by this story.  I admire Dr. Alexander for breaking new ground (personally and professionally) and exposing himself to professional derision in the process.  His story is compelling, and his arguments seem sound to this layman, and with proper consideration of the science around neural function and dysfunction.  Proof is a strong word and the brain is not yet totally understood, but it's a better place to be experiencing life after reading this fascinating account.
0670026182|5.0|I have been reading and cooking from Katie's beautifully photographed  blog &#34;What Katie Ate&#34; for a while now with every dish I have made being easy to create, visually stunning to look at and always amazing to eat ! A success every time.<br /><br /> I have recently moved to the US and a girlfriend sent me Katie's new book as a present, wow it is truly a beautiful book to read and cook from! I have many cook books, having just discovered that I have just shipped 3 big boxes of them over here and I must say that Katie's book is up there as one of my favorites . The recipes are easy to follow, the ingredients are easy to obtain and the dishes are practical from a quick Tuesday night meal to impressing guests for a dinner or party.<br /><br />When I first received the book I read from cover to cover in one sitting, it is one of the mot visually delectable books I own. The book now has pride of place on kitchen bench and my family have already gone through it and marking their future requests .<br /><br />This book would be a wonderful addition to any food lovers bookshelves and a great gift for anyone interested in food, cooking and looking at beautiful photographs!<br /><br />Can't wait to cook my next recipe!
B00846REIS|4.0|Although I enjoyed the book, the similarities to 50 Shades of Grey were almost frustrating. I look forward to the next book, but certainly hope it differentiates itself more.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|III albums in and I continue to be enthralled by Crystal Castles. Saw them at moogfest a year ago and thought that I had experienced the highest altitude I could listening to Alice, I was wrong, this album recaptures the energy of Alice Practice. My seven year old son LOVES this album and I can only hope that they will still be touring in eleven years when he is old enough to see them live.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turner! I thought I could guess the ending, but I didn't. Genius plot! Great writing! Surprising twists and turns. There were a few things I figured out, but it's so twisted you just can't guess. These are characters you love and hate at the same time. I highly recommend.
B008N1V11U|1.0|This app sucked. I never even got to play it. Every time I try to install it, it never finishes. So i am very unhappy that I wasted my money.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Pour finir ce très beau livre,profond et romantique a la fois. Les personnages sont vrais et attachants,l'intrigue vois tient éveillé même si vos yeux se ferment ...j'ai adoré !
8876250441|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, by far this is the best of the series. I would recommend this book to anyone. Breaking Dawn is a well written book that finishes off the series beautifully, the ending is nothing you would expect and the twists and turns make this novel exciting and suspenseful. Amazing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A shocking conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy! It wasn't my favorite of the 3, but I love it simply because I fell in love with the characters in the other books.
0307474275|5.0|I am finally reading this book.  Can't put it down!  Fact or fiction, it is really ood or thought.  Good transaction, too.  A+
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book! Totally loved it and very well written. The author explained a lot of things I was always curious to know
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was pretty nervous to see Daniel Craig's third installment as James Bond. While \\"Casino Royale\\" was awesome, I really hated \\"Quantum of Solace.\\" Fortunately I had absolutely nothing to worry about, because \\"Skyfall\\" is absolutely AMAZING! I will go out on a limb and call it the best Bond film of the past 20 years, hands-down. I don't want to give away any of the plot, so just take my word and go see this in the theatre...you will not be disappointed. The effects and fight sequences are amazing. The film also shows us another new side of Bond and dips into his past a bit, which is fascinating. I was not thrilled about the casting of Naomie Harris as one of the Bond girls, but thankfully she isn't nearly as annoying as she is in the \\"Pirates\\" movie franchise, and I love the revelation about her character at the end of the film...didn't see that coming! Javier Bardem has made a name for himself as one of the best Bond villains of all time. His character is a throwback to the evil Bond antagonists of yore, which was just so fun to watch unfold on screen. The one thing that may disappoint viewers is that, of all the Bond films I can remember, I think James has the least amount of sex in this one, but that's because the main Bond girl in this film is M. What a fantastic movie! I can't wait to watch it again.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I was worried they'd use the fade-out version of 'I Will Always Love You', as heard on [[ASIN:B00004R84V Whitney Houston - The Greatest Hits]] and practically every compilation since, but thankfully, they've returned to the original version for this collection. All other tracks also appear to be full-length original versions too. 'The Greatest Love Of All' is of course the single version which later replaced the original album version.<br /><br />The remastering is pretty good, although I noticed a difference immediately when the disc transitioned from Whitney's debut album tracks to 1987's 'Whitney' tracks... the earlier tracks were a bit lacking in bass. I haven't had a chance yet to extract one of the tracks and take a look at the waveform to see if the dynamics were ruined by amplification as most modern CDs are these days, so I have to go by what I'm hearing, an unbiased opinion, and I'm very pleased with the sound of the album. I'm guessing it actually still has dynamics, as I had to turn it up a bit :)<br /><br />Of course big fans are going to want a more complete collection, but that's really impossible to do on a single-disc collection. There is a 2-disc version available as an import from the UK but I think this single disc will give new fans a good representation of what Whitney's work was all about throughout her career and hopefully they will want to dig deeper and discover the other stuff after hearing the wonderful songs presented here.<br /><br />Update: Later on I was able to have a look at some wav files from the CD. Unfortunately it's a mixture.. I was right in that the CD is at a lower volume than many, and some tracks do appear to be properly remastered at a reasonable level without clipping or compression, but the sad news is that other tracks are obviously taken from previous loud masters and are chopped uniformly to reduce their volume.. another unfortunate side effect of the loudness wars is when they decide to go the other way, the whole waveform is chopped down like this. But I sound like one of those weird, obsessive Amazon reviewers now... the fact is, the CD sounds really good regardless :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because it is needed it is addicting every one loves it including me so I love it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Further proof for skepticals that there is another life after death .I think his experience will help many who are afraid to die.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I tested it out of the box and it worked great and had nice surround sound, etc. Anyone complaining about this product such as te bass isnt that great is picky as heck since it sounds perfectly fine to me and this headset is comfy, more so than any other i have tried and thats why i got this product. Lots of features as well, need no more than this for gaming thats for sure.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I actually didn't really know what this book was about when I bought it. I wanted a quick read for a short trip and I pulled this off the shelf at the bookstore based solely on a rumor it was a good book.  I don't know that I can say it was an easy read.  Well, the first 2/3rds were easier.  The last bit was hard and made me sad.  None of this is to say or imply that the writing is not exceptional and that the story is not worth reading.  It is both exceptionally well written and well worth your time and money.  I'm still digesting the story, which I think speaks volumes.  I haven't seen the movie so can't make that comparison.  I've loaned out my copy twice now and both of those readers really loved it too. So this is a three-person five-star review.  All say thumbs up!
B0091REZMW|2.0|how do I know if you have to pay or not? it won't let me do any thing! I got through the tutorial but now I cant press any of the buttons. I uninstalled from my kindle fire.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Using this to control an htpc downstairs with a Windows remote from an upstairs bedroom. Works great connecting the ir receiver. I plan to add a powered usb hub up top to allow more flexibility. Bottom line, thus cable appears to be a well made piece. So far it has done just what it should and for a very good price.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|It's daft punk, really how much more do I need to say? Nice blend of driving beats with some slower songs. Each song accents the next perfectly.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Really fun game for kids or adults. Always something to do but takes patience as well. No money needed to play game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked [[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer]] even though I never did think of the main character as being a racketeer.  Having finished the book shortly after it came out, I found the book enjoyable to read on my Kindle and I finished it within five or six days.  The story would probably make a pretty good movie, with enough twists and turns to keep it moving right along.
159562015X|5.0|We utilized this tool for a Team Building exercise for our department.  It worked out really well and was very helpful in understanding how our co-workers tick.  I would highly recommend to anyone!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved Fall of Giants and was pleasantly surprised when this came out. I was worried i'd have to wait a few years. Once again Follett excels at historical detail and for my money there aren't any authors who create and write evil characters any better than Mr. Follett. I'm not finished with the book yet, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the continuing adventures of the families we first met in FOG.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I just love this movie. Its long been a favorite, and I finally broke down and bought my own copy. The actors are spot on, and although the script takes a few leniencies with the original material, I love it just the same.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|this is basically a vampire movie with a twist. the book is much much better. the acting is OK. music is OK.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|This movie is exactly what I expected it to be (hahahaha).  It was a cheesy take on the \\"process.\\"  Mildly entertaining and I think my wife liked it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This began engagingly.  There was a man with a dilemma, a mystery.  But I quickly figured it out.  Then the plot spiraled into something preposterous.  I prefer my characters to be both flawed and good.  I prefer my plots to seem reasonable, sensible, possible.  This was a hot mess.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read every one of Nelson DeMille's books and love them. John Corey is my favorite character and this is in keeping with his previous form. So the book was wonderful and you should read it at once.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I gave this a five because it is appropriate book. I would recommend it to every body in the whole entire world.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best show on TV.......excellent production and direction......You don't know who will go next!! What's in store for our group next???
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is really a different way of telling a story. I like it a lot.<br /><br />I first started with loving Amy and hating Nick, then started grasping the whole story.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|My husband loves this movie so much he has watched it at least a dozen times since we've gotten it!
B003XYE7R2|5.0|A brilliant book. How do I describe it? It was a little un-ordinary for a Sherlock Holmes. I suppose it was the element of supernatural in it. But in the end it was still a good old Sherlock Holmes mystery. Brilliant. Loved it.
B00002SSKI|5.0|This Movie has it all ..Comedy Drama and Tears,,Reminds me of when I was growing up! From the &#34; Bermuda&#34; Shorts to the Bike riding all over town!
B004P9FAL6|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince with OVER an hour of extras. Enough said. HP and cinema fans; this is a MUST have.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This too is a GREAT Date night movie! OR a Great movie to watch alone on a cold winter night all snuggled up with a cozy blanket and hot chocolate!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|i assumed it would be absolutely terrible, i mean ole abe hunting vampires?! but i still wanted to see it. glad i did! much better than i expected. loved how it intergrated known facts about abe and his fam, but flipped it to make it \\"fit\\" the story line. overall a good movie
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I don't care what every one else thinks of Tom Cruise..He is still one of my favorite Actors, and he is Great in this movie!
B005LAIGPA|2.0|Chronicle(released Feb/12)stars Dane DeHaan as Andrew Detmer,Michael B. Jordan as Steve Montgomery,Alex Russell as Matt Garetty,Michael Kelly as Richard Detmer,Ashley Hinshaw as Casey Letter and others.This is yet another Blair Witch Project,this time done through the

B009A3NGF4|5.0|Though some people may think that all of Mumford's songs sound the same, they're not. Babel tells such a different story than their earlier album \\"Sigh No More,\\" and I love them both. It is their sound that I like listening to and this is what they are so good at maintaining in each CD. Though this unified sound may turn people away because \\"they all sound the same,\\" this is what hope for and expect in each album. So I would say for those people who think they all sound the same, go back and listen to each track of \\"Sigh No More\\" and \\"Babel\\" and compare the stories that each one tells- they are vastly different and equally enjoyable.

030758836X|5.0|I think I can confidently say, after reading this book, that I'm a total member of the Gillian Flynn fan club. Gone Girl is a stunning piece of fiction, excellently delivered and expertly wielded by Flynn.<br /><br />Told through two parallel story lines, Flynn's plot revolves around the disappearance of Amy Elliott Dunne, a former New York personality test writer. Immediately, probably because it's what's typical in cases like this, all the blame points toward her husband, Nick, another former writer from New York, who, after being laid off, moved his wife and himself back to Missouri to take care of his ailing parents. He now runs a bar with his twin sister, Margo. And they're both miserable. They both regret the decision to have come down in the first place. They both are starting to regret knowing each other.<br /><br />What keeps this from delving into your typical Law & Order: SVU sort of procedural are the voices. Yes, it's a book that realizes how to use first person, and knows how to use it well. Both Nick and Amy lie incessantly to each other and to the reader, so you can't trust what's going on line by line in the novel. There's a gray area between the competing narratives and that's about as close as you get to the truth here. Flynn questions, though, what is the truth? If one person sees something this way, and another this other way; if someone manages to make people think this, could that be true?<br /><br />The mystery itself serves as a backdrop to watching this deteriorating marriage, these tense, terse sequences between people who are having a difficult time caring for one another any more. At the end of every chapter, I wanted to take a breather, go for a walk, pet the dog, do something happy or whatever, but Flynn's writing is so captivating I just wanted to return to it.<br /><br />It's a bleak dark world, full of twists and turns. Flynn's knowledge of the genre, her sending the characters one way or the other because that's how people are expected to behave further adds to the suspense. They're trapped in a public conscious story, and they have to exploit it together to be able to win. It's stunningly strong, the emotions are earned, the action is intense (take a look at when Nick and some other guys go to an abandoned mall to confront some squatters), and the novel is probably one of the best of 2012.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham uses the \\"flawed hero\\" theme a lot.  However this time it is the \\"screwed hero\\" when he takes an innocent lawyer from prison to retirement.  As always it is a great read (pure fiction)and an informative review of the judicial system.  I can't wait for his next book!
0374214913|4.0|Is it really necessary to talk about Robin Sloan's background? Like how he used to be an executive at Twitter, how we published his stories under a Creative Commons license and created a serial fiction app called \\"Fish\\"? Should we take the approach this novel as its own entity, totally forgetting everything that came before it, or anything that might be coming out of it? I think to do so would circumvent everything Sloan brings up in his book, his themes and his ambitions.<br /><br />Freshly laid off Clay, in a desperate fit, finds employment at a 24-Hour bookstore (no, as Sloan points out in the beginning, not that kind of bookstore), whose customer base favors some eccentric people who appear late at night to come collect these mysterious books printed in an odd code in this very specific font. Curiosity takes over and he is set off on this mysterious adventure with secret cults, friendships, old rivalries, and Google.<br /><br />Sloan takes a lot and does his best to mold it into one little modest narrative. His focus is on that bridge between technologies, about what works best, what we're striving toward and how people are moving forward in trying to comprehend information. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't that long ago that books and codices were such a huge technological development, something people feared and were standoffish toward, which proclaimed the end of mankind as we know it. We're at a similar point right now, with computers and ereaders, a rapidly shifting world where thinking five years into the future, much less a thousand years, is nigh on impossible.<br /><br />But Sloan isn't dismissive of books. Although there are scenes at Google where snobby, jerk programmers who, through their arrogance and confidence, think they can crack anything, that they're the ones controlling the world now, are prominent, Sloan actually takes the time to show how some of the more traditional ways can lead to different discoveries as well. His argument isn'tso much one or the other, but whatever works the best for the task or the project at hand. It's not a dire book, no cynical or pessimistic, it doesn't have to rely on page-formatting gimmicks to make it interesting.<br /><br />At the same time, the novel feels like it's more full of ideas and allusions than characters. Sloan wants to channel a sort of Jorge Luis Borges/Umberto Eco but comes out as a more tech-savvy Carlos Ruis Zafon. (Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, because Zafon is an immensely entertaining writer, but it simply felt to me like Sloan was reaching for something bigger with his fantasy, some of the more universal themes you see in the Blind Master.) He makes deliberate nods to the fantasy troop archetype, the lead hero, the warrior, and the comic relief. In fact, if you didn't pick that up right away, Sloan also creates an entire fictional fantasy book sequence and Clay points out how he and his friends fit into each and every piece.<br /><br />This would be a lot more of a problem if the novel wasn't so much fun. Sloan's sense of humor and sense of wonder equally carry the narrative along to its quiet conclusion. And you do want to get through the mysteries of the books, of the hidden fonts, and Sloan brings it all together in a pretty satisfying manner. Maybe he didn't quite get everything he sought out for with this novel, but Sloan's created a solid entertainment, with lingering thoughts and considerations coming along with it.

I read it years ago, but still think that it is one of the best books that I ever read.  I buy and carry extra copies for other people.  I had watched all of the Winnie Pooh videos with my son, and it really makes sense to be like Pooh, and not to fret like Piglet, or be grouchy like Owl and Rabbit.  I just laughed.  Delightful and true.  I hope that I keep remembering to go with the flow!!!!!!!

0307596885|5.0|Alice Munro's short stories are so strong and so pungent that they resemble novels. Though she proves herself a continued master at telling stories, hers are less like other writer's short stories than they are like novellas. They are dense, rich in background information about every niche she explores, and the length of each story is longer than the reader expects. It is not until the last four works that Munro says represent the \\"first and last -- and closest -- things\\" she has to say about her own life. It's a fitting coda for a book that gives the impression of a writer sharing secrets, not in the sense of dirty laundry but in terms of storytelling sensibility.<br /><br />While her stories her are largely focused on a defining episode of a character's life, the stage setting for these stories allows us to piece together a broader history. Munro is a literary genius for selecting details that keep unfolding in the reader's mind.<br /><br />Her plots, seemingly simple and straightforward tales, build to big operatic scenes such as the drowning of a child in a gravel pit, a tyrannical patriarch arriving home to discover his meek wife throwing a lively party, a child wandering off on a train while her mother flirts with a friendly stranger, the story of a woman disfigured by a harelip who lets the chance of tender companionship with another woman slip through her fingers out of a combination of obstinacy, ego and fear.<br /><br />Her stories often occur around the Second World War as though at age 81 the author feels most comfortable painting her verbal canvases in an era more conducive to the types of stories she obviously loves to weave.<br /><br />Though every story in DEAR LIFE is successful, one of the strongest is `Amundsen,' the tale of an abortive engagement between a young teacher who takes a job at a tubercular hospital in a wintry rural outpost and the presiding doctor who is all business even when making love. The title refers to the town where the story is set, a backwater with a frozen lake, gray skies and \\"small untidy evergreens rolled up like sleepy bears.\\" Munro anchors the mystery of the couple's union and abrupt separation. Blame or faultfinding isn't part of the picture. Human nature follows laws every bit as unyielding as the weather. When the doctor says to his no longer bride-to-be, \\"Maybe someday you'll count this one of the luckiest days of your life,\\" it is possible to feel the cold gusts penetrating the car in which this final conversation takes place.<br /><br />Alice Munro remains one of the most powerful and successful storytellers of our time and this collection is mature in more ways than one!

B009186JYI|5.0|I watched it twice in two days during the same time I was reading the book Mick Jagger by Philip Norman (which I also recommend). It was great to see the gents as their epic journey was beginning. Brian Jones was articulate and playful; his ending quote was ironic. Jagger was ego, but playful, articulate, intelligent, and oy!!! what a performer. Keith was playful, Bill Wyman was ironic, and Charlie Watts (thus the title) was engaging and animated. Who knew!?!? Having attended RS concerts, this footage showed me that I wish I had seen them at the inception of the RS. They were truly their bluesy selves. The Irish audience was in awe and quite unruly. Check-out the priest - even he got into the funk. Charlie is My Darling is worth the price. It can be viewed for a variety of purposes; but it all goes back to the gents. Andrew Oldman, who was in charge if this footage and the RS at the time, deserves some credit for documenting these important moments in music and cultural history.
B00723NWJE|5.0|She never ceases to amaze me.  The more I listen to her music makes me want more.  She's awesome!!  If you haven't listened to her music, I recommend you do.  Her type and style of music is so diverse!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It just keeps getting better.  It begins a bit slow, and then it just starts to unfold with each new narrator.  The form of the book echoes the meaning of the story in a wonderful way.  I thought it was a terrific mousetrap of a story.  All the parts function together.  If you're expecting to have a huge epiphany after the last paragraph of the book, and suddenly understand the meaning of the Universe, you'll probably be disappointed.  This story doesn't really give up answers.  It's more like a gem you can turn over and over, admiring its different facets.  And the language it FANTASTC! If you love language, it's a banquet, especially the later narrators.  Great fun!

BOY was I wrong..... just plain bad
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Pretty typical Wes Anderson. The characters are very good ( the actors too) and hard to believe the young leads are only 12! Makes you stop to think about how we behave as adults with our children and is packed with subtle yet truly Wes scenes. Very highly recommended.

The artwork and design are quite beatiful, and the game play is simple but engaging. I can't really commment on the music or sounds since I play with the sound muted... Maybe I should listen sometime, as if they've put as much thought into the sound as they have the rest of the app, I'm sure it's great. Well worth the price!
B0053O89JM|3.0|Purchased this for my mother who adores House.  The episodes are great, but 2 of the DVD's are defective.  One, I eventually was able to get to play, but the other one has a huge scratch and will not load.  No idea how new DVD's get scratched.  All of them take a LONG time to load - so I'm not sure if all of them are a little defective or it's some copy protection thing they put on them that my player doesn't like.  Now I have to figure out how to send this back.  I never expected to get damaged DVDs that were brand new and sealed.

B009NPM5Y2|3.0|This was more of a chick-flick than I expected.  I can respect/enjoy a good chick-flick, but this one wasn't even that good. I was pretty bored throughout the movie.  The music is ok, and a few of the actors perform well, but overall I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really desperate for a popcorn flick.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|I really needed this and It finally came...Thanks Goodness.  With the high expectations of Birthday Massacre Hide and Seek, Shiny toy Guns III, Madonna's one song (GanG BanG) stinker and the lack luster Ladytron- Gravity the Seducer. This album is exactly what I needed and was expecting from Crystal Castles. This is better than there first two efforts hands down. The first album was a good start and the second was more polished. \\"Suffocation\\" was easily my favorite off the second but the second has its inconsistencies. This album has none it flows like one long painting and the mood is beautiful. \\"Affection,Kerosene, Wrath of God,Pale Flesh and Sad Eyes are impeccable! I think every band reaches there climax and this may be theirs. The next album I am not going to have such high hopes because after something like this ? There is always room for disappointment , hopefully this will be a new beginning.<br /><br />Thanks for the great music !
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is in some ways the logical culmination of the Bond reboot with Daniel Craig. It focuses much more on plot and character than almost any other Bond film I can recall. There's much to love about the film. However, ultimately Skyfall is hampered by its inability to completely break with the past. Here are some thoughts:<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Brilliant directing. There are some scenes, such as the Shanghai skyscraper, that make excellent use of lighting and locale. Great camera angles, such as the shots of Bond going through the tests. The film is generally well paced and never too predictable.<br /><br />The acting is superb for a Bond movie. Daniel Craig's Bond really comes across as a three-dimensional character. He's a very real person facing very real emotional struggles. We learn a bit about Bond's history and where he grew up. Moreover, Judi Dench as M finally becomes a character, not just a face behind a desk. The movie takes both characters and elaborates upon the themes of aging gracefully. It generally works well<br /><br />Again, Skyfall is a Bond film, not an Indie movie. However, at times it seems to be reaching for something greater than simply yet another Bond film.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />Skyfall reaches so high and generally succeeds. But in a few areas it struggles to reconcile its status as a Bond film with the director's obviously grander vision. This is particularly true in how it handles the villain and the women.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br /><br />The Villain, played by Javier Bardem, is an ex-MI6 agent who has become disillusioned with the secret service and furious at M for handing him over to the Chinese. The motivation seems a bit silly and overworn (basically like Trevelyn in Goldeneye). Unfortunately, Bardem's Villain comes across as too flamboyant and omnipotent for an otherwise serious film. Like the worst of Bond villains, he's omnipotent and omniscient. He has a hacking program that gives him access to any computer in the world. He seems able to plan everything and anything in advance and apparently has infiltrated the London police at the highest levels. How he does this of course is unknown. It comes across as lazy scriptwriting (note to future scriptwriters: the super-duper hacker program is not interesting or threatening, it's boring and over-used). Bardem's character never plunges to the ridiculous depths of Moonraker's tycoon, but nor does he stand out as particularly interesting.<br /><br />A bigger problem with the movie is the female roles - aside from M. There are two potential Bond girls. We get a new actress for Moneypenny who starts off as a field agent and then switches to a desk job. The character has potential in the beginning, but then there's an awkward scene when she starts flirting with Bond, with cringe-inducing lines like \\"sometimes the old ways are the best.\\" She drops out of the film about halfway through. Second, Bardem's mistress has a brief conversation with Bond. Next thing you know, he sneaks into the shower with her. Talk about quick!<br /><br />For both Bond girls the females never came across as strong or interesting characters. When the Bond films focused on guns, girls, and gadgets, the ease with which women fell to Bond's charms was funny. It fit with the spirit of the film. Bond films were part of the joke. However, in Skyfall, they seem out of place. Neither female seems equal to Craig's Bond. Fortunately, M as the motherly figure makes up for the glaring lack of a strong female, but I hope the next film finds a strong female character.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Overall 4.5 stars. Skyfall is definitely worth seeing for Bond fans and will appeal to most fans of action films. It's possibly the best Bond film ever and I'm encouraged by the direction of the franchise. Not perfect, but very good.
B009YU62H2|4.0|The Bottom Line:  While it leans most heavily on the Badmotorfinger, King Animal also draws from the sound of Soundgarden's other two major hits Superunknown and Down on the Upside.  While they really don't break any new ground, there's something to like for most fans.  For more details read on.<br /><br />The first five songs on King Animal remind me a lot of what I heard back with \\"Outshined\\" or \\"Rusty Cage\\".  Listeners will find plenty of distorted, driven guitar matched with Chris Cornell's screams, and they will quickly reach for their drab and ratty sweaters that were ubiquitous in the Grunge Era.  It was like a trip back in time, and the opener \\"Been Away Too Long\\" could almost be taken as a statement for Soundgarden overall.  After they listen to King Animal, most will agree they have been away too long.<br /><br />The transition from Badmotorfinger begins with \\"Bones Of Birds\\", but \\"Taree\\" brings the sound squarely into the Superunknown era.  The vocal hooks on the verses are quite strong, and to me this is easily the catchiest song on the album.  I also found the rhythm of the vocals on the opening verse very similar to Nirvana's \\"Heart Shaped Box\\".<br /><br />Then on \\"Black Saturday\\" and \\"Halfway There\\" acoustic guitars come in placing us square in the Down on the Upside sound.  However the album doesn't stay here until the end.  Both \\"Worse Dreams\\" and \\"Eyelids Mouth\\" lead off with heavy bass lines that almost sound like Flee has stopped in for a visit.  I think that both of these songs and the somewhat repetitive closer \\"Rowing\\" stand apart from the rest of the album, and it is here that Soundgarden sounds freshest.  These are going to require a little more time to grow on me, but they have potential.<br /><br />In the end, I think that most Soundgarden fans will like King Animal, and I think it is a no-brainer buy.<br /><br />Download this:  Been Away Too Long

Contacted customer service over chat, they could not find an uncensored version, but did let me return the rental for a refund.  This did not help me watch the movie therefor the one star review

I need my Kindle to have this tome easily read in bed without a heavy paper edition.  Martin weaves a formidable tale of intrigue around lives that are comparable to today's political scene.  Can't wait to find who out-wits-whom when the smoke clears.  Fantasy has a solid base in reality even though it's set in a by-gone time.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|Not just a slasher! Really makes you think and piece it all together! Great horror/psychological thriller! I convinced a friend to see it, and it becomes about the who is doing what rather than the blood and gore.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read a sample of this book and it didn't appeal to me, but so many people said how wondweful it was, that I decided to see if I missed something in the story and purchased the book. It was an ok book and maybe because I figured right from the start that she wasn't dead that I couldn't say it would be a favorite.
B005QUQP76|5.0|The mouse is absolutely fantastic for FPS games. I'm incredibly pleased with it's performance and it's nice and heavy as I like it. I did have to contact Corsair support as I was having detection(during boot) issues with the mouse after a firmware update, and they didn't hesitate to offer a replacement to resolve the issue I was having. Their support is great and I'm planning on getting the FPS keyboard they have.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Characterization stretches credibility in some places but on the whole I found it moving, gripping and engrossing. Hard to put down and I looked forward to coming back to it.
0446580848|2.0|Not sure what happened.  This story fell flat for the first 75 chapters, then for a few pages DeMille was back on his game.  In total I'm sorry I spent the $ for this book as the whole thing was redundant. No real story line like his other books. Maybe he was not feeling well or in a coma while writting this.<br /><br />SharonV
1936608618|5.0|This book is a must have for all endurance athletes!  The details, descriptions and illustrations are superb in every way.  Once you get your hands on this book you cant put it down!  If you are a coach, you definitely cant pass this book up.  For all the valuable information in this book you would expect to pay twice as much for it.
0345529057|5.0|Martin's books are excellent.  I highly recommend them for anyone who likes adventure or fantasy books.  Be prepared though for surprises you might not like.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was an unexpected awesome movie. The one liners were amazingly funny!! I would love to watch again.  Worth 1.99 to rent it.
B009SCRERI|5.0|What a refreshing treat to have a \\"G\\" rated movie that's cute and fun for the kids.  My 2 and 4 year old girls loved this movie.  My 6 and 11 year old also enjoyed it.  I think it's a great movie for all ages.
1936608618|5.0|As a strength and conditioning coach, Power, Speed, Endurance by Brian MacKenzie, has elevated my game by giving me all the steps that I need to progress my athletes through perfect technique in pose running, biking, swimming, and lifting. It also offers a great mobility section that addresses common injuries amongst endurance athletes. As one who often works with the weekend runner, biker, or triathlete I can attest to seeing many of them with nagging overuse injuries. Brian MacKenzie, with the help of Kelly Starrett, gives clear details on how to address endurance athletes common injuries or tight muscles, such as tight heel cords, hips, bothered knees, rounded posture and more. I love that this book clearly defines what they should be doing to overcome their injuries by correcting their movements and mobilizing to prevent future issues or heal current ones. Plus, I think it's important to note that this book has a ton of high-res photos that show you exactly what good or bad movements look like, as well as help you to assess athletes.<br />While this book does bring in CrossFit to help minimize your overall weekly training time, the emphasis is still on technique, which is what I found to be the best part of this book.<br />If you want a book that's easy to digest, then grab this book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Thanks for being there with a new cord for my original one's casing crumbled making it unsafe in my opinion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son bugged my for days to buy minecraft because every one of his friends plays it and it looks really cool. So I bought it. That kid loves playing it. Makes a good bribery tool :) lol
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am glad I purchased this book. It was very informative and detailed to make me keep reading. It is amazing what kind of physical training the military does and how they love it. I loved reading about how we came through and killed Osama bin Laden. I have told many to purchase this read.
B003XQ9BXU|5.0|This a great action movie, and different take on the Robin Hood legend. This one leads up to the Robin we have seen in so many movies and explains why he became a fugitive. the Director's cut has a lot of extra footage wgich we enjoyed even more.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another gripping tale by Lee Child superbly written keeps you going to the very last page. As fan of Jack No name Reacher  like all his stories hard to put down . Always eager to read. One of the first authors I look for.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game doesn't present the biggest graphics out there but it's a blast and requires a but of planning and strategy to avoid hazards. I stated playing today and have been at out for hours! oops
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Melody Gardot is one of the most unique young artists in the world today.  She harkens from Philly, but her soul is Parisian.  Her voice is soft, there is a lot of tremolo.  Think Sidney Bechet.  She sings songs in a style that is all her own and it transcends any established genre.  Almost coming out of the tradition of Edith Piaf, but not exactly.  She is, to quote Duke Ellington, \\"Beyond Category.\\"
B009JCL58G|3.0|Am I the only person who considers the sound track overrated?  A majority of the tracks are remixes of the same 2 melodies in Atlas March and The Cloud Atlas Sextet.  Both songs showcase a pretty melody, but I'm afraid that's all there is.  To listen to either track is to listen to the same two melodies ad infinitum.  There is no complexity to either song, no development, the music doesn't go anywhere. the melody is pretty but superficial, and quickly bore after the 5th iteration of repeatedly hearing the same chords, the same theme, the same notes.. again.  In summary: pretty? - yes and appropriate as a complement to a popular movie - but as a musical piece standing on it's own, the music of Cloud Atlas is neither a brilliant nor sophisticated piece of art.  It is what it is: a set of catchy melodies written to cater to popular taste.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Service was on time and packaging was actually above expectations.  The seller took extra care to pack this item well.  I appreciated that immensely.<br /><br />I like the size of the metal cup that comes with the canteen.  The carrying case has a good size (and very well made) belt loop which will make it easy to carry.  Great canteen.<br /><br />I highly recommend this seller and this item.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|I was really worried when i bought this album at first because the last stone sour record really ler me down! there where some good tracks on the last one but overall i expected a little better. When i started listing to house of gold and bones i could tell from the first few tracks that this was hands down a better album than the last. Dont get me wrong it is no come whatever may but it is far from a bad album! It has some really great tracks on it and it has a decent mix of hard songs and softer songs. It may take a little getting use to at first but it is hands down a good buy! I defentally reccomend picking this album up if your a stone sour fan i give a thumbs up
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a great app that is sort of like a build-your-own-city type game. The only problem with it is that every time a new thing came up on it (which was almost all the time, including the kindle sleeping) it made a annoying pinging noise and it was really bugging me.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Honestly, I have never seen a movie with more than 2 stars that did not completely stink in decades. This one broke the mold, DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg,Sheen, Baldwin and done by Scorcese and it was great. Everyone was great and the story moves, moves, moves. I usually fast forward slow parts of very long movies. There was nothing to fast forward here. As an aside, when is the Academy going to give Scorcese his just due.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|inpirasional and intresting to read. I was impressed how well written it was. Rick Riordan has once again amazed with writing
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Love the story and the writer.  A must read for Austen fans and all lovers of good love stories and classics.
B001NZB5GO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I had never seen Greta Garbo in a movie.  She was stunning. The themes in the film hold true today. I would recommend this film<br />for anyone interested in the history  of movies.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Informative, but not what I expected. For the non-medical there were words and terminology beyond understanding.<br />Also, I could not understand if there was a visit to heaven from a Christian point of view or from a new age point of view.<br />Having experienced an NDE myself, I witnessed things from another point of view more in line with the biblical.<br />I do believe the doctors account, but reading all the medical terminology, I found boring. Sorry Doc.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|From the moment that I started playing I have totally enjoyed this game! It is a really fun way to spend my time.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great movie! Lots of action and suspense. Kept me entertained on a 2 hour flight. Tom Cruise is such a good actor in the Mission Impossible series. I hope he will make another Mission movie.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Was wary about reading this after all the hype my friends had given it but have read the book in a matter of days. Could not put it down once I started and looking forward to reading the next two.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I did not personally play this game, but my 13 year old grandson did. He enjoyed playing it on our last road trip. Upon opening the game, he went directly to playing with little instruction. He said it was fun, but he liked Angry Birds better!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Are you looking for a little escapism? This book is not the answer, unless the emphasis is on little. This book grinds away with loads of details that seem wholly unnecessary to the thrust of the narrative. It reads as if Grisham wrote this over a weekend.
B000TERI3O|5.0|Love Merle Haggard and found this while looking to digitize my music collection. I still have lots of old stuff on Cassette.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|As an ending to the Rocky Balboa Saga this movie was absolutely what it needed! I was so satisfied with the ending to the series. Rocky had some really great speeches which were very moving. This movie is tear jerker not only because of the fantastic storyline and superb acting from Stallone, but because this is Rocky's last time out. Never again will we see the crowds chanting \\"Rocky, Rocky,\\" and never again will we see him be the underdog, lose, but still win with the heart and spirit that these films are so famous for. Also the loss of Adrian sends me absolutely over the edge. I will miss this most believable and beautiful romance as well as the local Philadelphia fighter that went the distance for us so long ago.
B001KL0WJW|5.0|This is the original, not that awful directors cut. Don't ever watch the directors cut, it completely ruins this great cult classic.<br /><br /> The best thing about the warriors is its unapologetic presentation of itself.  It is what it is. It is also one of the best \\"man-up\\" films out there. You don't run away from wimps, you stand and fight. I loved it when I first saw it in the theaters, and I still love it.
B007UW9WOQ|3.0|Recommended to me because I love sushi, but found it a little boring. Interesting but a little too much repetition .
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is a must see for anyone interested in zombies, humans, sociology, or metaphysics.  The writing is excellent, the cast is perfect, and it balances lulls in action with dramatic moments that will make you jump in your seat.  The first few minutes will hook you and then you'll be watching all the way to current episodes back to back.
B009JNXK88|5.0|If you are a fan of classic sidescrolling games this will be right up your alley. This game manages to be both difficult and a lot of fun. Great touch screen controls. Download this one right away!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This season has done an excellent job of bringing the show back to its roots and focusing on the stories of the main characters.  There is more background and intrigue than in previous seasons and I don't think they will run out of ideas anytime soon.
B009GE9Y44|4.0|Besides the story holding it down a bit the movie looks and sounds amazing! The scenery looks pretty close to real life. Great scenes amazing sound, definite worth renting
B009FZFONO|5.0|There's really nothing else I can say.  This season has been excellent, the writing is honed to a knife's edge and each episode feels like a roller coaster of emotions and creativity.  I love it and I can't get enough of it, and the darker it becomes the more interesting it seems to be.
B00802EYDO|2.0|Not what I expected.  I personally would not purchase again.  Just did not enjoy the music or the beat.  But that is just my opinion.  I know others did like the DVD.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|All in all, not as good as his other works. Pretty boring sums it up. A little too weird for my tastes. I would pass on this one.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Very different than other books of this category. Simple and captivating. Characters feel real and less of supernatural and more of emotions and story.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Without being too wordy, I'll just say:  Read this book.  Great characters, cool plot, funny, exciting, and compelling.  Stephenson's finesse with the English language is something to behold.  Read this book.
B005NFVZZG|5.0|The love triangle just makes this show better and better.  I find Elena a bit boring but the other characters are good and the twists and turns keep you guessing about how it will end.
0743497465|4.0|Some of Dan Brown's more recent novels have left me annoyed and disappointed.  Enjoying a thriller, especially the kind he writes, clearly requires the reader to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride, but there are limits to how far an author can stretch the story and still bring the reader along.  Thankfully, this book manages to stay within that stretchable limit.  Yes, the plot is implausible.  And yes, the research is lacking in some of the details.  But the central premise, that politics is a blood sport where the ends often justifies the means, is not only credible, but in light of the last election cycle, seems to be a logical conclusion.<br /><br />Senator Sedgwick Sexton is gaining in the polls as he campaigns for the Presidency by attacking waste in the Federal Government.  Among his targets is NASA, which he argues is inept and inefficient and has an unfair monopoly on the space industry.  So when NASA appears to have found incredible proof of extraterrestrial life, Sexton's campaign suddenly seems doomed.  However, when a group of independent experts, including an intelligence analyst who just happens to be Sexton's daughter, begin to question the validity of some of the evidence, they suddenly find themselves running for their lives.<br /><br />As the mystery unravels, the action escalates, keeping the reader guessing and making this book difficult to put down.  With a range of characters who all might conceivably have the motives to be behind these attacks, the reader is never quite sure who the true bad guys are until the very end.  Like other books in this genre, this is unlikely to ever be considered great literature, but if you are looking for pure entertainment and a look at what truly out-of-control politics might look like, this book will satisfy.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great casting.  Wonderful story line. Even though it was based on an Israeli series, it works well in the U.S.  Certainly makes you understand that saying &#34;there's a fine line between genius and insanity&#34;.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Good premise and special effects.  Good casting and acting as we'll... If you like scifi, give this one a view!
B005OP7162|5.0|Great show.  It keeps you coming back. Like the strong female lead, don't see enough of that in television shows.
B006LSZECO|2.0|[[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]] is very strong in the first 2/3 or so, then heads off into a preposterous ending. I felt stung after reading it. I don't recommend it to any readers except those who are most able to give their cognitive faculties into the hands of the author.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE The Weeknd. I'm so proud of his upcoming!! If you haven't already heard this, it's DEFINITELY worth the buy. Those who have heard most of these songs before can vouch for that. For $9.99 You can't beat it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have always been into all things zombie, but I didn't initially start watching the walking dead.  After my cousin continually bothered me to give it I try I finally gave in.  All I have to say is thank you for pestering me dear cousin!  The first season, although extremely short, set up the premise for a great show.  The second season, although it had more episodes, left me wanting so much more.  Don't get the wrong idea though, the second season was phenomenal.  I literally could not stop watching.  And now, with season three, the show has proven that they can't go wrong.  The Walking Dead is one of those few shows that keeps getting better and better.  Anyone can die at any time and you genuinely feel for the characters.  The start of season three has definitely lived up to the incredibly high bar set during season one.  Sundays are now my favorite day of the week.  I can't wait for the next episode.  If you like all things zombie like me, I can't recommend this show enough.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie was enjoyable, but slow to build.  As hyped up as it was, I guess I expected more.  3 Stars
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I AM HALF WAY THRU THIS BOOK.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT IT DOWN.  EAST TO READ, INFORMATIVE AND A MUST READ IN THESE TIMES OF QUESTIONING EVERYTHING.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app works very nicely on my Zeki  7 and the puzzles are beautiful and the play action is very smooth.
030758836X|5.0|This is a great read.  Well written and easy to follow.  I couldn't put it down!  I highly recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The \\"romance\\" was intriguing but the sex was unnecessarily graphic. Didn't care much for the main female character but was curious about the man. Will probably read the second book since the first left me feeling like I wasted my time. In all fairness, I am not generally \\"into\\" romance novels.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I could definitely tell Disney was actually TRYING in this movie. They knew people's interests in Disney would not be the same as it was back in the early 90's, but they used what people liked in \\"Little Mermaid\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Aladdin\\", and \\"The Lion King\\" for something new. I admit the story wasn't quite as easy to follow, but I figured it out and I had no problem with it. They were just trying something new. They tried to make new musical songs even though most were not as good as the other songs. The characters and theme are awesome, though. A hard-working young waitress who yearns to have their own restaurant, a lazy but fun-loving prince, a cajun firefly who is in love with a star, an evil voodoo magician, and my personal favorite, an alligator who plays a trumpet. The idea of the main characters ending up in the bayou  and need to get back to town is great! It reminds of me of some of the earlier enjoyable classics like \\"The Aristocats\\", \\"101 Dalmatians\\", and most likely, \\"The Rescuers\\". I do admit, the only thing I criticize about this movie is Dr. Facilier killing Ray. Ray is not my idea of a main character to die, unlike Kerchak from \\"Tarzan\\" All I can think to myself is, why couldn't Disney just have Ray just injured like Trusty from \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" or have him crippled like what the PS2 company did with Bentley in \\"Sly 2: Band of Thieves\\"?! Oh well. Since Ray got to be with true love in the end, I guess Ray's death is kind of important in the story. But the good stuff in this movie is just too darn good. I know for a fact that it renewed MY interest in Disney animation.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book is an eye opener, is not to be worshiped but to make its lessons part of our lives, and our families
0345803485|2.0|Heard so much about this series, REALLY tried to get into it ... purchase all 3 books and have not been able to get through the first few chapters of the first book.  Writing is HORRENDOUS!
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|It was just a terrible movie. Very plain and boring. I suggest viewers to watch any of the x-men episodes instead.
1439153663|4.0|Great book, but also sad.  Took me a few chapters to get into it, but ultimately enjoyed the read and learned too...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice addition to my apps. Works very well with no gliches. Would recomend this app to anyone. I always have my Kindle with me so I always have a calculator.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Did not know that this was a special edition, so was happily surprised. Had original case and cover with no scratches on the disc. Looked brand new though said it was used. Very happy.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|If you're tired of boring movies made in the states you definitely need to broaden your horizon and give this great action flick a chance.
B005FJ7EIC|4.0|I haven't seen a decent vamp flick since Lost Boys and the whole appocalyptic background really added to story.  Definitely a must have for any horror fan.
B0053TMP24|5.0|ok. rick riordan is awesome.The way he did it with to two most loved characters from each camp to be brainwashed was geinus
B008JH5CVS|2.0|I can only say this is a very cheap product. The settings are futurist settings and the acting performances are OK. But overall this is a quite cheap product in both story and produce budget.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very simple, but a fun distraction.  Enjoyable to play any time. Glad I picked up this free app of the day.
0061124958|3.0|It is a good quality hard-copy book and gives us a good feeling by holding it. And the content is classic.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So much fun: now I know what everybody is raving about!  I was surprised at the challenges and how fun this game turned out ro be.
B000GY729M|4.0|I am enjoying this album. There are a few songs I can't get into but for the most part it is very good.
B007SGM084|4.0|I haven't read to the end yet; I am almost there though ...finishing.<br />I like reading it; it flows quickly.<br />I think it touches our deeper female aspects. I see myself worried about my appearance and dreaming, not about sex, but about love. Every single woman would like to be loved like Christian loves Ana. The story being narrated by  Ana, 21, reproduces well the thinking and attitude of a young woman at her age. Also, it shows that even being worried about the other person's reaction, talking  is always important in the development of a relationship. Good!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Silly movie - Lincoln would probably turn over in his grave to see what they did to him.  Could have been about any vampire.  Kept my attention only because I like movies like this but it was a bit far fetched.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i found wool in this omnibus edition, and I saw the writers skill improve with the length of the books, by the end, I knew that I had stumbled upon one of the greatest books on the kindle loved it!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Xtina is truly back in business with this release. Although many say \\"Bionic\\" was a horrible album I disagree. Lotus seems to blend Stripped with Bionic therefore creating a great sound/feel. It is hard to distinguish what is an Album filler and what is not because all of the songs have single potential. Xtina does a lot of vocal acrobatics over techno/sonic beats which gives us an amazing album not fitting into the mold of pop at the moment being that her voice outshines all the other contemporary pop artists.<br /><br />STANDOUT TRACKS: Red Hot Kinda Love, Let there Be love, Just a Fool, and Army of Me. (The Lotus Intro is amazing as well)
B0093QFA0M|5.0|I am a history buff. I first watched this movie on VHS and always wished that the graphics were better. The realism of the battles visual wise were great. The sound quality was even better; should have gone to the right! If you want a dramatic period film to watch about our history; the original book dialog came from the book \\"Killer Angels\\" Almost word for word.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Wonderful toy and my son loves, loves this toy.  I would recommend this to every child who loves Beyblades. This gift would be good for Christmas.
B008RTE066|5.0|This is a great collectors' item for beatles fans especially those who love beatles eps in 45 vinyl. The vinyl sound in mono is  powerful and very alive!
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I was interested in trying this game, but after it installed, I went on to other things.  When I tried to open the app, it tried to open and went right back to my Kindle Fire home page.  Very disappointed.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|Say what you will about the Twilight books and movies.  While I'm a fan, I know perfectly well that they're dreadful and that most rational people won't like them.  However, I've always found the soundtracks to be really enjoyable stand-alones with a good mix of both artists and mood. (Maybe broody, but there are usually a few stompers like Muse's \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" and The Black Keys' \\"Chop and Change to liven things up a bit.) I think they've gotten the mix wrong here.  It's relentlessly downbeat and/or airy.  Does that fit with a movie where the Cullen family feels they're under the threat of imminent death the whole time?  Sure.  But there are light moments in the story, too (Emmett and Bella arm-wrestling, Bella and Edward realizing they've got an eternity of really great sex ahead of them) and the folks at Chop Shop should have tried a little harder to reflect that. And why did Christina Perri have to re-write \\"A Thousand Years\\" to reflect Bella's newly frozen status?  Ick.  Call me a sap, but I liked the original and this literal revamping is just silly.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I liked this film enough to buy it. It's fun! But while watching on premium cable, the film had been captioned for the hearing impaired and Amazon also listed it as CC. I just bought it and discovered that it's subtitled instead. The difference is that there are at least three singing pieces (including \\"A Guy Who Takes His Time\\") that have no lyrics provided on the screen. Whoever subtitled it deemed it unimportant. This is unacceptable!
1609611543|2.0|I read a little bit about this diet and was interested.  I read the first chapter and have laid off wheat for 8 weeks and have only lost 3 pounds.  All of that occurred in the first week.  I made it through a few chapters of the book, however it keeps repeating the same information over and over again.  Really, the information could be condensed into an article.  I was disappointed with the book and so far the eating program hasn't yielded the miraculous results that are talked about in the book.  I do not feel differently from having cut out wheat, because unfortunately I have substituted other foods for the wheat.  I agree with others that this is simply Atkins in disguise.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|With other calculators, whenever I've summed more than a couple numbers, I've always done it several times to insure that I didn't enter anything incorrectly. Don't have to with Calculator Plus - instead I just tap the display to review what I've entered! What a great idea!!
B0081KTI0E|5.0|This is a great movie with just the right tone for Halloween.  It's not not bloody or gruesome, just spooky and chilling with some unexpected twists.  Daniel Radcliff turns in a really good performance in one of of his earliest post \\"Harry Potter\\" roles.<br /> Well worth a look and  for my money, (no pun intended), a purchase.
0743289692|1.0|I know its the new thing to hate muslims, but just hate people than dont write books, it doesnt do much to read hate messages already presented by fox news, and i can watch fox news for free. I guess she has to make a living somehow and bashing people these days makes big bucks especially if you hate muslims, you can get alot of money from jews these days if you spread hate, propoganda, and lies without telling facts.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a delightful, whimsical, sweet film. The cast is full of real pros, and the off-kilter laughs are sprinkled throughout. Watch it more than once, it gets deeper each time.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Recorded the night after Live At Leeds, this is another great live performance - in fact not that different from its legendary predecessor. The mighty version of Magic Bus isn't repeated but the rest is - the great versions of Summertime Blues, Shakin' All Over and Young Man Blues especially. They're just as good, as is the rest. It's a proper live album rather than the modern, auto-tuned and otherwise airbrushed and adulterated stuff we're often served up. Daltrey produces some spine-tingling moments but also strains for some notes and suffers from some dodgy tuning sometimes (as do the backing vocals.) Towshend's guitar wanders out of tune sometimes, and there are some moments of near-shambles mixed in with with some sheer brilliance. It's real music being played by real people and, warts and all, is a terrific reminder of what a superb guitarist Townshend is under the antics and destruction, and that Keith Moon may have been madder than an exceptionally mad person on National Mad Day, but behind a drumkit he was a unique genius.<br /><br />Every Who fan will want this. Of course we will - as a self-respecting Who fan, I bought Live At Leeds when it came out and still have the vinyl album - bits and pieces and all - and then the expanded CD versions and I've got to have this, too. I'm not sure that this adds anything to Live at Leeds, really, but - come on - we're going to buy a live album recorded the night after that historic concert no matter what. If you're a Who fan, you'll love it - but then, you already knew that.<br /><br />(What follows is a personal reflection which you may not want to bother with. The thing is, although Live At Leeds a great live album - possibly the greatest in rock - I've not played it in the intervening 40-odd years nearly as much as Tommy, Who's Next, Quadrophenia and the rest. There are some great moments but I often find with live albums that you really had to be there. I saw The Who in concert only once (at Charlton Athletic's Valley ground in 1974, since you ask) and it was a stunning experience. Daltrey shone like a rebellious God with his golden curls, Townshend windmilled and leapt like a demon, Moon was...well, Keith Moon, and Entwhistle stood like a rock amid it all while I was among tens of thousands of people all swept away by the music we loved being played, just for us, right there and right then, by the men we so admired. Almost four decades on, I still remember it with a thrill. And that's the thing: a recording of it would probably be very good, but it wouldn't be the occasion, and that's what I find with live albums generally. I'm often glad to have heard them but don't go back to them that often. I suspect it will be like that with Live At Hull, too, but then - so what? I've got to have it so I know it's there in my collection.<br /><br />Sorry - rambling over.)lley ground in 1974, since you ask) and it was a stunning experience.

B001NP8PQW|5.0|I have been a Cure fan since the mid-80s when a friend first introduced me to them with their \\"Pornography\\" album while I was still in high-school.<br /><br />In 1989 I purchased \\"Disintegration\\" - which still remains not only my favorite Cure release, but also my favorite album of all time by any band. Period. \\"Disintegration\\" is quite possibly an album that I have listened to at least every single month since 1989.<br /><br />I admit, after Disintegration, I kind of lost interest in obtaining the more recent Cure releases until recently buying a copy of \\"Bloodflowers\\" a few days after purchasing and listening to this Blu-Ray. The Cure's 80's releases always held a special place in my heart, and now I am kicking myself for not obtaining \\"Bloodflowers\\" much sooner. I can understand now why Robert Smith has stated that these three albums define The Cure. \\"Bloodflowers\\" is much better than I expected and deserves a place in this Trilogy.<br /><br />Insofar as the blu-ray itself, I am happy with the visuals and sound quality. As for the performances, they are very tight on the whole and offer little deviation from the original studio releases - which is no bad thing at all.

B009A87ZKG|5.0|Any of you who have previously purchased \\"Patton\\" on DVD or Blu-ray already know the greatness of this fascinating portrayal of the flawed general.  For a war film to garner the oscar for best movie during the height of the Vietnam War was quite remarkable and the film deserved a remarkable Blu-ray disc.  This second remastered version scores on that count and is certainly worthy of purchase regardless of any other versions you have.  It's that good.  As soon as the opening scene begins it's cuts to the close ups of Patton's uniform just prior to his opening speech you know this is the highest level of detail and color accuracy you have ever witnessed for this film.  The dynamic range of the picture and the beautiful color will continue to surprise you.  I doubt if the film ever looked this good in the theaters.  The soundstage is broader and more detailed than ever and voices are crystal in their clarity.  The second disc of special features is icing on the cake.  This disc is very highly recommended and a must own!  Don't miss this one!

B007Z1FD7M|4.0|While this concert was very good, it did not include their hit, In the Court of King Crimson, which I suspect may be due to the fact that there are different members in this band.  However, the dvd is still worthwhile.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This scarcely needs a review because after 50 years practically everyone will know whether or not they like the Stones and most people considering this collection will know all the tracks on it very well indeed. It is worth saying, though, that this is a great collection. Obviously, any compilation like this will have some tracks you love and some you don't like so much, and some of your favourites will be missing (What - no Sister Morphine or Star...er...Star?) but as a \\"Best Of\\" collection I don't think you can do better. It is well selected and sounds fantastic: the digital transfers of the early stuff are particularly good and bring real life to the tracks without interfering with their original sound.<br /><br />I suspect that quite a lot of people considering whether or not to buy this will be in the same position as I am: I have a lot of Stones music on LP and cassette and for me this was a good way of getting some of the best of it on CD. You certainly get plenty of great stuff, and personally I found listening to this was like running my life on fast forward from the age of about 10, with pretty well every track conjuring up where I was at the time. It's also great to hear the evolution of the band from the early covers, through finding their distinctive identity around the time of Satisfaction and through all their phases since. Although I haven't always liked the direction they have taken, this is a reminder that the Rolling Stones really are one of the finest bands of the last 50 years and that Jagger and Richards are a truly great songwriting team. The full range of classics is here, from the storming rockers like Jumpin' Jack Flash through to the hauntingly beautiful Angie. Also included is their new (November 2012) single Doom And Gloom which I think is excellent - a real Stones belter and one of their best tracks in ages.<br /><br />The question, of course, is \\"Do I need another Stones Greatest Hits album?\\" the answer to which will depend on your own view and the state of your music collection. For me it's a great summary of their career containing some of my favourite ever tracks, and has made them available to me in CD format. If you want a good, well put-together collection of The Rolling Stones, you can't go wrong with this set.<br /><br />In short, it's only rock 'n roll, but...view and the state of your music collection.

055357342X|5.0|This book has so far been my favorite in the entire series. I'm used to a series getting slower and less interesting with each new book that is released, but George Martin is able to capture his audience attention, and spin the story in directions that are so unpredictable and yet at the same time you can't but agree that it is the most likely and realistic of outcomes. It is so difficult to know what to say about this book, without giving the plot away.  There are some big events that happen in this book, several weddings and not all that are happy, but most interesting. My favorite characters Bran, John and Aria continue to grow and learn who they are. Even when the Starks seem defeated there is always a glimmer of hope. I have to say that I love rooting for the underdog, and this book has plenty of it, and at the same time justice is dealt for some of the heinous crimes committed by characters in the previous books. And finally revelations are made that turns the story on its head, and a light goes off for the reader with the realization that comes with the truth. Masterfully crafted story, and I would recommend it to anyone. However, I would caution that you definitely want to read the first two books in the series, or a lot of what is written here will make little sense. The story was irresistible and I could not put it down.<br /><br />As for family friendliness, it remains a 1 out of 5. This is not something that I would recommend appropriate for someone under the age of 18. There is a lot of mature content. Although I skip over those portions, the story still holds up remarkably well.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina Aguilera can definitely sing, we all know that. But her studio albums (at least to this point) have been spaced apart and cluttered with filler and interludes that take away from the overall enjoyment of the album.<br /><br />Back in 2010, she released Bionic, which was largely experimental and certainly a commercial flop, selling about 300,000 copies to date. Part of the problem with that album was the fact that her voice was buried beneath too many layers of electronica, thus nullifying her best instrument. Another problem was the songwriting of Tricky Stewart, who has been unable to re-create the success of \\"Umbrella\\" which he wrote for Rihanna half a decade ago. Both those elements are absent here, and Aguilera has taken up much of the songwriting herself with the help of some notable songwriters such as Max Martin.<br /><br />By and large, \\"Lotus\\" works well. It is a step back into the pop she was singing when she was 19, and even though she is now 31 (big difference), she can pull it off because the songs are sensual and sound immediate. They are songs of personal growth and independence. And given the fact that there are a few potential huge hit singles here, this is the appropriate album for Xtina at this point in her career.

That's what I love about her books and her characters.
B005LAII08|5.0|First off, I should probably make note that Brave has received a lot of negative reviews with the consensus being that it's \\"Not Pixar's best movie.\\" I would like to point out that just because it is not their best movie, that does not mean that it should necessarily receive a bad review. Pixar has had a long standing history of fine animated films, being their best is quite a challenge. Saying that this is a bad movie for not being their best is like saying Shakespeare's Coriolanus is bad because it is not Hamlet. Also, this is far from their worst movie (Looking at you Cars 2). Brave is simply a fairy tale, and I say that with the highest compliments. After all, what were Disney classics like Snow White or Cinderella, but fairy tales? Fairy tales are meant to be somewhat simple stories that entertain and impart a moral. In that regard I think Brave is a huge success. I'm not saying it is Pixar's best film (though I would personally rank it there). I'm saying it shouldn't be dismissed.<br /><br />The plot follows a princess who is forced to... well, be rather princessy. She'd rather be an archer and could fight with the rest of them. Considering this is set in mythical Scotland, that's saying quite a bit. As her mother forces her into taking suitors, she goes to a witch in order to change her mother so that she may have her freedom. This backfires to say the least. For more than that I suggest you see the movie. The only other thing I will say is that for those who say that the bear sequences came out of nowhere, they were foreshadowed throughout the beginning. Watch it again.<br /><br />Enough about plot, on to technical aspects. Visually the film is stunning. The animation is grand, and Merida's hair looks amazingly real. I was honestly distracted from the plot a few times on my first view  just because I wanted to focus on the animation. Some scenes are simply breathtaking. The Blu-ray completely does honor to the visual look of the film and the 3D disc is someof the best 3D I've ever seen. While I am not a huge fan of 3D films personally, it adds a lot to the atmosphere of the old castles and the fog at night.<br /><br />There are enough special features to keep both kids and adults entertained, from Pixar's classic short films related to the movie to a very in depth commentary that animation fans will find very interesting.<br /><br />All in all, I have to give Brave as a movie a 4.5 by my own personal rating system. The film was an enjoyable fairy tale with a fun story and beautiful animation. The Blu-ray presentation is easily a 5 out of 5 and outclasses visually any other animated disk I've ever seen both in terms of 3D and standard presentation. Brave is easily one of the must own films this year.

B008NEMPTO|4.0|Alright, this is not a great movie. Look at the title. If you were expecting Citizen Kane, you'll be disappointed. This is a fine piece of entertainment though. A rather silly movie that proves to just be a fun watch. It's far from perfect and I certainly do have complaints. I think the movie takes itself too seriously. It could have probably used a bit more comedy as I found it impossible to take the plot as serious as the filmmakers seemed to.  I have not read the book on which this is based, so I do not know if there was a similar tone there, but I just felt that it could use a little more of a satirical touch. That said, it's still an entertaining if uneven movie.<br /><br />The fight scenes in the movie range from somewhat ridiculous (the horseback fight) to extremely entertaining (the train). Some of the ideas seem pretty clever, and I particularly liked Abe's first fight with a vampire. All of the cast members do a decent to good job, with some performances actually being fairly effective.<br /><br />Technical aspects: The blu-ray looks okay. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good looking movies recently (such as Brave) but this one seemed to be an average Blu-ray release. Better than DVD but not the film to show off your home theater system with. The 3D is acceptable, again not the best but there's nothing particularly wrong with it.<br /><br />Special features are rather basic with a trailer, music video and documentary. The most interesting feature is probably the commentary with writer Grahame-Smith, who ranges from very interesting (discussing Lincoln's actual life as a sort of superhero origin story) to rather dull (just describing the events you see on screen). Rather a mixed bag there.<br /><br />Would I recommend this movie? That would really depend. I found it entertaining, I had fun with it, but those looking for a movie with more comedy may be disappointed, as would film goers looking for an actually scary movie. This is just entertainment, not of the highest order, but an amusing diversion. If this sounds like something you would enjoy, you'll probably like it.the highest order, but an amusing diversion.

1451638450|3.0|There's enough material in _Captain Vorpatril's Alliance_ to make a good long short story. As a novel, it's mostly filler. It exists to bring closure to Ivan's personal life, and to occupy a gap in the internal series chronology.<br /><br />The book starts with a bang, true enough. Then, around page 130, it slows waaaaaay down. And that's how it stays. The remaining 290-odd pages are, more or less, a guided tour of Barrayar--a mixture of infodumps and references to other books in the series. There are no mysteries to be uncovered, no problems to be resolved: we readers know everything that's going on, and most of the characters do too, and in any case the stakes aren't very high.<br /><br />A story, in short, requires conflict. _Captain Vorpatril's Alliance_ hardly has any. The antagonist(s) who are introduced at the start of the book disappear around the aforementioned page-130 mark and are never seen again. For the bulk of the book, there's no antagonist in sight *at all*. The nominal foe during the \\"climax\\" is introduced very late in the book, has no particular motivation, is purely opportunistic, and in any case is only there for perhaps eight pages, covering one scene and part of another, total.<br /><br />Finally, during that \\"climax\\", Ivan does ... nothing. He sits there, along with 100% of the other on-stage characters, and waits to be rescued. I suppose we're intended to read this scene as an emotional rather than a physical closure, but there's no doubt and precious little jeopardy, so that doesn't work either. No character ever faces a real inner struggle, or any really hard decision. There's no uncertainty, no tension, either about what the protagonists *can* do, or what they *will* do.<br /><br />If you're a long-term Vorkosigan saga fan, you'll enjoy spending time with these characters. Other than that, there's not much to see here.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again! \\"The Last Man\\" is an adrenaline packed thrill ride that has more twists and turns than the world's great roller coasters. The book finds American assassin Mitch Rapp knee deep in a in conspiracy and mystery in post-Bin Laden Afghanistan.<br /><br />When Joe Rickman, the CIA's top head of clandestine operations in Afghanistan is kidnapped, a tsunami of epic proportions is set off in the various branches of governments and intelligence agencies around the region and in the United States.<br /><br />Who was behind this coordinated attack and how to recover Rickman becomes the CIA's top priority, for in the head of Rickman lies secrets that could cripple the clandestine operations of America and her allies.<br /><br />What begins as a simple mission gets more and more complicated as Rapp and his team get further into the operation.<br /><br />What makes this and every other Vince Flynn novel so good is the detail and realism that Flynn brings to the project. There have been many in the government, military and clandestine organizations over the years who have questioned where Flynn gets his information, because it is startlingly accurate.<br /><br />Flynn's novel shows some of the serious pitfalls in the U.S. government's current policy of reintegration in post-Bin Laden Afghanistan. While reading my pre-release copy of \\"The Last Man\\" from Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster,  the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya was brutally attacked. Flynn's novel helps readers understand some of the current tensions in the Middle East, with a look at the Taliban, Iranians, Pakistanis, Afghans, Russians, Swiss banks, and the United States.<br /><br />The Last Man is a welcome reunion of Mitch Rapp and our current day. Flynn's last two novels, \\"American Assassin,\\" and \\"Kill Shot,\\" were essentially prequels to the story of Rapp, and a very welcome addition to the narrative. Fans of Mitch Rapp will enjoy seeing what the assassin has been up to and enjoy catching up with a number of favorite characters along the way.<br /><br />\\"The Last Man\\" isn't Flynn's best novel, but it certainly a great read and a wonderful addition to the Mitch Rapp library.<br /><br />As in all of Flynn's novels the language is a bit rough with plenty of military bravado and assassin angst thrown in. The detailed descriptions of torture and assassinations may make some readers squeamish. All in all, \\"The Last Man,\\" is a great read that opens the eyes of readers into the complexities of the continuing war on terror.joy catching up with a number of favorite characters along the way.<br /><br />\\"The Last Man\\" isn't Flynn's best novel, but it certainly a great read and a wonderful addition to the Mitch Rapp library.<br /><br />As in all of Flynn's novels the language is a bit rough with plenty of military bravado and assassin angst thrown in.

While Peter certainly has his own ego problems he at least has the humanity to explore his darker side and talk about his falls. Its not all self promotion like Gene Simmons. The Catman is the first to admit he is a whiner in the book. I didnt think he did it to much. The guy has a lot to complain about with how he was treated but Gene and Paul. Hell, every KISS fan has a lot to complain about. Why anyone goes to see the imposters calling themselves KISS these days eludes me.<br /><br />An interesting story by a guy who may not have all his ducks in order, but at least he seems human which is more than I can say for Paul or Gene.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|Like all of Kate Morton's books, The Secret Keeper, a novel that is set in three different periods and follows the lives of three very different women, all linked by a terrible secret, is a rare treasure. This is because it's a story like those you used to read of old, when you were a child and believed that dreams could be fully inhabited, and that your wardrobe really could lead to other worlds, and boarding schools were invented simply to enjoy high teas with friends. This is what I think of as a rainy day novel, the type transports you out of your lounge room, off your cushion, and into another time and place; immerses you in the lives of others making you care, dislike or even love them deeply. So much so, that when the tale ends, you feel as if a little part of you has dimmed.  So it is with Morton's fourth book and, in my mind, one of her best. The Secret Keeper, as the blurb on the back teases, starts in a sleepy, gentle 1961, when young Laurel, a teenager on the brink of womanhood, witnesses her mother, Dorothy, plunging a knife into a strange man's chest, killing him instantly.  Propelled away from the violence and into 2011, we meet Laurel once again, this time as an accomplished actor in her sixties at the twilight of a brilliant career. Dorothy is about to turn ninety and all the children are summoned home to be beside her, knowing her days are finite and precious. One of five siblings, Laurel is the eldest and, being back with her mother conjures up memories of her past and that inexplicable day when her dreamy, imaginative mother committed a terrible crime - a crime for which she was never held accountable and which Laurel has always kept secret.  As her mother's health fades, Laurel determines to uncover the secret that she has kept, to find out who the murdered man was to her mother and what prompted her parent to act in such a way. Discovering a photo she's never seen before, an inscription in a book that bears the name Vivian, Laurel is given herfirst clues and so, with the help of her brother, Gerard, she sets out to solve the mystery that's shrouded her entire life.  This is a sublime novel that moves between 1941 and the London Blitz, to 1961 and then forward to contemporary times, shifting gently, like a soft pressure on the back, as if in a slow dance. It also segues from England to Australia and, in doing so, captures the lives and mores of different women in very different eras. Through the eyes of ambitious, romantic and fanciful Dorothy, who believes herself born to be exceptional, we come to war-torn London, where women worked in service and for their country. Physically attractive, Dorothy turns her back on her family in order to tread the path she believes the fates have carved just for her. Meeting Jimmy, a photographer with an eye for beauty and a loyal heart, she finds love, but it's when she becomes the companion of an elderly rich woman and meets her neighbour, the enigmatic and beautiful Vivian, married to a famous author, that more than fate intervenes with tragic consequences.  Then, there's Vivian herself, a child of the antipodes who, through terrible circumstances finds herself in England and at the whim of cruel and dangerous forces, which work to shape and change her.  From different classes and with very different outlooks on life, Laurel cannot fathom what brought her mother into Vivian's sphere or vice-a-versa, but as she slowly uncovers letters, journals and more pictures, and begins to make the connections, Laurel begins to understand that she's not the only one keeping secrets...  Morton has very much made secrets, letters, memories and diaries, the never mind photographs and stories within stories part of her very female (but not so it excludes male readers, many of whom I know devour her books too) ouevre. In her gifted hands and wonderful imagination, she uses these tropes deftly and smoothly, allowing different voices to share in the story in which readers inevitably become lost.  There is something lilting and magical about Morton's prose, her turn of phrase; her exquisite way of rendering the ordinary extraordinary. One example is when Dorothy (Dolly) is working for her peevish lady: `\\"Perish the thought,\\" Dolly said, posting the boiled sweet through her mistress' pursed lips.'  The simple word \\"posting\\" (think what else could have been used) is so perfect and transforms what Dolly is doing, making the action something you don't just read about, but witness. That's the beauty of Morton's writing - it appears effortless, flows, but words like that reveal the thought and choice that goes into every sentence. A friend of mine (a fellow writer) once wrote that she had word-envy when reading a particular author. I understand that emotion when reading Morton.  What I particularly liked in this book as well is that Morton is not above giving the critics a bit of a serve. At one point in the novel, she has Laurel reflecting on her prefect childhood:   \\"The sort of home life that was written about by sentimental novelists in the type of books branded nostalgic by critics. (Until that whole business with the knife. That's more like it the critics would have puffed.).\\"  Managing to be both self-aware and slightly self-deprecating at the same time she also silences those who might suggest (as some reviewers have) that Morton has become too formulaic, almost saying, what's wrong with that? Or I choose to write this way. I cheered when I read that and thought what's wrong with capturing a corner of the market like Morton has and relishing \\"nostalgia\\" and \\"family drama\\", celebrating it and making that niche your own? For this is what Morton has certainly done. Not that there's anything wrong with that - not when novels like this are produced.  The Secret Keeper is best described as a delicious book. It's something you'll want to savour, to reflect upon, to appreciate for the work of literary art that it is before you return for a second and thirdserve.   This review (and many others) also appears on my website: [...]

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game so excited I can have it on my kindle fire hd! I have been waiting for it to be available!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Crisham always delivers a great story. This one may be his best. I got it on my iPad and could not put it down finnaly went to bed a 3;30 in the morning.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a devoted John Grisham reader, but found that his last few books tended to be predictable.  I was thrilled to see that this was not the case with \\"THE RACKETEER\\" !!  My husband and I both read the book and neither of us could put it down.  I would rate it as one of my favorite Grisham books.  I am always intrigued to learn the way the law works with each of his book scenarios, and this one  is just amazing.  Just when you think you have everything figured out, there's a twist and a whole new direction in the plot!<br />I have recommended this book to friends and family--read it-- you won't be disappointed!!
B004I744AS|3.0|it was ok I wish it was off line and that it included pic and you could clear history other than that is ok
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It only gives you about 5 minutes to play and then it says you have to buy it and if you don't it won't let you play that world anymore. SUCKS!
007174889X|5.0|I've been accquainted with Harrison's since 1984 and this is my third edition purchase.  The quality and richness of the photos and design are very impressive; also well organized chapters. I was used to the one volume book, but this one comes in two volumes; however, as a reference textbook I find find it quite approppriate. It's my opinion this to be the \\"bible\\" for Internal Medicine, and the additions of new chapters, plus the dvd makes all well worth it. This is a 'must have' for anyone who wants to become a more well-rounded clinician, and guaranteed, you will not be dissapointed. I was very pleased with the price and expediency from Amazon... Great customer service.
B00364K6YW|2.0|I bought the 2010 restored edition, it is worst than the original dvd I had and broke. The colour and brightness changes with each episode, if not every scene, and I have to adjust my screen settings every 10 mn. May be my copy was bad, but it is a deception.
B008NABUU8|3.0|I have fun playing with it, although I wish there was a bit more in the way of tutorials, especially for the more advanced levels.<br /><br />Seems to freeze a lot on my first-gen kindle fire, though. Often requires a full restart of the device.
0930289234|3.0|Bought this because of all the hype.  It's good, but not THAT good.  Worth reading, but maybe not worth buying.<br />If you aren't familiar with graphic novel, you might be surprised by how good the story and writing are, but personally, I think that Frank Miller's Batman graphic novels are much more compelling.  Also, the Superman: Birthright is also a better graphic novel in my opinion.  I dunno, I guess you just have to read it and see for yourself.
1419705849|3.0|The book was okay. I am a fan of the series, and this wasn't my favorite. One thing that I really don't like is the varied plot. It starts out as a flashback in Greg's early years. Then all of a sudden it comes back to the present about the school dance. The plot then turns to Greg finding someone to take. And a chunk of the book is about Greg finding someone. Does he? It's up to you to read the book, but let me warn you it lacks that Diary of A Wimpy kid humor feel. It still has some entertaining jokes, but not nearly as many as the others. It could appeal more to some people than the others.
B008846SVA|3.0|A lovely story with fun illustrations, that appeal to all ages, reminding us that we really are all the same underneath.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Why isn't she bigger then she is now? She is very unique ALL her songs on this album are good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its accurate and handy. Ive been using it now for almost 2 months and never had an issue with it.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Anyone else getting irritated by the \\"I wish it was 1976\\" comments on here?  I think the songs are well written and sound great.  I've listened to it twice through, and I can't find a \\"terrible\\" track on here!  I'm love the late 80's/early 90's Aerosmith, but I think this is a decent album. The song with Carrie Underwood is going to be huge with the country crowd.  A lot of bands are teaming up with country stars to break in with that market.  She sounds great with Tyler.  Hell, she's 1/3 his age!  I'd be honored to have a babe of her caliber singing my songs at 60!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything about this trilogy was beyond wonderful!  I am going to read it again!!  I know this was created for the young adults, but I am 31 and I loved it so much!!!
B004TACMZ8|3.0|It works OK but the user interface is terrible. Too many<br />things to watch and NOT intuitive.<br /><br />The new Franklin stud finder is better buy that one instead.<br />I have both
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Love the series, can't wait for the third book.<br />A fun read and thought provoking. After finishing the book you will sit there and start to try to figure out the mysteries
B00A131VJA|1.0|I am extreamlly disapointed. all the songs sound the same. Voice is altered and is not genuine. Sounds like she was scraping the bottom of her barrel to put shit together and call it an album.
B007THA4FI|5.0|On finishing this book, I went right back to the beginning and reread it!  Beautifully drawn characters.  J.K. has a bit of a jaundiced eye but can she tell a great story.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. One of the very few games that I've actually spent a small amount of money on... and for me that is saying a lot.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|For those of you who, like me, grew up on - and liked - Kurt Vonnegut and Tim Robbins this book will bring you back there.  Its tone is light, comic, playful and the book has wonderful energy.  The Brits would call it cheeky.  Like most books today it's a bit too long.  (The demise of the literary editor is a sad thing.)  But if you like light-hearted mysteries with some romance and much current technology then you might like this book.  Try it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book kept me in suspence from beginning to end I Loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B004H2ZFPW|5.0|A damn good surprise ! Avril Lavigne signs one of her most personnal and sensitive album. It's like she's reading you her diary.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|The game is tedious and repetative.  There is very little challenge in that you find the hidden objects in the same screen over and over.  The mini games are simple; a puzzle that you simply spin the pieces around, a match game that you find the pairs, and a fix the vase, the mirror etc., they are all too simple.  I didn't grade it lower as it meets the criteria for hidden object; however if you are looking for a more interactive and thought inspiring game this is not it.  The is monotonous just like the first one.  --- Lizzie Z
0670020745|4.0|A great book with a personal insight, and can help experts and lain men to deal with such a problem, or even similar problems.<br />Human beings are re-adaptable, and going through that journey with the author, \\"watching\\" her improvement every step of the way is amazing. In addition, it's very exciting to learn new stuff about how our brain works scientifically and experimentally.
B009VB97EY|5.0|My life is now complete. Channing Tatum deserves an Oscar for the best body in a movie! I only wish he was naked more...
B009A9EQL6|1.0|I'm a huge fan of every era of Aerosmith, from  the days of Get Your Wings right up to the underrated Nine Lives and Just Push Play. However, the boys have really dropped the ball with this album. There's way too much bland filler, and even the better tracks aren't that good.<br /><br />Luv XXX, Love Alot and We All Fall Down are the best tracks, but even they would be amongst the weakest on any other Aerosmith album.<br /><br />The Carrie Underwood duet is awful... What Could Have Been Love is more of the same AOR ballad bullshit... Closer and Something are blatant filler... Oh Yeah is just another shameless Stones ripoff...  Out Go The Lights is a case of them being so happy they came up with a half decent riff that they decided to repeat it for seven and half tedious minutes.<br /><br />Music From Another Dimension is the sound of a band not even trying.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The movie has no real story line. My girlfriend who is a Matthew McConaughey freak, was even dissapointed in the movie. It was a waste of time and money to watch.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Excellent !!! A pretty good debut album. I hope many more will follow. It just hasn't enough exclusive titles !
B008458O3S|5.0|I really like this game. I play a few rounds then go get stuff done. It starts out slow then gets harder. I love the color mixing, simple graphics and the relaxed feeling. I am almost done and will look forward to Trainyard 2.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Our granddaughter loves 'white' noise.  The product has allowed us to babysit and have her sleep.  Personally, I don't understand it, but if she likes it, we like it!

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I loved this movie. It has awesome visual effects. The story line was so amazing that I was sucked right into the movie. I loved all the characters,but the only thing I didn't like about it was that Hulk wasn't in it that much. Other than that I loved it. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is one of my all time favorite authors.  I am a fan of all his books no matter what genre.  This book did not disappoint

0307383415|5.0|As the son of a Kenyan father and a white American mother, Barack Obama takes us through an emotional journey of racial contradictions, migration and social struggles. Dreams From My Father, written more than a decade ago is a revealing account of the questions that Obama struggled with as a young boy, as a student of law and throughout his career as a community organizer.<br /><br />The book is a chronological anecdote of an individual seeking to re-discover his identity as he moves from his maternal birthplace in Kansas to Hawaii to Indonesia where he grew up and finally to Kenya where he reconnects with his inevitable blood relatives.<br /><br />Even though the narrative here is emotional, I was amazed that it was not overly sentimental about his childhood life and his struggle with belonging and identity. By approaching these issues from an objective point of view, Obama allows you to better understand his journey from childhood to his role as a community leader.  I am also impressed by the objectivity he brings forth in his views and analyses of complex issues of race at a time when the American society was marred by outright racism. Great read!

B00A131VJA|5.0|Christina Aguilera has always been noticed for that voice that no one can sound like. I think this is her best album since Stripped. She is definitely trying to rise above all the pain like a Lotus. Do I think she will get the credit she deserves for this album? Probably not. But, this album is a statement that she is still in the game. My favorite tracks are #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #10 and #12. There is not much filler on this well-produced come back of an album. But the thing is she never went anywhere.... The Burlesque Soundtrack was awesome. Her vocals were amazing. They still are. One of the best singers in the world shows how it should be done once again.
0446580848|2.0|I've read most of Nelson DeMille's work:  Up Country, The Cathedral, The General's Daughter, The Charm School, and all of the John Corey novels.  I was disappointed in The Gatehouse and looked forward to The Panther.  This novel is high on John Corey wit but very low on action and suspense. Quite frankly it is boring compared to his previous work.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Being a major Star Wars fan, it was nearly instinct to purchase this app.  Angry Birds is a fun game on its own, but Angry Birds Star Wars is a unique and fun game experience with cartoon irony &amp; characters (or at least their bird counterparts) we are all familiar with from the epic origonal Star Wars trilogy.  I hope to see some updates with the familiar planets from the prequel trilogy.  Overall, an amazing app that is worth the money. :-)
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|In this album, Susan Boyle fulfills the promise of her amazing audition.  In her audition, we heard the raw and powerful voice, in this album, that voice has been honed to perfection.  There is no fluff, no \\"throw-aways\\" here.  Every song in this album is exquisitely performed.  She is Nancy declaring her poignant love in \\"Oliver\\" as she sings the moving \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\", Nettie inspiring and encouraging with \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" in \\"Carousel\\"; Desiree despairing over a wasted love as she asks \\"where are the clowns\\" from \\"A Little Night Music\\".  \\"Music of the Night\\", her duet with Michael Crawford is a stunning musical seduction.  She is a tattered and worn out Grizabella singing \\"Memory\\" in \\"Cats\\".  She portrays perfectly the grit and determination of the character in \\"Fame, the Musical\\" as she declares she is \\"Out Here On My Own\\"; Abba's \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is filled with pain and resignation; \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", the leading track perfectly provides the promise of what is to come and is sung as a moving nod to Eva Cassidy's arrangement, but, my opinion, with a lushness not heard in Ms Cassidy's rendition. \\"All I Want\\" and \\"This is the Moment\\", both duets with Donny Osmond are highlights of the album with a perfect musical chemistry between the two.  Finally, there is \\"Bring Him Home\\" from \\"Les Miserables\\".  She begins this song with nothing but her pure and crystal clear voice, and makes it a moving prayer that touches your very soul.<br />The orchestration is the perfect accompaniment and one can literally see Miss Boyle center stage performing to perfection these musical theater classics.<br />I believe that this album is a must have for any music lover, and will become a classic, providing musical joy and enjoyment for years to come.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|I ordered this and the E7 to compare the two.  E6 improves sound slightly and it gets just slightly better if connected with the LOD for iPhones/iPods. To keep it short, the price does not justify the slight increase in sound quality.<br /><br />I tested the E7 without the LOD and used the 3.5mm  male to male jack instead. The quality of sound is much better and more apparent. Cleaner and clearer sound at all levels (mids, highs, and lows). And this is without using the LOD connector.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|Having made her decision, this fourth and final book in the series follows Bella through her wedding, honeymoon and the events that lead to the inevitable standoff in the end with the Volturi. This book, in a departure of style from the others, is divided into three parts, the second of which is written from Jacob's point of view instead of Bella's. Happily Jacob's situation and unhappiness are resolved in the first half of the book, leaving the second half to deal almost entirely with the preparations for and the confrontation with the Volturi. Though a bit disturbed and annoyed by Bella's preoccupation with sex in this one, for the most part I enjoyed the characters a lot more because they were for once largely happy. It was neat to meet all the varied vampires who came to witness for the Cullens and the best part was definitely Bella saving the day in the end, despite her being portrayed as the weakest, most helpless character throughout the series.  Wonderful ending, and perhaps one day we might get further companion novellas, like Renesmee and Jacob's story, or the unfinished Midnight Sun could be resurrected! Engaging series!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really, this trilogy had to be mined for the actual sweet little story.  It is a\\" fabulous\\" (satire here on my part) made for TV movie plot...but the censors would have a real challenge with keys to the \\"Red Room equipment locker.\\" A yuppie fairy tale; rich, driven and screwed up man meets a life changing, well educated and perfect woman.  Together, they undergo many trials and various positions to reach their happy ending. It is not the product of a literary genius and forgetable.
B005BDZN62|5.0|The movie is, as we all know, fantastic. However, if the last time you saw this film was on broadcast tv in the 1970's, this blue ray disc will leave you wide eyed and slack-jawed. Mastered from the original 70mm film stock, the images are pristine, beautifully saturated, and tack sharp. Viewed  on a 110\\"  1080p screen, this uncut, perfectly restored motion picture is stunningly beautiful to watch. Get it. Immerse yourself.

B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is exactly what it seems. Great quality, super functional, compact and cute. The inside flap is textured so you can prop the screen at any angle while using the kindle. The only slightly weird thing is in order to plug in the charging cable, you have to leave the case wide open and almost prop the device up like a book, or lay flat. Other than that, works great. Good material, easy to wipe clean. Nice tight fit for the kindle in the holder and the elastic closure band is perfect. Definitely recommend this case.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I really like this continuing story and look forward to the final book BUT it wasn't as engaging as the first book.  Book two is about the next generation but I didn't feel as connected to the characters as I did with book one.  It's still a good read!
B0041KVW2K|4.0|This is simply a response to a couple of absurd responses already posted. 1) Of course this is the vinyl issue of the remastered catalog - there are so many variations of the original mixes that anything else would be uselessly redundant. You want the original mixes? Go buy MFSL, Japanese pressings, originals - the market is glutted with them. 2) $60 - $80 as a proper price for this set? Are you insane? These are 180 gram re-issues with all original packaging and an almost 300 page full color hardcover book. Standard 180 gram issues of ANY title are released at roughly around $25; this set has 16 discs - do the math. 3) Yes, the set is heavy, but while the outer box mine arrived in showed some distress, the box set itself was fine. 4) I agree with the reviewer about being cognizant of the equipment used to play vinyl. This set is a comparatively limited issue (10,000 - 15,000 internationally) for a reason - the audiophile vinyl audience is small and quietly growing, but is a small fraction of the music customer base as a whole.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The research that Ken Follett did for this book is very obvious. He includes details in his story that contribute greatly to the excitement while following his characters through the actions occuring during this monumental time. His descriptions of the trench warfare give the reader a lot to think about. I look forward to continuing on to the next book in the series.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was pretty much what I expected.  The plot to these books is becoming predictable.  The ending was the only thing that was a little surprising.  It does make you want to get the next one ASAP but we have to wait another year!
1476715904|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  It was so much more than the brief synopsis gives it credit for.  I enjoyed the characters, their realistic dialogue and issues, and the fact that nothing about this book was predictable or generic.  The overall story really moved me emotionally.  I laughed, I cried, I wanted to scream, and best of all, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I grew to love all of the characters and their relationships and really felt for them throughout the entire story.  I also enjoyed the use of poetry, lyrics, and obscure phrases (i.e., carving pumpkins) that came to tell so much.  I think one thing that surprised me the most was how many great life lessons were in here and pieces of advice that I think we can all use.<br /><br />In summary, Slammed is a great story about love, loss, and life in general.  It's stuck in my head and I think I'll take this one with me for quite some time.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|The Verso Sharyn Sowell Cities cover for Kindle Fire is both sturdy and beautiful. The cover is a rich brick red which is covered in names of cities from around the world done in beautiful calligraphy. It reminds me of an old journal. The inside of the cover is a black microfiber which is smooth. The inside boasts an inside pocket which can be handy for paper or a note card. The e-reader or tablet is held in place by four elastic straps which are lined with silicone to give them added strength. The straps feel sturdy and tight. The cover is hinged so it stays open while you read.<br /><br />While this cover states it was made for Kindle it not only will fit your Kindle Fire and Kindle keyboard, it will fit most 7 inch e-readers or tablets.<br /><br />Verso covers are functional yet stylish! I own several and love them all! The cover gives your Kindle Fire personality while it keeps your Kindle Fire well protected.

B00942XS04|1.0|We ordered this for our almost 3 year old and were shocked and horrified at how violent the movie was.  This movie is like a James Bond movie, has a tough plot to follow and there torture scenes that ended in the killing of cars.  There were machine guns and car killing and car death and cars saying \\"I want him dead,\\" and \\"Kill him.\\"  Just terrible.  This movie is nothing like the first Cars movie, which was funny and light.<br /><br />I can't for the life of me understand why they would have this rated G.  I called Amazon and got my money back.<br /><br />I can't give it enough negative stars.<br /><br />If it were rated PG or stated that it was not for the same age set as the original Cars movie, then I would give it more stars.  But to rate this movie G is unforgivable.  Disgusting!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|This album has some great rockers and some real duds! What this album really needed was a good A&R man to edit out, or at least down, the ballads.

B0088X7YMS|2.0|If you loved the original film STARSHIP TROOPERS then good for you. I too loved the movie and found it to be one of the most original science fiction films released in some time. The sequel was okay but then it became more of a franchise and less of a story. A series of CGI cartoons followed on TV and that ended up becoming feature length CGI cartoons like this one, STARSHIP TROOPERS-INVASION.<br /><br />A group of troopers are sent aboard a stranded space vessel to recover a squad sent in to rescue a prisoner and his guard. They don't know why, they just follow orders. Both are retrieved and a swarm of \\"bugs\\" attack them, taking out a few members and wounding another. They make it back to their ship but something is wrong.<br /><br />One of two ships involved here goes dark and the troopers are sent in to find out what's happening. To their dismay they find more \\"bugs\\" and a problem bigger than they expected to find.<br /><br />Okay so that's a small description of what this film is all about but in truth it doesn't take much more than that to explain. What we have here isn't so much about story or furthering the mythology behind the series. Instead we have tons of explosions and gun battles involving humans versus \\"bugs\\". Honestly that gets pretty boring after a while, even more so when even the humans are CGI.<br /><br />Just to make sure the film gets an R rating (as if the violence weren't enough) a couple of nude shots are inserted as well. If naked CGI women are your thing then by all means, pick this movie up. You'll want to freeze frame on those scenes where most of us sit and wonder why anyone would find the need to make them in the first place.<br /><br />It's a shame that movies like this get made while other more deserving films sit in limbo waiting to be made. My guess would be that it costs little to make, that most of the programming for the CGI was in the computers already and they thought they could get a nice return on investment by making this. Fans of the original will find no reason to seek this out. Fans of science fiction will not find much to like either. That leaves pretty much no one who will love this movie with the exception of naked CGI babe fetish crowd.ans of the original will find no reason to seek this out.

141659521X|5.0|Joe Rickman has been working in the field for the CIA for many years.  He is a brilliant strategist, and superb mover of men and resources in order to accomplish those goals important to his employers.  It would be unthinkable that terrorist interests could capture Joe and torture him for the information about those CIA assets around the world that he holds in his head.  The unthinkable happens when he is captured and all four of his body guards are killed.  The CIA has only one man to call on to find and retrieve Joe, and that is Mitch Rapp.  Vince Flynn has featured Mitch in many books over the years and created an individual to whom the end does justify the means.  If he feels he needs to in order to achieve his goals he thinks nothing of killing an enemy of the U.S. in cold blood and never mind the opinions of the bleeding hearts that preach kindness and understanding for those whose only interests are harming America.<br />  Mitch is dispatched to Afghanistan where Rickman was snatched from a safe house and his bodyguards killed.  He immediately has a run in with an Afghan official who indicates that he will manage the investigation into Rickman's disappearance.  Rapp quickly puts the man in his place by threatening to kill him if he does not cooperate with the CIA in ascertaining the truth about Joe Rickman's disappearance.  In addition to obstacles placed in Mitch's way by Afghan authorities, the FBI comes upon the scene and indicates that it has proof that Mitch and Joe Rickman colluded in siphoning off money from CIA funds for their own personal use.<br />  And to add to Mitch's troubles an assassin presented in a previous book makes an appearance charged with getting rid of Rapp.  Louie Gould in a previous setting had murdered Mitch's pregnant wife.  For some reason he was not killed by Rapp when catching up to him and reenters the scene.  Stage is set, characters and plot intermixed and Vince Flynn's trademark rapid pace and constant action unfold to thedelight of the reader.  Like previous Mitch Rapp books there is no putting it down, and readers are caught up in the plot, counterplot of the story from the very beginning until the last page.
1439102732|3.0|I typically love Jodi Picoult. Her topics are so well researched, and really make you think, and consider all sides of a subject. However, this is the first book (and most recent) that I feel like has become far-fetched, predictable, and mass produced. Midway through I struggled to even want to finish it...
B0067EKY7M|4.0|When I first heard the title of this film I was curious. After learning what the plot was I thought it was ridiculous. After watching the movie I found it was a wonderful film that I knew I could go back and watch again and still be entertained.<br /><br />The premise of the film is that a sheik in Yemen loves fly fishing. He finds it a relaxing way to spend time and dreams of having his own fishing stream in Yemen. The only problem is that there are no salmon in Yemen. It's also not just the fishing that he wants to bring to his country. The sheik is a visionary, wanting to have peace in his country and hoping to change it for the better. To do so he will spare no expense to make it happen.<br /><br />The sheik contacts his investment consultant in London, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) and tells her to get things started. For Harriet and the group she works for nothing is impossible when it comes to the sheik. She contacts the British government and the PR person in charge thinks it will give them some good press in the hopes of building relations between the two countries.  She doesn't think it will work but that doesn't matter as long as it looks good.<br /><br />The program is passed down the line until it arrives at the desk of Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), a bureaucrat who's comfortable in his cubicle doing little and being paid for it. A devout fly fisherman himself, he thinks there is no way possible this could work and tells Harriet so. Her reply is for him to find a way to make it work. Apparently working together will be nothing but a cause of friction between these two.<br /><br />Jones gets things running with the hope that the obstacles he finds will prevent the project from moving forward. Instead the doors are opened for each one to be eliminated due to the involvement of the government. Eventually he finds himself meeting with the sheik himself to discuss the project. What he finds, the man he meets and talks with, changes his attitude toward not just the project but his life as well.<br /><br />Against all odds the project does move forward. Salmon are found and a way to relocate them is made. The river that they intend to bring the salmon to is made and will not only be a place for the fish but will change the world of Yemen as well. Unfortunately not everyone in that country agrees with the sheik and problems are set in motion at the same time the project moves forward.<br /><br />The nicest thing about this film is that it isn't just about the building of a river to be stocked with fish not natural to the location. It's about life and people and the effects they have on one another. The images of the salmon swimming upstream make for a wonderful metaphor to life lived in pursuit of a dream, constantly battling the flow of the river in the hopes of reaching a goal.<br /><br />The story also revolves around not just the project but the characters played by Blunt and McGregor. While Blunt is engaged to an MIA soldier and McGregor is married, both are not in relationships they necessarily want. Blunts was short lived, having met the man she fell in love with shortly before he disappeared. McGregor is married to a woman more concerned with her status in life, her career and moving upward in social status than she is in him and his dreams. The pair come together to see the project become a reality and in so doing find one another as well. How that will play out between the return of the missing soldier and McGregor's marriage is resolved before the film ends.<br /><br />The movie is visually attractive, making the area that is supposed to be Yemen attractive in its own way. The possibilities of making this area not just productive but attractive to tourists and the like becomes believable. It would be wonderful for something like this, something that would make this area of the world a beautiful place to be would happen. But as the story progresses the chances of that happening are less than hopeful due to the politics of the land.<br /><br />The romance between the two leads is well played and more tender than one would expect. In a world where most movies find the main characters ready to forget their world and responsibilities and ready to jump into bed at the drop of a hat, these characters slowly find one another. The sexual chemistry between them is one that builds and simmers but never becomes physical. The resolution to their predicament isn't resolved until the end of the film.<br /><br />As I said at the start here, trying to judge a film by title alone doesn't always turn out with the expected results. Don't let the title of this one make you walk by it on the shelf. Instead pick it up and watch it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.e to the politics of the land.<br /><br />The romance between the two leads is well played and more tender than one would expect.

B009H2PCNC|5.0|When the mood is right, there are few greater pleasures for me than traveling along with Brian Eno and submerging into one of his sparklingly beautiful ambient mindscapes.  His newest, Lux, was designed to accompany an art installation in Turin, Italy, themed around \\"the play of light.\\"  The album is a series of four long pieces totaling about 1.2 hours.  The structure is alternating and overlapping synth tones which seem to shimmer and hang in the air like the play of light that inspired the music.  The music sounds fairly harmonious on its surface, but there is subtle tension lurking below, slightly more noticeable within \\"LUX 2\\" & \\"3.\\"  This would seem to be perfect music for experiencing an art installation, but it's also excellent as background music for working on the computer, reading a magazine, drinking a glass of wine, etc.  Maybe for meditation, too, although I wonder if the subtle shifts in feeling might prove too distracting for that purpose.

1400069289|4.0|Charles does a wonderful job incorporating the many facts, stories and experiences as learning opportunities within the book. Discovering the habit loop and how it operates within your life is a very powerful thing. I've used the cue-routine-reward loop to track several urges that often lead to behaviors I later regret (i.e. eating another cookie at lunch, sitting on the couch after work rather than going to the gym, hitting the snooze button, opening my web browser instead of finishing that report that's due at the end of the week)and found that it is possible to change. This can be an empowering tool for anyone. It is a fascinating well-written book. Thanks Charles. I highly recommend this book.
B00A0HQ7H8|2.0|BORN TO DIE is likely going to turn out to be my favorite female album of 2012, I listened to it nigh daily the months after it came out, and after that at least once a week- but this follow up sounds quite horrendous - too slow and brooding, no pep or excitement - one of these tracks is a re-releae (YAYO) and there is the BLUE VELVET cover, which only leaves seven original songs that are really seven variations on the same slow descent into mediocrity... the result is an \\"album\\" that mostly sounds like B-sides...<br /><br />Lana, you are definitely talented, but I think it's too soon for this ... please take a year off and find a new direction, or you are destined for one-hit wonder status, sweetie!<br /><br />By the way, my review title references the fact that almost EVERY track on BORN TO DIE featured this phrase, or some variation of a reference to her dress - to the point I turned it into a drinking game - PARADISE, from the cuts I've heard, appears to follow in the same path ... why is LDR so obsessed with dresses!?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have been very interested in near death experiences for the last 30 years, but was always somewhat skeptical wondering if other authors who have written about NDEs were just jumping on a band wagon to try to sell a book.  Since this book was written by a man of science who happens to be a neurosurgeon, I thought he had a lot of credibility.  He explains what medically happened to him and why he believes that there was not a scientific or organic cause for his experience.  I can highly recommend this book.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Deftones Koi No Yokan is a melodic masterpiece. From the opening track Swerve City you can feel that this will be a dynamic record. Chino's voice is as usual the highlight of this record. But the dynamics between each song reminds me of when I was a kid listening to White Pony. No two songs sound the same. Each one stands alone. Deftones are by far leaps and bounds ahead of any band. Except for maybe Tool. The standout song for me on this record is definitely Leathers. Mainly because I love heavy heavy riffs. I also love Poltergeist. Anyways The Deftones never fail to amaze me. They are the only band I look forward to seeing and hearing. If you are a fan of Deftones you will love this record. If you are a fan of well composed music give it a listen. You will not be disappointed.

Following the catastrophic events of the previous year, the boys are back to battle their season long villians...  LEVIATHAN's.<br /><br />Most series seem to lose steam as they get older, SUPERNATURAL picks up steam.  It has lost none of it's appeal.  The stories are still innovative and imaginative.  The direction is always first class.  The tech credits a superb.  But, the big attraction to the series is the fantastic chemistry of the Winchester brothers, Sam and Dean.  As played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, they are terrific together.  They make the viewer believe they really are brothers.  Add to this a series of recurring characters played by Jim Beaver, Mark Sheppard and Julian Richings.<br /><br />The season starts off with a bang...  and ends in spectacular fashion, beautifully setting up what is showing on television now.<br /><br />Treat yourself and watch the show (from the beginning)...  It is great!

I am not a fan of network montages to begin with (they're just tacky and overly-obvious and as a consumer I don't get much out of them) but usually you can skip past them and get to the menu of the show you're watching, no biggie.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />For some reason, Showtime and/or the DVD manufacturers decided to bake the Showtime promo into their menu in such a way that there is no way to skip it -- you can't fast-forward, you can't skip to \\"next\\", you can't go to Menu, and you can't even hit \\"stop\\" and then start again to get to the Menu functions.  That sucks.  As a consumer THE VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY LAST THING I WANT IS NO CONTROL OVER MY VIEWING EXPERIENCE.<br /><br />I had planned to give this a DVD a decent review, the four or five stars it deserved on content alone. But then I saw that other customers had blasted it for the DVD menu, and since the real reason I wanted to review this disc was because I wanted to complain about the forced montage viewing, I realized that an \\"unfair\\" one-star review was more appropriate: this is a protest vote. If DVD sales are impacted by these low, negative reviews, and if that's what it takes to get Showtime's attention, so be it.<br /><br />Dear Showtime: if you have a good product -- a well-written, well-produced, well-acted show -- then people will buy it. But if you treat customers like babies and force them to watch lame promotional videos that NO ONE WANTS TO SEE, then you will alienate your fans. I am a fan. I like DVDs, not downloads. But if in the future every Showtime series has a forced-viewing feature like this, you will lose my business. Just saying. (Axton)
B005Z28M58|5.0|Why is a guy such a fan of Desperate Housewives?  Because it is just fun entertainment.  The series has a fantastic cast of not only regular characters, but also recurring and guest stars.<br /><br />The eighth and final season of this series includes a couple of deaths...  a birth...  more intrigue for the citizens of Wisteria Lane.  The storyline line that finished last season continues on in this one.  We know what happens...  but, the twists and turns of what our girls and their families go through makes for some terrific and very amusing television.<br /><br />Though I will not reveal what happens, or to whom...  there is a major death that sends ripples through everyone.  It is kind of set up earlier, but, when it happens, it is brutal and shocking.<br /><br />By the time the series ends...  different paths are taken...  we know our core group will go onto greater things.  The final moments are haunting.  Those lives that have been lost make their last ghostly appearance.  Needless to say, very emotional.<br />Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) is seen last.  A grand end to a very great show.  It's been a wonderful ride.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|A cracking good Agatha Christie murder mystery with no detective (until the very end). Written in 1939 and set in that time, it omits the modern crime-solving techniques and even things like cell phones. It doesn't take long for the reader to be swept up in the situation at hand, however, and to try to guess the identity of the murderer, until he or she is murdered. The end seems a bit contrived, but plausible. A good book for a discussion group.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show. I started watching it on Netflix. I quickly caught up to the newer episodes that are only available on Amazon.<br />That being said, I have to \\"Stream for uninterrupted\\" and Continue to hit  \\"keep trying\\" every 5 minutes. And no im not exaggerating. My PS3 controller turns off after 10 of being idle.<br />If I wasn't addicted to this show I wouldn't go through Amazon.<br /> Give half of the (estimated) $20.00 back to me and I will leave a more enjoyable review.<br />Streaming? You call dial up connection speeds streaming? Fools.<br />More like an agonizing dribble of data from a rusted waterline.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very good but very sad. Written beautifully. Each character had so much depth and were unique from any other characters I have read about.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the sexual erotica that his book had to offer, and with an underlying plot nonetheless! The storyline captured me as much as the heated sex and excitement...the only thing that bugged me was the dramatic actions of the female. She seemed like such a piece of work, it was a bit exhausting at times. But all I'm all...it's a fun, spicy read!
B007HU7NBK|3.0|I think this book clears up some of the holes in DD's story, so far.A love letter to fans. I just wish he'd have dug deeper, into who he is.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This was a very good movie - cried several times, however, have watched it several times.  Makes me want to think twice about going into the ocean!
B000I186FW|5.0|A really, really good film! I wish that it hadn't taken me this long to see it! It has a unique plot and is superbly acted. I highly recommend it!!
B004GYY714|5.0|One of the best apps I have on my Kindle and Android phone.  I use one or the other if I want to listen to radio programs.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I LOVE this game. Its very entertaining, I love being able to mix species, and the fact that you can visit other peoples islands and see all sorts of dragon kinds.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I decided to purchase this product based on the reviews.  Everything that was mentioned was true.  I can not believe how friendly and easy to use this product.  I recommended this item to several of my friends already.<br /><br />This is a tiny little wonder and very cheap considering what it can do and all the options to go with it without removing the film or the slide once you inserted it (i.e., flip the image, mirror the image, and many adjustments you can make before you scan and save the image).  Thank you.<br /><br />BEST of ALL...was getting a replacement when something went wrong with my equipment.  I notified the company at once.  I received a friendly response the very next day.  The customer service communicated with me through the whole processes via email until I received  the replacement and they made sure that I am satisfied with the new item.<br /><br />Hooray for the excellent and professional customer service and support.  I am extremely satisfied with this product and the overall customer service.  Thanks again
B0047SF41G|4.0|After reading the IMDB reviews on this movie I thought it was going to seriously suck, but I actually really enjoyed it. It might mostly be due to the fact that I'm a fan of Topher Grace, I love action/thriller movies in general, and I'm not a die hard fan of the original Predator movies, but regardless, I liked this movie. I recommend it if you're not so nostalgic that you can't get past that it's not the original.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Folletts trilogy book 11 is a must read. Very well written. Can't put it down. I loved the first book as well and can hardly wait for the third book.
0385536828|3.0|\\"I was the basest of readers. All I wanted was my own world, and myself in it, given back to me in artful shapes and accessible form.\\"<br /><br />Sweet Tooth tells the story of Serena, a woman living in early 1970's England. She is an avid reader of modern literature and is eventually recruited to MI5, the United Kingdom's security agency, after receiving an interview via her middle-aged lover. Her task is to recruit a writer, Tom Haley, who has been pegged as unsympathetic to communism in order for him to write articles with the intent to change the people's perception. Except he can't know that he's doing this for the sole benefit of the government. When Serena realizes that falling in love with Tom means she needs to decide whether or not to continue lying to him or risk everything and tell him all.<br /><br />Ian McEwan managed to portray an extremely convincing story from a female's point-of-view. Admittedly, Serena was not a terribly easy character to like but I'm thinking that was quite possibly the intention. Sweet Tooth certainly had an extremely authentic atmosphere, his portrayal of 1970's England was brilliantly detailed and exact. The 1970's was of course quite different especially regarding the attitude towards women in the workplace.<br /><br />Yes, this is a spy novel and several scenes reminded me of a John le Carr&eacute; novel, but the whole espionage bit was really put on the back burner in regards to the rest of the story. The story really focuses on Serena's personal development, her maturity, and finding love. The writing was brilliant at times, and most other times was dreadfully dull. It was really hard to be invested in the story as a whole; emotions were described but were hard to get a true grasp on them in order to really understand and appreciate the story. Enjoyable read, but certainly wasn't as anticipated and lacked in overall impressiveness.
0385344333|5.0|LOVED THE BOOK AND THE SERVICE. I'VE READ THEM ALL, WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE.<br />TOM CRUISE? I DON'T THINK SO.
B009H442DG|4.0|John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John are back after a 35 year hiatus (their smash GREASE duet hit \\"You're The One That I Want\\" is the greatest pop duet of all time) with a new CD release. The CD (13 tracks) sees the duo at it again with X-mas songs and is titled 'This Christmas' : covers of well known X-mas songs (12 of them) plus a brand new original track \\"I Think You Might Like It\\", composed by John Farrar as a sequel of their smash hit. It's a great up-tempo pop track, how far it'll go time will tell. It's one of my favourite track from this entertaining CD : Olivia Newton-John's voice is great as ever and John Travolta's at much lower tone as compared to in GREASE but enjoyable nevertherless. Most of the songs are orchestral based with the duo singing quite well plus an array of big name guest artists including Barbara Streisand, Tony Bennett, James Taylor, Kenny G, Cliff Richard & Chick Corea.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree\\", a rocky track with a beautiful melody & duo vocals featuring Kenny G on horns; \\"Silent Night\\", a slow-tempo track with a wonderful violin sound, vocals & melody; \\"Have Yourself A Merry Christmas\\", orchestral track featuring Cliff Richard & \\"I Think You Might Like It\\", I certainly do like it. Good tracks include \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\", orchestral jazzy track featuring Barbara Streisand; \\"This Christmas\\", another orchestral jazz track featuring Chick Corea; \\"The Christmas Waltz\\", another orchestral jazz track; \\"Winter Wonderland\\", a cabaret styled song featuring Tony Bennett and the Count Basie Orchestra; \\"White Christmas\\", a orchestral jazz track; \\"The Christmas Song\\", orchestral jazz track & \\" Auld Lang Syne/Christmas Time Is Here (Medley)\\". Okay tracks are the opening track \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" & \\"Deck The Halls\\", a pop-ish track featuring James Taylor.<br /><br />The proceeds of this CD will go to charities : Jett Travolta Foundation (children with autism & epilepsy), Cancer Foundation & Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. So this is quite personal for the duo (John Travolta losing his 16 year old autistic son who had epileptic seizures & Olivia Newton-John battling breast cancer a few years ago).<br /><br />Christmas is around the corner, a host of X-mas albums are out now (more on the way), the duo of John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John have re-united to hopefully warm you up this X-mas with this entertaining CD 'This Christmas', a recommended CD listening.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Continues the tradition of epic animated batman films.  Bruce Wayne is old but still a force not to be trifled with.
B004742Y68|4.0|What's to say that has not been said before... It's a Steven Spielberg film, it's super good, scary and takes you on an emotional ride all at the same time.  Can watch this film over and over and still be thrilled.
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun times! if you love dragons and easy levelling that is :) don't worry too much about getting the best dragons though!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I came into this movie knowing nothing about the plot.  My only expectation was that I would see an interesting space/action movie.  Usually I am willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief in exchange for good action, but I found that hard to do in this film.  I thought the story and action were unusually weak.  Trying to avoid spoilers here so I'll just say that a lot of things happen to a woman and she perseveres unbelievably.  That was just over the top for me.  It was more like a parody of Sigourney Weaver's performance in Alien than anything else.  I found it reminiscent of the Monty Python skit with King Arthur and the Black Knight, where the Black Knight keeps on fighting while ignoring the fact that all his limbs are cut off.  I guess I still found it entertaining and worth the rental fee, but just barely.  If I had paid to see it in a theater I would have been very disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|same as the  first, it didnt grab me as I expected, was however rated among my peers they cant stop talking about the books.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Consider this the origin of the Ridley Scott Alien films. Special effects were great as were the actors.  A definite watch for sci fi lovers.
0802473156|5.0|After this book was recommended to us, we ordered it the very next day.  It is a very easy read and full of helpful tips that bring to light many subjects that sometimes go unnoticed.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|What an enjoyable album. There is a nice mix of songs that will play well in the background while trimming the tree and putting up decorations.<br /><br />Each voice is showcased in typical Pentatonix fashion. It is amazing the many different styles they can produce. If you are familiar with their work, this album will not disappoint.<br /><br />Although most songs are a nice mellow, rich sound, my favorite is the faster up-beat Carol of the Bells. The only thing that would make this a better album would be more songs added.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|it took too long to get to get to the point of the relationship that these people were trying to have
B009KHBDUU|4.0|This film captured the essence of the original series and Johnny Depp as always delivers a great performance.  He is a true to form actor.
B0086213XW|3.0|It was an OK flick but the ending was a little different then what I thought.  She seemed a bit off center in her thinking at times.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have not compelted this book yet but what I have read so far has completely caught my attention.  I have to admit I already am a Stephen King fan - however this book is well worth the read.  I am sure the remaining chapters will be just as entertaining as those that I have already completed.
B0054JELTI|5.0|the item arrived on time when promised, not defective, kids love it ..... there were no problems with this order at all.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found  the book to be very insightful and inspiring.  It was nice to hear that a \\"non-beiever\\" so to speak found God and now believes.  I highly recommend this book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed it as usual: a classic page-turner that you have a hard time putting down with enough details and 'color' to make it interesting and not feeling like a road well-traveled.  BUT.  Yes, a big but...  I had this one figured out way too soon to my taste.  In fact, I was surprised as to how soon.  BUT (yes, another one) even though the plot wasn't a surprise anymore, I still loved how it got to its conclusion.  I won't spoil it for folks who didn't read it yet, but I'd be amazed if I'm the only person who had this experience.  So John, please, next time don't make it that obvious.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Didn't think it held the 'excitement' that most of Cornwell's novels do. Didn't care for the ending this time. Kay Scarpetta is one of my favorite female mentors (ficton) but the book just didn't hold my rapt attention! But it certainly would not deter me from reading further adventures of Ms. Scarpetta. And of course Marino, Lucy and all the other characters that fill the pages and continue to solve crimes committed by really bizzare individuals!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a beautifully written story of a young woman who found herself on the trail. Every word, every sentence, every paragraph is well crafted-drawing you deeper and deeper into her story.  This is a book you will not want to put down!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This has everything I was hoping for in a Soundgarden album - soaring vocals, a wide variety of style, and lyrics that conjure up some really haunting imagery.<br /><br />Each member's talents are on full display here...and if you still spin Superunknown or Down on the Upside you won't have any trouble finding something you like on this record.
B00A12Z264|1.0|Shut Up and Your Body are edited! Why would I want to listen to a song that says \\"Shut up just shut the beep up\\" I wouldn't ... if you are going to slap an \\"explicit\\" tag on the album then it better not be edited garbage like this is! I was excited to buy this album but now I will save my money and not waste my time on censorship!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game has got so many dragons you can get and the all the quests there are its soooooo fun

B008Y1YJZY|1.0|Was really lookin forward to this 3d movie,sat back with the wifey abd started to watch it in 3d,bout an hour in we both looked at each other and said that we where done with this movie,wasnt funny and no real plot,only that santa is a fat waste that doesnt do anything and that arthur was way over goofy and annoying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an amazing story that makes you live it entirely and gives you a lot to think about. My favorite book of this year!

B007M45PMU|5.0|Really, really enjoy this album. Heard a cut on the radio, checked out the album, sounded good, purchased same.<br />Well worth the money.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Cleans the clutter in about twenty (20) seconds total.  A nice app to have to keep the memory clean.  Very easy to use, also.
B004G600A4|5.0|No complaints at all with transaction.  This is one of our favorite movies.  The story is modern with a very capable heroin and the music is beautiful.
B0027MJU00|5.0|While not as immediately gripping as Gone Girl, I find myself thinking about Dark Places much more and far longer.  As the author unravels the mystery, the reader becomes deeply involved with the characters, both as kids and adults.  I could have read the book in one sitting, but I put it away 2/3 through so I could think about it and conjure possible endings.  Like all of Flynn's books, I didn't want it to end.
0316228532|5.0|I absolutely devoured every word of this book. while this is deemed a tragicomedy, Ms Rowling kept it light enough (amidst very serious topics as drug addiction, cutting, suicide) to make this a true pageturner. Each character was so thoroughly devised you feel like you know them. Her ability to equally get into the mind of a teenage boy or an overweight pompous man, a woman in midlife experiencing restlessness or an addict are incredible. She creates characters you can hate, love, can cheer on, can laugh at or with.<br />I was shocked at the negative review in the NYT-I was spellbound by this novel and have spent every spare second over the past four days reading it-with three kids home for 4 days no easy feat. I was sad to finish it this morning because it was so entertaining. I am beyond thrilled to know there is another contemporary writer out there with this amount of talent.
B00956UPSW|5.0|Awesome,down still kicking ass, best new music i have heard this year, young kids aint got shit on this. Southern Metal Lives !
B007OV9EYG|2.0|Well, obviously advertising this film with and selling out to SUV's was a mistake. So what was the point of making it a 'seussical' when singer/songwriter Taylor Swift never sings? True, the original book did say 'No one can sing who has smog in his throat.' Yet we have a whole crowd song and Audrey (Swift) does not join in. Why? Is she trying to show that she can sing and act? If so, it would be nice if someone explained that.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Scholarly work with uplifting take-home message for those who fear death.  The author overcomes \\"arrogant surgeon stereotype\\" to confirm his inability to verbalize his experiences for those who have not experienced a near-death event similar to his. This reviewer must confess bias as a former student of author's much admired late father.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|May be the best of the TS series.  I loved it; so did my 9 YO son.  This movie runs the entire range of emotions.  There were times I was close to bawling...snif.  Excellent story line and great new characters.  It also seems we may be set up for TS 4?  Here's hoping the dynasty never ends.  Keep up the great work, Pixar.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is a perfect case for the Fire HD.  With the bright cover, I never lose it and I love the infinitely adjustable angle.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  I can't say enough about Claire Danes' performance.  I am a mother of an autistic child and this movie gave me so much insight into her world.  Wonderful movie - I will share this with friends and family.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We'll watch these DVD's over and over again and still laugh just as much as we did when first watching the episodes!
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie is just one of those feel good stories that just puts you in a happy place. It's funny, witty, sweet, deals with some drama in an almost every day sort of slice of life type of story. There is of course a happy ending and it's empowering to watch two women find happiness and live life the way they want to. This movie is a must watch.
B009DA74ES|5.0|I can't talk about this show enough. It's just genius. The dialog pacing is flawless and the humor timing is spot on.<br />Seriously, David Duchovny is Perfection! David Duchovny's delivery has the timing of a master comic actor and his portrayal of Hank is winning.<br /><br />This show  has it all. It has made me laugh, cringe, smile, cry, and yes, best of all, kept me thinking about each episode long after the credits have rolled.<br />This is a David Duchovny showcase and he is iconic but Natacha (Karen), Madeleine Martin (Becca), Pamela Adlon (Marcy) and Evan Handler (Charlie Runkle) are AWESOME too. And I´m in love with Stu too.:) Season Five is my favorite because this show is getting better and better each season. I loved RZA (Samurai Apocalypse) and Megan Good. I´ve never laughed so hard.<br /><br />The soundtrack is epic.<br /><br />Lots  of gratuitous sex and drugs and rock and roll and hilarious situations. LOL

0545403359|4.0|Joey is a young colt who was purchased for three guineas by an English farmer.  The farmer's son Albert is thirteen at the time and begins to care for Joey.  But when World War I begins a couple of years later, Albert's father sells Joey to Captain Nicholls of the British cavalry because he needs the money.  Albert, who is still too young to join the army, promises that someday he will find the horse.  Joey is ridden in a disastrous cavalry charge into German machine guns.  Captain Nicholls is killed, and the horse is captured as a prisoner of war.  The Germans use him first for hospital cart transport and then for artillery cart pulling but allow him to be stabled on a French farm where he is taken care of by the farmer and his granddaughter Emelie.  Bolting after his friend Topthorn dies, Joey ends up in no-man's land between the German and English trenches and through a coin-toss is once again taken by the English but is very ill.  Meanwhile, Albert has joined the veterinary corps.  What will happen to Joey?  And will Albert and Joey ever see each other again?<br /><br />  There is not as much good historical fiction for young people from the World War I era as from other well-known war periods.  Readers can get unique and perceptive views of World War I as soldiers from both sides of the conflict share their thoughts and feelings with Joey.  The age range is listed for eight and up, but I would recommend it more for twelve and up.  Some of the battle scenes, while not overly graphic, are rather blunt and might not be appropriate for younger children, especially those who are sensitive.  Also, the \\"h\\" word is used a few times as a curse, and the name of God is found as an interjection on several occasions.  The novel is said to have an \\"anti-war\\" message, but I think older young people can still enjoy the story, which is based on a true story about a horse named Warrior, even if they don't necessarily share the attempted \\"neutral\\" stance of the author. Of course, everyone prefers peace, but many of us still believe that there were a right side and a wrong side in World War I.  And the way in which the passing of time is dealt with might be confusing to some.  The book was originally published in 1982 but didn't become well known until made into an award winning play in 2007 and an acclaimed film in 2011.everyone prefers peace, but many of us still believe that there were a right side and a wrong side in World War I.

B009YX02T8|5.0|I think it is impossible to accurately review this album before seeing the movie. There was one of the albums in this saga that I hated... until I saw the movie and could hear where all the songs went and then it gave me a whole new perspective and I love it now. I will assume the same can be said about this soundtrack. Having said that I certainly do not hate this album... the songs are great.  They have that rainy/foggy feel that these movies need. Music makes a HUGE impact on movies and if I had to guess from this album the movie will be FANTASTIC!  Check out the other soundtracks if you haven't.  They are equally as great!
B008EQIK90|3.0|This product was very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very decent. And it wasn't anything else. Annoying review limit

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an amazing book. I finished it in three days because the whole idea is so intriguing. I gave it four stars because I would have enjoyed a bit more details in certain scenes. However, I loved the style of writing.
B0081EMM8K|4.0|Like the movie but the Notebook was way way better. Glad I saw it at home instead of the movie theater.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|I had like camp rock when it first came out. I never got to see the second one right away, but when I did i really enjoyed it. It has a great cast and good music.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Having always been a fan of the Scarpetta books, I was extremely disappointed in the last 2 or 3. Her character seem to become so self-absorbed and cold and too me, the books seemed to cover the same points over and over as if she was trying to stretch the book. Was not planning to buy the new book but, I decided after reading reviews that I would give her another chance. This book reminded me in alot of ways of the first books in the series and I enjoyed the read.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Accompanied by the London Philharmonic, this has to be her masterpiece. I just played it all the way through. Here are the tracks in order:<br /><br />Somewhere Over the Rainbow - lovely with perfect enunciation, crystal clear vocals and wistfulness<br />Winner Takes It All-- stunning work, emotive, powerful<br />Send In The Clowns- Best version I have ever heard<br />Music of the Night-- seductive, powerful- her soprano voice soars and her perfect enunciation again amazes<br />Bring Him Home-- she sings this beautifully, but be prepared for a tear jerker<br />Memory-- Clear as a bell in her vocals and shows off a nearly two octave range-- fabulous!<br />As Long As He Needs Me-- Sleeper of the CD! FANTASTIC- BLOWN AWAY BY THIS! powerful and passionate vocals- this is the stand out track on the cd-I cannot recommend this track more highly.<br />All I Ask of You---She sings in her highest lyric soprano on this one- outstanding duet with Donny O!<br />Out Here on My Own-- Can understand why she says this is a favorite- change of pace a bit- when she sings \\"Baby Be strong for me\\"- it is very sexy indeed.<br />YNWA-- Interesting arrangement, and Susan hits the highest notes with ease<br />This is the Moment-- The best duet ( imho) on the album- her voice and Donny's blend so perfectly<br /><br />This album fulfills the promise of the audition. Susan is in all her glory-- there is drama, and she  uses her powerful voice when needed, her highest ranges, which have been missing on her other CD's,  her seductive voice, and her introspective tones -- in other words, it is many shades. It is a MUST HAVE CD for ANYONE who enjoys great music and a one of a kind voice! Kudos to all involved!!<br />Run, do not walk, to buy this CD for everyone you know

B004YM6JI2|5.0|I keep watching this TV show from Season 1 to Season Seven.  I like the actress and their stories.  I will keep watching it in future.  Highly recommend.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I enjoy a good mystery story, but this book far exceeded my expectations! Definitely a period piece, but riveting nonetheless. Excellent read!<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />NC Miles
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I absolutely loved watching this series growing up and couldn't wait to buy it! When I found it on here for such a great price (much, much cheaper than anywhere else), I just had to get it. Some have said that they had problems with some of their DVDs in the series, but I have yet to run across any issues and I'm into season 4. If you love the west, romance, thrills, small town drama, and fun then this is definitely the series for you! Worth the time and money for sure!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7-8 year old loves this game.  Plays it all the time.  I am not the gamer, so I don't know much about it.  He figured it out himself.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|After I watch the first season on TV, I keep chasing it for every season.  Even to purchase and own one by myself.
B007UW9WOQ|4.0|\\"Jiro Dreams Of Sushi\\" is a fascinating and enjoyable treatment of a man,<br />a culinary art and a culture all masterfully wrapped up in one great video presentation.<br />You needn't enjoy Sushi or cooking to appreciate this documentary,<br />but you will love it even more if you do.<br />My only criticism is that a movie about a very tradtional Japanese man<br />and a very traditional Japanese culinary art in Japan, a very traditional Japanese place<br />is set to a musical score of Western European music.<br />It would have been so much better if the score was traditional Japanese music.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My favorite book in the series .  Wish it wasn't over already, but it was a nice ending. Happy reading!
B0026IQYEU|5.0|I had first seen the movie when I had HBO and couldn't get it out of my mind. The acting, the story, the directing, all excellent. A top recommend! I actually bought the movie so I can watch it any time on my laptop.
B003L77GGK|5.0|As I recommend the Season Seven.  This TV show will let you keep chasing once you see it.  If you miss one season, you will get lose.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|A little too much gore for my taste but all-in-all a decent story line and entertaining.  Not sutable for children under 13 by any means, not for foul language but for the ick factor.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club is an epic novel by Chuck Palahniuk and will not disappoint most readers. The book is mainly written as adult fiction, but is a medium for all age groups who might be interested in the Human mind. The book hits on various aspects of the human psyche while taking the reader on a journey that will have them on the edge of their seat throughout. The struggle of the main character (who is never named) to combat his mayhem-causing second personality is a topic not many writers are eager to jump into. The book's perilous plot, but loveable characters are sure to keep the reader's attention through the minute, two-hundred page book. Although sometimes hard to understand, Palahniuk's writing style is pretty straight-forward' steering clear of difficult vocabulary and unnecessary scene description. The book's greatest triumphs are its subtle hints at furthering the plot and suspenseful ending. While being one of the books greatest triumphs, though, the subtle hints are sometimes too subtle, and make the text quite difficult to understand for the average reader. Fight Club's is an absolute thrill to read and (while it is not a necessarily lengthy read) will has so much material in it that readers will stay awake at night thinking of that name ... Tyler Durden.

B001EC2J20|5.0|Incredible streaming, even on a weak signal. Also a great movie series, definitely worth buying or renting on Amazon. Lots of fast paced action and kick-butt fighting in this movie. Plan on renting/buying the last movie too, because this movie leads directly into it.

141659521X|4.0|A little over ten years ago, I was given a book by a coworker. He said, \\"This is way better than Tom Clancy.\\" I was offended, not because I knew Clancy, but because I knew of him as an author that wrote great narrative blended with incredibly accurate, action-packed stories. My coworker was right. Vince Flynn is an excellent author. He has created a main character who is not afraid to have an opinion or take a stand. Flynn's series of books can be read in any order, and it's nothing short of a treat to discover the background of his characters when reading chronologically earlier titles.<br /><br />Vince Flynn has written another title, The Last Man, which is as eerily prescient as his earlier Memorial Day. As I began to read the advanced copy from Atria Books, a Simon & Schuster imprint, the news of an actual terrorist strike on the US Embassy in Libya hit the front page of every news site and newspaper.<br /><br />Flynn's uncanny timing unfolds with his go-to main character, Mitch Rapp, as he is called on to rescue a missing CIA agent from a safe house in Afghanistan. While not exactly what was unveiled in actual world events, the author does capture the very real world of secret operatives working off the radar in hostile territories. Irene Kennedy, the only person able to reign in Rapp's destructive prowess, leaves the safety of her office to aid in the rescue mission. Mitch Rapp and his elite crew strike out to retrieve their target from the hands of the bad guys, while elements within the US and Afghan governments attempt to foil his efforts out of a need to hide their nefarious purposes.<br /><br />Perhaps the idea is not entirely past its prime, but the idea of a kidnapped, US government official being rescued from terrorists is not a new theme in the recent fiction and non-fiction genres. Maybe this is bad timing on the part of the publisher, but the non-fiction No Easy Day, released a month ago contains the basic elements of The Last Man. David Crouch's fictional Act of Valor also has the same basic premise. If Vince Flynn was not the author, I wouldn't have read the book. Overall, I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable, but it's a title I wouldn't choose to read a second time.<br /><br />The characters are believable, high-strung and thuggish, but believable. Flynn is also a master at retaining the basic humanity of his main character. Although Mitch Rapp is a Rambo-like tactical genius, he is still very much human. He can be hurt. His friends can be hurt. Few elements in the story are predictable, taking turns when least expected.<br /><br />However, it struck me that the last few novels by the author don't contain the same edgy pace of previous books. The imagery is not as vivid, nor is the dialogue. And the basic story line has been done. The language is certainly military-grade, rough, tough and full of zingers, but strangely, it didn't really enhance the action as I expected.<br /><br />I recommend the story for fans of the genre and of the author. I would also recommend this book if you want a good read where you know the good guy will win.<br /><br />This story is definitely high quality when compared to other writers in the genre. Only when comparing Vince Flynn to himself do I find certain elements lacking. This is an excellent story, but it is not the best Mitch Rapp novel on my shelf.ctional Act of Valor also has the same basic premise. If Vince Flynn was not the author, I wouldn't have read the book.

B007SSEBCU|3.0|I enjoyed this move mostly because the acting was superb.  I was disappointed with the actual movie because I was hoping for more in depth analysis of her career.  It might have been more satisfying if the movie concentrated a smaller part of her life and not just glimpses of her whole life.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Generally I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series but found this latest to be less tightly written and pulled together.  I'd still buy it again, but I'm hoping for yet another book that's as good as her earlier books.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|I don't buy music much anymore since Pandora and Spotify fulfill most of my listening needs, but Blak and Blu is such a cool, grooving album that it warranted a buy. It doesn't disappoint!
0316228532|1.0|This is a book that I started but did not finish I could not work up any interest in the characters. Ii is far from the level of Harry Potter.
0385535147|4.0|I can vividly remember a cold snowy day in Chicago when I was a teenager and my mom came home and said \\"I saw this book at the library that you may like.\\" It was \\"The Firm\\" by John Grisham and as they say the rest was history.  Since then, I have read almost every single book by Grisham. I don't mention that as some sort of literary accomplishment but rather because whenever I read a new Grisham thriller, I tend to measure it against The Firm which was in my opinion his greatest book yet.<br /><br />The Racketeer clearly falls into the legal thriller genre and is more of a classic Grisham than some of his more recent forays into non-fiction and kid's fiction.  It is about a guy named Malcom Bannister who is sitting in prison and scheming to get out.  His ha an ace up his sleeve which is knowledge of a crime committed against a famous local federal judge and his girlfriend at a remote cabin. The crime was murder and the story revolves around what was in a safe that was found empty at the judge's cabin.  What turns out to have been in the save is something that will amaze even Grisham's most loyal readers and is also something that will enrich Malcom beyond his and his colleague's wildest dreams.  The story takes endless twists and turns and every time you think you have it figured out, you will be sent in a slightly different direction. Watch out for the heavy drinking trailer dude who makes a very important appearance in the story as well.  This is a well-written Grisham thriller that will keep you tuned in and rushing to the finish.
B008G33OJM|1.0|Same as everyone else here, got the Blu ray that I pre-ordered months ago, popped it into my PS3 and just get the warning screens, never moves on to the menu. Very Disappointing. Amazon really does need to stop selling this, as it is clear that is does not work for many people.

B009KKLQKO|1.0|Bad Vibrations...<br /><br />This product is just more proof of how the Boys' Marketing geniuses totally missed the mark... again.  I saw them at Pine Knob in the summer and everyone agrees how awesome the 50th Concert was.  I knew that they were going to release it on Blue Ray/DVD.  I wouldn't have thought they'd only include some the the concert performances.  But it doesn't really surprise me.  They waited around 50 years to release stereo versions of all their earlier classic albums from Capitol.  Thanks, at least, for giving us that.  But this next blunder will force me to get a bootleg or import version of a bunch of really old songs that have been reissued by Capitol a million times.  I'll simply wait for the British version, since regardless of where you saw and heard it live, it really was a very wonderful experience to share with my son.  But, not a chopped up version that some idiot sitting somewhere deciding how many more times they can exploit such old material. The boys will get one chance to take more money from me for this great concert.  The full version is all I will legally purchase.  Screw the idiots that have been  ripping us loyal BB Fans for over 50 years! Enough is enough, and that's too much.<br /><br />Signed;  Here we go again!
B00913P6G0|5.0|this is an excellent rap album. you can get the sense of old school west coast hip hop, but he still remains to make it feel contemporary. I also got the album the day it came out at like 1030 so the shipping was great.
B0091574VI|5.0|We were all drawn in by the amazing footage. It was a wonderful movie and not the normal 'documentary' style but Disney style.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Three and a half stars, actually.  So I suppose I could have clicked four stars.  But people are such easy graders.  What--we don't want to hurt the author's feelings?  Besides, The Great Gatsby gets 4 Amazon stars and Life of Pi isn't half the book Gatsby is.  Fifty Shades of Grey -- possibly the most ineptly written book in the history of the world -- also gets four Amazon stars.  So it's hard to know what to do.  I just peeked, and Jonathan Livingston Seagull gets 4.25 stars.  So who really cares?<br /><br />I resisted reading this for a long time.  In fact, I only decided to jump in when I saw the movie was coming and I thought I should read the book first.  And there's no getting around it.  This book is charming.  Absolutely charming.  I guess my push-back has more to do with not understanding how it managed more than a year on the New York Times bestseller list.  Is that a reason to pan a book?  All I know is that I thought it was going to be wonderful and it turned out to be charming.  In parts.<br /><br />Usually when I review things I offer a couple of specifics to back up my position.  I'm not so motivated with this one.  But I will say this:  there's a lot of time spent in the first half of the book grappling with God and comparative religion.  Little Pi is quite a spiritual boy--no doubt.  And you feel like all this is pointing towards some extraordinary moment of realization at the end of the book.  But it never comes.  The ending is cute, but not satisfying.<br /><br />I would say read it.  Expect some fun.  But don't expect wonderment.<br /><br />To quote Peggy Lee:  \\"Is that all there is?\\"
B00843TZJM|5.0|Good lighting, Good sound. The artists are outstanding and so are the musics. I recommend this show to everyone that likes CSN
B005LAIHR2|2.0|Yes, Tom C. and what music there is would be the only reason to buy this movie atrocity of the Broadway hit. In fact, the cast was very good except for Diego Boneta (a major casting error). Boneta was so weak that he couldn't hold up his part to the standard of the heavy-weights around him (including the monkey).  Too bad they were all fighting a losing battle as the story, fun, structure, and music were gutted and mutated so far from the original and in the worst way.  Adam Shankman proves that he is an egotistical no talent hack (and honestly that is being overly kind).  It drives me crazy that this movie insult even exists as it is extremely doubtful that a decent version will ever be made.  For a real good time see the live show, apparently Shankman didn't.
0142419400|5.0|There are some books that people rave about, and you have to wonder how good they can actually be. Anna and the French Kiss was one of those books. Every blogger and reviewer I came across gushed about this book. And with good reason. It really is as good as everyone says it is.<br /><br />I hate to be a gushing, squeeing fangirl, but I really, really loved this book! It was simple but in the most beautiful, brilliant, perfect way. I finished this book almost two weeks ago and I've been putting off my review because my thoughts are so personal; it's like I want to be greedy and keep them all to myself. But this book was too good not to share, so here goes...<br /><br />I guess I'll start with Anna. She was so likeable and easy to relate to. She reminded me a lot of myself in some ways - kind of unsure and awkward, wanting to fit in...I saw a lot of myself in her, right down to the gap in her front teeth. There's this sweetness and innocence about her that I just loved.<br /><br />As for Etienne...I lost count of the times I swooned over that boy! He's funny, sweet, smart, protective, easy-going, and wants to make people happy. He seems perfect, but he's really not, and I loved that about him.<br /><br />Anna and Etienne's relationship...I loved how they started out as friends, and I loved watching their relationship blossom. I thought the little observations they made about each other, and the fact that they knew each other so well was adorable. They talked about real things, and genuinely became best friends, even as their feelings for each other developed. I was rooting so hard for them to just get together already, but at the same time, I loved their friendship and the dynamic between them.<br /><br />Another thing that really drew me in was the setting. I went to Paris when I was 17 (same age as Anna, go figure); it's so rare for me to read a book set somewhere I've actually been. Most books are set in fictional places, or big cities that I've never been like New York or London or Dublin or Chicago. But I've actually been to Paris, and I got to see a lot of the stuff Anna saw. I came to think of Paris as an extra character in the book, and loved the parts where Anna, Etienne, and their friends were out in the city doing things.<br /><br />I actually learned a few things too, which is always exciting for me because I love to learn, and I love to know seemingly useless little facts. My head is full of them. For instance, do you know the difference between a cemetery and a graveyard? I didn't before reading Anna. Nor did I know the difference between a gargoyle and a chimera.<br /><br />This book was just perfection to me. I laughed (and laughed and laughed and laughed some more), cried, swooned, fell in love, and felt like I was losing a best friend when the story ended. Anna was such an incredible character, and I enjoyed following her on her journey as she learned sometimes-painful lessons about life, love, friendship, family, independence, and courage.w York or London or Dublin or Chicago.

B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I usually see all animation films but missed this one.  It was great.  A nice twist on the original tale.  The characters  were not irritating or overly sweet.  You could lose yourself in the story and enjoy the ride.  The horse was my favorite.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Exactly what I needed for my electronic scale. Some said that I should just buy another scale, cheaper than finding and buying a battery. Boy were they wrong!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I honestly don't know how I came upon The Racketeer. I thought I was clicking on another book. I've been reading many sample books and buying only those I truly felt were worthy, such as [[ASIN:1470000342 Note to Self]] by Valentine deFrancis, a total MUST READ for all you ladies, and [[ASIN:B009LBO334 The Secret of Ella and Micha]], And now I'm going to buy The Racketeer. Just reading these sample pages has me hooked. It's a no wonder why Grisham is a best selling author. Can't wait to read it, and I'm giving his sample chapters 5-Stars off the bat.
B0097UO87U|4.0|I very much enjoy this compilation.  The selection is excellent, as well as the orchestration.  Unfortunately it's way too short in duration.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|This microphone is good enough for semi-professional recording, but it creates noise when I use it, which is not good for professional musician.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I saw the trailer for this last year and was intrigued. In my youth the Saturday movies had lots of \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" encounters, so I smiled at this new take-off on the old \\"oaters.\\" The film was all I could expect. It is well done with a good plot line and convincing actors. I was surprised to find authentic Apache Indians involved speaking their own language! Olivia Wilde did a convincing portrayal. The location scenery was beautiful.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The last truly awesome book I read was [[ASIN:1470000342 Note to Self]] by Valentine deFrancis and it wasn't until now that I have found another book worthy of being called a page turner.  There are tons of twists and turns in this book that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.  If you love intrigue and suspense, then this is a good one for you.  I do agree with a lot of the other Amazon customers that there is some Kindle price gouging going on, however.  Seems like purchasing the paperback on this one would be the way to go and you could always share it with a friend.  Great book though.  Looking forward to more.
B008OB1QFK|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a good album, but its definitely not my favorite by Chris Knight. I was looking for more along the lines of The Trailer Tapes, Enough Rope & Heart of Stone. I love those albums.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I love this book I only took away the one star because of the ending. It is such a cliff hanger!!!!!!!!:0
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Not a bad album, but I expected more. There are way too many ballads. I dont want an Aerosmith album that is 2/3 adult contemporary. There are a few songs that rock. Legendary Child and Street Jesus are both pretty good.  But if you want an album that kicks your ass, get the new KISS album Monster !! There are several new albums out by 70s/80s bands that I would recommend . Rush, ZZ Top, KISS and Van Halen all have good new albums out.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Book was good.  Seems like the author cut a few corners in its creation though.<br />I enjoyed it.  I always enjoy this author.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|The product page for this cover provides all the details. So I won't be redundant.<br /><br />Of the several Kindle Fire covers I've seen up close and personal, I find this one of the more attractive. The design is richly sophisticated without being showy. It feels nice in the hand. And it does not reek of chemicals.<br /><br />I'm still a little astounded at the prices for these covers, especially given the rate at which the new, next-generation products they house are being issued.  But if you have a cash, this is a nice choice.
B00756GKBA|5.0|What a great album Madonna has released!<br />This album incorporates a few elements from her last few cds (you recognize elements from Ray of Light, Music, American Life and Confessions) and adds new elements of dance music (dubstep being the most obvious) in what ends up being a much more personnal album than the singles have indicated so far.  This is great dance Madonna music that reflects on her feelings regarding the end of her marriage and where she's at now in her life.  Ultimately she survived the ordeal and wants to move on with positive fun messages and lyrics.  A really great album that I enjoyed very much.

0307730697|5.0|This is the first book I ever read about a Navy SEAL and now I read every SEAL book I can find; however, this book is so well written that there is no comparison. The author takes you into the world of a SEAL, both at home and at war.

My husband read it in one day and we have passed it to many people--all have had the same opinion--AMAZING!<br /><br />This book is a tribute to a real hero. Read it. You will not be dissapointed.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|Politics in film tend to mirror present day events -- the conflicts and issues in Iron Lady are not far from those we deal with now, but then, it wasn't all that long ago. Of course, the filmmakers struck a balance between the public life and private life of a iconic figure, played by an iconic actor.<br /><br />Streep is so far beyond the powers of mere mortals now, it's almost a given that she would deliver on what could have been a caricature (especially in England, where mock Thatchers are part of popular comedy). Though at times she reminded me of the character she played in The Devil Wears Prada, this performance was astonishing, as so many have already said.<br /><br />Streep is surrounded by superb actors in a storyline that avoids clich&eacute; by using \\"dead\\" characters for the Thatcher character to chat with, eliminating countless flashbacks and exposition. This is not new, but it's done very well here and never loses the thread.<br /><br />My only criticism is of the DVD package (thus the four stars) -- there is no audio commentary and the few bonus features are basically short promos cut from the longer one. With so much to draw upon, it would have been nice to get more background material.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Good game.  Enjoyed playing but got tired of all the conversations between the characters.  The puzzles were somewhat repetitious.  Would recommend this game.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a very well crafted book, with excellent period-accurate dialog.  You'll need French, German, Japanese and Korean translation services.  I found Google and Alta Vista helpful.  I read non-stop for several days, fried my eyes, and enjoyed Cloud Atlas very much.  If you enjoyed A Canticle for Leibowitz, you will enjoy this book.

B009H442DG|5.0|The novelty of the \\"Grease\\" reunion and the charities aside, this album is what Christmas is all about: light-hearted, spirited, and unadulterated FUN!  And not only to hear John & Olivia together again, but to be joined by the likes of Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, and Tony Bennett!  \\"I Think You Might Like It\\" will stick in your head, and you can't help but picture \\"Danny\\" and \\"Sandy\\" cozying up on a stormy night when it's \\"Cold Outside.\\"  Forget the seriousness of the holiday and just enjoy some pure light fun.  Merry Christmas indeed!

B00127RAJY|4.0|The program by Jillian is great.  Truly motivating!  Great workout in a compressed time!  Perfect for those that can only get in a 20-30 minute workout.<br /><br /> - The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because of the non-fast forward introduction.  I would love to pop the dvd in and move forward to my program. Not wait to get through the ad and beginning.
B004FA8NOQ|4.0|As everyone else has stated... this processor is a beast and will last you many years without the need to upgrade. But as I implied in my title, watch your RAM speeds. This processor is only rated to handle up to 1333 MHZ RAM speeds. Most enthusiast RAM speeds are 1600mhz+ and when I used 1600 mhz RAM, this processor failed on me after 2 months. I might of got away with it, but I was also overclocking the processor up to 4.0ghz and it finally died on me. Luckily, Intel has awesome customer service and replaced the processor under warranty. They warned me not to use any RAM over 1333 mhz with this processor.<br /><br />Hope this saves someone else the trouble of replacing every single component in your system to find out it was the processor that failed (first time this has ever happened to me).

1423140605|5.0|I absolutely loved the book! It's fun, it's sad, it's romantic, there's action, a little bit of everything! It definitely met my expectations. I'd recommend it to anyone keen on mythology and fantasy, regardless the age of the reader.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|Anyone who's had the pleasure of experiencing Timur Bekmambetov's brilliant Russian films, \\"Nightwatch\\" and \\"Daywatch\\" knows what he's capable of.  As often happens, his Americanized filmmaking is less satisfying, with commercial concerns obsuring pure, rash inovation.  Even so, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a good popcorn movie with some nice visuals.  If you're looking for historical drama, look elsewhere.  But, if laugh-out-loud absurd action pleases you, you'll enjoy this one, as I did.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Watched with a few friends, we laughed. This is one of those movies that go better with beer and pizza. It's what you expect with a few twists and turns, as well as some totally over the top stupidity. Can barely remember most of it now, and perhaps that's for the best.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love this movie. So imaginative, and my two year old loves it too! I thought it might be a little dark for him, but I was wrong. And its a great way to introduce him to Tom Hanks!

1451613512|1.0|This book portrays itself as \\"untold history\\". But often rather than \\"untold history\\", its simply the often-said political platforms of days gone by.<br /><br />What it most resembles is a book from a while back by Pat Buchanan. In the book, Buchanan took up the cause of the isolationists and those worse than isolationists in the second world war. It was a suicidal enterprise in that he was attempting to take up a bad cause from an era long past.<br /><br />Stone has a similar problem. In his case, he tries to take up the cause of the apologists for the Soviet Union from the 1940s and 1950s. He then welds those rather bad causes to his traditional Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon narrative. But the causes of the 1940s and 1950s he takes up only weakens his old narrative. Where one might take his claims about Vietnam seriously, those claims are not helped by attacking the United States for its role in WWII, attacking the Marshall Plan, blaming the US government for the Korean War and blaming the US exclusively for the entire cold war from beginning to end. In taking up a whole series of bad historical causes, he only undermines his point of view.<br /><br />There is nothing particularly \\"untold\\" about the views expressed in the book (originating on the far left) on the second world war. We all know that the Americans were all lazy loafers who cynically held back while the Soviet Union \\"won\\" the war. We all know that the American War effort, unlike that of the Soviet Union, was a genocidal criminal enterprise bombing cities and using nuclear weapons. Its all old hat thats been around for decades. But its old hat that nobody takes seriously because its nonsense.<br /><br />There is also nothing \\"untold\\" about the political agenda of the \\"progressive\\" party in 1948 and its hatred of President Truman. The fact that Henry Wallace could only muster 2.4% of the national vote in 1948 might indicate to those less fanatic than the authors as to why the democratic party went with Harry Truman.<br /><br />There is nothing untold in presenting an unfair one-sided account of the orgins of the cold war which blames the United States (and Truman) for everything. These pro-soviet accounts of the cold war have been around for decades and so have their critics. The failure of this so-called \\"untold history\\" to engage with those often decades old critiques of its arguments weakens the book still further. The authors often try to be Zinn or Chomsky, but are not clever enough to pull even that off.<br /><br />We get the usual history of the United States as being led by a series of madmen of one sort or another who are constantly threatening the peace-loving soviet people with nuclear war. They are all generally the same. They are either the evil stooges of empire or they are useful idiots who don't understand the basic evil of the United States and its every action in the world.<br /><br />There are instances where the authors are simply wrong. For example, they miss all of the infighting within the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin. We are told that the Soviet Union had already decided on a different foreign policy at Stalin's funeral which is of course long before it was even clear within the Soviet Union who would be the leadership.<br /><br />Sometimes the claims are just crazy. The book says, for example, that the Korean War happened because the Soviet Union was excluded from the final treaty of peace with Japan. That the Korean War was essentially a defensive effort by the Soviet Union against the threat of an \\"economically and militarily\\" strengthened Japan. They get credit for originality and dumping the old story of their intellectual friends that the Korean War was an American attack on North Korea/Soviet Union. But it still doesn't work. They do slightly cling to the old stories in that the author's claim that Stalin was launching a preventative war to head off an invasion of North Korea.<br /><br />The 1950s narrative is entirely familiar. Guatamala. Vietnam. Cuba. Iran. McCarthy. Its essentially a set of very much told \\"untold history\\".<br /><br />In regard to the Kennedys, he tells \\"truths\\" wrapped in things less than true. When JFK ducked the McCarthy vote or supported red baiters, it was just a good man helping a friend of the family. Robert Kennedy may go to work for Joe McCarthy, but none of this tells us anything about these men who the authors say later rose to such \\"heights\\". Even in his counterfactual history, Stone really can't bring himself to dump his rather mystical worship of the Kennedy family. Even when the left of the democratic party which he uses often as his sources for history diverge with his views on them, he sticks to his Kennedy mythology.<br /><br />There are some new bits. The Kennedy-Khrushchev summit went wrong, we are told, because the peace-loving Soviet Union was convinced that the United States was going to hand over nuclear weapons to West Germany. Rather than being Soviet aggression, the Berlin crisis was entirely the fault of Americans.<br /><br />The Cuban missile crisis? Again. All America's fault. The Soviet Union was simply deploying missles to cuba to save itself from an American nuclear first strike on the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The missle crisis, as per Stone's usual mythology, is JFK's come-to-jesus moment. The usual laundry list of things (leaving Vietnam, normal relations with cuba, disarmament, shutting down NASA, forming alliances with third world revolutionary movements) that never actually happened under Kennedy are presented. All mostly wishful thinking rather than anything like history. The missle crisis turns Kennedy into a living god and repository for every utopian political idea. That Kennedy the god is so at odds with Kennedy the mortal president in the historical record isn't up for discussion.<br /><br />In a very odd turn, the authors claim that Kennedy was the political reincarnation of Henry Wallace. And that the assasination was directly parallel to Wallace being thrown off the democratic presidental ticket in 1944. Thats about six steps too far. JFK at his most idealistic moment was nowhere near the politics of Wallace. To suggest that Kennedy was preparing to run in 1964 as the wallace-like candidate of the far left in the democratic party is, putting it kindly, delusional.<br /><br />Past Kennedy, the book becomes a very conventional history of Oliver Stone's America. We get the standard history of Lyndon Johnson as evil warmonger. We get the standard history of Richard Nixon as madman. We get the standard history of Reagan, Iran-Contra, Central America all leading up the usual story of how 9/11 is the fault of the United States because of its evil war against the peace efforts of the Soviet Army after it invaded Afghanistan. All leading up to the presentation of Obama as another sort of useful idiot to the forces of evil running America. I'm at a loss to know what of any of this was much \\"untold history\\".<br /><br />One of the claims around this book is that it wants to punch a hole in American exceptionalism. It doesn't do that effectively because:<br /><br />a) Its too weded to being counter-history. To being an inverse of the traditional narrative. In trying to invert the narrative, it tends to excess. It tends to draw conclusions that are simply a flawed mirrior of the conventional narrative.<br /><br />b) Stone is unwilling to challenge his own personal ideas about history even when they are inconsistant with the broader story he is trying to tell. The Kennedy family story is not up for discussion or any re-evaluation. Kennedy was going to build utopia in 1964. End of discussion. What actually happened in the year between the cuban missle crisis (when Kennedy transformed supposedly) and the assasination doesn't matter as much as what people around him thought he was going to do. If the facts don't support the myth, go with the myth.<br /><br />c) The long portions of the book beyond the Kennedy years have nothing new to say that has not already been said by many including Stone himself.<br /><br />d) Making Henry Wallace such a key part of the argument was a bad idea. The \\"progressive\\" movement had their chance at the 1944 democratic convention and in the 1948 election. They lost on both occasions because while they were big on talk, they were short on votes.<br /><br />The book presents a picture of America as an eternally evil country beyond any redemption composed entirely of war criminals and their accomplices from top to bottom. The only exception in all of American history being somehow John F. Kennedy between the dates of October 28, 1962 and November 22, 1963.parallel to Wallace being thrown off the democratic presidental ticket in 1944. Thats about six steps too far.

B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a fun game. the only thing that sucks is waiting for your new eggs to hatch. lol  i still like it tho
B002JVWR4A|5.0|What is there to say.  If you love Bones like my family, you have to have the collection in case you need to see an episode or have an all day marathon.  We have every season, and keep new ones saved on tivo until the next season comes out.  Obsessive you say?  Yes and proud of it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Everything I heard about this film made me think I would hate it. I dont like Judy Dench in James Bond films. I dont like films about cyber-terrorism. I don't like films that dwell on the personal lives of James Bond and M. I went it with complete doubt and the film won me over. Everything I expected to be bad was done exceptionally well. They avoided every film cliche and kept things true to the character of Bond.<br /><br />Daniel Craig continues to have an incredible presence on screen as Bond. He reinvented the character as a legtimate tough guy and he has a presence of actual menace that no previous actor had. That is not to say he is \\"best\\" or better than others who have played the part, but he has found an original way to play the part true to the character which is unique.<br /><br />The plot and the villian were well thought out. They used the idea of cyber-terrorism, but didn't overly dwell on it to the exclusion of other things. They used the idea to kick off in a whole other direction. The villian had compelling and understandable motivations. He had a plan that was (mostly) well thought out. The plan *built* progressively to a pay-off that was more than worth it.<br /><br />The contrasts between hi-tech and low-tech running through the film are part of what makes the cyber-terrorism thing work so well.<br /><br />The various exotic backdrops were original and interesting. Shanghai in particular. It was contemporary (rather than a standard Bond location) and visually very well done. London was put to good use as well.<br /><br />Judy Dench did fine work. Her best work in a bond film by far. It was written and acted pitch-perfect. There were so many ways it could have gone wrong. It could have drown in sentementality or been untrue to the characters. But they got everything exactly right. Giving Bond backstory is always incredibly dangerous but they did it the right way. The fault of many films is that backstory becomes a leaping off point into psychological analysis or looking for behavioral causes. They did none of that. They also managed several nostalgia moments that were just long enough to be good.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is introduced as what seems like a useless predictable character familiar from so many films. But he does the near impossible these days in that grows the character into something else through the course of the film and does it with brilliant, short bits of acting. He does very simple things exceptionally well.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace (the previous film) was an average disappointment as a film. But Skyfall is one of the very best bond films. It was nothing I expected it to be and thats a very good thing.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Very thin and uninformative.  No doubt the author had a vivid experience but his rendition of it is lacking in detail regarding what he experienced and specifically why he draws the conclusions he does. Clearly the author had an experience very real to him, but because there is very little detail or information that would indicate it had any other reality, and seems to base its validity on his personal credentials which are irrelevant to someone in the throws of the serious illness he battled, this book offers little if anything at all in support of his conclusions.  I am among the individuals he regards as his \\"target audience\\" so I was very interested in reading what his experience was.  However, after reading this book, I can only conclude that neuroscience is still at a nascent stage and that we are far from understanding the point at which a form of life is dead.

1476712042|5.0|I must have picked this book up so many times contemplating buying it.  Well I gave in and sunk into the couch and started reading it, next thing I knew I was closing the book and it was 3am.  The book introduced a lot of characters all at once and it took a bit to sort them out, but once they focused on Abby and Travis you are hooked.  You can sort of see their relationship coming miles away, but the complete destruction takes you by surprise.<br /><br />I felt like I was reading the mix between Fight Club and some romantic comedy.  For the first time in a while I thought this book needs to be a movie - if the book is that good, I don't like to see Hollywood mess it up - but this story was made to be a chick flick.<br /><br />Travis is the bad boy that we all want to tame and Abby is the girl that you pull for, hoping she will risk a bit to get the guy wants.  I fell in love with these two instantly.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a spin on the typical boy meets girl type book.  And I can't wait until Walking Disaster is released to see his point of view!

1401324649|5.0|It is the year 2005 in the town of Malmkoping, Sweden.  A birthday party is planned at the Old Folks' Home for Allan Karlsson.  He is 100 years old.  Everyone will be there including the Mayor, the Journal and Photographer, the staff and the old folks who live there.  There is a lot of excitement going on, but Allan is not interested.  He decides to escape.<br /><br />Allan's room is on the ground floor.  He's wearing a brown jacket with brown trousers and on his feet he is wearing a pair of brown indoor slippers.  He climbs out the window and steps out into the flower bed.  He is on the run from his own birthday party.  He wonders if he should climb back in for his shoes and his hat, but when he felt his wallet in his inside pocket, he decides to be on his way.  He knows that Alice, the Director, would be fishing around for him.  He had thought it would be his last residence on Earth and then he tells himself that he can die some other time, in some other place.  Allan sets off in his pee-slippers (so called because men of advanced age rarely pee farther than their shoes).  After walking a few hundred yards, he sits down on a bench next to some gravestones to rest his aching knees.  He is a fairly healthy man, but he is 100 years old.  Allan continues his walk until a stone wall appears in his path.  It was about three feet high and Allan is a centenarian, not a high jumper.  He walks to the lowest end of the wall and climbs over in spite of his age and knees.<br /><br />On the other side was Malmkoping's bus station.  The station waiting room was almost empty when Allan shuffles in.  He asks the man at the booth how far his money would take him.  While at the bus terminal, Allan meets a young man with a suitcase.  The young man asks Allan if he could mind his suitcase, because he had to go to the bathroom.  Allan says that he would and as soon as the door closes, Allan's bus comes along.  So not thinking, he gets on the bus with the suitcase on wheels.  When the young man appears, his suitcase has been stolen by the old man.  The young man is furious and he threatens the man at the booth to give him the information he needs to catch Allan and his stolen suitcase.<br /><br />In the meantime, everyone including the Police is searching for Allan.  They have gathered some information and they are on their way to find him.  He can't be too far.<br /><br />Along the way, when he gets off at his stop, it's pretty cold out there with just slippers on.  There is one house in the wilderness, where a man lives all alone.  He welcomes Allan in with his suitcase.  The man prepares a hot meal and a little shot of what Allan likes and Allan feels much better.  Allan would like to open the suitcase to see if he can find a pair of shoes, but the suitcase is locked.  His new friend agrees to help, when someone is at the door.<br /><br />You wonder what's in the suitcase.  Does the young man ever find Allan?  Do the Police find him?  Who is that strange man that took him in?  Does he return to the Old Folks' Home?  What happens to dear old Allan?<br /><br />The book goes back in time to the years 1929-1939, when Allan was a young man.  Allan had witnessed some of the most important events of the twentieth century.  He played a key role in them too.<br /><br />Allan is a wise old man who doesn't sweat the small stuff.  He is mischievous, curious and loves to discover new places.  He loves life and still has so much to see and do.  Whatever will be, will be is his way of thinking.<br /><br />Jonas Jonasson created a character that is so much fun to read about.  People compare Allan to Forrest Gump.  To all the readers out there, I guarantee you'll be laughing from beginning to end.  I loved this book and enjoyed every page.<br /><br />I highly recommend The 100-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared for the sheer pleasure it will give you.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|At the end I got tired of all the sex scenes and thought the plot was a little weak. Still an easy and interesting reading!
B009329Y30|4.0|The Lucky One is fairly good, with a gentle overall tone.  The movie moves somewhat slowly at times, but the acting is good and the story line is interesting to consider.  Overall, it's a good film for a quiet night with your loved one.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Read the first book in the trilogy to see what everyone was talking about. This one had everything you expected after the first book. Most of it was as expected and not as interesting as the first one.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just look for items. I don't follow the &quot;game&quot; because it is confusing. It is really small too so some of the items are really hard to find.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed most of the book.  It kept me reading longer than I planned, everytime I picked it up.<br /> Somewhere, I'm not sure where exactly, the action seemed to reach a climax and after that<br /> it just wandered on to the end.  I did like most of it.
0307279189|5.0|If this book doesn't make you want to get off your ass and tear around your local park as fast as you can, there is no hope for you! A great read about a hidden culture and the runner in all of us.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads

B00471TLZS|3.0|It may have been good back in the 80s, but its just not scary anymore.  Part of it might be that the special effects are now cheesy and not believable, but I wasn't really scared at any point.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I found this book surprisingly enchanting. I don't think you have to be a fan of A WRINKLE IN TIME to enjoy this book, but certainly understanding some of the references helps.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching the story unfold in front of me and seeing how all the pieces fit together. This is the first book in a while that I found myself going back and reading a few chapters again- sometimes as I was reading through, certainly after I finished, to see how it all came together right under Miranda's, and my nose.<br /><br />Miranda goes through all the normal trials of 12-year old girlhood- losing friends, finding new ones, finding her footing in her neighborhood (this was the 70s when kids were more free to roam) and in her family and yet while big lessons are learned, none of it seems overly dramatic or preachy. Miranda is a wonderful participant and observer in her own story, which makes this one trip back through time I'd gladly make again.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Well, where do I start? When I first heard about the release of this book I was dying to read it. The thought of a main stream physician, not one of those with a PHD in parapsychology, would publicly release a book describing his NDE experiences was the book for me. I was counting the days. Little did I know that disappointment was around the corner.<br /><br />Well, the release date came and I quick downloaded a kindle version of the book. The first thing I noticed was the size of the book - not so big. I thought that's kind of peculiar for someone who was a highly educated Neurosurgeon and dying to tell the world about the hereafter story from a scientific point of view. My thought before reading the book was we would get a quick chapter on what put him in hospital then delve right in on the \\"Proof of Heaven.\\" Well, what I got for the most part was proof that Dr. Alexander is well respected and loved by his colleagues, friends and family. Don't get me wrong, the story itself was an interesting read and shows the power of faith and family. For that I raised my rating to 3 stars, but for the rest, it was lacking severely. Some of the chapters were only 2 pages!!! Very little new insights were revealed with this book and those that were brought out needed more information - a lot more.<br /><br />After I read the book my thought after I turning the last page was \\"where's the beef?\\" I was a little confused due to the title being severely misleading. I was thinking the book should have been named \\"Proof that Family Matters\\" or \\"I had some heavenly experiences with family by my side.\\" These might have been more accurate titles and would give the potential buyer a better insight on what they were getting.<br /><br />Here's where I believe the book went wrong. He set the bar to high with the title. Proof of Heaven from an actual Neurosurgeon? Wow, that's going to be a powerful read. When the you read the book, the proof is not compelling, nor necessarily well thought out.However, do I think he actually had these experiences which he describes so briefly? Sure, you bet. But I think his mind was still trying to assimilate the information that was given him and really not ready to write a book with his current data. He himself noted that he's still trying to get his arms around what happened. I believe that if he sat on this information a while (a year??), collected more of his experiences and analyzed a bit further, then the \\"Proof of Heaven\\" just might have been there. Furthermore, I'm hoping that he decides not to write anymore 2 page chapters. I'm feeling a little cheated when I spend $10 bucks for a kindle book and the chapters are that short.<br /><br />My last thought was of the book's publisher. Where was the advise? Why did they choose the title? Why did they let the good doctor go astray? This reminds me of a recent movie I saw, \\"A Thousand Words,\\" featuring Eddy Murphy who played an account executive at a publishing house. His character was only looking at the money and was wanted to get the book out as fast as he can without even reading the books contents. I think the writers of the movie must have been taken a few pointers from this Dr. Alexander's publisher.<br /><br />Bottom line is... read the book if you have doubts and decide for yourself, because this is only my opinion. I think that Dr. Raymond Moody's books are a much better read from a spiritual perspective than Dr.Alexander's at this point.

B008DVJO8C|5.0|Do you want calm smoothing vocals and enjoy elevator music then this album is not for you. I'm not trying to dish on their earlier albums as there are some solid songs and strong vocals but this is the complete package.<br /><br />There is a line between pointless screaming and a scream that gets you out of your chair. This album is on par with Disturbed sickness. This is where I hope a trademark sound is born. If you want a sooth Amy Lee from Evanescence's this is not it.<br /><br />A friend asked \\"That was a woman?\\" YES!<br /><br />The band has been through a continuous transition and per the editorial review this one is darker and more gritty. The lyrics are a rougher tone of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. They may be inappropriate for young woman but life is rough sometimes and this album brings it out.<br /><br />Bottom line this is Disturbed meets Evanescence and Alanis Morissette. If you want a touchie feelie album get the Smurfs sound track. Want the Best Real Rock Album of the year hit play.<br /><br />Is it Dark? Yes!<br />Does it scream? Hell YES!<br />Will you play it over and over? Yes! Yes! Yes!<br /><br />Its not your 70s and 80's Rock this is music embedded with passion.<br />Their other music, if you this album then try A Star-Crossed Wasteland maybe Beautiful Tragedy but The Dream is missing some of the passion in this album.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The part of his brain in which consciousness abides (according to present knowledge) was not functioning.  Therefore, during the Near Death Experience (NDE), he had no self identity.  He did not know who he was, only that he was alive and he did not meet or recognize departed relatives.  Other people who undergo an NDE retain their self identity and meet departed relatives.  The differences seem to be in the functioning level of the earthly brain.  If he had retained his self identity while the conscious part of the brain was not functioning (at least according to the current level of medical testing), then I could accept his premise that his experience was, indeed, a proof of heaven.  In my view, you must retain self identity to insure that the real you lives on after the body decays.

030799029X|4.0|I belong to a book club.  We reviewed this book last month.  I was surprised that in the book when there was a change of location and time that the book changed fonts in the printing.  At first I was so confused and had to really concentrate to keep up.  After a chapter or two I got into the rhythm.  It was such a different type of book....you think you know where this is going and it takes off in a different direction without much warning.  I listened to it as I<br />drove on highways and I hated to get out of the car at certain times.<br />  It is also a kind of travel book which I thought was a good way to bring in more action.  Living in a foreign country is a very different way of life to younger women, expecially career women from the USA.  However women are women all over the world and gossip seems to be the engine that moves most conversation.<br />  Perhaps because of the type work that Kate had been involved in that she was always suspicious of everyone.  Even as a married couple she doubted her husband at every turn.  Not all our members of the book club found Kate endearing, some thought she was rather whiney.  I rather liked her.<br />  It is a great book about work, marriage, trust and secrecy.  My book club found this a intersting and delightful first novel.  We hope for more to come.

B004M3GDI4|5.0|Truly outstanding light. Great durable product that has 3 light options. There is not a job you cannot get done with this light. AA batteries a plus and low battery indicator is excellent. Used for working and cross country skiing. The only improvement, I could see is to make it a little lighter(very minor complaint). Some of the lower lumen lights are lighter so that may be a mute point. Great fit, solid construction, and easy to use. KM

0316228532|4.0|If Holden Caufield's soul was divided into seven horcruxes, each part bringing with it one aspect of his character, and put into new characters and set it in the English country side instead of New York City, one might discover Rowling's new world in The Casual Vacancy. What took J.D. Salinger to describe in The Catcher in the Rye, Rowling does in The Casual Vacancy, but across more characters and age groups. I am not saying that Rowling's work is inferior at all, but she can plumb the depths of the human soul with all it's earnestness, hypocrisy, pain, vengefulness, passions high and low, like Salinger. However, Rowling uses a dozen major characters, almost all well developed and tangible, instead of two. Rowling does develop the story around one character who dies at the beginning of the story, yet had provided a foil for so many citizens in his town.<br /><br />This story passed my nap test. Every Saturday afternoon, I sit in the car while one of my children volunteers, and I use the time to read, and usually nap. But I didn't with this book. It's not just because of her good reading, but also because there are so many characters, whose names are hard to keep track of. In fact, I made sure I finished it over the weekend, so I wouldn't forget who was who, who was fornicating with who, who was robbing who, who was beating who, who was doing drugs with who, and who composed the various love triangles. I am not diminishing how well Rowling incarnates her characters, the ability I really appreciated in the [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter]] series, but I almost needed a cheat sheet at the back of the book.<br /><br />Kids are great at seeing self-delusion in others, especially their parents. One boy reflects on his mother's complicity in accepting the abuse his father inflicts on the family. \\"He had always seen Ruth as separate, good and untainted. As a child, his parents had appeared to him as starkly as black and white, the one bad and frightening, the other good and kind. Yet as he had grown older, he kept coming up hard in his mind against Ruth's willing blindness, to her constant apologia for his father, to the unshakable allegiance to her false idol.\\" p. 289 Unfortunately, in the book, as in real life, the kids who can be adept at observation are not adept at solutions.<br /><br />There are bigger issues in the town of Pagford. In Mitt Romney's words there are the makers and the takers, and the makers are sick of the takers and want to hand the low-income housing neighborhood over to a larger, neighboring city. They are tired of having to pay to help these people who should help themselves. In the same way as the kids, they can see a problem but are not adept at compassion, because that involves cash and tolerance of difference, both of which the town councilors are feeling short. She portrays the convictions of the makers and their position without prejudice, but makes the case, using the lives of the makers as examples, that we can't know the depth of pain others walk around with, and which can drive some to more debilitating choices than others. In Pagford, at least, the makers are hypocrites.<br /><br />One of the Catcher in the Rye themes I always liked was the hypocrisy of the adolescent in search of authenticity. She writes like a mother of an adolescent when the guidance counselor wishes she could tell the kids, \\"You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.\\" p.88 Words every adult who works with adolescents or lives with them wishes they could get some kids to understand. But it's also Rowling's message to her adult readers.<br /><br />In case you haven't heard, this is an adult book. Rowling has an ear for slang, which was fun in the Potter books, but outside of Hogwarts, in the English countryside, f-bombs fall like dandelion seeds across every page. Not only are people using the word, they are doing it, teens and adults, and not behind closed doors either, Rowling brings us right into the bedroom, or behind the bushes, wherever people are doing it, and giving us a play by play. It was awkward for me. It was a little forced, as if Rowling could finally put in the scenes she knew were happening in Hogwarts over seven books, but had to wait for her first single adult book to try them out, all of them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, she is an excellent writer. She spins a good tale. She has a moral to her tale. It's influenced by her own experience as a taker for a time, a single mother in need of assistance. Her NPR interview is enlightening. It's too bad the some of the makers have no time to read this and think about why to live compassionately with the poor. However, not even Jesus Christ can get through to them. Now that she's a maker, I'm glad she hasn't forgotten her past, nor her common humanity. If your kids are only in the snogging stage, do not get this for them for the holidays. But if you are an adult, this book may be worth your time.y page.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie and found it to be very informational.  It is information everyone should know about. It makes you aware of where your food is coming from and what they do to it before you get it.  It was also good to see and hear about the farmers who are still trying to treat their chickens and cattle well including what they feed them. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes through this movie, we wouldn't have believe how cruel these animals are treated.  We are not trying to be vegetarians but we will be more careful what we buy.  We will only buy pasture raised chickens and cattle instead of what the most of the supermarkets are selling.  The animals are not only treated better...they are being fed what they are suppose to eat and not that GMO cornmeal. What they eat is what goes in our bodies. We all need to know what we are eating.  This movie gives you that information.  Well done!!

B004R0YHI0|3.0|This movie, based on a memoir by former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, seems to have its political views in the right place. That is, it's not afraid to portray the United States government as the corrupt organization it often is. The main focus goes back to the weeks, months and years after \\"9-11″ and the questionable war that started as a result. But the plot, which plays around Valerie's sudden termination from the CIA; the result of her ambassador husband publically denying that Saddam Hussein is using \\"yellowcake\\" to make weapons; doesn't really untangle itself until about the half-way point. From there, this Fair Game is two people versus the government in what is ultimately anything but.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00000E2WH|2.0|This recording introduced me to Sibelius and left me underwhelmed. The performance is so sluggish that I wasn't inspired to seek out more music by the composer. The Swan of Tuonela is lush and lovely, but Tapiola drags on at a leaden pace. Valse Triste sounds more like Armchair Depression. It was enlightening  when I got [[ASIN:B008BOWG68 Eugene Ormandy Conducts 20th Century Classics]] to hear the work conducted as an actual waltz. The sad smile is more touching than Karajan's drudging gloom. Unlike the flock on the cover, this Finlandia never takes flight.
1603429999|2.0|I'm not happy with the Kindle version of this book.Text embedded in graphics boxes won't enlarge with the rest of the page (remains statically too small to read).. This has taught me that not every book should converted to Kindle or electronic format, especially one such as this that might be used as a reference. If you want to be able to read everything you pay for, buy the real book and skip the Kindle. I'll never buy another knitting book in Kindle version.  Meanwhile, this book has little to offer to anyone who's already knit a project or two in the round, so it turned out to be a waste of money for me. I did pick up one tip (that really I should have figured out my own - duh) for starting out a circular project that makes it easy to switch to a different size needle after casting on as well as for not twisting those cast on stitches when joining in the round. So in that regard, it gets two stars..In my opinion, the book is intended for and likely only valuable to knitters who've never worked in the round before.  One caveat, if you are want to try magic loop knitting the author recommends a 40 or 47 inch circular for this method. That simply is too long a cable for knitting socks or mittens. You'll get tangled up in the cable.  For socks and mittens, a 29 or 32 inch circular is what you want to use. I use one regularly for these. You would only use the longer circular for a magic loop project with a much larger circumference, say a hat or purse.er circumference, say a hat or purse.

0525423656|4.0|I read Matched about a year ago, and didn't really care for it. While I didn't hate it, I had no intentions of reading the rest of the series. Spur of the moment, I entered a giveaway, and won! I have a great deal of respect for any author that dares to write a CLEAN YA book(or any book for that matter). I also believe that WHEN a person reads a book greatly affects how much they like or dislike a book. So! I decided this series was worth another chance.<br /><br />Crossed arrived in my mailbox on a Monday afternoon, and by Tuesday evening, I was finished. That's really quick for me! I'm apparently a slow reader. I know that a great deal of people can read a 300+ page book in one sitting, and I'm a little jealous. I can't do it. I liked Crossed, though, and I couldn't wait to see what happened. I wish I had Reached in my hands right now! (I have it pre-ordered!!) I also wish that I hadn't parted with my copy of Matched, because I'd love to re-read it. I also think it's a decent \\"boy\\" read. I can tell it's more targeted for girls, but it can work for boys. I think this could be a great \\"home-school\\" reading assignment, so it's going on my keeper shelf.<br /><br />I think with this read, I had a greater appreciation for the dystopian society. With the direction our nation is headed, I could more easily see this becoming a reality(not completely, but partially). It was scary to think about. When I read Matched, I was coming to the conclusion that maybe I don't like dystopians, but after reading Crossed, I'm wanting to get my hands on every dystopian I can!<br /><br />As I was reading, it seemed like there was more action than in Matched. In hindsight, though, I'm not sure. I can't remember a great deal happening.<br /><br />I'm definitely Team Xander at the moment! I'm not sure why, but I just don't overly like Ky. I don't hate him by any means, but not loving him. I wasn't sure in Matched that I recall, but definitely now. I almost never get my way when I love triangle is involved, though, so it's highly unlikely I'll be happy with the ending. ;P<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a series worth your reading time!<br /><br />Content:<br />There are one or two scenes that I remember where kissing is involved. There is a bit of violence. Da** is used twice.e is involved, though, so it's highly unlikely I'll be happy with the ending. ;P<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a series worth your reading time!<br /><br />Content:<br />There are one or two scenes that I remember where kissing is involved.

B008XG1X18|5.0|without the pinterest app, I couldn't repin things that I loved. the kindle would freeze up or if it did open to the pin screen, I would only have the first 5 or so boards and wasn't able to scroll through it to pin to the right board. All those problems have been resolved now that I have the app. I do still have trouble when I want to pin things from an outside website  using the app. I usually end up emailing a link to myself so that I remember to pin it later. I don't think this issue is specific to the kindle (it happens on my iPad too).
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow! Loved the deviousness of this book. First the husband seems evil, then the wife. Very cool!  I was never able to guess how it was going to end.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I absolutely hated the ending!!  Won't spoil it for those who will be reading it, but it just seemed like the author, who came up with the best characters, could have come up  with a better ending.

B008G8SFGO|1.0|70's Kiss is cheese and nothing special musically, 80's KISS is pathetic trash with them trying to be trendy, 90's KISS was a misguided heavier version of the insulting 80's kiss. The 70's Kiss look and sound is back sort of, but the songs are very poor both lyrically/musically and have these &#34;new&#34; craprock breaks in them which make the songs suck that much more.  This is just embrassing.  Bad, bad, bad music.  Kiss is just in it for the money they alays have been as t he just try to sound like whatever is popular, they have been copiers since they became KISS.
B0015AARJI|5.0|When I bought my PS3 slim, it only came with a basic 6-axis controller. While it works fine, this one has the rumble feature added. I bought this when it was a lightning deal.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rumble feature, this is the best one out there. Don't buy a 3rd party imitation, stick with a Sony original.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with these controllers, they are wireless and come with a 3ft charging cable. That is the only issue I have with Sony and these controllers. Who can play from 3ft away while these are charging? It might work on a smaller TV, but when I'm playing on my big screen, this wasn't an option. I picked up a longer cable so that wasn't a problem. You just need a USB to mini-B cable. They come in many lengths so pick up the length you need. I picked up two 15-footers.

B002XHN776|5.0|I am a music explorer, searching the flood of Internet media for new sounds, new ideas and new art.  While scanning cable one day, I happened upon a episode of Unplugged and caught 30 Seconds to Mars performing.  The first thing that caught my attention was the music, layered with predominant strings and moody, intelligent lyrics.  Then the small audience in the room began to sing; not just singing along with the lyrics but actually singing backup to the lead singer.  That's when I noticed the layout of the performance.  The strings, the singer, the fans all integrated into a single performance.  That's when I realized, despite my never-ending search for transcendent experiences in music, that I had missed something.<br /><br />While 30 Seconds to Mars may be little more than a side project to actor Jared Leto and his brother Shannon, they do stand out as an unique work of performance art.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I bought this game for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves the knock on wood game so I thought this would be a good addition. The basic concept of the game is to pick a card, then setup the pieces accordingly, and then start flinging the birds. If you get all the requirements, you get the point value.<br /><br />With this game and knock on wood, I simply just setup one scenario on one game and then setup another scenario on the other game while my daughter is flinging birds away at the first setup. That keeps her entertained. She doesn't quite have the setup down yet on her own, but that is great learning tool for her.<br /><br />I like the variety of setups you can do and most of them are relatively easy to setup.<br /><br />I would recommend this for kids 5 and up. They might not be able to setup on their own, but they can grasp the concept of the slingshot.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Disappointing as it could and should have been a better movie production.  The story line was very poor and the acting marginal.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I love the match 3 games when they have a progressive task.  It is easy to follow and understand the symbols.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|East read.<br /> All three books in the trilogy  should be read, to help the reader understand the first book.<br />Otherwise will it be a book written in a teenager style with adult content.<br />The last two books explain the actions of the characters as well as come to the conclusion what a healthy relationship is all about.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app it helps me in school and it lets me be able to right a book of mine.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A culmination of years of planning and preparation, starring so many superstars and with a terrific director to boot! So worth the watch!!

1476712042|4.0|I did it. I finally broke out of my normal PNR genre habit and picked this up when I was at work the other day. (I work at a small Indie bookstore).<br /><br />After about three pages, I was hooked and had to buy the book. Keep in mind, I normally don't buy books after three pages, but I couldn't help myself this time. After being introduced to Travis and Abby, I had to find out what happened.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is exactly that...beautiful, and disastrous. Travis and Abby have more highs and lows than a rollercoaster, and Beautiful Disaster sat me down, buckled me in, and didn't release me until I turned the last page. I devoured this book in record time and I have to say that I'm glad Beautiful Disaster was the book I grabbed off the shelf at work the other day.<br /><br />BD had me laughing, sighing, almost crying, and everything in between. The only reason I didn't give this book 5/5 is because Abby drove me a little batty. There were more than a few times when I wanted to reach into the book and slap some sense into her, but all in all, Beautiful Disaster was a great read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a book with high highs, low lows, and a bad boy. After all, Travis Maddox is a *great* bad boy.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|16 years is a long time to wait, but Soundgarden deliver with King Animal. It's Superunknown meets Down On The Upside with a little more of the former's sound to it. \\"Non-State Actor\\" will just rip you a new one and \\"By Crooked Steps\\" has a killer riff. The slower songs like \\"Blood On The Valley Floor\\" and \\"Taree\\" are very good too. \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" has a slick bass intro with that bit of Matt Cameron brilliance to it like PJ's \\"You Are\\" off their Riot Act album does.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Title is a little misleading and only by a stretch would the main character be seen as a racketeer.  But a good, easy read with a few plot twists.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|\\"I hate him for himself, but despise him for the memories he revives.\\"<br /><br />Published during the Great Famine, Wuthering Heights is considered by some to be the best book written in the English language. I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far.<br /><br />\\"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\"

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book is kind of typical of the latest works from Grisham.  It is okay to spend time reading this if you don't have other things to do.  It has some errors that I'm sure the editor let pass in order to get the book out.
B008G59IKO|2.0|After rushing out and buying Uno simply on the strength of \\"Oh Love\\" and being largely disappointed with the rest of the album, I decided on a more cautious approach to Dos.  I listened to the extended previews for every song and there was not one I was willing to part with my money for.  What I heard was inane cookie-cutter punkish songs with chidlike outbursts of expletives.  For the most part the songs didn't sound awful; it was worse--they were pure mediocrity.  This is not a return to their roots.  Instead, this sounds like a band reeling from the flak they took after the second rock opera (a third was not in order but would have been preferable to these) that they actually regressed in an attempt to rekindle their '90's success and failed to do so.  I have been a Green Day fan since 1994 and as such I will check out Tres when it comes out in January--not likely it will be any worse!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been quite a while since I read sc-fi this good, especially at the price. Well written, compelling fiction that had my eyes blinking and my butt falling asleep because I didn't want to stop reading. I found myself looking at the progress bar at the bottom of my Kindle like you would look at the level of a glass of fine wine, enjoying it but wanting it to last. Congratulations and thanks to Mr. Howey for this fresh, new foray into another world; a world of a twisted and dismal future, and what it might become. There would seem to be endless opportunity for this story to stretch in both directions; a well-produced movie could be fun, and imagine a video game titled \\"Silo 18\\", or some such.<br /><br />I'll be on the lookout for further episodes, hoping they will live up to this excellent beginning.

B008G59IKO|5.0|I enjoyed Uno which grew on me a lot!<br />Dos is growing faster than i expected and i have to tell you that it's the natural sequel of Uno for its particular sound.<br />Songs like Lazy Bones are amazing and could stay in Green Day's setlists for a long time.<br />So, keep rocking Green Day! We will always love you

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I purchased this case for my kindle fire shortly after I got it.  I really love this case for a variety of reasons. The outside is rigid. The kindle is held securely by 4 plastic clip s that don't impede the sound from the speakers. The covers are held together by a sturdy elastic strap and the back cover bends so the fire stands on it's own. I loved this cover so much I just purchased one for my spouse.

B008SVS3FC|4.0|I've always been a John Hiatt fan, but felt most of his albums/cd's had one or two or three weak links, not this CD, each song is GREAT, Hiatt with that perfect,simple eccentric poetry. All the songs are uptempo to some degree. John is another example of an Artist dedicated to being a better Artist day after day until the day he finally ecapes that meatsuit and heads out to some other type of gig, in whatever type of reality. Or maybe until he drops dead and they just toss him in a dark hole and throw dirt over him. In any case, I think my friends who like Hiatt are going to flip out when I take this over for a listen. Don't worry, I'll have the proper medical systems on hand. I wrote the following book and approved this review [[ASIN:B008BW5VSA Nobody Bats a Thousand]]
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was a great read. Couldn't put it down. Reminded me of the 50 shades of Grey books with a different plot. Defentally worth the money. Disapointed that I have to wait until May 2013 to read the 3rd book.

B002RXZF6C|5.0|Great classic movies
B009ERK1T0|5.0|They've changed a lot over the years starting from nu-metal and progressing into alternative metal. It offers a good variety ranging from slower ballads like \\"What Happened To You?\\" to heavier tracks like \\"Poltergeist\\". There's a very atmospheric sound to it like \\"Saturday Night Wrist\\" but it still has it's own original sound. Unlike a lot of bands that sell out eventually, Deftones never disappoint and keep getting better with age. They put a lot of effort into the album both lyrically and musically. The songs are complex, dynamic and very different from the rock and metal you hear on the radio today. They have their own unique sound and the album keeps your interest throughout. It's their best album yet, in my opinion. At least right next to \\"White Pony\\" but that's open for debate.
B000EHQTZO|4.0|a classic creature feature with all the elements for a good old adventure. It makes me feel kind of sad for the monkey though.

B002MG2RG0|1.0|I never got it. Cancelled the order after having a bad expierence with ordering<br />music CD's that I got, that were used and where case was broken & scratched up.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|2012 has honestly proven to be a very sad year in the world of music. No further proof of the sadness, is the deviating death of Whitney Houston. The last several years were so hard on her, that I think her heart gave out the way it did, and she died of a broken heart. I don't think she ever got over how hurt people have looked at her as the \\"crack is whack girl\\", that it hit her so badly, when she toured for her I Look To You album, she was heavily booed and dissed from her fans and critics as well. When that death hit, it really like a sledgehammer, especially at the timing of the Grammy awards. It altered the way we have seen the awards show, but how much the world was reminded of what a powerhouse Whitney has always been in life and in loss. Now a new hits album has came out, as a reminder of what made \\"The Voice\\" so special in the first place.<br /><br />I Will Always Love Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston isn't exactly a definitive reflection of Whitney's songs, but swiftly and simply plays more as a re-introduction to Whitney's immortal legacy. The collection really cuts it down to the core of her songs, by focusing in on her glory success of the 80's and 90's. When Whitney made \\"her-story\\" as a songstress that broke so many records from being the first female artist to have a album debut at #1 on Billboard, and her success in film with The Bodyguard, as the highest-selling soundtrack in the world. The collection includes her biggest songs including the definitive I Will Always Love You, The Greatest Love Of All, So Emotional, to the intimate Exhale (Shoop Shoop) from Waiting To Exhale and I Believe In You and Me from The Preacher's Wife. The songs have been remastered well, and show why her voice still stands taller than today's joke divas like Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry have put in their songs, a true lack of heart.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the collection does also have a few faults as well. The album does overlook many of Whitney's songs from her My Love Is You Love album, all the way up to her finale with I Look To You, and her work with the remake of Sparkle she did with Jordin Sparks. So it does sadly shortchange many hard core fans. You are not going to find great songs like Try It On My Own, the Oscar-winning When You Believe from The Prince Of Egypt, or Heartbreak Hotel either on this record. The new songs are also split as well. A new version of I Look To You is here on the album, where R. Kelly whom wrote the song for Whitney puts his voice into hers, and sadly it doesn't work. When I Look To You came out, the world lost Michael Jackson, and Whitney had a song hit a grand slam beautifully beyond words. He just whimps it out. The other song Never Give Up fairs better, as a song that really stands tall, and surprising was omitted from I Look To You when it came out.<br /><br />All in all, there has never been a definitive hits album of Whitney Houston's music and gift she showcased for the world. But nevertheless, this is a album I recommend for anyone who has not even owned a Whitney Houston album before, or a gift for a special voice in life.  I am convinced that no matter what singer has graced the stage whom has followed behind Whitney whether it is Mariah Carey, Leona Lewis, or others in suit, Whitney Houston will always be the #1 voice in my book. I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston is a great buy.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+om her My Love Is You Love album, all the way up to her finale with I Look To You, and her work with the remake of Sparkle she did with Jordin Sparks.

B005KELW26|5.0|I absolutely love this!!  It is just awesome, my KIndle fits perfect and it's the right shade of purple. I bought it for somewhere around $25 and saw it the other day at a store for $34. What deal I got!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Now THIS is how you make a great pop album.<br /><br />Christina Aguilera's \\"Lotus\\" has all the makings of a great pop masterpiece: stunning vocals, tight songwriting (in which Aguilera co-wrote nearly all of the songs), and a few potentially monster hit singles mixed in with some great album tracks and practically zero filler.<br /><br />On past albums, Aguilera kind of always suffered an identity crisis, as she could not seem to decide what she wanted to do with her amazing voice. The problem was not that she had a lack of good material to sing (except for \\"Back To Basics,\\" in which that was the case for the most part). It was that she simply could not decide which direction she wanted to go. Never was this more evident than on her past studio effort, \\"Bionic,\\" which had some tremendous individual moments, but was largely an uneven album and certainly a commercial failure.<br /><br />But with \\"Lotus,\\" she is content with the fact that she is making a sleek pop album, with state of the art production and some hot featured artists. \\"Army of Me\\" is a powerful track and a grower. \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" is her best pop song since the days of \\"Genie\\" and \\"Beautiful.\\" The Cee-lo Green contribution \\"Make the World Move\\" is a potential smash hit. And the smoldering ballad \\"Blank Page\\" reminds us all of who has the best voice on the planet.<br /><br />She still has the problem of overstating things and expressing misplaced anger (much like her vastly overrated contemporary Pink), and that can be heard on the track \\"Circles,\\" which is kind of an odd song for an extremely wealthy and successful mother who is in her 30's to be recording. But she makes up for it in the deluxe bonus tracks, as the song \\"Light Up The Sky\\" is breathtaking. So overall, this is a highly successful comeback, and sure to be a huge hit. The deluxe edition is worth every penny for the extra tracks.
0439023521|4.0|I loved the Hunger Games trilogy. At first when I heard of the book I thought it sounded stupid, but then when I saw a whole bunch of my friends at school reading the book I decided to try it. I thought all 3 books were great. I'm glad that I decided to read the books because it's my favorite series right now.
B008D19WBQ|3.0|the US box set if far better than the Uk box set by far ... on the upside the UK box sent has the extended bits in every episode :)

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a thrilling book that keeps you on your toes and makes you never want to stop. Loved it.
B00932HEX2|5.0|this is the only show i watch.  I never watch television.  I bought the series from Amazon after watching the first episode; i HAD to see the other episodes.  Please, Amazon, release Season 2--i can not wait!  (at least release the episodes which have already been shown on Showtime (i do not have Showtime...but i may have to get it in order to view the new season)!  The acting in this series is excellent and the characters hugely compelling.  Clare (sp?) Danes' portrayal of a successful CIA agent who suffers from bi-polar disorder is very realistic and it is heart-warming to watch an attractive, successful, complicated character who has a mental illness portrayed on a television series.  Damian Lewis is perfect in his role as a marine who was held captive for 8 years. Most important, this series seems to be the only way our country can talk about the war in Iraq/Afghanistan.  The show's creators/writers are very courageous and smart to invent these complex characters who carry topics (mental illness, the war...) which are not usually discussed in our culture and they make it absolutely impossible for us to look away.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love how far  they have come in their relationship. They are meant to be together.  I loved it !!!
B004EWFUQY|4.0|This is definitely a book worth reading. It opened my eyes to the importance of protein. However, when I tried it, I had difficulty with eating so much meat. I think I would prefer a diet that emphasizes other types of protein, perhaps soy. Most of the recipes in this book, however, are all about meat.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good book. Was not what I was expecting, it's quite a dark story. I fell in love with the characters. Would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />The book is way better than the movie, as usual, but still a good movie to follow up the book with.

0800177177|5.0|Here I am with another 20 years ago review this time for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Now I have never been huge into Vampire movies I mean I like Blade 1 & II in fact Blade II would be my favorite Vampire movie. The only other vampire movies I liked was Buffy The Vampire Slayer which I reviewed back in July. Lost Boys & Fright Night 1 & II. I'd say this would be my 2nd favorite Vampire movie. Cause it has some good perfomances. I can't say enough good about the effects & make up work & Francis Ford Coppola did a lot of good tricks behind the camera. Going back & watching movies that came out in 1992 this would probably be my favorite. Made for $40 million made $214 million directed by Francis Ford Coppola he directed all 3 Godfather movies which I might watch them 1 day. Apcolypse Now I need to see that 1 day & Jack I haven't seen that movie in a long time. Stars Gary Oldman as Dracula, Anthony Hopkins as Professor Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Jonathon Harker, Winona Ryder as Mina & Sadie Frost as Lucy. The story is in the year 1462 during a war with The Turks Vlad Dracula Wife Elisabeta got a false report of her Husband's death & she goes & kills herself. Vlad is told that she is d  am  n  ed. Vlad wrecks the church & renounces G  o  d. Gary Oldman does some great acting in this scene. He takes a sword stabs a cross blood comes out of it he drinks it & swears he will have his revenge using the powers of darkness. You get to 1897 where you're introducded to Jonathon Harker who is going to Transylvania to do a land deal Count Dracula has chosen Harker as his client & you'll find out why. Harker has a Fiancee Mina who & he's promised to marry her finally when he comes back. Mina has gone to live with her friend Lucy they have been friends since they were kids. You get to Transylvania where Harker is approched by this Coach & this creature whatever it is, is driving it & it is a great creature effect. He goes to see Dracula about the land deal the make up effects for the old man look are really good. Dracula is basically buying up all kinds of land in London. Dracula has Harker stay at his castle for a month pretty much he is prisoner. You have this weird scene with these female Vampires that are Dracula's Bride's they keep making Harker bleed to keep him weak. I found these scenes with the bride's weird but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Back in London you have Mina's friend Lucy courting men if there is 1 problem & it's not a big problem is I didn't care to much for the stuff involving Mina & Lucy. Dracula makes his way to London sneaks on a ship kills the crew turns into this wolf man lures Lucy outside where he r  a  p  e  s her & bites her & it begins a slow transformation.  Dracula appears in a younger form & stalks Mina. Harker escapes from the castle & ends up in Romania. He is being taken care of by some Nun's & they nurse him back to health. Mina gets word that Jonathon is still alive she tells Lucy who is very ill & acts out violently. Harker & Mina get Married they return to London where he spots Dracula only he's younger. Van Helsing gets involved who knows that something undead caused Lucy's condition. A ware wolf comes into Lucy's room attacks her & blood shoots everywhere in the room that was a very good effect. Van Helsing decides to finish her off so when they check her casket her body's not their Lucy walks down the stairs carrying a little girl this scene was sort of creepy. The movie has some creepy moments that are well shot. Lucy tries to seduce the man that was going to marry her Van Helsing takes a cross she backs up gets back in her coffin she pukes blood 1 of the guys with Van Helsing drives a stake through her heart & then her head is cut off. Harker joins up with Van Helsing to hunt down Dracula. Mina talks to this guy named RM Renfield who was 1 of Dracula's clients he went insane & believes that Dracula will give him immortality. A green type of mist comes in the area it kills Renfield he's slammed back & forth against the prison bars. Dracula goes to Mina's room now for those of you who have seen this movie Mina is the reincarnation of Elisabeta the music in the love scene is beatiful. The score by Wojiech Kilar is good stuff. The track called Vampire Hunters has been used in so many TV ad's & movie trailers it's a rememberble piece of music. They get back & find that Mina has been bitten Dracula is there & has taken the form of a man bat & again the make up effects are incredible. Harker starts shooting at him Mina begs for him not  to. Then Dracula goes from the man bat creature to a bunch of mice. Since Mina has been bitten she can read Dracula's mind & knows that he's going to Varna. Dracula reads her mind & evades them which leads to a nicely done finish at Borgo Pass. Van Helsing takes Mina to the castle. Harker & the rest of The Vampire Hunters chase after these Gypsies carrying this box containing Dracula. Back at the castle Dracula's Bride's come in & try to make Mina bite Van Helsing he takes a commuinion wafer & puts it on her forhead which weakens her he surrounds them with a ring of fire that protects them from them. The next morning Van Helsing decapitates Dracula's Bride's & throws their heads into the sea. The carriage arrives at the castle the hunters go after it. The Vampire Hunters pwn The Gypsies. Harker goes after Dracula & he pops out of the box Harker slits Dracula's throat. 1 of the hunters stabs Dracula in the chest. Mina asks Harker when her time comes will you do the same to me. Harker lets them go. Mina gets Dracula in the chappel the same 1 frome the beginning of the movie. Dracula is a peace & Dracula & Mina kiss he returns to his younger form. Mina shoves the knife into his heart & cuts his head off Dracula's Curse has been lifeted from her. Then she sees a fresco of Vlad Dracula & Elisabeta ascending together & it is a PERFECT way to end the movie on. I hope I explained the plot well in my retrospective. Other than the stuff between Mina & Lucy there's nothing wrong with this movie. Even the slow pace didn't bother me. The effects are great the make up effects are great you have a well done score. Francis Ford Coppola did a a great job directing. Gary Oldman was the man he was great. Anthony Hopkins did a good job not 1 of his more talked about roles. Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job except for his British Accient that was bad. Winona Ryder was fine. Sadie Frost was ok. The rest of the cast did fine for what they had to do. Do I recommend it? If you do not care for the current crop of vampire movies yeah maybe. I mean it's a 130 minutes so I don't know some people won't like a long slow paced movie. But the acting, effects & camera work kept me involved. Definitly check it out for the acting. Next will be 20 years ago Bad Lieutenant.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Love this Author! Great Books and they keep you on your toes! I'm on the third in the series.I hope there are more books to come .
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books, in my opinion, are fantastic. I love the story, adore the characters, and kind of wish that there was more to read! But some people, like my best friend, would disagree. These books are full of violence. If you don't like that, you probably shouldn't read it because it will greatly effect whether you enjoy these books or not.
1451620829|5.0|If you read a lot of rock biographies it becomes clear quite quickly which ones are going to hold your interest and which ones are just superficial schlock jobs.  Peter Criss' tell-all book isn't just riveting; it rivals Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt\\" as one of the most entertaining rock bios ever written.<br /><br />Gene Simmons' autobiography had its moments but the reader never felt truly invested in his personal experiences.  For a guy who claims to have slept with thousands of women, including a number of celebrities, Simmons' book was really just a \\"tell-some,\\" not close to a \\"tell-all.\\"  Ace Frehley's book was better and far more fun to read.  The Spaceman came across as weird and wacky and it seemed OK that you didn't get great scoop about some of the most personal aspects of his life.  Based on how loaded he frequently was, he probably couldn't remember!<br /><br />In the case of Peter Criss, though, memories aren't a problem.  Though he freely admits his own shortcomings, it's the devastating details he provides about his former band mates that keep the pages turning at a furious pace.  Whether he's describing Simmons' hygiene issues or regaling the reader with his own questions of Paul Stanley's sexual preferences, Criss puts his thoughts out there to the point of uncomfortable hilarity. Nothing is spared -- from his own drug use to his opinion of the sexual abilities of his wives and girlfriends.  It's as if he is telling his road stories to his best friend and not worrying one bit about who will be hurt by the information. Which, of course, makes for a great read.<br /><br />The highs and lows of Criss' life are somewhat predictable nowadays.  Many rockers from that era reached unimaginable heights only to sink to the bottom once fame and fortune disappeared. What makes this tome so much better than most is how \\"real\\" Peter Criss allows himself to be.  And it's why so many people dream of rock stardom and all it entails.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I got this toy for myself - I mean my 13 yo son - and it is definitely a lot of fun and educational if your child has an interest in mechanical things... However, I must say that Amazon is not always the best price as my wife found it for $33.88 in stock at our local Wal-Mart...
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child continues to put Jack Reacher in harms way, and I for one cannot put his books down!  Again, a great read from Child's.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My 25 year old son was reading this and recommended I read it.  I think after reading it, that I had read it before but this second time made it as sweet and memorable as the first.  We had a similar comment in our house for different reasons to not use the cancer card, so this bool reads close to the heart and very sweet.  It is not for one who dones not appreciate a true and romantic book about young love, but it is one that I enjoyed and will read again and again to remind myself how lucky I am.
B000NI8F5G|3.0|I had to watch this movie for an assignment in my Introduction to Film class. I'm not really a fan of musicals, at least not this type. (I love Repo: The Genetic Opera if that tells you anything.) This was surprisingly good, but I wouldn't watch it again. Not my thing, but it was good. I was a little worried about using instant video since I hadn't before, and the assignment was due in a day or two. It worked quite well and was spectacularly convenient.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Good not great--got boring at times but overall sort of a good rental.  Would I recommend it--only if nothing else is really on.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this is john grisham at his finest!  this is a real page turner!  he is a master story teller!  two thumbs up from me.
B0017R5UA0|4.0|Some great songs, and wanted to have it in my vinyl collection. I don't buy CDs or anything like that, just download MP3s but once I like something enough, it warrants to have it in a physical form. In comes my vinyl collection, which now has Fleet Foxes. Won't disappoint.
